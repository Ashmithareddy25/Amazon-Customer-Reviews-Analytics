B00005B36H|5.0|I read a lot of the reviews and I agree with some statements and disagree with a lot of the thoughts about tool.  First of all, comparing TOOL with Pink Floyd is an understatement and to fully appreciate TOOL I think we should all try to read each lyric that they write and try to find out for ourselves what they mean. I think if each TOOL fan would for example take apart Eulogy we would all be very suprised at what Maynard is actually saying.  His feelings on matters like the above may not be everyone elses but he has a valid point and comparing his thoughts in his songs and their out of this world musical talent with any other band that has ever existed is unfair.  I also think that it is impossible for some to even begin to see what he is saying in some songs of his unless some are brought up in a familiar setting.. So Ill give you a clue..Maynard was brought up as a baptist and I even though I think that religion is quite off the mark its a start for some to realize that he knows as some other do also, that some things are going on that we should actually all know about..or should we.
B000007T1M|5.0|Great Band, a good substitute for RATM. This album is like Devil/Clown metal. It's definately a metal album with high-pitched guitar riffs during the verses and strange but cool vocals. A very consistant album all the way through except for track 4. I'm also not the biggest fan of the track Spiders either. I don't know why this band isn't very well known, But anyways, you should definately get this album.<br />Can't wait for the next one.

0780624890|1.0|This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The acting was horrible and at parts, not-intentionally funny. It has some O.K. fight sequences, but aside from that small pro, there is nothing else to look forward to. When Blade grabbed onto the train going over 60 MPH, I fell out of my chair laughing. The sad part about this movie is it actually had potential. Luckily it was short because I have never looked at my watch so many times during a movie.
6305212139|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS VHS, ABOUT A YEAR &amp; 1/2 AGO AND I STILL LOVE TO WATCH THIS VIDEO. I HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DEVOTED TO THE SPICE GIRLS SINCE DAY ONE! AND I STILL HAVE TO BE ONE OF THEIR BIGGEST FANS! ANYWAY THE VIDEO BEGINS WITH A DISCUSSION WITH THE REMAINING FOUR GIRLS( MELB, VICKY, MELC AND EMMA). THEY DISCUSS EVERYTHING FROM MARRIAGE AND BABIES TO GERI'S DEPARTURE. THEN THE VIDEO PROGRESSES TO THE LIVE CONCERT. THE CONCERT INCLUDES ABOUT 12 SONGS INCLUDING SISTERS (ARE DOING IT FOR THEMSELVES- A ROCKIN ROLL DUET WITH BOTH MELS) AND WE ARE FAMILY. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO TO ANY SPICE GIRL FAN, IT IS TRUELY A COLLECTORS ITEM AND ENTERNALLY ENTERTAINING. xoxo MEL
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge is more than a movie. It's a spectacle that engulfs the audience long after the two hour running time expires. The film leaps off the screen and puts moviegoers into a front row seat at the legendary Moulin Rouge. Of course the stars of the film, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, play a huge role in bringing to life the bohemian world of Paris. The chemistry from the two leads ignite sparks that enthrall audiences and inspires the general theme of the movie, love.<br />The story is fitting for the context of the film, but at times the sets, costumes, dance choreography, and music can distract you from the story. None the less, Moulin Rouge excels at every level of originality. Put off seeing Pearl Harbor, and go see the fantastic Moulin Rouge!
B000002MP2|5.0|This cd rules! You have your punk-rock, punk-rock, alternative, rock, and just the beat to make you shake your head and turn the volume up loud! I just got this cd in the first place because it was at a used cd store cheap and my cousin had this cd and &quot;Time of your life&quot; wasn't bad, so why not? Well, when I first put the cd in and &quot;Burnout&quot; (the first track) was playing, I was yelling from up-stairs to down, &quot;Mom, this cd rules!&quot; Then after I listened to the whole thing I played it so much I knew all the words to all the songs in a week, without knowing any of the songs before. You might recognize &quot;Bacet Case&quot; from Weird Al's alternative polka on &quot;Bad hair day&quot;. I have that cd. You know what's weird? While I got this cd I liked the spice girls and the backstreet boys and I had all those teeny bopper posters. I NEVER got any teeny bopper cd because I was too busy getting all the green day cds. Soon, I took all the teeny bopper posters down and put up a green day one. Now I'm a punk-rock girl instead of a teeny bopper. I mean, green day writes their own songs and play their own insterments. Get this cd...if you like punk-rock or ska, you'll love this cd!
B00005BL2A|1.0|I consider myself a fairly loyal Depeche Mode fan, I have all of their albums (even Martin Gore's \\"Counterfeit EP\\") except some of the earlier 80's ones. I would be more specific and detailed if I could stay awake through even one of the songs.  It's all quiet ballads and ambient instrumentals.  This is not Depeche Mode.  Save your money for the next one, it HAS to be better.
078401213X|5.0|Pi staring Sean Gullette is one of my favorite movies.  Gullette plays Max Cohen a math genius attempting to solve the age-old mystery of Pi (3.14...).  Max's problems started when he was little, his mother told him not to stare into the sun &amp; so he stares into the sun.  The doctors did not know if he'd ever see again.  Apparently Max does recover but from that day on he has headaches.  Max is an anti-social genius who has myriad visions.  Not only that but he is paranoid &amp; has his apartment filled with computer equipment.  On his quest to find the answer to Pi he runs into evil Jews &amp; malicious businessmen.  Pi has profound hidden meanings laced throughout the one &amp; a half hours it plays.  For those people out there who love enigmas &amp; love to solve them, this is the movie for you.

0393314804|5.0|Irvines Welsh's, Trainspotting, is by far one of the best books I have read to date.  Welsh is able to take a simple plot, but still hold a readers attention.  He has a wonderful way of making the reader feel for his charaters.  No matter how demented and perverse they are.  He writes about the darker side of human nature. The parts we all have,  and don't admit, or refuse to ever put into words.  At least not as fluidly as Welsh. <br />I poured myself into this book.  So much so, that I had to read the screenplay for movie, and the screenplay for stage.  Each is a remarkable peice of literature.  Dare I be bold as to say,  a modern Sakespeare.  If you have only seen the movie, then you are missing out.  The wonderful use of scottish slang,  the charater interaction,  and pure morbity make this read a must for anyone who is sick of popular fiction.  This book is a part of a new wave of literature creeping over from the U.K.  In particular, Scotland,  and Welsh is just a part.  I don't suggest for the light hearted, and the weak stomached.  It does have that happy ending we all like though.
0385335482|5.0|This book was a great read. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I believe the other positive reviews here reflect my thoughts exactly. The only thing I'd like to add is that I could REALLY see this book made into a movie. For some reason I think Jennifer Aniston could play Rebecca Bloomwood very well (and Lisa Kudrow would make a great Su, too!)<br />It's funny and heartbreaking (and oh, so familiar) to see Rebecca trying to &quot;take control&quot; and for all her efforts she only seems to fall deeper into the spiral of debt. Admit it, how many times have you, like Rebecca, believed that you've truly &quot;done good&quot; in not spending money, only to find out that the cappuccino and the bonus-buy makeup sale and the sandwich and muffin and newspaper and the clearance sale and ... and ... all those LITTLE THINGS have totally blown your budget?<br /> For all you &quot;emotional shoppers&quot; out there who daydream about how the purchase of a certain item will change your life, this book is for you. And you know who you are....<br />If you liked &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; and &quot;Picture Perfect&quot;, then you will really like this book.

B00004XQP4|4.0|Those who have at any time have classified Green Day as a &quot;Punk&quot; band were stretching the definition of that genre far beyond its initial intent. Green Day, is and always has been a cynical, beat-driven, high-speed -- and darn good -- Pop band. They are the perfect teenage angst band -- too fast for Top 40 (and thus fringe) and just acerbic enough to seem dangerous to your parents. &quot;Warning&quot; is all of these things except high speed. It is &quot;Dookie&quot; and &quot;Nimrod&quot; slowed down to a traditional pop pace. That doesn't make it bad, just different and more acessible to the masses. The songs &quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;Misery&quot; stand up among the band's best work. If you like Green Day's work in the past, you'll probably like this as well (but you can still moan about the pace to prove you're a purist). If you haven't been exposed to the band before, this is a good place to start.
6303921248|5.0|I just finished and I am ready to watch again! I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  The love between Mr. Darcy and Elizabth is so wonderful it made me want to cry.  Buy this film right away
0345442989|4.0|Yes, it's mainly a novel of politics and intrigue, but it offers a much needed explanation of why things happened the way they did.  Luceno's return to the Star Wars universe is welcome; after the well-written Agents of Chaos duology, it's nice to see him tackle the so-called &quot;early years.&quot; Granted, there is not as much overt action, but a good book doesn't require a space battle or cooridor shootout every other chapter.  It's not for everybody, however; those of you who feed off of the...explosiveness of the X-wing series and others probably won't have an easy time with this one, so I'd recommend either checking it out at the library or waiting for the paperback. There is a level of maturity in the book in that it's not written for the younger fans.  Most would have a hard time grasping the political aspect of things.  All in all, I'd buy it, if only for the appearances of some familiar names and a taste of what to expect in the next film.
6305426651|5.0|This Italian movie is an extraordinarily powerful film that will haunt me for a long time.  Its about life.  Its about love.  Its about the holocaust.<br />The story opens in 1939 and the first half is a rollicking comedy of how Guido (played brilliantly by Robert Bernigni) woos and wins his wife.  He is a natural clown and his gift is quick thinking, fantastic timing, and outrageous acts.  He's lovable and optimistic and full of energy and life. However, he is Jewish at a time when Jews are being sent to death camps and he and his 5 year old son are rounded up.  His wife insists on following and she is sent to the women's part of the camp.  Guido wants to protect his son from the horrors of the camp and so, in his special inventive way, he spontaneously makes up elaborate inventive stories that are masterpieces of creativity.  The audience smiles through their tears as again and again Guido saves his son and gets messages of hope through to his wife, using his gift for comedy and natural joy for life in spite of the most gruesome of conditions.<br />I laughed, I cried and sat at the edge of my seat as I watched this video which is a celebration of the human spirit in the worst kind of circumstances.  The acting is fantastic, the direction great and the plot moves with the speed of light bringing the audience though an emotional roller coaster.  This is a serious film with an important theme and is extremely painful film to watch.  However, I have nothing but the highest praise for the filmmakers who dared to bring this epic tale of love and the human spirit to the screen.  The rewards of being willing to experience this video is a deepened appreciation for life and a unique prism through which to view the world. Highly recommended for those who can bare it.

B00003CXD0|5.0|Another of the many superb performances by legendary film actor Dustin Hoffman.  This is a very funny and entertaining film about a male actor who is down on his luck as far as his career goes, and decides to take an extreme measure by assuming a female identity to land a lucrative position on a daytime soap opera.  At first, the charade works; his life as a woman gain him wide acceptance and needed income.  However, along the way he inadvertantly breaks the hearts of three people, two men and one woman.  The problems become so bad he finally decides to abandon his female identity in front of millions of TV viewers; the resulting scene ranks among one of the most famous in film history.  Hoffman showed he earned a nomination for Best Actor Oscar and would have won if Ben Kingsley's performance in &quot;Gandhi&quot; hadn't been released in the same year.
B00003CXN4|5.0|As a huge fan of New Jersey Drive and Clerks, I was hoping Traffic would be the perfect middle ground. A film with these power house stars all traveling along on a highway giving witty commentary would have been right up my alley. But alas I was foiled into a great experience none the less. Who could have guessed this film was about the drug trade?? It gives an incredible insight into all facets of the drug trade, letting us see it from everyone's point of view. Asking tough questions of whether the drug war is one that should even be fought, or if the lives it saves are small in comparison to the lives taken to fight it. Then it swings around and shows the true devastation drugs can cause, making for a great theatrical ride. Also, I can't wait to get to Mexico. Cuban cigars and that totally funky lighting down there totally rocks. And Michael Douglas was forced to be with a woman his age, while his real life wife is hit on by Dennis Quaid. The one thing this film was missing was a totally hot chick. No offense to Mr. Zeta-Jones Douglas, but she was pregnant and average looking at best. I mean a top notch super hottie, Shannon Elizabeth for example. Not really to add to the movie, she could just walk around nude mostly, just for our pleasure. I have expressed this idea to George Lucas for the upcoming Star Wars film, and he said &quot;Genius.&quot; but he is not sure he can get it done. Finally, I just gotta give mad props to the That 70's Show star, Topher Grace. He plays the quintessential teen upper-class drug head, but he lets slip some of the movies most idiomatic lines. He has a way of commanding a serious sense of presence even when he is in all reality a punk rich kid. While not what I was hoping for, this film still succeeded on many levels. Watch it.
6302491940|5.0|The Italian Job is one of the most distinctive comedy films in British Cinema History, arriving on the scene as the 1960s were coming to a close and instilling a bright, colourful, energetic outlook onto the British public that was revolutionary at the time as the 'New Wave' cinema era began.<br />Relatively new at the time, Michael Caine took on the part of Charlie Croker, a criminal who has been released from jail and comes across a new job... a job in Italy.  But first he has to get the funding, and turns to Criminal Mastermind and Big Man, Mr Bridger, played by Noel Coward who adds a veteran aspect to the cast of actors; Even a young Robert Powell ('The Detectives') makes an appearance.  Reluctant at first, Mr Bridger gives the reins to Croker and everything goes to plan... although the training is a bit on the unsuccessful side!  They travel to Italy, run into the mafia, who aren't best pleased of their intentions and then proceed to bring the town of Turin to a standstill; With the help of Prof. Simon Peach, Benny Hill, who further establishes the film's comedic value!  The job is done, and the escape begins, with some breathtaking and enormous action chase sequences, as the minis come into play.  But things go sorely wrong and the boys find themselves in a predicament.... what will they do...<br />The film had huge support from Remy Julienne's Stunt Team and Giovanni Agnelli, the Fiat Giant, who released the Fiat town of Turin into the hands of the production team for a day of madness.<br />Having originally had a different ending to the film, of the team driving off into sunset, one of the producers came up with the current closure which leaves the film on a cliff-hanger, so to speak; which wasn't supported by the entire crew, but has proved to be a winner.  No other film has had such a open and inventive ending as The Italian Job.<br />The film is a perfect example of British inspiration which lead to one of the most influential comedy capers of all time.To me, the film truly personified the hopes and dreams that the 1960s stood for... a new Britain.  I will never forget sneaking down very early on Christmas Day, many years ago to watch the cheeky film... it's a feel-good film with some of the best lines in history.  You won't be disappointed in the least, with the action, acting or even story.
B000003TAW|5.0|I was (and still am) a huge fan of the early 90's alternative rock revolution. There were some truly fabulous albums and songs from that time.  This one came straight out of left field, and blindsided me. What great stuff!!! I know this is the unpopular thing to say because hardcore fans almost begin to loathe radio hits, but despite the fact that there are some very good songs on here and the overall cd is good from start to finish, 2 songs truly stand out and have stood the test of time....UNDONE and SAY IT AIN'T SO...the latter being one of my 10 favorite 90's songs. All in all, a truly great debut from a very underrated band...go buy it!!
B00004Z511|4.0|I had to get this one to see what the fuss was about. Radiohead's Kid A is really a must have for music collectors and Radiohead fans. I dont know if casual listeners would get it, seeing as how Radiohead has established themselves as innovative experimentalists in this limp bizkit, Blink 182 kind of rock world. The album is great, and I was not dissapointed at all, but for what its worth I hardly think of it as The White Album or Nevermind. &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot;,&quot;Idioteque&quot;,and &quot;Optomistic&quot; are my personal favorites. I think Radiohead is awesome and deserve more than 5 stars, but honestly this cd doesnt get spun alot in my stereo. It did for the first month i had it, but it didnt get quite as much airplay as OK Computer, which I think is more classic than KidA. Im anxiously awaiting Amnesiac.
B00003CX5A|5.0|After seeing the movie &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; which is directed by my favorite director, Tim Burton, I automatically decided that this would be my favorite movie of all time. I really love gory movies and this movie is far the goriest movie I have ever seen (This and Braveheart, of course.) and I was quite pleased at the graphics that this movie brought. My favorite part in the entire movie is when the headless horseman, played by Christopher Walken regains his head. This movie is a must see for anyone over the age of eighteen. (This movie is not recommended for the faint heart)
B00005BL2A|5.0|Depeche Mode is one of the most innovative bands in music, and sadly they sometimes get overlooked by critics and some of their own fans. Whenever I read a review of a DM album, some snot nosed critic makes a crack on their hairstyles. Listen up people: forget image for a second and listen to the band's latest Exciter. Just because pimply faced teenagers dont request them for TRL, doesnt mean theyre not good. They still have a knack for crafting beautiful songs about love and loss. DM has made some of the most memorable songs Ive ever heard and Exciter is no exception. &quot;Dream On&quot; is great, and so is &quot;Shine&quot;, which recall such tunes as &quot;Walking in my shoes&quot; and &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;. &quot;Dead Of Night&quot; is dark, with an industrial sound to it, and no I dont think it sounds like &quot;I Feel You&quot;, contrary to what some critics have said. Other highlights include &quot;FreeLove&quot;, &quot;Comatose&quot;, and &quot;I Feel Loved&quot;, which is suppossedly the album's second single. I think DM has made a good name for themselves and they are still as good as they were during the &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; period; if not better. Keep rocking,DM!! Only the fans could appreciate this one so critics, just go review Mandy Moore or something, okay?
B00005B1W7|5.0|This is a fascinating, first rate, astoundingly well acted TV mini-series bringing together two powerful characters -- Ben Gazzara as the Nazi hunter on a mission, and the mesmerizing Anthony Hopkins as the decorated doctor accused of being a Dr. Mengele-type experimenter on human beings in concentration camps during World War II.  It is hard to overstate how brilliantly well acted this film is.  The story is riveting and hard to step away from even for a moment.  If this were a book, it would be a page-turner.<br />Gazzara has never been better or classier and this is one of Anthony Hopkins' best performances ever.  This award-winning movie compares favorably with any other drama on a similar subject, including Marathon Man, Judgment at Nuremberg -- what have you.  The movie is bold, disturbing, engrossing -- and pulls no punches regarding the nature of the experiments run in the camps. Not for the squeamish.<br />I can't recommend this highly enough -- it was riveting television on first run, worthy of being a feature film, but it is richer for being a long-form TV mini-series.  Very serious subject matter, and very moving at times -- the wives of the two men are well played, agonizing over their husbands' struggle in court, with Hopkins' wife standing by her husband to the end, and Lee Remick as Gazzara's wife is great as well.  The climax is stunning.  Treat yourself to a wonderful piece of television and use it to educate a new generation of young people as well!
B00005J73X|2.0|Since 85 ive been a loyal fan to this band. Once i drove all night to attend to one one of their gigs and ive done so many things and spent so much money to support these guys, buying everything with the label bon jovi on it. after so many years of waiting for a live album im so dissapointed. I just wish that someone have had the interest to give fans something worth. I cant believe this album is out.It has a pretty bad editing, a terrible live sound, jon isnt singing at all, i mean, anyone could have done this album from their own home.one wild night 2001 is so popish that for a while i thought i was hearing ricky martin doing his stuff and besides, it aint a live version as it says on the album sleeve. I also didnt like the sleeve work. The song selection could have been so much better. I cant imagine a bon jovi live album without &quot;wild in the streets&quot; on it but instead i have to hear at Mr. Geldof. I think Bon Jovi still owes some fans a descent effort on a live album.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie has romance, music, comedy, wonderful cinematography, and the whole works.  Everything is like a wonder, the jewels, the dancing, and the songs.<br />Christian is a poet who falls head-over heels for Courtizan, Santine.  He seduces her with his enchanting poetic songs.<br />This movie is very moving, and I really enjoyed it, I'd recomend it... (however, anyone who didn't like the humor in Romeo and Juliet (Leonardo Dicaprio) this movie is by the same people and have that same kind of humor)
B00000634L|5.0|This is my absolute favorite CD I own.  Its mix makes it difficult for me to get sick of it.  I originally bought it because one of their songs was on the soundtrack for Practical Magic and I decided to stray from the Pop music scene and give it a go.  I superimposed it on all my friends and several have also fallen in love with its new sound.  I recommend it to anyone, since there is a little bit of everything for everyone.
B00000JGHM|1.0|maybe my expectations were too high but I thought this was a huge disappointment.  The action scenes were not exciting and I don't think they really did a good job with the story.  That whole scene where DeNiro and Pacino are in the restaurant talking seemed so contrived I just could not buy it.  Maybe with some more judicious editing I would have a different opinion, but I can't reccomend this film to anyone.
0312287550|5.0|When I first started reading Birds Of Prey, I was immediately hooked by the way the author lays out the story. I went on to read Monsoon and was over taken with emotion. I waited for his new book to come out(a very long time). I found out it had to do with Egypt(Warlock). I went to read River God. WOW! What a great read. Some readers will not like his way of words with violence and sex. I love it because he doesn't sugercoat anything. These books are not for children or adults who don't act like adults. If you have any interest in ancient Egypt, this book is for you. I have just started reading The Seventh Scroll which is a sequal that takes place 4000 years after the first story. If you like George RR Martin's fantasy novels you will loves these books by Wilbur Smith.

With rock classic like BLACK DOG, ROCK AND ROLL, WHEN THE LEVEE BREAKS and of course STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, this album is a must have for every music fan no matter the size. You can't get enough of this album you go back for more when its done. It truely is a great album. This is the album that all the bands try to make in their career, but come short.

B00003CXDZ|5.0|Pretty much everything has already been said about Moulin Rouge, and all of it is true.  It is everything.  No, really, EVERYTHING.  I can't really explain that, but if you have seen it, you understand.  It is a movie where everything is wrong, but somehow, by golly, it all works.  It's like eating too much candy, and still wanting more.

Its good to hear a friendly voice from the past excell.  <br />Always distictive, she puts it all together in this collection.<br />The songs are catchy and emotional even on first listening. I am writing this after hearing it through once, its sticking.  <br />Will wear this one out enjoying it.

B00005B36H|3.0|I've been a HUGE Tool fan since the first time I heard &quot;Sober&quot; on the radio 8 years ago. As soon as I bought 'Undertow' and listened all the way thru, I could tell right away that they had something special that bands like Guns'N'Roses and Metallica could never equal.<br />When 'Aenima' was released 5 years ago I couldn't believe it. . . Tool had actually created an album/CD greater than 'Undertow'. 'Aenima' was so perfect that it seemed the only way to improve upon it would be to make another 'Aenima' just with more songs.<br />Unfortunately we learned a few years back that it would be a long time before Tool would produce a follow-up CD, so when 'Mer de Noms' by APC was released last year I quickly picked it up. As everyone says, it's not quite Tool; however in a couple respects I like it even more than 'Aenima'. It is recorded so cleanly with alot more acoustical instruments and Maynard's vocals are extremely melodic and prominent. I even got to catch their tour openening concert in Portland, OR last February (simply awesome!) So it became evident, the way to improve upon Aenima would be to produce a blend between Aenima and Mer de Noms. Call it 'Mer de Noms' with more edge. It seemed so clear to me that I figured they must see it as well (At least Maynard must, right?!).<br />So sadly, here I sit. . . writing a review of an album that I wanted so badly to give the full 5 stars (10 if I could) but could only give a paltry 3. And why you may ask?<br />Here's why:<br />1) What the hell is Adam doing playing all over the top of Maynard every chance he gets? I get so annoyed during both &quot;Grudge&quot; and &quot;Patient&quot; that I find myself yelling at the stereo for Adam to &quot;Shut Up Already!!!&quot;<br />2) Who did the mixing? Most of the time Maynard is barely audible and by the end of &quot;The Patient&quot; I'm ready to break Adam's guitar over his head because of the overwhelming volume level. One of the best parts of Aenima was Adam's understanding that sometimes &quot;less is more&quot;.<br />3) Are there actually 4 tracks after 'Ticks and Leeches'? Sounds more like one EXTREMELY long track.<br />4) How many times can you experiment with rhythm timing changes in a single song? Listen to &quot;Lateralis&quot;, I lost count.<br />There are a couple of high points. Both Danny and Justin perform their parts very well. Danny is still by far the greatest percussionist I've ever heard.<br />Bottom line: I would rather listen to &quot;46 and 2&quot; 12 consecutive times than the 12 music tracks on 'Lateralus' all the way thru.
B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena McKennitt is a singer songwriter who defies generalizations.  While primarily in the Celtic tradition, she is always pushing the borders.  Sometimes traditional and sometimes completely inventive she is capable of perpetual surprises.<br />\\"The Book of Secrets\\" is a musical journey through the relatives and contemporaries of the Celtic tradition.  She mixes themes from Europe and Near East with the rhythmic and instrumental approaches of the Celtic world.  The effect is hypnotic.  The eerie and contemplative 'Prologue' shifts to the strong melodic work of 'The Mummers' Dance' recalling ancient spring rituals of rebirth.  'Skellig' has an almost Renaissance flavor as it voices the contemplative farewell song of an Italian monk.<br />'Marco Polo' echoes Oriental touches with Sufi melodies, capturing the ecstatic nature of that tradition perfectly.  The, in an almost magical transition McKennitt switches to one of my favorites, 'The Highwayman.'  This is a resetting of an Alfred Noyes poem, a dramatic stories of sacrifice and vengeance over melodic fiddle work and dancing drums.  'La Serenissima' is a return to the medieval contemplative, playing harp and fiddle against each other.<br />'Night Ride Across the Caucasus' uses Asiatic styling over the pulsing beat of horses in motion to recall the spiritual journey of the alchemist and the quest of the mystic.  'Dante's Prayer,' the final song of the album, is another personal favorite.  Occasioned by a trip across the Russian Steppes it opens with an echo of Russian Orthodox melody and then shifts to a melodic, contemporary sound as McKennitt voice sings a beautiful plaint that echoes the love songs of Sufi poetry, whose object is the Beloved, the divine.  \\"Cast your eyes on the ocean, Cast your soul to the sea,\\" she sings, \\"When the dark night seems endless, Please remember me.\\"<br />Recording quality is immaculate, with a fine atmospheric aura.  McKennit's voice is soft and full, possibly the best I've ever hear hit.  Her skill as a lyricist is every bit as good as her musical talents.  This is an extraordinary album which will provide countless hours of pleasure and thought.  Enjoy.r hit.  Her skill as a lyricist is every bit as good as her musical talents.

B00003CXDZ|1.0|This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen.  From the opening scene to the point of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, where I walked out, the movie is a total waste.  Unfortunatley I did follow the majority of the crowd who walked during the first 15 minutes of the film.  Nicole and the entire cast and crew should lay off the drugs and get back to earth.  Unfortunately Nicole's character did not die soon enough and spare the audience the pain of this horrible screeching and howling.
B000001ZS8|4.0|Moving away from his sweet '70s persona, Jarre enters with this album a different sphere entirely.  He still uses a remarkable combination of electronic sounds, many recognizable from his earlier work.  The simple harmonies remain, too.  But added is a large, sometimes harrowing palette of sampled sound...from Muslim chants to animal grunts...and Jarre uses them in ways that often make the disk almost frightening.<br />Laurie Anderson's vocal contributions are among the work's greatest riches.  Sometimes sampled, sometimes presented in straight vocalise, her trademark creativity meshes brilliantly with the new direction Jarre takes and gives his music the human touch without which it might have been no more than horrific.<br />&quot;Zoolook&quot; also breaks from Jarre's earlier style in presenting considerably harder rhythms that often look forward two decades to the &quot;techno&quot; revolution of the late '90s.<br />In sum, this is a disk tailor-made for more than just die-hard Jarre fans while still offering everything his loyal supporters crave.
0440412617|5.0|**************INCLUDES SPOILERS***************************<br /><br />I actually read this book when I was a young teen and I have to admit I was only reading it because there was nothing else to read in the house and the telly was on the blink.  I absolutely loved it from beginning to end.  This is a time-travel story with a bit of a twist.<br /><br />Charlotte Makepeace is a new girl at an old boarding school.  On her first night she goes to sleep in her bed and in the morning she wakes up as Clare Moby, a schoolgirl from over forty years ago.  Of course Charlotte is confused, even more so when people don't realise that she is not Clare, not even Clare's younger sister Emily.<br /><br />Somehow she struggles through her first day as Clare but to add to her confusion she finds herself back in her own time the following day and no one has missed her!  Charlotte soon realises that Clare is taking her place in her time and she is taking Clare's.  The two girls muddle through by communicating through Clare's diary, leaving each other notes and messages in order for them to survive in their swap-over worlds.<br /><br />However it's not long before Clare's younger sister Emily realises that something is wrong and Charlotte is forced to tell her the truth.  With Emily as an ally, Charlotte's time in the past is a little easier but there is a dark cloud on the horizon.  Clare and Emily are going into lodgings outside the school and the children have worked out that the time travelling that they are experiencing has something to do with the bed they sleep in and the tree outside the window which exists only in Clare's time.<br /><br />This is an exciting story that moves at a fair pace, even more so when Charlotte is trapped in the past, forced to become a day pupil and temporarily forfeit her real life in the future.<br /><br />Charlotte's identity is soon in question even to herself.  Is she Charlotte or is she in fact Clare?  Only Emily constant nagging about trying to get the real Clare back keeps the young girl aware of whom she really is.<br /><br />Charlotte experiences life in England during the First World War.  What once was history for her becomes the present, and she suffers with her new friends, as they loose loved ones to foreign battlefields, and face the terror of air raids in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Charlotte's eventual permanent return to the future is not without its own problems but luckily Clare had her own ally in the form of Elizabeth, a dorm mate who like Emily realised that Clare was not Charlotte and helped her as best she could.<br /><br />Charlotte's return to the future is not with out a tragic price.  Clare, Charlotte finds out died not long after her return to the past, from flu and for a while Charlotte is grief stricken.  However redemption comes in the form of a parcel of memories from a now grown up Emily who has waited many years to contact her sister's fellow time traveller in the future.<br /><br />\\"Charlotte Sometimes\\" is a surprisingly dark children's novel with flashes of colour and inspiration as two young girls live lives that are not their own.<br /><br />It is a poignant story about the loss of those we love and how we have to carry on no matter what.  A surprisingly mature book that can be read by both older children and young adults alike.et the real Clare back keeps the young girl aware of whom she really is.<br /><br />Charlotte experiences life in England during the First World War.

0553579908|5.0|i mistakenly read this book first and recently finished the first in the series and i have truly never read anything its equal. many say the numerous characters are to complicated for enjoyment but that simply increases the depth. i usually hate book written from many different points of view generally because each point of view tells the same section of the story over and over again in nearly the same voice, not so in martin's work. i found it amazing to the depths which he changes each character and constantly keeps you on your toes.        one thing i truly hate of books is he iron hard template many seem to follow with the damsielle to rescue and blah, blah, blah. martin enthralls you. it can't be put more simply. his descriptions of battles are wonderful, and this coming from a person who normally skips over the battle scenes. he doesn't leave anything out as his plot develops. instead of wondering how one character got there he tells you but never assumes you are so dumb as to need to be explained everythin. the thought provoking characters and creative style make even the most novice reader expect more from any writing. i would highly reccomend this to anyone. but read them in order! :)
B000002542|5.0|Words don't adequately suffice in describing the musical wizardy that is present in Journey's debut album. If you love later Journey (Infinity and later albums) you probably won't like this album. This is not a top forty love song album loaded with squishy ballads. This is straight ahead free form, guitar twisting, drum banging, bass plucking, keyboard pounding, Rock and Roll. No Steve Perry hear/here, thank God. This album was made by 5 guys who just plain loved what they did and probably could have cared less if others dug it. Fortunately it just so happens that many did. It is a somewhat unfortunately that Herbie Herbert basically forced Steve Perry into this band after their third album (which is also magnificient), thereby relagating the other members to dwell in the presence of his &quot;voice&quot;. Granted Steve Perry does have a great voice. But he doesn't possess, let along convey, the depth of vocals that Greg Rolie delivers. Steve has glamour and makes youngs girls cross their legs. Greg has substance, width and depth making anyone close their eyes and disappear in the ambiant gestalt that his vocals carry. And without Perry's vocals being the primary instrument, Rolie and Schon are free to feed off each and thereby creating dynamics similar to what professional sports teams win championships with. Needless to say, if you don't like this album you probably like Madonna and Prince.
B000006FYP|2.0|Many, many diehard comics fans butchered and moaned (and rightfully so) when the Batman film franchise was ripped from the hands of Tim Burton and placed in the trust of Joel Schumacher. For the purpose of making the franchise more &quot;kid friendly&quot; (and honestly, after Batman Returns, a film that had to be very jarring to some parents perhaps expecting something more akin to the &quot;Super Friends,&quot; who can blame them?) Schumacher took the movies away from the film noir-esque world portrayed in the modern comics to something more like, God help us, the campy 60s TV show. This change wasn't entirely unwelcome, at least not among mainstream circles. The fanboys screamed out their outrage. As with Cassandra of Troy, their prophecy of disaster for the franchise went ignored, but would find fruition in one terrible monstrosity, a monstrosity known as Batman and Robin. But let's take on the task at hand, shall we? If anything, Batman Forever is purty. A lot of thought and energy went toward set design, and, even if it is a bit tacky at moments, its rarely anything less than impressive and imaginative, especially the shots of the Riddler's giant &quot;brain drain&quot; tower, the Gotham City circus, and Two-Face's hideout. Sadly, though, this film could have improved ten-fold if half of that effort went toward &quot;little things&quot; like character development and dialogue. Here's one excruciating example from an exchange between Batman and the Prerequisite Love Interest: <br />Batman: The Batsignal is not a beeper.  P.L.I: I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional.  Batman: Trying to get under my cape doctor?  P.L.I: A girl can't live by psychoses alone.  Batman: Its the car right? Chicks love the car... <br />actually wrote down the entire romantic exchange in my notes, out of sheer masochism. Retyping it, however, has reminded me of the trauma of hearing it to begin with, and thus it brings back that strong urge to gnaw through my wrists, so I'll stop there. Sadly enough, both Val Kilmer and Nicole Kidman seem to be the only ones not letting themselves get in over their heads here. Jim Carey will never be known as &quot;that subtle guy,&quot; but I can't help but wonder if Joel Schumacher slipped him something during a few scenes. Its for Tommy Lee Jones, however, that I truly feel pathos. In the comics (the well-written ones, at least), Two-Face is a tragic, psychologically complex character who has through the decades evolved far beyond &quot;that villain who can't make up his mind unless he flips that damn coin.&quot; And I'm sure in a role more true to that, Jones would have done a good job. Here, though, the script (and possibly Schumacher as well, its hard to say) forces Jones to act only as a fourth-rate version of Nicholson's Joker, a role definitely unsuited to an actor like Tommy Lee Jones. Even one episode of the animated series that was running about the same time this film was released holds a more in-depth, mature take on the same characters.  Only Val Kilmer and Nicole Kidman seem to keep themselves unscathed from all this. Kilmer does a fairly good job as Bruce Wayne/Batman, although he can't seem to drop a mild look of disgust that follows him through out most of the film (its no wonder he was absolutely adamant about not appearing in a sequel). Nicole Kidman knows damn well she's just the Prerequisite Love Interest, and plays it up with dignity. In fact, to her credit, she's one of the few P.L.Is I've seen who don't at some point allow themselves to be reduced to senseless screaming fits. Its safe to say she probably pulls off the best performance in the film. Its certainly the most sedate compared to Jim Carey and Tommy Lee Jones' bizarre hysterics and Chris O'Donnel's desperate attempts to be the Bad Embittered Kid WIth a Heart of Gold (the Character-o-Matic, gotta love it). I know the tone of this review is harsh, and probably harsher than it needs to be. It comes from beinghappy with the first two films in the series, and then seeing the third taking a drastically different and less mature route. This really is in many ways a genuinely entertaining film, even if it requires dealing with some horrible dialogue and characterization. Essentially, what you have is good brain candy for some, but a bitter pill for a few others (especially most &quot;fanboys.&quot;) Also, in hindsight from a post-Batman and Robin world, I can honestly say....Batman Forever really wasn't that terrible, and that's the best recommendation I can make. <br />Rating: 2 1/2  out of 5<br />Grade: C 81%
6305949980|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas may not be for everyone.  Themes that include torturing Santa Claus, toys that assault children, and the absolute removal of all religious connotation to two very religious holidays may raise some objections.  That said, I think it is one of the greatest movies ever made.  Danny Elfman's score is a masterpiece, Henry Selick's mastery of stop motion animation is in its element here, and although Tim Burton did not direct the film, its got his signature all over it.  Jack Skellington's image has snuck its way into films by both Burton and Selick simply because they felt the final product was the perfect execution of a dream.  The more I watch this movie, the more I understand the sentiment.<br />I fell in love with this movie when I first saw it in '93.  My son fell in love with it six years later when he was 3.  A little young to be watching a movie with the aforementioned themes?  I really don't think so.  As a parent, I keep my child away from television or films that encompass any degree of violence (the absolute worst he sees is Toy Story; I cringe whenever Buzz and Woody start swinging at each other).  Yet I really don't find anything in Nightmare objectionable; Jack's motivations are nothing but good-natured, and the images of torture and assault are really nothing more than innocent expressions of the inhabitants of Halloween Town (they'd hardly be out of place on Halloween).  And that's really what the ultimate message of the story is: Hold on to your dreams, but don't lose sight of who you are or where you came from.<br />As I said, my son loves the movie, which means I've now seen it well over a hundred times.  I still love watching it.
0385335482|5.0|Wonderful tale of lovable if pathetic single girl who needs to grow up. I totally related! Hated to see it end even though the end is great.  I bought it because was looking for more Bridget Jones-type stuff. Now I think Sophie Kinsella is a better writer, frankly. I gave the book to my sister to read and she called me up and started reading it over the phone. I laughed as hard as I did the 1st time!
B00004XONN|5.0|why is everyone always trying to decipher and pidgeon-hole music, especially radiohead's music?  i mean, what counts is whether or not it is good music right?  i say it is excellent!  beautiful hypnotic and mind altering radiohead at their finest.  i personally like kid a more than their previous efforts, simply because it is much more mysterious, and still as beautiful as ok computer.<br />i can understand why fans may be dissapointed with kid a, because they may have been waiting for more &quot;catchy&quot; songs like on their previous cds, but i personally love the more electronic edge to kid a.<br />the only part of the album i didn't like was the horns on &quot;national anthem&quot;.  they didn't fit too well in my mind.  this album is a groundbreaking trip.  i can't decipher any of it, but i don't think i really want to.  no one can experience this cd the same way as anyone else, but i loved kid a.
0440234743|2.0|While the book was well-written, and there are certainly some exciting sequences, the book never really arrives anywhere.<br />Phelan's heirs don't come across so much &quot;evil&quot; as they do as victims of circumstances (a man who, rather than give his children care and love, just gave them $5 million each when they turn 21; he then took pleasure in seeing them waste it). Rather than making the children the villains, they become (not quite) innocent victims--robbing the book of much of the conflict one might expect.<br />Moreover, the last 100 pages peter to a close, without any real sense of urgency or drama.<br />I read--and enjoyed--&quot;The Pelican Brief.&quot; Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about &quot;The Testament.&quot;
0790734850|5.0|There is a moment when career-climbing cop, Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), hears the name &quot;Rollo Tomasi&quot; and the camera is focused closeup on his face and his eyes and we see him shift, and with him, the whole movie shifts into high gear.  It is now one of the great, classic moments of recent cinema.  <br />Prior to that moment, Curtis Hanson and company had set the scene, believably and meticulously established the time and place (LA/Hollywood early 50's), delineated the main characters and given us a mystery within a mystery.  This was done with patience and care.  (And an overdue antidote to the sacharine view of the 1950's).<br />After that moment, the momentum and pace pickup and everything starts rolling as all the pieces begin to fall into place and we learn with our lead characters the thread that has tied all these disparate elements together, all leading to a helluva climax with one of the best shootouts ever staged.<br />I love this movie.  It truly does rank with Chinatown in the pantheon of all-time great modern noir mysteries.  There isn't a facet of filmaking that was missed or fudged in making this.  It is first rate in all departments (cast, cinematography, script, dialogue, set design, costume etc.).  Too bad it got lost in the phenomena of Titanic.<br />Anyway, like Chinatown, there isn't a thing I would change about this movie.  It's as close to perfect as you're going to get.  A true modern Classic.
B00005214X|5.0|I've always loved this album, George Harrison's greatest work. I might be nitpicking, but.. WHY ON EARTH COLORIZE (ala Ted Turner) A CLASSIC BLACK AND WHITE COVER?? <br />Don't get me wrong, I REALLY DO appreciate the care taken in remastering this album, but i was REALLY DISAPPOINTED that the original cover was changed. How UNCOOL!!
B000000FG8|5.0|WOW.  amazing, powerful punk-rock.  this is punk rock, not green day, and ESPECIALLY not blink182.  if you want true punk that's hard, fast, and has a meaning, buy this.
B00005B36H|5.0|First,for all of you TOOL fans out there,this album is NOT,by any means,Ænima,Undertow,Opiate,or Salival.Therefore,it cannot be compared to those great albums.This album is something of its own.Dont buy this CD and think,oh this is Ænima,ect.This is LATERALUS! Ok,now for my review: This album is incredible,artsy,and smart.All the band members(Maynard,Adam,Justin &amp; Danny)gave their all.The album is great overall.<br />The Grudge - Great opener.Heavy,mellow at times,but heavy.<br />Eon Blue Apocolypse - Its not that boring once u get into it.Its an interlude.No words nessary.<br />The Patient - Love this song.Heavy,artsy,and a little mellow.Great lyrics.<br />Mantra - Consider this interlude a prelude to Schism,just like in the Schism video.Pretty cool.<br />Schism - Great single.NOt MTV type of song,so dont worry.Its a great epic,with heavy guitar riffs.Excellent effort.<br />Parabol &amp; Parabola - Both these songs will get you hyped up,especially Parabola.It starts off slow and quiet before leading you to a heavy music and a screaming Maynard.<br />Ticks &amp; Leeches - Heavy song thats adds to the hype.Near climax of album.<br />Lateralis - Title track brings you to climax of album.Heavy,artsy,and great lyrics.<br />Disposition - This is a slow mellow song.Not bad at all.Lets you know the climax is over and the heavyness is declining.<br />Reflection - Keeps some heavyness going,but still a slow song.Kinda mix of heavy &amp; slow.<br />Triad - Another long epic song,but is pretty heavy.Great closing of this great album.<br />Faaip De Oiad - Weird track.Its fuzzy with some guy talking about UFO's and stuff.Strange closing,but hey,this is TOOL.<br />Hope you liked my review.Thats all i have to say.
B00004U8P9|5.0|This movie is one of the most oddest and one of the most best movies that I have ever seen.  What gets me the most about this movie is that immediately after watching it I couldn't get the songs out of my head.  After watching this you will be humming or singing these songs for days after.<br />The songs are amazing, Richard O'Brien is a pure genius to have come up with the lyrics for them, and they are still fresh after 25 years even.  The sets are something to be seen and the story is very smart and the lines are delivered with enthusiasm.  Still on the topic of songs, when I first saw this movie I thought that the singing voices were not those of the actors, but I was amazed to learn that it was the actors real voices that I was hearing.  All the characters are ones that people can relate to.  For instance I related to Riff-Raff the often put-dowm servant to Dr. Frank 'n' furter.  This movie is one not to be missed and is a true gem for anyone who appreciates a good musical.
B000002UAU|5.0|...what this recording would have been like if the two best songs recorded during the sessions had been included (Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane)?<br />It's five stars already. It would have been 5 1/2 stars with those two classics. Penny Lane is the finest song McCartney ever wrote.
B00003BDXG|1.0|I saw Natural Born Killers a few years ago and it was one of the most dumbest movies I have ever seen.  What I hate most about the movie is that it tries (and fails) at being artistic.  This is evident in the use of camera angles and use of colors.  The main characters are the type of people you see in movies that you want to either be killed or arrested.  There is no way that I could feel any passion for either one of them, just hatred.  Watching the movie brought out the worst in me.  I wanted Harrelson and Lewis stopped, I wanted them to suffer like I suffered after watching this piece of garbage.  Oliver Stone has just lost &quot;it&quot;.  He doesn't have &quot;it&quot; anymore.  By &quot;it&quot; I mean fresh ideas and some talent.  If you have any self-respect for yourself and for others, stay away from this bomb of a movie and get something worth your time.
0767821769|5.0|This is an absolutly great movie, it will bring a tear to your eye, it is a must see.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|If you want to watch the movie, the only way I recommend seeing it is on DVD.  It has deleted scenes and many extras.  When I first watched this I thought I knew what I was expecting.  I thought that this movie would just be another one of those parody movies that spoof things like The Naked Gun and Airplane, but I was wrong.<br />This movie is one of the most raunchiest movies I have ever seen.  Usually that would be a bad thing, but here it isn't.  The scenes that were nasty (and there are a lot of them) were pivotal in telling the story.  When I saw some of the scenes I thought that they would just be pointless and stupid as they are in many other movies, but these were hilarious.<br />Many people might not understand my title for the review.  Basically it is saying that immature people would not be able to even understand most of the jokes in the movie, but a mature person would find the movie extremely funny and gratifying.  This movie has it all and I as a mature person (I think) recommend it most whole-heartedly
B00003CXN3|5.0|The movie offers a non-judgemental view about the drug war. It has mind-blowing cinematography, and an excellent cast. Benicio Del Toro (who won an Oscar for his role in this movie) is by far the sexiest man EVER, and a superb actor. He is like the icing on the cake for this spectacular movie.
B00005B36H|5.0|IMHO, this is Tool's best album so far; Keenan's vocals have never sounded better, Jones and Chancellor complement each other perfectly, and Carey's drum work is absolutely insane.  This album also finds Tool at their most diverse; tracks like parabol and disposition are incredibly mellow yet haunting, while tracks like ticks and leeches show Tool at their hardest (particularly at the end).  And while the prog-rock influences appear heavy (although i'm taking other peoples' word for it, since i've never listened to it), the hardcore influences have been strangely downplayed (again, refer to the end of ticks and leeches, 'cause it gives most death metal bands a run for their money).  Overall, Lateralus is truly a masterpiece.
B000053ZRR|5.0|This DVD concert is among the greatest you can see.  The performance is great, the crowd is unbelievable, and the DVD recording in Dolby 5.1 is amazing.  I thought it was much better than the &quot;Live in London&quot; concert because of the song selection, performance, and the audio sound.  Unless you sit in the front row of a live Bon Jovi Concert there is no way you can get closer to the action than by buying this DVD.
B00005K9LK|4.0|The Judas Priest remasters are well worth the wait, they sound great.  The extra tracks are nothing special, but it is still worth buying!!!!!!
B000035Z3K|5.0|Please limit wordy reviews.
B00005K9LN|4.0|This classic sounds a lot better now, the track listing is this way everywhere else in the world, only the american version started off with \\"Breaking The Law\\".  I like the remastered track listing better!!!
B00003CXN4|5.0|Traffic was an amazing film about the different views of drug trafficking. It shows you what it is like to be some one addicted to drugs, an officer trying to bring down drug businesses, a corrupted officer that helps drug businesses, the owner of a drug business, and the father of a drug attic. It really showed me what it was like to be each of these people. I definitely recommend buying this movie.
B00005K9LM|4.0|excellent remaster, again the extra tracks are nothing special, but who cares?
B000001ES4|5.0|There are times when words are incapable of describing something adequately.  Secret Garden's White Stones is really something that needs to be heard in order to be understood.  Even the small sound clips on Amazon cannot convey the perfect harmony of instrumental music that is contained on this disc.  Be forewarned there are no lyrics, not a single spoken word or voice.  This is definiately one of the most tempting lures to the group's body of work.  The music, lacking lyrics, really allows for the listener to create their own meaning for a given song.  The tracks vary in mood from the serene to \\"Celebration\\" pun intended.  The songs are intelligently composed, most with a contemplative aura.<br />Personally, I am yet to find a more satisfying compact disc than White Stones, even above this groups other work which is also exceptional.  Still, over two years after I initially purchased this CD, I still find it the most often played CD in my fairly large collection.  The songs are perfect for the drive after a long day at work to calm down, or just in the background when doing something else.<br />If you are just looking for something a little different from what is played on the radio, I think that you will find great joy in having discovered Secret Garden.
B00004Z459|5.0|this debut album by linkin park is the best $15 ive ever spent.  throughout the cd there are no bad songs, and their mix of rock and rap is done very well.  when i first heard them on mtv i liked &quot;one step closer&quot; and so i wanted the album.  I got it figuring that there would be a lot of bad songs but maybe id get my moneys worth. when i first listened to it i listened straight through without skipping a track because they were all good.  after that i figured that it would get worse after a while and all the songs would get boring.  but i was surprised, now nearly 4 months after i bought it i still love it, and listen through the whole thing.  not only that but the songs didnt get old, they got better and songs that werent so good before became my favorite songs.  so if you think that &quot;one step closer&quot; or &quot;crawling&quot; are their best songs, you should listen to the cd and youll find a new favorite.  another plus is that they don't swear at all so your parents cant restrict you from buying it and you wont get in trouble for listening to it.  to sum up, if you like rock, this should be the number one choice for you to buy
B00003CXE6|4.0|This is the best of the best pictures in ten years.  There has not been a best picture as good as this since &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;.  The special effects are average in appearance.  The acting has been well done.  The photagraphy was glorious.  It is a classic epic.  The story was a return to tradition(much like the old Roman dramas).  I highly recommend this to epic lovers or people who like well done movies.
B000002MFQ|5.0|I felt that this album was even better than the original which I first heard in 1972. He has matured greatly, and I can only say Mike improved on what was an amazing album to begin with.
B00005B36H|5.0|Thank God for Tool, I bought this album opening day and i have to say that i dont know how anyone could be dissapointed. I think this is Tool's best work to date, I loved all there pervious albums but Lateralus is just great. there arent any bands that come close to tools ability to make music. If your dissapointed with it just pop it into your CD played and just listen to the whole thing a couple times. at first i wasent sure what to think about this but this album has a way of growing on you like Pink Floyd's The Wall, Any Beatles Albumm Led Zeppelin Physical Graffiti or Led Zeppelin IV and so on. In years to come I belive Lateralus will be highly regaurded as one of the best rock albums of our generation. what a great way to kick off the New Millennium.
6304109318|2.0|A stunning John Malkovitch can't even get this movie off the ground! Julia Roberts gives a fine, nuanced performance as a Victorian woman scarred by neglect and harsh work, but the director can't get away from close shots of Julia's face to give us a clear view of the action. Malkovitch is his usual superb, dangerous self, but he is crippled by the director's obsession with Julia's visage. The book is worth a lot more,the movie is only useful as background noise for a game of Scrabble. Better luck next time, Julia!
B000001FCB|5.0|This is a beautiful piece of work, a timeless reminder of the genius of these two masters who are unfortunately no longer with us. That's why this CD is such an important landmark for the bossa nova genre. It is unencumbered by the heavy, Americanized arrangements that taint the early breakthrough sounds that charmed us all. For whatever reason, those producers decided that the beauty, simplicity and quiet soul of Gilberto and Jobim were not enough. Instead, the listener -- and the musicians -- were buried in sugary and superfluous strings and horns. Not here. You will hear a masterful combination of bossa, jazz and rock by two giants at the top of their game. Regina really torches the ballads, and Jobim shows why his songwriting belongs in the pantheon of the all-time greats, from Cole Porter and Jerome Kern, to Ellington and Gershwin. Check it out. And, hey, no English, either. It's the real thing.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|Okay, good stuff first! This movie truly is a visual feast! The computer generated scenes are great, the costumes are lavish, and inside the world of the Moulin Rouge there is always something to see, even when Nicole Kidman isn't around to rivet you with the perfect combination of beauty and hardness. I was delighted with her, which is unusual for me. I always thought there was something hard and glittery about her, even before she played this role, (It comes across strongly in *Eyes Wide Shut*)and I found that quality of hers offputting. As the &quot;sparkling diamond&quot; Satine, though, this same quality is used to Kidman's full advantage. She looks like a million, she sings great, and she carries of the comedic moments with style and a sense of fun. <br />Ewan MacGregor also acquits himself well as the wide-eyed romantic idealist. He is a helluva singer, and the fact that he has pretty eyes doesn't hurt.<br />But as always, the character parts make the story come alive! Tulouse and his pals, the Duke, the Narcoleptic Argentinian, and Ziedler all help to create the more side-splitting moments of the film. During the &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; number, I laughed so hard I choked on my drink. I mean, what more could you want? Here's fat old Ziedler with a lace curtain on his head dancing around with the evil Duke while scores of dancing waiters pirouette around them singing Madonna's famousy ditty about lost innocence. <br />Now for a few caveats: The film is VERY loud. If you see it at any theatre with surround sound, you might want to invest in a pair of the type of earplugs people wear to rock concerts. The music is loads of fun, but the volume is incredible.<br />The film is also very fast. The camera cuts and moves so quickly that after a few minutes I wanted to shout &quot;STOP THE WORLD, I WANT TO GET OFF!&quot; The lightning speed adds to the humor, in a sense, by giving an almost cartoonlike atmosphere to some of the scenes, but it severely limits the depth of the characters as well and there is little exposition about any of them.<br />All in all, I give this one four stars. It's a fun film to spend and evening with, even if it is a bit exhausting!
B000059R8Y|5.0|like gary moore i am so glad eric went back to the cardle days and decided to play his blues. my favorite song is the rockin blues number &quot;superman&quot;. on this cd there is slow blues and the rockin blues.
6304082428|5.0|I bought these videos not knowing what to expect and I can honestly say that I did not waste my money.  Colin Firth is remarkable and plays the part of Mr. Darcy extremely well.  I might add that part of Elizabeth Bennett is done well by Ehle, which truly does have &quot;fine eyes&quot;.<br />I was not disappointed in my purchase.  As a matter of fact I have watched it so many times that I might have to buy another set.  I'm quite sure I'll wear the tape out soon!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The music was amazing and I just saw the movie and I think that everyone should go out and see it!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I need to say that I have never seen a film that is more beautiful, more wonderful, and more unique than Moulin Rouge...in a string of summer films, I can see that this is going to be the best...it was so different from everything else I have ever seen...people left the theater open-mouthed, it was an AMAZING movie-going experience...this is definitely one of the best films of the year...artistic, powerful, and touching...it touched me in a way I never thought possible...this film is undescribable...people just need to see for themselves what everyone will be talking about all summer...take a trip to the Moulin Rouge and see for yourself...
B00003CXFG|5.0|This film is a very pleasant surprise.  Not a huge budget for sci-fi, but they made the most with what they had.<br />It isn't exactly the most original of concepts and borrows heavily from Alien and even 48 Hours.  This is a tale of evil monsters both human and alien.  The focal character is Riddick, a murderer being transported on a passenger liner.  When the liner crashes and Riddick escapes, the survivors fear him at first.  However as he states repeatedly, there are much worse things on this planet than him.<br />The suspense is thick and the acting is good.  I really thought that Vin Diesel was great as Riddick.  The effects are also excellent, the alien CGI is almost seamless.  <br />If you like science fiction that has good effects but doesn't rely on them solely then this is a film for you.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I saw this with my friends, and think we never laught so much in years. The actors, all of them, was superb and the upspeeded scenes, especially the one with the guy flying the airplane from the usa back to england was the funniest scenes in a long time. All I can say, if you loved Lock, stock & two smoking barrels you will simpley adore this one!! The same week i saw it on VHS I bought the DVD, have never happened me before!<br />...
0783114222|5.0|I really enjoyed the series. It shows all the problems which were involved, not only the technical ones, but also all the political and logistical problems as well. It very well reflects the enormous amount of money, resources and manpower involved in this grand event. Enjoyed it till the last minute.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I'd never heard DT before.Based on some reviews I'd read here at Amazon I thought I'd give them a try.This is a great band.Each musician is technically expert at their instrument.But it doesn't stop there. They play with intensity and emotion.I've seen lots of good musicians,Yes,Gentle Giant,Dixie Dregs,Return To Forever,Pat Metheny Group.DT compares very well to these groups.Thanks,Mr. Video Man, for focusing on individuals as they soloed.The video never got in the way of the sound and the sound is excellent.It saddens me a bit to think that most people will never hear this group of musicians because most radio stations are content with playing 3 chord- 4/4 time rock background music.If you like your music with some depth and variety it would be in your best interest to purchase this DVD.Listen to it with someone who also appreciates good music.Enjoy.
B000056NX4|5.0|This musical leaves all the others in the dust!  It is just oozing with amazing talent!  Glenn Carter is really good as Jesus Christ, and Jerome Pradon IS Judas--he is so good!  The first time I heard &quot;Heaven on Their Minds&quot;, I sat on the couch mesmerized.  You've got to see it to believe it!  And, for those of you who are partial to the original movie version, you can watch this new one and compare, contrast, praise, put down--whatever!  It is definetly worth your time and money!!
0141301074|3.0|IT IS A GREAT BOOK TO READ FOR ALL AGES.I READ THIS BOOK THREE TIMES. YOU WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK.OKAY THIS IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT.IT IS ABOUT TWO TWITS THAT ARE TRYING YOU GET EACH OTHER BACK FOR WHAT THEY DID. I HOPE THIS IS HELPFUL.ROALD DAHL IS MY FAVORITE AUTHOR AND HE WILL BE YOURS ONCE YOU READ THIS BOOK.ALL I WANT TO SAY IS THAT HE IS A GREAT AUTHOR AND THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!
B000000OTU|4.0|There are a lot of great Aerosmith songs on this CD like Janie's Got a Gun and Cryin.  If you are just a fan of the older Aerosmith, then forget this CD.  But if you like the new Aerosmith, then this CD is for you!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|It was fabulous!!  Nicole was at her best!  She seems to be doing fine without Tom!  Ewan was dreamy.  Really.  At first the modern music in 1900 France was disconcerting - but it quickly paled behind the story of the star-crossed lovers.  It had suspense, comedy, and drama.  All good.   I'm going back to see it again tonight!
B0000069NM|3.0|MMW are nice additions to Sco's guitar, but they tend to, well... wander. This a jazzy record, with lots empty space between the notes, one to snap your fingers and bob your head to. Pleasant enough, but not as groovin' as &quot;Bump,&quot; the CD that followed. (Disclosure: I did buy &quot;Bump&quot; first, so that undoubtedly influenced my perception of this record.)
0783225849|5.0|Psycho is one of those films that the public says &quot;started it all&quot;. In this case it was the key to horror films but Psycho isn't a slasher film at all! It's all about fear! Fear of death, fear of crimes, fear of being caught for those crimes,and the fear that the average person could follow through with a criminal act in the first place. Anthony Perkins is the everyman of this film.  He isn't chislied in the face or the body and some say the mind and when he finds someone attractive-well this film is so much a part of pop culture you know the outcome. But the film has some very creepy elements to it-you care for perkins in this film and after the deed is done and the infamous lake scene takes place there is a lump in your throat when the car with leigh's body gets stuck in the swamp. And that is the true basis of the film for no matter what act takes place on screen you never once view Perkins as a criminal or crazy until the final scenes of the film and that is pure Hitchcock genius!! While some may feel that time has tamed this films &quot;horror&quot; it hasn't lost a flicker of magic.  Because once you watch it you will always think twice about taking a shower!
B000002IZ4|5.0|I spent four years jumping out of planes in the 82nd Airborne Division.  There is no better theme song that I would want to hear piped through the cargo bay of a C-130 right before we exited the aircraft in the dead of the night carrying a hundred pounds of gear to bring death and destruction than &quot;Flies in the Vaseline.&quot;  It is a hard core pump.  The entire album has a huge number of successes, all for different reasons.  You could almost make a war movie to this album.  &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; would be the triumphant return home song for the paratroopers, and &quot;Kitchen Ware and Candy Bars&quot; would be what they played as they sat there and smoked cigars a week later in a bar.
6304119046|5.0|Citizen Kane has to be the most reviewed and discussd film of all time. Rather you are for it or against it one thing is certain the film can not be ignored. The plot is told in the opening credits through a newsreel flash forward after Kane's death, thus the information about the fims central character Charles Foster kane is established, the film then starts from Kane's early years of a child deprived of love to a wealthy newspaper tycoon adult void of a concious or a true &quot;love&quot; to call his own. But what makes kane an amazing film to watch is that it seems to be such an uninviting film to watch. Welles genius gives you this impossible figure for the viewer to empathize but as the film plays out you feel more than just disdain for the character but for the whole atmosphere of the film. Citizen Kane plays like a grown adults nightmare! Reality is twisted when the things in our adult life that we would love to own such as furs, diamonds and expensive homes are placed in Kane's lap and he not only loaths these material wishes but he buys nore and more of them as if one day they will magically fullfil the void he knows they can't fill. That is the magic and truth behind this flick Kane ultimately dies when all his materlistic needs are met and he suffocates in his need. Love, respect and happiness does pop into kanes life but when all is said and done the mere fact that Kane through out the entire film seems to relish the thoughts of wanteing to want makes Citizen Kane the most enjoyable film to dive into time and time again. And as for transition to DVD, the quality of the entire package is so well done and the picture so sharp you can actually count the whiskers on kane's face as he whispers his infamous dying words &quot;Rosebud&quot;! The film also includes the Oscar Nomintated &quot;The Battle Over Citizen Kane&quot; it details to great acord the war between Welles and Hearst (Kane is supposedly based on Hearst). Welles paints Citizen Kane in stark lighting, haunghting music and beautifuly dizzing camera angles and the pristine transfer to DVD is simply amazing.
0060975768|5.0|It's hard to describe and comment upon a book which is so emotive to a soldier.  I read this at the beginning of company command, and it gripped me very powerfully to the point of where I've given several copies of it to other leaders who worked for me.  It is especially relevant and poignant for leaders that are down doing &quot;muddy boots&quot; jobs, and is very contemporary in that it chronicles the perilous combat of the first air assault operation.  <br />LTG (ret) Harold Mooreimpresses both in his recollection, his frankness, and his connection with his soldiers.  He remembers everyone's name, their character, what made them tick, and truly painted an exquisite picture of the uniquely bonded community that is formed in a combat arms unit.  He did not shuck the responsibility of telling it like it was when it came to human failure, which is all too often a problem in today's military.  <br />Anyone who is dedicated to being the best they can be (and not the Army of One) will benefit from taking on the experience that is this story.
0060934913|5.0|Here's a question you've probably never asked yourself: What would you get if you combined a hilarious autobiography of an amazingly self-destructive (or so it seems) New York chef, a tell-all confession of the seamier side of the restaurant biz, and the best short cooking instruction manual ever written?<br />You'd get Kitchen Confidential, of course, an absolutely riveting read as well as an absolute must for anyone who likes to cook or eat in restaurants. Bourdain has written a book that is scattered, disorganized, jumps back and forth between biography and detached commentary One moment Bourdain is telling you about some terrible prank he and his sous-chef played on a waiter, and the next he's telling you how to make excellent stock reductions. Huge sections seem to be missing from the narrative, too; Bourdain sort of teases you with a lot of unanswered questions.  And yet, he still manages to be informative, compelling and downright entertaining. It's that kind of book.<br />Two sections of the book have gotten the most press: One, which first appeared as a short piece in the New York Times, is a sort of insider's tell-all of the secrets of restaurants, like why you should never order fish on Monday, or eggs benedict anytime. The other is a short chapter on how to cook like a professional chef. Both alone are worth the price of the book, and the section on how to outfit a kitchen will save the aspiring home chef hundreds, or thousands of dollars, while embarassing the over-the-top kicthen junkies with their $900 knife sets and racks of solid copper pans.<br />If you're the sort of person for whom food is more than fuel- the sort who would consider skipping a rent payment to buy truffles, if the occasion arose- you not only want this book- you need this book.
B000002U9W|4.0|Pink Floyd at this point was still a somewhat obscure band known about as well for their sound effects as for their actual music. On &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; we see the beginings of their success at developing a true synthesis of music with effects as opposed to a collision of the two. The title suite is a sprawling 20 minutes plus, with a horn section and choral arrangement. It is also laced with very intresting sound effects ranging from spooked horses, dive bombing planes and explosions just to name a few. Certainly one their most inventive compositions. The rest of the fare is a bit mixed. &quot;If&quot; is Waters' first real commentary on madness and in my mind, he states his case more passionately than anything on the over rated and over bloated &quot;The Wall&quot;. Wright's &quot;Summer 1968&quot; is a bouncy pop melody that while sounding very dated, has a great middle section and some of Wright's best vocal work. Gilmour's &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; is a pleasant folksy ballad that could have benefitted from better vocals. Too bad, because it's Gilmour who had always been the best vocalist in the band. The closing track, &quot;Allan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot; is more intresting when listened to on headphones for the effects. The music doesn't do too much for me until the last section where things begin to pick up. All in all, this is a must have. A year later, the band would release their first real masterpiece, &quot;Meddle&quot; which was far more focused in overall sound and songwriting.
0553573403|3.0|This is above-average fantasy, but Martin falls into a couple of old fantasy-genre traps.<br />One is the elevated narrative style. Why do fantasy authors trump up their narrative voices so often? Tolkien was great because he was one of the few fantasy writers who could convey a world of such incredible imagination with elegant, natural prose that didn't have any frills. Just because the story is set in a fantasy-type universe doesn't mean the narrative style has to have so many bells and whistles. A couple of examples: Whenever Martin has some guy eating breakfast, the character is &quot;breaking his fast.&quot; Why? When someone goes to the bathroom, he's &quot;creating water.&quot; Huh? If you write a novel based in the 21st century and use that language, your novel won't get published. For some reason, fantasy authors get away with it.<br />The other problem is that Martin, apparently trying to flesh out his child characters, gives the kids in this book monologues and thoughts that simply would not occur to children. It happens a lot in fantasy and in sci-fi -- Orson Scott Card's &quot;Ender's Game&quot; comes to mind. The worst of all in this book is Daenerys --- the girl is 13 and 14 in the novel and she acts twice that age. Most glaring, and a little perverse, is her sexual relationship with Khal Drogo. Aside from the fact that their first time borders on kiddie porn -- you'd get thrown in jail for posting that sort of thing on the web -- it is so unrealistic for a 14-year-old to act as Daenerys does that it just looks like Martin is trying to get his jollies. The image that kept coming to mind was the South Park episode when Mr. Garrison writes a romance novel and keeps getting, er, sidetracked.<br />Still, if you can get over those shortcomings, the book is entertaining. I guess you read fantasy for different reasons than you read great literature anyway. If you're in the fantasy mood -- hungry for solid plotting and a believable alternate universe -- this is a satisfying read.s is a satisfying read.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The theater full of people who saw Moulin Rouge with me last night loved it just as much as I did. It's funny, it's charismatic, it's beautifully mastered all around. The music is SO great! I got chills everytime Ewan McGregor sang, especially during his recurring duet with Nicole Kidman in &quot;Come What May&quot;. Also, &quot;El Tango de Roxanne&quot; is just a wonderful song, I can't stop listening to it over and over! Too bad they didn't add the hilarious &quot;new&quot; verison of Madonna's &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; on the soundtrack. ;)
B000002GGU|5.0|This is a great CD.  any person with good musical taste should own it!
0790729644|3.0|The Amazon *video/audio quality* review is a 4.5, but I would rate them a 2 out of 5 stars. I view on a 60&quot; Panasonic Elite Projection TV with high end audio system . Dark scenes (which are numerous) very splotchy &amp; grainey - very poor quality!!! Sound was not clear either. Transfer to DVD does not do this great movie justice; much lower quality than other DVDs I have.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in many, many years. The acting was great, the signing was simply beautiful (McGregor and Kidman can SING), and everything else was wonderful too. Moulin Rouge is not just a movie; it's a play, opera and musical all rolled into one. I have never seen a more emotional movie (probably due to the signing which really adds to it) or one filled with so many surprises. Don't waste your money on Pearl Harbor or A Knight's Tale (I did!) instead treat your heart and soul to Moulin Rouge.
0060278234|5.0|...then think again! Even though this book is somehow detached from 'Sabriel' it is still great. Sure it has the same caracters and new ones too but usually in a sequel the same antagonist is still being battled. But heck who needs another normal series! This was a fabulous book! The mystery that the disreputable dog and Mogget are harboring is still unrevealed at the end. Although I suspect it might have something to do with the begginning of the charter, I will say no more.<br />The main focus of the story is Lirael,(obviously, otherwise the book probably wouldn't be called 'Lirael')a sightless Clayr but who is also a very powerful charter mage and, as we discover at the end of the book, something more. Sam is the prince of the old kingdom and since his sister, Ellimere is destined to follow in her father's footsteps and be ruler, he is destined to folloow in his mother's and become the Abhorsen. Only one problem he is terrified of death, as well he should be, after anencounter with Hedge, a necromancer, there.<br />A must read for anyone who liked Sabriel or other books by Garth Nix.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|If all one can say in favor of a movie is that the costumes were great, this is a sad commentary about the film.  What a waste of resources -- time, talent, money, etc.!  Don't waste yours on seeing this picture!  Even when the viewer can begin to possibly enjoy the plot of this seemingly endless show, there are stupid interruptions with the actors trying to sing and/or be kitchy.  <br />This film is a poor imitation of other shows, a &quot;La Boheme-meets-The-Rocky-Horror-Picture-Show&quot; badly combined.  Go rent the videos of either, before spending your money on this bomb.  <br />I first viewed this film as part of a preview audience many months before the movie was released.  A large number of audience members who hadn't fallen asleep, actually walked out of this free screening!  That says a lot about this picture.  Even for free, people couldn't stick around!
B00003CWN3|5.0|Boys Don't Cry is an oldfashioned &quot;lovestory&quot; with a &quot;trans-sexual&quot; protagonist and it was shot so that the viewer is on pins and needles until the inevitable tragedy blusters through the &quot;myopia&quot; of small town members who realize they haven't understood this creature or his/her life. <br />The sad thing about this story is that it has heavy undertones and chords of &quot;shame&quot; which are very sad and reach through to the audience with a searing flame like a public burning  and yet is shot (unlike the stylistic &quot;The Devils&quot; by Ken Russell) with a strong identification with the oppressors, the men, the &quot;ignorant masses&quot; which is to nearly pardon them-- the ones who would have lit a bonfire and placed the human Brandon like Joan of Arc before her in what were surely labelled &quot;cleansing flames&quot; (a sentence which I nearly gag writing, and something which I could not watch were it not necessary for human beings to face some very unpleasant realities if we are to expect and spread the anthem of &quot;real change&quot;) as these men surely acted instinctually, yet here are potrayed as &quot;purging&quot; Brandon by making weapons, as in Kosovo, of their so-called &quot;manhoods.&quot; <br />When Lana in the end, begins to look at the &quot;boyish&quot; Brandon in the light of day and we feel her &quot;doubts&quot; it might be highly realistic  (in fact this movie is uber realstic with surreal cinematic swatches that are window dressing) yet it also again makes Brandon's outsider status and loneliness more monstrous as the tragedy plays itself out, considering his &quot;idealistic&quot; love of her which would not be bound by common sense.<br />The cinematography, close ups galore of characters flawed faces, and the beauty of life without a vaseline lens works here like a Brueghel print and the commingling of humans and stark environments work beautifully in scenes such as when the dustbowel billows and the navigation involved in driving a car is lost in a mist reminiscent which loses contact with the asphalt beneath it, and loses contact with everything outside of the encapsulated doom of a car with as much navigational plausibility as an airplane trapped in the Bermuda Triangle.  Have I used the word trapped? <br />The director, on this first effort, has created a &quot;new realism&quot; which tries to &quot;understand&quot; from all angles and make the pieces which can never fit to do that, and what is accomplished is something of a struggle with feminine nature itself.  It is here, in the impossibility of a woman to NOT be at least &quot;buds&quot; and &quot;dudes&quot; with a man that the true pain of womanhood is brought to a head.  <br />There is no room among the small town prejudices for an outsider like this, and even less room for a &quot;pervert&quot; like this and the strongest performance of all was turned in by Chloe Sevigny,  who as Lana indicated her awareness of the sick and twisted atmosphere by being the pivot around which it swirled.  Yet, she understood well enough that the society she kept and her mother's quite obvious religious feelings towards an ex-con like John were something more than dangerous.  Lana knew what it was to be trapped, and she was able to translate the anonymity and the stranglehold of her incapacity to Brandon who alive with love drew her to him/her in a way which could make fairy tales seem real and being from &quot;outside&quot; could offer a different perspective, tenderness, and love.  <br />  The movie became caught in the throat of Brandon just looking at bad girl Lana, a primary reason to stay on in the little community he'd run away to long after the signs were pointing towards a swift getaway. Yet Lana was the one able to say &quot;I don't care if you're a martian&quot; (to paraphrase her response to Brandon's &quot;dilemna&quot;) showing the LEAST need of a validating society.<br />The dead end lives of all these people (and the performances, all brilliant, not one less good than the next) could lead a person to pity, vexation, camaraderie, and abject hopelessness. <br />  There is no reason for them to find more or look further.  In a sense, there world and their lives work in a truncated manner because for them, that is ALL THERE IS.  And yet in moments of transcendence they are as open as the dusty highway, they come without batteries, and have nothing to add to their state as &quot;noble savages.&quot;<br />  If the world worked the way they wanted it too, the way it had worked the day before the &quot;uncanny&quot; appeared in their midst in the guise of a happy go lucky young &quot;wet behind the ears&quot; kid who made the mistake of falling for the mythological pivotal loving &quot;bad girl&quot; Lana-- the archetype of Lilith and Magdalene blended in with the Virgin; one feels that they likely would have believed no REAL tragedy beyond the commonplace sorrows would ever have occurred in that place.  <br />Much has been made of Hilary Swank's performance and after seeing THIS movie without visiting the &quot;documentary&quot; it is hard to see any other person, actually, NEAR IMPOSSIBLE to see another person in this role.  But when there are scenes that need a &quot;fiery&quot; &quot;touching&quot; sentience, and a &quot;glaring&quot; displeasure with the mundane realities it is not Brandon that understands the &quot;danger&quot; in being complacent in a world where no one dreams but Lana who's intelligence, and charisma could have charmed the socks off other sailors and sent them to their dooms too.  <br />The touching quality of a &quot;karaoke torch song singer&quot; a &quot;klumsy t-shirted siren with a cow collection&quot; was a perfect &quot;human&quot; counterpoint and her ease with herself and her feelings were a foil and a sharp contrast to the clumsy Brandon who appeared as strange to the rules of life as he was to the rules of a body he had initially disdained. <br /> Even in the scene where Lana pays visit to a confused Teena in prison who is still muddled and has a hard time surveying and understanding the danger his/her presence might bring to those, as unfair as that might be, that must stay behind and live in the small pond world of &quot;Here&quot; Sevigny transmits a subdued, loving, and carefree &quot;girl in the know.&quot;<br />For Brandon, young, in love, and a bit stilted as either a male or a female there was simply NO WAY OUT.  It is a great tragedy that some sick men who the director potrayed, in a hard edgy game as &quot;ordinary guys&quot; with &quot;severe problems&quot; provided the trapped young man on his journey inward with a permanent way out.
B00004Z459|5.0|Wow!  Boy howdy, this band is awesome.  I first heard One step closer on the radio, and from then on, I was definately interested.  But when I heard Crawling, I knew I had to get the CD.  And I haven't regretted it.  I have owned Hybrid Theory for around 3 months and still listen to it very often.  It's one of those rare albums where every song is good and you can listen to it over and over again.  Great riffs, perfect rythm, crazy turntables, and meaningful lyrics with the added twist of two singers make this album one to remember.<br />1. Papercut- this is a good song to start off with with nice lyrics and nice scratching effects.<br />2. One step closer- this one started it all.  A heavy song with lots of screaming to knock your socks off and get you pumped.<br />3. with you- another good song, but it gets a little monotonous. still good, though.<br />4. Points of Authoritys- This is the best song, no doubt.  Really heavy, with a really cool beginning and steady beats that keep you entertained and in the mood.<br />5. Crawling- a great song with a catchy chorus that will get stuck in your head for days.<br />6. Runaway- this song is my second favorite along with Pushing me away because of its loud beats and awesome chorus.<br />7. By Myself- this is a good metal song.  period.<br />8. In the end- a softer song with meaningful lyrics and great piano in the beginning.<br />9. A place for my head- this is fast paced and furious.  really cool overall.<br />10. Forgotten- interesting melody and nice singing by chester.<br />11. Cure for the itch- way to go, mr. hahn.  Sweet song even without lyrics.  mellow and buttery.<br />12. Pushing me away- a real tearjerker (sarcasm)  awesome song to finish it all off with great singing.  <br />So, as you can see, this album is a really fantastic one.  i await the next album.  get this one for sure!
B00005BL2A|3.0|People all over have been quite cruel to Depeche Mode lately.<br />Reading the reviews from other listeners of the album, I am fairly disappointed by the response which so many &quot;fans&quot; have had of Depeche's latest effort.  Even Spin Magazine ripped Exciter completely, and I usually trust Spin's comments on new releases.  Now, I'm not so sure anymore.<br />Well, let's get to the point here; the album is not truly spectacular, by any means.  It is no earth-shattering, ground-breaking album, as Black Celebration and Violator were.  It most likely, will not turn the music world upside down.  But it certainly is far from the band's worst attempts, and it is a valid album by one of the most underrated bands in the world.  And yes, they are underrated; critics mauled them when they first appeared on the scene, but twenty years later, people are still buying their new releases.  So there.  Ahem.<br />The album can be easily dissected for its triumphs and great flaws.  &quot;Dream On&quot; is probably one of the most accessible singles the band has released in years.  It's all over the radio, moreso than &quot;Home&quot; or &quot;Useless&quot; from Ultra were, and with good reason-- it's a damn good song.  Nothing lacking here.  Some of the other lovely moments of the album are the devastatingly good &quot;The Sweetest Condition&quot; and &quot;Freelove,&quot; songs meant to haunt to listener, which do so quite wonderfully.  Even songs that lack a bit in inspiration and spirit, such as &quot;Comatose&quot; and &quot;I Am You&quot; end up lodged into your memory.  &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; is probably one of the best dance beats the band has produced in a long time, as well.<br />Some lacking songs of the album?  &quot;The Dead of Night,&quot; perhaps, with its ode to the huge goth following of the band, with throwaway lyrics, such as, &quot;We are the dead of night / We're in the zombie room.&quot;  Also, the song &quot;Breathe,&quot; which seems to be the one key song where you can hear the stutter in the voice of Martin Gore's songwriting abilities.  For countless stanzas, Gahan just goes on naming Bible figures, which may have sounded more inspiring, had it been left to a mere stanza or two.  After a while, it just gets tedious and boring.<br />Exciter is not a bad album, by any means.  In fact, if you do consider yourself to be a Depeche Mode fan, you should run out to buy it.  Granted, the band's outlook sounds different since the members have cleaned up their acts and gotten their lives back on track, but the sound is new and fresh, not different and disastrous.  Expect to be haunted once again by David Gahan's gorgeous voice, and amazed at Gore's astounding writing talent... although, do not discount the possibility of being disappointed once in a while with the latter.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Following the success of her excellent debut record, Madonna took things a step further by calling on one of the best producers/musicians in R&amp;B/Dance music, Nile Rodgers of Chic. It was an inspired choice judging by the songs and performances on  &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;. Utilizing the Chic rhythm section on the whole album, Madonna and Rodgers crafted a unique and signature sound that firmly established her as a pop icon. &quot;Material Girl&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Dress You Up&quot; and the title track were all top five hits and still sound after more than a decade and a half since they were first released. Even non-hits like &quot;Over And Over&quot;, and &quot;Stay&quot; are strong tracks. A nice bonus to this newly(and very well)remastered edition are the original 12&quot; versions of &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and &quot;Material Girl&quot; remixed by John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez. I hope one day WEA will consider releasing all of the original 12&quot;'s on CD(hope you guys read this!). Madonna of course not one to stay in one place for any long period of time, began the first of many amazing musicial and stylistic changes, this album is still one of the best pop albums of the 80's.
0316743003|5.0|Rumor has it that &quot;Skunk Works&quot; is virtually required reading at the CIA. Author Ben Rich gives us an insider's account of what it was like to be a part of the famed Lockheed &quot;Skunk Works&quot; special team. The founding father was &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson,&quot; who formed an elite internal technical group at Lockheed that enjoyed tremendous independence from company management and was able to conceive, design and build high performance aircraft. They produced the U2 spy plane, the SR-71 spy plane, and the stealth aircraft, to name but a few of their famous projects. Just the story behind the stealth design is worth the price of the book. It all started with an obscure article on &quot;edge waves&quot; by Pyotr Ufimtsev, a Russian scientist. Denys Overholser, a Skunk Works mathematician was able to wade through the abstractions and extract the key mathematical concept that led to the design of stealth aircraft. Years later Pyotr remarked that his Soviet senior designers had rejected his ideas.<br />In the later chapters Rich becomes somewhat bitter. We learn that &quot;RS-71&quot; had to be changed to &quot;SR-71&quot; because President Lyndon Johnson inadvertently interchanged the letters in a speech. This required modifying some 29,000 blueprints! He paints a dismal picture of how we design and build military aircraft today. Engineering used to be fun, it used to be interesting, but today it isn't. I agree with Rich. Finance and bureaucracy drives everything at large institutions.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Who knew that two true hollywood actors could sing so fantastic? I don't think anyone could imagine this. Nicole Kidman sings so fantastic and, well, we allready know Ewan McGregor's voice from &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, but in that movie, he just had to scream some words out. Here he's actually singing and it sounds absolutely beautiful!!! I wonder if George Lucas ever have considered letting Obi-Wan siong a little solo-song while fighting with Darth Vader!?
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Just saw it and ready to see it again!  From the opening kaleidoscopic visions to the heartfelt ending, this movie delivers it all.  Nicole Kidman and Ewin McGregor are perfectly cast and surprised me with their singing abilities.  The use of modern pop songs worked amazingly well in this period piece and the use of Madonna's \\"Like a Virgin\\" was truly inspired!  A unique and special contribution to movie musicals.  Go see the movie and get the soundtrack.  This is definitely something to remember!
6303477259|5.0|I have been a bluegrass music fan all my life---I am a guitar and banjo picker.  However, I love classical music also.   BUT, when I saw Pink Floyd play Pulse, I realized that I was seeing the very best music of all.  It was 100 on a scale of 0-100.  It is astonishing.  I have bought 2 tapes of this concert.  After listening to Pulse 10 times, I am anxious to see it again.  A big mystery is why it is not yet on DVD. Someone is losing a lot of money by not advertizing this concert and selling it on DVD.
B00000DGUY|5.0|The first time I heard Mark Knopfler play that guitar I was driving through Queens heading for the Long Island expressway. Lucky for me my rental car had a good stereo and when Dire Straits came on I turned it up LOUD!! Actually Mark Knopfler was in the studio with the D.J., guiters and all.<br />Dire Straits became one of my favorite bands then and there.
B000001DTM|5.0|Most music critics would place The Joshua Tree over Achtung Baby.  Though The Joshua Tree is an amazing accomplishment, Achtung is even better.  In this offering, U2 solidifies its status as the best band of the late eighties and early nineties.  This is a concept album whose main theme is the highs and lows of a failed relationship.  Like most of U2's work, the lyrics are breath-taking and the accompanying music is unforgettable.  &quot;Zoo Station&quot; makes for an excellent opening in that it represents the beginning of a new and exciting relationship.  &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot; and &quot;One&quot; follow and will undoubtedly impress listeners.  Later, we have such classics as &quot;Whose Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses,&quot; &quot;So Cruel,&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways.&quot;  With &quot;Love is Blindness,&quot; U2's thrilling journey ends with the lesson that one must be willing to overlook the flaws of his significant other in order for a relationship to work.  Outstanding.
B000002MZ6|5.0|The first time I listened to this CD, I decided it was rather unspectacular space music.  A solid work, good for background ambience, but that's about it.  Then I listened a second time, and it got a little better.  By the third and fourth time, it was like I had figured out how to solve an Oldfield-inspired geometry problem.  With every listen after that, I think I finally &quot;get it.&quot;  I understand. Unlike most other CDs which are catchy the first time we hear them but then we tire of them after several listens, this is one of those musical experiences to go back to again and again. It will linger in your CD collection, and when you see it you will think: &quot;Oh yeah...let me hear that again...&quot;  It's transporting, evocative music that inspires thoughts and feelings about ourselves and our relationship to the cosmos. A truly masterful Oldfield performance.
6303430570|4.0|I wish I could give this film four and a half stars because it almost deserves five.  Some people will argue that this picture has no point and is light on story.  I totally disagree.  The message of this film is simple: if you are dissatisfied with your situation in life, stop complaining and do something to improve things.  The main character, Dante, is incapable of changing his life for the better.  Although he is sick of working at a convenient store and making nothing of himself, he has a tremendous fear of change.  Randall, who is seemingly afraid of nothing and operates the video store across the street, lacks the desire to do something more important with his life.  Both characters are smart malcontents who are obviously not getting nearly enough out of their potential.  Randall's poor treatment of the video store customers may irritate some of the film's viewers, but as a former video store employee who knows how stupid those types of customers can be, I found his behavior hilarious and I could certainly relate to it.  In a way, Randall is the person everyone would like to be -- rude, obnoxious, unafraid to piss stupid people off, outspoken, and irresponsible.  Dante, however, represents the type of person most of us are -- compromising, reluctant to take big steps in life, scared of confrontation, and dissatisfied with life.  Clerks is one day in the life of two kids in their early twenties and the bizarre events that happen around them.  The dialogue is great and the fact that the acting is not always great seems to actually help the movie in some strange way.  The black and white in which the film is shot is probably indicative of the dull lives these young clerks live, although there is nothing dull about this day.  Without a doubt, Kevin Smith's best film.  The cathartic speech Randall delivers to Dante at the end of the film makes for the perfect ending and adds a level of depth to the picture.  Though the awful language employed by the characters will not be enjoyed by many older viewers, Gen-Xers can certainly relate to the unique jargon used by those in the picture.  Excellent.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Just amazing...a must see and must own for any home theater buff. I can't wait to own it on DVD!!!! Go see it!!!!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|If you want to see perfectly accurate history or a dialogue that is above an average 4th grader's vocabulary, let me make a suggestion; read a book. If you want to see what can't be made in books like amazing special effects or highly engrossing action, see this movie. I'm sorry, but the average American is not up to the intellectual level of historical treatises/ dramatic literature and this movie like nearly all movies is made for this average American. If you are looking for an intelectual experience from modern, mainstream American cinema, good luck, because that is nearly impossible. If you can't enjoy the elements that Gladiator is unshy as presenting as its major attributes, maybe you shouldn'y waste your money. Otherwise, see this movie quickly.
B000003KMM|5.0|How could anyone love anything more than Major League?  My God!
B00005J73X|4.0|When I first heard of this cd, I was very excited.  I have been waiting for a Bon Jovi Live cd for years, living off of the live/bootleg material I downloaded on mp3.  While this cd is very good, it could have been better.<br />This cd includes some of Bon Jovi's best, &quot;Livin on a Prayer,&quot; &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name,&quot; and &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive,&quot; for example.  However, it lacks such great songs as &quot;Always,&quot; &quot;Bed of Roses,&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Road.&quot;  For the beginning Bon Jovi fan, this cd should be enough to satisfy you, however I feel that the lacking of these songs detracts from the cd.  Even though some of these &quot;missing&quot; songs were Jon Bon Jovi solo efforts, they should have been included, heck &quot;Rockin In the Free World&quot; is on this album.
0684800713|4.0|The Sun Also Rises (TSAR) chronicles the drinking and traveling of a handful of privileged young Americans in Europe. Picture MTV's Real World in the 1920's with lots of wine. And it's an all-white cast with one Jewish dude: Robert Cohn, a boxer from Princeton University. The Ivy League uber-honkies in Hemingway's TSAR talk doodoo about Cohn behind his back, but quietly. Aside from being known for its sneaky anti-Semitism, TSAR is famous for broaching the issue of male impotence during a time when the inability to get hard was simply not discussed or admitted. There is no definite objective or purpose in these people wandering drunk around Western Europe, but the story culminates in a quasi-pilgrimage to a bullfight in Spain. &lt;new paragraph&gt; This book is short and comprised of terse sentences, and is therefore frequently recommended to younger readers and people who don't care for long, detailed, flowery prose. But that is a big mistake: even though the words of this novel are easy to read, the 'meaning' of TSAR is layered and tricky. It takes you a minimum of two reads to actually understand it. (For me, I am still discovering stuff I didn't notice after my third time reading it!) If you have the patience to read the text carefully and severally, you'll see why TSAR is regarded as an American classic.
B00005JIZA|5.0|seeing john mayer in a smoky bar is what the experience is all about.  his shows will blow your mind, his voice will make you mad, and his energy will make your mouth drop to the floor.  but if you can't see him live, the next best thing is this album.  those of us who know john's music are proud of what he has done with these tracks and are proud of where he is headed, although as someone mentioned before, it will be painful for us once he hits the big time...he's been our best kept secret.  if you hear this cd, you will not be disappointed.  and if you are, well, you're missing out on something great.  something phenomenal, better yet.  check it out...john's the man!!!!!  it'll prove to be the cd you just can't take out of the player, trust me.
0446343129|1.0|I feel like this book was extremely ridiculous. William Duffy sounds like he has a serious issue with food. I wouldn't be surprised if he has an eating disorder. He talks about sugar as if it is going to be the downfall of the world. He goes back in ramblings of history which I feel, what in the world does this have to do with Sugar in the diet. I don't feel as if refined sugar is bad for you, if you eat it in moderation. It sounds like William was going bonkers with his. He sounds like He was bullimic an now he is suffering from anorexia. I think the human body does need carbs and sugars to help the body with its processes. I feel that unless you have diabetes, ketosis or are insulin resistant, yeah, carbs and sugar are not good for you. But if you are a normal, healthy human being, it is fine, your body can handle it. I think people need to stop drinking so much sodas and juices and pastries and candies and get in the gym. I am sure that will make them feel and look better. This guy does nothing but try and strike fear instead of help.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge was a fantastic film.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman shone.  Parts of it are so unexpected and unbelievable, but it's just plain amazing.  Highly recommended.  I'm sincerely hoping that this movie fosters the return of the musical to the big screen.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I have to add my two or three cents here, since I am SUCH a Depeche fanatic, and the reviews have been so mixed. I, too, DID NOT LIKE this album at all when I first heard it. Nor did it sink in the second time. Upon my third listen, I started to get it, and subsequently listened to the CD three times in a row, which I have never done with any new album. That's what it takes with this quieter, more introspective version of DM - listen very carefully, and the songwriting genius of Martin Gore makes itself apparent once again. And then there's the vocals of Dave Gahan - possibly the best he's ever sounded. A great, if not perfect return of my favorite band!! Don't cheat yourself by not delving in deep enough!
B00004XOWM|2.0|Let's start with the title, not only the winner for the Billy Corgan award for ludicrous monikers, but a title, like Mellon Collie &amp; the Infinite Sadness, that's a winking acknowledgement that the group knows what their stereotype is. Smashing Pumpkins knew everybody thought they were tragic romantics; Limp Bizkit knows everybody believes they're juvenile vulgarians, so they're ready to prove 'em right. And how do they do that? With a title that's defiantly vulgar but, more revealingly, embarrassingly awkward. The scatological meaning of Chocolate Starfish &amp; the Hot Dog Flavored Water is obvious to anyone that's graduated junior high, but it stumbles over its punch line, winding up as more bewildering than funny or offensive. But it doesn't stop there, or with the sickly cover art, since hot dogs and chocolate starfishes become lyrical themes on the album. Clearly, Limp leader Fred Durst takes some pride in his ass and dick joke, since he repeatedly uses it to illustrate the one theme of the album, namely how nobody understands him, especially in Limp Bizkit's year of success after 1999's Significant Other. He may occasionally attempt to frame his rage as us vs. them, as on &quot;My Generation,&quot; but he winds up bringing everything around to himself. Envision a Use Your Illusion where Axl Rose felt compelled to rewrite &quot;Get in the Ring&quot; for every song, just to make sure that you, dear fan, realize that he's persecuted and thank the lord above that you're there to understand him. And that's it. There's nothing else to the record. If the band supported him with sheets of noise, terrifying guitars, monstrous rhythms, or even a hook every now and then, Durst's narcissism may have been palatable, but the group pretty much churns out the same colorless heavy plod for each song. Combined, Durst's self-pitying and the monotonous music give away that the band bashed Chocolate Starfish out very quickly - it's the sound of a band determined to deliver a sequel in a finite amount of time. Since Bizkit has never relied on song or studiocraft, it shouldn't come as a surprise that neither is in evidence here, but the problem is they're fishing in a shallow pool. Previously, they had pent-up rage on their side, but here, the music sounds rote - when it gets louder, it signifies nothing, it just gets louder - and Durst can see no farther than his past year. That past year may have been a whirlwind of success and fame, but that doesn't stop him from dwelling on the people that have said bad things about him, nearly ignoring those that (somewhat justifiably) argued that he helped stoke the fires as Woodstock 99 in favor of the &quot;critics that don't get it,&quot; which includes a whole song sniping at labelmate Trent Reznor. Now, undoubtedly, there are some fans that will empathize with Durst, but the question is, will it really resonate with them? After all, everyone feels rage after being dumped by their significant other, but does everyone live in a world where they feel like they're attacked on all sides? Come to think of it, they do, but Durst's vision on Chocolate Starfish is so insular, it's hard for anyone else, even his bandmates, to come inside.

B00004T9UF|5.0|It's hard to know what to make of Eminem, even if you know that half of what he says is sincere and half is a put-on; the trick is realizing that there's truth in the joke, and vice versa. Many dismissed his considerable skills as a rapper and social satirist because the vulgarity and gross-out humor on The Slim Shady LP were too detailed for some to believe that it was anything but real. To Eminem's credit, he decided to exploit that confusion on his masterful second record, The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem is all about blurring the distinction between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and documentary, so it makes perfect sense that The Marshall Mathers LP is no more or no less &quot;real&quot; than The Slim Shady LP. It is, however, a fairly brilliant expansion of his debut, turning his spare, menacing hip-hop into a hyper-surreal, wittily disturbing thrill ride. It's both funnier and darker than his debut, and Eminem's writing is so sharp and clever that the jokes cut as deeply as the explorations of his ruptured psyche. The production is nearly as evocative as the raps, with liquid bass lines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes. There may not be overpowering hooks on every track, but the album works as a whole, always drawing the listener in. But, once you're in, Eminem doesn't care if you understand exactly where he's at, and he doesn't offer any apologies if you can't sort the fact from the fiction. As an artist, he's supposed to create his own world, and with this terrific second effort, he certainly has. It may be a world that is as infuriating as it is intriguing, but it is without question his own, which is far more than most of his peers are able to accomplish at the dawn of a new millennium.
0671034065|4.0|If you delight in language and bright, rambunctious, unihibited people that you wish weren't fictional, Mr.Perfect is your rainy weekend R&amp;R.<br />The plot apparently was derived from/inspired by a similar incident in England that had, if not the whole world laughing, at least the US and UK.  Seems a young woman and man had a great time together one night, and next morning at work, she sent an e-mail telling him, in detail, how much she enjoyed his prowess.  Of course, he had to crow to his male friends and forwarded the message to them.  They sent it to their friends, etc., etc., until the press picked it up.  The only danger of the couple involved was being fired, but Mr. Perfect is suspense, right?<br />The List of attributes of &quot;The Perfect Man&quot;--compiled by four friends at their regular TGIF supper--follows the same route but with devastating results and a surprising flourish at the end when the culprit is revealed.<br />Of course there are flaws in both structure and plot--Howard has her characters say nothing is perfect--but who cares when there's love, grief, and growth for both women and men characters as well as fun. Jaine and Sam--not to forget Linda--have my vote. Enjoy.

B000059Z8J|5.0|Without knowing some of the behind-the-scenes wrangles during production of 1978's Superman: The Movie, listening to the DVD commentary by director Richard Donner and &quot;Creative Consultant&quot; Tom Mankiewicz can be like watching Austin Powers without ever seeing a James Bond film--it's enjoyable, but you may miss some of the jokes. Whether there were legal restrictions or just a desire &quot;to work in this town again,&quot; Donner and Mankiewicz are often a bit coy when discussing the production.<br />For starters, there's Mankiewicz' title--he was denied a writing credit on the film, though Donner and others have praised him for reshaping the Puzo-Newman-Benton script into a workable movie. So his alternative designation appears right after the writers during the opening titles. Donner's grievances got a bit more press at the time. Producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind, taking a page from their Three Musketeers films, wanted to shoot Superman I and II simulataneously. Donner shot extensive footage for the sequel, but later had a falling-out with the Salkinds, who brought in Musketeers director Richard Lester to finish the sequel and re-shoot much of Donner's material. Knowing this helps understand why Donner and Mankiewicz take the occasional swipe at movie producers, and the Salkinds in particular. (My favorite: Donner praises editor Stuart Baird, then mentions how he's also directed two great films &quot;in spite of his producers.&quot;) It also clarifies some of their comments regarding plot points in both films.Originally, one of the two missiles Luthor fires in I accidentally frees the Phantom Zone villains to set up II. And the famous turning-back-the-world scene was initially planned for the sequel, to erase Lois' memory of Superman's secret identity. The commentary is just part of this well-crafted DVD, which includes an extended &quot;director's cut&quot; of the movie itself, two additional deleted scenes with Luthor (too campy by far, they were rightfully kept out of the extended film), and screen tests for Christoper Reeve and a slew of would-be Lois Lanes (after Margot Kidder, Lesley Ann Warren would've been my pick). Nearly a quarter-century later, Superman is still one of the best superhero films ever. I have never understood why so many people prefer Superman II, with its cartoonish comic antics and its make-'em-up-as-we-go superpowers (how about that amnesia kiss?). For my money, Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz made the definitive Superman movie--in spite of the producers.

I'd love to get my hands on her so I could scream at her for a couple of hours. I hope that she's ashamed of herself!<br />If you haven't seen it, there is another series out based on Heinlein's Starship Troopers. It's done in CGI and actually sticks to the spirit of the story while updating the story.
B000006E4C|5.0|when i picked this cd up, it was for the reputation of the composer and the cover art.  i had heard a trip hop remix of it and thought it interesting.  i havent stopped listening to 18 since i bought it a month ago.  its engaging levels of rhythm, the harmonic depth, and the pulses that flow through the music create an organism of sound.  one listens to the piece and feels let in on some celestial secret about how life was created: through pulses and surges of pure energy.  in 18, reich captures that feeling exactly.   this recording is full of vitality and is an example of very accessible minimalism.  some of reich's other work is less easy to listen to, but this piece has the perfect balance between the movement of harmony and rhythm and staying static for periods of time.  for the intellectual listener, the way that reich layers the sound is incredible to hear.  a must have for all.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|i saw this movie yesterday, you really get into the movie. its about a guy that comes to paris (ewan). and meets satine (nicole), the star of the moulin rouge. the guy is writing a play for the moulin rouge and the two fall in love. as the song says &quot;nothing will keep them together&quot; its true. the ending is very sad.
0679879269|4.0|This book doesn't quite capture the magic of Northern Lights and the Subtle Knife, but still Phillip Pullman displays his descriptive genius and his massive knowledge of physics and many other things. He just can't get the story off the ground so I didn't really have any trouble putting this book down.

B00004SYWZ|5.0|I have been a diehard fan of a-ha's since i frst received the demo of &quot;take on me&quot; at a college radio station i used to dj at.  They had a way with the synth-pop sound that no-one else could really compare with at the time. Although they are often lumped together with the likes of duran duran and alphaville, a-ha's work was always more pop oriented. They never had the art-rock flavorings of roxy music and could always turn in a catchy hook.  The problems were that their english was obviously a little weak, sometimes you couldn't really understand what they were singing, and they were victims of their time in terms of production.  Anyway, there is a progression in their work which I am trying to imply.  If you haven't been following them, don't start here, go back to the beginning.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have to admit this is a really good movie I'd rate it my 2nd favorite of all time (1st goes to 'grave of the fireflies' which is also a kickass movie but i don't know where to find it cause my dad got it at a pawn shop) its 12:00 AM! buy this movie or rent it you won't regret it. I promise. my fave character is Moro the white wolf god (shes a god even though shes female) i'm not much on information but take my word for it, it's really good!
0060934913|3.0|This is a difficult book to rate for my amazon colleagues. One's view of &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; may depend on a few outside factors: Those who are &quot;foodies&quot; AND live in New York City should enjoy it. Those of us (New Yorkers included) who like their meals plain and simple may not. Non- New Yorker/non &quot;foodies&quot; should save their money. A major point to be made is that this is NOT a tell all tale, so the word &quot;confidential&quot; may be a tad misleading. The author does, to his credit, include some eyebrow raisers about when fish is not fresh, dangers of well done meats, Sunday buffets and &quot;discount sushi&quot;. (There is an oxymoron!). Darker hints of sanitation, purveyor practices and the Mafia (this is New York, after all) are somewhat glossed over. These revelations are hardly scandalous! I most enjoyed the early part of &quot;KC&quot;, when Mr. Bourdain was getting started, finishing cooking school and surviving his first job in Provincetown, MA. That kitchen was a jungle and the author had yet to become a big shot. His move to New York may have resulted in a swelled ego. As a NYC native, I've heard so much of this before! Tales of life in big time kitchens such as the Rainbow Room, etc are nothing new, even tiresome.  A definite drawback to &quot;KC&quot; is Bourdain's personality, which frequently shines through as forceful at best, but more often just plain boorish. A second drawback is the helter skelter/jumping around during the latter (New York) portion of &quot;KC&quot;. Perhaps the author adopted this style purposely, to give readers a feel for life in a tough, competitive life in a tough, competitive town. Perhaps also, as &quot;Patient Spider&quot; noted above, the publisher was rushing to print!  This reviewer is confident that all readers will agree on one point: &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; is ESSENTIAL READING for anyone seriously thinking about becoming a professional chef OR about buying their own restaurant.  Personality and writing skills aside, the author rates 5 stars for career guidance. For &quot;KC&quot;'s other attributes, a star or two must be subtracted.
6305165912|5.0|This movie contains a bit of everything: Coen-esque directing, which is always a pro, a witty screenplay, funny storyline, very well casted, etc. I need not say more, this movie is truly a masterpiece, and should be given a place in cinema history.

B00003CXIY|5.0|I ahven't seen any other todd philips movis, but if i find out about another one, be sure that i'll see it, this movie is the kind of thing you'd expect from the farrelly brothers (dumb and dumber), however with a bit more class. Excellent performances from sean william scott, breckin meyer, and paul costanzo. This should be seen by any comedy lovers.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Wow, where to begin.  This film hits every octave of emotion, from true joy to numbing sadness.  If you can go to the theater with an open mind, just sit there and let the story and visuals envelope you, you will not be dissapointed.  The ONLY thing I regret is not being able to stay at the theater to see it again. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have a tangible chemistry, the screen (and speakers) resound with it every time they're on screen together.  <br />I can see where some people will not like this movie.  Those who are &quot;set&quot; in their ways and trained to like simple, predictable fluff.  Again I emphasize, have an open mind.  The first 1/2 hour will leave you *literally* breathless, your mind will be processing quicker than you're used to.  Just enjoy it, you will soon get used to the rythym of the movie, and the payoff is worth it.<br />I took my mother to the show, who at 68 is *extremely* set in her ways.  I prepared her adequately (open mind, let the movie wash over you etc.) and she *loved* it.  She is not an emotional woman, but needed a kleenex to get through the show.<br />Go, enjoy it.  Then go again and take a friend who needs enlightenment, who needs something to make his/her heart sing.
0790729644|5.0|This is a great movie, and the payoff is one of the best i've seen. Clint is at his best here, as well as Hackman. .
B000000H57|5.0|I can't think of the RIGHT words to describe such a powerful and moving cd. It's got such a mood that I want to explain to you it's power but it's too hard. Anyhow, it starts out on a funny note, the first track is silence and the next is the band talking about the album laughing and everything. Then, the real first song, &quot;Love You To Death&quot; comes on and it just takes you away. What a beautiful love song and it's got such a gothic and eerie feeling to it. &quot;Be My Druidess&quot; comes on next. It's got graphic sexual lyrics and is supposed to be spooky but makes me laugh kind of (I'll explain why in a little bit). &quot;Green Man&quot; is ok to listen to when you're going to sleep but is too drony for me. &quot;Red Water (Christmas Mourning)&quot; is a really downer song. It's ok but not my favorite or anything. &quot;My Girlfriend's Girlfriend&quot; has funny lyrics but Peter's voice goes too low and it messes up the cds overall mood. I really liked &quot;Die With Me&quot;, &quot;Burnt Flowers Fallen&quot;, &quot;In Praise Of Bacchus&quot;, and &quot;Haunted&quot;. The other ones like &quot;wolf Moon&quot; are ok and blend in. This cd is great to listen to when you're depressed because you get a very dark atmosphere surrounding you and it's very fun for me. Listen to this and picture you are living in Salem during the Salem Witch Trials era and you're walking on a wooden planked bridge at night with an eerie yellow moon showing and steam rising off a pond with the sky pitched black and the trees bent and crooked in a swampy type area. It's really cool and fun but may creep some people out too much. It's kind of funny when you think about the fact that Type O Negative are boys from Brooklyn living in the city and they're talking about druids and burning stacks of hey and witches when there aren't that many in the Brooklyn Zoo. Anyway, it's great music and a great mood setter so I encourage and recommend that you buy it immediately.

B00000I8UK|5.0|Out to Lunch! is one of the most important jazz albums of the 1960s. <br />The clarity of the recording, the individual space accorded each instrument, the meticulous attention to the nuances, the refined texture of the overall sound, the sheer presence of each recorded moment - these were the hallmarks of its sound. The coming together of Eric Dolphy, Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, Richard Davis and Tony Williams on Out to Lunch! was a momentous event. Dolphy had made a clutch of records for Prestige in the years leading up to this record, the most significant probably being the famous Five Spot live sessions with Booker Little that would promise so much but be cut short by Little's death from uraemia. Out to Lunch! was to be his single, most unsettling masterpiece.<br />It's not an easy album to become fond of. It insinuates melodies before it cuts them short, it ruthlessly breaks up harmony into fragments and it stretches the limits of tonality to extremes, but perhaps its triumph is that it brings swing into a new era. By giving Davis and Williams space and freedom, Dolphy let swing become a by-product of interaction, not a conscious contrivance. The rhythmic complexity of the record knew no precedent.<br />Tragically Dolphy was do die in Europe a few months later from an attack brought on by diabetes. He says on the liner notes, &quot;I'm on my way to Europe to live for a while. Why? Because I can get more work there playing my own music, and because if you try to do anything different in this country, people put you down for it.&quot;
1567184855|5.0|This book is one of the best and most helpful books on this subject I have every read, and I have read a lot! This book for me was like the key part to the puzzle that for the first time made all the other parts come together or make sense in the big picture type of way.
B000002I4W|5.0|It seems scarcely believable now that anyone could have regarded Ornette Coleman as an impostor. He was widely misunderstood when he came on the scene, often booed offstage and denied club dates by ignorant and insensitive promoters. Even seasoned musicians walked out on him.<br />It's interesting that albums with such grandiose titles (The Shape of Jazz to Come, Change of the Century, Art of the Improvisers...) should be in many ways so measured and reflective. But what is clear is that this was unashamedly challenging music. Ornette Coleman had invented something he called harmolodics, used to describe an implied harmony that emerges from the melodic line. The Shape of Jazz to Come is a supreme example of this new approach to making jazz. The music this quartet made was quiet, but the revolution it initiated was wholly indiscreet. No-one could be indifferent to Ornette Coleman. People called it &quot;free jazz&quot; and Ornette himself made a now seminal album of that name a few months later (Atlantic probably wanted to exploit the buzzword of the year), attempting to encapsulate the concept.<br />Free jazz actually developed into something quite different. But there is no question that the sense of freedom evoked by Ornette's visionary juxtaposition of spontaneous improvisation and structured composition is overwhelming, and justifiably caused both artists and critics to rethink the parameters of the music all over again. Shape contains the first recording of Ornette's most well-known composition, &quot;Lonely Woman&quot;, and the stirring &quot;Peace&quot;.
6303979882|5.0|I just love NOW AND THEN. It's about four best friends who recall their lives growing up as kids one summer. The film starts out when they are adults, going back to their home, and then it goes into the 60s when they were kids...and then at the end, back to their adulthood. The film is all about what they go through that one summer: hilarious moments, depressing moments, scary moments, and so on. They remember trying to bring back a 12-year-old boy who died and they remember trying to find out how he died. They remember stuff about their families, and they even remember the pranks they pulled on each other and pranks they pulled on a group of neighborhood boys, who also played pranks on them!<br />NOW AND THEN stars Rosie O'Donnell and Christina Ricci as Roberta, Demi Moore and Gaby Hoffmann as Samantha, Thora Birch and Melanie Griffith as Teeny, and Rita Wilson and Ashleigh Aston Moore as Chrissy. Devon Sawa, Bonnie Hunt, and Brendan Fraser also star in this delightful comedy classic. If you love coming of age films, then I definitely suggest this to your collection. NOW AND THEN is a wonderful film with excellent acting and a terrific screenplay. Go and buy it!
B00005B58Y|5.0|This is a staggering album... The title tune &quot;Milestones&quot; is now a classic. The theme is fascinating not for what is played but for what is implied. You hear yourself singing harmonies all around those that you actually hear. And the rhythm section is just rocking; Philly Joe's drumming is dense with swirling cymbals and rapid-fire rolls, his excitement and passion overpowering. And then, Cannonball Adderley at his most joyous, breaks in with a solo that almost on its own takes the jazz soloing of the era into a whole new expressive dimension. One hearing of this massive record and it feels like you've known it all your life.
B000002MP2|5.0|If there was one cd that I could put into a time capsule to show the world in 100 years it would most probably be Green Day's captivating album &quot;Dookie&quot;. Forget Lit, and any other such group that has jumped on the punk bandwagon, Green Day will always be sky high above them.  This is by far the best Green Day album compiled at the height of their careers. With four top singles including &quot;Basket Case&quot; and &quot;When I Come Around&quot; it captivates the very magic that made Green Day over night stars. Buy it!
B000000YG5|5.0|Rollins recorded extensively in 1956 and committed hours of fantastic music to vinyl for Prestige. His apogee was Colossus. Never mind the lack of irony in the album's title: this was the state of the tenor in 1956. The opening \\"St. Thomas\\" is a calypso, performed by Rollins in homage to the music of the Virgin Islands, from which his family came. An opening like that would perhaps lead one to expect a playful record. But what is to come is no mere light-hearted experiment in festivity. Rollins explores territories in which improvisation and composition become indistinguishable.<br />A now famous analysis by Gunther Schuller of \\"Blue 7\\" described Rollins' development of the solo as \\"thematic\\": the construction of the solo was derived from elaborate phrasing, building towards greater complexity until final resolution, like a formal composition. Weil and Brecht's \\"Moritat\\" (a.k.a. \\"Mack the Knife\\") gets an astonishing reading, but the peak of the album's intensity might be the dialogue between Rollins and Max Roach on \\"Strode Rode\\". The symbiosis is so complete that one is tempted to regard the relationship as structural. Yet for all these academic observations, few great records in jazz have ever sounded so effortless and uncontrived. That is the triumph of this album. Play it again and again, you'll never get enough.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I have had the VHS complete set of Fawlty Towers for 6 years now, even though I don't own a VCR! I had originally made Super Beta copies of the entire series when they broadcast it on MTV (of all places) in 1991. When my Beta VCR wore out I bought the VHS edition of Fawlty Towers thinking I was going to change over to VHS. I never did.   I kept the VHS copy of Fawlty Towers all these years because it was the only video copy I had, I loved the series too much to let it go. I am a serious Monty Python fan (I own the entire 12 sets of Monty Python on DVD) but I have always admired the work of John Cleese after he left Monty Python and now we finally have the entire Fawlty Towers series coming out on DVD.   There were not that many shows made but the scripts, timing, punch lines, over comedic acting and pace are the BEST comedy that ever came from England. I would compare it to Your Show of Shows by Sid Caesar, not Monty Python. . . the only dissapointing thing is you will have to wait until October 2001 for it ot come out on DVD.
B0000046NB|4.0|From the very opening bars of &quot;Lullaby of Birdland&quot;, the sweet interplay of Vaughan's velvet voice and Brownie's mellifluous trumpet make this recording truly wonderful. Brownie took a break from the illustrious Max Roach Quintet to play with Vaughan and a band put together for the date.<br />It exudes the aura of great occasions - collective confidence, fluid ideas and the chemistry of a fresh association. It's one of those records that leave you yearning for more; her later After Hours (1961) is similarly frustrating in length. But a concentrated selection of superbly executed songs is like a little treat. Her command of the material's harmonic intricacies is all the more remarkable for the ease and grace with which she delivers it. On this recording Sarah Vaughan exhibited her elegant phrasing with awesome mastery.
0060278234|5.0|I was astonished to find that this series was young adult.  It's awesome how intricate the details are.  The characters are well developed in this book... they're insecure, but they've got cause. 1)they're teenagers, and 2)they have pretty big shoes to fill. I wonder what happens to Nick and Lirael.  Ya never know! <br />Anxiously waiting for Abhorsen!
B000002I4S|5.0|Giant Steps was possibly the most consistently outstanding tenor solo statement since Sonny Rollins' Saxophone Colossus. Of course, Coltrane's own performance on Kind of Blue, just a month or two before, is now legendary, but he had shared the glory with soloists of a similar calibre, and furthermore the present recording contained nothing but his own compositions. Here his phenomenal vision and technique shone with spellbinding power, framed exquisitely by the sheer authority of a superb rhythm section.<br />The title tune features a huge, assured performance from Coltrane, with Art Taylor providing densely argued rhythmic support. Only Tommy Flanagan appears to struggle with this intensity, but treats it with both affection and mastery 23 years later with the superlative tribute Giant Steps: In Memory of John Coltrane (Enja, 1982). On &quot;Cousin Mary&quot; Paul Chambers is on tremendous form, playing generous, confident bass behind Coltrane's swelling tenor. Less well-known, bordering on the unreal, is &quot;Countdown&quot;, now more frequently recognised as a singular item in the jazz canon. It's blistering, exhausting and exhaustive, a swirling madness of harmonic and tonal exploration. Flanagan, more assured now, comps solidly behind Trane, helping him to build up to a final climax, in which contrary to convention, Trane states the theme. Rounding off the sound and accelerating the tempo almost imperceptibly, Paul Chambers enters seemingly without effort, helping to create an exhilarating tapestry reminiscent of Miles Davis' &quot;Tune Up&quot; on Cookin'. The rarely revisited &quot;Spiral&quot; has a wonderful, swinging pulse, and deserves to be better represented in subsequent musicians' tributes. &quot;Syeeda's Song Flute&quot; is a simple theme, tersely set up, demanding release. It provides the background for one of Trane's most eloquent and expressive solos on the album. Flanagan delivers, true to form, a solo of light, lucid transparency, not dissimilar in execution to the solos of the great Sonny Clark. &quot;Naima&quot; is the album's most emblematic piece, now firmly associated with John Coltrane as a defining composition - self-searching, built upon a melody so simple it can be reduced to two scales. This austerity, combined with a fervent inner zeal, are among the most distinctive characteristics of the Coltrane oeuvre. <br />Giant Steps ends with &quot;Mr P.C.&quot; (for the bassist Paul Chambers), a massive, swelling blues, lifted from its primal essentials to an ethereal hymn-like height with a riveting melodic solo.  The record has now been re-released with additional takes featuring Cedar Walton, Wyn Kelly, Jimmy Cobb and Lex Humphries. It's an essential purchase.
B000056K04|5.0|Everyday is my favorite CD.  However, I can't complain about it like everyone else is, by saying it's totally different from all the other DMB albums, just b/c I don't own any of the other albums...I'll get the others sometime, and then I might change my opinion, but right now, this is a great CD!
B000000Y1H|5.0|Brilliant Corners is remarkable for bringing together musicians who had established themselves as major jazzmen in their own right and yet gave everything on this date to make an album that from the outset would reflect Monk's peculiar musical world. Perhaps it is Monk's most enduring masterpiece.<br />The title piece is one of the single major works in the jazz canon. It proved so difficult to play that 25 separate cuts had to be spliced together to produce the final piece. Sonny Rollins was the tenor saxophonist on the date and leading guest musician. As a teenager, Rollins had rehearsed alongside Monk. His contribution to \\"Brilliant Corners\\" was devastating: he acquired a feel for the unusual structure of the piece -abrupt changes of tempo, bombast followed by bathos, sudden diabolical runs, jumps into double time- and became Monk's voice through a horn, while retaining the unmistakeable Rollins attack. And all this drama was held together by the polyrhythmic adaptability of Max Roach, who had played so magnificently with Rollins a few months earlier on Saxophone Colossus.<br />The rest of the album contains the eccentric blues \\"Ba-lue Bolivar Ba-lues-are\\" (which appears on numerous early 1960s discs, including Monk's Dream, Columbia, 1962), the first recording of \\"Pannonica\\", written for the wealthy jazz-lover Pannonica \\"Nica\\" de Koenigswarter, in whose New York apartment Charlie Parker had died the year before, \\"Bemsha Swing\\", first recorded by Monk in 1952 and on this occasion featuring Duke Ellington's chief trumpeter Clark Terry, and a solo reading of \\"I Surrender, Dear\\". This is an essential modern jazz album.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I saw the film yesterday and HAD to have the soundtrack today. The whole time I was watching the movie all I could see was hordes of fans dressing up and singing along with the film...such fun and opens up freedom in the heart...yes, Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love just like the movie portrays. The only disappointment for me (but not enought to give it 4 stars)on the CD was it was missing the wonderfully nutsy rendition of Like A Virgin...in fact I visited to see if there is a second CD with \\"more\\" music.
B00000I14Z|5.0|Ah Um is one of Charles Mingus's most richly textured albums, dense and dynamic all at once. It is almost as if the whole of the jazz tradition to that date, and some vision of its immediate future, were crammed into three-quarters of an hour. It is not as ambitious as The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady (1963) and still retains some measure of conventionality in the structures of some of its constituent pieces: introduction, ensemble statement of the theme, solos, development, recapitulation, closing statement.<br />Peculiar wails weave themselves in and out of ironic quotations from Ellington, from Mingus, from the blues, all cloaked in the enormity of the Mingus sound, thrust forward by rhythms and counter-rhythms tightly driven by Dannie Richmond. It contains the passionate, aching &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&quot;. An indispensable album.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I LOVE this movie.  I LOVE this soundtrack.  I have seen the movie twice now, and I must agree that people either love it or hate it, a fact which was proven when some people walked out after the revamp of &quot;Heroes&quot; (and shouting a few choice words in the process), and everyone who remained stayed glued to the screen up to the flashing of TRUTH, BEAUTY, FREEDOM, but above all LOVE.  What a powerful, moving expierence this film is.  There is only one dissappointment I have in the actual soundtrack... I want more! Where is the &quot;Smells like Teen Spirit&quot;, or &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;?  Where is the music from the Red Room scene and the very humorous Sound of Music?  Please, please, let there be an album titled &quot;MORE Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film MOULIN ROUGE!&quot;
B00000IL29|5.0|The players on Maiden Voyage are essentially those of the Miles Davis band - but how different from Miles' records it sounds and feels! In 1965, Herbie Hancock's leadership and vision were rapidly taking shape.<br />This album placed Hancock firmly in the company of the great jazz musicians. He had proved his mettle as an innovative and individual pianist on such excellent records as Wayne Shorter's Speak No Evil (Blue Note, 1964) and Miles' E.S.P. (Columbia, 1965), both recorded only months before. Now he led a group he knew intimately, and wrote enduring pieces for the date that were to become admired for decades to come.<br />The title track sets the tone for the whole record: subtle, measured, contemplative. It's the first solo opportunity for the perpetually underrated George Coleman, who displays virtuosity without arrogance, elegance without contrivance, depth of feeling without sentimentality.<br />Impeccably orchestrated pieces like &quot;Little One&quot; and the closing &quot;Dolphin Dance&quot; establish Herbie Hancock as the complete musician: inimitable pianist, creative composer, charismatic leader, supreme stylist.
B00001W9G0|4.0|Neither have ever looked more beautiful or been paired so perfectly...though, oddly enough, they would seem an extremely unlikely-pair.  In fact, no Hollywood pairing up to that point or since, has known greater anticipation.  You can't take your eyes off them when they are together.  And, more importantly, they surpass expectations...which is ALWAYS satisfying.  Barbra is truly wonderful in this film, which brought her a second (and last to date) Best Actress nomination.  Redford has to be given credit for taking the role because, in the end, the audience, and he himself realize what his character is truly made of.  The film falls short of a 5 star rating simply because of the editing, which leaves it choppy.  However, it certainly earns the other 4 stars because of the greatest pairing Hollywood has come-up with to date (except maybe Redford and Newman).
B00003CXE7|5.0|I have to admit that when &quot;Gladiator&quot; won Best Picture at the Academy Awards I kind of wondered wheter or not it had enough epic quality or even film quality to deserve the award.  The first time I saw it was several months earlier and I remember leaving thinking that it was a pretty good movie but without the notion that it would pick up any major awards.  Then a few months after the Oscars I watched it again and I found that it left me with just a good feeling.  Granted, all of the blood and guts marres that &quot;good feeling&quot; but the film ends really well and when looked at closely has a lot of substance.  Several people have told me that &quot;Traffic&quot; was a much better movie and deserved the Oscar but while &quot;Traffic&quot; did have much more relavence to modern issues and was factually correct, it just didn't leave me with the right feeling for its genre.  &quot;Gladiator&quot; is an enjoyable movie if you don't hold a cinematic grudge against it for being an &quot;action&quot; film.
B00004XONN|5.0|&quot;Kid A&quot; is brilliant.   Radiohead works their musical genius once again.  Radiohead evolves once again.  Instead of telling us about the sadness of the modern world like they did in OK Computer, they tell us about the sadness of the future.  Instead of speaking with guitars, they speak with sythesizers.     However, the most important thing remains: the music is visual, emotional, intelligent, and dark.     According to Thom Yorke, &quot;Kid A&quot; is a space opera, the sad tale of the first human clone in a bleak future.     According to Thom Yorke, &quot;Kid A&quot; is about the next step in human evolution and the end of the world.   From the opening dropping keyboard notes of &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; we are transported to the future, to the world of Kid A.  Clean, orderly, empty.  We witness the birth of the title character in the second track as Thom Yorke's heavily distorted voice seeps in and out between a tinkling mobile and soothing synthesizer as angelic voices sing gloriously.  The driving bass line and brass band of &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, where Kid A is frightened by his world, fade into the acoustic and dark &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot;, where Kid A denies existence.  We are soothed to sleep by the abnormally long guitar notes of &quot;Treefingers&quot; and then jolted awake by the abrasive twang and tribal drumming of &quot;Optimistic&quot;.  &quot;In Limbo&quot; is confusing as voices speak out of nowhere and an complex melody makes us feel as if we are falling.  Frenzy, dread, and awful realization dominate the quick dance beat of &quot;Idioteque&quot;  as Kid A sees an &quot;Ice age coming&quot;.  The haunting &quot;Morning Bell&quot; sounds like 2:00 am and dark blue-purple.  The album concludes with the tragic death of Kid A in the awe-inspiring, tear-inducing, most glorious of Radiohead songs &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; where a mighty church organ and ethereal harp, as well as more angelic voices, accompany some of the most heartbreaking and beautiful words Thom Yorke has ever penned.          People complained about Yorke's voice being muffled, mumble, and distant, which it was on this album.  Nonetheless, he still conveys emotion like few other singers have.  Bewilderment on &quot;National Anthem&quot;, panic on &quot;Idioteque&quot;, despair on &quot;Motion Picture&quot;, etc.  People complained about the lack of guitar.  Radiohead have been using primarily guitar for eight years, I'm glad I finally got to hear the keyboard take center stage.      This album is not as good as &quot;OK Computer&quot;(will anything after OKC ever be as good?), but still one of my favorites.  It is an escape from all other rock, a despairing hallucination, a warning to civiliation.  It discusses, among other things, individuality, science, and existence.      Radiohead has done on this album things never dreamt before.  Unique, innovative, experimental.  This is a great concept album that dabbles in both electronica and rock operas, an unlikely combination.    Steely Dan, surrender your stolen Grammy, it does not belong to you.    &quot;Kid A&quot; is brilliant.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Hannibal is probably the most underrated sequels I have ever seen. The reason being is that everyone expected to see a sequel, when all they really saw in this film was a movie that was totally unique and stand on its own. I think many of the people who saw this movie and didn't like it, were simply disappointed by their own shallow sense of expectation. This time round it is Hannibal's film, and that being said, of course it is going to be much darker than the first two films, which were essentially great crime thrillers. But Hannibal is more of a drama and character study into the mind of a man, a witty cultured, romantic, sophistocated man, who just happens to be a homicidal sociopath, and his obsession and love for a woman(Clarice) who admires and respects him, but can never return the love he feels for her. I was also surprised by the epic feel the movie carried with it as well, almost on a very grand scale. I guess you make an epic film with any any type of subject matter, you don't need it to take place over a long period of time, or have it be about some great historical leader, or even include a war or a famous sinking ship, as long as you have the right script(intriguing and original storyline), the right actors(the acting all around was first rate), and excellent directing(kudos to Ridley Scott who gives an epic feel to all his movies). This film is destined to be a classic.  If not than surely a cult classic.  But in my mind I will always hold this film in the same high regard as its predecessor.
1573226521|4.0|The book The Beach is better than the film version as it is much darker and leaves more to the imagination.  The Beach is about a guy called Richard who is travelling around Thailand when he comes across a man who talks about the perfect island. (paradise).  Not believing this man Richard goes to sleep and next morning wakes up to find a map stuck to his door and the man who had told him about it had killed himself.  Not wanting to go alone Richard asks the french couple from next door to go with him, which they do.  Once upon the island everything seems to be going fine until they find out that the island isn't all that it seems.  If you have seen th film and didn't like it then give the book a try as it is much better.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|To call this fabulous compilation of music from Baz Luhrmann's recent film, Moulin Rouge a soundtrack is stretching the definition.  It is a CD edited to make the charts as singles by various artists, not so much to showcase the sound track from the film because several production numbers from the film are missing.  Nevertheless, it presents in rapid succession, the significant vocal tracks by Bowie, Aguilera, Lil' Kim, et al., Bono, Ruffus Wainwright and Fatboy Slim ,whose &quot;Because We Can&quot; is far better than in the film itself.  What the CD does best is showcase Ewan McGregor's singing talent.  While some may fawn over Nicole Kidman's tweetie-bird soprano ability to warble high C, it is Ewan McGregor's ability to put over &quot;Your Song&quot; and his strong baritone harmony to &quot;Roxanne&quot; as well as several other familiar contemporary songs that make this CD worth buying.  For those who didn't know Ewan could sing, or have missed his vocal talents in films like Velvet Goldmine, A Life Less Ordinary, and Emma, Moulin Rouge gives the listener a stunning introduction to McGregor's impressive vocal ability.  As brilliant as the film is, the CD is just as wonderful and an addition to any collection.
0380788624|5.0|Cryptonomicon was the first Neal Stephenson book I read, a gift from my younger brother.  From the beginning, I was hooked.  It was sometimes a little technical (math concepts that went over my head) but it REALLY kept me interested.  I liked the fact that it was two stories, with the descendants of the WWII characters coming together as their ancestors did.  This book opened the door for me to other works by Neal Stephenson which I have also loved!
B000002KY8|5.0|Prince has managed to create best selling singles and tremendous controversy and roll them up into one.  This album is his showpiece where he really shows what he can do.  Only two singles from this album have actually lasted as pop classics, those two being the the sexy Little Red Corvette, and for awhile 1999.  Both of those songs deserved to last, as they were catchy, funky and creative.  The other 9 songs sound still sound good though, and Automatic and Let's Pretend We're Married are in my opinion some of Prince's best tracks yet.  The only song I don't like is Something In The Water (Does Not Compute), which isn't very catchy and Prince is trying to hard to prove his points.  Everything else is very good though, and it's no wonder that Amazon.com marked it as one of their essential recordings.  This album is great, and you will play it again and again.
0312119038|5.0|This is a disturbing personal account of the author's life as a Catholic nun in Britain, which she entered at age 17 and left 7 years later. The backdrop is the 60's, an era of changing values and the Vatican II Council. The relentless harshness of convent life is described in unsparing detail. It emerges as a life of drudgery and hardship, mindless fatalism, sexual frustration and aching loneliness. At the time she wrote this book, Armstrong appears to have been a practising Catholic (in contrast to later books like &quot;The History of God&quot; where she takes an agnostic position). She concludes by praising religious life and by saying that she has no regrets about the years she devoted to it.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Many people have complained about Carlos Santana selling out to mainstream.  Well, he did, but look at the results!  This disc is absolutely stunning.  Smooth was undoubtedly one of the biggest singles ever.  It was on my local radio stations playlist for about ten months, and crossed over many formats.  The next single was the smooth and laid back Maria Maria, which became another hit.  This track featured Wyclef Jean singing lush vocals, and the result is urban meets Spanish styles.  There is a wide range of guest artists on here: Lauryn Hill, Rob Thomas, Eric Clapton, Dave Matthews, Everlast, Wyclef Jean, Mana, Eagle Eye Cherry and Cee Lo.  All of them sound great on this disc, and their personal styles intertwine with Carlos's making for a rich and original sound.  There are several mini instrumental masterpieces on this album, most notably the catchy and danceable Africa Bamba.  There is definately a reason this was the number one album for so long.  Just pop this CD in your player and see why.  Carlos Santana is a musical genius, and hopefully he'll stay around for awhile.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge was one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time.  It is a very unusual movie, but very well done and very enjoyable.  Everything about it is amazing.  Ewan McGregor was awesome, and he did an amazing job singing and portraying emotions.  Nicole Kidman also did a great job, and her singing was very beautiful too.  I had bought the soundtrack before seeing the movie, so I knew that both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were very talented, but watching them sing was great still.  Ewan and Nicole had incredible chemistry and they made the love story so awesome. The story, set, and costumes were also incredible.  I recommend that anyone who sees this movie keeps an open mind, because it is very differnt, very fast paced, and very visually dizzying.  Also realize, that it is a musical.   It was a very well done movie and I hope that it gains the recognition and praise that it truly deserves.
B000001Y42|4.0|I've been a fan of Durst an Co. ever since this album was first released,and it is by far the best bizkit album.Heavy (...)and catchy as hell!The other two releases they have done in my opinion (stink)! as they seemed to have mellowed out a bit.From the opening track \\"Pollution\\" you know these guys are gonna rock like a whippet on speed.It only gets better from here on in folks,the classic \\"Counterfeit\\" starts with a whisper and ends with you having to change your underwear.Following on is another (great)tune,\\"Suck\\" which is catchier than scabies.This album is more likely to appeal to fans of Slipknot or Will Haven,cos' its got that rougher edge to it.
B000000W5L|5.0|Exile on Main Street is the greatest rock &amp; roll album of all time bar NONE.  This is not an opinion, this is a fact, just like 2 + 2 = 4 or the Earth is round.  You may choose to disagree, but you'd be wrong if you you did.  There are no better albums.  Anyone who knows anything will tell you, &quot;Exile's the best.&quot;
B00003CXDZ|5.0|There are no words to describe this film.  Having just coming back from seeing it, I am still somewhat in shock.  The entire first half of the film is literally zooms by in a blur of color and music.  Once the story gets going, you're already dazed by the intensity of it all.<br />My favorite part of the film was Ewan McGregor's voice.  Seriously, he can sing!  I never knew a guy could reach such high notes and still sound wonderful.  Nicole Kidman was just as great, and I enjoyed every song they sang together.  The mixture of music in the movie is so strange that it makes the film worthwhile.<br />Personally I love out of the ordinary movies, so I really loved Moulin Rouge.  Baz Luhrmann is a genius, and he really succeeded with this film.  So many summer movies are full of fluff and of no real emotional value.  If you're looking for a gem of a movie; if you're looking for a film that will make you laugh and cry at once, then go see Moulin Rouge right away.
B00003CXN4|4.0|Michael Douglas has produced a great movie about the intricate world of drugs and the violence that it causes in all walks of life. [...] Drug law enforcement creates tremendous moral and ethical problems. Douglas has portrayed it brillinatly.  Catherine Zeta Jones is as lovely as ever and acted very well. Douglas is a superb actor.  It is a captivating movie.
6300185729|3.0|My feeling is that &quot;Legal Eagles&quot; works better if thought of as a murder mystery rather than as a comedy. The movie begins with a birthday party that ends in a fire, killing a little girl's artist/father. Hardly a laughing matter. There is a secondary story line that plays off of the budding relationship between rival lawyers played by Redford and Winger, and it involves some mildly funny moments, but the main focus is always on missing paintings and, as things develop, murder victims. The laughs are chuckles, not belly laughs. &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; this isn't. The romance is tepid, too, but the acting is good and the mystery is involved enough to keep you interested. As a light murder mystery, this film works reasonably well. It's not memorable, but it's OK.
B00003CXDZ|2.0|I must admit I thought the premise of the film held promise, and after my wife had expressed interest, having read the Ansen review in NEWSWEEK, I thought, why not make a date of it?  <br />Fifteen dollars poorer, I can tell you why. Although I trust Ansen's eye, I now imagine him with a feather pillow for a hind.  Or perhaps he slept through the last half.  I must have said to myself twenty-five times, &quot;Oh, now, come on, do we really need this shot?&quot;  Of course, we did not, even if this thing does win awards for art direction.  It's a lush production with just the right amount of lustiness and lust, if only one could watch it at home, DVD remote in hand, finger on fast-forward.  In that manner one might more easily recall how smoothly lyrics originally heard from the mouths of Madonna, Elton John, and Paul McCartney are integrated with the storyline, which by itself seems cleverly obtuse for the sake of avoiding hiring a writer.<br />My wife liked this film much less than I, flatly declaring, &quot;there are parts that are bad.  Just plain bad.&quot;  Well, she's right, I believe, but I got a real kick out of the can-can scenes early on--the colors and textures are remarkably faithful to the dynamic images we all know of the Moulin Rouge--and there's a great lovers' exchange on a rooftop.  Again, however, I'm talking about action early on, that which overshadows the climax, if &quot;climax&quot; can mean or be analogous to shooting blanks.
B00005J6T1|3.0|THESE SONGS ARE TOO LONG!!!! Get the singles instead. &quot;Holiday&quot; is SIX MINUTES LONG, for Pete's Dragon!! And plus, the songs that AREN'T singles (that would be the songs on the album that aren't &quot;Holiday,&quot; &quot;Borderline,&quot; and &quot;Lucky Star&quot;) are just awful Awful AWFUL! (&quot;Burning Up&quot; has an electric guitar?? WHY?!?!??) Those singles, man, they're awesome though. Just too long. Three or four great songs, and about four lame-ohs. As a result, it's more consistent than any album Britney Spears ever made.
B00005B6C9|5.0|The boneyards of Branson and Vegas will have to wait a long time for the BeeGees to show up.  With four decades in the music business and counting, the enduring musical craftmanship of the brothers Gibb continues to be a contender in today's market.  This CD marks a return to their roots, though contemporary flavors nicely season their signature vocal harmonies.  <br />The title track is a standout, with a refreshing economy of production - mostly acoustic guitar with interwoven vocals.  The result is a multi-layered song carried by strong musicianship, and it's Grammy material.  The sound is familiar, yet fresh as tomorrow morning's coffee.  \\"Man in the Middle\\", a lament of Everyman, has a great percussion thread and spirited melody line, a nice surprise from Maurice Gibb.  And \\"Embrace\\" is compelling, with Robin Gibb's crystalline lead vocal, masterfully produced with an exhilarating tempo.    <br />Of the 12 tracks, only two - \\"Technicolor Dreams\\" and \\"Loose Talk Costs Lives\\" --  are slightly off, and seem to belong in a different collection.  Expect to hear familiar elements of the BeeGees' art, which they continue to integrate into a body of work bearing witness to timeless talent that refuses to be pigeonholed.  Your kids may lift this CD from your collection, so you might as well buy them one of their own.
0425179877|4.0|I loved this book, and if you like well-written, illuminating stories about the space-race, you will too.  It sheds some light on the current state of NASA today.
B00000ILDE|5.0|It's great. You'll love it. It has everything like horror, terror and action never goes down. The special edition has 17 minutes of restored footage. The best film in &quot;Alien&quot; series. And also the best film in sci-fi fantasy. All the Alien fans, like me must have it.
079213690X|5.0|Braveheart is one of my most favorite films. It stars Mel Gibson in 12th Century Scotland fighting a gruling war with the English. Gibson portrays William Wallace, a hero for his country, but ultimately wants peace for his country, who fights bravely for Scotland in many Gory battles where he suffers personal losses as well as injury to himself. There is not much i can say about Braveheart, because most people know how good it is. I would recommed this movie to anyone who likes action mixed with drama and suspense at times.
B00000IMCU|5.0|The claustrophobia in this film is genuinely horrifying. Not only are the remaining humans holed up and slowly suffocating. But even if they were to escape, more of the same would await them wherever they went.This setting is idyll for what George Romero brings to the table: a gory and hilarious summing up of consumer culture,a society charged with fear, and the instinct for self-preservation. But all of the philisophical stuff aside, i don't know of too many other films that can move so effortlessly from terror to side-splitting comedy.
B000005AYM|5.0|Just to tell you all this album are one of those albums you will never get tired of. It is truly inspiring,wonderful jazz/hiphop/r'n'b mixed into one. She brings extremely well on this album. This is real quality r'n'b music. Everytime I hear it I get this old feeling I used to have as a child,and what a wonderful feeling it is!!Forget what you hear on the radio like Destiny's Child and Sisqo,this stuff right here is the real r'n'b. I played this album front to back,every song is wonderful. I have not heard her new album but I have heard her single &quot;Didn't Cha Know&quot;,which gave that old feeling back again.Buy this album!! :o)
B00005B36H|5.0|this is definitly the coolest album tool has released with the exeption of aenema, of course. It  seems as if they keep getting better and better with each new album...there so creative in putting words and notes together, definetly one of a kind. hard core fan till the end...
0767903862|4.0|Bryson made his name with &quot;The Lost Continent&quot;, possibly the funniest grouchy travel book ever written.  All his books since then have been worth reading, though they vary in quality: &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; was unusually thoughtful (and very good), but by and large he became famous as the champion of the cutting remark and the unkind anecdote.<br />&quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; shows him mellowing a little.  He still has a penchant for visiting odd things and places, and bumping into strange people -- giant earthworms, a town called Tittybong, and the proprietor of the Lambing Flat museum all come to mind -- but he's nice about them.  It's an odd thing to say if you're used to reading Bryson, but this book is a traditional travelogue.<br />It's still entertaining.  Bryson is a good writer, and there is so much in Australia to write about -- aborigines, myxomatosis, Ayers Rock, the Great Barrier Reef, and a huge array of lethal wildlife, some of which he comes a little too close to for comfort.  He does a good job of summing up history and adding a dollop of what's going on today, and he conveys a good sense of place.  Occasionally the old caustic note comes through again, when he recounts the story of a self-important early Australian administrator, or has a hard time finding decent food in Canberra, but it's no longer the dominant note in the book.<br />I can still recommend this as a fine travel book.  Classic Bryson it isn't, though; so if you're a Bryson fan you may be a little disappointed.
B00003CXN4|2.0|It's too bad this movie was done by the same guy that did Erin Brokovich, because it contained a lot of the same Hollywood moralizing, which is different to TV evangalist moralizing in content alone.<br />That said, Traffic was a good movie - specifically, Del Toro, who was fantastic, but I can't believe some of the dialogue in this movie.<br />First of all, the 10 second blurb by the kid from &quot;That 70's Show&quot; while he was in the car with Michael Douglas was ridiculous. The argument displayed is that drug dealers are so rampant in the ghettoes because all the white kids come into them and ask for drugs? To further confuse the issue, he maintains that if 1000 black people came into white neighborhoods and wanted to buy drugs, all the white kids would be drug dealers instead of going to law school. I think that's one of the grossest falsehoods about drugs in America today, and further perpetuates the so-called victims of the drug dealing industry, blame it on &quot;the man.&quot; And the rant in general sounded like it was written by a rich liberal who has never stepped foot in a ghetto in his life. <br />Along the same lines, it was also incredibly political to try and make the argument that, drugs should be legal, but we should spend the same anti-drug campaign tax money on drug treatment. Again, let's coddle more &quot;victims&quot; at the expense of the tax payer, whether he likes it or not.<br />They made good arguments about why drugs should be legal (the hypocrisy of legalizing other drugs like alcohol but not other substances is good, the idea that the cops are working for dealers too, and of course all the deaths involved) and should have kept it at that. <br />Personally, I think this movie tried to say more than it should have. If it was going to take the stance of legalizing drugs, it should have done that. When you try to show every facet of something like drugs, you run into trouble. The whole Michael Douglass' daughter thing was unnecessary, except to show that most kids experiment with drugs, even rich kids. It was unnecessary to make her a free-base addict who gets pimped out by the &quot;righteous ghetto victims.&quot; <br />So, it was a good movie with strong performances by most of the cast, with the exception of Michael Douglas and his trashy daughter. The script was pretty inventive, with the exception of the two situations I mentioned already, which were very PC and annoying. I give this movie 2 stars, for nothing else but Del Toro's performance.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Where has she been.  It's so nice to know that there are still real artists out there that don't find it necessary to explot women, down black men, insult peoples intelligence or curse in every other stanza.  She has restored my faith in music.  This is truly a work of Art.  I hope she continues she is extremely talanted and I hope she's around for a long long time.
B00005B36H|5.0|How can you deny that this is a great album?  You may say it is not as good as Aenima, which I agree to, but that does not mean it is not a great album.  Let's just say this album is still 5/5 stars, but Aenima was 10/5.
B00003CXP1|5.0|A dramatic color turn around from his first film Pi, Darren Aronofsky has found a new way to toy with our emotions and make me smile with the ultimate &quot;scared straight&quot; film.  This film is by far the best film I have seen all year with a large dramatic contrast from beginning to end.  Darren and Hubert Selby Jr.(the writer of the book) make you fall in love with the characters in the beginning making you leave the movie shaking and in absolute shock like you best friend or puppy has died.  <br />This film gets a definate A+ in direction and an A++ for Mathew Libitiques work in cinematography.  The fast paced cuts, fantabulious character interaction, and electronic joy ride score of music makes this movie total eye candy and an emotional roller coaster.<br />Other credits I would like to not is Ellen Burnstyne's performance as &quot;Sarah Goldfarb&quot;.  Although, she has not been in a major motion picture since the 1970s she once again astonishes audiences with what I would believe to be the best creative dramatic contrast in characterization in modern film.  <br />On another acting note, Marlen Waynes also takes us all by surpass by a great dramatic role in contrast to his norm of comedy.  I like you better in the dramatic style stick with it!<br />In summation, I recommend this film to anyone with a brain to be toyed with.  This is the definite must see of this year, although it probably is not for the faint of heart...<br />-The Justin B. Scale of Overcriticalness

B000002V0Q|3.0|Megadeth took a step back with this CD,but they still made a solid record that it worth the purchace price.This CD has one of the best songs Megadeth has ever written in &quot;Skin O'My Teeth&quot; and a few others that will remind you of Megadeths Glory days.It does not measure up to previous efforts Like &quot;Peace Sells...But whos Buying&quot; or &quot;Rust in peace&quot; but it has enough good songs to earn 3  stars from me.
B00005BL2A|3.0|I bought this the day it was released and held off on the review until I had ample time to listen.  Having said that, it isn't my favorite Depeche Mode for sure.  I, like many others, hold high expectations from this cutting edge group.  Therefore, anything less than perfect, I suppose is a bit of a let down.  It isn't really the pace that's the problem.  I have always enjoyed their slower tracks.  The infusion of more guitar, that's fine. Something, maybe in the delivery wasn't emotional enough for me, yet rather forced at times.  There are moments though, I liked &quot;Shine,&quot; which is about as old school DM as it gets here, with a catchy bridge and chorus.  Also &quot;Freelove&quot; is good, with a smooth melody and groove.  I like &quot;The Dead of Night&quot; with its industrial beat and distorted guitar riffs, which will probably either be loved or hated.  &quot;When The Body Speaks&quot; is quite pretty but I think would've been better minus the low bass or drum track that plagues it...The so-so tracks are the snappy &quot;Dream On,&quot; with the half sung half spoken lyrics and sparse synths, the house style of &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; (a little played), &quot;I Am You,&quot; is fair with a floating reggae-eque bass line and the closer &quot;GoodNight Lovers&quot; is again, not bad.  Usually, Martin Gore's contributions are my favorite, here, the opposite.  I didn't care for &quot;Comatose&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot; is bad.  On a more positive note, the production overall is good, the lyrics are honest and introspective, and the inside CD sleeve is glossy and slick.  Exciter could've been worse, then again, it could've been better!
B00003CXDZ|4.0|The professional reviews I read all said you will either love or hate this movie.  I maintain that you can do both.  It was a lot like a roller coaster ride.  My friends and I screamed the whole way through, then said, &quot;That was great!  Let's do it again!&quot;.<br />The barrage of images, swooping camera work and editing, and painful musical anachronisms is an assault on the senses, but well worth sorting out in the quiet night afterwards.  Not recommended for pregnant women or people with hearth conditions ;-)
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool took a very different turn with this album.<br />The album teaters on the edge of perfection.  Maybe its a little too perfect.  The music on this album seems to have ascended to the point that it is no longer music.<br />Should be taken in in its entirety.  Listen to the entire album all the way through.  After you have done so, you might want to put on some music to contrast this album.<br />The album is very complicated and very hard to swallow.<br />Keep a very open mind.
0399146253|4.0|I have read all of the Scarpetta series, and I can honestly say that this book gave me and any of her other fans an insight to how Kay thinks and functions. We have never been able to understand her distance to sister and mother until now. It's nice to have a peek into her past and find out just how Kay ticks. I hope that her character continues to evolve and use her past to her advantage, and have her interaction with her niece Lucy mature. I can't wait to read her next adventure and see where she'll be in the future. Will she leave Virginia, or use it as a home base, and what about Marino, how will he tie into the next phase of the Last Precinct?

B000002HMH|1.0|Metallica has not made a good albumn since 1988 and this record gives me no indication things will change any time soon.There is not one good song on this entire CD.Its just not the Metallica I grew up with.I understand Bands evolve over the years but these guys have taken it a bit too far.Metallica used to belong to us....now they belong to them....Wht more can I say...Its over...Its been over for years..It is time for Metallispears to hang it up.
B000002BQK|3.0|Far and away her weakest album to date, BUTTERFLY was the continuation of Carey's attempt to incorporate hip-hop and r&amp;b into her mostly pop sound.  While the mid to uptempo tracks here are quite good, the ballads are what bring this record down.  The title track is serviceable, but is basically a remake of her previous hit 'Hero'.  'My All', though revered by some, is her worst ballad since 'I Don't Wanna Cry', and the music surrounding the song is just as depressing as that of said record.  This album's remake, of Prince's 'The Beautiful Ones', is downright bad, and finds her and guests Dru Hill completely out of their element.  On a more positive note, members of Bone Thugs-In-Harmony provide distinctively fresh vocal work on 'Breakdown', and 'The Roof' is another very decent attempt at credible hip-hop beats.  Ultimately, though, even those few bright spots can't save what is overall a very dull record.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This movie is the greatest movie ever made, and for a superman fan like me, its a must buy. The film is directed with perfection and the special effects are superb, much better than later superman films. What makes this film different compared to most superhero films is that the movie contains emotion as well as nicely staged sequences, the first transformation of superman couldnt have been better at the helicopter scene. The acting was excellent, Christoper reeve couldnt have been replaced, and turned out to be a major aspect of the movie. The soundtrack was brilliant! John Williams composed the perfect tune to cohere with the superman feeling, and throughout the movie the music moves nicely with the sequences. However, mistakes were made and the acting of the cast saved any questioning of these mistakes, they include that Jor-el was wearing his rolex watch while placing the green crystal on the babies craft, Clark not being noticed when he jumps out the window, when the world is turned back jimmy turns up at a time he also should've turned up when superman was mourning lois's death, when superman transorms for the first time a full crowd doesnt notice him at the helicopter stage, when superman is told with his super speed he wouldnt catch the rockets, he is in the water for at least 5mins, when he's saved he catchs one of them but not both, it would've taken him the same time he was in the water to catch the other rocket. This might also mean that luthers judgement of supermans superspeed was wrong. The uncut scenes are worthy, although there is one uncut scene that is not added, this is when miss tesparker is dropped in the lion pitt and superman saves her. The three documentaries are good, especially when they show how superman flew. Overall a great epic! Well done Superman crew.
B00003CXQX|5.0|&quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot; is not your average Disney animated movie.  It's not peppered with big musical numbers, its animation doesn't employ the latest in cutting-edge computer technology, and there is no in-your-face-marketing campaign.  Instead, you're treated to a clever script, snappy dialogue, and memorable characters.  The plot is simple: Emperor Kuzco gets turned into a llama by his evil advisor, Yzma, and tries to find the potion that will turn him back into a human.  But the movie is so much more than that--there are also important lessons about friendship and kindness.  I think many will be surprised by the movie's moral message.  On his journey, Kuzco gets a helping hand by Pacha, a local peasant he once treated badly as Emperor (in fact, he treated ALL the peasants badly).  But despite this, Pacha shows him love and kindness in hopes of reforming his selfish ways.  Does he succeed?  You'll have to watch the movie.  The bottom line: this movie will keep both kids and adults in stitches from start to finish!  And you may even learn a lesson or two. :)
B000059MEK|4.0|I kinda bought this album on a whim, which i dont normally do, and am glad I did so. Discovery turned out to be exactly what my CD collection needed, something a little different, fun, up-beat, and unique. My favorites are &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; for its free-for-all funk, and &quot;Something about Us&quot; because of it's smooth R&amp;B groove, and &quot;Face to Face&quot; with a little 80's retro funk. Daft Punk's style seems to be an ingenious blend of disco, house, funk and electronica. It can always put me in a good mood! I love it!
0140288503|4.0|This book was very well researched and well written.  I especially liked how the author chose to explain the battle through the eyes of those who participated in it, not only from the American side but the Somali side as well.  It gave the battle a very balanced picture that neither endorses the American side nor criticizes it, but rather explains the facts as seen through the participants of both sides and gives the reader the chance to reach his own conclusions.  It is like journalistic writing should be; objective in its treatment of the subject and yet flowing enough to read like a good war novel.
B00005J6T0|5.0|The first step in her attempt to be taken as more than just a boy-toy dance siren, TRUE BLUE is Madonna's first sign of the greatness she could achieve on a creative and artistic level. Opening with the timely 'Papa Don't Preach', this is the first time Madonna addresses issues of social relevance.  The album also houses arguably her greatest achievement, the out-of-left field ballad 'Live To Tell', featuring the first glimpse of what she could accomplish with her vocal work.  Now mind you, the dance tunes do come fast and furious, particularly 'Open Your Heart' and 'White Heat'.  And she even dips into ' 60s girl group harmonies with the bouncy title track.  With no filler in sight, this is essential listening for any Madonna fan and fans of '80s music in general.
B00005JIZA|5.0|If you are even remotely interested in buying this album, i feel that all of these glowing reviews speak volumes- this is truly an artist that is just beginning to make his mark, and the sooner you hear him the sooner youll be able to say &quot;i was digging on him way back when&quot; :).  Room For Squares takes a handful of his great songs, and fleshes them out into one hell of an album- his voice, lyrics and guitar work are complex yet simple, playful yet tight...there really isnt a bad song on this album, or even one you would skip over- just different tunes for different moods.  i cannot reccomend it enough...BUY THIS ALBUM!
0783107986|5.0|This is the penultimate video history of the war.<br />The VHS series is quite good, but am still waiting for DVD format. It is available in Europe, but not North America.
B00003CXN3|3.0|This was a decent film but I failed to see the reason behind why it got so much acclaim.  It is a great depiction of the drug war situation, yes.  But I didn't find the overall plot very compelling and the film itself isn't really very entertaining.  Traffic is a great movie for showing the viewer &quot;this is the way things are&quot; (from a totally pessimistic point of view) but when it comes to powerful storytelling, it lacks.  One reason for this is the fact that there are many stories all going on at once, and the characters in each of these stories have their own conflicts to resolve.  But the film shifts its attention from one to the other much too often and it seems that none of them have enough time or description to really set in with the viewer.  It seems more like each one is given a cursory, impersonal overview which at the end doesn't really leave any lasting effect on the audience.  The cast did a fine job with their roles, but none of them really had to do much to challenge or showcase their utmost abilities as performers.  Most of the conflicts aren't truly resolved at the end, but the film seems very preachy throughout its course on how pointless the war on drugs is.  This is what seems like the overall message.  Although Traffic comes out to be a good look into a contemporary problem that our society faces, it cannot stand on its own as a great work of motion picture storytelling.  When it comes down to it, Traffic simply isn't a very entertaining or involving film.
0679879269|5.0|This book is one of the best I have ever read. And I am not just glamorizing it for the sake of something to do. I have read many a story in my so far eighteen years of life and this ranks right up there with the best of them. The other two in this series were remarakable as well. The Subtle Knife left me hungering, begging for more. And I was rewarded in this end to an amazing trilogy. <br />Although it claims to be, I feel that this is not a children's book. Not in the sense of Dr. Seuss or even the Hardy Boys. There is more substance and depth to this story then in a whole slew of Hardy Boy Mysteries. The book does have certain parts of anti-religion, but we must remember that this is a story. I myself am a christian, and though I found certain parts made me do a double take, overall I felt that it was not offensive. It is fiction, and a person's religious views should not discourage them from reading this book. The plot is absorbing and the characters leave a lasting impression. I have re-read this book twice already, done a report on it for a 12th grade english assignment and plan to read it again to pass the summer time. Will and Lyra have forever been engrained into my mind. The bitter-sweet ending moved me to tears. It was not at all what I expected, but as I saw them begin to fall in love I soon reliased that something had to give. The ending could not just end with sap and a sunset. If it did I would have been very  upset. The world is not as simple and cliched as that. I  am an unpublished free lanced writer and I know how hard it can  be not to put a mushy gushy finish at the end of a story. The pull can be very strong. I am greatful that Pullman is the talented writer that he is and gave us a work that may leave us sad and heart broken but one that did not sell itself short. And as for Will and Lyra being to young to fall in love I just have to say, they never had the chance to be young. Think about it, what other twelve year olds do you know of have had the fate of humaity rest on their shoulders? Or had to journey into the land of the dead and fight the army of the End Time? They may be only children, but they underwent more then anyone, young or old should ever have to go through in a lifetime. And love know's no boundaries, it just happens. Their relationship was short lived but sweet and tragically sad. <br />In conclusion I encourage you to read this book, not for all it's awards, and good reviews. But because it is something worth taking the time to read. You will not be dissapointed.
B00003CXMG|1.0|I am 38 and watched this movie with my husband and our 3 teenage children.  None of us liked this movie.  The story was lame, predictable, stereotypical.  The main character was a homely boy, without charm, who lost his virginity to 3 pretty girls all at once and then yelled at them in the morning because they wanted him to take their laundry out.  The rock &quot;stars&quot; lacked charisma.  As for the new &quot;it&quot; girl, Kate Hudson.  Hmm... She is attractive, not a beauty and does not have the adorable spark that her mother, Goldie Hawn had.  Not even close.  This film didn't even have good music!
0446310786|1.0|Looking for a sappy, cliched, novel to read? One predictable as most young-adult books and more degrading than harlequin romances? Well, To Kill a Mockingbird is your book.  In this novel, all Harper Lee gives as a theme is &quot;life isn't fair.&quot;   I think most of us couold have figured that out without a book that should have started where the first &quot;part&quot; ended.  Ms. Lee merely portrays a terrible, biased, southern society that seemingly places its main goal on ruining everyone elses life.  Her female characters are flat, simple-minded women.  Wether or not this is due to its setting is irrelevant.  Lee places guilt on a group of people instead of individuals (the Ewells) as it should be.  Thank God Ms. Lee only wrote this book; surely her next would degrade society even further.  I'm sure it too would be deemed a classic as long as it dealt with politically correct subjects that are far too worn out to remain interesting.
B0000028RR|5.0|this album is as explosive as the Atomic Bomb.  They never equalled its fury.  Angry, Hate-Ridden and Mind Blowing!  I'm sad to see them go, at least they put out there best album first.  They never equalled it.  Perfect
B000059XYL|4.0|Piper Perabo plays Violet, the nice girl from Jersey who moves to NYC to try to make it big as a songwriter. She lands a job as a \\"coyote\\" to support herself while she gets established, singing and dancing in a wild (wild, but still basically PG-13) bar. During her personal voyage of self-discovery and growth, she meets a guy (Adam Garcia) and has various adventures, and seeks to ultimately prevail over the shyness she must conquer, to reach her goals.<br />As a guy, I rented this for predictable reasons. Ohhh, those previews... MERCY!!! However, this really is not a simple babefest in any way. It really is mostly about Violet's personal odyssey to overcome her fears and achieve her dreams. Be warned that although it is certainly sweet, it doesn't exactly stick to your ribs. The dialog is monumentally uninspired, and probably more cliche-ridden than any movie I've seen since... ummm.. well, it's in a different genre, but I'd have to mention \\"Bats.\\"  Come on, writers! You could have done better than that. Anyway, Violet's journey is sort of a cross between the stories of Olivia Newton-John's character in \\"Grease\\" and Tom Cruise's character in \\"Cocktail.\\" That sounds freaky, but you'll see what I mean. Piper Perabo's Violet reminds me of a sort of cross between a waifish Amanda Peet and a nineties version of Audrey Hepburn, living out the story of a latter-day Minnie Pearl... There's a really fun soundtrack, which is always a plus... Also, the whole movie features a cornucopia of suspiciously well-toned midriffs -- I can just imagine all the girls in the film doing sit-up and \\"crunch\\" marathons between takes.<br />Watch for Bud Cort, who played Harold in the cult favorite \\"Harold and Maude!\\" He plays the guy in the coffee shop, named Romero, who first introduces Violet to the other \\"coyotes,\\" and who gives her a free slice of pie to cheer her up.<br />Supporting actors in general do a good job with the lines they're given. Maria Bello plays up her part well, as the brassy, tough-as-nails Lil, who owns the bar, and who becomes Violet's friend. Izabella Miko is somehow simultaneously babyishly cute, and devilish-looking, as Cammie.  Tyra Banks is gorgeous, of course, and actually a pretty good actress, I thought.  Bridget Moynahan is terrific as Rachel, the ferocious grrrrl dancer with a heart of gold -- she has such a strong presence it might get in her way, looking for future roles. Think of Linda Hamilton from the second Terminator movie, crossed with the Terminator himself, and you'll get a sense of what her character is like... John Goodman and Adam Garcia are great too -- heck, everyone does a good job, it's just that the lines are so ....<br />Basically, this movie is a lot of fun, and it has an uplifting message, especially for younger viewers. If you want crackling dialogue, see \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" -- if you want a sweet movie that happens to have a lot of major babes in it, see \\"Coyote Ugly.\\" Two thumbs up.
B000001EXR|5.0|I will simply say that this CD is excellent.  I just don't get why people keep putting this down and saying things like &quot;If you're a TRUE Kiss fan, you'll avoid this one.&quot; Yeah, Right!  If you're a true fan, you'll buy everything the band has released and enjoy it!  Carnival of Souls is the best in my opion, because it shows that Kiss had changed, it put behind the numb-skulled musical direction of Love Gun and Destroyer only to move the band forward.  I like the ballads too, &quot;I will be there&quot; is even more beautiful than &quot;Under the Rose&quot;, &quot;Everytime I Look at you&quot;, and &quot;Forever&quot; combined.  The grungy metal tracks are great too, i can't help but find myself headbanging to &quot;Master and Slave.&quot;  So like I say in my other reviews, if you can except change and listen to music that doesn't all sound the same then buy COS.  If you are too stubborn to listen to anything that doesn't sound like &quot;Rock n' Roll Alnight&quot; then buy another Best Of collection.
B00005B36H|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this album, because Aenima (their last album) was released in '96 and bands can change a lot in five years (Metallica anyone?). After listening to it, I can say that the music of Tool hasn't changed much since their last album. Anyone who liked Aenima should enjoy this recording nearly as much, if not more. The music style on Lateralus is very similar to Aenima. It's still deep and dark as ever (although the album's cover art might seem to suggest otherwise). Justin's bass is still heavy and ominous, Maynard can still hold a note for 20 seconds without faltering, Adam still throws down killer guitar solos, and Danny still tears it up on the drums. However, this album is slightly more mellow than their last. There's still a decent share of intense songs (The Grudge, Parabola, Triad), but none of them quite make it to the caliber of 46 &amp; 2 or Eulogy. Not to say that the mellower songs (Parabol, Schism, Reflection) aren't equally great; I think it's a bonus that the quartet throws in a good mix of both. This album's also got a lot more bass emphasis than any of its predecessors. On Lateralus, Justin's bass lines carry many of the songs (if you've heard Schism on the radio, you'll know what I'm talking about). In the past, especially on Opiate and Undertow, Adam's guitar riffs dominated many of the songs. Pretty cool how they give Justin a chance to shine here. Overall, this is the best new metal album I've heard since Disturbed's 'The Sickness'. I would recommend it to you if you even remotely like Tool, or even if you simply enjoy good industrial metal. These guys were long overdue for an album, but if their next one promises to be just as good, I'm willing to wait another five years for it.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|This movie is one of the worst you'll ever see.  Unless you love musicals at any cost, this will not only put you to sleep...but you'll have a horrible hangover when you wake up to leave the theater.  The awful singing is only the start...but the pathetic close-ups throughout the film make it almost unbearable to watch.  You keep wanting to stretch your neck back to get some perspective.  The story is pure cliche...right out the butt.  Some silly courtesan finds real love and no longer wants to shell it out for money.  Etc etc.  Nicole Kidman's acting is really bad, as well.  Ewan McGregor is fine, but the role he's given...well...it leaves something to be desired.  The film is banking on the hype created by the Cruise-Kidman divorce along with the prostitute outfits of the Aguilera/Mya/Lil' Kim video.  Blech.
014028009X|3.0|If you grew up on Judy Blume, and have graduated to Sex and the City, you'll find this book very familiar. There's nothing new here, though.
B000002LE6|5.0|Lovesexy is perhaps Prince's greatest cd ever. In this album, he takes the listener on a spiritual journey with God and sex, without sounding condescending or preaching. The listening experience is smooth and funky. There are nine tracks on the album, but Prince put them all into one track (that lasts 45 minutes with all 9 songs) because he didn't want people to skip tracks while he was listening, but rather hear the album as a whole. I don't mind that at all, its great to listen to the album the whole way through.<br />Highlights on the album include Alphabet St., a funky little number that will keep you singing and dancing. Dance On, which will have you doing just what the title implies. Lovesexy which is perhaps my fave track, beautiful song. When 2 R In Love which is a classic Prince ballad. And more.<br />This is a must have for any fan of music. Lovesexy takes you on a musical journey through God and sex, and does it very well. This is one of the best albums I've ever heard, it is often overlooked by critics but it is one of his best, most solid albums ever.
B00005B5L4|5.0|Everyone already knows what an incredible album &quot;Rumours&quot; is, so there's no need to rehash that. However, the new DVD-Audio version of this classic album changes everything you remember about this album. The album has been remixed so that the vocals are more up front. Most songs sound more crisp and clear than they ever have before. &quot;Don't Stop&quot; is the only song that loses something here. &quot;Oh Daddy&quot; on the other hand benefits greatly because of this, Stevie and Lindsey's backing vocals can be heard crystal clear. &quot;Never Going Back Again&quot; sounds totally different as a guitar part previously buried in the mix has been brought forward. &quot;Songbird&quot; has you feeling as if you are right alongside Christine as she plays it. &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot; sounds more jaunty than before. The end of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; is more haunting and creepy than anything you remember. The greatest thing, however, about this new re-issue is the inclusion of &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, dropped at the time of the albums original release, it's back and better than ever. Also included on this disc are each members comments of each track. On the &quot;making of&quot; portion you get to hear demos of certain tracks (&quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; and &quot;The Chain&quot;). You also get outtake photo montages from the original photo sessions. You've loved the album all these years, but hearing this new DVD version it will be like hearing the album all over again for the first time!!! A nice companion piece to the &quot;Classic Albums ~ Rumours&quot; DVD.
B000000W94|2.0|I am a Gary Moore freak. I loved his stuff with Thin Lizzy and his 80's Solo Rock stuff and his blues records like &quot;After Hours&quot;, &quot;Still Got the Blues&quot; and &quot;Blues Alive.&quot; But, this &quot;Blues for Greeny&quot; thing reeks! It sounds like it was recorded in his bathroom or maybe over the phone! And the songs are as weak as it gets. This one will find its way to the pawn shop quickly!
B000059HAI|4.0|&quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; has been re-released on VHS and DVD to capitalize on the opening of Michael Bay's newest film treatment of the events of December 7th, 1941. This leaves it wide open for comparisons to &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; while also showing the vast contrasts of the movie-making and storytelling techniques of the past and the present. I'm not too keen on war movies, at least not the ones long ago which seem to be made for war veterans alone, but this one is not that bad. It is a bit tedious at times, but not a failure. <br />The movie sticks solely with historical events, choosing to keep any ficticious plotlines for another film. It's a joint collaboration between the American and Japanese filmmakers in order to get everything just right in terms of accuracy, and it succeeds. The Japanese are shown making the plans to attack the United States where they are most vulnerable, while also keeping US government officials at bay with talks of negotiation and peace. It wastes no time in letting us know that Pearl Harbor is the place for the attack, and from that point on, the Japanese make their unsighted journey across the Pacific for the legendary &quot;day of infamy.&quot; <br />On the opposite side of the Pacific, the United States is constantly in a frenzy, as we cross-cut between scenes at Pearl Harbor before the attack and Washington D.C., where various government officials run frantically around trying the decode Japanese messages intercepted on machinery that makes today's desktop computers look like pocket calculators. Once they start realizing that Japan is up to something, they take their findings, from translated messages to their own theories, to those in charge of making commands. <br />Of course, no one believes until it is too late that something could be brewing in the Pacific. As the Japanese close in, things begin to get faster as planes take off from carriers and the first intercepts of Honolulu radio are heard in their cockpits. The bombs start exploding, the ships start burning, and everyone comes to realize just what a mistake they made in not listening to the warnings. <br />Now, everyone has been comparing the way in which &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; was concocted to the creation of &quot;Titanic;&quot; this is in terms of movie-making. In terms of what actually happened historically, the story of &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; can also be compared to the Titanic tragedy. The Titanic sank because warnings of ice and dangerous seas were ignored repeatedly. It's the same case with the Pearl Harbor bombing: American officials chose to wave off the signs as mere fiction or coincidence (at one point, as the Japanese planes are flying towards Hawaii, one official shrugs them off as B-17 planes flying in from training). And just as the sinking of the Titanic was a great tragedy for many, so was the devastation of Pearl Harbor, which led American to declare war on Japan. <br />The attack portion of this movie does leave a bit to be desired, and perhaps this is because I'm a child of the technological era, where special effects do a lot of storytelling these days. This sequence, when put into the same arena as the effects-driven attack portion of &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; pales in comparison. &quot;Tora!&quot; is mostly comprised of aerial shots of the attack, and the effects are really cheesy, just what you'd expect from a war movie of the past. &quot;Pearl&quot; has more technology to toy with, and certainly makes good use of it, pumping the scenes full of adrenaline and pulse-pounding action to blow you away. <br />But still, &quot;Tora!&quot; wins over. The history involved in its unfolding of events is superb, even if a bit long. It brings out the inevitable comparisons to the latest Pearl Harbor treatment, while also making itself known as a landmark historical film.
0060392886|5.0|First I have to say, I am not an avid Motley Crue fan but the appeal of what these guys had to say was worth the purchase. I thought buying the book would have stories of groupie sex and mass drinking and there is plenty of that mentioned in the book. However, reading the book I felt as if they were opening up to me in this book and that I actually got to know them personally. The premiss is all band members give there views and thoughts from the beginning of Motley Crue even pre Motley days and that goes to the very end which is present. By the end of the book you really get a feel of how each of their personalitie's are. I have great admiration for Nikki Sixx after the book. Like I said, I never was familiar with the band but I have to say Nikki Sixx is a talented person who in the end just wanted to have something to call his own including a family. The book is an upclose story that is told about there lives on the stage and outside the stage as well as dealing with success. Get the book and in the end of the book you'll appreciate what matters most in the world not money, fame, or success but the people closest to you. Enjoy
0671024256|5.0|Several things in this work caught my attention.  <br />1) Stephen King is funny: he could've easily been a humour author and done just as well. 2) He doesn't believe in plot. Instead, he place real-to-life people in strange circumstances and let's the story unfold. 3) He opened my eyes to theme like no one else has.<br />The first part of the book are parts of his life that he believes shaped him as a writer.  The success story of it all is amazing and you see just how different a life Mr. King could've lived had his wife not dug through the trash (get the book, the story is great). <br />In the 2nd part he gives his views on writing.  These are priceless.  Some of the stuff you've probably read before but King legitimizes it: he tells why he believes that.<br />I briefly considered giving the book 4 stars because King believes that the genius writers are born not made.  But, I decided not to because its an opinion that doesn't affect the real content of the book or his approach to teaching.<br />I'll probably read this several times as I continue my writing.
0790734850|5.0|I usually dont like these types of films but this one is a purely captivating film. The story is complicated and not easy to get the first time, but its almost secondary to the brilliant acting and dialogue, as well as the direction and production. At the top is Russell Crowe. What a great performance. He shouldve gotten an Oscar for this one, too. And the rest of the cast is excellent, too. In terms of acting, it ranks alongside Shawshank Redemption and Fargo as the best of the 1990's and one of the truly great movies of all time.
B0000296SI|5.0|I loved the C.D. And I got inspired by the music from the movie Charlies angels which at the end has the song All the small things!  I loved it and I wanted to listen to the song more!  So i heard some of the other songs that blink182 sings And I loved it!
0440234743|3.0|This book is a little unusual for a Grisham novel -- nobody is truly evil and nobody is willing to kill to get what they want.  This is the most humane of Grisham's novels in that he presents the characters as more flawed (except the missionary woman who is very close to being perfect) than brutal.  The central male character is a recovering alcoholic and we suffer thru his relapses with him while the main plot plays out in the US and most interestingly in the Pantenal of Brazil, and the sub plot follows him coming to terms with the pain his drinking has caused for his kids and partners.  Unlike The Firm and The Pelican Brief, etc because the focus here is much more personal, much less wide-lens conspiracy.  I really liked this book.
B00005K3OT|5.0|First big suprise with this film was that it was filmed in English language, not French, so there are no subtitles.  I've read that more and more movies are being shot in the English language simply because the potential box office profit is so much huger. Put simply, this is a delightful film which many critics are probably grading downwards because it is \\"just\\" a simple story that is simply (but beautifully) told.  I am hardly ready to number myself among them!  Lasse Hallestrom, who first distinguished himself with the marvelous \\"My Life As A Dog,\\" knows his way around a film script and with actors and it shows.<br /><br />Playing much like a fable or fairy tale, Juliette Binoche is a woman, Vianne, who wanders from place to place with her daughter, Anouk, setting up shop as a chocolatier. This time she sets up shop in a peaceful French village in the winter of 1959. Delightful as the love story portion is with the river rat, Gypsy-like Johnny Depp, it is the hilarious war waged on Binoche by the town's mayor, played by Alfred Molina, who will reduce you to complete gut-busting laughter. His wife left him and his inability to deal with that fact fuels a lot of his animosity towards Vianne and the general air of sensual repression he wishes to foster in the village.  All of the villagers are delightful characters and Binoche is pulled into relationships with them.

B00003CXDZ|3.0|This was the only place I could find to give feedback on this movie times site.  There might be someplace available, but I couldn't find it.
B00000ILDE|5.0|When I saw the original in the theaters in 1987 I will never forget the scene of audience unity from the corner of my eyes during certain scenes. As if one the entire theater jerked back when the alien in the tank lunged at that little worm Burke's face. I don't think this kind of tension will ever be repeated.
B000002MU3|4.0|So-called because it was a \\"Monster\\" to complete, this album is a matter of love and hate.  People love it.  People hate it.  People love to hate it.  I'm one of those that hates to love it.<br /> There is no question that after \\"Automatic for the People\\", this album is a double-whammy disappointment.  First, it does a complete 180 from the soft, moody, and melodious \\"Automatic\\" to a loud, deliberately distorted sound.  It's hard to imagine a more abrupt transformation from one album to the next.  Second, it's not nearly as deep nor as consistent as \\"Automatic.\\"  But how could it be?  \\"Automatic\\" was brilliant ... a masterpiece.  Measured according to that standard, that \\"Monster\\" would be a disappointment is hardly a surprise ... almost any album would be.  But once you are willing to set aside your disappointment for what it could have been, \\"Monster\\" can be seen for what it is ... a fine rock-n-roll album, and a chance to lighten up a bit.<br /> As is the case with \\"Automatic,\\" the direction of the album is clear at the outset.  \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth\\" is all blistering guitars and heavy bass.  And it's ... well, it's fun.  How could anything poking fun at Dan Rather not be?<br /> The next song, \\"Crush with Eyeliner\\" is also replete with electric guitars and heavy bass, but it adds a couple of interesting musical elements ... a bluesy shuffle synchronized with a heavy guitar fuzzbox.  The shuffle works particularly well, because the song itself is about admiration for a woman \\"like three miles of bad road\\" walking down the street.  I have no problem at all imagining her stroking by.  \\"Crush with Eyeliner\\" is unique ... it's really hard to compare it to anything else ... the best I can do is say that it's like a down-and-dirty version of Roy Orbison's classic \\"Pretty Woman.\\"  Serious?  No.  Fun?  Yes.<br /> It's no secret that REM's work includes a lot of great ballads.  Add \\"Strange Currencies\\" to the list.  It has almost a country-western personality ... something you might expect to hear in a honky-tonk on a hot sweaty night.  It's quite similar to \\"Be Mine,\\" another ballad and one of the better songs on what I think is a weaker album ... \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi.\\"<br /> \\"Let Me In\\" is brilliant.  Reportedly written shortly after hearing of the suicide of Kurt Cobain, \\"Let Me In\\" has no bass-line and virtually no percussion ... just Stipe's lonely voice trying desperately to \\"break through\\" a screaming electric guitar ... a guitar that no doubt represents Cobain.  Over and over, he implores it to let him in ... but just like Cobain, it never does.  The grief and sense of loss come through loud and clear.  If only for this song, I think all of those who turned in \\"Monster\\" into the used CD bins are nuts.<br /> \\"Circus Envy\\" is a great head-knocker.  Simple, direct, and loud ... with a pounding beat and a psychedelic guitar to boot.  You could dent a dashboard playing rock-star drummer with this one.<br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the album is uneven.  It's been said that \\"Star 69\\" is a tribute to the Rolling Stones.  It sounds like it.  Unfortunately, it mimics the Rolling Stones at their worst ... the hard times between \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Some Girls.\\"  Something from their \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" era would have been a lot more satisfying.  \\"I Took Your Name\\" and \\"Bang and Blame\\" are OK, but \\"Tongue\\", \\"King of Comedy\\", and \\"You\\" are sub-par ... on the order of filler material.  But it's a rare album that escapes this flaw.<br /> If \\"Automatic\\" is like a fine wine, \\"Monster\\" is like Sangria.  It's not about bouquet and \\"oaky flavor\\" ... it's about drinking up and having fun.  Cheers.something you might expect to hear in a honky-tonk on a hot sweaty night.

B00000IAU3|5.0|There are so many words to describe this album.  It's wonderful, amazing, brilliant, and beautiful.  Her songs are lovely like a breath of fresh air.  &quot;Here With Me&quot; is a gorgeous opening track with wonderful music.  I love &quot;Hunter,&quot; and &quot;Thank You&quot;(great songs to relax to.  &quot;Don't Think Of Me&quot; is a little upbeat, but it's still pretty.  This cd is very calming and uplifting.  It is soothing to the soul.  I'd definitely recommend it.  It's truly a gem.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This album is unlike Vs. or Ten in that there's different stlyles and experimentations going on.  There's elements of punk, folk, and other different styles that may strike grunge fans as strange, but I guarantee you, you'll love this album.  The only missteps are the unusual Bugs, Aye Davinita, Pry, To, and Stupid Mop.  Fortunately, someone invented the skip button.  <br />Last Exit-8/10-A tense punkish song.  Gets the album started fairly well, but isn't one of the best songs.  After a while it gets annoying.  <br />Spin The Black Circle-10/10-Here we go!  One of the best rock songs Pearl Jam has ever done.  Great lyrics about vinyl records.  Great vocals, and a cool punk riff.  Boomshakalaka!! Sorry, I just couldn't resist.  <br />Not For You-9/10-Another great song.  Quiet riff and great vocals.  The song has a slower tempo, but there's a definite dark sense to it.  I love the melodic middle part.  Really boosts the song.  <br />Tremor Christ-7/10-Ugh.  Great lyrics.  Annoying riff and beat.  Slightly annoying vocals.  But there's something here that keeps it from being a weak song.  Maybe it's the mysterious chorus and spooky lyrics.  <br />Nothingman-10/10-Just an awesome slow song.  The most beautiful love song lyrics I've heard.  Great guitar riff with a tad of whammy bar thrown in for a great effect.  The vocal melodies are superb.  Once again  I stress the beauty of the lyrics.  They tell the tale of a lost love, and they both wish they could go back and change it, but it's too late.  They both love each other but they don't know it.  A perfect song.  Almost brings a tear to my eye.  <br />Whipping-9/10-A hard rock song.  Great lyrics about resistance.  Great guitar.  Cool chorus.  Gets all quiet and then bam! back to the loud verses.  <br />Prye, To-0/10-Erm, no comment. ....  <br />Corduroy-10/10-There we are.  After the disenchanting Pry, To, there's a great melodic rock song.  Cool guitar intro, punk chorus, nice poppy chorus.  Cool lyrics about independence.  A great bridge right in the middle with an insanely melodic riff and vocals.  Greatness.  <br />Bugs-4/10-Points for having an accordian.  Different.  ....  <br />Satan's Bed-9/10-Another tense rocker with better lyrics and polish than Last Exit.  Gossard can really write some awesome songs.  And Vedder's lyrics go without saying.  Kind of Beatlesque chorus and great lyrics about rejecting Beezulebub. <br />Better Man-10/10-Great pop song.  It was really annoying on the radio, but now that they've stopped playing it, you can see how great it is.  Great lyrics about a woman unhappy with marriage, but doesn't know how to exist on her own. <br />Aye Davinita-0/10-Another piece of experimental garbage.  Oh spare us.  <br />Immortality-10/10-An absolutely perfect acoustic song about Kurt Cobain's suicide.  The lyrics and music are just so mournful.  Great acoustic guitar solos.  Great climax.  Perfect line to describe this song is right at the end-\\"Some die just to live.\\"<br />Stupid Mop-0/10-Stupid is right.  Damn this experimentation.  STICK TO THE MUSIC, NOT SPOKEN WORD TRASH!!  Bad end to a great album:(<br />All in all, the albums high points outweigh the low.  A perfect record for a rainy day.  I saw this line somewhere, probably in another review, and it just sticks in my mind-\\"Spin this black cricle.\\"  What are you waiting for?!  DO IT!!
B000002BPS|5.0|I love every track of this cd. It's all good, from the meaning of life on down. Listen especially to &quot;I choose&quot; which has a great beat. Awesome Cd, I listen to it all the time.
B000059XYL|5.0|This film is amazing!  I have seen it twice now because I watched it twice in 12 hours it was so amazing!  If you havent seen it you definitely should!   Its all about a songwriter called Violet.  She moved to New York to try and persue her career.  To get some extra money she becomes a coyote.  (A bar maid in a bar called coyote ugly).  The coyotes dance on the bar and entertain the crowd.  Violet wants to get her songs sung by famous artists but people have to hear them first.  She is ok at singing other peoples songs in public but she gets scared when she has to sing her own songs.  Her boyfriend tries to help her to overcome her fear. WATCH THIS FILM!!
B000005S31|5.0|It's interesting to note that Coney Island Baby came out in the fall of 1975, just months after Metal Machine Music....  Coney Island Baby is perhaps Lou's finest solo album along with the fantastic Street Hassle.  All the tracks on this album are fantastic, no weak cuts anywhere.  Crazy Feeling starts it off with a bang, just a story about a guy lookin for love, be it a beautiful girl or be it a transvestite, in good old NYC....  This particular cut of She's My Best Friend is outstanding; it definately beats the old VU version.  Kicks is one of those Reed ballads in the tradition of Heroin and Street Hassle.  Kicks has a great beat, and even better lyrics.  I enjoy listening about a hitman who murders as a means of getting his kicks, especially when its in a swanky restaurant. This is definately one of the best Reed songs of all time.  A Gift is one of those funny songs where Lou pretends to be something he isn't.  Oooohhh Baby was a nice doo-wop.  Great storyline, about \\"the kind of girl that everyone's been worried about\\", a stripper in Times Square.  Nobody's Business is a soft song, placed well in between a fast paced song and a love poem.  Coney Island Baby is the gem of the album.  Pale Blue Eyes was once the Masterpiece; it has since been overthrown by this ballad.  The opening was interesting.  I liked the way Lou used football as the imagery to describe the meaness one encounters growing up on the mean streets of Brooklyn.  \\"Cause you know somethin' man, you gotta stand up straight or else you're gonna fall.  Then you're gonna die.\\"  The best part about this track is Lou's \\"tell it like is\\" style.  This shows up when Lou talks about so-called friends (\\"and they're talking behind your back saying, 'Man, you ain't never gonna be no human being'\\")and when he does some soul searching (when you're lonely, thinking about things you've done, which were bad and you hate them.)  It also displays itself toward the end, when Lou tells everyone the city is a funny place, filled with people and their peculiar tastes, a bit of NYC flavor in there (and in the rest of the album).  The most interesting thing about this song is that Lou Reed, the Rock N Roll Animal, proclaims that love is attainable.  Who knows, the glory of love just might come shining through.  In this case, it was his travestite partner Rachel, who was the centerpiece, the Coney Island Baby.  Overall, the lyrics were outstanding and the guitarist, I don't know if it was Lou or someone else, was terrific.  It's too bad this CD is unavailable in the US because it is classic Lou Reed.
B0000542DH|4.0|I'm not really going to review Natural Born Killers because whether or not you like this movie is completely different from one person to the next.  Since it is such a wild film, I would like to look at Oliver Stone's first commentary on this film.  The commentary on this DVD is very well done.  Stone simply states the reason Tarantino's script intriqued him and why he decided to make it.  He talks about the media and violence, and his use of several images and soundtracks to convey certain points about Mickey and Mallory.  With this insight, I was able to appreciate the film on a whole other level.  If you like the film or hate, just give Stone a chance to explain himself to you in this commentary.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|There are some people out there that hated this movie, I'm not one of them. Above all things this story is about LOVE. &quot;sigh&quot; and it shows in every detail starting with the parting of the theatre curtains, following with the music, cinematography, cast and crew and Baz Luhrmann with a vision. Above all things this story is about LOVE. <br />I've seen this movie for the third time and I love it more and more. I am beginning to really appreciate that Nicole Kidman did her own singing. Audrey Hepburn didn't do it in &quot;My Fair Lady,&quot; Leslie Caron didn't do it in &quot;Gigi&quot; or Natalie Wood in &quot;Westside Story.&quot; <br />Ewan is infectious and can sell a song. Of course he could sell anything with that smile.<br />I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I want to see if they show anything that was cut, there's a very small part of the story that seems unexplained and really doesn't effect the outcome but I have a feeling there might have been a scene that ties it together. This is destined to be a classic and I can't wait for the live version on stage.
B00003XACV|5.0|This is by far the best of the scores I've heard. It gives you so much peace. If you just close your eyes and dance or let your mind dance in a bed of velet rose petals. You can discover and recollect your own feelings with this CD. It's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I highly recommend this to music lovers and fans of the film alike. And especially dancers.
B00000255O|4.0|I love this era of Herbie,he gave up the funk so hard.&quot;Manchild&quot;,&quot;Thrust&quot;,and &quot;Headhunters&quot; are allworth owning.Props to bassPlayer Paul Jackson as well.This guy is seriously Mr.Thumpasaurus.Enjoy.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This cd is the greatest. Everytime I listen to it I love it more. From a great opening fast &quot;Around The World&quot; to a slower &quot;Easily&quot; the Red Hot Chili Peppers know how to make music. Unless you have no taste you'll love this album.

B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido's No Angel sounds angelic to me. Probably the most beautiful album Ive heard in awhile, Dido delivers a quiet, catchy package of tunes. &quot;Here with Me&quot; is beautiful and soft, like a warm blanket on a cold winters night. &quot;Thank You&quot;, the breakthrough second single is another standout and contains the chorus you just couldnt escape for awhile (and still cant on top 40 pop radio). Its strange that this cute as a button Dido had anything to do with Eminem; their conflicting personalities made his &quot;Stan&quot; and her &quot;Thank You&quot; a hit, and it seemed like an odd couple match in heaven. It worked beautifully. The whole album is listenable and theres no need to skip. Its laced with light pop, crunches of electronic ambience, and just the right amount of attitude (&quot;Dont Think Of Me&quot;). &quot;Hunter&quot; is another done me wrong song where our heroine sings about kings, queens, and crowns that feel too heavy now. With a dash of Alanis, Sinead, and on &quot;Take My Hand&quot;, maybe the dance street smarts of Madonna, Dido has been to Lilith and back, and all it took was a year for No Angel to sink into the TRL generations' skulls. Its like a great secret, a great cup of coffee,... or a nice warm blanket.
B000021Y77|5.0|I LOVED IT! My mom loved it. My high school classmates loved it (which surprised me). <br />Come on people, it's just a fun film. Why the heck does every film have to have some artsy - fartsy deep meaning? (I'm talking to you 1 and 2 star reviewers!) <br />Why does it have to be a smashing hit with an epiphany that makes you spill your latte on the floor of your overpriced arthouse in order for you to enjoy it? Why does it have to rival other German directors simply because it's German? <br />Well, I suppose the same people who said such nasty things about such a cool movie think that techno/drum n' bass is mindless simply because it isn't written and performed by a self - centered, barefoot wannabe gen - X hippie with a pretentious hypocritical attitude.<br />Well guess what -- SOME PEOPLE LOVED THE SOUNDTRACK! Maybe it's just a generation gap here, maybe not...my aging hippie (genuine 1960s/1970s) mom isn't a techno/dnb fanatic, and she even liked the soundtrack. (I love you mommy!)  <br />I guess everyone to their own...  *sob*
B00004X01U|3.0|Madonna has been music's immortal chameleon, its culturesponge. Using controversy to manipulate the media and laugh all the way to the bank, she is a business woman that plays dirty and we cant help but love her for it. Crafting some of the most memorable pop songs of our time(&quot;Papa Dont Preach&quot;, Get Into The Groove&quot;), she continues to keep us guessing and keep us opening our wallets. Her latest, Music, in my opinion is her weakest effort when you compare it to 1998's heavyweight Ray Of Light or 1989's Like A Prayer. Sure, its effortless and it may recall early madonna hits like &quot;Everybody&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot;, but she kind of got us spoiled on meaningful content and more substance, as on Ray and Prayer. Music delivers tunes that feel rushed and incomplete, and even her earliest seemed to have more appeal. Not that its all bad. &quot;Music&quot; the first single is excellent and probably her first well received dance song since 1990's &quot;Vogue&quot;. &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is good, but its forgettable. &quot;Amazing&quot; is &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot;:Part 2. Didnt she notice that in the studio? &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; may appeal to some fans, but it just seems to lack originality. &quot;Dont Tell Me&quot; is another good song, but like &quot;Impressive&quot;, its forgettable. The remixes for &quot;Dont Tell Me&quot; are better, and that maxi single is a wise choice. The same with &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;, which has great lyrics but lacks in music. The remixes for &quot;What&quot; are better. &quot;Paradise (Not for me)&quot; is an inticing song, but once again, seems incomplete. Music isnt a terrible album, but it is about three steps down from Ray Of Light, which gave us an experimental madonna dabbling with spirituality and most important originality and freshness, something madonna has established herself as: envelope pusher and a step ahead of the game. On Music it seems like shes sampling herself throughout her catalog. But never fear, Madonna is an excellent artist and shell be back. At least we got a tour out of this one.
B000002ADT|5.0|It is now not unusual to hear that this is THE best jazz record of all time. That is a proposition hard to confirm or reject. How does one compare the genius of Miles Davis with that of, say, Duke Ellington? Obviously, both are among the most major figures in jazz. And equally obviously this is among Miles's best recordings, and one of the most significant and best albums since World War II. I was lucky to be around 20 when this and many other major jazz records were produced, and to live in Amsterdam, where what was then called &quot;modern jazz&quot; enjoyed a warmly receptive response - one often at least as well-informed and discerning as in the US itself. In retrospect, I realise only too well that I lived, as a young listener, through one of the most satisfying and productive periods in jazz. This particular record struck us at the time as something unusual: a real &quot;event&quot;, where the sum of the music was greater than its parts, and where some fundamentally innovative structures were introduced for the first time, with complete success. As for the personnel, Davis himself was already the leading trumpet player of his time, and had been for some years. One hears here all the most striking characteristics: the unique, immediately identifiable tone (whichever way it gets produced), the subtlety of his phrasing, and of his variation (even within individual notes), his inventiveness, and the extraordinary emotional RANGE of his playing. Coltrane was, on this record, a revelation. To me, he had too often sounded uncontrolled, but here he proved himself masterfully authoritative, producing deeply fulfilling well-structured music of great profundity, originality and power. I do not think he ever played better, even on later recordings, though some of those are stunning (e.g. &quot;Africa Brass&quot;). &quot;Canonball&quot; Adderley was at the least equal to the demanding task that he had to face in being the third horn. The rhythm section was eminently flexible and dynamic; this was the time when rhythm sections were becoming a good deal less &quot;mechanical&quot;, and Miles's were always among the best. All in all, then, this was - and remains - an absolute classic, a  performance of enduring value, tremendous interest, imagination, vitality, and great feeling. One never ceases to enjoy this record, no matter how often one plays it, decade after decade. - Joost Daalder
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I went to this movie expecting it to be great and I got even more than I expected.  It was absolutely amazing!  The music was beautiful (both comical and dramatic at the same time) and the visualizations were so creative.  It boggles my mind to think of how imaginative the director is! The romance is grand and the story is beautiful.  I loved this movie!
B00003CXDZ|4.0|Wow! A whirlwind of colour and sound, intermixed with exceedingly clever contempory musical cliches, outrageously funny in parts, romantic, yet tragic. Baz Luhrman has gone where no other has with a musical. Luhrman's characteristic use of colour, sound, music and perspective is evident for those who have seen other films he has directed, such as 'Strictly Ballroom' and 'Romeo and Juliet'. Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the stunning 'night-club' performer 'Satine', searching for true love, but caught in the underworld lifestyle of the Moulin Rouge, is fantastic. While Ewan McGregor's performance as 'Christian', a writer trying to discover what love is, who is inadvertently drawn into the world of Moulin Rouge, is tremendous. Performances by Richard Roxburgh as 'Duke of Worcester', Jim Broadbent as 'Zidler', John Leguizamo as 'Toulouse Lautrec' and Jacek Koman as 'The Unconscious Argentinian' were equally magnificent. Moulin Rouge is SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR! A must see...even if you don't like musicals.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I have never even seen this movie yet...but based on the soundtrack alone I am enthralled. One may think that the use of such sappy song mainstays like &quot;I will always love you&quot; and &quot;Your song&quot; won't make for glorious listening but they are so far from wrong. Placed together, these songs form one continuous emotion...describing every degree of heartache and longing. It is magnificent. The song &quot;Come What May&quot; is definitely ther highlight in an album full of diamonds. Even though Nicole Kidman does not possess a strong vocal talent, her efforts are real and therefore much more enthralling. There is nothing bad about this soundtrack...I have played it nonstop for about a week now, and i'm still in love. Believe me, it's that good!
0793518326|5.0|Truly the Beatles wrote the best collection of songs that has ever been made, and that still stands today in this current world of less music and more skin/beat. Basically, for the first few days after recieving this book guitarists and even keyboard players can take it easy and just play their favorite Beatles songs in chords. Then you can simply move on to the specifics. You can play every individual part of the song and get them right. I have yet to find an inaccuracy in the book, but apparently other reviews state there are so I'll keep my ears and eyes open for them. This book has been great for my band. We've only had it for about a month, but already The Beatle music has made practice more fun and a lot more colorful. So I highly recommend this book to anybody out there who wants to play great music and doesn't have the time to write it out on their own. As a bonus, it's also a great book for learning other instruments.

B00003CXRP|4.0|I actually give the movie a 3-1/2, but I would rather give it four than three.  Can Tom Hanks really carry a movie on his own?  We all know the answer is yes.  In fact, with a little more help from the rest of the cast, this movie could have been phenomenal.  Anyways, a quick breakdown of the plot is that Tom Hanks, a FedEx manager whose life is based around a busy schedule that takes him all over the world, is marooned on a deserted island for several years after his plane crashed (a very frightening crash at that) somewhere in the pacific ocean.  Hanks's time on the island is where he truly shines.  Not many actors can make you believe that man could actually cry at losing his volleyball.  I will not go into detail about his time there as it is so entertaining in every way, however after he escapes from the island (yes, we all knew he would) he comes home to find his old girlfriend remarried.  A little better script towards the end of the movie would have made such a difference in turning a very good movie into a great movie.  Helen Hunt is given a somewhat thankless role, but is believable enough to at least make something happen.  The ending speech by Hanks, although sounding a little hollywood, reminds us of how quickly life changes and how much we take the luxuries of life for granted.
B00005BL2A|3.0|I've followed Depeche Mode since &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; came out in 1982 and i've bought every album that DM have released. Exciter is their most radical departure in sound to date. The sonic textures are fantastic and innovative - quite unlike anything else today. However there are some songs which sound like Nine Inch Nails, which sound somewhat dated and gloomy. But echoes of their past glory come through with the powerful and acheingly beautiful &quot;Freelove&quot; - this is most gorgeous melody Depeche have written since &quot;Home&quot; or &quot;Somebody&quot;. If they release it as a single, it'll be at least top 3 in the UK.<br />The rest of the album is good in parts, but that &quot;zombie room&quot; song is just plain embarrassing. <br />Compared to the Pet Shop Boys (who seem to get better and better with each album), Depeche seem to be on their last legs.  Occasionally, flashes of pure brilliance , such as &quot;Freelove&quot; shine through the gloom, but i can't help feeling that the end of the road is near for Depeche.<br />A pity....
014028009X|4.0|Okay, okay, it's not a great piece of literature.  For those looking for a stimulating, challengning novel, head for the hills!  But, if you're looking for a hilarious, different book about what some women think like, _Bridget Jones's Diary_ is for you.  It's not a long read- most will finish it in a day or two and it depicts the fantasticly funny adventures of one Bridget Jones.  How to describe Bridget?  Well, you'd have to figure it out for yourself.  She figures that her New Years resolutions don't apply to January first because everyone knows that the New Year really starts on January second.  I couldn't believe the situations Bridget managed to get herself into.  Most of them had me rolling on the floor with laughter.  This book is not meant to be taken too seriously.  Bridget is a bit of an alcoholic and totally obsessed with everything in her life, but she does seem to be real and most women (and maybe some men!) will see a little bit of Bridget in themselves.  Plus, we get a whole new vocabulary with this book.  Hurrah for the singletons!  _Bridget Jones's Diary_ is the perfect little book for a pick me up on a sad day and will probably keep you reading into the night.  For those looking for a painfully funny book that's pretty down to earth, pick up _Bridget Jones's Diary_.
B00000099Y|2.0|There's GOT to be someone out there that doesn't like this band. Aenima has two good songs - Die Eire Von Satan and Stinkfist. The rest of it is average heavy radio grunge, nothing more. These guys are out to shock rather than musically impress. To me, if you've heard one of their songs, you've heard 'em all. It amazes me that people consider these guys &quot;deep and emotionally moving&quot;. I find them fairly one dimensional; a band like Mr. Bungle outclasses these guys in originality AND depth by light years. It also amazes me that people call this band &quot;metal&quot;. Every song from Undertow and Aenima is the same riff played in a different time signature. Then again, this is the nineties, the only decade that's musically WORSE than the eighties. With so much garbage out there, no one from this unadventurous generation is motivated to explore groups that crush this sorry band and no one wants to.
B00005B36H|1.0|My theory is that Rick Wakeman (frontman of Yes and public enemy #1) is the bassist for Tool, and he writes all of the music.  It is seriously that bad.  I've never really liked this band but before my biggest complaint was the childish anti-christian lyrics.  Now I dislike them for all the same resons I dislike Yes and the Alan Parsons Project.  Maybe next they'll do an album about stonehenge.  That'll be rad.  In the meantime all you sheep-like drones can sit around and pretend that time signature changes constitutes &quot;brilliant music&quot;.

B000002GWJ|4.0|Don't be deterred that the most out of place and tiresome song on this CD is the very first one.  West Side Story's \\"Somewhere\\" never fails to bring my index finger stabbing at the button to skip to the next track.  From there on out it is smooth sailing with songs that rank right up there with the quality of those on \\"Small Change\\" both lyrically and in the performance.  Songs such as \\"Christmas Card...\\" and \\"$29.00\\" tell rich stories with empathy, intelligence, and not a single contrived rhyme.  It's as if everything that was perfect to say already happened to fit perfectly into the structure of the song.  They cannot be improved upon.  Taken as a whole, the last nine songs of this CD maintain a steady mood and pace.  This is different from the diversity of some of his other albums in that you can get lost in the feeling and let time slip away without being wrenched out of the mood by a comedic or fast song.  I rate this CD as one of the essential Tom Waits recordings if you pretend like \\"Somewhere\\" isn't on it.
B000002UUH|4.0|Why has nobody reviewed this classic CD? I believe this cd is now 12 years old. If your looking for just about every hit that John put out, you really need to purchase this. It starts off with the classic &quot; Give Peace a Chance&quot; followed by a great favorite of mine &quot; Instant Karma&quot;. From there it only gets better with a total of 19 tracks on it. About the only songs I really don't care much for are &quot; Beautiful Boy &quot; and &quot;Happy X-Mas &quot; . I would rated this 5 stars if not for these 2 clunkers! You get a pretty nice booklet with this cd complete with all the lyrics to the songs. ( I do wish it would have told what instruments John and others played on each song, though. Believe me you need to purchase this if John's music meant anything yo you. You won't be disappointed!
B000001FSR|4.0|This CD starts out with perhaps one of the best &#8220;road trip&#8221; songs of all time &#8220;Hang on St. Christopher&#8221; and continues taking you places for the next 16 songs.  Of course, because it&#8217;s Tom Waits taking you there you are taking a trip into shattered dreams, self-destruction, alcoholism, and ultimately the cold, cold ground.  The CD contains the song for a two-act play, so beyond the attraction of being one of his best recordings, it is also the most cohesive.  Following Frank&#8217;s story from song to song is just as good a reason to buy the CD as the memorable tunes, brilliant lyrics, creative use of studio techniques, and diverse instrumentation.  If I have one criticism, it is that Waits&#8217; singing is sometimes too theatrical and melodramatic.  It&#8217;s usually when he&#8217;s singing first person as Frank, but it helps to tell the story so it&#8217;s not out of place, per se.  But &#8220;good&#8221; acting is when the audience is not conscious of the process of acting.
0380730367|5.0|I started \\"Prayers for Rain\\" with a great deal of trepidation.  I found Dennis Lehane's last novel, \\"Gone, Baby, Gone,\\" a great story, but totally emotionally exhausting.  I wasn't sure that I could handle another novel like that again on short notice.  So I waited a bit.  When I finally gave in and started to read it, I found myself completely spellbound.  If &quot;Gone, Baby, Gone&quot; sent Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro on a death spiral that left both shattered and destroyed their relationship, &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot; is the noir version of working your way back up.<br />Karen Nichols comes to Patrick Kenzie for help with a stalker.  Patrick, stirred out of his depression at his separation from Angela, calls on his friend Bubba, and they address the problem in their typical, violent fashion.  All appears well.  At least it does until Karen jumps naked to her death six months later.<br />Driven by a sense of responsibility, Kenzie looks into the suicide and discovers that Karen was carefully driven from being happy and successful to prostitution and complete character dissolution.  Somewhere, hidden behind layers of deception hides a psychotic monster that relishes the destruction of human psyches.  Joined with Bubba and reunited with Angela, Kenzie goes on the offensive, and quickly runs into violent opposition.<br />Faced with an opponent armed with seemingly inexhaustible resources, and outmaneuvered at almost every turn, our three musketeers find themselves in a running battle for their sanity and their lives.  Layer after layer of deception mask the killer and his plots, and Kenzie and Gennaro must dig deep to find the right answers.  The action is fast paced and violent, and the complex cat-and-mouse game provides fascinating interest.<br />Bubba, the sociopathic gunrunner, plays a far larger part in &quot;Prayers for Rain&quot; then he has in previous novels.  Still not fully developed, he plays a vital part in the action and in helping to resolve the tensions between the main characters.  His motivations are unexpected, and sometimes horrific, but he provides an unusual model of loyalty and friendship.  By the time the novel is done, the reader will find he or she has developed a wary affection for Bubba, and a deeper respect for Kenzie and Gennaro.<br />This is one of Lehane's masterpieces.  Truly worthwhile reading.ve the tensions between the main characters.  His motivations are unexpected, and sometimes horrific, but he provides an unusual model of loyalty and friendship.

B00004STPT|5.0|I saw the movie.  I loved it, as did my mom and dad.  Somehow, someway I talked my dad into letting me buy the soundtrack.  I mean, it *seemed* promising, right?  Boy, talk about an understatement.  This is the best music I've ever heard.  Hans Zimmer did an incredible job.  My mom and dad fight over this other copy they got after they heard mine.  My friend fights over it with her brothers.  It is *the* best.  Hands down.  Lisa Gerrard's vocals are haunting, beautiful, and mysterious all at once.  I get goosebumps when I hear &quot;Sorrow.&quot;  But of all the tracks the best is &quot;The Battle&quot; especially that little part about five minutes into it.  I've heard the score a zillion times and I'm yet to get tired of it.  And I never will.  An absolute must for anyone who like music or soundtracks or movies.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Hi! This is my first review, but oh well! I had known Savage Garden for a while, back when I heard \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\" (Which is still a truly awesome song.) ....After listening to it once(Affirmation), I was in awe. All the songs were good. There was no need to skip any of the tracks! My personal favorite was \\"Crash and Burn\\" because it is very true. Someone is always caring and looking after you, even if you're having an awful time in life. All the lyrics to the other songs are really incredible as well. \\"Two Beds and a Coffee Machine\\" is really depressing while \\"the Animal Song\\" is fun and catchy. If you are into really heart-felt lyrics and a guy with an awesome voice, go buy this CD now!
B00004SCX6|3.0|This album was not as good as 'Baby'. The chunes aren't as catchy but are still pretty good.

B00003CXQY|5.0|I rented this movie on DVD just because I hadn't seen it yet, and I was bored. I was TOTALLY suprised at how good this movie was. You would think that because it's a Disney movie the humor would be aimed more towards kids, but the jokes and story really had me laughing along too. This movie is totally funny, and a great DVD as well.

Fairport Convention is at their height here, and the album is powerful and engaging from the first note to the last. This is one of the essential albums in any Folk-Rock fan's collection.
B000002AGN|5.0|I have to agree that this is one of the most accessible jazz albums ever. Even people who profess to dislike jazz, like &quot;Blue Rondo&quot; and &quot;Take Five&quot;. It was a groundbreaking album, never meant or expected to become the hit it was. It was done as an experiment in odd-meters. I won't pretend to know anything about what that means exactly, I am no musician, but I do know what I like. And this album is one of my all time favourites, be it jazz or otherwise. Some reviewers have said that it is overrated. But how can you overrate something that is so wonderful and a work of art? This is an album that should belong in every home. The 16 page booklet includes the original liner notes, tons of photos and an essay by Dave Brubeck himself.
0385501560|5.0|As one of the many &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to Palahniuk&quot; readers out there, I went and got this book on the day it was released.  Actually, I left work early I was so excited.  And to be honest, I'm glad I was not too disappointed because he is one of my favorite authors.  Instead of doing this the &quot;old fashioned way&quot; and writing out what I liked and didn't like in a paragraph format, I'm going to make a list.  Here goes nothing. What I liked: 1) The character development was great, as usual. 2) It was fast paced and enjoyable to read, as usual. 3) For the subject matter it was extremely hilarious. What I didn't like: 1) The ending...at least part of it.  I don't want to spoil it for other readers but it was way out there, even for Palahniuk. 2) The fact that I'm done reading it and now I have to wait for the next book! I will definitely recommend this book to my friends and to people who have a wacky sense of humor who want a good book to read.  Oh yeah, and don't say I didn't warn you about the ending. :)
B000055Y12|4.0|After a Russian officer defects to the United States, the gouvernment learns of a special French intelligence agent in Cuba, called Topaz. It seems Topaz has access to NATO secrets and in turn, deals that information to the Russians, which means a double agent must be involved somewhere. The Russian agent reveals all this to Michael Nordstrom (John Forsythe), who      decides the best course of action to call on his friend and trusted associate,Andre Devereaux (Frederick Stafford, who spend some days with his wife Nicole (Dany Robin), his young-married daughter Michle (Claude Jade) and his son-in-law Francois Picard (Michel Subor) in New York. So Devereaux heads off to Havana, where he hopes to learn more about Topaz and also scout the potential missiles that have been rumored to exist in the area. There his love Juanita (Karin Dor) is killed by diplomate Parra (John Vernon). Andre follows his family to Paris to find out, who leads &quot;Topaz&quot;. Michle ask her mother for help to Andre, but Nicole says &quot;There's nothing I can do&quot; - Nicole haves an affair with the leader von &quot;Topaz&quot;...  This movie turns out to be decent enough, but it seems like a real let down, since it came from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Betrayal between all the persons, played by an international cast: young Claude Jade, made famous by Francois Truffaut's &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; and &quot;Bed &amp; Board&quot;, as Andre's worried daughter, Dany Robin also from France as her mother, Michel Subor from Godard's &quot;Little Soldier&quot; as son-in-law, Michel Piccoli and Philippe Noiret as &quot;topaz&quot;-spies, the german actress Karin Dor as the cuban lady in Hitchcock's most underrated thriller.
006092988X|5.0|This book covers all emotions experienced by human beings successfully: rage, sadness, happiness...There are already many good reviews for this book out there, so I won't write paragraphs.  I just wanted to say that this book is not for very young readers: it's maybe just a tad too realistic.  After all, one does want to believe in Santa Claus for awhile. This is a book worth reading.  It opened a new and deeply moving world to me which I'm not sure I want to explore further, but I probably will because Betty Smith has caught me in her web.   I am searching for A Joy in the Morning, and will probably enjoy it just as much.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|After seeing &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; in theaters yesterday, the songs from the movie have been irrevocably branded in my soul, much to my joy. This move is so wonderful, and all the songs are so perfect.<br />For the nay-sayers who thought David Bowie's &quot;Nature Boy&quot; was a little too dry have obviously not seen the film. This is the beginning piece that basically introduces Ewan McGregor's character, Christian. It's superb, to say the least.<br />Speaking of Ewan, THAT MAN HAS ONE SET OF PIPES!! Let me just say that all of my friends walked out of the theater wishing their beaus could belt out such gorgeous notes. He's fantastic, and the best male singer I've heard in a long time.<br />Nicole was a HUGE HIT too. She's absolutley hypnotising in this movie, and her vocals for the soundtrack are PHENOMENAL! Usually, I cringe when actors try to sing in movies, but my expression while listening to her melodies was the antithesis of cringing. <br />I have to say, too, that my absolute favorite song on this is &quot;El Tango de Roxanne&quot;. This song &quot;opened the flood gates&quot;, as they say. My other faves are &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot;(you'll love it if you love great Indian music), &quot;Come What May&quot; (for all you hopeless romantics out there!) and &quot;Because We Can&quot; (if you keep still while listening to this song, check your pulse--you may be dead). <br />All in all, this is a wonderful cd, with talent gushing out of it's plastic case.

I agree that sometimes the book drags on, but then so do many classics...I'm not very picky but I have read many books, and so from experience I say that this book is not one to miss out on...it's not as harsh as some other of Daphne Du Maurier's books, such as My Cousin Rachel, which I had to put down after a few chapters because it depressed me too much.

I'm scared of the diabolical inhabiting my neighborhood and Stephen King planted the seed of my recently acquired paranoia.<br />This book will haunt you. The characters created by Mr. King are very real and his ability to make them so real is frightening in and of itself. The town of Derry is a setting not unlike my own community and probably a bit like yours as well.

6303159966|3.0|This film is based on the novel by Stephen King, quite faithfully as for the pattern but not the details, the flesh of the story. It emphasizes, with the images, the ugliness of the situation, of the panic of the mother in this situation that is clearly shown as a punishment for her unfaithfulness due to the direct connection between the two situations. It is all the more frightening because they are trapped by a dog, a dog being the best friend of man and here it turns rabid and it kills as many people as it can, and no one can do anything to stop it, except the mother when she discovers her  boy is dead. Then she finally finds the energy to fight and kill the dog. It is also made more poignant by the fact that the dog is a Saint-Bernard, a dog that is known for its benevolence, and its helpful character as for its relations to men and women. Here it is a killer. But the film remains rather flat after all because too many details are avoided. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.

0451197968|5.0|The book is based on the extreme hypothesis that America could become a fascistic country, with three zones and social groups : the rich and happy business downtown area, the poor, famished and under- or unemployed working class derelict area, and the camps for the opponents who are authorized to survive and not be executed. Television is the absolute tool to dominate and control the people by providing them with old circus games like in Roman times. The main game is The Running Man, where a man is supposed to resist some super-duper-monstrous state-fighters who use all kinds of technology against empty-handed men. The book releases the designated fighters (ex-convincts who dream of a chance) directly in the second zone of society where they have to survive. The whole game changes when the cop who refused to kill innocent people in Bakersville is brought into the picture. He will manage to help the resistance, so that the truth will be broadcast on television, and he will capture a plane and destroy the whole television building, including the main master of ceremonies. But there is no hope, because the « hero » dies in his plane that crashes against the building, and the resistance does not stand one chance against the police and the army of the state. This book is signed Richard Bachman, and it is absolute pessimistic science-fiction. There is no future, there is no hope, there is no anything you want. We are living in a bleak dead alley that has no way out. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.
B00003CXN4|1.0|This show was way over rated by Critics and I'm very dissapointed after watching it. The show is so real that it is so flat. Basically watching some documentary flim is not my idea of a good picture or movie. The actors were great but this show just have not enough impact. All reviews you read should be really considered before you watch this show. Rent it if you must, but don't buy for the sake of people's review. I'm very sure that are people who hated this show after watching it and would agree that they were just as disappointed wasting your time on such a movie.No doubt they may win something for the movie awards but I give full thumbs down to this movie. I give my vote to Moulin Rouge.
B00000JGEN|3.0|This film has not lost so much after all the years, as a film.  Good action, spectacular events and a society that can be qualified by no word in our language. The future in all its negative colors the way Ray Kurzweil dreams it but pretends we can manage not to fall into.<br /><br />When machines are so strong that we cannot even compete with them, when television is nothing but a screen show that does not need any reality at all to be broadcasted, when society has become a world cut in two: the rejects of society, the modern slaves entirely dominated and exploited with no consideration on the price, the cost of a death among them. One dead ten reprieved from the other side of society. There are always discontented people who will follow their impulses into slavery if they have the opportunity to do so.<br /><br />On the other hand the people who accept the don't-ask-any-question society they live in, the don't-question-anything-at-all world in which they survive with a little bit of black market. And for those \\"happy ones\\" who do not run the risk of dying on a whim from a schizophrenic warden there is television, or should I say reality shows that are real as long as the preys accept to be preys, and turns virtual when there is a gravel in the engine. Television, reality or virtuality, is a lie anyway and a hand in your brain, if you have one, otherwise it is a hand in your pants and your various perversions.<br /><br />The film then is a marvelous story that debunks all authoritarian and totalitarian regimes that base their power on TV and mental manipulation. And yet the film is careful to avoid the worst ending of them all, the example of what could be done, not the underground dreaming resistance that uses matches against flamethrowers and toothpicks against nuclear weapons. Not that parody of a vengeance (A second coming of blood: I will be back) that leads to nothing except more dictatorship and suffering on the day after. But what Stephen King imagined.<br /><br />The Butcher of Bakersville does manage to escape and he gets to some airport and captures a helicopter and rams it into the TV studios, destroying the whole building that collapses into rubbles. That's a sacrifice to destroy the system, not the main clown of it, the headquarters of the mental manipulation at stake here not the master of ceremonies, the maitre de that has taken too many steroids in his youth, thinking it was going to boost his intelligence. You can't help those that have a weak brain. They often deserve what they get when they pretend to govern the world, and those who elect them deserve what they get.<br /><br />But be careful. At times it is them, the feeble brained ones, who get at the top and then the whole world becomes a circus and you are part of their menagerie. So enjoy the film and regret the ending that is so sugary and sweet I had a fit of diabetes and needed some insulin.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUville does manage to escape and he gets to some airport and captures a helicopter and rams it into the TV studios, destroying the whole building that collapses into rubbles.

6301572688|5.0|The action is just as spectacular, maybe even more, than in the first film of the series. But this film innovates by choosing a directly political subject : the end of apartheid in South Africa and the criminal activities of the souoth african diplomatic bodies in the US, selling gold krugerbands for dollars, eliminating the main opponents to the regime, persecuting and victimizing the cops who, on the basis of their own hatred of apartheid, take part in a movement against it and try to prevent or stop their trafficking, and eventually, as a result of the fight that comes out of their blocking action, the people who organize this traffic, the diplomats and their valets who are criminals under diplomatic immunity. This political clear-cut discourse is a rare thing in an action film and this is the great merit of this film and its actors to be militants for a just cause, the humanistic battle against a fascist regime. It is often done with humor, and they introduce a new character, a certain Leo, who is both short in size, unquenchable in speech and admirably funny in his careless and carefree and often unconscious actions, especially since he is a state witness in a case of money laundering for drug traffickers. He is a constant and active member of the action. The subject of course is old today, because apartheid has disappeared and Nelson Mandela has changed many things in South Africa, with the help of a lot of international solidarity, but it does not make us nostalgic at all. It becomes some kind of a lesson about our duty to support causes that defend human rights and plain justice. This is a committed film, in the best meaning of « commitment », a word invented by great people like Jean Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and many post-Second-World-War philosophers and intellectuals. We seem to hear Camus saying in the wings his new « cogito » : « We are rebelling, therefore we are. » Some will say it is old-fashioned, but is it really old-fashioned in the days of the fall of the Iron Curtain, of the Berlin Wall, of the bamboo curtain, of all those regimes that had inspired many of us by its general revolutionary principles and that had completely and systematically betrayed those principles of humanitariasnism, justice, freedom, and culture, education, health and wealth for everyone, creating the worst imaginable system of repression and elimination, a system that was based on trials where the victims confessed their « crimes » and agreed with their sentences that were transformed into heroic acts by and for the regime, like the goulag camp that built the canal to the the White Sea ? This film enables people in my generation to rethink many historical elements. It enables people of younger generations to remember or rediscover our fights for freedom and justice in the worst possible conditions, and I think, it may be able to inspire many younger and less young people in their fight for a new world order based on solidarity and equality of chances for all. We can think of the exemplary fight of Nelson Mandela and the new South Africa for cheap drugs to deal with the AIDS pandemoc in Africa and their phenomenal victory that negates international industrial property regulations, with the agreement of the proprietors of this industrial property, viz. the medical and pharmateucical firms. Such an action film that becomes the educational field for a higher awareness of our duty to struggle for justice, freedom, equality, human and civil rights all over the world is the best possible tool we can provide younger people with in order to make them understand their own, personal and ethical duty and necessary commitment.

0553278398|4.0|For readers of the original Foundation novels, this novel actually depicts Hari Seldon as a person, not as a God figure.  Really the best bridge between the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series, in this novel we are finally allowed to see Trantor, the Galactic Empire's capital, before the Empire's fall has truly begun.<br />Seldon, a mathematician, has developed a theory which in concept might be applied to predict the general outcome of events affecting humanity, but only on a very large scale.  But the theory is essentially useless -- impractical.  This failing is brought to light very early, and provides the drive for the story, as Hari tries to observe humanity so as to develop interpretive Laws to make his theory, Psychohistory, practicable after all.  <br />He proceeds to visit various locales of the planet, each region almost a world unto itself on the great city-world that is Trantor.  He is alternately pursued, assisted, and hampered by scheming factions in the Imperial structure.  <br />Asimov does provide us some info on the adventures of Seldon, but there are really no surprises in this book.  From the first meeting with some of the characters I had their nature identified.  Although Seldon is ignorant and very often surprised by the unsettling behavior of people he encounters, in keeping with his ignorance of humanity.  Seldon is presented almost like a country bumpkin gone to the city.  Nevertheless, having read the Robot and Empire novels (in the latter of which should this novel be counted, not purely as the first Foundation novel, in my opinion) this is a good bridge leading into the Foundation series.  If you have not read the Empire novels, nothing really would be lost, but some confusion may result from not reading the Robot novels first.  In fact, if the Robot series were not read, some of the obvious clues to which I earlier referred would not be caught.  In any case, this novel does a good job of presenting the problems with the Galactic Empire, which in my mind has many similarities to the Old Republic from Star Wars (A decrepit government ruled from a single large city-planet, e.g.), and thus leading very well into the Foundation series.

B000056JYB|5.0|Long overdue, Blind Faith gets the red-carpet treatment. The original album tracks plus bonus tracks on disc 1, Disc 2 has 4 unreleased 'jams'. And that's what they are, just jams, nothing really exciting but interesting nonetheless. Any Blind Faith fan will want to own this package. The MFSL gold version may sound better but this is as good as it's going to get for now. How nice to hear 'Do what you like' more clearly, still a killer track after all these years. A detailed booklet rounds out a essential package. Nice job Polydor!

B00003CXN4|1.0|This movie was by far one of the WORST movies I've ever seen!!  However if you can watch 5 movies at one time and keep up with each movie all at the same time then I suppose you'll like this movie.  If you're like me and only care to watch one movie at a time then this movie is NOT for you!  I found this movie confusing, boring, and horrible!  I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone.  All of my friends agree that it was horrible and can not figure out what all of these people who say that it's going to be a classic are talking about!
B00000BKDW|5.0|This was the classic 'follow-up' CD to 'Piece of mind', and the public was expecting, well, something maybe - similar?.  And what could a Maiden fan expect?  They got primo-gold Maiden - as this CD is considered amongst the fans (as well as me) one of the best things they ever did...my enthusiatic vote for 5 is not unfounded.<br />I have been following IM for years, and have respected everything they have ever did - and believe me, have not liked all that I have seen!  But to step back to this era of their greatness...this CD is simply one that has to be in EVERYONE's collection.<br />No, this CD is not 'Maiden in a jar' - but will definitely give you the impetus to get more - start with 'Piece of mind' and 'Number of the beast'...you will be hooked soon!
B00005B36H|4.0|Los Angeles art-rockers Tool have finally emerged from a five year hiatus to release their newest album, Lateralus.  The long awaited album full of Tool's trademark sound is filled with plenty of new material, but still may be lacking in the shadow of their previous album, Aenima.  The first single, \\"Schism\\", with its eerie bass riff is recognizable Tool material, and eventually erupts later into a frenzied rock assault.  The entire CD, nearly 80 minutes long has the usual odd tracks and sound effects as expected, but is wrapped in  a translucent, multicolored case that gives nothing more than track titles, band members' names and studio names.  While certainly a refreshing change from the usual CD cases, the only complaint is the loss of lyrics and other information that fans may enjoy.  Other noted tracks on the album include \\"The Patient\\", which is strangely soothing until it's early climax barely halfway into the song.  \\"Parabol\\" will cause listeners to turn up the volume, just before being assaulted with a gritty, sustained rock guitar wail into \\"Parabola\\".  Possibly the most reserved track on the entire album is \\"Disposition\\" a quiet, calming track of acoustic guitar and Maynard James Keenan's amazingly soothing vocals. Even after a five year wait this album is a must have, but still far from being as powerful as some of their previous works.
0812035062|2.0|Heller's novel gave our language a new term, but the popularity of it should be tempered by its overriding flaw--it's contrived. But go ahead and read this book for entertainment, though I don't believe you will learn much or perceive insights into war, institutional behavior, etc.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Winner of 5 Oscars including Best Picture, Gladiator is an astonishingly engaging epic spectacle with a grand action-drama genre. The action is brilliant; you get everything from gruesome killings to leaping tigers in some visual effects that look truly real, you won't even notice they are computer-generated or CGI. The drama is the heart of the movie however, the back-story is the story of a man, his love for his family, his strong abilities and his will to escape. This man is played to perfection by Russell Crowe in one of his most gritty roles to date. There is also a fantastic supporting cast - Oliver Reed, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen and Amistad's Djimon Hounsou - all give life to interesting roles. Okay, so there are lots of flaws in the editing, Joaquin's scar changing from right to left and an aeroplane crossing the arena, but, this is a movie you watch for enjoyment, not to diss the mistakes that come up, even though they do. The film also has an amazing DVD with great stills, a brilliant making of feature and a 2-disk special. Enjoy!
1559409010|5.0|Come on, let's face it...the scene in Pilates court with &quot;Bwian&quot; and the guards is the funniest thing I have yet seen. Even now, after dozens of times watching this movie, I still laugh until tears flow.
B00000251N|5.0|From the book...to the score...to the film, JLS is a defining moment in Neil Diamond's career.  I still ponder, though, how the man who also brought us &quot;Cherry Baby&quot; and a glob of other bubbly pseudo-hits from the '60s &amp; '70s ever got selected to do this masterwork!  It is to Diamond's credit that his solid vocals and obvious empathy for the spirit of JLS gelled as well as it did with all the other elements that went into this multi-media masterpiece.  I only wish that Neil Diamond had taken a right turn in his &quot;pop&quot; career with the NeoClassical genre that he seemed to step into so easily with JLS, and redirected his work instead towards more memorable, meaningful efforts (if not always pop-chart toppers!).  For Diamond, the JLS project was the like the man at the carnival who gets so many turns at the hammer to ring the top bell...hits it only once...and then quickly runs out of steam, falling short with all his subsequent efforts.  JLS was Neil Diamond's most noble work: why did you stop, man?!  You had THE juice for one bright, shining moment in your career!!

0553212737|5.0|This was a book that I 'tried' to read in 5th grade and fell asleep,  now years later I decided to give it another shot.  To my suprise,  Emma was a delightful book.  At times it may seem boring, but at those times I learned to savor the details that I did read.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters and plot twists.   Jane Austin is an absolutely amazing author!  I do not reccomend this book to younger kids who have trouble reading or get bored easily,  but it is perfect for teenagers and up,  esspecially girls. :)
B000002UAO|5.0|All right I had to write another better more helpful review on one of my favourite albums ever.  The Beatles are my favourite band to begin with and this was the album that got me started on them. Rubber Soul was the turning point were the Beatles matured greatly.  This album was very solid just four guys playing great rock 'n roll! The album is very special to me and I recommend it to anyone. If you want to get into the Beatles here is where you start.  Check it out!  You will not be disappointed believe me, this album changed my life!
B00005A8MA|5.0|I have been a fan of John Mayall since I was 10 years old and have enjoyed nearly all his music before and since, but Back To The Roots merits a special place on the long list of Mayall blockbusters. The 1960s and early 1970s were a period of tremendous creative ferment in the world of music and Mayall was always in the vanguard of experimentation. He is known to most who know of him as a blues artist, but on this CD he stretches that concept even beyond the new musical ground covered on his groundbreaking album Turning Point. On Back to the Roots, Mayall touches more on social issues and the everyday concerns of the people than at any time before or since. What commuter couldn't relate to Prisons on the Road, a song even more meaningful today than it was in 1970? Accidental Suicide is a cautionary song about the dangers of excessive drug use. Groupie Girl ridicules the bimbos who are &quot;chasing after fake love in the world&quot;. Marriage Madness expounds Mayall's view that marriage is a legal albatross around an individual's neck, however he has since come a long way from the libertine sentiments expressed in this and in his earlier hippie anthem, Room to Move. Mr. Censor Man lashes out at the tyranny of the censorship that was then fairly prevalent. One of my favorites, lyrically, is Television Eye, which denounces the hypnotic and addictive power of television and its commercials which try to make him &quot;buy things I'll never use&quot;. Along with the social commentary the listener is treated to some damn good music throughout, including the remixes of some of the songs with Joe Yuele on drums dubbed in. Mayall once again assembled an all-star cast of musicians, some of whom are still well-known today and those who have faded into obscurity. The well-known include Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor, while the more obscure include such late 60s-early 70s heavyweights as guitarist Harvey Mandel, sax and flute player Johnny Almond, violinist Sugarcane Harris, and legendary drummer Keef Hartley. While Back to the Roots offers little in the way of traditional blues, there is a lot of Mayall's signature piano here and a lot of good progressive music in the inimitable Mayall style. This CD deserves more than five stars and I say its about time that this superb Mayall album is available to both his old stalwarts and a new generation of fans.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver ranks to be one of my top 3 favourite Beatles albums. It was very artistic, revolutionary and every track was different.  The album paved the way for several great bands of the 60's and was one of the things that started the late 60's physicadelia.  The album made me love the Beatles more than ever and was also the second album of theirs I bought.<br />The album starts off with TAXMAN an awesome Harrison opener.  Followed by the hit ELEANOR RIGBY and the beautiful I'M ONLY SLEEPING.  Next there is a turn to physicadelia with LOVE YOU TO but heads to the calm HERE THERE AND EVERWHERE.  Next is the novelty hit YELLOW SUBMARINE one I'm not to crazy about but still a classic.  SHE SAID SHE SAID is a a good rocker followed by the entertaining GOOD DAY SUNSHINE then AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING.  Next comes a rather country-like ballad with a horn called FOR NO ONE.  Then another rocker called DR. ROBERT then more Harrison magic with I WANT TO TELL YOU and another great song GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE.  Finally the album finishes with the tripped out TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS.  <br />This album really revolutionized the late 60's musical culture.  It paved the way for a new era of artists and was very diverse!  Some consider this the Beatles best work although with me it is hard to tell because  they made so many great albums.  The album would be followed by the even more revolutionary SGT.PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.  The album is a masterpiece pure and simple it can be puzzling at times but has proven to be the best album of 1966.  If you have not gotten it, get it! You will not be disappointed!  One of their finest without a doubt!
0345440757|1.0|...your child is a mere accessory to your fashion wardrobe and beautiful lifestyle. This book makes an extreme (almost hilariously so)excuse for first-time moms who &quot;can't be bothered&quot; being a mom. I was shocked to read some of the flippant recommendations on how to get your baby to sleep and eating &quot;more regularly&quot; (aka on a convenient schedule). The book is easy to read, but the info is pretty scary. Try another baby book, please, your kid will thank you.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is a great book for all ages. It's stated in the future where everything has changed. Your families are picked for you, there is no more music, or colors. People don't even get to pick their jobs in this weird land. Only one person get's the spiecal gift to live in the past, hold memories of how it used to be, see the colors, hear the wonderful music. Although you may think you want this job once you get it, it might not seem so great anymore. Holding everyones memorys of horor and pain so they don't... not being able to talk with your friends about what you did at work that day. Do you actully want that job? The boy in this story decided he wanted to leave run away and not turn back. Break the bubble scientist had made so that people wouldn't feel anything, no feelings, have any pain or great happyness.
B00003CXSP|5.0|ok, im getting sick and tired of reading bad reviews for &quot;Hannibal&quot;. it was a &quot;dissapointment&quot; here and it was &quot;done poorly&quot; there! My God--it wasn't as bad as everyone (everyone meaning the critics) say it was! What they all lack to say is that sequels are usually never as good as the first.  So, Jodie Foster didn't play the role as Clarice Starling--big DEAL! I actually think it took balls for Julianne Moore to go up there after the Oscar-winning performance Forster gave us in &quot;Silence&quot;. She did VERY well too!  And everyone is sickened by the whole frying brains and eating it. It was in the book, for christ's sake! in a matter of fact, the book went even farther. Clarice ate some of Paul Krendler's brain too. But they couldn't do that in the movie because it would scar Starling's &quot;goodguy&quot; image.  The writers were just following the book. What I don't like is the fact the writers followed the book for &quot;silence&quot; and won an Oscar--5 Oscars! They do the same thing for &quot;Hannibal&quot; and what do they get? Mean reviews saying is was a waist of Sir Hopkin's talent. It really pisses me off!  Now, I will be reasonable; the movie's ending was different from the books and that dissapointed me a little because I wanted the sparks to fly between Lecter and Starling, but I DID like what they did. It does exactly what the first one did--lets U know there's gonna be another sequel.  If I was a movie critic, I would give &quot;Hannibal&quot; % starts, because it was a great film!
0060930187|5.0|It is a very good book. Like I said in the title -- it reminds me of Catcher in the rye but written by a female. I like how witty and introspective the writer is. The part about the mental hospital is more brutal and less entertaining than the part about New York etc. However, overall, the book gave me the experience I have been seeking -- namely to get a feel of what it's like to be a girl (I am a boy myself). Plath is very good at getting precisely at the femaleness of her character. Too bad she didn't get to write her second novel. I am sure it would be something amazing.
0440217563|5.0|This third book in the historical Scottish trilogy by Diana Gabaldon was as riveting and intense as the previous two installments.  I will admit to dragging myself through the first couple hundred pages, however, there were enough interesting and engaging segments in those first chapters to keep the fire of interest alive.<br />The beginning of the book switches back and forth between 1746 in Scotland with Jamie Fraser's post-war life and 1968 in Scotland with Claire, Brianna and Roger Wakefield undertaking the historical search for traces of Jamie Fraser and what might have become of him after the war. <br />Brianna, Jamie's daughter, finds the proof of Jamie's life as a printer in Edinburgh years after the battle at Culloden.  Claire then makes her decision to, once again, step through the Druid stone circle at Craigh na Dun and back into the 18th century to find Jamie.<br />The reunion between Claire and Jamie was everything a reader could ever possibly want in a novel and more.   Ms. Gabaldon anchors the love story with a strong element of believability, regardless of the time-travel aspects of the story.  Claire and Jamie have little time together before being thrown into danger, mystery and mayhem.   Several surprises await the reader with twists and turns that had me commenting a loud to myself!  As the title would indicate, much of the book takes place on a ship as Jamie and Claire are bound for the West Indies in a daring rescue attempt. Several characters from the previous novels reappear, some in ways that are delightful surprises.  Others return in devious deadly plots.<br />Although I have read over 3,000 pages of this story I am not yet tired of it.  The characters of Claire and Jamie are still strong and continue to hold my interest.  This is one of those stories that I do not want to see end for when it does, I will miss Claire and Jamie terribly.  The next book, Drums of Autumn, promises to be perhaps the best of the trilogy.  <br />I most certainlyrecommend this series to readers enjoying adventure, time-travel and romance.  I would, however, recommend beginning with the first book in the series, Outlander, and then reading the second, Dragonfly in Amber.
B00003CXE7|5.0|After watching Gladiator for the third time, I found myself as interested and attentive as I was during the first viewing.  It IS the best movie of the year and next go-around; it will be in the AFI top 100 films of all time.  A top to bottom brilliant movie!
0767849493|5.0|I thought Dogma was, single handidly, the most surreal, funniest and thought-provoking film I have seen in ages. Linda Fiorentino does the greatest performance of her career, Ben and Matt portray very believable characters, Chris Rock, as usual, is funnier than ever, Salma Hayek as a sultry muse does a grade A job, silent Bob and Jay are two of the funniest duos in movie history, Jeneane Garofalo, small role but big laughs-LOVE HER! and of course, the most beautiful, talented, gifted singer of the 90's: Alanis Morissette. SEE THIS MOVIE! YOU'LL LOVE IT.
B00003CXSO|5.0|This is a great show people!  Please don't listen to critics who say it isn't!  Some people just have no 'taste'!   Anyway, Hannibal's great, and Anthony Hopkins is fantastic- AS USUAL!! Oh, and I got to be an extra in it!! And, while I was there I go to meet Mr. Hopkins himself! I just want to say that even though I was acting completely hysterical, he was so sweet to me!  Thank you Mr. Hopkins! I'm determined to meet you again!  Sorry, I just felt like sharing that with you all.
B000021Y74|5.0|This is the greatest film out of Germany- BOTTOM LINE! This film is already making it's way to the top of my favorite films ever list. Franka Potente gives a heart stopping performance as Lola and doesn't stop till the bitter end. Kudos to Tom Twyker, he has done it again. If you havent seen this movie-SEE IT NOW! i promise you, you have never seen a better piece of German Cinema ever! Best movie of the year!
0767805712|4.0|Set in the not-too-distant future, &quot;Gattaca&quot; stars Ethan Hawke as a young man named Vincent who was born to parents who turned down the option for genetic engineering.  As a result, Vincent is born with poor vision and suffers from many illnesses in his youth.  Vincent and others like him who were born without genetic tampering are labelled &quot;in-valid,&quot; making them ineligible for many opportunities in life such as the space program.  Desperate to become a part of space exploration, Vincent finds a sure way into the program after being introduced to the young man Jerome (wonderfully played by Jude Law), who, while not an &quot;in-valid,&quot; is confined to a wheelchair due to an accident.  <br />The whole plot of the film centers on this question:  Will Vincent be able to rise through the program and make it into space before his real identity as an &quot;in-valid&quot; is discovered?  The film is a visual masterpiece.  You almost get the feeling that you're looking inside the mind of one of the writers from science fiction's Golden Age.  The settings remind me of Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; or Kafka's &quot;The Trial.&quot;  You get the sense that you really are in the future, that none of this could exist in the present.  When it comes down to it, the film really uses few special effects.  The ones that are present are not useless eye-candy that most science-fiction films today feature.  The effects are only a backdrop for the story.  (Hear that, Hollywood?  The STORY is what's important!  Sorry...I feel better now!)  The story has several interesting subplots:  Vincent's relationships with Jerome, with his brother, and with a young girl at work played by Uma Thurman.  The murder of the director of the space program and the investigation that follows also brings in an added dimension.  <br />The whole point of the film, stated in very simple terms:  You can live out your dreams even if everything is stacked against you.  To be honest, at first I was bothered that Vincent began to live out his dreams by cheating, but I realized that the conditions set up by the government also cheated.  To deny a person access to any goal or dream based on race, religion, genetics, or any other factor is a cheat from the start.  Vincent was smart enough to figure out a way to realize his dream.  And thankfully someone was smart enough to allow this picture to be made.  You leave the film with a lot to think about.  If science continues to progress at the current astonishing rate, we will be faced with some of the questions raised in &quot;Gattaca&quot; very soon.  Any film that causes you to think (a rarity these days) is well worth your time.
0804106304|4.0|I really enjoyed the Joy Luck Club. The only that was a little confusing was the layout, but besides that it was very well written. You follow four young girls and their moms through their lives and experiences. The four moms grew up in China and the daughters grew up in America. Each share their stories and experiences as a girl. You see the conflicts between the daughters and their mothers as they learn to live in America. Very fascinating and enjoyable stories you won't want to miss. I strongly recommend reading the Joy Luck Club.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This film has been met with some cynicism by film critics; I, for my part, shared that cynical view until I was &quot;talked into&quot; going to it over the weekend. I was wrong. This film and Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon are what I constantly hope for when I plunk down my hard-earned cash. It is not reality nor does it pretend to be; it is good old-fashioned story-telling.    Folks, this is a musical. That simple fact may be what the critics are having a hard time with; when is the last time that they have had to critique a musical. This one is a spactacular,flamboyant, over-the-top finale to the &quot;red-curtain trilogy&quot; by the guy who brought us Strictly Ballroom. The music is an anachronistic blend of pop tunes and period-styled music that serves to lower the watcher/listener into the twilight world of &quot;fin de cicle&quot; France and its decadent underworld. I believe that it accomplishes that.      Suspend your disbelief (as my drama couch would say), and go see this movie; then go out and buy the soundtrack because the music will stay with you for a while. This movie has managed to make some of this music &quot;new&quot; again. It goes beyond being just mass entertainment. Give yourself an escape to a world that might have been, and lose yourself to the music of love.
B000002BMD|4.0|Now, the Manics are known for being quite the rocking rockers, and this album proves that they could rock just as hard and be just as relevant without their fourth member, lyricist/guitarist Richey James. Except this time around they incorporate a number of new instruments into their oeuvre - witness the groovy trumpet solo in &quot;Kevin Carter&quot; - making for a diverse and engaging listen.<br />Now, this album came out after Richey James mysteriously disappeared off the face of the earth, so it makes sense that they should address that topic in some way. They sort of do. About half of the album features Richey's lyrics, and the title track, though unable to explain the event, addresses it: &quot;And if you need an explanation/Then everything must go.&quot; The first half also contains &quot;Kevin Carter&quot; and &quot;Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky&quot;, both penned by Richey, and while the words don't explain Richey's actions, they hint at just how distraught he was. (The former is a tribute of sorts to a journalist who committed suicide because he achieved fame due to a disturbing wartime picture he took in Africa, the latter is a gentle song about animals in a zoo and how oppressed they must feel.) The latter half of the album, while still good, is somehow less moving and less relevant, though after the hellish vision of &quot;Kevin Carter&quot; nigh anything seems less moving.<br />This album rocketed the Manics to mega-big superstar status everywhere except in the US. It's our loss. It's a great album, and proof that the Manics, no matter what happens to them, are hard to break.
6303379214|5.0|This is the best movie in the world.  It's a great romance story and parts of it are hysterical.  I LOVE this movie.
B00004T9VY|5.0|I've played the guitar for nearly thirty years now, and I learned how from Cat Stevens, James Taylor, and Jim Croce (with some help from Lightfoot and Fogelberg and CSN+/-Y and a handful of others). Moreover, name any drug and I probably know someone who has attempted to play &quot;Moonshadow&quot; around a campfire while under the influence of that drug.<br /><br />So it is not at all lightly that I name _Tea for the Tillerman_ as one of my favorite albums of all time, and a much better introduction to Cat Stevens than any of his &quot;greatest hits&quot; collections. He had two absolutely great albums; this is one of them. The other was _Teaser and the Firecat_, and _Mona Bone Jakon_ was darned close. If you have those three, you have most of the &quot;very best of&quot; Cat Stevens already; borrow _Buddha and the Chocolate Box_ from somebody and tape &quot;Sun/C79&quot; and &quot;Oh, Very Young,&quot; and you'll have the rest.<br /><br />(Not that his other stuff isn't _good_, but it's mostly not of the same quality -- though portions of _Catch Bull At Four_ come within inches of it. I don't have much patience with &quot;fans&quot; who tell us that the rest of us aren't &quot;true&quot; fans if we find &quot;Foreigner Suite&quot; to be much ado about nothing and don't especially care for _Izitso_. If we have to suspend our powers of discrimination and uncritically adore everything an artist emits, who wants to be a &quot;true&quot; fan of _anybody_? And what genuine artist would want such &quot;fans&quot;?)<br /><br />I think the quality of _Teaser_ is a bit more evenly distributed than that of _Tea_. But _Tea_ seems to me to hit higher heights. For example, I can take or leave &quot;Miles From Nowhere&quot; -- but &quot;Into White&quot; is probably the most hauntingly gorgeous thing the man ever wrote. (On the &quot;haunting gorgeousness&quot; scale, it's up there with Wendy Waldman's &quot;Mad Mad Me&quot; as recorded by Maria Muldaur on her self-titled debut LP.)<br /><br />He had some hits here, too, of course, but my own favorites aren't the hits. After the aforementioned &quot;Into White,&quot; my personal favorites (in no particular order of favoriteness) are &quot;Sad Lisa,&quot; &quot;But I Might Die Tonight,&quot; and &quot;Longer Boats&quot; (which is indeed, as one reviewer surmised, about UFOs). And one nice feature of the production is that this entire album is recorded with John Ryan on the acoustic bass. That's why there are all those cool growly bits down in the lower register.<br /><br />Anyway, here's a little history for the uninitiated:<br /><br />&quot;Cat Stevens&quot; was the stage name of Steven Georgiou, who was born in the U.K. in 1949 of a Cypriot father and a Swedish mother. Something of a musical prodigy, he released his first two albums well before he was twenty years old as was on his way to becoming a &quot;pop star.&quot; He then fell victim to a terrible case of tuberculosis. When he returned to singing and songwriting, he had taken a decidedly more reflective turn and found himself delivering absolutely beautiful stuff with no apparent commercial potential. That was fine with him; he was no longer particularly interested in commercial success. But, perhaps ironically, his delicate confessional songs and his deliberate avoidance of &quot;commercial-ness&quot; turned him into a huge international star.<br /><br />Well, he eventually (1977) became a Muslim and adopted the name &quot;Yusuf Islam&quot; (after the biblical dream-interpreter Joseph). At that time he also left the music industry. He has since recorded a couple of albums about Islam, but his last collection of commercial music was _Footsteps In The Dark_ (ostensibly a second volume of his &quot;greatest hits,&quot; but in fact a set of lesser-known favorites and a handful of tunes not available elsewhere).<br /><br />You can feel safe in ignoring the comments from people who think he has become &quot;rigid&quot; and/or &quot;intolerant.&quot; The simple fact is that nearly every Cat Stevens album (the exceptions being his first two) are filled with &quot;spiritual seeking,&quot; and he eventually found what he was looking for in Islam. His &quot;recent&quot; (actually, 1990) remarks on Salman Rushdie were not what you probably think they were (and in particular he didn't call for Rushdie's death). He's no more &quot;rigid&quot; or &quot;intolerant&quot; than the rest of us; he's simply a religiously observant Muslim, that's all. There's a problem here only for people who think seekers should never get around to finding, or that traditional religion is more &quot;dogmatic&quot; than irreligion.<br /><br />_Tea_ and _Teaser_ are still great albums, and they don't need to &quot;transcend&quot; their creator in order to be great; there's no need to run down Yusuf in order to elevate Cat. And since these albums _were_ written during his &quot;seeker&quot; stage, they're suitable for everybody -- future Muslims or not.erant.&quot; The simple fact is that nearly every Cat Stevens album (the exceptions being his first two) are filled with &quot;spiritual seeking,&quot; and he eventually found what he was looking for in Islam. His &quot;recent&quot; (actually, 1990) remarks on Salman Rushdie were not what you probably think they were (and in particular he didn't call for Rushdie's death). He's no more &quot;rigid&quot; or &quot;intolerant&quot; than the rest of us; he's simply a religiously observant Muslim, that's all. There's a problem here only for people who think seekers should never get around to finding, or that traditional religion is more &quot;dogmatic&quot; than irreligion.<br /><br />_Tea_ and _Teaser_ are still great albums, and they don't need to &quot;transcend&quot; their creator in order to be great; there's no need to run down Yusuf in order to elevate Cat. And since these albums _were_ written during his &quot;seeker&quot; stage, they're suitable for everybody -- future Muslims or not.
0811826848|5.0|The Beatles Anthology is an excellent read. Although lots of this information is somewhat familiar, it is brillantly linked into a year-by-year analysis of Beatlemania and well described by the Fab Four. The book is quite large and heavy, and therefore, difficult to read in bed (as I did). The only negative criticism I have is that the later years (1967-1970) don't appear to be covered in as much depth as the earlier years (it seems more pages were devoted to the earlier years). One interesting comment:  you can flip to any page and read about their history without needing to read through the chapter first. And, the book gives an excellent understanding as to why they broke up. After reading this, I better understand that Yoko and Linda were just minor players in the break up. It's also sad to see the &quot;boys&quot; (as George Martin refers to them) growing and changing into independent,aging &quot;men&quot; who no longer need the others for support.
6305537798|5.0|i have to recommend this to any one who wants to see teenagers with brains.  one wouldn't think by the title that this movie is special, but it is.  i will admit that i got this movie because i really like heath ledger; however, even if he were not part of the cast, i would still love it.  i enjoyed this film because the dialogue is so mature ( i mean, who uses word like &quot;engorged&quot; or &quot;antiquated&quot; with literal knowledge of their meanings?) and the characters are so realistic.  even the unintelligent ones hae their own ingenuity in at least one aspect.  and the music is fantastic.  i'm not a big rock and roll person, but these songs made me experience the characters' emotions simultaneously with them.  oh, and i can't help but mention how great heath ledger was.  he may be drop-dead gorgeous, but he can also act.  he didn't disappoint me &quot;not even a little bit, not even at all.&quot;
6305078564|5.0|This is my most favourite drama I have ever watched ! I am now a Big Fans of Jane Austen's novel and I just go round and round the bookstore to see if there are any other books by Jane Austen. After watching this, I so curious to know what 's more will happen around Mr and Mrs Darcy . Jennifer Ehle act the best Elizabeth and she is quite beautiful as to fit in the character . Well, buy it and the books . This is the best one among all of the Austen's novels!
B00005B5L4|5.0|Rumours is my favorite album of all time.  Hearing this DVD was BETTER than hearing Rumours for the first time.  I bought a DVD player just so I could hear this DVD!  It would have been well worth the money for &quot;Silver Springs&quot; alone.  My scratchy old 45&quot; pales in comparison to the beautifully haunting version on this production.  The album was remastered especially for DVD, and the sound is absolutely incredible.  I heard sounds and voices that disappear on the album.  The sounds in &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; are chilling. And the harmonies, my God, the harmonies! If &quot;Songbird&quot; doesn't make you cry, you have no heart!  In addition to the songs from the album, there is a &quot;Making Of...&quot; which is pure gold to any Fleetwood Mac Fan. I cannot gush enough.  I'm in love all over again!  Go out and by a DVD player and this DVD.  You won't regret it!
B0000024JA|5.0|This is the best album of Method Man. Mostly it's always so that the first albums of the artists are always the best and by Method Man, it's so. Every song of his &quot;Tical&quot; album is so cool than you can't get enough. And Method Man is popular in America. I think you know about what I'm speaking. Some people out of Wu-Tang helped him with Method Man's &quot;Tical&quot; album, so you can trust me that the album is great or better say perfect. That's why I give &quot;Tical&quot; 5 stars and I can recommend this for a lot of people.
B00000IUT7|4.0|this machine will not go up the hill with more that 3 cars in tow.  you are better off going with the light blue locomotive
B00004XQP4|3.0|Warning isn't bad enough, but it lacks heavier riffs. That is the only problem. After you listened the album carefully, the rhythm, the lyrics, the instruments, they are alright. This album is definitely similar as nimrod, but as i mentioned before the only negative point is the heaviness of the riffs, and one more problem is the song misery, that is a very different style to Green Day, it is not bad but i hope bigger songs from them and i hope them to make Dookie 2 or at least Insomniac 2...<br />Rock on guys...
B00000J2L8|5.0|Everyone is hilarious.  George C. Scott flexes his comedic muscle - but Sellers is right at home.  He plays 3 roles - each one uniquely funny. <br />I laughed so hard, I embarrassed myself...
B000001F84|2.0|The first sounds of the album are enough to make you cringe, if you expect a real progressive-rock experience. Very banal guitar riffs, in the tradition of the worst from late 70s, mixed with bad attempts at techno harmonizing. As a prelude of bad things to come in 80s. As far as alleged &quot;conceptualism&quot; of the album is concerned, it is obvious that the group tried to chew on too ambitious album. Way over their heads. And not the best application of Lee's falceto vocals. Rush is much better at small unassuming form. If I had to compare their work on this album with other bands, I would say they remind me of some unfortunate hybrid of Yes and Squeeze in sound, and in the musical attitude the album is akin to Journey of Foreigner. Yak! Actually, in my book, the worst characteristic for a group, is when they can easily be compared with other bands. Not the best work of Rush. Maybe it was breakthrough in their own musical development, but not the best listening material. Skip it. Trust me, you won't keep this CD in your CD changer if it holds less than 50 CDs.
0792833236|5.0|The direction is flawless.  De Niro IS Jake La Motta in this movie.<br />Filmed in beautiful black and white.  The dialogue is razor-sharp.  Hence, there is a wonderful undertow to the movie:<br />The relationship between Jake and Joey is amazing - so believable and absorbing.  So many famous scenes, you can't count them all.<br />Has been copied so many times, you find yourself seeing Raging Bull in so many other movies.
6303460151|1.0|When &quot;plot-less&quot; movies come out now and then; Woody Allen's &quot;Radio Days&quot;, or Fellini's &quot;Amarcord&quot; some of these films work (like the two I mentioned) but some don't. When you make a career out of making films like that, like Altman has, your films usually become hit or miss. Movies that are structured like this can be praised or criticized for the same reasons. Either you can enjoy some of the bits, like the acting between certain people, and think some scenes work and some didn't, but you still enjoyed yourself. Or the other way to look at it is; you didn't like the fact that there's no central charcaters, no real relationship between the viewer and the actors involved. And, it doesn't feel &quot;complete&quot;.  Now, I'm not a really big fan of Altman's. I'm just starting to get into his films. Some of his movies work like &quot;M.A.S.H&quot;, and &quot;The Player&quot;, and the more recent &quot;Dr. T &amp; The Women&quot;. Others don't work as well such as &quot;Popeye&quot;, what was he thinking!! And this film. The real problems with this movie are the fact that number one it carries no energy. It just lags around, trying to pick up some steam only it never does. The characters are not real at all, but, I'll excuse that because after all this is a comedy. Are the characters in &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; or &quot;Scary Movie&quot; real? No! The movie takes on more that it could handled. There were certain things that only could of made this film work. Like the whole story involving Rupert Everett (Jack Lowenthal) selling his mother's Anouk Aimee (Simone Lowenthal) fashion company. They could of been negotiating and Simone doesn't like what she's hearing and starts yelling as loud as she could while the models are on the runway. That could of been funny. But no time is paid to that part of the story. It's one scene. In one short scene they talk about it, and we never hear them mention it again. Then there was the fashion editors who wanted to get a photographer. They could of worked a lot more on this part of the movie. Or the stuff involving Sophia Loren (Isabella da la Fontaine), Marcello Mastroianni (Sergio) and Jean-Pierre Cassel (Oliver de la Fontaine) if they would of work it so what happens, happens while the show is going on, that could of been interesting also. But the script by Altman and Barbara Shulgasser barely touches these themes. Too many scenes don't work, it just becomes boring after a while. For older movie fans, try to remember those all-star cast movies of the 60's. Where there wasn't really a plot, but, it was all just an excuse to get a bunch of famous people in a movie, think about &quot;What's New Pussycat&quot; or &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. That's sorta what this movie is like, without the laughs. We see a lot of famous people like Kim Basinger, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Terri Garr, Danny Aiello, Tracey Ullman, Sally Kellerman, Lyle Lovett(Why is he even in this?  lol), Forest Whitaker and Laren Bacall(!). And if you were to ask me why. I wouldn't be able to answer you, there're just there to be there. The movie also has a score by Michel Legrand (Watch What Happens, What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?). Really bad movie by Altman, truly one of the worst movies of the year it came out.who wanted to get a photographer. They could of worked a lot more on this part of the movie.

B000002HRE|2.0|Usually I like Metallica. Kill 'Em All was average but some catchy stuff. Ride The Lightning was like the non-rap Rage Against The Machine. Somehow it was better than the debut. Master of Puppets has what isn't in these &quot;Load/Reload&quot; eras, POWER CHORDS. ...AND Justice For All was a classic, in fact, my favorite Metallica album. The Black Album was pretty good with some standout tracks, but thats where I saw it go downhill. Load was alright but kinda boring. NOw we're into the so-called metal version.<br />Well, here's MY breakdown of each track: 1. Fuel-- WHat I wish Reload could be like. It was heavy but not poseur or cliche. It also was powerful with Hetfield's vocals, Hammett's guitars, and even more, Newsted's bass. I even heard the drum energy. We know this was a hit single. 5/5<br />2. The Memory Remains-- SOmehow, this is also a standout track from Reload. It had that awesome guest vocalist even though it was a slower song. 4/5<br />3. The Devil's Dance-- I got nowhere into listening and never liked this one. It is very boring. It isn't even memorable. 1.5/5<br />4. The Unforgiven II-- Great follow-up to the other Unforgiven, more inspiring than the rest of the album. 4.5/5<br />5. Better Than You-- Only song that I like not released to radio on this album. It's also my favorite, even though it gets repetitive. You just gotta listen because my description brings you nowhere. 5.5/5<br />6. Slither-- Not bad. Also not the best song on this album. It will allow you to fall asleep ya know. 2.5/5<br />7. Carpe Diem Baby-- Alright track. It's like the last good song on ReLoad. But good '80s style-type metal. 3/5<br />8. Bad Seed-- Bad track. I wasn't able to listen to it all the way through. Just as unforgettable as the rest of the album. 1/5<br />9. Where The Wild Things Are-- Not bad, but just wasn't my thing. 2.5/5<br />10. Prince Charming-- If could have been good but just as memorable as the album itself. 2/5<br />Then, it hits rock bottom! two 0 songs and Fixxxer is a ballad that I don't really enjoy. If you want good ballads try Gravity Kills' &quot;Belief (To Rust)&quot;. Also you could try good melodics like Stabbing Westward. I just somehow didn't get the touch of ReLoad.
B00003CWL6|3.0|about this film is either a) its openness to, or maybe naked appropriation of, the gestures and preoccupations of avant-garde film or b) the fact that you could view American Beauty as the most expensive piece of teen porn produced in 1999. Not only do you get the nice visual haiku of the spinning trash, which halts all narrative motion--a sin in Hollywood film--but the director actually exploits both young girls. Stripping two teens is a B picture coup if I've ever seen one (no different, I'm sure, than sitting through a screening of &quot;Masked Avenger Vs. Ultra Villain in the Lair of the Naked Bikini,&quot; also released in 99). So you get both, high art and low. Of course the high art moment is rendered with garbage and the trash-movie scenes are accomplished through use of the nude. Go figure. This is postmodernism, after all.
0790734400|4.0|this is a spoof!!!!!!!!!!ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CHEESY AND STUPID AND WIERD!!!!!!!!this movie is hilarious!!!!!!if you understand all the stuff in it, its very very funny.i agree with the mystery science 3000 guy
B00005BJ2O|4.0|First of all, the movie rocks and the music in it is just fantastic.  Wonderful blend of pop, rock and modern musical with a touch of the drama of the classic opera.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are surprisingly fantastic.<br />  However, the soundtrack is incomplete.  The songs are all remixes of what you hear in the movie, which are fun, but they drop a lot of the cool stuff unique to the movie.  (i.e. Lady Marmalade is the version you can get everywhere and not the one with Harold Zidler's voice over)  The other problem is it's missing a lot of great songs (&quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;) aren't even on it.  Many of the songs that are sung several times in the movie in different ways (&quot;Come What May&quot;, &quot;Fly Away&quot;) are on the CD in an attempt of a mix, but again, you loose a lot of cool moments.<br />  Overall, the CD was fun, but it would be nice to be able to get one complete with the movie version of the songs and all the reprises.
6303122647|5.0|TNBC is most likely the most intelligent and creative display of imagination ever caught on film. tim burton pulled off this strange tale beautifully, using both animation and creativity to set the backround and forefront for his epic masterpiece.the main character, jacks feelings and words describe pain, sorrow, need, anger, wonder, and happiness.i strongly suggest buying or renting this movie as soon as possible if you havent already done so.its a classic
6302636779|5.0|I have a copy of this movie that I taped from a TV broadcast and am awaiting the opportunity to see it in DVD with it's widescreen format and all the extras that this medium can offer. I think it was one of the best Audrey Hepburn movies that I ever saw. I'm not Catholic but after seeing this movie I often wondered if I would ever have the fortitude and be worthy enough to become one. Even though dated in it's presentation of the rigors of becoming a nun it was an inspiration to those who feel the call. Selflessness and service are commodities not often seen these days.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie will knock your socks off!  My face was smiling and my heart was singing throughout the entire film.  What a wild ride of amazing color, music, and cinematography!  GO see this film and be absolutely delighted!
B00005B36H|5.0|Well, what can I say? , I got this album about 6 days ago, and it just grows on me by the minute. One thing I adore about this album is the instrumental bits in it, I mean come on, when was the last time you heard a good instrumental rock song...<br />In my opinion instrumental numbers are the true test an artist goes through, cause it's more difficult to express your thoughts by music than by words. A good instrumental gives you the feeling that no song could ever give you, you could reach a point that you know the name of the song with out reading the sleeve, you could just SENSE it.<br />This album has the best (if not only) good instrumental numbers I've heard since Metallica's &quot;To Live is to Die&quot; (that was in 1988) or since the work of the late Pink Floyds whome I think were uncomparable when it comes to instrumentals songs... The Lyrics are haunting, obsessing that will need a lot of thinking to figure out, my favorites currently are &quot;the patient&quot;, &quot;Schism&quot; (it's Lyrics are really beatifull) and my favorite of all &quot;Reflection&quot;...As you can see I am more into their slower stuff than the much heavier &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot;...<br />If I'm gonna compare it to their previous works, I think Undertow was a mere display of musical tallent but was lyrically shallow and not as deep as their next albums.. As for Ænima, well that's kind of tricky, I think Lateralus is generally wiser and more mature but it will always lack a &quot;46 and 2&quot; in it, I think excluding that, Lateralus would have a larger number of nice songs....
B000059XUI|2.0|The movie is ok, but without 5.1 or DTS, this movie loses 2 stars from me, would have been 4/5.
0380788624|3.0|If you are interested in mathematics, crytography, or computers you should find this book interesting.  Also, if you just want to get an idea of how the mathematical mind works this would be a good book to read.  After finishing the book I can say that I am satisfied, but I'm not planning on reading any more books by Stephenson.  <br />This book is long.  Not because it is 900+ pages, but because it doesn't really get going until page 600.  The novel shifts between a number of different story lines and I found it hard to keep interested in them all until they began to fall together toward the end.  Most of the male characters blend together in that they speak and think the same way.  As for the female characters, we get more insight into the life of a piece of Captain Crunch cereal than the life of one of the cardboard-cutout women in this book.
B00003CXP1|1.0|This would have to be the sickest most depressing movie I have ever seen.  A movie supposedly to show the dark side of drugs, instead it shows the dark side of life: a life without hope, or purpose full of dissapointment and illusion.  There is never any reason to make a movie of this nature nor is there to watch it unless you want to witness a merciless destruction of hope and the human sprit.  This movie will leave you depressed and wondering what would ever inspire a sicotic producer to produce such a film.
0152023984|5.0|This wonderful story, with its profound lessons on life, is like a gentle old friend to me.  I first read it as a child, despite my father's warning that some of its subtleties might have to wait until I was older.  This happened in another world, another language.  Later, as a teenager, I was surprised to learn that in America The Little Prince was considered to be a children's book.  Out of curiosity, I read the book again ... I smiled to remember my father's comment.  Over the years I have read this little gem of wisdom again and again and again.  At my wedding, the judge read the passage in which the little prince returns to the rose garden, only to discover how special and unique his own rose is.  As for the taming of the fox, I know of no other instance in literature which captures the true nature of friendship quite like this.  This wise little fox keeps hanging around my life... Surely, no child can truly understand &quot;And now here is my secret, a very simple secret:  It is only with the heart that one can see rightly;  what is essential is invisible to the eye.&quot; And yet, aren't the lessons in The Little Prince precisely what most of us really want to teach our children?  Perhaps these very important lessons take a whole lifetime to learn...  My husband and I have read The Little Prince to our daughter on several occasions.  And that cunning friend fox keeps getting into our conversations.  Can it be that he is now helping me raise my own daughter?  You bet.
6303418287|4.0|I don't know about you people but this was a pretty good movie but some flaws.The film was too fast I mean the camera would not stand still and it made the film seem soo fast it was like you put it in and then it was over just like that even though the film is 123 minutes.The love scene was just like any other scene in the film it seemed like Victor was on a schedule or something.Make monster,go back home greet family,go face creature,get married and make love to her.The film should have taken its time it should have had long moments just like in Bram Stoker's Dracula in which this film is a companion with.It should have had long slow more talky moments the film should have been longer it was all too quick.The score is very good too.Maby Kenneth Branagh should have just directed it and not played Victor as well I don't know.The film is good and bad its good on the outside but if you pay attention to the film itself its got quite a bit of poorness to it,but beside all that theres also lots of neat things to look at this also is one of the very very extremely few Frankenstein films that stays true to Shelley's original novel I mean the very first 1931 Frankenstein film was really not at all true to the novel at all,but this one is just like Bram Stoker's Dracula in which this one is produced by Dracula's director Francis Ford Coppola.This movie reminds me of Exorcist 2 The Heretic cause in that film they had all the best people to help make it and great actors but it didn't come out well somehow but it wasn't terrible.Anyway costumes are good sets are good and the Oscar nominated make-up is terrific.Anyway this is a pretty good film inspite all of the negative things that come along with,but its good none the less so see it you might actually like it.

B00005ATQI|5.0|This movie is very scary it scared and still does scare the ____ out of me my gosh.What I wanna know is why there isn't a soundtrack on album and why the hell wasn't this film nominated for anything? that still raises a big question.Anyway the performances are excellent and so is everything else.Highly recommended.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica is a fantastic band; they rock.  <br />With hard-drivin' riffs, heavy music, heavy lyrics...they can mesmirize you and become your master.  They can make you feel what they want you to feel.  <br />They have a gift.  In every song you can find something about real life...something that you can feel and relate to.<br />Metallica will continue to be my favorite band forever...
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are a perfect match for this album. Both actors can hold a tune with the reworked songs and definatley carry the various songs meanings. The characters they portray in the film are believeable and not sappy! Ewan singing his version of &quot;Don't Leave Me this Way&quot; by Thelma Houston and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; version by Whitney are truly funny and done very well (go see the movie to find out why)! Try and guess and name the songs he sings during the Elephant Medley! The Elephant Medley is a perfect example of the films creativity and wit (the infamous reworking of Madonna's &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; is also hilarious)!  Nicole's solo of &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; is haunting and hypnotic. She conveys the message of her character Satine to the audience very well. Possible Oscar/Golden Globe nomination for next year maybe! Her voice is soft and has meaning. A full blowout by a some popular DIVA would detract from the films/sountrack's meaning and make it too cheezy and Hollywood-ish. Nicole sings in a way that shows her character is vulnerable to the world, powerful, and believeable. And yes they do sing FOR REAL on the album. Personally as a non-musical lover (i.e. Broadway) I was truly amazed and in awe of thier talents. Mind you I mostly listen to Hip-Hop/R&amp;B and was dragged to go see the film of the same name. I am glad I did. The Moulin Rouge album is a perfect example of how music in general can be interwoven to tell a full tale. If you buy the album, you MUST go see the movie in order to appreciate the full talents from Nicole and Ewan. Otherwise you will be dissapointed and think Nicole can't sing. Go and see the movie to see how the songs on the soundtrack are used in the film. The new &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; version does appear in the movie as there is a major dance number to it (there is even a brief dance remix in the film). But don't buy the album just for this song. Moulin Rouge sets the standards for film musicals and film Hip Operas (i.e. Beyonce and MTV's CARMEN) to follow! This is a new trend no doubt!
0553208845|5.0|This book tells the life story of Siddhartha and of his childhood friend, Govinda.  Siddhartha, a brahmin (the highest caste), leaves his home in search of happiness, nirvana, enlightenment, peace...you name it.  Through the book you'll go through his up and downs, learn what he learns, and travel on his search for peace of mind.  To read this book and not get a lesson from it is next to impossible.  I reccomend this book to everyone.

0553573403|5.0|I read alot, and this is one of the best books Ive come across in a long time. The storyline in this book in awsome, and the charators are great, after reading for awhile you feel like you really know them. There are a few things that might turn off some readers, somtimes the story drags a bit, but you usually find that in most books, the other thing that may offend some people is the amount of sexual content in the book, I personally dont think its to bad myself. Other than that this is a great book. I think anyone who is looking for a good book to get lost in, this is the book for you.

B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow was the best movie I've ever seen.  I rented it for three days and watched it seven times. Val Kilmer is very funny as Madmardigan and Warwick Davis is amazing as Willow. It has action, adventure, and magic. You have to watch it!
B00003CXN4|5.0|Traffic is without a doubt--the best movie released in 2000(maybe tied with The Way Of The Gun). It's epic in scope, but small when it comes to the action on screen. Traffic focuses on 3 main plots with 1 sub plot. Each one more than capable of carrying the movie. I won't go into details of the plot though. The film is told thru many ways. The gritty, dirty feel of Tijuana, the icy cold Cincinatti, and the sun bleached San Diego are all represented with expert-like usage of filters and pacing. Tijuana is fast moving and with very little down time. Concinatti is paced a bit slow, but with lots of surprises. San Diego is relaxed and the editing is smooth. The actors all turn in great performances, rarely does an ensemble cast do this great of work. Benicio Del Toro is just outstanding as Javier Rodriguez. Michael Douglas seems a bit tepid during some scenes, but is overall damn good. Catherine Zeta Jones is a capable actress and it shows. What really deserves recongition is Luiz Guzman and Don Cheadle. Incredible actors that worked together with PT Anderson on Boogie Nights and their chemistry on screen is amazing. Watching this movie isn't a movie experience. It's more like these characters let a camera guy film their lives.<br />As a dvd though it's horrible. No extras to speak of. Just a few trailers. This movie deserves a Fight Club presentation on dvd.\<br />What happens in the movie isn't really a shock. Some might even feel a bit let down about what happens. It's all part of Steven Soderbergh's game. You can try your damnest to stop the drug trade, but you'll rarely put in a dent. Theres parts with Michael Douglas' character near the end dealing with his freebase lovin' daughter feels too hollywood. An uncanny movie that was jipped at the oscars.
B00003CXRM|5.0|It's funny.  OBWAT gigs the dark side, buffering the viewer with humour against the uncomfortable, unpleasant radical old southern south.  Clooney stood out, in my opinion, as good in this role as his 'dusk til dawn' role was ill suited to him.<br />I think you should buy it.  The music is a real enjoyable part of the experience as well.
0790729725|5.0|. anyone who is a fan of great ciinema, must also be a fan of this film. this is a true masterpiece. there is no doubt in my mind that the wonderful characters from the sopranos were influence by this masterpiece. this is as good as the godfather, and is true epic filmaking, at its very best. this movie deserved best picture over the ... known as dances with wolves, and probably best pest picture of the 90s.
B000059R8Y|2.0|The thrill must be gone. This CD is Long, oh so very long.  Don't get me wrong he is still a great Guitar player, and there is some good music on here, but it seems as though pre-retirement has begun.  I must say his vocals have goten very good. As far as the Cd as a hole goes the word Lethargic comes to mind. I have been a fan for years and I am 40 years old so when I say lethargic it must be. I have watched or I should heard his music go up and down over the years, this one is a down.  It would be good background music but to sit down and listen to it is a challenge. Oh by the way you may notice that I never mention the name Eric Clapton, that is because this review can double for the latest Mark Knopfler CD, word for word.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee has done such a fantastic job bringing to life the Finches, the town of Maycomb and boogie men--real and imagined--that one feels a little like graduation when the final page is turned.  For this reader, the most emotional part of this terrific, terrific piece of work comes as Atticus is leaving the courtroom after Tom Robinson's guilty verdict. The reverend for the black community whispers to Scout, &quot;Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passing.&quot;  How many of us would hope that our life's work would command such respect? Standing on the Radley porch at the novel's closing moments, Scout gives a stirring retrospect of the last three years--she had never seen her town from this angle before and so, sees her life in a different perspective with one season giving way to another: Autumn again and Boo's children needed him.
079283318X|4.0|Financially, the most successful and in most peoples eyes the best ever; this Bond probably wont ever be matched. There was a tremendous build up to this movie; after a 6 year break in the series I thought that 007 was dead and was way past its sell by date. Only by drastically overhauling 007 would it ever survive; and boy, did it get modified.<br />Goldeneye exploded onto the screen with a new Bond, new cast, new music, new style, new (well, old) cars and, new watch. Everything was totally fresh and bang up to date, bustling with modern technology - computers, space weapons and The Internet; a funky electro soundtrack and domineering women.<br />What about the story? Cleaver. Cataclysmic space based weapon hijacked with the aid of a hi-tech helicopter and a computer programmer. The culprit? 006, James Bond's ex partner who was presumed dead. The cast? World class. Judi Dench plays M, like a strict head mistress (mmm). Robbie Coltrane brings us his acting magic as a comical Russian gangster and tough guy Sean Bean is 006. The actors who play Ourumov and Mishkin are world class too and of course the babes are legendary.<br />Brosnan? He is only good in GoldenEye, because he looks tense and serious, which is the way a spy should be, and he brings an air of vulnerability and realism with it, but a few times he tries to be funny and he just fails miserably and he is a little wimpy.<br />There are some good action scenes in this movie, like Bond being chased in his `60's Austin Martin by Xenia in a convertible Ferrari, but the main action scene, where a tank chases a car through St Petersburg is a waste of time. I would much rather have seen a decent car-chase, e.g. with the Ferrari and Bond driving something a bit more modern, like his new Z3, that only gets about a 20 second part.<br />I could go on for ever, saying I would change this, that or the other, but, for an all round James Bond movie this one stands out from the crowd by being refreshingly different, more refined than any other, and is probably the best Bond ever; so good in fact that it would have been a worthy ending to the series. God Save The Queen.
0671027344|2.0|the perks of being a wallflower..hmm ok i found this book to be very depressing. i agree with what Leslie from Spokane had to say about it. Is the author trying to be cyncial here? i mean Charlie has OLDER friends, he smokes, does drugs,and gets kissed.(fresh year!) nope, don't think he's a wallflower. Oh yeah, he's smart too. The end was a complete suprise because he hadn't talked about his Aunt Helen and he just went into a trance while he was with Sam? didn't understand that. I didn't get what he was in the mental hospital for. His whole family treats him like he's amnaeic or something! He also phrases things weird. He doesn't sound like he's very depressed, i don't believe it. A friend recommended this, but i will not pass this book on.
B00005B36H|5.0|Like others have said before, it takes a little while to get into. The reason, i think, is because of how talented the band is. They can change the songs sound every minute and it will be great, not many bands can do this. I never, in my wildest dreams, thought that they could outdo aenima but they did. Aenima is probably one of my top five albums of all time, now including lateralus. GO BUY IT!
B00003CXSP|4.0|I was a little disappointed with the movie adaptation of the book. I think they left out some very crucial elements from the book that should have been left in the movie. Despite the poor adaptation from the book I still really enjoyed the movie alot. This movies is not Silence of the Lambs and in now way does it pretend to be. This movies has a whole different style story to tell. I think the first movie was more Good v.s. Evil where in Hannibal all the characters other than Agent Starling are all evil in their own ways. I thought the movie was very enjoyable. I would give it 5 stars if I had not read the book, but only 3 to 4 since I read the book first. The movie is good by itself but the book was far superior.
0385335482|5.0|I loved this book about a struggling journalist with a obsession for shopping.  It was satisfying in every way a book should be.  It's a great light summer weekend read. No deep underlying tones.  No sexual promiscuity. (Well, not too much.) Just a simple humorous story guaranteed to make anyone feel better about their own shopping spurlges.
B00000K31V|2.0|this movie is poor-bad acting, disgusting scenes and very little believable. Leigh's character in particular is very annoying. try Strange Days instead.

0679879269|3.0|It would be churlish to knock \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" too hard as literature. After all, whatever its faults, it is the finale of one of the best pieces of fiction writing for half a century. And yet even as I draft this review, I am undecided whether to give this final volume four or three stars. <br />Taking the trilogy as a whole, \\"His Dark Materials\\" is a throwback to the days when fantasy writing could stand up as serious literature and still be enjoyed by young readers. In fact in many ways it's better than either the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"Gormenghast\\". Its characters are better drawn and more likeable, it touches on the real-life obsessions of adolescence in a way that would have been taboo in the days of Tolkien or Peake, and it's written in better prose than either of them. What's more, most of the individual elements that made \\"Northern Lights\\" and \\"The Subtle Knife\\" real five-star material are to be found in abundance in \\"The Amber Spyglass\\": superbly paced narrative, glowing descriptive passages, characters who come to life, a wealth of poignant incidents - in fact the very final scenes are among the finest in the entire trilogy. <br />So where does it go wrong? I want to suggest three fundamental errors of judgement that spoil what could have been truly great:<br />1). The monster is made of papier-mache. We've all seen sci-fi/horror films where the early atmosphere of threat and mystery is spoilt when a creaky monster made of wire and papier-mache lumbers onto the set ten minutes from the end. That's what we have here. When the great and fearful gods who have been manipulating human events from an unimaginable other-world of light and darkness finally lumber on, it is all too much like \\"The Trollenberg Terror\\" or the little man behind the curtain in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". <br />2). The setting is out of touch with real life. The strength of the early volumes was that their fantasy elements were rooted in a world we could all recognise as a dark, twisted, sardonic reflection of our own. Sadly, as the trilogy progresses and the background becomes more and more fantastical, the author seems to get carried away with dreaming up bizarre new world-scapes and to lose the thread of his story. What seem at first sight to be interesting new plot threads are often unceremoniously dumped as soon as they have served their immediate purpose, and few of them are developed satisfyingly. A good example is Mary's prophesied (but never quite fulfilled) role as a temptress comparable to the serpent in the Garden of Eden. More seriously, the cosmology of \\"Dust\\" is used as a pretext for most of the important plot developments, but in the end it turns out to be little more than a \\"McGuffin\\" - that's the name the film industry gives to the sort of wondrous but unexplained gadget/formula/secret that is a pretext for the action in every secret agent film you ever saw . In the end, it is easy for the reader to get into a \\"so what?\\" frame of mind. <br />3). The most serious flaw in \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" is that the author follows a personal agenda to the point of spoiling the story for others. Tolkien worked for years on the ethnology of Middle Earth before writing the \\"The Lord of The Rings\\", but his philosophical ideas were never allowed to get in the way of a good story (at least, not until Silmarillion, etc.) In contrast, Pullman seems determined to share his rather disturbing personal theology with us, to the point where Lyra's story sometimes seems like an unwelcome distraction. Ideas about the nature of God and the place of mankind in the universe that are no more than undercurrents in the earlier volumes are here brought out into the open, with key characters sometimes almost spouting sermons. Christian, Jewish or Moslem parents may find the distortion of their shared spiritual heritage and the parodying of established religion particularly distasteful. There is a right time for people to grapple with the nature of sin and grace, butit's not through dime-store metaphysics a children's novel intended to be read as entertainment.<br />In the end, the first two volumes could be recommended to almost anyone over the age of 12, provided they have a strong stomach and they or their parents do not object to the unhelpful spiritual input. And once you've read the first two, you'll want to read the conclusion. But to me it was a disappointment.
B00004Z400|4.0|If you wanna be closed-minded and call them nu-metal, the Deftones are one of the most unique, eclectic and passionate nu-metal bands out there.  My main problem with metal in general is that it's so miserable - the lyrics are so rife with pain (usually contrived) and self-pity that it's almost desensitizing.  You stop caring about the lyrics because the same themes pop up every 30 seconds.  And that's why White Pony is such a welcome breath of fresh air; not that they aren't angry (check out 'Korea', 'Elite'), but it's just great to hear a so-called 'heavy' band show their sensitive side so naturally and confidently ('Passenger', 'RX Queen').  Here are some thoughts on each individual song:<br />Back To School - 8/10 - a slightly conventional but very catchy tune.  The only tune not found on the 'grey' White Pony, but worth several listens.<br />Feiticeira - 9.5/10 - possibly the best tune on the CD.  Very unique rhythmic and melodic structure.  This tune never seems to get old.<br />Digital Bath - 8.5/10 - another excellently crafted tune; nice haunting atmosphere and very impressive vocal range from Chino.<br />Elite - 6/10 - probably the tune that most closely resembles old-school Deftones.  Good for fans of the first 2 albums, but not really a step up from the works of other bands.<br />RX Queen - 8/10 - still has a chance to be a single.  The syncopated beats and electronic textures work in the song's favour, although the lyrics are a tad pretentious.<br />Street Carp - 4.5/10 - not up to par.  Chorus is somewhat catchy, but overall insignificant.<br />Teenager - 9/10 - the biggest surprise on the CD.  Never thought the Deftones would write this song, and that's partly why it works so well.  Love the textures.<br />Knife Prty - 9.5/10 - the must-hear track of the CD.  The imagery of the lyrics is wonderfully gothic, and the female in the background is a complete trip.<br />Korea - 8/10 - another track suited for old-school fans.  The guitar sounds a bit like Korn, but Chino's screams have an edge that most others can't match.<br />Passenger - 7/10 - a fan favourite, thanks mostly to Maynard's incredible voice, but the song itself is a bit slow-moving and musically pretty standard.  The piano at the end is a gorgeous touch though.<br />Change - 8.5/10 - the song EVERYBODY has heard by now.  It has that bombastic 'arena-rock' charm that would go over well at a live show.<br />Pink Maggit - 9/10 - another personal favourite of mine.  The chorus is basically a slowed down version of 'Mini-Maggit', but I prefer it in the less radio-friendly horror-movie context presented here.<br />Overall - 8.0/10
B000002H33|5.0|America had an Iron Maiden in the 1980s. The band was called Metallica. This album was the album that defined Metallica. A culmination of musical effort and songwriting still unsurpassed in thrash metal. That album was Master of Puppets. From the opening acoustic chords of Battery to the final pounding fury of Damage Inc. this album will take you on a ride faster than lightning. This is Metallica at their creative and technical best. The rhythm/lead guitar duo of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet will set your speakers aflame. Hetfield's raspy scream has never held as much power as it did on this album. Lars Ulrich consistent percussive pounding never sounded better and the American bassmaster himself, Cliff Burton provides us with the pounding and melodic foundation. Of all the songs on this album, the best is definitely Orion. In it we see all sides of Metallica from the hard rocking opening, a bluesy and melodic middle and, of course a pounding outro. Other songs to look for are Master of Puppets and Welcome Home (Sanitarium). Unfortunately, Metallica never again cteated a masterpiece as Cliff Burton was killed when the tour bus flipped over in between venues. But this album lives on. All true Metallica fans should have this and all looking at getting into them should get this album first. I also recomend Ride the Lightning and Kill 'em All.   Just call their name and you will scream Master!!
B00000IQBL|5.0|I've seen Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, and the Thin Red Line, among other war movies. AN had some good scenes, but the end was missing something. SPR had a superb beginning and end, but the middle was boring. TRL was just a mindless, boring movie. As for Full Metal Jacket, I was glad to see that all parts of the film are equally good. There may be some lag, but not much. The first part of the film deals with a very-neglected aspect of the military--boot camp. From what I've heard it's a little exaggerated. It's a movie, so what? It's never been so much fun watching someone get yelled at. All those witty jokes. Then there's the end of boot camp, which was very shocking. After that, the movie snaps to Vietnam. So what if there's no transition? Some people complain about not enough action. There's plenty of it, believe me. Any more shooting and they'd have to call it Rambo in Vietnam. The last part with the sniper was very well done, pitting the soldiers against a serious problem that required some thinking before letting the muscle take over. I might add that it was comical in a very dark way. Highly recommend this film.
B00004YW6I|4.0|I have three or four PJ Harvey CDs, and my favorite one is Is This Desire?, which is widely hailed as her worst.  The others I frankly just didn't get.<br />This one, though, I do.  Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea is haunting, engaging, and passionate.  The songs make you feel her pain, her lust, her love.  They transport you to the city, then take you back to the sea.  It's wonderful music, plain and simple - just what I expect in a good rock album.<br />Harvey rocks.  There's a reason why this CD was on all the 'unsung heroes' lists of 2000 - it's great.  Pick it up - you won't regret it!

B00005BJ2O|4.0|Prior to Moulin Rogue I didn't know there was a series of film called &quot;red curtain&quot; where, moulin rouge is the third of said series.  The first being ROMEO+JULIET and the second one STRICTLY BALLROOM.<br />I found the music to Moulin Rouge pretty eclectic, fresh and inventive.  Though the film itself is set in the late 1800's, the music they used on the film is undoubtebly 70's,  Very brave, very wise, very visionary.  How else could you have made a movie where most of the people can understand the lyrics of the songs their singing.  I mean, these are songs you grew up on.<br />Noteworthy tracks include FatboySlim's can can song, Lady Marmalade, and nicole doing someday I'll fly away.  Critics don't get me wrong, it is not amazing that she can sing, its amazing that she is able to.  Just for that is worth the price of admission.<br />I can't wait to see the film if it lives up to the music.

B000002UUX|5.0|I know this review is pointless, but I love this album! Dave Mustaine's snarl and Marty Frediman's eastern-tingled solos make this album worthwhile. But Dave's bass and Nick's pounding drums help too. The first 3 songs are worth the price alone. But, then comes in the excellent &quot;5 Magics.&quot; The only song out of place is &quot;Poison Was The Cure&quot; It sounds too much like Diamond Head. But, as in a lot of metal songs, the solo makes it worthwhile. Too bad it's short. Also there is the very-good-but-short song called &quot;Lucretia.&quot; there is also one really good song &quot;Tornado of Souls&quot; Dave's singing is ok, however. &quot;Rust In Peace/Polaris&quot; is the last highlight, with riffs galore. Megadeth has shown their true talent in thrash metal. ROCK ON! VIC FOR PRESIDENT!
B00005BL2A|1.0|Depeche Mode has always been on my favourites list, and (probably) always will be.  But, on this dismally boring release, they've stretched my allegiance to the absolute limit.  I have read all about how they have exorcised their personal demons and are all \\"clean and sober\\" (they say) now.  I glad for them.  But, c'mon guys!  Let's focus on the music now.  To call this album boring would be an insult to other boring albums.  I really like the first single \\"Dream On\\" and purchased the cd-single.  Do yourself a favor and only purchase singles from this album.  Luckily, I found this cd in a used bin (already!) yesterday ... or I may have been more annoyed.  The only other uptempo song is \\"I Feel Loved\\" which I also like.  I'm sure that some of the other songs are pretty and a few others are not bad on their own, but listening to the whole cd at once is mind-numbingly BORING.  The production is impeccable, of course, but that doesn't save this cd. Unfortunately, before I heard this cd, I purchased $60 tickets to see their concert in Chicago.  I only hope that they play some older stuff and that Poe gets us going as the opening act.  Otherwise, it's going to [be bad].  Like I said, I'll remain a fan, but take it from me:  give this one a miss.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I agree with everyone else about how wonderful this film is, and I am truly sorry that Mr. San Fran didn't see the same.  It is a very rare occasion indeed, when I can exit a theater and be entirely satisfied with what I have just seen.  Moulin Rouge did just that for me.  How could you NOT like this piece?  The acting is fabulous (of course), the cinematography is fantastic, and the music: VERY moving, and surprisingly phenomenally done!  I have since recommended it to everyone I know who enjoys movies, just as much as myself...In fact, tonight I am going to go see it for a second time!  Go out, and experience it on the &quot;big screen&quot;; you will NOT be disappointed
B000059XUI|5.0|this movie is excellent! very adorable and funny. one of my favorites! christopher reeve is a flawless gorgeous man and is great in this movie especially in those tights! the love story between him and lois is wonderful. superman really truly is super!! :oP
B00004Y6O9|5.0|What can I say.  From top to bottom, this is one of the greatest rock albums out there.  It is also my second favorite VH album(behind Fair Warning).  What does this CD have, you ask?  In a nutshell...Loads of hits, Innovative(for it's time) guitar playing, and great writing; all complimented by the classic Screaming Vocals and Cool-to-be-cocky attitude of the one and only, &quot;Diamond Dave&quot; a.k.a David Lee Roth!  Check this baby out!  I promise you won't regret it!

B00003CXE7|2.0|So, whom was I supposed to be rooting for? Russell Crowe's character was essentially a killing machine, first as a tool for the expansionist Roman empire and then for a slave owner and blood-thirsty Romans. After the guy and his soldiers slaughter a bunch of overmatched barbarians, I'm supposed to feel sympathy for him? I mean, it would be like cheering for Gen. Custer after one of his rampages against Indians. This is kind of a problem with Ridley Scott movies (most of which I like). You can't really get too involved with characters like Decker in Blade Runner or Sigourney Weaver's character in Alien. But you can appreciate the special effects and cinematography. And you can do that with Gladiator. Which is good because you can't figure out some of the plot and you don't really care. It's also at least 30 minutes too long. I've seen all five of the 2000 Best Picture nominees. This one was better than Chocolat. The other three, particularly Crouching Tiger, were far more worthy.
0375704027|5.0|A chance snatch of Beatles muzak heard in an aeroplane throws Toru back two decades, to the time when he was a student torn between two very different women. <br />One, Naoko, is the gentle, beautiful girlfriend of his best friend who previously committed suicide; and the other, Midori, is an impulsive, slightly eccentric classmate who enjoys cooking and talking about sex.<br />Many opposite poles exert their power in this novel: the living and the dead; the past and the present; youth and maturity; resilience and disintegration; tender love and casual sex; swinging 1960's student Tokyo and the sequestered serenity of a health sanatorium in the mountains. <br />By the end of the novel, the narrator has taken the reader to the point where, like himself, one can no longer keep these elements separate from one another -  life revolves around death, love exists through loneliness, and the past constantly imbues the present with all its hues and shadows.<br />This may smack of sombre profundity, but it is a novel that ultimately belongs to the optimistic resilience of the young and alive. The pathos is mixed with gentle humour.<br />If you are already familiar with the work of Murakami, I can just tell you that this novel has the same staggering brilliance of his other works; and if you're new to his writing, well, I can't do justice to how good it is, so you'll just have to go and read it for yourself.<br />I in fact give this book six stars: <br />* * * * * *                       <br />(F, 26)

If you want to here a real funk artist, blow you out the water with the baddest funk hooks you ever danced and grooved to, Madonna check out The Bride of All Thangs Funky,  Dawn Silva on amazon.com  Link this ladie up with the other Diva's, SILVA's funk will blow them all out the water!!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I laughed, I cried, it was much better than... well, any movie in recent memory. <br />Moulin Rouge is wonderful fantasy, a movie that knows it's a movie and uses all of its tools to best effect. As compared to other movies, which are often nothing more than plays captured with cameras. The director of Moulin Rouge speeds up the film, dazzles with fancy editing, tosses up special effects, and uses a complete motion picture pallete to create a truly moving, exhilirating experience.<br />I've read some high falootin' critics complain that the movie has a thin plot, or is unrealistic. Ummm... Moulin Rouge is a *musical*. The Sound of Music wasn't exactly Shakespeare. Cats is more than a little fantastical. These poor fools missed the entire point of the movie; they should just sit back, open their eyes, ears, and hearts, and be entertained by a movie that had my audience laughing, groaning, sighing, clapping, and weeping. And smooching. After all, Moulin Rouge is a movie about, above all, Love.<br />A special aside to couples: this is a TERRIFIC date movie. If you don't have your arm aroung your dear one throughout this movie, you should get that heart jump-started at the ER before you completely stiffen up.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|American Woman got my attention.  Lenny needs to do more in that style.  Rock is my thang got that turbo power energy flowing through that heavy metal, energizing all in its path.  Mix some funk in that equasion and you come up with Hits all day.  I recently purchased another monster CD from amazon.com from a artist named Dawn Silva and I find she has a rock cut on her joint that is similar to Lenny's American Woman.  Love to see what chemistry them 2 would have on a screaming funk/rock venue in the Islands...  Nice work Lenny........
0156421178|5.0|The author's first-hand experience of the egalitarian society created by genuine anarchists in Spain's Civil War, and the valiant efforts to protect it against all kinds of fascism, is a useful counterpoint to the offhand references in American media to \\"anarchists\\" as irrational and immature thugs. I suggest that you find and read this book immediately. ...
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Baz Luhrmann (director of Romeo and Juliet, and Strictly Ballroom) has the most amazing sense of tragicomedy. Just when you think you can't cry anymore, there is something funny that will break the tension. When the movie was over, both my brother and I sat and watched all the credits because we had to come back to where we were. From the first note you are drawn in and feel like you are part of the Moulin Rouge. The characters were perfect! I don't think I have ever seen a better performance from Nicole Kidman or Ewan MacGregor. Not only am I going to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD, but I will go back and see it again in the theater. A must see!
B00003CXDZ|2.0|Several adjectives come to mind when watching this movie; from brilliant and beautiful, to annoying and stupid. Baz Luhrman needs to... make up his mind. Does he want to make beautiful movies that unfold like a series of brilliant moving photographs, or does he want to make infantile drivel where he can use painful close-ups, pointless fast motion film, and tacked on sound effects that would make the producers of America's Funniest Home Videos blush? I just hate having to subject myself to the latter to get to the former. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are both great. They somehow manage to maintain some dignity despite some the [junk] they are asked to do, say, and sing. If I were to rate it only on cinematography or art direction, I would give it an A+. This is a beautiful, train wreck of a movie. And though not everyone dies, the casualties are high.
B00005B36H|5.0|The great:  Nearly everything about this album is excellent and mind-bending.  No other rock band around today can challenge the listener intellectually and musically like Tool can.  All the elements of a great Tool album are here.  My favorite moments of the album are (in chronological order):  The middle section of The Grudge.  In The Patient, \\"I must keep reminding myself of this...\\" and the guitar part that then mirrors that melody...outstanding.  Parabol into Parabola just kicks [butt] in every way.  Disposition, as it has been said, is truly Tool at its prettiest.  Beautiful little song.  Lateralus and Reflection are two songs that are both uplifting and challenging.  As an artistic production, these are the two finest songs on the album.<br />The not-as-great:  Ticks and Leaches is my least favorite song on the record, although it is still very good and I never skip it on the CD.  My only other complaint would be the way the CD ends.  I would feel only slightly more satisfied if Lateralus or Reflection ended the record instead of Triad (very good instrumental) and Faaip De Oiad (a voice on a call-in show talking about aliens and the government, with the only music being the sound of an amp (or something) slowly exploding.  Both are cool tracks, but, nitpicky as I am, I would have rathered them somewhere earlier on the album.<br />On the whole, this is unparalleled by anyone anywhere.  This is the album of the year.  Unquestionably.
B000008HPE|5.0|Fore! from Huey Lewis and the news was one of the first albums I have ever owned, I listened to this album all the time and it was an easy album to listen to.  Every song on this album is great, the album started with the big hit &quot;Stuck With You&quot;, just one of their big hits, but then there is &quot;Hip To Be Square&quot;, probably my favorite song of Huey Lewis, but &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot;, &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; and &quot;Doin' It All For My Baby&quot; are all excellent songs, all five songs that were released hit the top 10. But this album is great as a whole, back in 1986, this was just one of the albums I would listen to non-stop, this is a very enjoyable album, and probably my favorite Huey Lewis album, although &quot;Small World&quot; and &quot;Hard At Play&quot; come awfully close.  This is just one of those albums you put in and just let it play. Huey Lewis is an artist that should have never gone away and I only hope there is a comeback down the line somewhere for this excellent band.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|A truly fantastic soundtrack. Baz Luhrman is perfecting his style and vision for the future of celluloid by leaps and bounds with his third movie, Moulin Rouge. Kidman and McGregor (especially McGregor) are astounding with their musical talent. Each song expresses a wide range of emotions and recalls the stunning visuals of the movie itself. <br />If you are under 21, you probably shouldn't waste your money because the only song you'll be interested in is Lady Marmalade, go buy the single. If you are over 21 you will love this soundtrack.
B00001R3HX|5.0|What can I say?  It frustrates me that I cannot use words to evoke the pure joy I receive from this most brilliant and genius of bands!<br />My only wish here is that I could mandate that all people buy all that is Porcupine Tree.  This is truly one of the most exceptional bands to ever have grouped -- and, of course, that essentially states that Steve Wilson is one of the most purest of musical geniuses to have roamed this planet.<br />I grew up loving Pink Floyd, (old) Genesis, Yes, King Crimson, ELP, and came to acquire a taste and love for Radiohead and Live in more recent times.  The sum total of all these aforementioned bands = the most incredible joy and moving musical experiences I could have ever dreamed of.  If that aforementioned list is all there was, then I would still be quite content.  I have experienced so much delight in the amazing genius of their musics.  <br />However, even though I have been quite satisfied with the great songs and epics of that list of fabulous bands, I have to admit that I was never so blown away as when I first discovered Porcupine Tree.<br />Pick up this disc, along with everything else by Porcupine Tree, and you will suffer from repeatedly burned-out cd players as a result of overuse.
B00003CX8I|5.0|This was an absolutely incredible movie.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan make a magnificent pair as the friends who are on opposing sides of a conflict.  Hugh Jackman breaks through amazingly as the gruff Wolverine. Famke Janssen, James Marsden, and Halle Berry round out the X-Men as Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Storm respectively.  Anna Paquin plays a young Rogue; which is one of my few beefs with the movie.  Having Rogue as a teen works with the movie, but is totally out of sync with the comics.<br />Other characters who surfaced as teens included: Shadowcat, Iceman, Pyro, Jubilee, Cannonball and Colossus.  I also believe that Nightcrawler and Beast made an appearance, although both looked basically normal, so I could be wrong.<br />The villians were Toad (played by Ray Park Jr.), Sabretooth, and Mystique (played by supermodel Rebecca Romijn-Stamos).  Senator Kelly also played a large part in the film.<br />The plot worked well, the actors were incredible, and I am so looking forward to a sequel.
B0000069CT|5.0|I fully agree with other reviewers regarding the beauty of all three of Bruch's violin concertos. However, my personal favorite of the works on this set is the Scottish Fantasy which is a violin concerto in all but name. The title of this gorgeous work is based on the fact that it contains variations on several Scottish folk songs. Whether you are familiar with Max Bruch's beautiful, romantic violin concertos -- including the sublime Scottish Fantasy -- or not, please do yourself a favor and buy this wonderful bargain set.
0451450523|5.0|I remember watching the movie as a child, although I only recalled a few images when I got the book.  The book revived my memories, especially of the Red Bull. The Last Unicorn has an interesting cast of characters and a mood that is somewhat different from other fantasy, yet hard to explain. This is definitely a book that can be re-read.
0060900075|1.0|I was disappointed with &quot;Doors of Perception.&quot; I was expecting something insightful. Instead, this book was all theoretical with comparisons to art. I had no idea what Huxley's point was.
0780020685|5.0|This is the best film of Akira Kurosawa and the best film ever made. Citizen Kane is as good as this movie, but cannot make you feel the same emotion. The history of the cinema never was the same after Seven Samurais.
0452282195|5.0|It is the story of a young girl who wanted more then anything to have blue eyes.  She yearns to have the feelings of the all-American blonde haired blue eyed white girl who has a priveledged life.  Pecola, who is a poor, homely black girl living with her parents in the south.  This story is of the nightmare at the heart of her yearning and the tragedy of its fulfillment.  <br />I loved this book.  I recommend it for females over the age of  13.  It will touch your heart and make you feel sympathy for the characters.  You will get to know them so well, and you will feel their pain, suffering, and cherish the moments with them.  You will want to help them perservere and triumph over the rough times.  Please, take my word for it, this is a great book that everyone should experience.
B000002OX5|5.0|Notice how most reviewers love the album they're reviewing? I was prepared to dismiss the encomia about this album, but it was so insistent that I decided to give The Who Sell Out a try. Well, the glowing reviews were right.<br /><br />Here are other some things you should know to help you decide whether to buy it. 1. The song writing is very strong. The album holds up under repeated listenings. The reviewer who said he could leave it playing all day was right about that. 2. The liner notes are very generous and informative, really adding to your understanding of how the album took shape. Who fans may want to buy it just to read the liner notes. 3. The bonus tracks are not like the alternate takes that add clutter at the end of other reissues but rather, as the liner notes indicate, strong and compatible takes that would have made a fine double LP if only there were such a thing in 1967. I enjoy Melancholia, Glittering Girl, the beaty Jaguar. There are no bad cuts. It really hangs together as an album. 4. Keith Moon's drumming is exhilarating in a way that the synthesizers and drum machines of most rap and pop music today cannot match. With hindsight, Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience seems to have been imitating Keith Moon, but Mitchell always had Noel Redding to help him return to the beat. If you keep this music playing in the background you may, like me, sometimes find yourself stopping and listening in astonishment to Keith Moon's drumming.<br />The Who Sell Out is really lots of fun, great music, and a great value for your entertainment dollar. If you are trying to decide whether to buy it, buy it.
0452277752|3.0|I think that the best way to characterize these books would be to look at the reviews.  People who have liked these books have also generally appreciated books like 'Salem's Lot--I take this to mean that these people have very little taste for the finer points of literature and are after only a story (which Lot still didn't provide very well--King misplaced some of his characters and abadoned a promising start, but that's for another review).  If that's what you're in search of, you should be adequately satisfied here.  As these books progress along a timeline, the presence of a story begins to become more and more evident.  But, let's go one by one.<br />Rage:  By most standards, this book is really quite bad.  It's obvious with it's point and decidedly unrealistic in its depiction of the students, their reactions, and the school system in general.  King occasionally departs from reality even further in an attempt to make a point, as with Charlie's interchange with his psychiatrist.  Overall, though, I found this story engrossing for reasons that I can't quite explain.  I took an interest in Charlie, perhaps because I had a similar adolescence, and so I cannot call this book a complete failure, though it is a decidedly sophomoric entry.<br />The Long Walk:  Another obvious effort to get a point across.  Both of these first two books were written before Carrie, so my conclusion is that King was probably naive enough at this point to think that an author deliberately went about inserting his message into his work.  Perhaps he read Atlas Shrugged one too many times (a feat like that is difficult to duplicate).  The analogy between the Walk and life is obvious, but still entertaining, and the story maintains a consistent pace and interest.  At this point, the books are getting better.<br />Roadwork:  The best in the collection, by my standards.  King still tries to make a point in this one, but he does so with a realistic character (at least at first blush) and a muchlighter hand.  Contrary to some reviewers, I found this story to be engrossing and entertaining, despite the fact that it was the only one of these books that I didn't read in a single sitting.  King's natural talent for creating characters that the audience can relate to and feel for shines through in this book, and I'd recommend it even outside of the collection, though it is a little too mired in the environment and conditions of the late seventies for some younger readers to relate to.<br />The Running Man:  Here there is an abrupt dip in the message factor of the book (something that King admits to himself in the introduction).  This is a story, plain and simple--there's no overtones to be had, just pure science fiction.  As &quot;just a story&quot; the book is okay--it's decidedly predictable, and there's nothing new here for anybody who has even a passing familiarity with this sort of book (the apocalyptic, social control dystopia book), but it still manages to be entertaining in the fashion that most King books do.  This is a book that most authors would not have written--I think that almost anybody else would have written it as a short story--but it still manages some entertainment value.<br />Overall:  This certainly isn't the best work King ever did, primarily because Bachman died before he finished developing as an author.  Some of the books are decidedly sophomoric, but most King fans shouldn't be too disappointed.  For the casual reader, I'd say that this is a great book to pick up for an air trip or a lazy afternoon if you can find it (due to issues with the Columbine shooting, Rage, and The Bachman Books as a corollary, have been taken out of publication), but it isn't what you'd call &quot;serious reading.&quot;
0812589041|5.0|I filmed several scenes from Ender's Game with a group of about five people for an English class assignment.  One of the aspects of the book that helped us do the assignment and that improved its overall quality was the dialogue before each chapter between two of the people at the Battle School.  Their discussions of Ender's emerging violence added to Ender's own thoughts. Another part of the book that I liked was the dual storyline with the main story of Ender at Battle School and a secondary story of Peter and Valentine with Earth politics.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Every movie I see George Clooney in, I start to like the guy a little more.  Forgetting his work in Batman, he has truly put out some good work lately, like in Out of Sight and Three Kings.  But everyone in this movie has a good to great performance.  You do not need to know the story of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; to enjoy this movie, either, as it is a good &quot;on the run&quot; type of movie, packed with plenty of comedy.  It also features an all-star cast, even Jimmy James from Newsradio (the tv show) makes an appearance.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, buy the DVD.  It's well worth it.

B00004X0Q0|5.0|When I first heard this album, my first exposure to the band, I loved the music but hated the guys voice. Now with only a few more listens, the voice is the main reason I cannot stop listening. It's what makes it like nothing I've ever heard, sonic and soaring, yet warm and sincere.<br />Crawls under you skin, and lives there.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Ok, all you love birds, if you are all looking for a movie to see this is the one. Just saw it yesterday and ot was the best. The music the effects and the plot are all magnificent. The music itself was superb. The mixing of Marilyn Monroe's &quot;Diamonds are a girls best friend&quot; with Madonna's &quot;Material Girl&quot; was the best. This is a movie that I would see again. Now a word of advice for all of you that cry at movies, TAKE SOME TISSUE you will need it.
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna is truly a legend.  She has outlasted so many different stages of her career, and each development has worked for her.  That said, listening to this CD is like a journey through her works.  There are so many huge hits on this CD!<br />1) Holiday - This wasn't, as many people believe, her first single (Her 1st was Everybody) but it was her first hit.  It broke through onto mainstream, and was one of the first dance pop recordings.  It is fun, with a very catchy chorus.  <br />2) Lucky Star - Although Holiday was a pretty big success, this was flat out huge.  Once again, the chorus is catchy and is on the fun side.  However, it's also more mature than Holiday.  While Holiday was light sounding dance pop, Lucky Star has more funk, and the drums are much more evident.<br />3) Borderline - Another huge hit.  This one is more on the midtempo side.  It is very comparable to Holiday in sound, although it was a bigger hit as a single.<br />4) Like A Virgin - This was from Madonna's second album, and she definately matured.  With lyrics like &quot;Like a virgin/touched for the very first time&quot;, it was a bit controversial for the time, but still spawned massive airplay and sales.<br />5) Material Girl - Yet another huge single, but I don't really like this one for some reason.  Her voice sounds very strange during the chorus.<br />6) Crazy For You - Madonna's first ballad released as a single.  It was very popular.  The song is beautiful, and while Madonna's vocals aren't especially strong, they still sound very good on this track.<br />7) Into The Groove - Beware.  One listen and you will be hooked for life.  &quot;And you can dance/for inspiration/so come on/I'm waiting&quot;  And with those words the song starts into the funkiest dance track of them all.  Madonna has never made any song that is catchier than this.  You will be humming this everywhere.<br />8) Live To Tell - This song marks the beginning of the tracks from her third album.  This is a slow song,but it's not exactly a ballad.  The instrumental opening to this song is very cool.<br />9) Papa Don't Preach - This showed even more growth from Madonna as an artist.  This definately ranks up there as one of my all time favorite Madonna songs.  The classical intro into the danceable funk works so well.  This song is basically about Madonna telling her father she will keep her lover, who her father despises.  A great song.<br />10) Open Your Heart - Although this song fared very well as a single, I still can't see anything significant about this.  True, the video was controversial at the time, but this is a pretty mediocre track with nothing groundbreaking.<br />11) La Isla Bonita - A great Spanish flair made this track a runaway hit.  With lyrics like &quot;Tropical the island breeze/all of nature wild and free/this is where I long to be&quot;, the song gave you pictures of an island paradise.  Another one of my favorite recordings by her.<br />12) Like A Prayer - Watch out fans of the original.  This is a completely remixed version that is very different from the first.  That said, I actually like this one more!  It is more danceable, and just sounds overall better.<br />13) Express Yourself - This is another new version, but once again it sounds even better than the original.<br />14) Cherish - This was a very sweet and romantic love song.  It was another mega hit, and the lyrics are well thought out.<br />15) Vogue - This isn't as strikingly different as the changes made to Like A Prayer, but they are definately there.  They made this song more danceable on the album, and for the third time, it sounds better.  It is a very stylish song, but doesn't sound as good without the video.<br />The next two songs are bonus tracks.<br />True, the Immaculate Collection has remixed some of the songs, added dance backgrounds and cut some off early, but it is still a great collection of classic hits that no Madonna fan should be without.  And even though it's missing a few hits, it still has enough powerful material to keep you satisfied.
6305609721|5.0|Charming entry in the Star Trek series sees our heroes \\"sling-shot\\" back to mid 1980's that they might capture humpback whales in order to save the future. It must've been a slow day. Nimoy's turn as the dis-conbobulated Spock is witty and amusing. Kelly is at his acerbic best...re Spock, \\"He's not operating on all thrusters you know!\\". For once, all the leads get some time to shine. Obviously Shatner had little to do with this production. His role is staid and predictable...some might even say \\"delightful\\". This fish-out-of-water story is noteworthy for its understated plea to rescue the environment from our own greed. There is a sharp babe. That always helps. But the meat and potatoes lie in its reverence to the Star Trek universe as configured by Mr. Roddenberry. Ofcourse its very predictable, good triumphs again. Whats wrong with that. Lambasting critics of the film seem to forget that the Star Trek series is supposed to feel good. My children love it, and so do I. I love them. I love you.PEACE!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoyed the film. The CD only gets four stars because its missing some essential songs from the film--to whit: Broadbent/Roxburgh doing Like a Virgin. [I can't believe this was left off the CD] Broadbent/Kidman/Company doing The Show Must Go On [Ditto] Company doing Spectacular Venacular (??not sure of name). And most inexplicably the CD doesn't have the McGregor/Kidman/Company reprise of Come What May/Children of the Revolution that ends the movie.<br />Additional Issues: The opening number is a bit screwy. Has a different  version. The movie had a fabulous Lady Marmalade/Smells like Teen Spirit Mix--the CD just has Lady Marmalade. CD has Bowie instead of Leguizamo doing Nature Boy (Bowie does a very good job...and in other circumstances I wouldn't mind).
B00005BJ2O|4.0|First off, tremendous movie! I tend to hate musicals, but this was fresh and super fun from moment one. Looking at this soundtrack a couple weeks before I saw the movie, I was a bit concerned over the inclusion of so much Ewan and Nicole numbers, yet, these have become some of my favorite songs on the disc. Everyone will be suprised with the complete talents of both Kidman and McGregor, both have great voices as well as super acting skills. <br />Now for the rest of the tunes... The Fatboy Slim number is a fun, almost cheesy kind of scorcher, but done well. Both tracks from Bowie are simply great, although the Massive Attack boys do little in the way of improving on the first one . The Rufus Wainwright song is great and gives a very &quot;French&quot; feel to the latter half of the CD. Beck's and Bono's glam era covers are pretty good too, but really pale to the originals. The Hindu Diamond Song is a really cool number, full of samples and great beats that one might reconize from the previews. Most of these songs have a very catchy quality to them, obviously this is achieved pretty easily when you already know the tune.<br />The one blemish is the truely awful Lady Marm-o-Lard remake. This song was totally done to move units to the uneducated listener. Completely over-done with 3 note surfing queens and an un-talented rapper. Top 40 corporate pop at it's worst. Skip this one song and your left with a great soundtrack from a great movie.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Ohh my, I love this album soo much!  I have to admit that I did not like the new album much when I first heard it.  It is very different from their other albums, having a slower more melodic sound in many of the songs.  Speiluhr and Zwitter are my two favoritea, but the rest are just as good.  I wonder if all the songs link together in some way because the similarity in lyrics throught the album.  I don't speak German but with a translation program have found many similarities.  Lyrics about a small child can be found in many songs.  The song Speiluhr is about a dead child that lives from the grave through the music of a play clock.  Or so I think (?).  The next song is about riders which was discused in Speiluhr.  I don't know if there is any connection, but I find it very interesting.  The words heart and child are found over and over and lots of lyrics about sadness and pain. I wish I knew the answers!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Words cannot adequately describe the visual effects of this movie.  Spectacular!  The Matrix looks like a kindergarden project compared to Moulin Rouge.  The costumes were stunning and very well done.  The songs are beyond belief!  My sides are still sore from laughing at the rendition of the famous Madonna song!  Ewan has an incredible singing voice that had my heart thumping at times.  Nicole Kidman is gorgeous.  It was halfway through the film before I realized that I was watching Nicole and not Ann Margeret!<br />Definitely a must see film!  This is one of the few movies that must be seen on a big screen.  I can't imagine this movie having the impact that it does on a home tv.
B00003CXB2|5.0|The film (1962) is older than me (1964). I saw it once, when I was a little boy and there were movies with intermission. I believe most of you never went into sucha a session. Those days things were still done for the idea behind it, which was not necessarilly a commercial idea. It never came out of my mind. Lawrence of Arabia is the movie that best represents this obssession for doing it the way it should be done. Anyone on his/hers 25/30 years should at least watch this movie. There's no computer graphics, everything is REAL. Special Effects meant opening a hole in the sand, putting two guys inside to hold an actor who was supposed to die in a &quot;moving sand&quot;. The rest is acting, writing, doing and doing it again until it felt perfect. Movies like this doesn't &quot;happen&quot; anymore. In my opinion, it is David Lean's best picture. Guess why Spielberg loves it.   The DVD is up to the movie. Perfect image, good sound, thanks in part to Spielberg for the restoration. Many extras and making ofs to satisfy your curiosity and see the efforts done to produce such an amazing piece of entertainment for the eyes, the mind and the soul. Buy it with your eyes closed. They'll be pleased to not blink for about three hours.
0792839625|1.0|But, this film can't compare to the play for even a nano-second. The casting choices are tepid, and baffling, starting with the uninspired choice of one of the thoroughly forgettable Landers sisters as Val. (I don't remember which one, Judy?  Audrey?  they both seem like the same person to me.) If you ask me, the key to Val is that she acts like a ...-kitten, but inside she is as insecure as the rest of us.  Judy/Audrey plays her, wrongly like a cross between a Marilyn Monroe character, and a Jane Mansfield character... with none of their charm or considerable acting abilities.  Others aren't so bad & I believe a few of  them were actually pulled from the then Broadway cast. But the actor who plays Al is ALL over the place, and underplays where he should be straightforward. I don't have any memory of the actress who played Christine; Morales blew, Gregg Burge is a total queen, and I don't really remember the other's. I thought Cassie was fine, but hated the fact that the poignant \\"What I Did For Love\\", a touching tribute to dancers who have given everything they have to give out of passion, was turned into a dopey torch song.  (Making it an ode to a relationship that probably should have ended anyways...)  The deletion of the \\"Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen\\" montage was nonsensical and dumb.<br />  The artlessly filmed finale demonstrates how the play and film version differ.  In the play, the finale is at once the whole casts moment of glory, and debatable moment of tragedy.  After you've spent the two hours prior meeting these wonderful individuals, is it a triumph or tragedy that they're all dressed the same and dancing the same steps in same number, in the background of the \\"Star\\" night after night after night?  Stripped of their individuality?  Of course, it's a little of both, but mostly its a triumph.<br />Not in the films finale though. They toss hats, spin hats, peek-a-boo with hats, and about a thousand other dancers come out of nowhere and for no particular reason.  I cannot help thinking that during the filming, or in production meetings, some producer or studio head said \\"Make the last number extra-splashy!!!!!!\\"<br />The point, and beauty of \\"A Chorus Line\\" was that it was theater \\"verite.\\"  We are all present at this audition, during the joyous moments and the uncomfortable ones.  I have never understood who O.K.d this script.<br />Please wait until a Broadway touring company rolls through your town.  This stink bomb is two hours of your life you'll never get back.rticular reason.

B000002LK1|5.0|I have to say that this is still my favorite DM CD.  It is one of the shortest and it has prominent guitars, but it also has some of the best song writing that the band has ever done.  Every piece of music on this CD is perfection (the sweetest perfection).<br />I highly recommend this CD for people who think they wouldn't like DM.  I know a lot of metal/punk people (myself included) who really see how great this CD is once they let go of their DM preconceptions.<br />Everyone should have this music!
B0000027RL|5.0|Ok.  When reviewing Pearl Jam a lot of you tend to compare them with Nirvana, and the rest of you insist on calling them sellouts.  Let's look at the facts.  Ten is one of the best selling albums of all time.  It is because it is one of the most musically astounding albums ever made.  There isn't anything wrong with this.  Pearl Jam didn't sellout and they shouldn't be compared to Nirvana or any band.  Is everyone who makes a great rock album that sells a lot of money considered a sellout?  So does this mean they should strive for mediocrity just so they don't sell out?  Pearl Jam is a great band who makes great music.  They are artists and that's how they should be treated.  Ten is a great album.  It was a classic from the day it came out.  Instead of bashing success we should all learn to open our minds a little and embrace it.  More power to them for creating a classic rock &amp; roll album.  Hopefully more bands can follow this example.
B00004YA66|5.0|Obviously, I liked this movie. It is just the sort of movie I like, actually. I like time travel (we went to \\"Back To the Future\\" the night it opened), I like good acting (I come from NY, and Dennis Quaid did an incredible job of portraying a Queens/everyman fireman--the accent was perfect and the attachment to his family was, well, the way it is...), and I like intense plots.<br />I want you to see it twice because you will miss a few things the first time, unless you are REALLY REALLY smart and REALLY REALLY quick.  Just a few odds and ends that will make it even more enjoyable the second time.<br />Then I want you to see it again because it could, just possibly become one of \\"your\\" movies...I am considering making it one of mine. If it falls into this category, it will achieve a special status I only reserve for a few movies that make me cosy when I watch them, the way some people read the same books over and over. I know it's hard to imagine a movie like this, with violence and fires and fierce interludes making a person feel cosy, but hey, I think at least some of you  will \\"get\\" what I am trying to say.
B000051S44|1.0|Well, so I expected a story with the famous race as a background.  Wrong, no plot, and probably less than 5 minutes of dialogue in the entire movie ( if you don't count the background Le Mans announcer, incongruously speaking English).  Now, maybe a documentary about the race would be OK; but this movie did not have either the continuity or the information content of a documentary.  Just endless clips of cars buzzing around, punctuated by the occasional crash.  The only place in the movie I was curious -- when Steve McQueen's character ended up behind a  non- racing regular driver going about 30 mph (why was this car on the road?) they did not answer.
0783242808|5.0|Face it, this might be a guy's movie (the humor goes that way), but Alyson Hannigan has the two funniest lines in this movie and one of them is a line she improved during rehersals.  She steals scenes in this movie the same way she does on Buffy all the time.  About time somebody gave her a starring role in a film, because based on what she did in &quot;American Pie&quot; imagine what she can do with an entire movie.  <br />Oh, the other neat thing about this movie is that all the guys who are watching it and all excited because its about a bunch of guys trying to get laid, sure have something new to think by the end of this film.  Unless they are total morons, of course.
B000002UUX|5.0|This is by far megadeths best effort.A complete albumn that slaps you right across the face from begining to end.There are 9 great trax on this CD each one in my oppinion is a Megadeth classic.The Cleanist Megadeth production to date ...I almost want to consider producer Mike Clink a 5th band Member (yes it is that good)...This is a must have for Metal fans and for music fans in general....you will love it.
B000002H6C|5.0|easiley Metallicas best album.  every song is great.  Harvestor of Sorrow is my favorite song.  The beginning riff is sweet.  They need to go into the studio and re-record this because I'd love to here it in digital.
B000056K04|2.0|After eight years of being a devote Dave Matthews fan, their release of Everyday now makes me wonder what the band is all about. The band has changed their style of music is this CD to something that tries to be more mainstream. The ironic part is they were probably the most popular band in the world before they sold out. People appreciated their unique style and their incredible talent. I remember their concerts would sell out in upstate New York in less than two hours every time. They haven't sold out a single concert on their current tour and tickets have been on sale for well over a month. This is especially alarming since the tour is right after their new release, a time when fans are usually most excited about concerts. They used to be a band where every member was equally important and celebrated for their unique abilities, now they are just a band trying to make it on TRL. Go to their website and you'll see what I mean. Their real fans realize this change and are turned away by it. The CD consists of short, unsophisticated songs in which the violin and saxophone are rarely heard from. There are absolutely no parts on the CD where the band just jams without lyrics, one of the things that DMB is known for. The most disappointing part is that Everyday was not supposed to be DMB's next CD. They had another CD already recorded and set to release when the band had a change of heart and threw the album out. They then fired their producer who had been with them through all of their accomplishments and hired a new one. Dave then co-wrote Everyday with this new producer in little over a week, and the haste shows. The CD they threw out is superior to Everyday and contains everything that there is to love about DMB. You can find the songs on any mp3 search engine including Napster and Bearshare. Use the former producer's name, Steve Lillywhite, in the search. The songs you will hear are incredible and I can't understand why DMB would throw them out and settle for the ones on Everyday. I can only be optimistic that they will recover and their next CD will be like the DMB I know and love.
0553579908|5.0|This is the second book in the series 'a song of fire and ice'.  It is an epic fantasy similar in genre to Robert Jordan books.  However, it does not drag in places as the Jordan books tend to.  In addition, Martin is a gutsy writer who has no fear in killing off main characters.  If you like long involved books with lots of characters and plots, then buy this one and you'll be happy you did.  Make sure to read book one first. Enjoy!
B000002H6C|5.0|And Justice for all is one of the Best Rock &amp; Roll Albumns ever recorded.From the opening intro to Blackened  to the Crushing ending to Dyers eve,EVERY song is a Metallica classic.There are no Dull Moments on this record.The production is very clean,and crisp.and as a bonus you get the best CD cover ever designed.If you are looking for Heavy Metal in its purest form...this is the CD for you.
B000003BDJ|3.0|Way back in 1976, Decca UK asked critic Roy Carr to put together a 2LP compilation of the best of the Stones' output for the label. Carr came up with Rolled Gold, an amazing 30-track, 90-minute long set that provided a clear, comprehensive guide to the band's achievements during the years 1963-1969. Man, was it good. Needless to say, this isn't that album. Record company greed and the complicated web of legal intrigue surrounding the Rolling Stones' 1960s recordings dictates that we get this 1972 US compilation instead: skimpy on running time, with variable sound at best, and missing so many important hits and milestones that they had to put together *another* 2LP set to get them all in. If your interest in the Stones runs to just wanting the 'hits', then this might do (although it's outrageous that they're still marketing this as a 2CD set when, with a little squeezing, it could fit onto one). If you're a fan who happens to believe that the band recorded some of the best rock of all time during their first decade, you can only mourn a lost opportunity. Surely *someone* at ABKCO/London/Decca/Universal must be able to compile a worthy collection that tells us the Stones story in detail (and actually USES the CD's playing time)? The music deserves five stars; the compilation one; so I've gone for the middle ground.
6303159966|5.0|&quot;Cujo&quot; is definitely a good horror movie. Has good suspense, authentically frightening, and is a very good example of how this adaptation of King's novel has an impact on its viewers/readers.<br />First, a woman with marital problems along with her toddler-age boy are trapped in their car for about 1 day and a night, with their -use-to-be-lovable-St. Bernard into a bloodthirsty killer. Has a predictable happy ending, but nevertheless it holds true to the story.<br />This and other King's novels are a very good example of King's creativity of horror, like &quot;The Shining&quot; and &quot;Carrie&quot; (King's first novel.). But also, King has a different side of story-telling, like touching books (&quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;; &quot;The Green Mile&quot;) made into very good (and award-winning) movies. This proves that he is destined to go down in movie/book history as a famous author of well-defined books of horror and dramas.  Let's just hope that the movie adaptation of &quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot; starring Anthony Hopkins will be equally as good as the other King adaptations.<br />Rated R for language and graphic horror violence/gore.
0393317552|4.0|This is a fascinating and comprehensive attempt to understand the present makeup of the world population. Why do some societies thrive while others die on the vine? His basic arguments are compelling though the scope is a bit overwhelming. If you grew up next to crops that could be domesticated and with large animals to help plow the fields and that you could eat, you have a helluva chance of surviving and growing. If the population grows, more innovations happen. Armies can be supported and expansion can proceed. If you also happen to live on a land mass with an east-west axis, rather than north-south, you have the latitude thing going for you and better diffusion for your crops.<br />In other words, it really isn't a race thing. Fascinating in its' scope, though a bit pedantic and repetitive on the same issues.It's really a question of survival of those born in the hood.<br />Most interesting parts. Pizarro and the Incas, the problem with domesticating zebras, Madagascar being Asian(10,000 years ago, going 4000 miles across the Indian Ocean without a compass or map?!);Bantus not making it to southern Africa and not blocking European expansion in south Africa, thus changing history, the origin of disease-stay away from those pigs, China's walking away from their lead in development, and the overall detective work, tying in biology, archeology and linguistics.<br />Have you eaten your wheaties?
B00002Z88D|1.0|Just when I thought Metallica couldent get any worse....They did. This record is an insult and a slap in theface to true metal fans.They Destroy many Metallica Classics on this CD sacred songs Like Master of Puppets,Battery,and for Whom the Bell Tolls are Butchered on this record.If I could give this CD ZERO stars...I would do so.When it comes to this Live double CD I have three words of advice....DONT BUY IT!!
B000000W5L|5.0|The Stones may have made more focused records, better-sounding, with finer compositions; but they never made a record more, well, Stonesier. Endearing, raunchy, oddly confessional, Exile is one of the most influential records of all time. And the nice guys at Rolling Stones Records have squeezed the entire 2LP set onto one CD! (Are you listening, Decca?) That a bunch of British blokes in a French basement made one of the greatest American records ever is an odd yet great achievement. Crank it up one more time!
B00001QEE6|5.0|WOW!  This is a TIMELESS movie if there ever was one! If you want to see a classic, beautifully animated, charming, entertaining, and HILARIOUS movie, see this one!  One of the few disney movies, next to teh fox and the hound, which integrates the animal and the human worlds together.  You have to love when \\"Darling\\" is pregnant and wants \\"Jim Dear\\" to run out in the rain for some watermelon...and chop suey.  Stuff like that makes this movie timeless.  I found it much funnier now than when i was a small child...i probably didn't even get the jokes back then...so all you people who think you are too old for disney movies, this one will prove that wrong.  A beautiful story, with surprisingly well-developed characters (after all, they are mostly dogs, among other animals in true disney tradition...) and the setting is very true to the Victorian era.  Loveable as all get-out!
0345347951|4.0|In the words of Stan Ridgway, &quot;The overlords got me working overtime.&quot;  This book sets the stage for Mr. Clarke.  It was written in the 1952 or 1953 (sorry I finished it and loaned it out **mistake** I still haven't gotten it back).  I really like the way he weaves mythology and science together in this book.  This is indeed a classic.
B000002H2H|4.0|Ride the Lightning marks the begining of a somewhat Progressive era in Metallica's career that would last for the next two Albumns. Every song Hits you like a ton of Bricks.James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich came into their own as songwriters on this CD,They went in a diffrent direction without selling out. (they waited a few years to do that)The only thing that keeps me from giving this CD 5 stars is the fact that it only has 8 songs.But Thats the only bad point ...If you like heavy Metal you will love this CD......I do.
6302787300|5.0|The key to understanding Ridley Scott is that he is always best when recreating an entire universe, not uncommonly of the historical variety, which the audience can enter into and live within. So it is with 1492- Conquest of Paradise, where the 15th Century Spain of Columbus and Queen Isabella is convincingly depicted to epic dimensions fitting to the subject. Depardieu makes for an appropriately impassioned yet ultimately doomed Columbus - never underestimate the dramatic range of this fine actor. An unrecognised masterpiece in which the unavoidable moral and philosophical issues of exploration and colonisation are treated with measured subtlety and the viewer is for once credited with some intelligence. A fine achievement.
B00003CXE7|5.0|&quot;Gladiator&quot;. Even the name invokes reverence, and the film honors the rich history of Rome and its rulers. The filming is exquisite, beginning with a cryptic, foreshadowing scene that leaves the viewer waiting to unwrap the present that is: &quot;Gladiator&quot;. <br />In my opinion, the mark of a true actor resides in the eyes. Only two places have I scene true, genius acting. One of which was Joaquin Phoenix's Caesar. In most films, there is a typical villain that all love to hate. Usually, the villain has one side to his/her personality, but not so with Caesar. I must admit, Caesar was my favorite character, Joaquin Phoenix made me truly sympathize with Caesar and made me realize that there is more to a person than hate and greed. Caesar was an individual with issues that corrupted his personality. Joaquin Phoenix's Caesar was not your typical &quot;bad guy&quot;.<br />The many fight sequences of &quot;Gladiator&quot; were perfectly done. The sword fighting seemed almost an intricate dance, with the dancers moving to the flow of the music that fills the theater or living room. It makes almost a sickening (but not the less beautiful) parallel: the wonderful music, the intricate dance moves, and the blood.<br />It seems that one of Gladiator's themes was the gradual degration of present day society into the gruesome games of the past. Wrestling disturbingly seems just too similar to the gladiators. It seems that all roads (even the roads of time), really do lead back to Rome. <br />The director of &quot;Gladiator&quot; pulled all the stops out on this one. When the Colosseum comes into view, it is so realistic that I almost feel that I am partaking in the battles and dances of sword fighting.<br />When it comes to &quot;Gladiator&quot;, buy it, rent it, borrow it- just get it! Enter the arena, don't look back, and join the dance.
B000058T5E|5.0|This cd rips!  Not a bad cut on it.  My only complaint is that its only 39 minutes.  But then, I've bought 60 minute cd's that don't have near 40 minutes worth hearing.  The sample in Roy's Toy like none other.  This thing just kicks ass!
B000002HRE|1.0|I posted a review calling &quot;load&quot; the worst Heavy Metal record ever recorded.I have to take that back because this one is worse.Not one song on this record will go down as a Metallica Classic, (but that is to be expected as they have not written any classic songs since And Justice for All)and not unlike the joke of an albumn &quot;Load&quot;... not one good song.I hope one day Metallica will see the error of their ways and Give Metallica back to the People who made them.Dont waste your Money on this or any Metallica CD after ...And Justice for all...not because of the Napster thing...but because they just arent any good.
0684865130|4.0|Catch-22 By Joseph Heller (463 pages)<br />Book Description  History teaches World War II from a bystander's point of view, when in reality the truth comes from the diction of the people that were actually there.  Published first in 1955, Catch-22 is an incredible story of life during World War II and many stories of soldiers during battle.  Although, there are handfuls of characters, the storyline follows the life of a young American bomber by the name of Yossarian, and his struggles to break free of the war.  Life for everyone living near and around Yossarian off of the coast of Italy is tragic and very authentic.  The men experience fear, love and hatred, murder, confusion, and the yearning desire to go home.  <br />Review Catch-22 is an astounding view of war, and its effects on its participants.  Although slow and complicated at first, the conversations and humor make it a favorite read and one that can't be put down until finished.  It shows the realities of World War II and how victory comes with consequences.<br />Through Yossarian's stay in Italy, the reader becomes sympathetic to Yossarian and his comrades.  They struggle through fear of the slightest things and are almost certain they will not arrive home alive.  The men are classified as psychotic, and through their conversations the reader gains a sense of humor of all the many predicaments they get themselves into.  <br />Heller emphasizes the importance of every page through tricky conversations that requires the reader's devout attention.  He doesn't leave one stone unturned.  Catch-22 is very descriptive and not an easy read, but one that will leave the reader with better knowledge of life during World War II.  It is a moving novel for both young and old, and reminds the reader that World War II will not be forgotten.
0783229526|4.0|Hunter S. Thompson's seminal Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was a twisted, paranoid composite of two trips he and his attorney made to Vegas in the early seventies while Thompson was working for Rolling Stone. His vain attempt to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race and a District Attorney's conference on drugs tailspins into a mescaline, speed, and alcohol fueled vision quest in search of the American Dream. The movie glosses over most of the deeper parts of the story, but the first half of the movie creates a good illusion of fidelity to the first half of the book. Unfortunately, the second half glosses over more than just the deeper parts of the book and the viewer gets the impression that Gilliam was just trying to get the movie in the can and be done with it. The second half of Fear and Loathing eerily reminds me of the second half of David Lynch's adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic novel, Dune. <br />Both Depp (Hollywood's most underappreciated actor) and Del Toro (who was all but unrecognizable due to the weight difference) did a superb job with the material they were given. If any filmaker ever has the guts to portray Hunter Thompson again, (e.g. a film version of his semi-fictional &quot;The Rum Diary&quot;) Depp is the man for the job. Its good to see Del Toro out of his stereotyped criminal role; he is a very versatile actor.<br />The final score: If you are already an HST freak AND a Monty Python freak, this movie is worth the viewing, just don't expect anything more than a visually lush journey into drug induced decadence. If you've never read the book, I would advise reading it before watching the movie. Having a familiarity with the novel will clear up some confusion in the movie.
0671024256|5.0|In the spirit of Mr. King's admonition to follow Rule 17 of Strunk &amp; White's Elements Of Style (&quot;Omit needless words&quot;), I'll try to keep this brief.<br />Two main points, then:<br />1) THIS IS NOT A WORK OF FICTION. If you're purchasing this thinking it's Stephen King's new novel or short story collection, you will probably be disappointed. Which brings me to my next point.<br />2) Just because this isn't fiction doesn't mean it's not worth reading. No, sirree. Actually, it's one of only two or three King books that I read more or less in a sitting (the other two, I believe, were Carrie and Cycle Of The Werewolf). That's partly because it's so brief (less than 300 pages), &amp; parly because I found it absolutely fascinating.<br />If you're someone who doesn't want to know how the magician does his tricks, or how the magician became a magician, you'll probably want to steer clear of this one. Me, I'm always intrigued by that stuff. <br />I loved On Writing. If you're like me, &amp; want to know how one of our finest writers does what he does (&amp; how, perhaps, to do it yourself), do yourself a favor &amp; pick this one up.
068483605X|5.0|The book is not about rabbits like you may think.  It is a tale of exile and survival.  It is a novel of adventurous rabbits that have to desert their home and venture forth to find a new home.  One glorious adventure one afeter an other.     Once you start to read it you won't want to put it down.  It is a good book for all ages.
B00005B7CK|5.0|&quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; rates as one of my all-time favorites. It's rare to find a movie that hits a home run visually, musically, with a wonderful story AND superb acting. The movie pulls you into the characters' lives (and what characters they are) and the deeper undertones of life and times in the South add a certain poignancy and depth to a wonderfully unique and engrossing story. And speaking of the acting...I am a fan of George Clooney and thought he was an adequate actor but was blown away by his performance in &quot;O Brother.&quot; The highest praise I can offer is that I forgot it was &quot;George Clooney&quot; in the part -- he took over his role and made it his own, and certainly deserved his Golden Globe. This movie offers qualities often missing in many if not most cinematic offerings today: uniqueness, quality and depth. Bravo to all involved!
B0000584V3|4.0|Fans who have been following Opeth over the last few albums are sure to enjoy this one. It doesn't revolutionize their sound at all. They simply expand on the style they established with \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" (as they did with \\"Still Life\\"). More modern influences are becoming increasingly evident. I hear parts that sound like technical death metal, traditional heavy metal, progressive rock (obviously), etc. I can't say that this album is perfect though. The performance is mixed. There are really excellent parts in all the songs that are balanced by equally cheesy or lacking moments due perhaps to lazy songwriting. Also, Akerfeldt wavers on the clean vocals multiple times. He gave excellent clean vox performances on both \\"Morningrise\\" and \\"MAYH\\", but seems to have faltered this time. I tend to enjoy the death metal vocals on this album quite a bit more than the clean vocals, which is contrary to how I felt on the albums I just mentioned. Nevertheless, this is obviously a good album, and should be purchased by fans of previous albums. Unfortuately, I feel it is increasingly evident that the grandeur of the classic albums is fading away. I guess I kind of saw it coming with \\"Still Life\\". This is the first Opeth album I have given less than 5 stars.
B00003CXSO|4.0|Ok... for all you people out there. This movie was to be based on the book alone. Not &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot; This may have the same characters, but this movie was to be taken as any other NEW movie out in Hollywood. The movie, in my opinion, was wonderful. The background that I did have from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; helped by knowing the characters. The movie stayed true to the book except for the over-testosteroned woman that was Verger's sister.( I didn't wan't to see that anyway.) Plus, all you people out there who didn't understand the part in the book about the pigs, SEE THE MOVIE!! It explains it. Watch the movie with a clear head. Don't go expecting the same performance as SOTL. It's just not the same. Also, read the book afterwards. It will help explain some of the things that you don't understand in the movie. My hat goes off to the cast and crew who made this movie. It was an excellent horror film of all times. I practically took my friend's arm off. Thanks for the spooks!! Oh, and Harris, Write another good one...
B00004RFCM|5.0|For all you modern women out there, this collection is a must!  It is something you will enjoy watching over and over again.

031286504X|5.0|This book is wonderful! Matheson has inspired me to write my own novel. I absolutely loved this book. It was by far the creepiest story I have ever read. The beginning of the book just screams to be made into a movie (there have already been 2 made: The Last Man On Earth starring Vincent Price, and The Omega Man starring Charlton Heston). I heard that there would be another movie made starring Arnold Schwarzenegger but I hope to God that the film never comes out.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Why can't we just get a true &quot;Soundtrack&quot; for this film?   Movie soundtracks that showcase contemporary artists performing songs that may or may not appear in the film in place of the theatrical score are a sore point for me and this CD is a bit irritating in that vein as well.   I am disinclined to believe that Fat Boy Slim's and Christina's fans are not going to be rushing out to see this film or fond of it if they do, just as I am inclined to believe that, like myself, fans of this film will not necessarily be fans of the aforementioned artists.   Moulin Rouge-ers will be going to the music store to buy a CD that will allow them to relive the film through its music - unfortunately, they will only be permitted to relive some of those moments, as this CD is 1/2 film music and 1/2 mindless crossmarketing effort.  While many of the great musical moments from the film are indeed on this CD and I certainly have no regrets on the purchase, the music of the film's emotional climax is conspicuously and disappointingly absent - the result is that the CD only tells about half of the story and then ends rather abruptly and omits the show's most gripping and enthralling musical moment. <br />Moulin Rouge's music is exciting, frenetic and innovative - its just too bad more of it isn't on this disc.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|From &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Lurhmann now brings you &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; There are too many words to describe this movie. However, there is one that just about sums it up, and that is... magical! Kidman and McGregor are a great team that have brought Baz Luhrmann's dream to life. Sure it's a little over the top, but that's how it's supposed to be, larger than life! Baz Lurhmann is definitely onto something here!
B000000IRB|5.0|This is the great album from Pink Floyd not remastered.  In my opinion and that of many others that is the best way to listen to it.  Plus the gold case is very nice, a very nice collectors album.  Bottom line, get this to avoid the remastering on the other cd version.
B00004THAY|1.0|I didn't think I could go wrong with two of my favorite artists on one album, but the songs are so overlly commercialized that they have a very little trace left of the stuff that made the King the King and Clapton Clapton. The title track is the worst offender of all of the songs. I was truly disappointed.
B00000ILDF|3.0|Nope.  Alien: Resurrection holds the title as thje worst Alien movie.  This film simply should have been the END of the Alien series, or at least for Ripley.  As far as I am concerned, this IS the last movie, because Resurrection is not a part of the Alien series, it is more of a 'wacky spin-off adventure'.<br />In this violent, but sometimes poignant film, we see the survivors of the Sulaco, Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop peacefully in hypersleep, drifting home.  Unfortunately, they had failed to realize something very important.  When the Queen managed to get on the dropship, she had also laid an egg where she hid on the ship.  While drifting back to earth, the egg hatched.  The facehugger tried to get into Newt's capsule, and the shattering glass pierced the creatures, its acidic blood eating through the floor causing a fire.  Then the terror begins yet again...<br />The Sulaco's emergency prep drops the cryo tubes into an EEV(Emergency Escape Vehicle) and ejects it out into space, with the facehugger still on board.  IT plummeted into the gravitational pull of Fiorina 'Fury' 161, a double-Y chromo prison facility.  The EEV plummets into the ocean with disastrous results.<br />Be prepared to break any emotional attachments you made to the surviving characters.  The landing was quite grisly.  The inmates lift the tattered EEV out of the ocean and into the junk pile, bringing RIpley, the only survivor, to the medical facility.  However, as the EEV is placed in the garbage heap, one of the in-mate's Rottweiler is aroused by movement in the EEV...it is the facehugger.<br />Shortly thereafter, we see a brand new breed of alien.  With the replicated genes of a dog, this alien runs on all fours, is incredibly fast, and is by far the meanest Alien we have ever seen in this movie series yet!  When the Warden does not beleive Ripley's story, even after some of the inmates are turning up murdered, it is up to her and her new found friend, Dr. Clemens, to try and convince them all what they are dealing with, but it may already be too late, as Ripley herself is carrying with her a horrible secret, that not even she knows about yet...<br />Although this movie got bad reviews, and is my least favorite among the trilogy(I do not consider Resurrection a part of the series), I definitely think that the Runner, or Dog Alien, is probably the best alien in all the movies.  Unbeleivably vicious and just, to quote Superintendant Andrews, 'Generally Unpleasant', the beast has a mean streak and often toys with the prisoners, making this the darkest and most violent of the trilogy.  <br />The bad parts about the movie are obvious.  After seeing the Colonial marines in action, it is tough to see the events of this movie.  You will miss the marines.  Another very troubling aspect is the deahts of Hicks and Newt, whom Ripley had strived so very hard to rescue in the last movie, only to have their lives sorrowfully taken from them.  Seeing Hicks die, as my favorite character from Aliens, was upsetting.  The acting isn't exactly top notch, but you will grow to like a few of the prisoners, namely Morse and Dillon.  Not the best in the trilogy, but it definitely brings a good closure to the series.  Unfortunately, Alien: Resurrection ruined this closure by bringing us a rather poor plot and extremely poor acting, not to mention a whole new take on the Aliens, which i felt was stupid and unnecessary.  Keep Alien 3 as the final movie.  Watch Alien: Resurrection if you are in the mood for a 'wacky spin-off', because that is all it is.
0060392886|4.0|This book is not a great literary work, but it is an amazing documentation of the career of Motley Crue. I've been a fan of these guys since the mid-80s when I was 16, and have always been fascinated by them. The fact that these four guys somehow found each other, and were lucky enough to become the biggest metal band in the world despite all their self-destructive behavior is truly amazing. I've always viewed Vince, Nikki, Tommy and Mick as four cartoon characters who somehow survive their misadventures with no consequences. However, the book reveals the human side of their decadance....drug addiction, lost fortunes, divorces, death. It's an interesting study of how four men from broken homes who have no education, no self-control and tons of money decide to live their lives. My only minor criticism of the book is that it could have focused just a little more on the Crue's music and videos. They actually have turned out to be an influential band for their music, look and videos, and that fact seems to always be overshadowed by their rock star lifestyle.
0618135871|5.0|It's useful to think of &quot;The Dying Animal&quot; as a coda to Roth's magnificent trilogy of books on post-war America--&quot;American Pastoral&quot;, &quot;I Married a Communist&quot;, and &quot;The Human Stain.&quot;  It functions much the same way as &quot;The Prague Orgy&quot; did as that novella summed up his earlier &quot;Zuckerman Bound&quot; trilogy.  The themes of the earlier books are cast in unexpected new ways that show even more light.  The protagonist of this new book is Kepesh, not Zuckerman, but the preoccupations of this book are the same as the American trilogy--how do you reinvent yourself like a good American who can supposedly just shuck off the past; what is the price you pay for that spiritual reformation (or deformation.)  This David Kepesh's history is somewhat altered from the Kepesh of &quot;The Breast&quot; and &quot;The Professor of Desire&quot;; he now has a middle-aged son who hates him and one somewhat shadowy ex-wife who he abandoned during the sexual upheaval of the 60's.  Otherwise he remains the same; a hedonistic moralist intoxicated by female beauty (especially breasts:  he loves a voluptuary Modigliani painting of a female nude that appears on the jacket of this novel.)  In his sixties he begins an affair with Consuela, a decorous young Cuban-American woman who presses all the right buttons for the aging professor.  Intertwined with the story is a marvelous debate on the meaning of the cultural revolution of the '60's and '70's.  Kepesh is predictably king-hell for freedom, but his son is a constant unwelcome reminder of the damage done.  One again as in &quot;Operation Shylock&quot; and the American trilogy Roth brilliantly shows a man tearing himself in two trying to &quot;break on through to the other side&quot;, to a life without history and consequences.  Once again Roth shows us that he can write an English sentence better than anyone else.  Again we get his excruciating, tragic, comic self-indictment.  For at the end it turns out that Consuela needs Kepesh in a most desparate, life-or-death sense and Kepesh is forced to confront the fact of her not as just a breast, not as his somewhat dim little girlfriend (as he thoughtlessly sees her) but as a human being in terrible trouble.  The final pages as as harrowing as anything Roth has written.  This book, by the greatest living American writer, is required reading for lovers of American fiction.it turns out that Consuela needs Kepesh in a most desparate, life-or-death sense and Kepesh is forced to confront the fact of her not as just a breast, not as his somewhat dim little girlfriend (as he thoughtlessly sees her) but as a human being in terrible trouble.

B00004VVN9|2.0|This is a truly great film, and like Bladerunner, was years ahead of its time. Unfortunately this DVD has is possibly one of the worst transfers I've seen. If your thinking of buying, don't.  Wait until the studio releases gets it together and gives this film the attention it deserves with a restored anamorphic release.
B00005B6C9|1.0|I've been a BeeGees fan for 20 years now.  I reviewed their &quot;Living Eyes&quot; album and said it stunk.  That it was the worst they'd ever done.<br />I take it all back.  THIS album is the worst they have ever done.  One word to sum it up....YUCK!  I hear songs that are goofy, ridiculous and nonsensical.<br />I don't hear the &quot;back to basics&quot; sound that Barry Gibb has described.  In comparison to their work from the 60's and 70's, this album doesn't do it for me.<br />I played the album all the way through, one time, to give it a chance.<br />The only song that I can tolerate is the title track.  The rest is garbage.<br />I never thought that I would say this, but, guys, it's time to retire.  I think you've used up all of your ideas.  It's time to spend more time at home with the wife and kids.
6300163423|4.0|No other film will ever give you the sensation felt at the end of this one!  Mickey Rourke stars in this scary as hell film of lost souls and dirty deals.  Rourke is a gritty private investigator that is hired by De Niro (The Devil) to go and track down a man named John Favorite.  Mickey follows the clues left behind by Favorite, and becomes more and more drawn into the man's past.  Every witness that Mickey interviews suddenly ends up horribly mutilated and without a trace of why!  I will noy give away the ending on this one! But I can say that it is plainly one of the scariest movies ever made, not with gore or anything stupid like &quot;monsters&quot;, but phycologically, it contains an incredibly frightening premice.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I won't give away the movie.. but give it a chance.. It's not just about fighting. Steller performances and a great job filming make this movie one of my best..<br />I have the 2 disc DVD and they went all out making this set! BUY IT!
0385474547|5.0|This book was truly a delight to read, however the first time I read, I will agree with some, it was a bit tedious.  Yet as one grows older and reads this book again, it is amazing how much one can learn from it.  This book is beutifully written by Achebe, giving us great and an objective insight into Ibo culture.  Okonkwo, the main character, has a tragic flaw, and contrary to common belief, is a hero.  The end of the book proves to the reader this point.  If you read this book only once, you will miss all the great nuances of this book, such as the hypocracy of the 'white men' who come and take of the 'savage' Ibo people.  The father-son conflict, is also very intriging, between Okonkwo and his father, and Okonkwo and Nwoye, his son.  <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone, it allows you the chance to learn about a different culture and your own.  It also shows you how people's minds work. Sharing knowledge and living peacefully with one another is another theme in this great yet short book.  Hopefully leaders of the world will read this book and take lessons from it, &quot;what works for one people is an abomantaion on another&quot; Thank you Achebe for writing such a wonderful book.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Ok, I haven't written a review in a while, but this deserves as much praise as anything. It is a must-see movie, even if you are rovinato(a rather interesting italian term meaning&quot;Psychologically abused to the point of being broken&quot;,use it on your friends) and somehow do not enjoy this masterpiece, you must see it for its sheer originality. Is it like nothing you've ever seen before, or quite possibly will again. U know the story, all I'll say is &quot;Old Setting, New Music&quot;, including the cancan remixed by Fatboy Slim. I thought Fight Club was the most original film I'd experienced, but this may top it. So go and see it, 5/5. 10/10. 100%. Perfect sixes, whatever you want to call it, its da bomb. U R THE WEAKEST LINK. GOODBYE (But Moulin Rouge is very strong ;).
B00003CXE7|5.0|This a great movie, but it lacks the power of Braveheart.  It is one of my 20 favorites though
6305127646|4.0|Having never seen the original Saint series with Roger Moore or other depictions of the character, I cannot comment on how closely Val Kilmer's portrayal of the Saint is to the original.  But as a stand-alone spy movie, the Saint is excellent.  Kilmer has a very different look as a spy and Simon Templar's character throughout the movie is very interesting.  He is cold at times and yet unbelievably warm.  Throw the very attractive and sensitive Elizabeth Shue into the mix and you have a great romance brewing.  But actors interact wonderfully together as the story moves along.<br />The plot's focus on scandal involving corrupt Russian tycoons is a great look at a possibly near-future situation and the current instability that already affects Eastern Europe.  With some comidy, action, and suspense thrown in, the viewers are left with a very satisfying and enjoyable movie.  <br />This movie is one of my personal favorites, a lot due to Kilmer and Shue's characters, and also due to the plot twists and turns.  The Saint has the right amounts of every ingredient to make it a winner.
B00003CX95|5.0|How the heck did Mel Gibson not win best actor for this.  He gives one of the greatest acting and directing performances ever. The dialogue was great, it is fairly historically accurate (although William Wallace was actually like 6 feet 8 inches.  It has the war scenes to rival Saving Private Ryan, testosterone to match Fight Club and great characters.  It is one of the most powerful movies ever in the last scenes and during William Wallaces speeches.  They fought like warrior poets, they fought like Scotsmen
B000050XXO|5.0|Casablanca is a classic for the ages.  It has great character development which will draw you into the story and help you experience the desperation of escaping the Nazi occupied Europe in 1942.  Bogart gives a excellent performance as an American bar owner in Casablanca who's past comes back to haunt him as he unwillingly becomes involved in a freedom fighter's escape from the Nazi's.   Bergman also gives a strong performance as Bogart's former flame.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone.  It has the drama, suspense, and plot twists to keep you on your toes.
B00003CXN4|2.0|A story of drug trafficking told in a refreshing format.  In this film, the director sets the stage for brightly portraying a fast-moving convoluted tale of &quot;good guys&quot; (FBI, ATF, DEA et al) v. the &quot;bad guys,&quot; a competing pair of drug cartels in Mexico.  The director should get five stars, but the film gets two stars because the plot is stale and the story seems to focus on image building of our Federal Agencies.<br />        This strikes me as a modern day knock-off of the TV series about the FBI, which ran in the 1950's, starring Ephram Zimbalist Jr.  It was extremely popular back then, assuring the public they should fear no evil just so long as the FBI was in charge.  It stayed that way until one day (long into the series) the public learned that each and every episode was personally approved by the Director of the FBI --- the man himself --- J. Edgar Hoover.  If I recall correctly, it was said that Hoover actually hand picked Zimbalist Jr., as the starring lead.  Hello......  since when do the feds control content?<br />   The cast is great, but I felt throughout that I was watching an infomercial that says kids do drugs because parents don't care enough, but there is still hope thanks to our Federal Agencies.  Give me a break....  Please?
B000002J09|5.0|Well, yes, it is one crazy trip through the world of Led Zeppelin that I have been on.   Much like my other favourite bands, Pink Floyd and The Jimi Hendrix Experience (or Band Of Gypsies, or Gypsy, Sun and Rainbows) Led Zeppelin has long been regarded as a quintessential sixties and seventies icon.<br />IV, Zoso, or Runes, as the album has been called at different times, is often cited by fans and critics alike as Zep's strongest work: a melding of psychodelic blues rock and beatiful and melodic acoustic tracks.  Though IV is only my third album, I'd have to agree with the belief that it is the bands best work (or maybe Houses Of The Holy, depends often on the mood I'm in).<br />From the first chord, IV pulls you in and lets you experience rather than listen.  You feel, you hear, and you see the album as a whole, and it fails to let go until the disc is done, releasing you back into the cold, harsh reality of the real world.<br />Black Dog and Rock And Roll are a formidable pairing of tracks, 8 minutes of unabrashed pure hard rock.  And that's what they were best at.  With the possible exceptions of Black Sabbath and a few others, no one could ever match Led Zeppelin when it came to all-out rock assualts.  The tracks meld so well together in fact, that if you aren't paying attention, you almost don't even relaize the shift in songs. Following that is the other great duo of the disc-the undefeatable duo of Battle Of Evermore and Stairway To Heaven.  Almost fourteen minutes of some of the most awe-inspiring acoustic work are laid down here, and honestly, it is some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.  Jimmy Page is fantastic on the acoustic, and Robert Plant's voice soar over the well thought out arrangements.  Sure, Stairway is an overplayed song, but there's a reason for that: it is simply one of the greatest songs ever written.  Definetely not the greatest, but it still shines to this day as a testament to what four men can do with drums, bass, vocals and a simple acoustic guitar.<br />Tracks 5 and 6, \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" and \\"Four Sticks\\" are probably the weakest entries on the album, but still fantastic on any level.  Especially on \\"Hop\\" does more of that hard-rock beauty shine through.  Though definetely not unbearable, and still great songs in their own right, I can understand why some may not like them.<br />However, if you don't, the nest two tracks will probably make the experience worthwhile anyways.  Going To California is probably LZ's most beautiful acoustic song (with the possible exception of Evermore) and the fact that it doesn't recieve too much airplay helps to maintain the longevity of just how cool it is.<br />Of course, the apocolyptic finale of the record is the band's unforgettable reading of Memphis Minnie's \\"When The Levee Breaks.\\"  While being the heaviest album on the record, so much emotion is still able to come through, making this a definite great choice for an album closer.  Even if your interest begins to waver for a second, that incredible double bass and rocking riff will drag you back in for one hell of a song.  Though often overlooked, I think \\"Levee\\" is honestly one of the band's top ten songs, and it easily outdoes anything released in the last year (maybe except Tool, the only bearable current band in my mind).<br />If I could have one complaint, it would be Robert Plant's vocals.  Depending on who you ask, some see them as heavenly, some see them as broken, disconnected and just downright difficult to listen to.  I use to be of the opinion in the latter category until I just gave myself more time and allowed myself to soak in just what his lyrics were saying.  Now, although I still find them somewhat difficult, they've become beatiful, like an ugly dog that you just think is adorable (bad analogy, but my noggin' is starting to ache).  Now, I can appreciate the harshness of his voice, because I understand the point trying to be given.  And that sounds beautiful indeed.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Remember the last time when the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo &amp; Juliet was such a big hit. This time is no exception. The soundtrack is filled with glam rock, hip trip and stunning musical tracks.<br /> The Missy Eillott produced #1 hit Lady Marmalade starts the soundtrack off but this is not the highlight. The tracks by actors Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kidman are the real treat. With little prior singing experiences, the duo thrills and dazzles with an array of songs. Nicole shines in the fusion of Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend and Material Girl. She gives her best in the relational One Day I'll Fly Away, Elephant Love Medley &amp; Come What May. Similarly for Ewan on Elton John's Your Song&amp; El Tango De Roxanne plus his collaborations with Nicole.<br /> Oter standout tracks include the Timaland-produced, Beck-performed remake of David Bowie's Diamond Dogs. Even Miss Daine Warren and David Forster sound so much more incredible here. Can't believe Rhythm of The Night was a Diane Warren composition.<br /> Don't hesistate, Moulin Rogue is one of those movies u gotta watch and its soundtrack u gotta buy. Relish!
0780626494|5.0|Brenden Fraser and the others did a great job captureing the life of the early 60s.  Every stereotype was in the movie.  Many scenes were both scary and funny.  In a warped sense, the innocence of that age has been captured and we have lost something in our culture today.
B00005AUBA|5.0|Mogwai's latest offering has received many indifferent reviews, but to these ears it sounds even more adventurous and inventive than any of their previous releases.  What has changed is that their compositions sound a lot less monolithic, themes are stated with less regularity and tones and textures are explored with far greater subtlety.  &quot;Rock Action&quot; also bears a newfound aura of inner calm, remniscent of the more mellow rock music from the late '60s and early '70s.  This doesn't make the album the least bit retro, instead it softens the &quot;math rock&quot; element and bodes very well for Mogwai's future appeal.
014028009X|3.0|I really enjoyed this book, because it showed how an average single woman goes through struggles with empowering herself.  For Bridget, she felt that dieting and sleeping with a man at her work would empower her, when in the end she found empowerment in a man she shut off from the first glance.  For me, I thought that the ending, when her dieting stops, her lovelife is complete, and all family life is calm, was the best part of the novel.  On the flipside, when Bridget had dieted herself into a tired looking older woman, I felt really sorry for her, and didn't find that part as enjoying as I did the others.  Although this book didn't have a theme, the interesting plot and unique way the book was written;in someone's personal diary, made up for it.  The book focuses on Bridget's obsession with dieting, cigarette and alcohol intake, along with her fetish with self-poise.  She tries every idea thrown her way, but it isn't until a sweet man walks into her life, that all the superficial elements walk out.  Throughout the book Bridget struggles with keeping her family life from interferring with her social and work lives.
0060392886|5.0|What a yummy book! I couldn't put it down until I had read every last word. Drugs, sex, partying, and music...even if someone didn't care for Motley Crue much, everyone likes one of the aforementioned, right? Buy it and eat it up!

0553571338|5.0|Lois Lowry puts such great detail in this book, it makes you feel like you are with Jona. It is weird to read about a different world, especially Jona's. The &quot;sameness&quot; in their world just makes the book more interenting. Jona goes through many changes and has lots of emotions throughout the book. I reccomend this book to any grade above 5th. This is a GREAT reader!      Jona has the most mportant job in the whole community because &quot;The Giver&quot; is the only one who sees the world as it really is. The Giver gets to see everything in a different way, which makes the person change entirely now that they know the truth.      I could not put this book down! The plot just makes you want to keep reading and reading it!
0140067477|5.0|This has to be the most insightful book on the Tao that I have ever read! I struggled for a long time to understand what Lao Tzu was talking about, and couldn't help but feel that there were alot of untranslatable phrases. This book brought the idea of Tao home for me, in a way that I hadn't believed could be so clear! The lucid, vivid writing style of the author adds to the readability of the book. Highly recommended
B00003OSU4|5.0|I live in Gloucestershire, England and could not find this DVD in UK. Thanks to Amazon and the Web, my copy arrived in (...)days! I first saw this wonderful film many years ago and I remember how it affected me. A passion for jazz AND photography makes this film the perfect vehicle to soak up the atmosphere of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. I would have been 8 years old when it was filmed and even at that early age, I was into Monk, Mulligan and Shearing. George lives just up the road from me and I know him quite well. He would have been 39 in 1958.<br />The film is beautifully shot, focusing on the performances, the music and atmosphere, but without a documentary. It doesn't need one! The way Bert Stern moves from artiste to audience is superb. Cool performers and guys in the audience, young and old all on the \\"afterbeat\\". Wonderful to see Monk playing \\"Blue Monk\\", Anita O'Day singing \\"Georgia Brown\\". Dig that hat!! And Mr Shearing with quintet, performing a late slot - fantastic!<br />The icing on the cake is an interactive journey, narrated by Mr Stern, behind the scenes of the film. He tells you his thinking, his emerging appreciation of jazz and his roots in photography. This is interlinked with specific sequences from his unique film. As the liner notes say \\"I was just . . . basically a photographer who wanted to make a movie before I was 30 . . . it was a form of a documentary and had a lot to do with photograhy . . . it wasn't something that I had ever seen before and it just intrigued me . . . it's more of of a happening. . . interpretive,  happening . . .\\"<br />The quality of the video and audio is brilliant. If you appreciate photography or jazz, or like me . . . both, this film is a real must. Highly recommended! Regards to all,  JON' B.
B00003CXDZ|2.0|What started out as a fun, rocking, visually stunning beginning which made me think I had wandered into the next &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; slowly put me to sleep and left me wondering how much time was left before it would finally end and I could go home to bed.  The ongoing &quot;theme&quot; of using several different popular songs throughout the movie quickly became tiring and then irritating.  I felt like I was watching a musical medly from some badly performed Academy Awards number.  The tragic love story was poorly scripted and the fact that Saline (Kidman) was dying was so overdone that by the time it reached its inevitable conclusion, I had lost interest and felt no emotional involvement (such as I did in Titanic, for example).  The pacing of the movie was plodding.   There was no real action, nothing to keep the story moving along and me interested in it.  There were some good points though.  Besides the amazing sets (which I also eventually grew tired of, sorry) Ewan McGregor sings really well (I can't really say the same for Kidman), John Leguizamo as Toulouse-Lautrec was hilarious and entertaining throughout, and the fat guy (who looked like the Wizard of Oz) playing Zidler was great.  Also, the only original song in the production, &quot;Come what May&quot;, was easily my favorite song of the movie and I think that it will go on to become a big hit this summer.  Summing up, I think this movie had almost all the right stuff to be a really great and memorable movie, except that the director, who obviously put a lot of effort and care into creating this dense musical montage, forgot to start with the most basic ingredient - a script that didn't suck.
B000001IPL|5.0|This cd is one of the cds responsible for punk's revivl and let me tell you, it hits hard. The Cd opens up with some &quot;nitro&quot; and &quot;finishes with a &quot;smashing&quot; ending. This cd had 3 big singles (gotta get away, self estem, and come out and play) which are some of the best songs on the album. My favroite song on the cd is &quot;Bad Habit&quot; which is fast, heavy, and funny at the same time. My second favroite is come out and play (I love the egypt part). Noodles, while not playing the most complicated guitar, gets the job done and seems to blend in well, but punk isnt known for hard guitar, is it? Dexter's squeeky, high pitched vocals somehow seem good and likeable. This album was the highest selling indipendent album (six million, I think) for a reason, It revived punk and Its the offsprings' best effort to date. Get it and you wont be dissipointed.
B00004RD54|5.0|On December 21, 1973, Lou Reed performed at the Academy of Music, NYC, in one of the greatest rock n roll concerts ever.  &quot;Rock N Roll Animal&quot; is an awesome album, the bulk of it being material from &quot;Berlin&quot; as well as a few VU classics (Sweet Jane, Rock N Roll).  Reed goes all out, attacking the audience with the short cropped hair, the face makeup, and a badass attitude.  Reed introduces the audience to what real rock n roll is with the new, metalized Sweet Jane.  The best part about this version of Sweet Jane, and the rest of the album, is the dueling electric guitars of Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner.  The intro prior to Sweet Jane is great; a slow pace that gradually increases into an electric frenzy.  On the next track, Heroin is outstanding.  This may be the best cut of Heroin all time.  If you have the new, reissued CD, you also get Caroline Says and How Do You Think it Feels.  Both are strong, made better because of hard core electric.  White Light/White Heat is very good, especially with Reed screaming in a frenzy, describing this particular hit of Heroin while being backed by all-star guitarists Wagner and Hunter.  To end the album with a bang, Reed unleashes a new cut of an old VU classic, Rock N Roll.  As with all the other songs, it is made better by going electric.  While this album is a Lou Reed album, Reed is overshadowed by his band, specifically Wagner and Hunter.  But the material is classic Lou from the Underground Days and his strong, explicit vocal performance can't be beat.  This man is truly a Rock N Roll Animal.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Moulin Rogue is an eclectic mix of originals, cover songs and medleys many sung by the film's stars Nicole Kidman &amp; Ewan MacGregor.  While neither Ms. Kidman or Mr. MacGregor will make you forget the other artists on the album like Beck or Bono, they do a more than credible job on their songs.  Ms. Kidman's vocals are a little slight, but she has a breathy and airy voice that perfectly captures her sex kitten role from the film.  Mr. MacGregor has a sturdy voice and is better on the only original song that he and Ms. Kidman duet on, &quot;Come What May&quot;, than on his version of Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot;.  He doesn't have the subtlety in his voice required to make the song really work.  &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; is a fun song with its combination of great songs.  Beck &amp; Timbaland do an amazing version of David Bowie's &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;.  Beck shares Mr. Bowie's chameleon like ability to change his image, so it is appropriate that he cover one of his songs.  Mr. Bowie himself appears with help from Massive Attack on the solid &quot;Nature Boy&quot;.  &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; is a sexy and sassy cover of the Labelle hit by Christina Aguliera, Lil' Kim, Mya and Pink and just like the original is a number one hit.  Moulin Rogue is an interesting and enjoyable listen and seems to capture the essence of the film quite well.
0553260111|4.0|This is not one of those &quot;take-over-the-world&quot; type of conspiracy which many thrillers seemed to thrive on, it is simply a tale of an amnesiac man who was struggling to survive against all odds.  The man, with unremarkable appearances, found himself marked for death by unseen enemies.  Using skills he never realized he had, he raced across Europe, leaving a bloody trail of deaths.  Millions of dollars are somehow involved, with different people pursuing him for different reasons.  Along the way, he found assistance from the least expected source ...<br />The author did well in several things about this book:<br />The phasings - The book consisted of several phases, with the first phase being the unidentitied person fished out of waters and taken to a small port in southern France. There, he was nursed physically and mentally back to health by an English doctor.  The doctor played the part of the readers, acting out their more common suggestions on how to regain the identity of the amnesiac man without going to the authorities.  Readers who wondered about why the authorities were kept out received a plausible explanation.  However, it is a pity that no more is heard from the doctor for the rest of the book.  He was the more interesting character in this part of the book.<br />Next, having regained his strength and some measure of confidence, plus a bit of control over his emotions, the mysterious man set off to Zurich.  There, he found a city which had known him, or known of him.  He also found himself recognised and targetted to be killed.  It was in this part of the book more of his skills surfacing, not only in self-defence in physical contact, but also self-preservation.<br />The pace of the book picked up from Zurich as more names from the man's past emerged : Jason Bourne, Carlos, Treadstone, New York, and Cain ...  Also, somewhere in his memories are remembrance of assassinations.  Bourne, as the man realised he was known as, had to find out what role he had in the killings and the money, before he was killed.  More and more parties emerged who wanted to neutralise him.<br />As the story travels across Europe, the book entered different phases, each distinct, with the mysterious man changing, evolving or rather, the man who was his past emerging.  Though the book is long, there is no repetition of plots as the man desperate sought for and followed clues after clues to his past. The irony which would have struck the readers was that the action of the man so thoroughly confounded his opponents, though it was the action of a man who couldn't remember, the very actions saved him several times from their traps.<br />Finally, it was only in the last phase that the identity of the man was revealed to readers, who could not have guessed the twist.  Unfortunately for him, his main opposition had also been busy severing his past so that he had nothing to return to.<br />Readers were left wondering how the tale would turn out.  It was rather disappointing as readers would feel that loose ends were left unattended, unaccounted.  At least, within this book.<br />The man created by Ludlum was an excellent piece of work, who would win the readers' sympathies.  Action thrilling paragraphs were also interspersed with contemplations without pointless ramblings, a failing of many thrillers which tried to take themselves too seriously.<br />Definitely a worthwhile read.
B000059HGY|5.0|tora tora tora was a movie made in the era of vietnam, and subsequently the movie has a tinge of social critique, but the social issues are kept tasteful and tactful in a way that does not obscure the movie. (for example, no usn officer is seen with the summer whites at pearl, but rather in dress whites, connotating a certain aura of ceremony in a combat situation)  the movie is also made in part from a japanese perspective with directors and actors, and thus the japanese scenes are (combined with cross reference by the us counterparts) kept as authentic to history as possible.  roles played by actors in Pearl Harbor are seen here, albeit in shorter context, while background characters in Pearl Harbor take the forefront. this movie is a beautiful historical counterpart to the dramitized Pearl Harbor.
6304578458|5.0|No, I'm not kidding. A true sleeper and gains genius with repeat viewings. So original in concept (Sopranos; Analyze this came later!) and just achingly brilliant dialog. Do yourself a favor and turn on the subtitles to this gem. The sequence that resonates every time for me is when Cusack stares at that baby to the strains of Under Pressure. Cult Classic!
0743216458|5.0|This is the book that hooked me on military history.   History comes alive! I still think about the men in this book, the sacrifices that they made.  Every freezing day in December, I remember the men who fought the battle of the Bulge.  Every D-Day, I wonder if i would have had enough strength or just plain guts to jump out of the plane.<br />I don't usually review books because anyone can be a critic, few can write.  Ambrose can write.  Because of this book, I talk to every Vet I meet and ask them about their experiences.  You'd be suprized at what the tell me.<br />So go ahead, read this book.  It just might make you stop and think...and be grateful.  And if Dick Winters reads this review, I just want him to know that he is one of my personal heros.

The dark complexion and light hair and eyes of the Clayr make Lirael an outsider, along with her lack of the &quot;Sight&quot;. Her adventures inside the Clayr's Glacier is many and dangerous, including the battle against the Stilken, a creature resembling a human female with silver eyes and hooks on forearms as long as it's legs.

0812550706|5.0|I'm a Marine, this is on the Marine Corps Reading List. So I read it and fell in love with the story of coming together as a team to overcome an enemy that is overwhelming and unbeatable. It will keep you up at night as you follow a child through an adventure that would make most kids turn and run away. A definite buy for the SCI-FI lover as well as the yound adventurer in all of us.
0385486804|4.0|Chris McCandless wanted an adventure.  He walked into the Alaskan wilderness ill-prepared and did not come out alive. From my vantage point in northern Mn, my initial reaction to this trek was that Chris was insane, suicidal, or just plain dumb!<br />Author Jon Krakauer, himself an adventurer, does a good job of recreating Chris' life and motivation. Krakauer's introspection and comparison of other ill-fated adventurers helps explain Chris while neither canonizing  nor demonizing this young man and his wanderings.  The writing does not get in the way of the story (contra another book about Alaska - The Woman Who Married a Bear - which I am also reviewing today.)

1878424319|5.0|This is an excellent sampler of Toltec wisdom that also happens to condense into one book what Carlos Castaneda did in all of his books taken together (all that's missing are the use of energy passes). In fact, Ruiz captures the most important concepts toward the end: the ego as parasite. Castaneda called it the &quot;foreign installation&quot;, but it's a crucial concept because the Four Agreements wears away at the parasite. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it if you don't want to explore Castaneda. (If you do, I recommend Journey to Ixtlan and Tales of Power. All of Ruiz is in these two books.)
B00005AQGH|4.0|The often repeated sentiment that Tupac was taken from us too soon takes on a new significance after one listens to \\"Makaveli.\\" Starting with \\"Me Against the World\\" and continuing through \\"All Eyez on Me\\" to \\"Makaveli,\\" Tupac's CDs showed an evolution. While it's hard to say which CD was Pac's best, each one of them saw Tupac adding a new element to his mic skills. In \\"Me Against the World\\" Tupac was talking from his heart, in \\"All Eyes on Me\\" he made thugged-out rider songs, and in Makaveli he began to earnestly talk about social issues. One can only wonder what his next full length release would have been like.<br />\\"Makaveli\\" begins with \\"Bomb First\\" a song which displays the one major fault of this CD: anger. By the time \\"Makaveli\\" was made, of course, Tupac was deeply embroiled in the East-West feud which some say took his life; the feud is clearly present on this CD. One wonders what tracks might have been produced had Tupac put his considerable talent toward writing interesting conceptional songs instead of expressing blind rage at Bad Boy and other East Coast MCs.<br />\\"Bomb First\\" also reveals the minor flaw of \\"Makaveli\\": Tupac's posse, known as the Outlawz. Although I must admit that they were less annoying than on other Tupac CDs, Pac is clearly better off without them. For example, on \\"Bomb First\\" E.D.I. Amin raps:<br />Got a little question  for that [...] that made \\"Paparazzi\\" / If you ain't in this rap game, for the [...] cash mayne / then what is your [...] purpose?  None can serve us /<br />First, there's the absurdity of calling out a West Coast MC on an East Coast dis song. Then there is the fact that Xzibit is far more resepcted than E.D.I. Amin will ever be precisely because he is not in the rap game for the money. Unfortunately the Outlawz contribution to \\"Makaveli\\" does not improve from here on.<br />Tupac's lyrics (which apparently took time off when he wrote most of \\"All Eyes on Me\\") are back strong. The man who delivered such lyrical gemsas \\"Me Against the World\\" and \\"If I Die Tonight\\" brings verses like this (From \\"Hail Mary\\"):<br />I'm a ghost in these killin fields / Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go deep inside / the solitary mind of a madman who screams in the dark / Evil lurks, enemies, see me flee / Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame / Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim<br />On more heartfelt songs such as \\"Krazy\\" Tupac shows a maturity not seen in his previous CDs:<br />Hopin God hear me, I entered the game; look how much I changed / I'm no longer innocent - casualties of fame / Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places / And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face / when I gave her the keys to her own house, this your land / Your only son done became a man<br />In addition to Pac's lyrics, another excellent part of this CD are the beats. These 12 tracks are quite simply some of the best beats that Tupac ever worked with.<br />Overall, there is not a single bad song on \\"Makaveli.\\" The negatives from this CD, Tupac's rage and the Outlawz, should not prevent any lover of rap from experiencing one of Tupac's best CDs. For any serious fan of Tupac this is a must have; along with \\"Me Against the World\\" and \\"All Eyez on Me\\" it completes the trilogy of Pac's best work and leaves us wondering what the next CD from Pac would have been like.
0767903862|5.0|This is one of those can't-put-down, laugh-out-loud types of books.  Although I have been to Australia, I wasn't aware of all the dangers that lurked there.  Bill Bryson can sure tickle the funny bone.  A must read for anyone who loves to laugh!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Moulin Rouge<br /> This is an awesome cd, and I THANK Baz Luhrman for doing it and the movie. Although I have yet to see the movie, I'm anxiously wanting to.<br />1. Nature Boy . David Bowie - The soundtrack begins with a small haunting piece of dialogue given by Ewan MecGregor, while in the background are haunting tunes. Then David Bowie begins to sing, and the background becomes stronger. It's an awesome, haunting song, and is no doubt used in the movie in a great way.<br />2. Lady Marmalade . Christina, Pink, Mya, Lil' Kim - I cannot express how much I love this song. The collaboration of these beautiful ladies' voices is wonderful, and not to mention very sexy. From Mya's soft, innocent voice to Christina's loud and perfect vocals, Lady Marmalade delivers each and every music taste you could hope for. Pink has a strong and worthy voice, and Lil' Kim gives us a bit of her rapping. Again, the collaboration of these sexy ladies was the only way to go with this song.<br />3. Because We Can . Fatboy Slim -  What do we always expect from master DJ Fatboy Slim? A fast, fun song that never slows down, and if it does, it's only to build up a great explosion in the song which gives you chills. Although the only lyrics consists of the words, Because We Can, everybody, and happy, the rhythmic beats keep the song way alive.<br />4. Sparkling Diamonds . Nicole Kidman - This song was the first time I ever heard Kidman sing, and I must say, I was surprised at well this lady can sing! She can go from being sexy to having a loud, strong voice. And all the time sounds like she's enjoying singing what she's singing. The song in itself is very fun, and full of girl power.  It mixes songs from great legends as Marilyn Monroe and Madonna, and does it well.<br />5. Rhythm of the Night . Valeria - I want to hear more from this girl! She sounds like a new Gloria Estifan. The Latin beats of Rhythm of the Night will keep you moving throughout the whole song.<br />6. Your Song . Ewan McGregor and Alessandro Safina - The soundtrack finally slows down after the previous fast beats with this ballad sang with great ease by McGregor. The operatic backgrounds supplied by Alessandro Safina go great with the song, and makes the song more powerful. The orchestra also gives the song a great feeling.<br />7. Children of the Revolution . Bono, Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer - Now we go from orchestric ballad to a hard rock song led by the great voices known for their rock. Children of the Revolution will make anyone go for something their willing to do. It's like a victory song, of sorts.<br />8. One Day I'll Fly Away . Nicole Kidman - Nicole shows us her sweeter, softer side in One Day I'll Fly Away. The song is soft on the ears, and so is Nicole's voice. I never could've imagined how good she can sing.<br />9. Diamond Dogs . Beck - I've never been a big fan of Beck's music, but Diamond Dogs is better than most of it. <br />10. Elephant Love Medley . Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Jamie Allen - I love this! It combines many great love songs from the past decade into a wonderful medley supplied by Nicole and Ewan's voices. These two have great talent. And neared to the end, the background is full of, I guess, Jamie Allen's operatic vocals, with Nicole and Ewan harmonizing together. It's wonderful.<br />11. Come What May . Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor- Another song with Nicole and Ewan. Although it doesn't live up to Elephant Love Medley, it's still great. It's more of a ballad here, and really shines.<br />12. El Tango de Roxanne . Ewan McGregor, Jose Feliciano and Jacek Koman - I can't wait to see how this song is done in the movie. Ewan really shows off his vocal skills here, and the tune to El Tango de Roxanne is great.<br />13. Complainte de la Butte . Rufus Wainright - A very soft, happy like song. The beginning of the song is sung in French, I believe. And the accent of Rufus Wainright is great.<br />14. Hindi Sad Diamonds . Nicole Kidman, John Leguizamo, and Alka Yagnik - This is one wild song! The beats are right out of India, and Nicole Kidman's voice is used superbly! It's a fast and wild song.<br />15. Nature Boy . David Bowie and Massive Attack - This is a remix of the first track, and is done to the tune of a more hard rock song than the first haunting tunes.<br /> Moulin Rouge marks itself as one of my favorite CDs, and will probably do the same to any fan of musicals, Nicole Kidman, or any music lover.
6305807086|4.0|Being John Malkovich's premise is horribly absurd, but provides for a very entertaining experience. The characters were a mixed bag. The only one I could truly sympathize with was Malkovich, who has more or less no control over his fate throughout. It seemed as though all others were in the gray area, where they were neither quite good nor evil. I would end up both disliking and pitying whomever was on the screen at the time. All and all it's a depressing, yet still comedic movie, worth buying.<br />Memorable scenes include John Cusack's performance to the little girl on the street, Malkovich entering his own mind, and the scenes from Malkovich's childhood (\\"I am bad... I am bad...\\")
B00005B36H|5.0|Ok, I have listened to this CD from beginning to end about 10 times and have come to full appreciate this brilliant piece of music.  At first, I was a bit overwhelmed I guess at the length of this record and the length of the songs, which required me to actually just sit down, relax, and just listen.  I would have to say now, that this is the best CD I have bought in 5 years.  I'm not going to explain and give my opinion on every one of the &quot;songs&quot; on this record because I think that none of the tracks on this CD were intended to be listened to alone, I think every song is a continuation of the last and you must listen to the entire thing to fully appreciate it.  Just buy this CD, and listen to it from the beginning to the end and enjoy.  To everyone who gave this album and bad review, forget about Tool, go listen to some Limp Bizkit, I don't want you to think too hard and end up hurting yourself.

The book itself, in the format it is written, is not only insightful, but understands how busy we are and gets to the point.  This book outlines the nuts and bolts and allows you to apply it right away. It's not that it is a new system, it is organized for you to put it to practical use. I am a husband, father of two, a long time entrepreneur and small business owner, I don't have the time to read a 300-page book on theory. I have made this one of our core training books for the entire company.  If you struggle with \\"not enough hours in the day\\" as I do, this book is for you.

014028009X|5.0|I recently reread this book (just prior to seeing the movie), and it was just as must a &quot;fun&quot; read as it was two years ago.  (The movie, however, is another story.)  Though I am no longer a &quot;singleton&quot; myself, I do remember what it was like, and boy did I never have as many misadventures as Bridget!<br />Reading this novel is like having an enjoyable vicarious experience (which is exactly what you'd expect from a good novel), even though sometimes you'd prefer not to be living Bridget's life.  This isn't feminist (nor anti-feminist) bashing -- it's just escapism set in the life of a slightly neurotic and highly insecure single woman in her thirties.  The fact that Helen Fielding has made us all like Bridget inspite of all her sitcom-ish predicaments, all the more makes me regard this book as one of the most enjoyable books that I have read in quite some time.

0684865130|4.0|Book Description The novel Catch-22 shows a unique view of World War II. The Story is told in third person and focuses on a colorful character named Yossarian.   It takes place in Italy during WWII.  The men in the squadron attempt to do their missions and survive.  However they keep getting caught in absurd rules that present a no-win situation.  The story unfold turning from hilarious comedy to a serious plot.  The book is very entertaining as the men try to beat the bureaucratic military system.<br />Review Catch-22 provides extreme entertainment and with a wonderful plot and hilarious comedy.  It is a classic satire.  It provides a new point of view for war, showing the craziness and absurdities of war.  The book starts off being kind of hard to follow with Heller's unique use of paradoxes and oxymoron's.  That plus the fact that the story is not told in chronological order makes it a little rough at first.  However once into the book it is one of the best books ever written.  <br />Catch-22 is a set of rules that the men in the airforce have to follow.  At first some of them are confusing and contradicting, but once the reader has a feeling for the style it becomes funny.  Everything contradicting everything else the characters soon go crazy.  If one wishes to find out what a catch-22 really is then should read this awesome book by Joseph Heller.
B000031XCR|1.0|After having wasted three whole years of my life listening to this seriously sugar-coated mess, I've had enough. A nice voice seriously goes ugly by screaming, and I'm afraid she could be hurting herself, pounding her navel like Tarzan's wife. And I'm not surprised that that song, &quot;My Heart Will Go On,&quot; had been seriously overplayed three or four years ago. HELLO? I USED TO LIKE THAT SONG? Why didn't James Horner choose another singer to sing MHWGO? Celine has been famous for singing other people's songs, not just her Barbra Streisand/Liza Minelli-esque style of singing. I don't get it at all.

B000021Y77|5.0|Every year I see countless flicks that pass for entertainment.  I see too many people going to see crap and liking it, but every year I also find something out there that brings back my faith in     talented filmmakers making good movies.  Run LOLA RUN is a really incredible film.  While not preying on petty emotions and cheap plot devices to involve the audience director Tykwer relies on something more important, he gives his film a vitality I rarely see in American film.  This move has a pulse.  We feel it in every seen and then there's that red hair.  I love this movie and  I try to get everyone I know to see it. Don't miss it.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya sings soo beautiful!  'Wild Child' is so cute, and seems to tell a story, in my opinion (and ethier I'm very imaginateve or very weird), of a orphange, and one little boy who feels alone. I know, the song doesn't exactly sound sad, but I get that feeling.  Some of her songs ARE sad though, and you get to picturing the saddest thoughts in your head.  Especially when 'Fallen Embers' starts playing: &quot;Once, as my heart remembers, all the stars were fallen embers, once, as my heart remembers, I was with you&quot;. SAD!! Anyway, this and all the rest of the songs are so GREAT! I want all of her CD's!!  I've reviewed The Best of Enya, and I said it there, but I'm going to say it again here.  This music really reminds of the video game music from FFVIII.  Like, 'Only Time' (I'm a Seifer liker..so this song and many other's 're his and someone elses), and 'Fallen Embers', and Wild Child (*wink*!). Mainly, they make me think what a wonderful sequel to FFVIII would be like, with Quisty and Seifer 2 gether. Back to the music!!  I know, it's strange about associating music with a &quot;dumb ol' video game&quot;, but I do it all the time, and it can easily be done with Enya's floaty rythim and beautiful lyrics that set the right mood for anything!!  'Lazy Day' actually doesn't make you feel lazy. It's full of such energy and pretty, memoriabal lyrics.   There are so many more songs I haven't talked about, but they are all so good!  If you liked: Paint the Sky With Stars:Best of Enya, get this CD, because it's just as good, if not a little better!!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I heard the song on the radio &quot;Thank you&quot;...so I took a chance going on that song and bought this CD. To say the least--I was very pleased.

B000002KDO|5.0|I did'nt grow up in a community where heavy metal was a great cultural influence (hiphop and go-go were), so I discovered this band about 9 years ago with this album and Sweet Leaf is the first tune I heard. I dug the distorted guitars and the vocals were in agreement with my current mindset. As I inspected  the whole document, I really took to Tony Iommi's heavy style which I recognized as the raw breed which so many bands 9 years ago were making their guitars sound like. Iommi is the father of Alice In Chains, White Zombie, Rage, Soundgarden, Pantera and too many to name who became popular 9 years ago. Now this album is a great influence on me because these brothers created a new meaner sounding earthy blues sound and it spoke about loving God and finding peace in a confusing and bloodthirsty world. Who could'nt dig that? God IS the only way to love, and I thank BHE for pointing out the fact that Sabbath are the farthest from satanic or evil, they are Superbad, however and every song on this album are lessons to musicians of my generation to create rock music with positivity and heavy guitars like Iommi.

B000007NYS|5.0|Koch Records insured their place in heaven with this re-release of Williams' brilliant 1988 LP.<br />&quot;Lucinda Williams&quot; bursts with emotion, from the realizations of \\"I Just Wanted to See You So Bad\\" and \\"Passionate Kisses\\" (a hit single for Mary-Chapin Carpenter) to the intimate introspection and naked self-awareness of \\"Am I Too Blue\\" and \\"Side of the Road.\\"<br />Williams is equally at home exploring her own stories of living and loving and leaving and losing as she is drawing keenly observed portraits of others. The emotions of her songs are palpable, perfectly supported by her band's seamless mixture of folk, country, blues and rock.<br />The reissue includes notes from Williams and a telling liner from her father, poet Miller Williams. Also included are six bonus tracks, including covers of early blues tunes and striking live takes of three Williams' songs, including the superb \\"Sundays.\\" Welcome additions all, but the original LP is a tough act to follow.

0061020680|5.0|Although Diskworld is well into the double digits for number of books in a series, it is actually made up of several sub-series.  Mort is the first book in a subset about Death on Discworld.  It can be read independantly of the rest of the series.  Death is a real person, not an event in this delightful book.  It launches a trilogy that includes such delightful characters as the Death of Rats, and Death's daughter.  Well worth the read.
B00004U8H4|4.0|American Psycho, in its literary form, is a difficult read, as it comes off as pure graphic exploitation.  The violence is so strong that many readers were blinded to the sporadic humour of the piece, often laugh out loud funny.  Happily, the film takes all the redeeming qualities of the novel and builds on them, creating another beast entirely.  The film plays as a black comedy, not horror. There is a little bloodshed for the Fangoria hounds here, but most of the violence is off screen, left to the dark pits of imagination.  Christian Bale gives a career making performance, making Patrick Bateman a ridiculous blend of Casey Casem and any masked axe wielding killer you could think of.  But most importantly the film acts as a satirical look at the cultural emptiness of the eighties, and the emptiness of Bateman.  Don't be afraid!  This is a great film just waiting to be discovered.

New territory includes not only the elements listed above but the format. Palahniuk has written all of his books in a fairly short format that really donesn't allow for much plot development.

Forgetting the others, although Sid Vicious's anctics did give The Sex Pistols a lot of media attention which would make kids notice them from magazines and T.V, this album quite possibly tops the greats such as &quot;Back In Black&quot; and &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot;, this punk defiant, hard hitting important piece of history was as important an album as Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts.  The punk era gave way to people who were not pretty or sex idols, nor could sing, but could write damn god songs.  Bob Dylan and Hendrix are the only people who stand aside The Sex Pistols and say if you have it, then go for it.<br />All songs on this album are gems, but most importantly, the album's message is like no other of its time, If you have something to express, then express it until the point when no-one wants to hear you no more, and once that is done, you have achieved something, and that is what this album did, Nirvana and Guns n Roses were to take this formula to new heights, but as always, the originals gets the most credit.
0446608955|5.0|Attention readers:  Invest in Kleenex!  After reading this book, you will know the reason.  Nicholas Sparks has such a gentle, sweet way with words.  I thoroughly enjoyed A Walk to Remember, this beautiful love story that pulled me in from the start and held me in rapt attention throughout.  So pull out your hankies and sit down for an enjoyable, emotionally charged read.<br />There was only one reason for 17-year-old high school Senior, Landon Carter, to enroll in Drama - a chance to take it easy for an hour.  Plus there was only one other boy in a class full of girls, a benefit of the highest degree.  Also in the class is Jamie Sullivan, the unpopular preacher's daughter who no one wants to hang around.  She is also the only girl left when it comes time for the homecoming dance.  Although not his first choice and the fact that he's running out of time, Landon asks Jamie to be his date.  Her agreement became the crucial moment, the pedal that got the wheel to spinning, the stepping stone to one of the most beautiful and courageous love stories ever written.<br />What a valuable lesson this novel serves to teach.  Those who may be different from us, status or otherwise, can be the most wonderful people to know.  Jamie Sullivan is a character that is pure in heart and would be such a joy to spend a day with.  There should be more people like her, and like Landon, a boy who took a chance on her and found a love unlike anything he'd ever known.  I applaud Nicholas Sparks for writing this bittersweet and uplifting story.  The time and tears spent on this novel was well worth it.
0767849493|2.0|Dogma has some funny moments and contains the kernel of a good film, but unfortunately these are lost in the loose direction and  slack editing.  There are quite a few plot problems and they are never really resolved properly. A few more months in the editing suite may have worked wonders for this film, but overall it was very disappointing. <br />Ed Wood would've been proud.
B000002OTL|5.0|This is the best soundtrack I own. And Pulp Fiction is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The music brought together on this Cd is outstanding, every song is great and the conversations... they are terrific. My favorite is Zed and Ezekiel. For those who haven't seen the movie it doesn't mean much but they should watch it and the buy this soundtrack. It is just like the movie - it has a feeling, something that I just can't express. That is what makes good music!<br />The performers are all good known ones and the majority of the songs were released long ago - Kool&amp;The Gang, Chuck Berry, Ricky Nelson, Dusty Springfield - and the rest that I haven't heard before became familiar with me after the first listening. I listened so much to this CD that it became scratched so I had to buy a new one!<br />If you haven't see the movie than go and watch it and right after buy this soundtrack CD. You won't regret it.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|I came into this movie with the idea that this would be a politically charged, fire and brimstone attack on the death penalty and what I came away from the movie was less a political story than a story of redemption and salvation and the implications on the soul that comes with it. Sean Penn delivers a powerful performance as a man angry with the world yet unable to come to grips, or deal with the crime he was involved with. A powerful movie and well worth a look at.
630326669X|5.0|...to see The Stones at work in a studio.  The fact that they're creating Sympathy For The Devil makes it even more special.  At the time these documentary images were captured, The Stones were one of the only acts allowed to compose without limits on studio time.  If you're not a die-hard fan skip it, but if you are a Stones disciple this is a must.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|this was one of the greatest movies ive ever seen. its smart funny and brilliantly made. its definitely one of the best movies ive ever seen
B00003BDXG|1.0|you will never see a film like &quot;natural born killers&quot; ever.  this is not nessescarily a compliment.<br />this film is pure drivel, an exercise in drug-induced hallucinations and unashamed overacting.  oliver stone will gladly say that the reason so many people hated this movie is because it contained radical political ideals that people cannot accept.<br />ha.<br />let's examine a few of the film's flaws now.  the editing bears an unnatural resemblence to the works of ed wood (yes friends, when oliver stone does it the world proclaims him genius).  the acting cannot be described as acting, as everyone here, (who are intended to be people that may just really exist), speak in unintelligible diolauge that no real person would succumb to saying, and act as if they have narcolepsy.  the most delicous irony of this comes when, in the deleted scenes area, when oliver stone says that he deleted the hun brothers sequence because they were &quot;overacting&quot;.  it turns out that the hun brothers act the most humane of any of the actors.  there are a series of pointless interludes that only serve to the film's incompetence, including one in which woody harrelson and juliette lewis visit an indian shaman and we get nothing out of the sequence other than some racial sterotypes and some irrelevant stock footage.  and i'm not even going to touch &quot;i love mallory&quot;.  the violence is way, way over-the-top, the prison riot sequence is horribly photographed, and the so-called &quot;media satire&quot; is nothing but a bunch of awful diolauge (including the ever-so-predictable &quot;i'm purer than you&quot; line) and really stupid symbolisim (the media-man dressed as the devil.  come on).<br />to some point you may want to see this film, with all the controversy surrounding it.  but there's no other reason to see it.  perhaps maybe it should've been banned in the states.  maybe 90s cinema wouldn't have been so pitiful then.
B00005B36H|5.0|Even from a band who constantly raises the bar of musical excellence, this is a little much. I've been a Tool listener for roughly three years, and I have to tell you, I didn't think they were capable of such precision, such emotion, such mastery of their craft. Before May 15th, I made it a point to cancle my other previously planned activities so I would be able to give all of my attention to what I will dare to call the Holy Grail of progresive music. It's a good thing I did, because it took me the entire day to even begin digesting this magnificent album. If you listen to one person in your life, listen to me. Buy this album. It is worth every penny. It is worth every minute we waited. Cold and unfeeling, yet sensitive and compassionate. Chaotic and spontaneous, yet orderly and calculated. Contradictive yet flowing. If you've been trying to find something to hold onto in the inconstant, unfeeling music industry of today, look no further than Lateralus. Within our lifetime, artistic genius will no longer be expressed through brush on canvas, and pencil on paper, but rather through music on compact disc, and Lateralus will emerge as the yardstick by which all such albums will be measured.
0345350499|5.0|I have read this book maybe 4 times, along with The Forest House and Lady of Avalon. You don't read a book this thick that many times if you don't absolutely LOVE it!! And I do, I do.. It's the story of Arthurian times, only told from the women's (and druids') point of view, mainly. The other books are prequels, of the centuries leading up to Morgaine and Arthur. And boy, am I excited to see that there's yet another Avalon book out, Priestess of Avalon. Mists will be coming out in movie form on TNT in July 2001, and that's another reason I'm hopping up and down! Being Wiccan myself, I really identified with the whole Goddess-priestess storyline. It really is too wonderful a book to reduce into a short synopsis. Let me just say that MZB has struck quite a chord in the pagan community, and may her books live on forever and ever! Blessed be!
B000007443|5.0|Especially I admired the last tune,Trio (An Improvisation). The music is really something-it is one of the most ideal Trio music,I think. At the beginning of Eliane Elias`s  part is very exciting, it makes me feel to see as if the world of the tune is going to develop just in front of me! Good music should be very,very visually attractive, and this is surely makes you feel so.
0385335482|4.0|Not really my kind of book this, but I won't get snobby about it. There are times when something light and fluffy is all your mind can take.<br />And for those times, you can't do much better than this. It has the air of an extended magazine article, but thankfully, one that's very well done, very sharp, really quite appealing.<br />I think it helps to be able to identify with the main character, so if you're one of those serious &quot;my finances are all in order thank you&quot; kind of people, you probably won't find this funny. But if you are occasionally, or often, overtaken by the desire to shop, and if you're a specialist in justifying it to yourself, you'll find it hilarious.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Ok Ok Ok I was anxious since Feb when the Release was postponed to April, Until the 20Th of May...... JEEEZ the best concert I ve ever seen! Rudess moving those finger as hell, Portnoy making pieces of those Drums, Petrucci slashing up that guitar with his great techniques, LaBire spitting his Lungs out and NEVER THOUGHT THAT MYUNG WOULD EVER DO THAT SOLO ON DANCE OF ETERNITY! YOU MUST BUY THIS DVD! The DVD edition has ACOS and A Mind Beside Itself and Ofcourse Learning To Live that is a killer song, Also dont miss their 3 cd LIVEALBUM in september of the Same concert, its a must have for your DT collection
B00003CXDZ|1.0|This was one of the worst movies that I have ever attempted to see.  1 star is much more than it deserves.  The ONLY thing good about this was the surprise that Ewan McGregor could sing.  At one point I actually had to plug my ears to keep them from bleeding.  The true hero of this movie was the &quot;consumption&quot; that ended the howling of Satine.  On a positive note no one can say Roxanne better than Jacek Koman.  Save your money.
B000002UHG|5.0|Anyone with a brain on their heads and just a little familier with The Pink Floyd will be aware that they were always at the forefront of the use of electronics in their music, molding their albums around perfect music and sound effects. Richard Wright's latest solo album, which he put out in 1996, was in production at a time when a new wave of electronic music was making its way up from the European underground, and since Rick worked the keyboards with The Floyd, he's no stranger to the electronic scene. His album, \\"Broken China\\", seamlessly blends his music stylings together, making for a sound effects-packed album of pure, melodious electronica. \\"Broken China\\" has so much going for it that its hard to grasp it all in a few listens.  Wright's not afraid to go off on spells that last a few minutes that only hold odd sound effects inserted, and dare i say, paranoid-inducing ambient music. And that's really good for the person who enjoys being taken to another place by music. Its hard to even refer to this as an album, its more like a project. Half of the album's 'songs' are instrumentals which just warp everything around them and may make you question what you got yourself into. But don't worry, its worth it. There's so much going on, yet its so completely off in its own little world, that its confusing for one to put their finger on just what makes it so great.
B00000AFFI|5.0|Polly Jean Harvey's fifth album is a nearly perfect achievement featuring some of her most masterfully constructed songs ever. A subtle and assaulting affair which will bewitch you from the first notes. Harvey has always been a visionary storyteller and here she goes one step further, fleshing her often sparse lyrics into tales of homicide, hope, abandonment and yes, desire. The lyrics are complimented by the noisy, brash sounds created by Flood, Head and Harvey herself which further the narrative and give each song a distinct sound of its own. A remarkable offering, and well worthy follow up to 1995s &quot;To Bring You My Love.&quot;
B00004XONN|3.0|I'll start off by saying that 'Kid A' is a good album.  It is interesting enough to keep me from getting too bored.  However, this music is not &quot;groundbreaking&quot;.  In fact, it's very derivitive.  This is nothing that Tricky, Massive Attack, Bjork, PJ Harvey, (the list goes ON and ON....) weren't doing 10 years ago.  I think that it is great that Radiohead are expanding their horizons, but to ditch the very elements that make them great in an attempt to become something they &quot;would like to be&quot; isn't going to cut it. (It's kind of like when Eric Clapton tried his hand at Reggae--Yeah, it sounded OK, but couldn't hold a candle to Bob Marley) It's obvious that Radiohead are big fans of the bands I listed previously.  That's fine.  But, 'Kid A' is basically a watered down Tricky album. Radiohead is an excellent rock band that has the ability to assimilate electronica into their brilliant songwriting.  However, in this album, they have abandoned their brilliant songwriting in favor of becoming something that they just can't do as well as the real genre innovators.   Do yourself a favor and listen to Tricky's 'Pre-Millenium Tension' or 'Maxinquaye', or even Massive Attack's 'Blue Lines' (Released in 1990, but still far more groundbreaking than Kid A.  Kind of shows you that Radiohead are a little late jumping on the boat with this stuff) 'OK Computer' was great because it was Radiohead being &quot;Radiohead influenced by electronica&quot;.  'Kid A' is Radiohead &quot;wishing desperately that they were a trip-hop group because they are huge fans of the genre and thought they would give it a try.&quot;  'Kid A' is good, but not all that memorable.  Definitely not a cornerstone in the history of rock, and DEFINITELY not original or groundbreaking.  People who think it is groundbreaking only do so because they are fans of rock that have never been exposed to Tricky, Bjork, Massive Attack, PJ Harvey, Portishead, yada yada yada.  The media needs to get out ofbed with this group.  By kissing their a$$es all the time, it is not inspiring them to be great.  I have a feeling that if Thom Yorke took a Pi$$, recorded it, threw in a drum beat, with some violin-synth swelling, the press would say that it was the most inventive thing ever recorded.  This is sad, because until this love affair is over, Radiohead will continue to spin it's wheels.
B000001DYD|5.0|A work of cathartic beauty and startling raw exhilaration, showcasing the dark beauty, anger and rage that dwells between the surface of every affair, breakup, seduction or romance. One of PJ's finest albums, it includes uncompromising visions and scorching imagery. Some of the songs can be found in better format on 4-TRACK DEMOS while other tracks are exclusive to this disc. Essential listening material best appreciated alongside 4-TRACK DEMOS.
B000059Z8J|5.0|&quot;Superman:The Movie&quot; is a tremendously magical fantasy that delivers the imagination in those who really believe a man can fly.23 years after its release,the acting,story,cast and special effects hasn't lost its touch.The restoration of this film is the most pleasing I have seen and it's a thrill to watch the film in its original widescreen format.Christopher Reeve is a delight to watch.I love the screen tests and the theatrical trailer.
B00004YW6I|3.0|Typically I would give any album five stars on the mere pretense of being created by Miss Harvey. Yet after her astonishing 1998 effort &quot;Is This Desire?&quot; and a batch of strong reviews lamenting this album a masterpiece I must admit to a degree of disappointment.   The record starts splendidly with &quot;Big Exit&quot; (a rip-roaring journey into violence and dissatisfaction) &quot;Good Fortune&quot; (Chinatown, Little Italy, Bonnie and Clyde references) and &quot;A Place Called Home&quot; (the ghostly single) and settles into a discreet, soft groove. Songs such as &quot;One Line,&quot; &quot;Beautiful Feeling,&quot; &quot;This Mess We're In,&quot; and &quot;Horses In My Dreams&quot; are lyrically and rhythmically interchangeable while &quot;The Whores Hustle and The Hustler's Whore,&quot; &quot;Kamikaze,&quot; &quot;This Is Love,&quot; and &quot;We Float,&quot; leave hints of a far more superior CD.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|The music was a wonderful composition of earlier realeses to latest hits.  Nicole Kidman can actually sing!  This was surprising to me.  The movie was also wonderful and very entertaining.  Watching the new rendition of Roxanne was definately worth my [money].  The whole movie and soundtrack has so much climax and emotion it's hard to tell where you end and the music begins.
078324228X|5.0|Great works of art give us a glimpse of the meaning to life.  Here's a quote from a friend: &quot;Finally I watched The Hurricane and now I feel really bad about not having watched it earlier. I resisted watching it for a long time and now I feel like one of the ignorant people who never bought his book and read his story.\\"<br />I must for the collection.
B0000028RR|5.0|Music with a message is nothing new. Almost everything ever committed to tape has some meaning within it. That said; This debut release takes this concept to a level uncharted. &quot;Rage&quot; brings us music so ripe with unbending noncompliance that one can become completely incensed with the injustices of our world just by listening. This is more than just music. This is social commentary; Political protest; Intelligent ire, and righteous indignation. All backed up with a passion hard to find anywhere else. As for the music: Dazzling in its intensity, and tight as they come. Incorporating the best elements of Rap and Heavy Metal, linking it with some of the most righteous guitar work I've heard in years. My favorite tracks are &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;, &quot;Settle for Nothing&quot;, &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot;, and &quot;Fistful of Steel&quot;. All of which carry the message to &quot;Wake Up&quot; and see the world for what it is. This disc really pisses me off, and I love every minute of it. This band is not only talented, but well educated to boot. Buy this disc first; then buy the rest of their catalog. Listen and learn; then take action in your own life to help change this planet for the better.
B00003CWTI|5.0|...but failed...The film succeeds brilliantly...clever, complex, and compelling...something to think about for days after....
0375703764|3.0|The story may be an enigma but so is the book iself.  In the beginning, you get the sense the author is really screwing with your head and, frankly, he does a good job of it.  Unfortunately, that sense of morbid manipulation goes out the window as the book gets drowned out by it's own chaos.  As many reviewers have already mentioned, the book has tons of footnotes, odd pages with almost no text, text in tight columns, etc.  At first I thought it was ok because he's trying to communicate the insanity taking hold over Truant or Zampano but I just became frustrated with it after a while.  It becomes too much work to read this book.  <br />Perhaps Danielewski is too ahead of the times or I'm too far behind the times, but I prefer to read something that's easier to read.  I loved the fact that he was challenging my mind in the beginning but I don't want to be challenged because of the book format.  I know it was meant as a device to communicate the loss of sanity and perhaps to play with my sanity but all it did was (...) me off.<br />That aside, there was some truely brilliant writing in the book and I hope to see more from him.  Many people may not realize it but he's Poe's (the musician) brother.  She's just as creative musically as he is in his writing.  A talented pair...it will be intersting to see where they go.
B000059MEK|4.0|I hate the stuff. &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; was good as a movie, but, yet, I would not go out and buy the soundtrack. Yet Daft Punk's &quot;Discovery&quot; is different -- you can definetly tell that some of it is inspired by horrible... er.. retched disco, but they create the music coming out of your headphones in such a lovely matter. And some of the sounds on this album are nice, plain and simple. I personally hate the first song, the much liked and also booed &quot;One More Time.&quot; Ech. I can't stand the vocals, and if you notice, the singer lets out an unneeded burst of air through his voice after each line(&quot;Music and dancing so free - ahh.&quot;). But, hey, there's this awesome happy and cool growing background music. If they left it alone, it wouldn't suck as much as it does.<br />But then you get to &quot;Aerodynamic,&quot; and all your hopes are resurrected. It is the reason I bought this album (watched the video on MTV2). It's simply incredible. It grows with this, amazing, completely catchy melody, and the beats always get harder. Then, this cool space-like guitar comes in. It's great, not as bad as it might sound.<br />&quot;Digital Love&quot; is great -- it's a pretty nice song, catchy, and always makes me smile. &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; is a nice track too. It gets going soon enough, and the computer-made lyrics completely add much needed thought into the song.<br />&quot;Crescendolls&quot; is, personally, the best song on the whole entire album. It is so amazing. Listen to the sample -- it's so odd, it sounds like something from an infomercial. It's great stuff. And, nicely, everything is actually good on this album except for a few tracks. &quot;High Life&quot; is a bit too much disco for me. &quot;Too Long&quot; is exactly that. ...For some reason, I can't stand the vocals (sadly). Still, this album is definetly worth a buy. It's one of the most happy albums that has come out in awhile. Nothing negative comes out of themusic.
B00005B36H|5.0|LATERALUS is, by far, the best album to have been released since....well, since AEnima.  Tool have done it again.  They have made an amazing record full, not of songs, but of suites.  This album gives hard music new depth which, personally, I've never heard before.  It rises up and beyond anything TOOL have ever done.  These are masterful compositions, almost orchestratic, pulling the listener in and drowning him/her in sensation.  That may sound a little extravagant, but it's the truth.  Simply put, this album rocks.  I have a LOT of cd's in my collection....for the past five years AEnima had been at the top of the list...now it has to share the spotlight.
0440180295|5.0|This was a really cool book.  It's a humorous account of a soldier's passive trip through war and consequently, the rest of his life.  Vonnegut pretends to give us an deconstructed time and plot structure, while he is actually giving us a pretty conventional one.  Nevetheless, I found it pretty clever.  I know that Vonnegut is supposedly a moral writer, but I don't think that this book needs to be read as such.  I think it's what you make of it.  Slaughterhouse Five is always fun, never truly sad - this is what makes it clever.  I think Vonnegut took a risk by creating a story in which commonly sad and depressing things are dismissed as trivial, but of course the author clearly doesn't believe they are.  His statements are about war, not pronouncements on the vagueries of the &quot;the human condition.&quot;
B00003CXDZ|5.0|The new diabolical movie is out! It's the movie everyone should rush to the cinema to see! Yes, Moulin Rouge! Wow, just see how enthusiastic a movie can make you? It'll make you tingle with excitement and flutter with joy? That is the kind of feeling you get when you're watching Moulin Rouge, a endlessly enjoyable piece of filmmaking from Baz Luhrmann, who bought us the similar Romeo + Juliet in 1996. Luhrmann has created with his script and his immaculate direction a near-perfect slice of grand cinema. Nicole Kidman's performance is stunning, its about time she got a role like this, the actress hasn't been so good or so daring since To Die For. Ewan McGregor is also his best in ages, lighting up off-screen with his narration and sparkling when he's acting on-screen. The costumes are delicious, the makeup is eye-catching, the editing is fabulous and the cinematography is just beautiful. What's wrong? Maybe they just used too many good songs at the start, the music started to sort of fade at the end. But that is not a problem you should worry too much about, because this isn't really a tale of music, it's a story of love above all things.
6304602979|5.0|this movie is sick! (hip hop slang for really really good!).this makes  &quot;romeo must die&quot; look like a mtv video! best actor award should go to that black dude that played in &quot;soul food&quot; , when he got shot at the end,he died hella good.BaLki was the funniest.but the best part was actually when Christopher Walken and whuts his name? (dennis hopper?) faced off! this scene is better than the scene with Ray liotta and joe pesci in &quot;gfellas&quot;.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|The opening of Moulin Rouge can only be described as electrifying, intensely eye-catching and dazzling! The music, dance, movement and colourful costumes are just amazing and the most glamourous is Nicole Kidman's first appearance and rendition of Diamonds are a girls best friend. The story is somewhat modern but the music would have to be one of the best features, and brings the film to life. Nicole and Ewan's vocals are stunning but my favourite would have to be the costumes; corsets and suspenders underneath beautiful ball gown-style dresses reflecting the glamour of Paris 1899. The love story element may appear to be soppy to some but although the ending is already revealed to you early in the film, the intensity of the final few minutes (after a spectacular show featuring a wonderful performance by both Nicole and Ewan) was enough to leave everyone in the cinema totally speechless, tears in the eyes. Moulin Rouge would have to be one of the best films I have ever seen and Baz Luhrmann is to be congratulated for his work. Ewan's performance was wonderful and it's hard to find a word suitable to describe Nicole's dazzling and unmatchable performance as Satine. Both the director and star turned in wonderful efforts and are both admired and applauded by fellow Australians/Fans. If you haven't seen it or have doubts I urge you to see this faboulous musical film spectacular!
B000002N3N|5.0|A clasically-styled and introverted album, Memory of Trees is a masterpiece of subtlety.  Many of the songs have an endearing shyness to them - soft piano and a lovely, quiet voice.  But within every introvert is an inferno, and Enya lets that fire explode on a couple of songs that absolutely burst with an expected raw power.  <br />If you've never heard Enya before, you might want to start with one of her more popularized works, like Watermark, just to play it safe.  But if you're already a fan, then your collection is not complete without this beautiful work of musical art.
B00001OH7U|5.0|David Bowie has a lot of inconsistent albums but this one is a welcome surprise.  It is great from the awesome title track to the rather melodramatic closer.  The title track is almost like two separate songs and is great.  I've heard it lots of times and always find something new to appreciate about it.  There are also a number of other great songs including Golden Years, TVC15 and Stay.  Highly recommended.
B000002LGW|5.0|This CD is a must for any DM fan. This CD is more than a compilation though; don't buy it with the intentions of having a full collection from this, for that you would need The Singles 1&amp;2, this album is more along the lines of a compilation containing all of Depeche Mode's pre-Violator songs with the added emotion of a live audience. It is very hard to explain and describe, you just have to hear it for yourself. The most amazing thing I have ever heard would have to be the grand finale, Everything Counts. There is something very eerie that strikes a chord with you when the entire crowd begins to sing along. It's sheer brilliance. This CD is definitely five-stars and is most certainly worth your money.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I absolutely loved this film.  Unfortunately, I did not see it in a New York theatre like the other reviewers.  If you are not seeing this in a city that has residents that do not appreciate this type of art you may find yourself the odd one out.  I had to endure supercilious comments from the audience, but I watched as best I could.  I recommend this movie to anyone who is able to look at the use of popular music in a movie set in the 1900's as an adventure.  The visuals are a feast for the senses and the music only adds to the enjoyment.  I have already asked amazon.com to inform me when this is released on DVD so I can watch it in the privacy of my home without any interruptions.
B00005B36H|5.0|Oh, how I used to hate when critics would lump Tool in with the likes of lunkheaded morons like Limp Bizkit or Korn. At least Fred Durst was smart enough to admit that he's not even in the same league. Tool is, and always will be, a thinking man's metal band, who convey the intensity of their music through extreme patience and discipline. Where most metal bands think intensity is simply to chug away on a detuned D bar chord cranked to 11, Tool enhances the power of their music through their subtlety as well as their energy, proving that less is more and making the high energy passages that much more powerful. They understand the power of dynamics better than anyone, and their music will suck you in. Lateralus is not a radical departure from Aenima, but it is a logical one, as Tool continues to bring greater depth to their music.<br />Lie back on your bed, close your eyes, put on the CD headphones, and listen to this one from beginning to end for the ride of your life.
B00005JG6R|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece. I am a major anime fan, and this is my favorite anime. It is my favorite movie really. This is the reason why anime became so popular in America in the first place, and I can see why. It tells the story of Tetsuo and Kaneda. They were childhood friends, yet Kaneda always protected Tetsuo. This got Tetsuo pissed, because he didn't want a reputation as a wimp. Tetsuo has a motorcycle accident when he runs ahead of the other gang members to chase a member of the  Clowns (One of the rival gangs). Government officials airlift him away, and experiment with him. From these experiments he gains psychic powers.......<br />The animation is unique, and wonderful. Not like most of the animation in Nickelodeon, (Those make me puke!) and most American cartooons. The movie makes you think as well. It is chock full of symbolism. The story is original, and progresses without boring you. The characters are all individual, and you hate your bad guys(I can't stand the rabbit-toothed midget who died of a heart attack), unlike most animes which in them, the coolest characters are the bad guys(Not that that's a bad thing ^-^).<br />Even if you are not an anime fan, you'll love it. My favorite fight scenes were the ones on motorcycles. If you want more Akira knowledge, I recommend the manga, which is much longer. It has been said that this anime is extremly violent, but it is not. I have seen a ton of real movies that are more violent. America is just used to cartoons being for kids, and the rating companies tend to exaggerate. <br />I feel sorry for Tetsuo, and Kaori at the end (Stupid meddling mutant kids had to interfere, and Tetsuo could have been the most powerful being in the universe), and it is kind of sad. <br />Also recommended, Ninja Scroll, Princess Mononoke, Blood Reign: Curse of the Yoma, and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Those are all great animes.
0800103661|4.0|Andrew Niccol, who wrote the screenplay for The Truman Show (1998), directs this superior sci-fi from his own script.  The result is a well-plotted, character-driven science fiction thriller for intelligent viewers, a pleasing combination of worthiness not always associated with the genre.  This is science fiction that will play with mainstream audiences as well as with afficionados.  From Michael Nyman's beautiful and complementary musical score to the clever opening credits in which the letter codes, &quot;g, a, t, c&quot; (for the chemical bases of DNA--thus the movie's title) shimmer and glow in the names of those credited, everything in the movie is professionally done.  There is little violence and virtually no sex.  I would say this is a perfect flick for the kids except for the embedded &quot;ads&quot; for cigarettes and booze that mar some of the early scenes.<br />Ethan Hawke stars as the genetically-challenged Vincent Freeman, an &quot;In-Valid&quot; conceived in the back seat of a Buick Riviera instead of through the fine art of the genetic engineers who now dominate society.  His dream is to go into space, but his genes, in this meritocracy based on genetic endowment, fit him only for cleaning the bathrooms.  Yet he has a monstrous drive to succeed, and when he strikes a deal with the genetically superior Jerome Morrow, a &quot;valid&quot; who is in a wheel chair with paralyzed legs, to use his identity, body fluids, hair samples and urine to fool the genetic screening devices of the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, he is ready to fulfill his dream.<br />Uma Thurman plays his love interest.  Her statuesque beauty and her exotic features are perfect for the part of a futuristic babe in a retro fifties landscape of gray flanneled over achievers.  (Actually they aren't gray in dress, but in their uniform adherence to the corporate mentality.)  Jude Law as Jerome, the wheel-chair bound &quot;Valid,&quot; is perhaps the star performer, bringing subtlety and a bitter, but somehow uplifting verisimilitude to the role.  A puffed up Gore Vidal (who incidentally once wrote, &quot;after forty the death watch&quot;) is Director Josef, and Alan Arkin is a street wise homicide investigator from another era.<br />The interesting question asked by this movie is, could a caste system based on genetic endowment be our future?  My vision of the future is that of a &quot;brown society&quot; in which everyone strives to be the same, but in which small subtle differences of appearance are increasingly appreciated.  If every movie star looked like, say Jennifer Lopez, however beautiful she is, I would nonetheless find particular delight in a Pen&eacute;lope Cruz or an occasional Reese Witherspoon.  This sort of pressure would keep some variety in the gene pool.  I also think that a society in which the genetic endowment of its members is too widely separated can only lead to class hatreds resulting in violent conflict and ultimately genocide, most likely by fiat, so that the survivors will be genetically rather similar.  Possibly humanoid types will be genetically engineered to do the baser work of society.  These creatures may be thought of as organic robots, not as bonafide members of society, thereby raising another question, what is it to be human?  A society greatly stratified in terms of wealth can exist, as the present society shows, but a society in which the difference between haves and the have-nots is too great is not stable and eventually leads to revolution (there being a limit to the number of people that can be put in prison).  Furthermore, as this movie suggests, just which qualities of character, appearance and/or ability are the most valuable?  And when such qualities become abundant, might we then have a need for other qualities now made scarce?  Finally, as is asked of the notion of I.Q: &quot;intelligence for what?&quot;  Is it more powerful in an evolutionary sense to be &quot;intelligent&quot; or to be healthy?  Isit more adaptive to have a powerful drive to succeed, or a powerful urge to procreate?  Tough questions that the very talented Andrew Niccol might consider when making his next movie.e adaptive to have a powerful drive to succeed, or a powerful urge to procreate?

B000002J09|5.0|An album that is sort of a primer for all those who want to understand how good (and diverse) rock can be.  It is also an essential album of our lives, containing &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot;  How many high school dances ended with &quot;Stairway to Heaven?&quot;  (How ironic is it to end a high school dance with a song about suicide?  But that's another story.)  The first four tracks are stellar.  Not only &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; but two totally dissimilar rockers in &quot;Black Dog&quot; and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; kick the album into high gear before mellowing out a bit into &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; and then the aforementioned classic.  The next three tracks are all good, but nothing on side two (from album days) matches the first four tracks until you get to &quot;When the Levee Breaks.&quot;  While &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; quite deservedly gets all the hype, this is the track that cements this album as one of the greatest of all time.  It's a tough, grinding blues track (with a harmonica solo intro that I'll gladly carry with me forever) that brings back memories of the bluesier numbers from Led Zeppelin I.
B000007U5G|5.0|Como fan de Deep Purple, conozco la mayora de trabajos de los ex integrantes del grupo. Sin embargo, el estilo funk-jazz de Glenn Hughes no es mi fuerte. Asi que al desbandarse el grupo en 1976 fu l al nico al que no le segu la pista.   Ahora, 25 aos despus escucho este disco y realmente me ha impactado. Desde los primeros momentos del CD sent un escalofro por todo mi cuerpo, ese tipo de escalofros que solo te dn cuando recuerdas algo muy tuyo, muy intenso. Cada vez que escuchaba los viejos temas de Deep Purple volva esa sensacin y el gusto de escuchar a un Glenn Hughes maduro, fuerte, enrgico, seguro de s mismo y con un excelente grupo de msicos acompaandolo. Disfrut sobre todo la lnea Hard Rock que maneja ahora, aunque el estilo funky que lo caracteriza tambin fue de mi agrado. Este CD es ahora uno de mis favoritos. Lo recomiendo ampliamente y ms para los fans de Deep Purple y de Glenn Hughes. Ojal que Glenn siga activo y &quot;limpio&quot; y que contine as de fuerte como lo encontr en este CD.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Tom Hanks is a magnificent actor. Forget the beginning and ending of the movie. Skip to the plane crash and just watch an artist at work as he is stranded on the island. I could have watched hours of Hanks as the castaway. This movie should be required viewing for anyone interested in a career as an actor. This is not the best movie ever made but it is certainly one of the best screen performances to date.
B000002KDW|5.0|A Nod Is As Good As A Wink is a GREAT album!!  &quot;Miss Judy's Farm&quot;, &quot;Stay With Me&quot;, and &quot;Too Bad&quot; rock HARD! Ron Wood's Guitar intro to &quot;That's All You Need&quot; is AMAZING! The intro to the song &quot;Too Bad&quot;, is a great Rock moment! Legendary Band, Classic Album! You Should Hear It! Not one weak song here. I would easily recommend this album to fans of Rod Stewart's masterpiece &quot;Every Picture Tells A Story&quot;.  I hope this album is REMASTERED in the near future. It deserves it.
B000002MJ0|5.0|My Bloody Valentine have gone the way of the Beatles now, disintegrating before we ever had a chance to hear thier full potential. However, they did leave us with two remarkable albums &quot;Loveless&quot; and &quot;Isn't Anything&quot;. While &quot;Loveless&quot;, with its aural soundscapes, provided the soundtrack for flying straight into the sun and being blinded by it, &quot;Isn't Anything&quot; was something different. While it is a hazy, lush, and dense record, thier is also obvious pop hooks here. Now don't get me wrong, that is definetly not what makes this album better than &quot;Loveless&quot;, rather it is the fact that MBV manage to find a comfortable middle ground between thier jangly pop melodies of the past, and thier eccentric experimentation of the future. The album kicks off with the persistent snare drum of 'Soft as Snow (But Warm Inside)' with Kevin Shields singing while Belinda Butcher coos in the background. Meanwhile, in a total 180 degree flip of genteel yet haunting tracks such as 'Lose My Breath' and 'Cupid Come' are the raging noise rockers like 'Feed Me With Your Kiss' and 'Sueisfine'. Other notable tracks that contribute to the feeling of a rainy day in England are 'You Never Should', 'Nothing Much To Lose', and 'I Can See It (But I Can't Feel It)'. All in all, the only thing you can say about &quot;Isn't Anything&quot; is that it definetly is something, and that it definetly requires your attention now.

1884822312|5.0|The first thing to note is that this is book has a decent 'weight vs. price' ratio.  The second nice thing is that yes, this was written by the father of the famous Polgar sisters.<br />This book is approximately 85% chess problems and of that, about 15% mate in one, 60% mate in two, and 25% mate in three +.  The problems basically consist of a picture of a chess board and you have to find the mating move(s).  This book is excellent for what it is - a book of problems and solutions.  It helps you visualize what mate looks like, trains your eye to recognize forcing moves and tactics, and keeps your mind always on the ultimate goal.  I kept noticing that after reading this book for a while and then playing a few games, that I could feel my thoughts heading more directly to mating strategies and potential sacrifices etc.<br />I've given this book 5 stars because it does exactly what it's supposed to do.  If you want a book on openings or chess analysis, this obviously isn't the book for you.
0441172717|5.0|Before I start this review, i would like to say that i am 14 years old, and I think that everybody should read this book.  <br />Dune is set on the desert planet of Arrakis.  Arrakis a wasteland but has one thing on it more valuable then gold: spice. The spice is the most important thing in the whole universe.  The spice gives the Spacing Guild(the monopoly on intersteller travel) the ability to transport from planet to planet.  <br />For years the Harkonans had ruled Arrakis.  Now there is a new House in command: the Atradies (sorry I can't spell).  The Atradies have become so popular that they have aroused the jealously of even the Emporer of the Universe himself.  A plot to destroy the Atradies begins...<br />Young Paul Atradies manages to escape when the Haekonens and Imperial Troops arive.  He learns to live off of the desert with the Fremen.  The Fremen are what make this book great.  The imagination that it must have taken to create such a people is beyond comprehension.  Paul learns that he is a vital part of the Fremen religion. He is the voice from the out world.  He will lead them to paradise.  Paul raises the Fremen into and army to avenge the wrong made on his family by the Harkonens and Emporer.  Paul also learns that he might be the Kwisatz Hatderatch(The result of years of manipulated breeding by the Bene Geseret and the &quot;One who can be many places at once.&quot; The Bene Geseret are somewhat like a religous order dedicated to making the Kwisatz Haderratch)<br />Dune is complex but that is what makes it so great.  The plot is so thick you can feel the tension and emotion between the characters.  There are times of nothing more then conversation where I still was not bored.  This book is writen beter then anything I have ever heard or read.  There is also a movie based on this book that is worth seeing.
B000056HOZ|4.0|Some good points made in previous reviews on the missed potential for including additional stuff (commentary, other performances, etc.)in this 2 DVD set, but it is very nice to have all the videos in this format for long time fans and newbies alike. Comments on the quality of the surround sound may be a bit overstated and compares apples to oranges when comparing it to the Eagles Hell Freezes Over DVD (that show was miked and recorded with digital sound in mind). Knowing how much Bruce cares about the products he produces, I'm sure the audio engineers did the best they could considering the wide variety of analog source material. If you have a decent home theater setup that includes an A/V receiver with a variety of DSP (Digital Sound Processing) modes, you will find one that that sounds fine.
B00005BJC7|5.0|This cd is amazing to say the least.  The begining starts off to be more ambient and techno oriented like Kid-A.  But as soon as it hits track 6-Knives Out, it sounds like OK Computer and the Bends.  It's not a total copy of those cd's, but it just relates more to those cd's.  When it gets to tracks 9-11 (the last 3 tracks) you hear something different.  It doesn't sound like older Radiohead or Kid-A, it's yet another re-invention of the band.  Track 9 is totally instrumental.  It reminds me a lot of the &quot;Dead Man&quot; soundtrack.  It's a really nice song.  Track 10 is impossible to explain.  It's just &quot;different&quot;.  Track 11 is also really strange.  It has a trumpet playing and it's really slow-paced.  So basically, you see 3 different sides of the band on this cd.  Personally, my favorite song was track 5-I Might Be Wrong.  It's a combination of techno-ambient-and rock and roll.  The guitar in the song mixed with the techno drums and the echoing voice of Thom is such a great combination.  The Special Edition book is pretty cool too.  It resembles a library book.  It has a card with dates from the future.  It's something original that you'd expect from Radiohead.  It's not worth the extra money unless you're a true fan.  But if you're a fan of Radiohead, or looking to be a fan; I would recommend this cd the most because it touches upon all of their styles.  If this cd doesn't win multiple awards this year, then there's seriously somthing wrong with the judges.
B00005B4GU|3.0|If you made it this far, then you're already going to buy Amnesiac so...  Since the songs were recorded during Kid A they sound very similar to that album, but the surprise of Amnesiac is that it incorporates more standard guitar and drum sections.  The problem with Amnesiac, since it is composed of leftovers, is the lack of consistency on the album.  There is also the feel that perhaps Radiohead have tried too hard to be different and end up sounding the same.  Amnesiac would have made a far better double cd with Kid A, than as a seperate cd release.  Fans expecting something new(which is what Radiohead prides itself in producing right?) will be disappointed.  For those want something new, Thom's work on PJ Harvey's album, Stories...is great.  Amnesiac is a decent record but the real questions Radiohead fans want to know is what direction will they go next....
B00005IBGQ|4.0|Rufus Wainwright continues to reincarnate Tin Pan Alley standards with well-crafted, smart, and at times Beatlesque pop songs that grow richer upon repeated listens. The record is chock-full of instrumentation, as the last album was, and the producers (Pierre Marchand, Damian leGassick, and Alex Gifford) do a fantastic job of layering instrumentation for a full-but-not-cluttered sound.<br />Many of the songs on &quot;Poses&quot; still mine the ground of the pessimistic romantic. On &quot;California,&quot; our hero is so overwhelmed (or underwhelmed) by the possibilities the Sunshine State holds, &quot;that I think I'll stay in bed ...that I think I'll sleep instead.&quot; Or, as he resignedly states on the title cut, &quot;Life is a game, and true love is a trophy.&quot; The best moment on the album, though, is &quot;One Man Guy,&quot; Rufus's cover of his father's classic.  It's a brilliant song, and Rufus does it every justice.<br />Visit my full review at tapioca.net.
B000009CEM|5.0|Fear Factory's Obsolete is an excellent album. It is so very aggressive, but there are also moments that show that the guys in Fear Factory want to be respected as being great songwriters.The ninth track, &quot;Resurection&quot; shows that they have the ability to write some really great, powerful music. Burton C.Bell's vocals are unbelievable...man, they go from growling to almost gothic singing, great. Dino Cazares' guitar playing is heavy as hell. Christian Wolbers' bass is excellent...and Raymond Hererra's drumming...can be summed up in word word...UNBELIEVABLE.Listen to &quot;Hi Tech Hate&quot; or &quot;Securitron&quot; and you will witness tha power of FEAR FACTORY. I met Burton Bell and Dino and they were really cool guys, buy this cd. The new one, Digimortal is really good, but just not as powerful as this cd. This is the best metal cd I've ever heard. Buy this. Buy this now. Listen to it really loud on a really good sounding stereo. See them live, they're incredible.
6302054982|5.0|All of the characters (and I do mean all of them-there's a lot) do an excellent job in their rolls. I was especially impressed with Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco (who's one of my favorite actresses) as Henry and Karen Hill. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino are equally superb in the parts they play too. Even the lesser characters and people in the background give it their all.  Truthfully, I didn't think this movie was all that violent. There's a few scences, but the main controversy is by far the language.  It moves along so nicely that you don't even really notice how long it is. The music fits perfectly with each and every scene. From the beginning credits to the end credits the soundtrack is awesome.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|This movie fails to describe the main Argument and doesn't follow any stroy.  It is filled with modern music and fast camera movements whcih distracts viewers from concentarting on the subject.  This movie is not worth the 1 hr and 30 minutes that it demands from the audience.  It is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen!

B000002UTY|5.0|Quicksilver Messenger Service has always been one of those bands that I've had a love hate affair with. There were times this band would pull off a high flying improvosational guitar act that could rival anything that's ever been done. Then there were times that they would fly off the handle and go into some spacey and experimental noise that only a person on an LSD trip in the late 60's could appreciate. That's pretty much the story of &quot;Happy Trails&quot;. This album starts out with &quot;Who DO You Love&quot;, which was actually edited down to 25 minutes from the original live performance. The first half of this song is remarkable. After starting out with that familiar Bo Diddley beat, they change rhythm and go into a great guitar jam that has a few jazz overtones thrown in for good measure. Really cool stuff, especially for 1969. On the second half of this song they start trippin' out and go into their psychedelic thang for what seems like an eternity. Then they eventually get back on track and bring it back home with that familiar Diddley beat and some screamin' guitar work to end the song. This is a great tune that deserves a hard listen despite all the filler noise. Quicksilver continues to jones on Diddley with the next song &quot;Mona&quot;. Another good tune that continues that chunka chunka Bo Diddley beat and some great smouldering guitar work. It doesn't get much better than these two tunes. The other remaining songs &quot;Maiden Of The Cancer Moon&quot; and &quot;Calvary&quot; are pretty much more psychedelic workouts, although &quot;Calvary&quot; does have a cool Spanish guitar with a bolero beat in the middle of it that deserves a listen. But the strength of this album is &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; and &quot;Mona&quot;, which make up about 3/4 of this record. This is pretty much a listen straight through album, with the only interlude coming between what was originally side 1 and side 2. If your looking for some excellent guitar playing look nofurther than &quot;Happy Trails&quot;. When this band was on their game, as on here, they could easily surpass some of their better known peers of the San Francisco rock scene, such as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead. Happy Trails is a nice piece of late 60's originality that rock fans of that era should enjoy.

B000002AH1|5.0|Miles Davis' &quot;Live-Evil&quot; is a truly amazing, beautiful album which alternates between long, funky jams, and eerie tone poems. It is probably the greatest live fusion album ever recorded. Recorded live at the Cellar Door, Washington D.C. in December 1970, Miles and his band never play a wrong note. If not that, they never play a right note. This music was so new at the time, the audience probably all had their jaws wide open. Miles is in top form with his trumpet(w/ wah-wah most of the time), Jack DeJohnette plays some of the most amazing drums you'll ever hear.You can hear Keith Jarrett, doubling on organ and fender rhodes,starting to really create his style of keyboard playing. Michael Henderson plays some very soulful, funky bass, and Airto is always banging or shaking something. And to add to all that John McLaughlin(who was just sitting in!)plays the most incredible guitar ever recorded. Highlights of the live show include the opener &quot;Sivad,&quot; the energetic &quot;What I Say&quot;(listen to that drumming!), and the closer &quot;Inamorata and Narration.&quot; This band was incredible, and could beat the hell out of every other band live, when it comes to musical ablitiy, and volume! In fact it was so loud Keith Jarrett has never played an electric instrument since!Besides the live tracks, there are some eerie little tone poems. &quot;Little Church&quot; has a beautiful melody played by Miles and doubled by Hermato Pascoal's whistle. The two sister pieces &quot;Nem Um Talvez,&quot; and &quot;Selim&quot; are also scary and beautiful. The only throw away would be &quot;Gemini-Double Image.&quot; Although it has some awesome guitar, it doesn't really go anywhere. It doesn't really fit in with the album, so I always skip it. Besides the live players, Steve Grossman, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, Billy Cobham, and Herbie Hancock play on the atmospheric pieces. And to add to all this great music, possibly the coolest cover art of all time! &quot;Live-Evil&quot; is Miles at the top of his form, and is a masterpiece of electric jazz, and electric music too.&quot; is Miles at the top of his form, and is a masterpiece of electric jazz, and electric music too.

B00005B4GU|5.0|The new Radiohead album has come out less than a year after Kid A. At first I was skeptical, due to the fact that these were songs recorded at the same time as Kid A. The first thought that crossed my mind was: &quot;Same time? So are these throwaways?&quot; But, of course, I went out and bought &quot;Amnesiac.&quot; Kid A didn't catch on at first, as much as I'd like to say it did. I think that album worked much better as an idea than an album (I would still give it 5 stars, because it is a brilliant idea.). But, anyways, the first track &quot;Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box,&quot; confirmed my fears, it sounded like a cold machine.....but then came the glorious &quot;Pyramid Song.&quot; That song is the first song to give me goosebumps since &quot;Paranoid Android.&quot; And then my spirits lifted and I followed the rest of the album closer. The band uses more instruments and yes there are guitars. The standout tracks are &quot;Pyramid Song,&quot; &quot;You and Whose Army?,&quot; &quot;Knives Out,&quot; and &quot;Hunting Bears.&quot; They use jazz, they use rock, they use electronics, and it works. This album is incredible and blows away Kid A. Why they didn't release these songs first is beyond me....maybe to lower expectations.

While The Four Agreements presents rules or guidelines for living your life, the Kanes present a way of being in your life.  Their approach is based on the premise that through listening and simple, non judgmental awareness, you can lead a meaningful and enriching life instantaneously.  And it works!  Both of these books are great sources for creating your own heavenly life here on earth.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This  is my fist purchase of a Green Day Album, and I loved it so very, very much!  It has that ring and pop that set Green Day apart from the others.  They have dark songs, happy songs, in between songs, but there are no huge hits like basketcase!  If you liked the last three green day albums, this is a must buy!

B00005B4GU|3.0|....Being that it's essentially the second disc of the double album of which \\"Kid A\\" was the first disc, I have to immediately compare it to \\"Kid A\\" and say it's not nearly as good, definitely the weaker material recorded during the \\"Kid A\\" sessions, and we had to wait 8 months to find this out? All this aside..\\"Pyramid Song\\" is indeed one of their strongest tracks ever.As good a song as anything on \\"Kid A\\" or \\"OK Computer\\".\\"Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box\\" is a great companion piece to \\"Idioteque\\".\\"Amnesiac/Morning Bell\\" is fantastic and beautiful and serves as kind of a \\"Morning Bell\\" reprise.(If you're looking at this like a double album situation, which I am.)\\"Dollars & Cents\\" reminds me of \\"The Bends\\" (the whole album).\\"Like Spinning Plates\\" has some haunting vocal presence but the fact that they obviously just ran a track backwards is annoying, not novel.Any kid with a 4 track can reproduce that sound.I bought \\"Amnesiac\\" the day it came out and I will continue to purchase Radiohead's future material, it's just \\"Amnesiac\\" as a whole, isn't quite what I expected.They've certainly raised the bar high enough for a degree of \\"Let Down\\".
B000002513|5.0|Building on the promise of his debut effort, \\"Greetings From Asbury Park,\\" Bruce Springsteen unleashed the full force of both his talent and the E Street Band on \\"The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle\\" to produce one of the greatest albums of the '70's. The musical ground covered here is dizzying - Bruce as all-out rocker (\\"Rosalita\\"), folk troubador (\\"Wild Billy's Circus Story\\"), soul-master supreme (\\"The E Stree Shuffle,\\" \\"New York City Serenade\\"), master story teller (\\"Incident on 57th Street\\"), plaintive singer of love songs (\\"Sandy\\") and combination jazz jammer/\\"West Side Story\\" character (\\"Kitty's Back). In the hands of another artist, such an attempt at musical diversity could have been a disaster, but Springsteen's uncompromised musical integrity created a sometimes comical, somtimes tragic, but always authentic vison of New York/New Jersey that still sticks in the listener's soul some 25 years later.<br /><br />The spirited playing of the E Street Band i!s evident throughout - saxaphonist Clarence Clemmons (the Boss's favorite onstage foil) is everpresent, but also pay close attention to the work of keyboardists Danny Federrici and David Sancious (who left the band just prior to the \\"Born to Run\\" tour and was replaced by Roy Bittan). And while Bruce will never be confused with Eric Clapton, he delivers the goods time and time again on guitar.<br /><br />This was not the final evolution of the E Street Band - in addition to the keyboard switch, Max Weinburg replaced Vinny \\"Mad Dog\\" Lopez on drum, and Steve Van Zandt later joined the band for the \\"Born to Run\\" tour - but if there was ever any doubt as to the talent of the skinny kid from Jersey, this album put that to rest.
B000002KY8|4.0|1999 may have come and gone, but does that mean the album's a throw away? No! You've got the classic singles--&quot;1999&quot; (a &quot;personal&quot; number 1), &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; and &quot;Delerious&quot; and then there's &quot;Let's Pretend We're Married&quot;, &quot;Something in the water (Does not Compute)&quot; and &quot;International Lover&quot; that really makes this album special. It may be a little long and dated, but no one can go wrong here.
B00003CXP1|1.0|I'm a broad minded, artsy person.  I thoughr this film was the most offensive thing I've seen in years.  And it wasn't even interesting.  Which is kinda strange! It was &quot;boring - drugs - boring - offensive sex - boring - drugs, etc.&quot;  Yuch!  If you do watch it, check out a second tape to clean you out.  I picked Sense and Sensibility and it worked.
B000002KLP|3.0|I only gave this album 3 stars because I know he has better work out there. Although he has hits like &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; and &quot;Uptown&quot; no song really stands out to grab me. Then there is &quot;When You Were Mine&quot;, but even that song hasn't grabbed me yet. Overall, this is one of the few albums that works well being played as a whole, but other than that, nothing here excites me.
B000002N3J|4.0|The attention Madonna receives is almost exclusively directed toward her antics, with the music being largely ignored. With this collection of songs, she quietly diverts the attention from herself to the music. And, believe it or not, Madonna's music can stand proudly on its own.<br />&quot;Something to Remember&quot; collects ballads, almost all of which have been previously released, and none of which incorporate the controversial persona visible in much of her work, and fuses them together into a cohesive, low-key whole. Presented with little fanfare and spare liner notes, the listener is asked to take Madonna this time for her music, not the persona she has cultivated throughout her career.<br />Many of the songs in this collection are gems. My personal favorites are &quot;I'll Remember&quot;, &quot;Take a Bow&quot;, &quot;You'll See&quot;, &quot;This Used to Be My Playground&quot;, &quot;Live to Tell&quot;, &quot;One More Chance&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, and &quot;Oh Father&quot;. Above all, I love &quot;One More Chance&quot;, which is the only acoustic Madonna song I'm aware of. I hardly play the other songs; after awhile they begin to sound alike. But it was still worth the price of the CD to me.<br />Check out &quot;Something to Remember&quot; to see Madonna without the fanfare. It's really quite enjoyable.
B000002UZ1|5.0|I gave this cd five stars(4.5 actually) because contains some of the beatles most prolific songs. a good album for beginners.
B00005B4GU|2.0|I'm thinking aliens must have abducted Thom York right after OK Computer and did something, becasue this is not the same guy.  Message to aliens: Please return the old Thom!  I can't take it anymore.
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd was the best I've ever bought, if I was the seller I would raise the price to at least 19 dollars. Every song on this cd is good. Great guitarist, awesome DJing and lyrics, and the drummer is the best I've heard behind Red Hot Chili Peppers.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Sometimes their are those moods you get in where only one artist can effictively express your emotions for you.  Elliott Smith is one of those artists.  I wonder how I ever managed to be melancholy without him.<br />Though at times, Elliott needs to wash his mouth out with soap, I deal some of the needless f-bombs to hear the rest of his brilliant lyrics and soulful style.  The first seven songs on this album are absolutely brilliant.  By the time I get to 7, I want to hear 1 again, and rarely finish the album, but it has a powerful and poignant feel to it.  Repeated repetition of lyrics like &quot;everything means nothing to me,&quot; sung in a perfect octave, drill themselves into your brain with the depth of meaning a feeling Elliott seems to put into his work.  Son of Sam has some of the best guitar work around, and &quot;somebody that I used to know&quot; is a story every one has written at one time in their lives.  I suggest a listen.  Not just a listen, a buy, whether you've heard it or not.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|I have been waiting for this CD, painfully watching the release date pushed back and pushed back and pushed back. And now it's finally here. And, it's well worth the wait. The songs are a bit more peppy this time, more singable, like new Broadway showtunes for some private Rufus musical. Standouts are &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk,&quot; &quot;Greek Song&quot; and &quot;Grey Gardens.&quot; His voice sounds richer and clearer here, and his musical textures, with more instruments and other voices, makes this CD a pleasure to listen to. He seemed to have taken his time with this one and he's gotten it just right. After so much time since the last album, it's nice to keep the stereo repeating, and indulge yourself.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|From the second that the lights went out, I was pulled into this movie and it wouldn't let go. Moulin Rouge is a spectacular film. It's not only the best musical that I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies. The comedy in this film is just so fast and off the wall I found myself laughing because I just didn't know what the heck was going on! The musical arrangements of modern popular songs was pure genius and the dances were out of this world. Everything about this film was perfect, from the little conductor directing the 20th Century Fox theme to the grainy spotlight of the memorial at the very end. After the movie ended, it took a minute and a half for people to start moving; it's just that hard-hitting. I walked out of this movie wide-eyed and breathless; if you only see one movie this summer at least see this one, you won't regret your decision.
B000056K04|5.0|i don't care what any of you say, this album is about how love saves and it is forever beautiful because of that
B00005BJ2O|5.0|First of all, if you have yet to see this movie, stop reading and go. This was the most moving motion picture I have ever seen. From the art direction to the fabulous music to the magnet power behind the actors, I have never seen a more well rounded film. The music  fills my mind and visions of Satine and Christian come back to me as I hear the music. This movie makes me speechless and the soundtrack only adds to the feeling.
0553293397|4.0|The Naked Sun was definately worth reading as it contained some very intriguing and relevant ideas.  Unfortunately, the book was typically early-Asimov in that it lacked much action.  While this is important to some, this book didn't really need it to still be captivating.
B000002TQV|5.0|What can I say? This album by Radiohead is simply incredible. First time I listened to it I fell in love with it. In my opinion it is their best. So if you're a fan of the band, I'd recommend you to get The Bends. It is my favorite cd EVER!!
B000056K04|5.0|Once again, David J. Matthews, along with the help of guru Glen Ballard (Alanis Morissette) has produced an epic album.  It's new.  It's fresh.  It's different.  It's amazing.  With the introduction of the flashy and edgy electric guitar sound, Dave brings an exciting new flair to the driving, rhythmic music of his past endeavors.  Bam!  Right out front is the smash single 'I Did It' (Yes, you did, Dave!) capturing the listener immediately with raw, electric vibrance!  Throughout the remainder of the album we see a montage of great songs, new-sounding bass rhythms (simple -- nice) and vintage DMB with songs like 'Fool To Think' and 'Dreams of Our Fathers'.  Soulful Dave brings us 'Sleep to Dream Her', 'The Space Between', and 'Everyday'.  Yet another fabulous track, 'Angel' is akin to his smash hit 'Crash Into Me'.  What a fabulous album!  Yes, it's different, but it's called evolution, baby.  True fans will love it.  The skeptical may find it questionable.  Others will think it's a sell out.  I say, change is good.  He keeps the old fans, and recruits some new ones!
B00005AAFS|5.0|first i need to say, RAMMS+EIN IS THE BEST... rammstein makes great.. no really great music! there words sound so great and the way they talk is even better! but for me rammstein means more then just a band... see im from the netherlands and our relation with germany isnt very good since 1945... so i hated german on school... but when i heard BESTRAFE MICH on there previous album SEHNSUCHT... the world of german language opend for me... i did exam in german with a great mark... at first i couldnt speak german but i listend all rammstein's CDs all day long and my german kept on being better! now i know the lyrics to all there albums completely! and they still ROCK!!<br />so all buy this album... its great... there more then just a band... its a group of people on a mission!! RAMMS+EIN 4EVER
B0000027RL|5.0|This cd is by far pearl jam's best. Unlike &quot;vitalogy&quot; which has several unnecessarily long, drawn out and irritating tracks which only slow the pace of the album, &quot;ten&quot; is void of any worthless tracks.  However, the album's best songs have to be black, alive, jeremy and evenflow.  I have listened to this cd dozens of times and i'm still not tired of it.  If you fancy yourself a rock music fan, you have to buy this cd--fantastic!!
B000059ZLH|5.0|For fans who've followed Dream Theater for the past decade, this DVD is their greatest release, yet.  For those new to the group, this DVD represents the best possible introduction.  <br />There isn't much to complain about.  The sound is excellent, with nothing missing or overdone.  The performance is typical Dream Theater, flawless.  An absolutely accurate performance of the CD, with just enough elaboration to make it fresh.<br />My only regrets were that James' voice wasn't more up to par, with him having to drop down an octave on many occasions.  The DVD was produced by Mike Portnoy, and I assume that that accounts for the relatively small amount of time showing his drums.  Many times, you hear Portnoy do things and can't imagine how it's possible.  I would have liked to have seen him more.<br />Dream Theater has also done a great job of making use of the features availabe to DVD.  Don't get the VHS!  Even if you have to go buy or borrow a DVD-player, you'll miss WAY too much otherwise.<br />The 'commentary' feature of the DVD is phenomenal.  The group provides 2 hours + worth of insights into the music, what they're playing and why, how the story-line came about, and what they're thinking as they're playing certain sections.  In several places, you hear them react in surprise to what one of the band members does improvisationally.  Sometimes the feedback is positive, and sometimes it's negative!  Portnoy, at one point, starts getting on Derrick for messing up his rythm during a particularly difficult stretch.  Incredibly candid!<br />The bonus material might be the highlight of the DVD, with a 20 minute version of Change of Seasons!<br />I waited for months for this DVD to come out, and it far exceeded my expectations.  I've seen it several times, and will keep going back.  Metropolis 2000 is an incredible illustration of one of the most technically dynamic groups of this generation, playing live what would seem impossible in a studio!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I absolutely loved Moulin Rouge, I went to see it because I heard the music was modern, but wow...I was so amazed.  I am a music student, so I can appreciate the quality of the music and singing in the film.  I do not get emotional about movies, but I was shaking when Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sang together. I cannot wait to own the movie and I recommend the soundtrack.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Like jumping into a wonderworld. The usage of color and music brings viewer into the world of Moulin Rouge. The richness of this film is something that you can hardly find today. Compared to Pearl Harbor, I personally believe that Moulin Rouge is a better film. Especially, its music is so powerful and filled with emotions. The song, which I love most, is &quot;come what may.&quot; When its DVD comes out, it will be a must buy for me. Indeed, I am ready to enter the world of Moulin Rough again.
B00005B4GU|5.0|To tell you the truth I've been listening to Amnesiac for a good month now and I can trully say the music grows on you like a fungus.  More in the vein of Kid A than OKC and back, but this generally isn't a bad thing is it?  The album also isn't as flowing as Kid A or OK Computer, but more of a collection of good songs like The Bends.  To me this album may be Radioheads finest work.  They are into heavy experimenting but keep the same feel of Radiohead.<br />Pact Like Sardines in a Crushed Tin Box- 10/10,  This is a very dancy song that opens up with a kettle drum.  Pretty good lyrics a fairly deep singing for Thom.  A great opener.<br />Pyramid Song- 10/10,  Maybe Radiohead's finest work.  Some simple piano chords and really emotional singing, around 2:30 seconds into the song everything just fits together and leaves you in a beautiful trance.  The video is really good too.<br />Pulk/Pull- 8/10,  A kinda industrial esq. tune with heavy distorted bass.  Thom sings about different types of doors.  It is a little too similar through to much of the song but I think it's pure genious that they sampled some of Pyramid Song at the end of it.<br />You and Whose Army?- 7/10,  An oldschool Radiohead song.  I don't really like the lyrics much and Thom seems to be slacking with his singing.  But it still turns out pretty good.<br />I Might Be Wrong- 10/10,  The first catchy guitar riff from Jonny for a while and some great electronics and vocals round out the song.  Gotta love how it ends.<br />Knives Out- 10/10,  Another Bends era like song, should be the second single.  Apparently about cannablism.<br />Morningbell/Amnesiac- 7/10,  No where near as good as the Kid A version but seems more creepy.  Sounds like it came out of a childs nightmare.<br />Dollars and Cents- 10/10,  Good drumming and bass work.  Reminds me of old Radiohead too.<br />Hunting Bears- 10/10,  I love this little guitar peice, it makes a perfect transition from Dollars and Cents to.....<br />Like SpinningPlates- 10/10,  AMAZING, really experimentive using turntables and wierd singing.  <br />Life In A Glass House- 10/10,  I've heard it called New Orleans Funeral music and that does a pretty good job of labeling it.  I hope Radiohead does a jazz album because of this peice.<br />All in all it's just amazing.
0452282152|4.0|Tracy Chevalier, Girl with a Pearl Earring (Dutton, 1999)<br /><br />To date, I've read only one bad review of this slight novel, and a whole lot of excellent ones. I'm casting my vote on the excellent side. Chevalier took one of Vermeer's best-known and most enigmatic paintings and built a story around it (there are a series of these novels; Joyce Carol Oates' I Lock My Door Upon Myself is the only other one I've read, and it is similarly excellent). Griet, a sixteen-year-old from the Protestant side of the tracks, becomes the maidservant of the Vermeers after a kiln accident forces her father out of a job, and the story alternately skips between the variouis tensions within the Vermeer household and Griet's courting by a somewhat ham-handed, if well-meaning, butcher. It's subject matter that could have (and has) been screwed up in too many ways to imagine, but Chevalier pulls it off by keeping the prose spare and letting the silences speak most of the necessary lines. ****
B00005BJC7|5.0|There are bands that attempt to set standards for the music industry and fail because they try to maintain popularity amongst the drooling commercial world. Many musicians today forget what they are doing when they go into the studio.      <br />Radiohead has proven to me that there are still musicians out there who strive to put together albums that continue to challenge the mind and the way music is made.   Amnesiac left me in awe at the ability Radiohead has to continually open new doors for my musical senses to explore.    <br />I sincerely hope that whoever takes the time to read this review will also take the time to purchase, and listen to this cd, and try to understand that music means so much more to us than we can comprehend.     <br />I bought the limited edition cd, it reminds me of one of those childrens books you used to get at the library as a kid, no cover, just date stamps and pictures.  It is a red cloth bound small hardcover book.  The artwork inside the book is wonderful.  It gives insight into the messages provided in the songs through some artsy and thought provoking pictures.        <br />If you are a devout Radiohead diciple then go get the limited edition cd, however if you simply want a cd that brings a lot of diversity to your collection this disc will do the trick.  But either way, BUY THIS CD!
B000003S5H|4.0|an amazing and timeless cd about love and the the emotions behind you when you are in it.. it's the cd that although you dont rant and rave about to friends, you listen to it more than you care to admit, and when you do... your heart is listening.
B00005B4GU|5.0|The first question the typical alt. rock fan has when pondering over the new Radiohead release is, &quot;Is it simply Kid B?&quot; Yes and no. Radiohead, a band known for going in a totally different direction after each of their albums - from the hardguitar-laiden rock of Pablo Honey to the &quot;anti-pop&quot; guitars of The Bends to the Zeppelin-esque concept album of OK Computer to the eclectic Kid A - has done it again, sort of. Radiohead has used Kid A as a starting point to take off from, but hasn't leapt as far as the past. This is a fitting description - undescribable. Radiohead has moved even more eclectic then Kid A, and Yorke's vocals have gotten even more strained then before, if that's possible.<br />With some fans expecting a turn around to the early material, and others expecting a Kid A disk 2 (since much of the material was written during the same time as Kid A), and others expecting something tottally different, Radiohead has the strange ability to prove them all correct yet liars. Songs like I Might Be Wrong reek of Kid A, while others have recognizable guitar workings.  And then, songs like Life In A Glass House takes both concepts one step further. Give it to Radiohead, they always did throw us for a loop and defy explination.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead is undoubtedly the world's most smartest band and they, once again, project their genius on their fifth LP that was recorded the same time as Kid A. However, Kid A was a more intasteller, &quot;out there&quot;, kind of masterpiece. Not even a year later comes Amnesiac, a more &quot;earthly&quot; and song driven 11 track masterpiece from the band that introduces, once again, another kind of stage of music in a time and age that's basically going to hell with all the rap/metal and tenny bop bubble gum pop pestilence that's infesting the world rapidly. With Radiohead you don't know what to except because they're obviously not the conventional rock band that sells out. Their music is true and people should take notice in their originality and their creativity. In my opinion, I believe that Amnesiac is better than Kid A. I'm not saying that Kid A wasn't great because, by God, it was! It's just that Amnesiac feels like the album that so many people wished was next after OK Computer. But like OK and Kid A, you won't be dissapointed.
B000003NA3|5.0|John Coltrane was no stranger to controversy when he and his quintet arrived at New York's Village Vanguard in 1961; but the controversy that this extremely radical music aroused among jazz audiences, may have been a shock.  Critics, including those who a year or two earlier had championed Giant Steps and My Favorite Things, now derided the music as anti-jazz or worse.  Granted, this is some of Coltrane's most challenging pre-1965 music; but it is also music filled with incredible invention and joy, music that every open-minded jazz fan should check out.  There's &quot;Chasing the Trane&quot; from November 2, where Coltrane pretty much deconstructs the saxophone with honks, whoops, and screams but never quite forgets the joyful, singsong melody; the unforgettable duet between Coltrane and drummer Elvin Jones on the November 3 &quot;Impressions&quot;; and &quot;Softly as in a Morning Sunrise&quot;, which features the classic Coltrane quartet and is an interesting comparison to the version that Sonny Rollins recorded four years earlier at the same venue.  McCoy Tyner plays wonderful piano on &quot;Greensleeves&quot; and &quot;Softly...&quot;; Elvin Jones is, as usual, superhuman.  Eric Dolphy plays some of his finest music, with his vocal style on bass clarinet and alto sax -- from his anguish on both takes of &quot;Naima&quot; to the modal musings of &quot;India&quot;.  And yeah, several of the tracks are repeated, but each one is a universe to itself.  There's really no excuse for not owning this incredible box set, a milestone in jazz and 20th century music.
B00005BJC7|4.0|Radiohead's latest cd can be looked at as a remix of Kid A and a stripped down OK Computer.  I believe is much more than that and is a great cd. Radiohead refuses to be limited to labels of their own musical style....Radiohead continues to strive for what they consider to be musical perfection and it shows in every album they make.  True fans will love this cd for what it is, a no apologies, all out search and expression of the musical self.
B00003CXE7|4.0|I don't know about any of you but I really thought this was a good movie yeah some parts of the movie were slow but they all had something important in it which kind of summarized and put the movie together... Maybe those people who didnt enjoy this movie wasn't really into movies like this.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead, by far one of the best bands in the world, quite possible the universe, has once again outdone themselves on Amnesiac.  Kid A left me with a killer vibe but also wanting another fix of Radiohead.  Amnesiac picks up where Kid A left off and it feels like you never skipped a beat.  One of my personal favorites from Amnesiac is definitely Pyramid Song.  Do yourself a favor and get out your credit card right now to buy this disk.
0679879269|5.0|In a world where tyranny reigns supreme, where knowledge must succumb to ignorance, the destiny of the world, of many worlds, lays in the hearts of a girl and boy . . . .<br />  Have you ever dreamed of different worlds, other dimensions? Have you ever questioned the ideas and beliefs of humanity? Have YOU dared to be different? If so, this book is for you!<br />  I felt that this book was a wonderful conclusion to the series. When I first heard that it would be 518 pages, I still felt that it would be impossible for every &quot;loose-end&quot; to be &quot;tied up&quot;. With the complex cast of characters, including brave Lyra, steadfast Will, and the ruthless Mrs. Coulter, how could everything be completed in only one book? However, I was pleasantly surprised by the turn of events, especially the ending, by which every character's fate was made clear, and the mystery surrounding the fate of Lyra and Will revealed.<br />  I would like to conclude my review by saying that this book was marked by its cast of characters. Each one is so complex, marked by internal conflicts and struggles that mold them and the change is evident throughout the series. The character development, especially the growth of Lyra, was also impressive and enhanced the quality of the book. Sometimes, especially with Mrs. Coulter, a person isn't sure if they are good or bad!<br />  I won't say anymore, because this book is one surprise after another, and I don't want to ruin anything! Enjoy reading this fantasy novel, every one of the 518 pages is worth it!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I've longed for a time when actors and actresses would break into song on screen outside of musicals. I found this sound track to be quite artistic and highly enjoyable. It is so unique and wonderful. I'd strongly suggest it to anyone!
B00005B4GU|5.0|I just bought this today... obviously, seeing as how this is the release date... hmmm, I like it right off, maybe a bit more then Kid A actually, although it's gonna take some time to really figure out how, and what I like about it... first off, it's definately more rock oriented then Kid A, more guitars, and drumming (some songs sound similar to the Pablo Honey Radiohead sound), but it's also definately from the same recording sessions as Kid A... If you like Radioheads stuff, especially Kid A, you'll like this... this music really is excellent... they seem to have pushed forward more in the techno and electronic realms then Kid A, but yet they mesh that with traditional Radiohead rock and roll more then they did on Kid A... that alone is enough to make it a great album, but time will tell where I place this one with Radioheads previous GREAT releases... there are so many different sounds to a Radiohead album, and that's great... Here you have everything from Techno, electronica, to rock and roll, to jazz... yes yes, jazz... it's an amazing collection of music, and really does show the members of Radiohead as the geniouses that they are... Radiohead are probably the only band besides U2 that really excite me with they're music... I looked forward to the release of this album for months, and I am definately not dissappointed... if you like interesting music, check this out... keep up the good work guys...
B00005B4GU|4.0|This work by Radiohead captures a quenticentail Radiohead style with intense songs that are both quiet and stimulating (emotionally) such as 'Pyramid Song', a personal favorite.  A few of the songs are a little disappoiting and don't fit entirely into the flowo of the Cd, but for the most part this CD is definetely a new favorite of mine.
6300263673|5.0|For a PG-13 film, this has got to be the sexiest film I've seen.  This movie is a typical love story: girl and guy are different &quot;classes&quot;...girl and guy get together anyway...people object, etc. However, this film manages to get, and keep, your attention through several plot twists.        Jennifer Grey stars as &quot;Baby&quot; a spoiled daddy's girl.  Baby goes with her family to a resort for summer vacation.  There, she meets Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze), the defiant and seductive dance instructor.  Even though Baby is encouraged to learn &quot;lady-like&quot; dances and crafts, her heart's desire is to be a rebel for once in her life &amp; dance like the staff...dirty dancing.      When Johnny loses his dance partner, Baby takes over...even though she's never danced like that before.   It is obvious that Johnny is not pleased with the arrangement, but decides to endure the torture. During Baby's private dance lessons, the music is great and the chemistry between the two actors is absolutely sizzling!         This is very much a &quot;coming-of-age&quot; film. We get to see several characters grow up and learn life lessons quickly in this movie.  Although this movie appeals to a younger crowd, my best friend's mother is one of the biggest fans I know!!      I was somewhat disappointed with the ending, but overall, this is one of my favorite films of all times.  This is a must see &amp; a &quot;must buy&quot;...you'll want to see it again and again.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|Someone must have lost a load of fertilizer on the way to the garden store.  This is all the movie is good for.  Why does the &quot;Dwarf&quot; have a lisp ?  He was short not verbally challenged.  Save your money.
1891252089|5.0|after all of the ashtanga books and videos i have purchased and enjoyed, this book along with david swenson's videos are the best yet.<br />not only is the information organized in an easy-to-follow manner, but the design of the book itself is perfect....lays flat for me, etc.  and unlike some ashtanga teachers, david swenson  comes through as a real person with a consequent understanding of real life...the short forms are practical and useful for a person like myself who needs a bit of forgiveness for lack of time once in a while.  my whole family uses david's book and videos.
B00005B4GU|2.0|That Radiohead made a major change in artistic direction with &quot;Kid A&quot; is beyond debate.  However, the fact of the matter is that they're not all that great at what they're currently doing.  The album plods along, leading the listener to wish for songs to end quickly, in hopes that a good song will be next.  This is pretty much never the case.  Amnesiac has the musical feel of a postcard - a hollow, uninteresting photograph of some place that might be great, but we can't really judge.  By the end, one can't help but worry that Radiohead may be moving in the direction of bands with careers spanning decades, like Yes or Kansas, with each new album becoming more and more insignificant.  Most disappointing is when they took songs that once were good, or interesting (see: &quot;Life in a Glass House,&quot; compared to the minute-and-a-half segment form &quot;Meeting People is Easy,&quot; when they were still a band rather than some weird musical group), and tore them into mumbled boredom.  Radiohead seems more and more firmly pointed to the sad world of mediocrity.<br />For a while, Radiohead was on top of interesting and affecting new music.  As of now, however, they seem to take a back seat to the good music that is everywhere else, from Boards of Canada to godspeed you black emperor!, unable to find their own sound or definition and constantly treading water.
B00005B4GU|4.0|If your one of those Radiohead fans who liked their earlier albums (Pablo Honey, The Bends, OK Computer) as opposed to their last album (Kid A), this probably won't win you over.  Personally, I miss the stuff they did with their earlier albums, but liked &quot;Kid A&quot; nonetheless.  &quot;Amnesiac&quot; follows along the same path, but it's definitely refined.  There's more of a feeling of guys trying to make music as opposed to playing around with new toys.  It reminds me of 60's European spy flicks with dashes of stuff from &quot;Blade Runner&quot; thrown in.  There are one or two exceptions in the new album (&quot;Knives Out&quot; sounds like something from their &quot;OK Computer&quot; album, which is not a bad thing, mind you) and some more stunning orchestra work (&quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, &quot;Dollars &amp; Cents&quot;), but as opposed to &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is faster, more melodic, and in a weird way, more interesting than its predecessor.                                                   If you liked &quot;Kid A&quot;, this one's definitely worth a listen.
B000005QH3|5.0|They don't make movies like this anymore.   Vanishing Point isnot the typical spoon fed sugar coated crap that modern film has turned into.   Watch it and see.  It's not a preachy film either.  It's just damn good and one of my all time favorites.   <br />Don't get the idea this is a stupid car crashing movie.   It has some great cars and some do but it's not a special effects thing pretending to be a movie.<br />Barry Newman is great,   Mr Little is fantastic and the bit players are terrific.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Wow!  Just finishing my initial run-through to \\"Amnesiac\\", and it is AWESOME!!  I had heard the band was going towards a more guitar based approach, but it really only applies to a few more songs than usual, such as \\"Knives Out\\", and \\"Hunting Bears\\".   The effects and disjointed rhythms that made Kid A so surreal are still there, in spades on virtually every song.  This album is wonderful.  I never had any doubt though.  If you are a fan of good music that doesn't limit itself, and especially of Radiohead, BUY IT.  NOW!
B00003CXFG|1.0|I saw it in the theater and don't remember the plot I normally remember everything.  from the trailer I actually looked forward to seeing it.  It turned out to be very disapointing.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Man, do I love movies on DVD. How much do I love `em, you ask? Well, it's not just because of the extra features included in the Special Edition presentations. In the case of SUPERMAN The Movie, I decided to make a direct comparison between the DVD and the regular cut VHS edition. I got the disc, rented the tape, and then played both simultaneously on my TV, trying my best to keep them synchronous. I constantly switched back and forth between the VHS and DVD to see exactly which scenes were restored to the Special Edition. Yes, folks, this is my idea of a good time. Sad, isn't it?    But, thanks to my little side-by-side comparison, I was blown away by the amazing differences between the picture & sound qualities of the two formats of the first flick I ever saw in a theater. I was able to hear all of those subtle little background noises that are harder- if not impossible- to perceive on VHS. The tinkling of broken glass and the upheaval of Krypton's crust following the movies' opening credits is a wonderful example of the DVD's excellent sound variety & clarity. Of course, it also helps when the folks who released the DVD edition decided to enhance the sound as well!    Another great benefit of the superior audio is a better-sounding musical score. The opening titles theme is by far my all-time favorite piece of John Williams-composed movie music. No previous or subsequent Superman movie or TV show soundtrack score has even come close to capturing the essence of the character like Williams did for this movie. Ofttimes I'll watch the opening credits sequence several times in a row just so I can listen! There's even a music-only track where you can just kick back and play the DVD pretty much like it was a soundtrack CD!    The picture quality, aside from having a bit of a solarized glow during dissolves, was way sharper that its VHS counterpart. It was so sharp, in fact, I could see the matte borders around Kal-El's geode-cradle space ship-thingy as it flew through the psychedelic cosmos, as well as other limitations of the special effects of that era that were somewhat hidden in the muddier magnetic media. Hmm... perhaps having superior picture clarity isn't all it's cracked up to be, eh? Still, it's kinda cool to look back at the FX of the times and see how far things have advanced since then. Even director Richard Donner gets a bit nostalgic about the \\"good ol' days\\" of special effects on the commentary track. He also points out a few less-than-magic moments that he and co-commentator Tom Mankiewitz (sp?) get a bit of a laugh out of.    Then there are the new scenes, many of which passed by without me noticing much o a difference. It's likely due to the fact that I kinda remember them, since many of these bits were restored to the network TV broadcasts of the movie back in the 80s. One weird extra smidge of footage was the Kryptonian Council sending an enforcer to stop Jor-El from launching his sons' ship. Strangely enough, this little moment was never followed up; the enforcer was never seen again, save a brief appearance at the beginning of SUPERMAN II. Another cool addition is Superman running through Luthor's gauntlet of bullets, flames, and frost on his way to the criminal genius's lair (in the commentary track, Donner and Mankiewitz discussed the debate they had about whether or not they should have left the gauntlet scene in the theatrical release; they considered it too much of a \\"the-audience-already-knows-about-Supes'-invulnerability-so-why-repeat-ourselves?\\" thing, and ultimately dropped it). My favorite new moment, however, was an extension of the scene where young Clark Kent outruns the express train running through Smallville. This addition is one of those strange co-inky-dink-twist-of-fate-type moments that classic superhero books seem to have in spades. There's even a couple deleted scenes that weren't reincorporated into the movie involving Miss Teschmacher and Luthors' \\"babies\\". Fortunately, no footage wasshot that made references to Ned Beatty's (Otis) performance in 'Deliverance.' Speakin' of Otis: the interplay between Hackman and Beatty's characters added a great touch of lighthearted humor to counterbalance Luthor's scary scheme to... well, let's just say it involves Luthor's obsession with real estate.    Included in the bonus features section (aside from the stuff I've already brought up) is a three-part \\"making of\\" documentary hosted by Marc \\"Jimmy Olsen\\" McClure, a teaser trailer, and a couple screen tests featuring a laughably skinny Christopher Reeve in the Big Blue togs before he got himself beefed up for the flick (in the commentary track, Donner mentions that Reeve's personal trainer was David Prowse, better known as the guy inside the Darth Vader suit) . While I've been a bit jaded by DVD bonus features and extras lately, a few of them were almost as entertaining as the movie itself! The part where Richard Donner was confident that Reeve would walk again was kinda sad, however...    Before I wind this review up, I'll leave you with a totally useless and time-wasting activity for you to perform while watching this film. There's a not-so-magic moment where you can see director Richard Donner's reflection on a pane of glass! He also has an intentional cameo later on in the movie. His brief performance isn't exactly Hitchcockian or Tarantino-esque, but I think he makes out okay. Oh, and no fair listening to the commentary track (he points out both moments) while you're looking! Happy hunting!    `Late    UPDATE 7/20/2006: Ya might wanna hold off on buying this particular edition `til `round Thanksgiving 2006. I've a sneaking suspicion that Warner will be rereleasing this movie as well as all the other ones in super-mega-tricked-out special editions to coincide with the DVD release of \\"Superman Returns.\\" Hey, they did the same thing with the \\"Batman\\" movies when they put \\"Batman Begins\\" on DVD; I wouldn't put it past the Warner guys to do it with the Supesflicks, as well...    `Later
B00005B4GU|3.0|I have only listened to Amnesiac once in its entirety so my opinion may change about the album.  I can say without hesitation that I like Kid A more each time I listen to it so perhaps the same thing will occur with this album.  But I frankly feel a little let down by Amnesiac.  The buzz at the time of Kid A was that the next one was going to be the album with the hits.  Well, it does have You and Whose Army?, I Might be Wrong, and the Pyramid Song--all great songs where Radiohead sounds like a real band rather than a Warp wannabe.  Yet the songs I had most looked forward to--Knives Out and Dollars and Cents--are presented here in the studio form as pale cousins to the robust and excellent live versions.  Am I the only one who thinks that Radiohead sometimes sabotages or tinkers too much with some of its live staples before committing them to tape?  I certainly felt that way about Motion Picture Soundtrack with its kitchen-sink album version and even the magnificent How to Disappear Completely... which lost some of the desperate momentum of the live versions I have heard.  Amnesiac certainly does nothing to stop this trend.  Thank god Radiohead hasn't yet reached a satisfactory studio version of either Big Boots or True Love Waits; I'd rather hold the perfect live version in my head than have it pushed aside by an inferior studio version.  That Knives Out took 373 days to record frankly beggars belief (lost on the Westway, anyone?), particularly to end up with such a wan song.  But I'm being a little harsh.  This isn't a bad album by any means, though it may end up ranking only above Pablo Honey in the band's excellent discography.  All in all, Amnesiac is a fine follow-up to Kid A but not the album I had hoped for and even expected.
6305657939|2.0|This re-make was entirely unnecessary.  The original is available on VHS and DVD.  Steve McQueen and the glorious Faye Dunaway put these two pretenders to shame.  Miss Dunaway remains the sex symbol for the ages, even today.  Just imagine how hot she was in 1968 for the original.  Pass the re-make over and see the original today!
B000002J03|5.0|My 15 year-old daughter came up and asked me the other day, \\"Do we have Led Zeppelin II?\\" (yes, this is 2001) - \\"Uhh, well, no,\\" I said, feeling some vague guilt about never being quite the rocker I wish I'd been in the 60s and 70s.  But, God the relief after all the Mariah Carey, Destiny's Child and hiphop annoyances of the last few years of teen and pre-teen culture...<br />So I get the rare privilege of introducing my own little member of a new generation to the cool stuff we grew up with.  Not bad for ... bucks. Two please...
B00005B4GU|5.0|The answer: WHO CARES. The band that brought us easily one of the best albums of all time (OK Computer) decided to do a little more experimenting on this album in the same vein as that of Kid A. The funny thing is that a lot of people who were hoping for a &quot;rock&quot; album from Radiohead seem to forget that Amnesiac was recorded during the same time as Kid A. Yes, there are more &quot;songs&quot; here (although whoever views the stuff off Kid A as not actual songs simply because they have a lack of guitars is really rather ignorant and childish). Yes, at points, there is certainly that Bends-era Radiohead seeping through the crack (like on the straight-forward Knives Out, which is ironically one of the weakest songs on the album). But for the most part, Radiohead tries to mix the structure of its old style with the experimentation of their new, and with almost 100% success. The only problem they come up against is Amenesiac doesn't sound entirely cohesive at points. But if you can get past that slight technicality, you'll quickly appreciate the new album by the most artistically challenging band in the mainstream today. It's called Amnesiac because it will make you forget that the &quot;old&quot; Radiohead ever existed. The king is dead. Long live the king.
B00003W8NM|5.0|The answer is:  It's too good of a movie.  It makes you feel like you should have known what was up, but you never had a clue until the end.  There is so many hints you almost feel stupid for not catching them.  It is better understood the second time around.  And even more so the third.  Just give this movie a chance.  And if you are human, it WILL disturb you.
B00005BL2A|4.0|First off, I'd like to say that many of the reviews I've read so far seem too hasty concerning this album. &quot;Exciter&quot; is DM's deepest album to date and Martin Gore's songwriting is as awesome as it always has been. This album doesn't grab you right from the start, but if you listen to it a while, you will eventually come around. I think quite a few of these people were hoping for another &quot;Violator&quot;, but come on everybody; a band has to progress in order to stay fresh. If you give it a chance, you'll be able to experience some truly beautiful music...
B00005B4GU|5.0|After a mere eight monthes, Amnesiac is finally released.  It's easy to compare the album to Kid A in that the two albums were recorded in the same session.  The main difference, however, between these two unbelievable albums is that Amnesiac is a whole lot more varied than Kid A.  Kid A seemed to focus a lot more an electronica and subtle beats.  That electronica is still present on Amnesiac, yet their are hints of jazz and (yes!) their old roots of rock.<br />&quot;Packt Like Sardines in a Crushed Tin Box&quot; opens the album with a beat that seems to be the calmer sibling of Idioteque.  Yorke repeats &quot;I'm a resonable man, get off my case&quot; while idiosyncratic noises buzz throughout the song.  One of my favorite noises is the maddening circus one.<br />&quot;Pyramid Song&quot; is a piano number filled with melancholy.  It slowly crescendos into drums while Yorke pours his heart out.<br />&quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; is probably one of the most radical things Radiohead has ever done.  In the same spirit of the title track of Kid A, in this song Yorke's voice is completely unintelligible.  <br />&quot;You and Whose Army&quot; recalls the days of OK Computer.  This time however, jazz is incorporated, and the results are beautiful as well as miserable.<br />&quot;I Might be Wrong&quot; is another step forward for Radiohead, with a delta-bluesish guitar playing in the background.  The guitar is complemented with Yorke's blurred vocals.  Fantastic track.<br />&quot;Knives Out&quot; is unbelievable.  This one proves Radiohead has not completely shunned their instruments.  The minor chord changes again bring back the days of OK Computer.  One of my favorites.<br />If one track could be considered a little negligible on the album, its the &quot;Morning Bell/ Amnesiac&quot; track.  Though the song is good, it pales in comparison to the Kid A &quot;Morning Bell&quot;.  Plus, I wish a new track replaced it, but this is Radiohead's vision, so I can't reallytamper with it.<br />&quot;Dollars and Cents&quot; is another bass-geared track, with echoing drums and a majestic string arrangement.  Yorke's repeating of the line &quot;Why don't you quiet down...&quot; really strikes a chord in the listener.<br />&quot;Hunting Bears&quot; has a somewhat Sgt. Pepperrs kind of guitar that just improvises for basically two minutes.  Just like &quot;Treefingers&quot; was an ambient instrumental, &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; is a bluesy, rocking one.<br />&quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; is exactly what its name implies.  Yorke rambles the title with a swirling backwards-looping track.<br />&quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot; is another bold new move for the band.  More jazz is explored here, with a full guest jazz group on the track.  Its very loose, very improvised, but that's what creates such a wonderful effect.  Its a very solid closing number.<br />Amnesiac is an album that certainly grows on you.  Why I think its better than Kid A is that explores a lot of new musical styles and genres.  It's a fantastic album, and even though it was created in the same sessions as Kid A, somehow its another bold move for Radiohead.
B00000DQSS|5.0|This was the album that introduced me to Kate in the early eighties. After listening to it I went out the next day and bought The Kick Inside and Lionheart. Twenty years later this album is still one of my favorites. Never for Ever is simply one of those rare pieces of art which can transport the receptive listener from his sitting room  through a bewildering array of emotions and situations. Such disparate scenes as the great Delius and Fenby working together, a bride shooting her husband, and a post apocalyptic plutonium suffocation don't seem to have much in common but it all comes together in in a magical way.
B00004Z400|4.0|A very nice rock cd.It is kinda weird how some song are really hardcore while others are slow and strange.But it still kicks major @$$.
B00003CX5P|5.0|i just read that the dvd edition of this movie is sceduled to be released october 16,2001 in a 2 disc special edition....and the rest of the films are to be done in a 2 disc editon also and released one per year until they are all out....i don't know how firm this announcement is,but i hope that it's true!
B00005IC2H|5.0|I am American and don't have the slightest idea what the lead singer of Sigur Ros is saying but it is the most beuatiful music I have ever heard.  This album transcends any language barrier you might have.  Don't worry about the fact that it's Icelandic.  Just let the music itself carry you away.  You will not be disappointed.  This entire album is awesome and inspiring.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Actually, even though I am a big Radiohead fan (and a fan of stranger, more experimental music too) I wasn't freaked out by Kid A.  Yes, the sounds were interesting enough, but nothing really grabbed me.  Not so for Amnesiac.  This album has all the interesting sonic qualities of Kid A, but also has some great melodic hooks.  Thom Yorke's vocals are as haunting as ever.  &quot;You and Who's Army&quot; and &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; have the ability to send shivers up the spine.  I like the way the band maintains and edge of experimental texture while incorporating more traditional instrumental elements into their music.  Admittedly, I'm just listening to this for the first time now and haven't had the time to digest it all (hence the four stars--that could go up to five or down to three, but more likely up), but I'm comparing it to my initial response to Kid A, and this is much more favourable.  If you liked Kid A, I'm sure you will like this...if you didn't like Kid A, you will probably still like this!
B00004RHZU|4.0|It took me this long to buy this cd because of the first single, There You Go.  It sounded like angry woman music, which I don't like.  Then came Most Girls (check!), You Make Me Sick (double check), and I was sold.  I love Hell Wit Ya.  I've been listening to it over and over again.  Split Personality is good too.  Love Is Such A Crazy Thing is another one of my favorites.  But when the title track Can't Take Me Home comes on, I have to press skip.  Not for my ears.  It's such a shame, because otherwise the album is really good, and very unique too.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Don't get me wrong.  I love Kid A -- I think it was by far the best album released last year.  However, Radiohead have topped themselves again with Amnesiac, which just happens to have been recorded at the same time as Kid A.  Amnesiac merges the experimental style of Kid A with the great songwriting of earlier Radiohead efforts.  A greater (compared to Kid A) emphasis on Thom Yorke's vocals also elevates this work to higher emotional levels than Kid A achieved.<br />This album deserves a song-by-song review, so here goes...<br />1.  Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box - 4.5/5 - A great opener that provides transisition from Kid A to Amnesiac.  Really sets the tone for the album.<br />2.  Pyramid Song - 5/5 - wow...  I feel like I went to heaven in a little rowboat.<br />3.  Pulk/pull Revolving Doors - 3.5/5 - A pretty cool song, but not quite up to the standards of the rest of the album.  It does have a great beat to it though.<br />4.  You and Whose Army? - 4.5/5 - Another great one that shows off Radiohead's unique songwriting talents.<br />5.  I Might Be Wrong - 4/5 - Solid guitar-driven song.  The highlights of this track are Thom's vocals and Colin's bass line.<br />6.  Knives Out - 4/5 - Another guitar-centric number.  Could be the next single... I'd bet.  Not really radio material, but that's a good thing.<br />7.  Morning Bell/Amnesiac - 4/5 - Really cool reworking of Morning Bell.  Sounds like an acid trip.  This reminds me of the Beatles' Revolution, with the different versions of the same song.<br />8.  Dollars &amp; Cents - 4.5/5 - Didn't like this song as much as first, but it really grew on me, now it's one of my favorites.  &quot;Why don't you quiet down?&quot;<br />9.  Hunting Bears - 3.5/5 - Fits with the album as a whole, but this little instrumental interlude doesn't really stand up on it's own.<br />10.  Like Spinning Plates - 5/5 - Incredible!  I love Thom's vocal effect in the verse...  he learned to sing the verse backwards, then they reversed his backwards recording back to forwards.  It's hard to understand, but sounds really good.<br />11.  Life in a Glass House - 5/5 - Radiohead can write a song in any style of music and still make it work.  This is a departure, even for them, but it adds up to one of their best songs ever.<br />Although I gave some songs 3.5/5 it's important to remember that these songs work 20x better in context.  That's why I rated the whole album a 5/5.  Amnesiac is an another amazing record from these paranoid androids, that only deepens with every spin.
6303379214|5.0|Marisa Tomei is so funny.  In this movie she goes running after her supposed soulmate and finds something else instead.  Robert Downey Jr. is always amazing, but I don't think these two had the greatest chemistry.  That doesn't take away from the story, though.  There's another side story going on with Bonnie Hunt, who plays Marisa's sister, and her husband, played by Fisher Stevens.  It all ends on a happy note, ofcourse, but the journey is enjoyable.
6305807086|5.0|...holds it's own at home. A truly original film.
0553106635|5.0|When I started on A game of Thrones, it was pretty clear who were the good guys and the bad guys (The Starks and Lannisters, respectively). In the second book, the diversion becomes a bit more foggy, and, having read A Storm of Swords, why, I do not even know who's against who anymore! I speculate that Martin will b introducing some 'Dark Lord' anytime soon, but regarding the humans, I can even understand Jaime Lannister's choice to slay the king he was sworn to protect with his own life. Who is Stark to think he can judge Jaime?  Anyway, A song of Ice and Fire is the best series I've ever read (and I have read plenty, including Herbert and Tolkien) and I currently know of no book that is even close to the kind of complexity Martin adds to his characters. The only criticism I have to offer is that he could cut back some on the sex, for my taste.
B00003CXP1|5.0|What is brilliant about this film is that instead of merely killing the characters or making them all better (I've seen enough of that in drug films), Requiem makes them live with what they've done, which is much more disturbing and frightening than anyone dying.  When I first saw this film I was speechless for weeks.  The visuals are amazing, the performances are incredible, and the direction is brilliant.  This is not just a movie, it is something impossible to describe in less than a million words.  It does not preach, but it will put you in the position where doing drugs is not only not an option, but it is something that will make you want to go on TV and preach to America &quot;See Requiem for a Dream&quot;.  This film will save lives.
0060975768|5.0|If ever you wanted to feel what it must have like to be in Vietnam during that awful war. READ this book. It is so realistic that you could hear the bullets zing by your face. After reading this book, my esteem and respect, now has no bounds for the combat vets of that conflict. Let us hope that our collective memory for the fallen never fades away. They deserve to honoured and revered, just like our respect for the World War 2 &amp; Korean vets.
B00005B36H|4.0|Listening to Lateralus for the first few times, its hard not to wanna make comparisons to Anemia.  But this album deserves to be viewed as separate, individual artistic work; it's not a follow-up.  That's not to say that this album is light years beyond what Tool fans are familer with.  There's plenty here for long-time fans to enjoy.  But if you're looking for another Undertow or Anemia, get ready to be disappointed. The band has evolved quite well over the last few years during their leave of abscense.  The textures and moods on the album are much more dynamic.  Songs like Disposition and Parobola show the great range Tool has developed in thier songs.  Lateralus seems to incorporate more psychedelic and quieter sounds on its multilayered songs.  But the metal aspect of the band is not overlooked; the pumuling, thundering &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; sees to that.   The bands approach to song structure has also developed incredibly.  The songs on Lateralus twist and turn through numerous changes in tempo and intensity creating an exciting dramatic effect. Tools performance as band has never sounded so great.   There's loads of hammering, chunks of guitar layered over pounding, trible beats.  Justin Chancellor's bass especially deserves atteniton for his amazing inovation.  And of course, the beloved Maynard unleashes his best vocals yet with his most emotional, thought-provoking lyrics. As a whole, Lateralus doesn't holp up perfecly.  It may not totally justify the 78 min of listening, although there really isn't a boring moment on this thrill ride of an album.  It's complexity and depth do take some getting used to.  The bottom line however, is that Tool are the most talented, artics rock band of the last decade and this album proves that.

B00005B4GU|4.0|Its almost impossible to believe that the same band that released Kid A less than a year ago has now released Amnesiac.  The songs are a world apart, dense, and even more mature than the work on Kid A.  What is even more amazing is that both of these albums (so different and focused individually) were recorded at the same time.<br />Amnesiac has a relatively electronica feel to it, no as much as Kid A.  The backbeats are pushed further back into the mix allowing Thom's voice to once again take over the reigns.  But, this isn't the Bends, its not OK Computer and its isnt as much of a leap from OK to Kid A.  Amnesiac seems to be picking up somewhere around where Kid A left off and taking us on a completely different trip altogether.  <br />Pyramid Song and You and Whose Army have vaguely classical sounds and arrangements with Thom vocals up front and center while the fragile music sways the song along.  <br />No traditional full on rockers on this album and as Kid A, not an overwhelming amount of single (radio friendly) material.  Amnesiac, like Kid A, is meant to be listened to as a album, a piece of art, with a distinct message.  It will be interesting to see how they mix both the Amnesiac material with Kid A and their back catalogue in a live setting.<br />Amnesiac solidifies Radiohead's position as the most daring, original and vital band in rock.

0684853523|2.0|This book by Stephen King is part autobiography (good) and part writing masterclass (bad).  If he had written his autobiography in more detail we would have had an engrossing read.  As it is, King glosses over the horrors of alcoholism and hit and runs, giving us the very barest of bones about issues and incidents that shaped his interesting life.  He seems in a rush to get to the &quot;masterclass&quot; section of the book which is a great pity, as the bits of his life we do hear about are written in such a way that only King can.  Even when only briefly touching upon some incidents, he still manages to illicit revulsion and disgust from the smallest detail.  What did come across as really interesting, however, were the accounts of his early writing and the way in which he got his big break.  I felt there was far more information for the budding writer in these early parts than in the second half of the book, which was actually &quot;On Writing&quot;<br />King makes an attempt to explain to any budding writer what to write, what not to write and when to do it.  His advice on adverbs and tenses and how to plot (or not) in his case came across as unhelpful.  I accept that Stephen King may have told us what worked for him, but I do not believe many people can simply begin with an incident to write an entire book without plotting.  I feel that if he had to write a masterclass on the writing craft, he should have made it more textbook like and less personal.  I do not feel that too many people (of which surely all of them will never be as a good a writer as King himself) will have gained much help from this book.<br />It is my thought there there was two books to be written here and the autobiography in particular should have been a really good read.  As it is, King has rushed out a book that comes across as ill thought out and clumsy.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is amazing. The production is flawless,and the album is a great mix of rock and rap. I also think it is fantastic that they don't feel the need to swear on the album.
B00003CXN4|5.0|The cast was unbelievable, the story was very well-directed, and the different color-filming techniques were great.  I was very interested in this movie solely for the purpose of seeing the newly-wed Douglas and Zeta-Jones together, but surprisingly this had tons of superb actors including Dennis Quaid, Salma Hayek, and Miguel Ferrer.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed almost every minute of this movie.  It almost played like three documentaries on drugs, all woven together to create a stunning movie.  It was very moving to see how drugs effect everyone, to the naive drug-lord's wife, to the teens I see at school everyday.<br />I particularly do not care for Douglas, but I though he did a powerful job as a (typical) naive parent when it comes to their kids and drugs.  Zeta Jones was great too; it was shocking to see how powerful the effect the corruption of drugs had on her.  To see someone like her character lose everything to drugs, and then come crawling back to them as her way out was breath-taking.<br />Very good thought-provoking movie, by its end, you will have formed your opinion on drugs though; so be prepared.
0783225881|5.0|Field of Dreams is an epic movie. Ray Kinsella a farmer in the mid west. The movie is based on the plot of Ray hearing voices that convince him to build a baseball field on his farm. It goes though Rays journey of what the voices are telling him to do with his baseball field the reason for this journey is why you must watch this movie. This is an excellent movie because it deals with a mans struggle to find himself in life also dealing with his relationship with his father and, his family life. This is a very heart touching movie and do not think you have to love baseball just to watch this movie though it does help. It is a funny but yet a very heart warming movie for the whole family. I would give a five star a must buy.
0395759242|4.0|Any reader will be able to tell what horrified me.  What fascinated me was the description of Leopold II's cunning manipulation of his own image. He bamboozled diplomats, most journalists, and the public in Europe and the U.S.  His downfall (not that he really had much of one) or rather the downfall of his reputation came from a few journalists some Protestant missionaries.  Hochschild bluntly points out that the Belgians in WW I managed to generate stories of German atrocities commited against them that largely never happened but were precisely what they had inflicted on the Congolese.  Do I have a complaint?  Yes , I would like more photographs (and the ones in the poorl bound edition I have are falling out).
0385335482|5.0|This book was amazing and outrageously funny from beginning to end.  I look forward to another one by Sophie Kinsella.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|These three masterpieces should be on DVD, but I heard a rumor that Lucas did not want them released on DVD till all 6 episodes were out on video. That way, all 6 would be released as a box set with an enormous price tag. Just a rumor though, so take it with a grain of salt. Anyhow, these movies deserve nothing less than 5 stars. They're clear classics that will forever be adored by many fans.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Yes, it was hard to say about Kid A after first listens that it is enjoyable, then about Amnesiac it can be said even more. However, tracks are more accesable, lyrics are more lyrics, not more just writen to put voice in tracks as is sounded in Kid A. What can we say about this brother of Kid A? Why I'm happy about Amnesiac? Because seems Radiohead started to think about double LP but then idea was dropped (fortunately)... It has so different tracks that it can't be described as one genre or if it comes from one planet... 'Packed like sardins' is really good opener, sounds something like 'Dancer In The Dark' soundtrack, really good song, have strong message about messy man which life is just crap. 'Pyramid Song' - One of most beatiful songs written about afterlife, very close to classics. Sounds like they recorded pure classic. 'I'm might be wrong' - at start it sounded like most dull song in Radiohead history, but actually it's really really something new for them. 'Living In Glass House' - jazzy and ironical song, nothing more to say, thanks for god, more than song than experiment. And.... In fact, like most of records from Radiohead, you can make your own decision it's worth to listen or not to listen only...when you listen.  And keep listen them...They never disappoints those who really wants listen.
031286504X|4.0|I was really enjoying I Am Legend when it suddenly ended just partway through the book.  What I didn't realize, was that this classic vampire yarn is only a novella, and that the rest of this paperback is filled with other short horror stories by the author.  Whereas I Am Legend is still a good read, generally standing the test of time, the other stories are almost comically outdated.  In an era of greatly sophisticated horror films and novels, these short stories of yesterday seem almost like a caricature of themselves, though they must have been scary enough when they were first published. If you're interested in an absorbing vampire tale, definitely pick up a copy of I Am Legend.  Just don't expect it to last for an entire flight across the Atlantic.
B000009QPE|5.0|Funny, im a big slayer and 80s thrash fan, but never liked the death metal scene it  directly spawned.Sepultura,fear factory and a few others ,aybe, but not much PURe death.For a start the death vocals always sounded...lame to me.Arraya screamed and growled, but always emphasised his lyrics literally. Even at their fastest,the vocals were no blur, they were almost incantation like, the words  thus gaining import. As for Satan,i have no interest.Serious evil sucks,but i think the shock value of  pioneers like slayer has to be put in context.      when they did it it was jaw dropping in controversy.Every band since dealing with such  lyrics has done so with gradually  diminishing effect.Like every punk band since the pistols has had to heve somethjin  other than shock snot value to be of note.        Same with the speed.Slayer made  eyes open with their velocity. Hardcore had in spades, but slayers  was of a different,technical bent.Everty metal band basing itself on speed since has, again, done so consciously trying to  go 'one better'.As such, there is something more organic about these 80s pioneers.They never followed such a simple plan,they made totally NEW music.      The main thing,however,is not the speed,the  heaviness or the controversy,its the songs. Pick one of the zillions of idenikit satan and death bands of the last 10 years.Name a song of theirs that will sit side by  side in the history books with the almost boringly famous angel of death or raining blood.        I also love slayer,anthrax,mettalica etc cos they represent the birth of the punk/metal fusion.All the big thrash innovators covered and coveted great punk,eg misfits,pistols, mior threat etc.Hard to think the two camps once disliked each other,Were all brothers kids. Even todays punks like the awesome Less than jake  cover slayer now in return.       This album is a historical land mark  in music, but is still an enjoyable  work of art in its own right. Not like computer technology,where a Pentium processor is historically significant but outmoded or even obsolete in a couple of years.  See you in the pit,friends
B00005B4GU|5.0|Ed O'Brien has remarked of `Amnesiac' that it is akin to picking up a telephone and hearing a human voice, as opposed to the answering machine that was `Kid A'. Upon first listen however, `Amnesiac' seems as frustrating, perplexing and underdeveloped as `Kid A' did when we first heard it. But time has allowed us to realise how strong an album that was, and `Amnesiac' reveals itself to be what is possibly Radiohead's finest album after the multitude of listens your obsessive fan will inevitably give it.  One rumour that has been wrongly perpreatrated is that `Amnesiac' somehow marks a return to the Radiohead of old, but this is not really the case. True, guitars, lyrics and melody figure much more heavily in this album than `Kid A', but the album also extends itself even further from convention on tracks such as `Like Spinning Plates'.<br />The album opener is `Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box', which, typically obtuse title aside, is one of the more melodic songs Radiohead have given us recently. The clanging kettle drum sample that opens that song is reminiscent of `Idioteque', but once the retro drum machine and mellotron line comes in, the song becomes almost like a pop song, with (shock!) a chorus. The song is eventually buried in a melee of samples, and gives way to the icy hush of `Pyramid Song'. Those who have followed Radiohead closely over the last year will be familiar with this stilted and oddly beautiful piano ballad. Here it is given the backing of alien noises and a gorgeous, lush string arrangement, that combined with Phil's broken drum line is reminiscent of `Spirit of Eden' era Talk Talk given an apocalyptic intensity. Aphex style beatery returns in the form of `Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors', which  has Thom rambling on the topic of doors in a helium voice over clattering, screechy, industrial beats and a massive bass. `You and Whose Army' starts off as a feeble strum, with a resigned and compressed Yorke vocal taunting authority. At two minutesthe song explodes into a gospelly denouement with bluesy piano, double bass and full on drums bringing the song to a crunching climax. `I might be wrong' is another much played live song, although here its dirty riff is accompanied with stuttering, mechanical beats and lots of weird noises. The lyrics praise promiscuity and carefree abandon, but the music is so sinister that it all seems rather contradictory. Hopefully, this superb track will be relased as a single to show that Radiohead can do insiduously catachy pop as well as anyone else. `Knives Out' is one of the bleakest tracks on the album, with it's resolute minor key and lyrics about cannibalism. It is also the most straightforward and melodic song Radiohead have released since `The Bends' and makes use of all 3 (and sometimes 4 ) guitars. The Rickenbackers give it that authentic 60's feel, although here it all sounds like a bad trip, particularly with the mounting dissonant guitars at the end. `Morning Bell' is indeed the same song as in `Kid A', but here the 5/4 drums and Rhodes piano have been subsumed with dense layers of sound. This shorter, shuffly, more organic version brings out the more amnesia tinged themes of the song, and as such fits the song well on the album. `Dollars and Cents' is this album's `National Anthem' with the same mix of an insistent bassline (here much lighter and funkier in feel) and instrumental arrangement, with stabbing `Psycho' strings mimicking Thom's high, swooning vocal. Like `You and Whose Army', the subject matter is decidely political, and fits with the anti-capitalist image the band has seemingly adopted recently. The track is also notable for containing the best Phil Selway drumming ever, as he keeps up the cymbally, powerfully propulsive drum arrangement with drive. `Hunting Bears' is one of my favourite tracks on the album. An instrumental, it has been compared to `Treefingers' from Kid A, but where that was self indulgent and overlong, `Hunting Bears' is quietlymoving. `Like Spinning Plates' is by far the most avant garde thing that Radiohead have ever released, and is also one of the most beautiful. It begins with what sounds like the scratching of turntables at lighting quick speed which continues throughout he whole song. The rhythm is provided by backwards, bassy keyboard sounds and is very catchy. After some random tapping of cymbals, Yorke's mystical, backwards vocals come in and then surprisingly sound the correct way round. Accompanied by a beautiful synth wash, he sings `This just feels like spinning plates' in a haunting falsetto, the effect being of total isolation and confusion. Radiohead leave their most shocking coup til last. `Life In A Glass House' is the much vaunted duet with veteran trumpeter Humphrey Lyttleton, and his presence on the track is immense. Like `Motion Picture Soundtrack' on `Kid A', this is an old acoustic ballad that has been radically overhaulled for the newly experimental sound of the band. It has that perfect end of album feel, with lazy vocals and drunken horns sloshing all over the track before powerfully pulling together in an emotionally charged `goodbye'. It is one of the most unique tracks on the album, and shows perfectly how much Radiohead have changed as to make this formerly conservative ballad almost unrecognisable and joyous.<br />`Amnesiac' is incomparable to Radiohead's other works, because, unlike `Kid A' or `OK Computer' it does not fit together as one whole 45 minute piece of music. Rather, these tracks can be enjoyed on their own in any order, and the album does have a much lighter tone than `Kid A'. They have learnt that they don't have to sacrifice level headedness and amazing songwriting for experimentalism to suceed. After a few listens, `Amnesiac' will stand out to anyone as Radiohead's most diverse and exciting album. Don't be surprised if it ends up the biggest.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump is one of the best film of all time. Definitely the best Zemeckis's work so far and he has put so much soul and depth to this 1994 Academy Award winning Best Picture. This movie portrays the life of a slow-witted character who gets embroiled in various ridiculous situations. He was a Vietnam war hero, received a congressional medal of honour, shook hands with many US Presidents and was a successful owner of a shrimp company. We get to see many world events through the eyes of a supposedly &quot;dumb&quot; character. The flow and pace of the movie was perfect as we ride through various historical events like the Vietnam War, assasination of JFK and the Watergate Scandal.    Tom Hanks gave an undeniably wonderful performance as Forrest and truly deserves the Oscar that he earned. Gary Sinise gave a superb performance as Lieutenant Dan in the movie. Even though he was only nominated and did not win anything, I felt he really deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The scene where he pulled Forrest down from the bed and cursed him for saving his life, just simply blew me away. Sally Field is also wonderful as Forrest's mother and deserves the Oscar as well. The line &quot;Forrest, you have to do your best what God has given you. Be brave Forrest, be brave in everything you do. Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you gonna get.&quot; really moved me and brought me tears. No movie had bring such emotion in me. Robin Wright did her role well as Forrest's love interest and complements well to Forrest's life. The actors truly brings the characters to life and I must salute Zemeckis for choosing the perfect cast.    The technical aspect of the film is just excellent. The visual effects is unlike anything we have seen before. Many movies have not fully utilised the CGI effects to complement it. Nowadays, filmmakers just want to show what special effects they can do rather than what the special effects can do for the film. In Forrest Gump, visual effects are utilised to their best to create unbelievable scenes. Scenes like the flying feather, Lieutenant Dans' missing legs, Vietnam War, meeting of the president is just incredible. This is what visual effects is all about. To create impossible scenes to the big screen.   Alan Silvestri's film score is one of the best scores I have ever heard. From the touching piano piece at the beginning feather scene to the uplifting tune of Forrest hugging Jenny at the Washington square scene, Alan's award-winning score truly brings the perfect mood and emotion to the film.   Every aspect of this movie is simply excellent from the eye-popping special effects, film editing, wonderful score, sound, to the theme of the movie. This movie makes us realised that we all have a purpose in life and that we all have the ability to do the impossible. Forrest Gump tells us that we all should have strong principles and beliefs to succeed in life. Forrest only believes in 3 person. He believes in God, his momma and Jenny. Nothing can go past them.  Just look at what Forrest has achieved. He is the President of a shrimp company, a war hero, a Ping-Pong champion, and a happy father. Forrest Gump simply tells us that we can achieve anything in life as long as we put our best effort and believe in everything that we do.    Forrest Gump is no doubt one the best films I have ever seen. It changes my perception of life and makes me realised that we all have a purpose in this world. We probably won't be seeing anything like this forever. A true masterpiece.
B00000IPAX|1.0|Tell me, how in the world we went from great punk bands like The Dead Kennedys, Misfits(not newfits), Cramps, Black Flag, and such, to Blink 182?  Punk used to mean something, it was the thought of noncomformity, of rebellion, and to Anarchy. Now we got a couple of poser punkers who go out and play some of the worst punk songs in the world. Now mind you, that this is only on the recent albums. They're older stuff was more true to punk then &quot;All the Small things&quot;  Yet another group killed by the MTV genre. Speaking of which.. you ever notice that the heaviest of bands hardly get played on MTV?
B000056K04|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of the Dave Matthews Band.  Their music is extremely unique, and never fails to impress me every time I listen to it, even if it is for the hundredth time.  In their new CD, Everyday, they again make magic.  I must admit, though, that it is a little different from their older stuff - possibly having a slight &quot;pop&quot; twist to it.  But never-the-less, it is still amazing music.  I recommend it to everyone.  From rock to jazz to hip-hop to pop, everyone should give it a chance.  You won't be sorry.
0684833395|5.0|Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is a modern masterpiece, an intricate, deliberate, perfect combination of wry sarcasm, raw wit, and bitter cynicism scattered amongst the lives of desperate men trying to live up to their ideals from within the greatest conflict of the modern age. Heller's text of Catch-22 is a recipe for delicious humor and refreshing insight that make the bitter pills he's pushing down your throat slide down so much more smoothly, almost too easily. As an author, Heller will not rest until you, as the reader, are his equal as a cynic. He pulls it off masterfully, too, his persuasion of patriots into perversion of their most beloved creeds, his destruction of the reader's regard for respected traditions and accepted notions about America.   Through the words of the brash, self-centered Captain Yossarian as well as the from the perch of omniscient narrator, Heller tells it like it is (says he). The world is a petty place, and survival is job one. That Yossarian, as the antihero, would shamelessly sabotage the arrangement of a dangerous support mission rather than risk his neck to help out others reflects a Darwinian influence that resounds without compassion. &quot;The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on,&quot; rants Yossarian as he argues with the overly intellectual Clevinger. Yossarian displays no qualms as he announces, with conviction, &quot;It doesn't make a damned bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.&quot;   What makes Heller's work in this novel so excellent is the fact although his ideas are morally bankrupt and bleak, he masks their horrid faces masterfully with his ingenious strokes of hilarity. The outstanding comedy put forth by Catch-22 is surely enough proof that Joseph Heller is none other than the Devil.   And we should all love him for it.
B00005B36H|4.0|There are thousands of long, detailed, song by song reviews of this CD around. This isnt one of them, just my lowly opinion.<br />Lateralus is an immensely wonderful piece of music. Tool is the greatest band of our time. Lateralus would get five stars when compared to any other band. When compared to the perfection of Aenima, it gets 4. Just the way I want to rate it. Yes I would like to bring the score to perfect 5, but I would feel guilty.<br />Lateralus is composed of 4 difft song types. 1) Grudge 2) Reflection 3) Disposition 4) Fiad<br />All the rest of the tracks are similar to the Grudge. <br />It would have been very sweet if there were mor dispositions and fiads because they are really THE new direction of Tool Music. The other two are not; rather they spawn directly out of Undertow and move towards electronics.<br />So the Tool progression really goes Opiate, Undertow, Lateralus, Aenima (not in terms of quality, but in terms of 'out there'/experimentation). I was amazed that the band did not follow the Salival direction (n No Quarter) because that too would have been sweet. <br />In essence I was just surprised by what they did, and liked it. It will be hard for them to top Aenima (with a difft style/approach), but hey, no try = no success. <br />If you are thinking of whether to buy this CD or not, go buy it. If you dont, you are a horrible monster and I will pray for your death every night.
0446677450|1.0|This book is full of little anecdotes that can be summed up in a few words: &quot;in order to be wealthy, come up with a great business idea, incorporate, and work for yourself&quot;. The entire book repeats on this theme without giving any new insights on how to develop a &quot;great&quot; business idea or how to implement it.<br />My advice - your first step to financial freedom... save your money, don't buy this book. <br />Also, Kiyosaki, the author himself is not as wealthy as he claims to be.  Do some research for yourself and see what I mean. Like the book, the author is rife with contradictions.
0679905278|5.0|I have been reading this book to my son since he was newborn. He has always been captured by the illustrations. As he grew older he began to recognize the animals. One day, he pointed to the main character, who is not named, and I made up an easy name, &quot;That is Bob&quot;. To this day he asks for &quot;Bob&quot; at bedtime. This book also got us through a rough time. My son was hiting his friends at daycare and causing distress. We began to talk about being gentle all the time, but one day I noticed &quot;Bob&quot; was petting a big green animal where the book goes, / you'll face up to your problems / whatever they are. I began to say, &quot;Oh! Look! Bob is gentle&quot; and I would pet the animal. After a few nights it caught on and we go through the gentle routine to this day. We also like the waiting place. I used to take a lot of time to ask if he sees the kitty, umbrella, baby, etc. Nowdays, my son tells me where things are. I love this book for so many reasons and I feel the positive outlook toward the future is evenly examined with overcoming obstacles. We always end the book chanting &quot;So get on your way!&quot; together.
0393316041|5.0|When I was in high school, my Dad called me up one night to tell me about a NOVA episode he'd seen.  &quot;This scientist wrote this theory called QED, and you'll love it!&quot; he said.  I got my hands on a copy of QED, but didn't understand a word of it!  A year or so later, I spotted &quot;Surely You're Joking&quot; on a bookshelf at school, and recognized the name.  Was this the same scientist who'd written about the photons and path-integrals and other confusing mathematical nonsense?  It was indeed!<br />This book details, in Feynman's own words, various anecdotes which should more properly be termed 'misadventures'.  This nobel laureate relates tales of lockpicking safes at the Manhatten Project, of stealing doors from dormitories, and leaning how to draw as an excuse to see naked women.  It shows that even our greatest scientists can be just regular guys like you and me.<br />Feynman is regarded by the scientific community as one of the greatest minds of our time, on a par with Einstein.  Yet amidst this, he managed to teach me a lesson that helped me become the man I am today: &quot;What do you care what other people think?&quot;  I never knew the man, but his influence is there now in every aspect of my life.<br />This title is recommended for anyone who gets singled out, feels different from people around him, or simply likes a good story!  Love you, Dick!
B00005BJC7|5.0|Kid A was weird, let's face it. It took me a couple of listens to like it, let alone &quot;get it.&quot; But Radiohead, despite the attempts of many, defies interpretation. Yes, we can look and see and maybe get close to what it means. But does it sound good? This is an album, after all.<br />Amnesiac, then, takes a few listens to like also. But this happens with most new Cds people buy, no? First you get familiar with the single and then let the CD play. Same thing goes for this one. Radiohead is doing something new here. One day someone will come up with a name for it. Today, though, with the music playing on my stereo I can only say that the album is original.<br />There are many moods evoked here, especially on a track like &quot;Pyramid Song.&quot; It's a cold-sad song, the kind that many say Radiohead is best at doing. But then there is the other song that makes you feel strong and familar all at once, &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; This song is Radiohead, it starts out slow and simple but then by the end the song explodes into a cry. What kind of cry?<br />It's whatever you want it to be.
0060926317|5.0|I was given this book 9 years ago to read, and have passed it on to friends every chance I get. Right now the bookclub I'm in is reading it, to mixed reviews. This story, true or only true-ish, allows us to glimse at our potentials as limitless beings, on all levels: spiritual, physical, mental. It also reminds us just how easy it is to live on this planet, and how little we need to live extraordinary lives. Its not about having things, or securing ourselves from the natural world. By seeing a community live rich lives in a desert with &quot;no resources&quot; makes our hasty, stressful lives in much more lush climates seem suddenly pathetic. How little we really even observe of our natural surroundings, never mind communing with it. I find myself wishing Marlo were a better writer and could recount some of her experiences more to my literary taste, but the message rings loudly and we can't help but stop and look at ourselves with new eyes.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Steven Soderbergh's Traffic is a wonderful film which follows the lives of three people affected in different ways by Drugs and the War on Drugs. Benicio Del Toro plays a Mexican Cop who, in a country full of corrupt officials, is the one with pure motives.  Michael Douglas is an Ohio Supreme Court Judge who becomes the Drug Czar, America's Leader of the War on Drugs.  Finally, Catherine Zeta Jones is the wife of an accused drug Lord.  <br />While the editing and direction is great, the acting is no less so.  All the actors turned in Stellar performances, but Benicios was by far the best.  HIs award for Best Supporting Actor was well deserved.  <br />Finally, the story itself is timely and engaging without being preachy.  The end of the film makes you think about the war on drugs and how best to combat this problem without preaching to you.  Certainly deserving of it's nomination as Best Picture. The first thing you will notice is the different filters and film used for the various story lines.  The Mexican side of the story is shot in Super 8 and therefore quite grainy.  Michael Douglas' shots are done with a blue filter and Catherine Jones' shots are more golden.  I loved this technique not just cause it was different but it added to the telling of the story.  The Mexican portions are much more gritty, hence the use of Super 8.
B00003W8NM|5.0|....<br />Regarding the DVD &#8211; buy it.  It is simply the best.  Many of the reviews here complained about the violence, stated that showing the spiral to bottoming out was unnecessary, etc.  Did they watch the same movie I did?  The spiral is an essential part of the story &#8211; critical in every way.  The violence is not gratuitous whatsoever.  In fact, it is one of the rare instances where violence was in no way gratuitous, but completely essential to the plot.<br />As far as the violence, it certainly could have been far more graphic than it was.  I think the balance was beautifully done.  One of the things that made the movie truly great was the balance of violence to the tender message of the human condition in this era of history.
B00004Y87O|1.0|DVD and John Carpenter fans (of which I consider myself both) - a new transfer &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD of &quot;Escape From New York&quot; is due this fall, or at the latest, by early 2002. Refrain from buying this release; as one who owns Image's terrific 1996 laserdisc release of the film (with great commentary from both Carpenter and Kurt Russell), I can tell you that this DVD release by MGM is terrible in its quality. Whatever aged master elements they struck the print from are NOT what Image used. This transfer is terrible... hold onto your wallets and wait for the new release.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Our toddler is at the repetition stage, so we listened to portions of this album approximately thirty times on a recent long car trip.  Amazingly, none of the adults were sick of it - in fact, my mother, husband and nanny want a copy for their cars.  Despite the wide range of artists, it hangs together as an album and provides a nice variety of tempos and styles.  The family's favorite cut: the unexpurgated version of &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain.&quot;  Unlike the edited version we knew as kids, the original hobo's dream includes cigarette trees and a &quot;lake of stew and of whiskey, too&quot;.  My toddler broke into a huge smile every time it came on and the grown-ups had contests to see who could sing all the words without foul-ups.
B00003CXAY|5.0|I was already a Philip Glass fan when koyaanisqaatsi was shown on HBO or something.. (dont call me..the tapes about worn out)      When the Powers that Be get their heads out of the dark place they will find that this and powaaqattsi will be a big seller on dvd
B00005B36H|5.0|TOOL delivers their most intelligent and exciting work yet.  The words to \\"Schizm\\" (REDISCOVER COMMUNICATION) and \\"Grudge\\" quench my thirsting intellect, and Maynard James Keenan's unbelievable vocals evoke incomparable bodily chills.  I'm so glad I get the message here, that people are losing touch with each other, that personal growth is only attained through introspection and genuine human interaction--to embrace communication. ....
B000002KDZ|4.0|Jorge Santana is good. The album has the familar Santana sound but lacks a little depth. Almost there but not Carlos....
B000002H33|5.0|This is definitely the best Metallica album.  This is true quality Metallica.  Better than the overated Ride The Lightning and Kill Em All.  And ALOT better than the &quot;sellout mid '90's&quot; Metallica.  The guitars work is underated.  The lyrical work is excellent.  The drums are the best on any Metallica album.  Cliff does an excellent finale.  NOBODY will ever copy him ever again.  The tracks here are just straightforward exxcellent.  The best track is Disposible Heroes.  This and the title track are alone reason the buy this.  All the tracks are very good or better.  More favorites are Battery and The Thing That Should Not Be.  Buy this CD!!!
B000002JKA|5.0|These guys are insanely good.  If you are a musician buy this cd right now!!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|The first video from Amnesiac (for &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;) is very similar to the experience of listening to the album: you feel as if you are floating, drifting, diving, in a barely recognizable landscape. And in the end, when you choose to stay down, it is the best choice. Who would want to leave this dreamlike landscape?
0767903862|5.0|I lived in Oz for 20 years and I can vouch for Bryson's getting it dead right! The guy's talent for acute observation coupled with wry humour is nothing short of astounding. It's all there . the big country, the variety of nasty beasties ready to sting and bite you, the friendly inhabitants with their outgoing confidence on the one hand and their insecurity with respect to the big world outside on the other. This book brought it all back brilliantly. However, be careful - if you read on the train home, you'll get very odd looks as you constantly break into sniggers. It's that sort of book. Well done, Bill Bryson.
B00005B4GU|4.0|So, I just picked up Amnesiac.  Having read all of the press and comments by the band about it I wasn't sure what to expect.  Some said it was another major departure, others that RH was getting back closer to their roots.  I don't agree with either perspectives.<br />You can tell that Amnesiac was from the same sessions and live shows, but it is decidedly different.  Amnesiac is darker, sometimes brooding, but it does it with intricately orchestrated acoustic and electronica-type layered sound. Radiohead continues to innovate and redefine themselves - showing again why they are not going to be figured out by anyone but themsleves. The music is diverse compared to Kid A, but still very much part of an album.  Yorke's vocals are haunting and show his talents much more clearly than ever before.  The tracks are orchestrated brilliantly by the band - and if you listen closely, you'll probably hear more &quot;traditional&quot; types of jazz and blues progressions.  They are woven into a fabric of electronica synth beats and dissonant chords.  It's truly incredible and a testament to how talented RH players are.  You might think that this wouldn't work aurally, but it is surprising how well the sounds blend.<br />Amnesiac is an easier listen though than Kid A, simply because there is more track-friendly structure.  Don't mistake this as returning to their roots though, it's just the next evolution.  Die-hard RH fans will probably be surprised at some of the songs style and &quot;OK Computer fans&quot; will be happy to have something more recognizable.  Regardless, it's great to have yet another RH album.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is in my opinion the second best Metallica album (after Master of Puppets.)  The Black album is the third.  This is probably the heaviest album by the group.  The guitars are absolutely amazing.  The drums are not much but they fit in with the guitar sound.  I don't hear that much bass in here.  Maybe none at all.  The vocals are probably the best behind Master of Puppets.  Each song has an explanation.  The production is not well but you don't want it overproduced like the later albums.  It sounds fine to me.<br />     And this album has &quot;One&quot;, the best Metallica and one of the best songs ever, overall.  One, is the alone reason to buy it.  But there is plenty more on here.  Eye of The Beholder and Harvester are two more radio hits.  All tracks are good.  Not a single &quot;crap track&quot;.  I'm a fan of the 80's Metallica.  I prefer both Master of Puppets and this over Kill Em All and Ride The Lightning.  They are alot mature in Master and Justice.  Buy this CD!!!
B000002UAR|5.0|This may or may not be the greatest album of all time.  It is probably the most original, but there is now real way to narrow it down to one single album.  But this should rank high on any list.<br />TAXMAN- Great song to open the album,and the only George song to open a Beatles album. Possibly George's best song.  His sneering vocal delivery, bitter lyrics, and the excellent bass from Paul all make this a classic.  And how about that guitar solo?<br />ELEANOR RIGBY- Classic, excellent strings.<br />I'M ONLY SLEEPING- This is one of the best on the album, and it is one of the first songs to feature backwards guitar.<br />LOVE YOU TO- Another one of George's best songs.  This is probably my favorite song on the whole album.  <br />HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE- This is a beautiful ballad, but it may be my least favorite song on the whole CD.   <br />YELLOW SUBMARINE- Classic song. Sounds a bit out of place on this album, but does add a touch of comic relief.<br />SHE SAID SHE SAID- One of the finest songs, inspired by John's meeting with Peter Fonda.<br />GOOD DAY SUNSHINE- Catchy pop song.  Great drumming and piano.<br />AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING- One of my favorites, and it has some of George's best guitar work.<br />FOR NO ONE- Very moving song, another one of Paul's best tracks.  Nice horn solo by Alan Civil.<br />DOCTER ROBERT- Very funny song about a drug dealer.<br />I WANT TO TELL YOU- More classic George, not as good as his other songs on this record, but still great.<br />GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE- One of the best songs on the CD. I love the use of brass and George's guitar break.<br />TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS- Wow.  What can I say about this track?  Very, very weird lyrics, and some very weird tape effects.  Ringo can make one helluva groove.<br />This album shows the Beatles' musical diversity and revolutionary recording techniques.  This album has it all, ballads (For No One, Here, There and Everywhere), pop songs (I Want To Tell You, Got To Get You Into My Life), guitar rock (Taxman, And Your Bird Can Sing), and brilliant psychadelic excursions (Tomorrow Never Knows, Love You To, I'm Only Sleeping).  For my money, this is the greatest album of all time, but it is really just a matter of opinion.
0060955775|5.0|This is a simple and touching story about a young girl called Veronika who seems to have nothing, yet everything wrong with her life. After a failed suicide attempt, Veronika is sent to a mental hospital where she is told, she is to live only a week as a cause of her failing heart. It is in this madness that she finds the meaning of love and of life. I read this book in one sitting and it really got me thinking. The language in the book flows and the ideas behind the story are thought provoking. All in all, an excellent read.
B00004Z311|5.0|I rated this movie 5 stars because it is my favorite movie, incidentally, journey seems to be the favorite band of every person I know who shares my belief that this is THE greatest movie.(Don't ask me why) I am so glad to see some people making intelligent remarks about the movie instead of verbally killing it like most. WHY CAN'T PEOPLE JUST WATCH A MOVIE AND EITHER ENJOY IT OR NOT??? Why do we analyze and pick movies apart, just enjoy it, a movie wasnt a flop because 2 billion people didnt LOVE it. Critics are so ridiculous, they have to pick apart everything. When I watch a movie, I don't give one thought to a line that wasnt perfec, or any other nonsense, I just become emersed in the movie, and then when it's over, if I am sad to come back to the real world, IT WAS GOOD!! Like the new movie pearl harbor, I liked it alot, and NO i didnt even stop one second to think of something I didnt like about it. When &quot;screw ups&quot; were brought up later, I remembered them, but DIDNT CARE. NOTHING IS PERFECT. Legend is the only movie i would give up my whole movie collection for. SO WHY,WHY,WHY havent they released it yet, WHAT IS THE HOLD-UP??? I still havent seen the un-cut version that comes with the dvd. If a movie is so good it is your favorite, PLUS you cant think of anything to improve it, then somebody tells you 20 minutes were cut and the music was different, etc, and that the uncut version was so much better, WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU??? If you can butcher a movie and its still fantastic, that means somebody knew what they were doing to make it. Anyway, all i can say is its the best movie ever, I HATE the fact that it is unreleased and i havent seen it uncut, I hate the way people disect a movie, etc etc. When I finaly do see the uncut version, i am going to be alone, i wont blink, i will make it the ultimate movie watching experience.BUY THIS MOVIE AND WATCH IT OFTEN, IT CAN HELP TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIN WITH ALL THIS FANTASY STUFF&gt;hehehe.
0553565915|5.0|I read this book a few years before grandma's passing but when it came to that unfortunate time, my grandma started showing signs of passing, like when Beatty said she had seen the people at the tunnel waiting and undecided whether to cross over or not.  My grandma said she saw kids playing around her.  Just like she saw the little girl dancing on her husbands foot.  Beatty also mentioned the green pastures, my grandma said she saw everything green, I associated that with the green pastures.  This book made me realize that even though it was the hardest decision I ever had to make, but I had to give my grandmother permission to leave this world and embrace her next life.  If for some reason this could reach the eyes of Beatty J. Eadie please let her know that she has been an inspiration to me, and continue writing.  I enjoy her reading very much.  Thank You Beatty
6305132984|5.0|To comment on the one who took to task the studio for only putting out West Side Story with subtitles of English and French, and not Spanish.  Be it known, that 97% of us in the United States speak english.  Those that do not, could not afford the DVD anyway!  And so what if Natalie Wood did not do her own singing, neither did Deborah Kerr in 'The King and I'.  They were both 'sung' by Marni Nixon, and excellent singer who appears as herself in The Sound of Music as one of the nuns.  The true appeal of West Side Story, is the story....  I suggest one should look at the film as an entertainment value, not as a politically correct venue.....<br />Both the DVD and VCR are an excellent value, worthy of the time spent to view.  Enjoy it, and keep in mind what was intended, entertainment.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album was my first introduction to the Beatles.  I first heard this album last summer when I was 14.  I hadn't been much of a Beatles fan before that, but one day I just decided to buy some of their CDs for the hell of it.  When I got home I slipped on the headphones and put in Sgt. Pepper.  I must have listened to it 5 times that night.  By the time A Day In The Life faded out, I knew I was hooked.  <br />This album is an amazing technical achievement.  The produciton set the standard for many years to come, and also produced many cheap imitations and wannabes.  And how about that cover photo? While it may not be as innovative today as it was in 1967, and the Sgt. Pepper concept pretty much ends after the second song, this is still a stunning recording.  Its hard to believe that this was recorded over 30 years ago. <br />The highlights of the album include the psychadelic classic Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, the hypnotic Indian music on Within You Without You, George's guitar solo on Good Morning Good Morning, and the mini-suite A Day In The Life, which may be the Beatles' best song.<br />I am glad I took a chance by buying this CD along with Abbey Road and MMT.  Those were three CDs I did not regret buying. <br />What I wouldn't give to have been alive during the Summer Of Love!
0792846710|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies ever made. It is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. It is by far one of the greatest movies of all time. I would suggest this movie to anyone who likes evil dead 2, army of darkness and other movies that are funny with a horror twist. <br />If you havent seen this movie and you are causious about buying it, go rent it. You will Love it.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Well let's face it. upon listening to Amnesiac we find no startling difference between it and Kid A. They contain different songs granted but concept wise amnesiac seems to be another dozen songs that weren't on Kid A. This is a far cry from the stylistic evolution we say between &quot;the bends&quot; and &quot;ok computer&quot;.Amnesiac is the kind of rock-sermon made for believers without any attempt to at new radiohead converts. <br />However, honestly what did we expect from an album that was recorded at exactly the same time as Kid A. but despite the similarities. Amnesiac is a decent record in its own right and the bands passion for songwriting/recording is absolutely commendable. (Weezer take note.)  <br />I'm looking forward to the next stage in radiohead's musical journey. It looks as if they may even be able to succeed Sonic Youth as the leaders of the anti-rock revolution.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This album, like its predecessor, will undoubtedly be met with ambivalence. Whereas Radiohead's virtually unparalleled musical talent is unquestionable, as evident from their previous four albums, ten years have allowed a monumental progression from the utterly inspirational archetypical depressing rock song that was 'Creep' to the distorted and jumbled sounds of 'Like Spinning Plates'. Yet, have the band settled inot a pleasing style? Those undyingly engrossed in the plethora of incredible yet individual tracks that populate the earth-shattering albums of 'The Bends' and 'OK Computer' will probably answer &quot;no&quot;. Yet, those who saw at least a glimmer of hope in the awe-inspiring 'Kid A' will instantly surrender to the seductive charm of 'Amnesiac'.<br />It is hard to determine whether Thom Yorke et al have genuinely lost it to the extent that their album cover and inlay suggests, or whether they are justy cashing in on the unprecedented success of their first really different album 'Kid A'. The quality of the tracks, nevertheless, demonstrates the same underlying talent that made miracles in the mid-90s.<br />The opening track 'Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box' immediately hits you with its apparent discordance, yet eventually finds its aesthetically pleasing feet. This pattern is repeated throughout the album, not least in the incredible single 'Pyramid Song' that appears to lack any semblance of a tune until a heart-warmingly brilliant one is settled upon.<br />Heavily piano reliant tunes are a current theme and the fourth track 'You and whose army?' a personal favourite. The entire album, however - in its bizarre yet fascinating distorted nihilsim - is a benchmark tour-de-force of powerful underlying meanings reinforced by equally powerful tunes (with welcome derison of the Brtish PM Tony Blair thrown in).
B00005B4GU|5.0|As soon as Radiohead had released Kid A and gone on tour with those songs many people had speculated as to why some of the best new songs played at the concert were not deemed good enough for that album.Then after all the experimentation of Kid A,some fans were delighted that there were a batch of songs that had the older more familiar Radiohead sound.So when I bought Amnesiac I was expecting to hear a more guitar and drums driven c.d..Well I got that one totally wrong.This is definitely a sister album of Kid A.It's full of experiments,has lots of treated vocals,uses plenty of drum machines and artificial beats-in fact it's even got a reprise of one song &quot;Morning Bell&quot; which was on Kid A.Fortunately I loved Kid A,but I actually think this album is even better from the basic point of view that the songs here while experimental,tend to work better and are more melodic.<br /> The opening seconds of the first song gives our first drum machine-which has an almost Asian/Buddist feel to it.Guitar is very hard to detect on this song,it's full of synth effects.The feel of the song is very quiet and mellow with Yorke's soft and almost untreated vocals warning someone ominously that &quot;he's a reasonable man,so get off his case&quot;.Of course this isn't the first time on this c.d. where the lyrics speak of a threatening defiance.Once again most of the lyrics are very miserable and very beautiful.This is certainly evident on &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; with it's theme of suicide and &quot;black-eyed angels&quot;.This song is driven by  a suitably haunting piano,strings which have a distinctly eastern flavour and the most wonderfully sympathetic drumming you're likely to hear.The next song is more experimental then anything on Kid A!What sounds like a hammond organ in the background is drowned out completely by the sound of lots of heavy drum machines.And then the vocals are the most treated I've heard yet-I mean it could be anyone.Many critics seem to dislike this song but I actually like it-okay the lyrics may make no sense but it is sort of like Radiohead doing dance music but in a totally unconventional way.<br /> The next three songs are vintage Radiohead and will be the ones most enjoyed by those who liked everything until Kid A.Yes the guitars flourish in these songs.The first one &quot;You And Whose Armies&quot; once again sees Yorke having a defiant dig at someone.It all remains very quiet until 2 minutes in,it reaches a glorious finale with the full band and piano joining in.The next song is one of the best from any Radiohead album.Driven by an excellent meaty almost blues guitar riff.This one will certainly satisfy those older fans.The vocals are not very prominent on this song but then they're not of the treated variety-no this one is Jonny Greenwood's song.The break in the song is also excellent.&quot;Knives Out&quot; is also excellent and could have come from The Bends.Acoustic and gentle electric guitar dominate this song.Vocals are strong,louder and clear as day-but the theme and sound of despair once again.Make no mistake this c.d. won't be used to cheer people up.<br /> I'm not sure why Radiohead have put out Morning Bell on this c.d. also.Okay it does sound different,more full on melodic then it's Kid A version and lyrically it's more distinct and very dark.Song 8 &quot;Dollars And Cents&quot; is a really good song.The guitar is gently strummed but it is slightly distorted and sounds really interesting.The drums are gentle with an almost jazzy feel and this is all backed beautifully by strings or a synth that sounds very like a full on string section.The multi-layered vocals also give this song an eerie hypnotic feel.Then we have a 2 minute blues guitar instrumental which is very atmostpheric.Spinning Plates uses lots of technology,so much so that I'm convinced it's the sound of several instruments played backwards but speeded up.The last song is very unusual in that it sounds like a New Orleans funeral march.They use veteran British jazzman Humphrey Lyttelton,who I'm sure helped compose the cacophony of brass sounds that dominate this song.Very different for Radiohead and it goes to show that this is a group constantly evolving.Good as a once off but I hope they don't do a full jazz album for their next creation.<br /> All in all I loved Kid A but I like this album even more.I've played it now 5/6 times find it's more accessible then it's predecessor.They still have all the experiments,it's just that the songs are way better.
B000007MVD|5.0|This album is a very good collection and will be worth buying for the hardcore Beatle fan.  Some of the sound quality is poor in spots, but over all it is very acceptable.  I have the older version released in 1995, and I'm not sure if there are any real differences between the two versions. This 2 CD set features many songs that are unavailable on any other recording.  Highlights include covers of Chuck Berry's Johnny B. Goode and Too Much Monkey Business, Lucille, and many other great covers and some well known originals. If you want to hear how the Beatles sounded live in the early days, then you'll want to pick up this set. Good liner notes too.
0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha is a very simple story, but powerful and enlightening.  Readers who are interested in Buddhist philosophy and the life of Buddha, can learn much in this fictional tale in a couple hours.<br />But this is not just a work of fiction.  For one thing, Siddhartha's life roughly parallels the actual Buddha's.  But also, this book surely has a practical purpose, and so it seems more like a parable.  What are the important things in life?  How do we appreciate life?  What teachings do we follow?  What makes us happy?  These are questions we all have (most of us, at least) at some point in time, and Siddhartha's whole life story is about finding these answers.  He seeks happiness by taking on many forms, from ascetic, to merchant, to ferryman, and finally, when he stops seeking, he comes to understand what wisdom is.<br />The individualism in the book spoke to me strongly.  Though he is seeking enlightenment, and though he seems to agree with the Buddha's teachings, Siddhartha rejects the opportunity to become a follower and learn from him.  He figures that the Buddha himself arrived at enlightenment not through teachings, but through experience.  And so, with the thought that wisdom is not communicable, he seeks it through his own experiences as well.  And here is the real message beyond what he explains at the end.  You have to seek your own way.  You have to learn through experience and perhaps even suffering.  And you have to contemplate and listen.  In some way, you even have to reject this book itself.  It isn't going to enlighten you.  After you read it, you must go out into the world and enlighten yourself.
B000002504|3.0|Underated UK band scored a bit in NE US in early-mid 70's. Those uninitiated should think Caravan/Tull. Whimsical and symphonic, their off beat submissions are neither good or bad; just easy on the ears and endlessly lstenable. Hmm!
0871137380|5.0|Bowden's account of the October 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in which eighteen American soldiers were slain is a gripping blow-by-blow account of this horrific fifteen-hour battle.  He has interviewed dozens of Army Rangers, Delta force operators, pilots, and Somalis, combed through the archives and pieced together the battle in a running minute-by-minute chronology that puts the reader in harm's way.  This is a tough book to put down.  The soldiers are put into context, their lives, their training, their camaraderie, but are yanked out of any political picture.  They are soldiers, doing their jobs and trying to stay alive and complete a mission.  Aside from a brief epilogue, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" does not seek to characterize the broader mission in Somalia from start to finish nor frame the reason for these troops' presence in Mogadishu, nor engage in any real post-mortem.  This is the story of  a brief and now nearly-forgotten battle.  It is gory and heart-wrenching and full of chaos and noise.  It is a powerful book.  Not a political analysis but a true story of war.
B00004TJLD|4.0|Since DVD-Audio discs didn't start appearing until late-2000 and this has a date of January 1, 2000, I doubt this is a DVD-Audio disc.  What it may be is a 96kHz, 24-bit stereo DVD-Video disc without any video.  This was a temporary format that was used until DVD-Audio became available.  <br />Warning - this disc is likely stereo not 5.1-channel.
B000002UAF|5.0|This is definitely the best early Beatles album, and is one of their most under-rated. It has some of their best and most famous songs (Can't Buy Me Love, And I Love Her, title track), and many lesser known gems like I'll Cry Instead, You Can't Do That and If I Fell, which is one of Lennon's best ballads.  This is definitely essential stuff and is a fine album to start your Beatles collection with.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is one big sonic milkshake.  There are no ends or beginnings or ends or beginnings, it just goes on and on.  I cant stop the cd, it is now in it's fourth rotation and I feel like I'm trapped in some far off galaxy that I never want to come back from.  At first I thought it sounded kinda slow , but then it starts to pull you in.  Soon you have taken so many combinations of left and right turns that you're totally lost. This album does hint at Kid A but it is very different and very very solid.  I think Kid A is great, but this album caters to a different mood.  It's dark but not depressing.  The noise is just too blissful to be sad, but it is very emotional.  I reccomend Ok computer before you get this album.  I think &quot;OK&quot; is a good first album cause it is a very agreeable sound and is flawless. I think this is a must have for any collection.  These guys are stretching the realm of Rock and incorporating all we've allready learned about good music into their work.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|The critics are mixed on the movie, but I loved it- It is funny, sad, its happy, its cute its just an enjoyable movie, with great music.
B00003CXN4|5.0|This movie is a must-see for everyone.  It is a great portrayal of those who are involved in the smuggling, usage, and law enforcement aspects of the drug scene.  The acting was superb, even by Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Anyone who wants to watch a movie that does more than let your brain sleep for a couple of hours will get swept away by Traffic.  I bought it the first day it was released.
B000002UAO|5.0|RUBBER SOUL is the Beatles first masterpiece, and the original UK version is far better than the American LP.  This is how the Beatles themselves intended it, not some hack from Capitol Records.  <br />DRIVE MY CAR is an excellent opening track. It was chopped off of the original American record and was replaced by It's Only Love. <br />NORWEGIAN WOOD is about one of John's real-life affairs, and it is my favorite song on the album.  It is probably the first time the sitar was used in popular music.<br />YOU WON'T SEE ME, great pop from Paul, and has some fine drumming from Ringo.<br />NOWHERE MAN, one the best tracks on the entire album, and it was cut off the American record.<br />THINK FOR YOURSELF, good track from George, not his best but still very good.  Nice fuzz bass.<br />THE WORD, very much in the same vein as ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE, but this track is much better.<br />MICHELLE, classic Paul.  Beautiful melody.<br />WHAT GOES ON, country song co-written and sung by Ringo.  Neither bad nor great.<br />GIRL, more classic Lennon.  He dominates this album.<br />I'M LOOKING THROUGH YOU, great Paul track, features Ringo on Hammond organ.<br />IN MY LIFE is possibly the Beatles' best song, and may be the greatest song ever written.  Excellent keyboard solo.<br />WAIT, more classic stuff.<br />IF I NEEDED SOMEONE, George's best song up to this point.  Great lyrics and a hypnotic guitar intro.<br />RUN FOR YOUR LIFE is Lennon at his most jealous.  One of the weaker songs on this CD, but it features some great guitar work.<br />Rubber Soul is essential to everyone's music collection.
B00005B4GU|5.0|For those of you radiohead fans who are seeking a follow up to KID A, it has arrived. However, the similarities between the cd are few. Amnesiac stays in Radiohead's mode of experimental rock, but the experiment are entirely new. The cd opens with &quot;Packt like sardines&quot; which feels an awful lot like a Depeche Mode song. The cd moves on to &quot;pyramid song&quot;. This song is starts radiohead into more familiar waters. The cd has the beautiful melodic vocals of Thom York with many strange and creative memories. It will fit in any cd collection perfectly next to the other Radiohead cd's and it is destined to be worn out in my cd player. You don't just listen to Radiohead's music, you experience it.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This film was the best film I have seen in ages. The cast is absolutely unbelievable especially Jared Leto as Harry Goldfarb. The cinematography was simply breathtaking from the fast forwarded shots to the achingly beautiful drug taking scenes. <br />Ultimately tragic, amazingly affecting, emotional and moving, I cannot recommend this journey into private hell enough. <br />The loss of hope is the ultimate requiem.
1568495110|3.0|&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is a good book, maybe even great, but it falls short in a few areas.  I guess the most major is language.  The dialect of the boys, although entertaining, overshadows the story itself to some point, and is little more than a device to smooth over some of the rougher areas of the literature. Despite that, it was a good, even touching story despite the raw violence that seemed to jump off of every page.  Yet despite their raping and beating and killing you manage to feel some compassion for the boys.  I won't give away the ending, but in a mark of true fiction, you find the signs of a character who is dynamic both inside an dout in Alex, the leader of the boys.  I think it is a good book because it takes a satrical look at the side of society that is too often ignored, although perhaps not so much satrical as just a magnified projection.  However, the language (for me) and the violence (for others) prevent me from recommending this book to everyone.

B00005BF9Z|5.0|Manu Chao comes again with his &quot;right&quot; ececltisism and world view, but in a different way, this album is more a &quot;happy&quot; album than clandestino, but this isn't mean that he forgot his fight causes, the &quot;clandestino&quot; and the &quot;desaparecido&quot; also lives in Proxima Estacion, Esperanza but with a different attitude, this &quot;clandestino&quot; know how to live a happy life, a special mention for the songs &quot;Promiscuity&quot; and &quot;la chinita&quot;, has more english songs than clandestino (Merry blues, Promiscuity, Trapped by love, Rendez-vouz, Mr. Bobby), 6 in spanish, 3 in portugesse, and a instrumental-collage mix defines the new masterpiece of this music globewalker.
B00005ATQM|5.0|If you're like most everyone else, you already own the CD. I just bought the DVD-Audio version. There is no contest between the CD and DVD versions.  The DVD blows the CD away! Just listen to &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;. With the awesome drumming by Lars, it feels more as if he is pounding on your head.  It sounds that powerful. The Dolby Digital 5.1 mix is almost as good as the Advanced Resolution 6.0 mix!  It feels like you're actually sitting in on a jam session with James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Jason Newsted! If you own even just a regular DVD player, go and buy this version of one of the best albums of all time!  What more can I say?
B00005B4GU|5.0|They did it again. If you liked Kid A you are gonna love this album, because it's probably besser. There are not enough words to express what I felt when listening to it. There are lots of good songs: &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; is a masterpiece and &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot; is magic. If you don't buy this CD it's because either you don't have any money or you don't know what music is. Thank you.
0201633612|4.0|The first time I picked up this book, I found it dry, and tough to read.  I bravely worked my way through almost two hundred pages because I thought these were things I should know, but had to put it away because I was falling asleep.  I realized when I put the book down, that I had remembered only maybe half a dozen things, and those only in an abstract sense.<br />There were a couple things wrong about my approach.  First, although I fancied I was a reasonably seasoned programmer, I was not a seasoned OO programmer even in my own imagination.  Second, I read and read and read without coding, or even looking at any code.  This is really much more useful as reference work than a textbook.  Don't expect to pick it up, and learn good OOD without writing a lot of code along the way.<br />Do go back to this book repeatedly as you are developing as an OO programmer.  First, it gives you a vocabulary for common patterns as you encounter them, which helps you not only communicate with team members (by virtue of being canon, the book's vocabulary is widely understood), but also think about the problems yourself.  Second, it gives some very good advice on the use of these patterns and their use together, which means that as well as being canon, it's &lt;gasp&gt; darn useful.  <br />I won't say that it's a must for every shelf... if you're not working in an OO language, even if the concepts are nice, many will not have reasonable, automatic translations into your language.  However, if you are an OO programmer, you'd be missing out if you didn't have the ability to flip this book open at odd intervals when considering your design.
0735201684|5.0|This is an excellent book that teaches how to consciously program your subconscious mind to become the person you want to be.  If you want to be more confident or emotionally assertive, simply program yourself before you sleep and after you sleep and with consistency and belief, the subconscious mind will bring it to you.<br />This definitely worked for me and I still continue to apply these concepts daily.  Buy this book and you will definitely see the incredible changes.
B00000D9TK|5.0|I think this is the best I've heard from Celine Dion , both in English and French. Personally, I think that &quot;Papillon&quot; and &quot;L'Abandon&quot; are the best songs in the cd. I simply love it when she goes incredibly high especially in &quot;Dans Un Autre Monde&quot; and when she goes very soft for those sentimental songs such as &quot;S'Il Suffisait D'Aimer&quot; and &quot;Je Chanterai&quot;.<br />I can only describe this album in one word : &quot;PARFAITE !&quot;. Go on and buy it now !
B00005B4GU|4.0|on kid a radiohead was bold. they split from a formula that gave them much accolades (great songs, relatively  straight-forward instrumentation) and elicited some great combonations of electronic experiment and pure emotion. Amnesiac, originally to be called kid b, is culled from the same recording sessions as last october's release, kid a. After two listenings to Amnesiac i feel a little gyped; it's not that i don't like the album(i know it'll be on the stereo alot for the next few weeks) but the sensation that they could have avoided releasing this recording until after the band is defunct haunts me(the 'lost' tapes). There are none of the true emotional statements heard on kid a. It's more like listening to what was weeded out from kid a. Of course, i expected alot from them; more of the release and salve as on OKcomputer's Airbag.  But nothing jumps out at you here. I doubt if radiohead band members will really want to include many of these tracks on their upcoming concert song lists.  Listen before you buy.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Recorded at the same sessions that produced Kid A, this is essentially more of the same. Not that there's anything wrong with that. If every band made CD's as good as this one I'd bankrupt myself buying new music. This is brilliant stuff: edgy, inventive and addictive music permeated with the band's fetish for moody electronica.
0671015206|3.0|This book definitely showed me an uncommon approach to becoming wealthy (being frugal).  However, I'd rather be rich by being intelligent than being frugal becuase what is the point of being rich with being cheap?  You don't get to enjoy it.  However, this book does show how one can become wealthy by being cheap.<br />Despite the philosophy being interesting, the book is written in a very dull manner.
B000003BDY|2.0|'Hey guys! Let's build an album around our new hit single, throw in the contents of a British EP (5x5, funnily enough), and pad out the rest with some half-baked covers!' This one's just alright. The songs from the EP are excellent, and the mix of R&amp;B/Chuck Berry rock is fine enough, but it just doesn't add up to anything more than a dozen tracks selected pretty much at random. High point: It's All Over Now, of course.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|After making the exciting Romeo and Juliet with Leo DiCaprio this is the only way Baz Luhrmann could top himself. Moulin Rouge virtually rocks. I dread musicals myself and I was skeptical going into this one but Nicole and Ewan can actually sing. The director makes it look real smooth when the actors break into song. And it doesn't hurt that he chose some of the best written songs for them either. Ewan McGregor is actually beleivable when he breaks into what might be the most beautiful song ever written--&quot;Your Song&quot; (Elton John, Bernie Taupin). You're gonna Love It, Love It, Love It.
B00005BF9Z|3.0|This world-music CD comes close to being one of those concept albums that serve as a mellow, bohemian backdrop to an all-night study session or an afterparty, that is if you program out the extremely annoying spoken word loops of &quot;Infinita Tristeza.&quot; Chao's less-is-more focus works best on the soft, seductive cumbia (and first single) &quot;Me Gustas Tu.&quot; Evoking the magic of AM radio, wanderlust, and other simple pleasures, the song effectively transports you to another time and place. Unfortunately, the track is part of a mini-suite that includes the pointless &quot;La Primavera,&quot; in which Chao smugly calls out random places like Gibraltar and Japan as if simply mentioning them comprised relevant commentary. On &quot;Promiscuity&quot; he sounds like he's trying to protest something, but good luck figuring out what. His ode to Mad Cow disease, &quot;La Vacaloca&quot; similarly fails to say anything trenchant.<br />On the upside, the transitions between rhythms, from reggae to swing to ragtime to cumbia, sound seamless and organic. And the musicians are obviously playing with feeling. But ultimately, Chao repeats himself too much to make this CD a keeper. At best it's background music, though track 17 complicates that idea.
B00005J6UP|5.0|i cannot think of a better movie.  it will never get old.  my best friend and i used to watch it every day.  even 15 years after it was made, still the all time best movie!  cant wait to get it on DVD!
B000003BE4|3.0|The Stones' pre 1967 US albums are all inferior in conception, track listing and sound to the original UK issues, which the band took time over. This is probably the only exception, and that's mainly because it includes the hit singles The Last Time and Satisfaction, both all-time classics; the rather funny Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man; and the irritatingly catchy One More Try. Elsewhere the band throws in a slew of soul covers and offcuts. It's a shame the original UK Out Of Our Heads, something of a soul 'concept' album, isn't available in place of this good but mixed collection.
B00005B4GU|5.0|&quot;Amnesiac&quot; together with &quot;Kid A&quot; are my favorite albums of the last 10 years. &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is truly a great album, but one should be amnesiac in order to think this album is different from &quot;Kid A&quot;. In fact Radiohead wants you to think this album isn't a &quot;Kid B&quot; but that just what it is.  I would even say each track on the album has its &quot;Kid A&quot; equivalent. This isn't surprising because it was recorded at the same sessions. Just look at it as a collection of unreleased tracks, or b-sides, that has come out now instead of 30 years from now as another well-known band loves to do. <br />One of the great effects of &quot;Kid A&quot; is making all the rock-lovers, that until then praised guitar-based albums, yell at those who said that &quot;Kid A&quot; is a bad album  because it has no guitars in it.     <br />The songs on &quot;Amnesiac&quot; are all great. The music sounds somewhere between the work of a true genius and the experimentation of a curious child. Sometimes it makes you ask &quot;Thom, what are you doing???&quot;  especially the last two songs: On &quot;Like spinning plates&quot; its the bizar electronics and on the  magnificent &quot;Life in a glasshouse&quot; it's the wonderful jazz-like  arangement of the instruments.  Also notable: &quot;Pyramid song&quot; and &quot;You and whose army?&quot; as   quiet songs, and &quot;I might be wrong&quot;, &quot;Pulk/pull revolving doors&quot; as the noisier answer.<br />This album, like &quot;Kid A&quot;, is not very friendly at the first listening. But it becomes more and more hypnotic as you go on listening to it time after time. As i said, this is a great album, so go on and buy it!!!
0312243022|4.0|The Hours is gutsy. By using segments of Woolf?s Mrs. Dalloway as the headers to his chapters Cunningham dares to set himself up alongside Virginia Woolf as an author of equivalent skill and voice. The segments of text from Mrs. Dalloway not only serve to remind the reader of the context of the book and set the tone of the novel (which he admirably emulates and extends), but also provide a foundation off of which he can leap into the work, as if saying ?look at me! See how well I can write?? <br />In most cases this would be presumptuous and ineffective, but, to Cunningham?s credit, he pulls it off. His work is not only as strong in voice as Woolf?s, but equally, if not more, intelligent and layered. From recreating Clarissa Dalloway?s world in Woolf?s inspiration to a biting analysis of post-war and modern-ay lifestyles, he forces the reader to tackle everything that Woolf put forth in her work, as well as throwing modern-day drama into the mix. We are drawn into an unerringly and deceptively flat world with a veneer of peaceful domesticity and shepherded by characters on a lovely jaunt through various flower-shops of Western civilization. Jumping into the text is far more than the ?lark and plunge? that Clarissa sarcastically imagines. Weaving together a multitude of trends and references throughout the text, Cunningham takes what appears to be a previously explored unidimensional them and builds upon it to create a thoroughly engaging, deeply and bitingly intelligent work that requires and merits the reader?s full attention all the way through. A definite winner.
B000056K04|3.0|DMB has had some great cd's in the past, but this one just isnt too hot.  The hit &quot; I Did It&quot; got old to soon by overplaying by the radio... but theyre still some good songs like &quot;space between&quot;&quot;What you Are&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;.  If ur looking for a great CD , i dont recomend it, but if u love DMB, buy it anyway
B000003BEV|3.0|Satanic Majesties would never be in anyone's Stones Top Ten -- or even Top 30 -- but it's oddly endearing. Fuzz, love and flowers didn't exactly suit the band, but that's half its charm: it's fun to see the Stones experiment. Interestingly enough, one of the album's defining influences is the music of Morocco -- there's an intriguing Arabic buzz to much of the record (and to its contemporary single, We Love You). Citadel might have been a Stones classic if it had been recorded in simpler form for, say, Aftermath; Gomper is beautifully baroque (despite the ridiculous title; its working title was The Lady And The Lake, which makes more sense). And 2000 Light Years From Home is a blast, pure and simple. It's no Sgt Pepper, or The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn -- or even The Doughnut In Granny's Greenhouse -- but the Stones would make much, much worse records in the years to come than this failed but noble experiment.
B00003CXRP|5.0|\\"Cast Away\\" being Passed over by the Oscar's is one of the Biggest Travesty's in Film History. The Acting, Directing and Production are all Perfectly Pulled off and it manages the Difficult task of pleasing Critics and Audiences. Tom Hanks gives the Powerhouse Performance we All Expected him to and Robert Zemeckis uses All of his Skills to pull off this Monumental Achievement. Even with our Raised Expectations, the film Still manages to give us Everything we Expected And More.<br />Unless you yourself have been Cast Away on an Island for 3 years, you'll know the films story, so I'll keep my Plot Synopsis short. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee whose plane goes down in a storm and he is washed up on the shore of a remote Island... Which becomes his home for 4 Long Years. \\"Cast Away\\" chronicles his Survival, his battles with Starvation, Loneliness and Madness, and finally his Eventual Rescue.<br />There was never a Doubt in the Cinema-going Publics minds that Hanks could pull this role off, his On-Screen Transformation is Truly Something to Behold. The whole film Rests on his sole performance, which made him the Obvious (and Only) choice, I doubt the film would have been given the Green Light had he not been involved. He makes us Feel Every Emotion he faces, he Mesmerizes us with his Traumatised Expressions, and he makes the 143-minute running time feel like an even hour. The Supporting cast have Precious-little time to make an Impression, and not One of them Waste that time. Helen Hunt goes through quite a Transformation too as Chuck's Fiancé, but hers is shown mainly through Facial expression and Body Language. Like Hanks, she Convincingly Conveys to us what She's been through as well, which is a Hell of a lot. Nick Searcy is a Standout as Stan, a Friend of Chucks. His couple of scenes with Hanks are very Heartfelt ones, Sentimental while also very Real. They are also Spectacularly Acted ones, like every other scene in the film.<br />The Screenplayis a Brilliant one, getting Maximum Emotion Impact out of a Situation that Is a tough one to film, but with Zemeckis behind the camera, the filming is in Wonderful Hands. Zemeckis uses Startling Camerawork and Brilliant use of Sounds and Silence to create this Landmark film, in my opinion; he is one of the Best Directors Working Today. \\"Cast Away\\" only Solidifies that Statement.
B00005BJC7|5.0|After Radiohead lost some fans over the electronic, experimental feel of Kid A, they had to convince those lost fans that this would be more like &quot;old radiohead&quot;, less experimental and more direct.  well, this album is a mix between both ok computer and kid a.  there are some songs that sound like they come from kid A- like the first track- Packt like Sardines in a Crushd Tin- with a banging kettle drum and electonic beats.  It sounds somewhat like Kid A's first track, Everything in its Right Place.  Packt like Sardines is a great way to start off the album.  Then we get into the Pyramid Song, a song in heavy rotation on MTV2.  The song is just as abstract as the video.  It ranks on my list as one of the top &quot;easier&quot; radiohead songs, with &quot;how to disapppear completely&quot;, my all time radiohead favorite song, and &quot;exit music (for a film)&quot;.  It then goes into the next song with a heavy, thumping beat.  Its somewhat of a trance-like song, something that sounds like a normal radiohead song with a massive attack remix.  There is alot of variety on this album- it has the same atmosphere as it did on Kid A- dark, mysterious, intricate, spacey, and moody.  Yet there isnt really a song on here that is as emotional or as intense as &quot;Climbing Up The Walls&quot; from Ok computer.  Its a great album all around, and it fails to disappoint from all the anticipation and the hype.  Die hard radiohead fans as myself (i got it at midnight) will embrace this album like every other radiohead album.  We better learn to enjoy it, because they probably wont release another album in about 3 or 4 years, we just got lucky this time. <br /> Yet just like Kid A, (and with all other radiohead albums), you cant judge by your first listen.  Allow the cd to grow on you.  This album, along with Tool's Lateralus, is the best album to come out this year so far, and will definately be on some critic and fan's top ten year lists. <br />The special edition is definately worth investing in- its about 3 times better than the disappointing Kid A special edition.  It is the book that is on the front of the normal CD cover.  It has 32 pages of brilliant artwork in a hardcover book.  Get this special edition if you can find it- its definately worth it....
B000000W5F|4.0|It's a collection of outtakes and rejects dating back to 1973, hurriedly stuck together so the Stones would have some product to push during their 1981 US tour ... and it's still the best album they released in the 1980s. Partly it's the glossy sonic sheen Bob Clearmountain's remix gives the songs; partly it's the division between the 'fast' side and 'slow' side on the original vinyl album; but mostly it's because what's included is very good indeed. Start Me Up is a brilliantly raunchy slice of rock; Neighbours and Hang Fire are satiric in intent and just plain fun in style; and Black Limousine is a gorgeous piece of Chicago blues. Elsewhere, Tops and Heaven experiment with soul forms; Waiting On A Friend is not much, but Sonny Rollins' sax solo is genius ... hell, even Ron Wood's soporific barroom ballad No Use In Crying doesn't outstay its welcome. Probably the last Stones album without a clinker.
B00003CXS4|4.0|&#8220;Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels&#8221; reinvented the British Gangster film and gave the world a Great new director, Guy Ritchie. &#8220;Snatch&#8221; is Guy&#8217;s Second film, and although it doesn&#8217;t reinvent any genres, it is still one of the most Fun Gangster films Ever made.<br />The Story is far too complex to summarize, so I&#8217;ll just jump straight into the Review. Everything that made &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221; such a Success is Here in Abundance, The Oddball Characters, the Ultra-Slick Dialogue, the Over-the-top Violence, &#8220;Snatch&#8221; has Everything &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221; had Except it&#8217;s Freshness and Originality.<br />The Performances, Familiar or Fresh, are Wonderful. The Casting of Brad Pitt and the Creation of his Odd-ball Character was a Stroke of Genius. Vinnie Jones might as well have been called Chris (his character from &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221;), as his Bullet-tooth Vic character here is virtually Identical to him in Every Way. Dennis Farina does his Mob guy routine again and it&#8217;s as Funny as Ever. Jason Statham isn&#8217;t really good enough of an Actor to Lead the film, he fit better as Bacon in &#8220;Lock, Stock&#8221;, the Ultra-Slick dialogue comes out of him a little Stunted, but he&#8217;s Likeable enough. Benicio Del Toro is as Wonderful as Ever, his lack of Screen time downright Angers me. In the end it was Rade Serbedzija as Boris the Blade who I wanted to Win the Day. He is a Character that Cannot be Killed and an Actor who Cannot give a Bad Performance. (eg. &#8220;Eyes Wide Shut&#8221;, &#8220;The Saint&#8221;, &#8220;Space Cowboys&#8221; and &#8220;Mission Impossible 2&#8221;<br />&#8220;Snatch&#8221; has Stacks of memorable scenes, Dozens of Quotable lines and a Cast full of Bad guys and Worse guys who you Can&#8217;t Help but Like. Fans of Crime-Capers, British Humour and&#8230; of course &#8220;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&#8221; will Obviously enjoy this film. They should also check out the Criminally Underrated &#8220;Love, Honour and Obey&#8221;.

Labrie,Petrucci,Portnoy,Myung and Rudness plays a epic and unbeliable concert.,  buy this dvd now!! For the Latin fans: Este tan esperado dvd no decepciona para nada, son unos genios de la musica James canta mejor que nunca , los solos de Petrucci son inolvidables y Portnoy como siempre &quot;el mejor&quot; Lo unico reprochable es que no cuenta con un sonido dolby digital ni dts, pero los materiales adicionales son impagables, tambien cuenta con una opcion de audio donde los integrantes de la banda comentan el concierto y explican la historia.

B000000W5B|2.0|Or, how the mighty hath fallen. Coming after the band's glorious 1968-1972 heyday, Goat's Head Soup was a huge disappointment at the time, and the intervening years haven't made it sound any better. Recorded in Jamaica ... it's mightily slow, even dull; the songs are mostly paint-by-numbers rock (Silver Train, which the band never played live because it sounded too much like the classier All Down The Line; the tedious Hide Your Love; the rockin' but hardly innovative Star Star) or oddities like the 'Son of We Love You' that is Can You Hear The Music. Elsewhere, Dancing With Mr D is a Sympathy For The Devil retread, while Coming Down Again is a Wild Horses ... made listenable only by Keef's anguished vocal.  The hit was Angie, a listenable piece of glammed-up fluff with a wonderful piano solo by Nicky Hopkins; and the forgotten gem is the vulnerable ballad Winter, with a gorgeous vocal by Mick. The band would rebound quickly, but there really isn't that much to draw you back here.
B000059ZLH|5.0|This is a great DVD and I would definately recommend it to any DT fan.  MY only complaint is that the camera never stays on John Petrucci for more than a few seconds.  For those of you who dont know, John Petrucci is one of the best guitarist to ever grace this earth.  If you are buying this video to watch Petrucci go off you may be disappointed, otherwise this is a great purchase.
B00005B4GU|2.0|I love Kid A. It's complete. From start to finish, a beautiful, paranoid masterpiece. Amnesiac is little more than half-baked outtakes from those same sessions. Sorry guys, I'm not fooled.<br />Sure, the band has abandoned familiar song structures. On Kid A, it's fresh. On Amnesiac, it's dull and, in some cases, unlistenable. Yes, there are a few good songs here (Packt like Sardines and I Might Be Wrong are catchy), but the band seems to be lost in some anti-capitalist mumbling rant. Politically bold, but musically, uninspired.<br />It's pains me to hear FIVE straight Radiohead songs that go nowhere. Starting with Knives Out through Spinning Plates, the music is just mush. Knives Out is boring. Sorry folks, this tune doesn't hold a candle to ANYTHING off even The Bends, much less OK Computer. <br />Thom, if you wanna say something daring about how awful the capitalist world is, then say it LOUDLY, BRAVELY, MELODICALLY, maybe you can even throw in a crescendo and chorus?! Then, I'll keep listening. If you can't do that right, then expend your mopey energy elsewhere. Become a poet or something. <br />Enough with the digitized noodling nonsense, pick up some @#*$* guitars and write some songs. We know you guys can. <br />Still listening, a fan
B000000W5N|5.0|Not as apocalyptic a recording as Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers is still the Stones at a peak of greatness. It's the first studio album on which Mick Taylor really makes his presence known, and his partnership with Keith Richards is the stuff of dreams. Not as clearly divisible as 'lead'/'rhythm' might suggest, the entwining of Keith's loose, slashing style with Taylor's cerebral, nervy soloing created a distinctive pulsing rock -- never better than on Can't You Hear Me Knocking. Elsewhere we have the archtypal Stones raunch of Brown Sugar and Bitch; the Stax tribute I Got The Blues; country-rock odes Dead Flowers and Wild Horses; and the harrowing Sister Morphine (actually composed by Marianne Faithfull and Mick). The album ends with the mystical, yearning Moonlight Mile, one of the Stones' very greatest achievements and an oddly overlooked classic. Essential, is all.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|For one of the first times ever, critics and the mainstream rock crowd agreed on one thing. They both loved At The Drive-In. Forming not too far away from my house, its great to see a band like this get so much attention and recognition. Its also nice to see the rock producing god Ross Robinson become a fan of them. Relationship of Command was easily one of, or the best album of 2000. I love Cedric Bixlers dynamic and brilliant words and lyrics, and the genius guitar work of the master mind Omar Rodriguez. After hearing so many mindless ''nu-metal'' acts come out, At The Drive-In was a breath of fresh air. I hope they hurry up and end the hiatus so they can blow us away with some more great tunes.
B000003BF1|5.0|If there was ever an album to end the 1960s, this is it. The smell of the apocalypse is strong, all the way from the opening Gimme Shelter. Elsewhere we find songs about violence (Midnight Rambler), decadence (Live With Me, Let It Bleed), and drugs (Monkey Man), all couched in the language of the blues. A pall of despair hangs over the record, leavened only by the country recasting of Honky Tonk Women and Robert Johnson's gorgeous Love In Vain, until the uplifting You Can't Always Get What You Want, which offers a kind of salvation. Here are some of the most inventive arrangements of any Stones record, setting off perhaps their best, most sustained songwriting effort. (Amazingly, half of Let It Bleed was written and recorded at the same time as Beggar's Banquet, in March 1968.) It's an amazing disc that still sounds mightily contemporary, and you need it.
B000059R8Y|2.0|disappointing, to say the least.  i understand this was an album dedicated to an important family member.  and that the term &quot;reptile&quot; is complimentary.  but with the collection of tracks on this cd, it would have been more appropriate to name it &quot;lizard&quot;, as in lounge lizard.  with the exception of 3 or 4 tracks that were clapton-like, the rest could have been done by any hotel bar band with a decent guitar player.
B000003BES|3.0|It beggars belief that this miserly 12-track US compilation is available on CD instead of the UK edition, which featured more music, all the Stones' A-sides up till the end of 1966, and a better cover. Just chalk it up to good ol' record company exploitation. If you want the early classic singles on a well-compiled CD, you're out of luck, so this or the exorbitantly priced Hot Rocks (or the even more exorbitantly priced London Years set) will have to do. Sigh.
0316776963|2.0|I bought this book because I wanted to get an overview of contemporary Paris and the title came up when I searched for something on that subject.  Reading this to learn about Paris is like reading War and Peace to learn about military uniforms.  There isn't much and what there is is trivial at best.  Beyond that, Sedaris is a Dave Barry wannabe with anecdotes that may stimulate laughter in conversation but usually &quot;clunk&quot; in writing. His chapter about his brother &quot;Rooster&quot; who has a twenty word vocabulary, almost entirely profane, is painful, even to this six year army veteran from a &quot;line&quot; company.
B000000W5P|4.0|It's funny that Some Girls is usually heralded as 'Keef's return' when it just exudes Jagger's sense of irony and sass. (For an example of what happens when Richards is left in charge of a Stones album, see Dirty Work.) This is a Noo Yawk album, pure and simple, revelling in sex, drugs and filth; the 'punks' the band were measuring themselves against were the Ramones and Patti Smith, not the UK bands. And let's defend them against the charge of going 'disco': Miss You is a soul/blues stomper pure and simple. Best tracks? Respectable is a raving rocker the likes of which we hadn't heard since Rip This Joint; Some Girls is a sleazy, cheeky blues; Beast Of Burden's a simple yet effective ballad; and Shattered is simply hysterical, a giddily funny strut around all the best -- and worst -- of the Big Apple. Probably overrated by Stones fans, but still pretty good.
B000050XEI|4.0|The only major complaint I have about this CD is its overall length. Eleven tracks in 34 minutes; that's all you get for this standard-priced CD. Thirty-four minutes happens to be less than half of a CD's capacity, 74 minutes.<br />Besides that, this CD is quite enjoyable. Six of the tracks are &quot;group vocal&quot;; three are solo; and two are non-vocal.<br />In summary, great stress-busting music, just not enough of it.
B000003BF4|5.0|Recorded on a night when they might very well have been the greatest rock and roll band in the world, cherry-picking the best tracks from their last two albums, their last two single A0-sides, and a couple of Chuck Berry covers, all given a brutal refashioning thanks to the Richards/Taylor guitar team (listen to Midnight Rambler and weep). Upfront, in-your-face, apocalyptic by design and taking no prisoners, this is the best live Stones album and certainly one of their best albums ever.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac although recorded at the same time as Kid A, is really nothing at all like Kid A.  In fact you could almost say that Kid A is easy listening when compared to Amnesiac.  Once again, this is not the same Radiohead circa 1997. It is easy to see how much this band has matured emotionally, and most importantly musically.  They are still playing with one hand behind their back (refusing to write stadium-rockers and end up like U2), but still are producing songs that through all the electronic-rock chaos are still more human than anything off of OK Computer.  <br />Kicking off with the electronic drum and keyboard beat of \\"Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box\\", Amnesiac grabs you by the ears and sucks you into Thom Yorke's twisted daydream (nightmare?).  \\"I'm a reasonable man get off my case\\" he mumbles over the hum and buzz of the music.  \\"Pyramid Song\\" is a depressingly sad, neo-piano-ballad that really moves you - \\"I jumped in the river what did I see? Black-eyed angels swam with me\\" Thom almost cry's and it's easy to get teary listening to it.  The pseudo-ambient groove of \\"Push/Pulk Revolving Doors\\" is not your typical Radiohead song (if there is such a thing).  Like the song \\"Kid A\\", Thom's vocals are squashed down into computerised gibberish.  \\"You And Whose Army?\\" is like a re-vamped \\"Karma Police\\", but this time not nearly so serious - it almost sounds like Radiohead are having you on.  \\"Knives Out\\" is a Bends-era sounding acoustic jingle which has some bizarre lyrics - \\"Catch da mouse, squash his head, put him in the pot\\".  Could Thom be describing what he felt people were trying to get him to do with the follow up to OKC? Only Radiohead will ever know the true answer, as no-one in the band is telling.  \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\" is an altered version of the original cut from Kid A, but really sounds nothing like it.  Gone are the slick electric-guitar riffs, instead Colin and Ed pull off heavenly acoustic chords over Thom's incredibly high vocals.   \\"Dollars And Cents\\" contains so many sounds it's hard to tell who's playing what - everything seems upside-down and inside-out, but at the same time coherent to the listener.  \\"Hunting Bears\\" is a brief guitar solo, full of slides and echoes - simple though it may be, it is one of the best songs Radiohead has ever had the courage to write.  It's almost a statement to say \\"forget the last nine songs you just heard, forget your conceptions of what we do, who we are - just listen\\".  What other band in the world could do this in a mere two-minutes? \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" is again another bizarre trip into Radiohead's world - it's like a song was written in perfect order, and they've gone back and through it, creating something totally different.  The closer \\"Life In A Glasshouse\\" is again totally unexpected.  Thom wails over the brass hum of what sounds like a New Orleans' funeral band.  <br />Amnesiac is nothing like what you'd expect it to sound like, but at the same time it's hauntingly familiar.  It will take you some time to appreciate how brilliant it is, but once you relax and give in and allow yourself to enter their world.  This is Radiohead at their best - difficult, inventive, moody, cheeky, bizarre, talented.
B000000W5H|4.0|This may well be the Stones' most underrated album. In 1974 all was far from well in the Stones camp, with Keef a slave to the needle and Taylor growing restless and frustrated. That Jagger was able to pull this one out of the fire is nothing short of remarkable. Mixing the band's traditional rock with experiments in funk and blue-eyed soul, It's Only Rock 'N Roll also has a deeper lyrical focus than anything the band would record in the next decade. In effect, this is a concept album about a rock singer concerned with death, ageing and maintaining dignity in the face of it all (Jagger had just hit 30), and a worthy companion piece to Pete Townshend's more obvious The Who By Numbers. By declaring that 'It's Only Rock 'N' Roll (But I Like It)', Jagger affirms that while rock won't solve the problems of the world, it can help you dance all over 'em. Best track? Time Waits For No One, hands-down: a scary look at mortality with a stinging Mick Taylor solo. That this album is usually dismissed by critics as one of the pieces of ... they recorded after Exile and before Some Girls says quite a lot about cloth ears.
B000002UZ1|5.0|At some point everyone needs an introduction to the Beatles.  Even the greatest of Beatles experts needed to be introduced at some point.  Then, once they have been properly introduced, they can delve more deeply into the album catologue.  The Beatles Blue Album (officially titled 1967 - 1970) is a perfect primer to the Beatles in their post-mop top period.  Sure, there are omissions, but it doesn't advertise itself as a box set and what it contains is fabulous all the way from &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; to &quot;The Long and Winding Road.&quot;  The Beatles were at their creative best at this time, and the variety of sounds and styles is constantly shocking.  Going straight from the playful silliness of &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; to the serious majesty of &quot;Let it Be&quot; still catches me off guard every time.  Also, on disc two you can see that George Harrison has caught up to John Lennon and Paul McCartney as a songsmith (&quot;Something&quot; and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;0 even if he cannot yet match their heights (&quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;Hey Jude&quot; ).
B000003BEM|5.0|This is one of those albums you never want to be without. Apart from the 'big three' tracks, the ironic samba Sympathy For The Devil (whose satiric intent has oft been overlooked by the literal-minded), the Velvets-influenced ode to schoolgirls Stray Cat Blues and the call-to-apathy Street Fighting Man, the mood is relaxed, almost bucolic; the general influences are folk blues heroes like Robert Johnson and Son House. Some of Jagger's best lyrics are to be found within, including the Dylanesque Jigsaw Puzzle, a forgotten gem. No Expectations, too, may well be one of the loveliest, most exquisite things the band's ever done. One quibble lies with the sound, which sounds slightly off from my old LP.
B00004XMTC|1.0|This flim is awful its the worst sean connery bond flim ever made.Its not realy a proper Bond flim. Instead of calling it Never Say Never Again it should be renamed Never Watch It Again. Its suposed to be a remake of Thunderball, but its not its nothing like Thunderball.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is coming from a true Stevie Nicks fans, who honestly has loved everything she has ever done, I think this is the best solo album she has put out.  The Sheryl Crow influence shows in a very positive way, adding just a little bit harder edge.  Very rock and roll, very Stevie, just perfect!
B00004XMTC|1.0|This flim is awful its the worst sean connery bond flim ever made.Its not realy a proper Bond flim. Instead of calling it Never Say Never Again it should be renamed Never Watch It Again. Its suposed to be a remake of Thunderball, but its not its nothing like Thunderball.It's that terrible it should  not realy get one star.
0060392886|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end.  I thought I knew everything there was to know about the Crue and how &quot;bad&quot; they were, was I wrong! They were sooo much badder! This book is a must read for any Motley Crue fan, or any rock and roll fan in general.
B00004TWZK|5.0|Well, what can I say that could possibly do this movie justice? First of all, I bought this movie out of blind faith, off the internet. I had heard great things about it, and as it turns out, they were all true, and Stand By Me has become my favourite film of all time.        First, the story. Four boys from a small, enclosed town in Oregon go on a trip to find the body of a kid their age. This trip proves a catalyst for some strong feeling to emerge, about growing up, growing apart,their families, life in their town and their own mortality. I can understand if from this you think that the film is awfully heavyweight and morbid, but nothing could be further from the truth. The themes are dealt with in a natural, realistic and never overly sentimental way.         The friendship the four boys share, particularly Gordie and Chris is so touching, but again realisticly portrayed.        The acting is phenomenal, no other word for it. The performances Reiner has captured from his cast are fantastic, and he has really captured the atmospherere of Steven Kings' wonderful novella.        This is a rare film in that it is realistic, bittersweet, hilarious in parts, but also heartbreaking. This is a film that has a permanent positive effect on your life, as it makes you reconsider what you hold as valuable. If you do not see this film you have missed out on something more remarkable than you can know. Just listen to all these people who have been so touched and moved by it. A little warning though, if you want to prepare yourself for the events at the end, take note of the newspaper article at the beginning. This is a film that I cannot reccomend strongly enough. If I ever have children, as soon as they are old enough, I am going to show them this film to teach them about the important things in life. If you have children older than 10 or so, don't be put off by the rating, all it is is a bit of swearing, this is a film whose message deserves to be put across.
B000002JPA|5.0|I vivdly remember sitting in my car and listening to some San Diego area rock radio station. All of a sudden I hear something so bizarre that I pull over so I can listen until the song ends. Spacey synthesizers, trash guitar, fretless bass, quasi-operatic singing, all in the same song?!? All held together by Mike Portnoy's incredible drumming. Of course the song was &quot;Pull me under&quot; --- I drove to the nearest CD store and bought &quot;Images and words&quot;, DT's then freshly released debut. &quot;metropolis part 1&quot; became perhaps their other signature song. Tied for 2nd best of their albums with &quot;Awake&quot;, SfaM being uncontested for number one. Then as now, deliberate or subconscious musical quotations abound, as does musicianship.
B00001QEE7|5.0|If you are not charmed by this movie you have no heart.  The score, the voice talent, and the character animation all make this one of the finest animated films ever, but it is the brilliant and touching lyrics of the late Howard Ashman that set this film apart.  This is a movie for all ages to cherish forever.
B000002JKA|5.0|Possibly their second-best album, after the &quot;Scenes from a memory&quot; tour de force. Musically both kaleidoscopic (from frenetic odd-meter beats to the almost meditative &quot;Space dye vest&quot;) and adventurous. Favorite songs: 6:00 (whew!), Erotomania (a virtuosic instrumental which quotes rhapsodically from much of their work), and -- at the other extreme musically --- the haunting &quot;Space-Dye vest&quot;. The lyrics are perhaps the band's weakest point --- but there's so much delicious instrumental stuff going on that you hardly notice the lyrics, and relate to the singer as the fifth instrumentalist. Unapologetically theatrical, but with the musical chops to back it up. These guys are not just very much masters of their respective instruments, but also mesh into each other like gears. Wide awake indeed!
B00003CXN4|1.0|This may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot goes nowhere. There is no action per-say. The acting wasn't that great. I can't belive this film won 4 acadamy awards. Bottom line this film was realy bad!
6304263465|1.0|Mmmmmm...Michael J. Fox in a wolf costume...tasty!  What more can I say about such a great movie?  Well, let's give it a try.   Favorite Character: Styles (played by Jerry Levine).  What an actor.  Sorry to see he didn't make the trip to Tenn Wolf, Too!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Sorry, but whether the critics want to admit it or not, Amnesiac is filled to the brim with great music. Of course it's difficult to compare this album to Kid A because Kid A was so hyped up - it was the band's first release in more than three years. Amnesiac was released just months after their previous album (a Radiohead rarity) so there was less time to become excited over a new album, less anticipation, and a greater expectation of wanting to hear something different. What we find on Amnesiac are not Kid A's leftovers; they combine to convey a different theme and a different atmosphere altogether. It's sadder. It might even be MORE beautiful. To all of those out there who say Amnesiac doesn't have any melodies at all, maybe you should take another listen... The melodies are there, though they may be hard for the teeny-bopper public to appreciate to the fullest extent. The band still uses intruments, just different ones. It a sound previously unheard and even unexplored... Radiohead has recorded every dream in the world. Whatever anyone else might say, Radiohead is still releasing great music - and ten years from now we'll all look back on it and say &quot;Wasn't that great, wasn't that terrific, oh weren't they just soooo influential?&quot; H'm.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I've been listening to this CD ever since seeing the movie.  I went directly from the theater to the music store 2 doors down and promptly bought it as the movie was one of the most riveting and original works I've seen ever.<br />The CD is a mixed bag of the truly &quot;musical&quot; numbers and pop numbers like Marmelade.  A few things are missing that were in the movie which was disappointing and a few songs are missing (like the &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; number and the extended sequence of the group explaining the show) but most everything else is here.<br />Without the accompanying visuals it's definitely not quite as good, but for those who have seen and loved the movie it is a must.  Just to keep living in that wonderfully weird world just a bit longer.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Isn't it amazing that a band as big as RADIOHEAD can make two LPs in less than a year? Well, not really! On this album the Oxford quintet sounds like they can't stop making music all the time. They're moving constantly, and it fits them. The drive is in every song on the album, and that's the best part of it all. The willing to be. There have been lots of rumours that this album should be more like OK COMPUTER or even THE BENDS. It's not! This is not even a KID B as someone might have expected; it's more something that's in the air all the time. Like feelings from all RADIOHEADS albums, colliding in soundscapes and hunting you. It's more of a modern easy listening record that it is a tecno-album. But somewhere, it's just rock anno 2001. Radiohead seems to be unstopable, and this is a good record indeed. This sound more like the record between OK COMPUTER and KID A, than it sounds like RADIOHEAD after KID A, but still there's a few missing links. It's clear that the band want to let the pop melody in again, but the pop melody have only entered with one leg. In many ways KID A is more of a pop album, but this is the soundtrack to the summer 2001. And it's gonna be a good summer!
B00005BJC7|5.0|...you'll love Amnesiac. There's the same electronic/rock crossover, the same mad vocals, the same incredible songwriting, the same experimental vibe, but this is unquestionably a very different entity to the brilliant Kid A. They're left everyone else behind - and I can't wait to see what they come up with next...
B00005B36H|5.0|I think that this album, is phenomenal, is great, is awesome, but is not as  good as tools best album to date: Aenima. Really Im a little disappointed with this album, the sound of the band, sometimes is not like tool was, however is good. But sometimes the sound, sounds great, the drum, the bass, sound out of this world, wrapping it to one, in a darkness and awesome atmosphere. Sincerely, I expected another masterpiece, like Aenima or Undertow, but it was not this way. Lateralus is a masterpiece in other sense, is not the best Tool album, but is a good work after 5 years. Good job guys!!!. The voice of Maynard is also incredible in every song, except, 2,4,12 and 13, Maynard achieves a voice, I believe, no other  singer can imitate. Lateralus is one of the best rock albums of 2001, possibly the best so far, Im also expected the new albums of System of a Down and Slipknot. Staind was another band that  impress myself pleasurably this year with Break the Cycle, that together with tool have the best rock albums this year. Im an insane Tool fan , and I think that this band is the prototype, of how a band should be! A lot of creativity in the sound and a hard personality makes tool a great band. I gave 5 stars to this album, although to my think it deserves 4, but Im always very demanding, so to give 4 stars to this cd, its as giving 10 stars to others cds that are maybe the best work to any other band. In conclusion, if you are a Tool fan, or if u like the heavy rock music, what are u waiting? Lets buy Lateralus now.
B000059HCI|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream tells the story of four people's addictions and how their lives spiral out of control.  This movie can be depressing at times, but captures the essence of how using drugs affects everyone around you.  With awesome camera tricks, chilling music, and superbe acting (Ellen Burstyn has never been better), Requiem for a Dream may not be a movie for everyone...but it certainly lays the cards out on the table.  If you enjoy this movie, I strongly suggest Aronofsky's PI.
B000002GK1|5.0|I have every Soundgarden album and this one is by far the best one.  I bought it the day it was released 10 years ago and to this day I can still say it rocks and it's relevant.  This album is heavy with lots of energy, great lyrics, contreversy, and killer songs.  The first 4 songs &quot;Rusty Cage,&quot; &quot;Outshined,&quot; &quot;Slaves and Bulldozers,&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; are the best beginning to any album EVER.  In fact, Jesus Christ Pose once had a video that was banned from MTV because it crossed the line.  Kim Thayil great licks, Chris Cornell's screaming lyrics, and Matt Cameron's dynamic drumming are at their best in these tunes.  The real shame is that the band went downhill after this album.  I think Cornell went soft on us.
B000002UJQ|5.0|this is truly one of the most dynamic, amazing, inspiring pieces of art of the twentieth century. full of emotion and energy, 'ok computer' is virtually flawless. every song is an integral part of the whole experience; even after countless listenings, i can never bring myself to skip a track. but at the same time, each song stands alone as an amazing piece of work.<br />from the opening guitar riff of 'airbag' to the eerie interlude of 'fitter happier,' from 'climbing up the walls'' obsessive nature to the detached lyrics of 'the tourist,' this album is a trip i never tire of taking.<br />'ok computer' will no doubt stand the test of time as one of the most influential and important events in modern music.
0553573403|5.0|I love fantasy books.  However, there is a dearth of quality in the genre.  If you feel the same way I do then take heart, the &quot;Ice and Fire&quot; series is the pot of gold at the end of the fantasy book rainbow.  The characters in this series are the most realistic and believable that I have ever read in the genre.  The series provokes true emotions because no character is safe.  Martin imperils all characters and has the guts to even kill some.  The good characters aren't so sugary sweet that they give you a tooth ache, no more than the evil characters are totally evil.  They both have good and bad traits.  What more, Martin gives perspective from both sides of the spectrum.  The series is the best I've read since Lord of the Rings, and if you are any kind of fantasy fan (and even if you're not) you WILL thoroughly enjoy this series.
B00001NFCY|2.0|But only from boy-bands.<br />Creed's overwrought, awkward, poorly crafted lyrics and uninspired melodies are in full force on this album.  Slickly processed, commercialized garbage is still garbage, folks.<br />Sure, they're popular.  So are American cheese, backyard wrestling, and heroin.  The fact that they're popular doesn't mean they have any intrinsic value.
0684869713|5.0|Although &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; contains a broader and more detailed look at Objectivism, this book benefits from not having such a burden placed upon it. Where &quot;Atlas&quot; gets bogged down with lengthy philosophical statements and never gets some of it's main characters developed (in some ways we still wonder &quot;who is John Galt?&quot;), this book is a more complete work.      Don't get me wrong, &quot;Atlas&quot; gives great insights and is possibly a more important philosophical work. The Fountainhead, however, is a completely woven literary tapestry and one that can fully be enjoyed on that level.
B00005BJC7|5.0|well.  the long awaited followup to kid a is here.  i have had the music on this album for a very long time now actaully.  over a month now ive been listening to the music.  now since the acutal cd finaly came into stores i bought it.  i looked at the regular cd...then i looked at the limited edition cd.  what a difference.  first ill talk about the music.  this is deff. not kid b as i keep reading in mags and hearing from friends that i let listen to the album before it came out in stores...it sounds similar...returns a little bit to the roots more...a little more gitar work, but still playing around w/ electronica in the main.  the concepts on kid a were i think better if you could pick up on the abstract thoughts that were placed in it...especailly the song kid a.  on this album there is less abstraction...more stragihtforwardness...BUT i think one of the great things of radiohead is that the songs mean different things to each person..everyone reads into the songs differentntly...great bands can do that in their music...they make you think for youself.  its a big part of radiohead.  one thing i do wanta point out is one track on this album 'morning bell/amnesiac' this follows the morning bell on kid a but w/ more despiration and strain... onto the booklet! dont get the origional..get this limited edition...it has very obscure artwork by stanley donwood and tchocky....the same guys as the kid a limited edition but better done i think....the quality of this book is 10 X beter than the kid a L.E. so i recomend you get this one and not judge the other.  it is constructed the same way as an old book is....just great. if you like radiohead..good chance you already bought it OR will very soon...if youliked kid a you'll probably like this...if your waiting for them to return to their roots of gitars...goodluck....you wont find it here..the next album...perhaps but in interviews he hints he wont return back to those good ol' days....enjoy this album and booklet...its worth the extra buck
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Having seen the film MOULIN ROUGE, I can easily say that this CD is the perfect soundtrack for the film.  The lush visuals of the film combine with the songs to create one of the most mesmerizing  works I have ever seen.  The music is an eclectic mix--from medleys of love songs to reinterpretations of everything from Marilyn Monroe to Madonna, and on top of that, a Hindi chant-infused tune that evokes the spectacle of the film.  Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan Macgregor do a commendable job, with Macgregor clearly emerging as a new singing talent--he's that good.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|You have to see the movie to really enjoy this cd. But after that, I only feel cheated that some of the songs from the movie were missing! The movie is amazing and you may laugh at some of the songs but they are so great. I recomend it to everyone I know.
6305878323|5.0|The movie is just a little bit too long. The problem is that it's impossible to identify a scene that can be cut to shorten the film; no matter which scene you picked, you'd be losing a great song or a fine visual or comedic or poignant moment if you cut it. So I guess it's about the right length, after all.
B00000ICD9|4.0|Firstly, it deserved it's Academy award for Visual Effects . The painted style of Robin William's \\"heaven\\" is breath-taking. You begin to appreciate this scene more after you go through the \\"extras\\" on the DVD where the SFX people explain the efforts that had gone into it.You marvel at the SFX of the movie but I wonder if one would still be amazed considering the glut of plotless SFX movies in these times. The overall picture quality of the DVD is good and the dolby digital 5.1 sound is excellent with good surround effects ! <br />Coming to the movie, it starts of with a breathtaking scene of Switzerland (the scene was actually shot in Montana) with it's lush surroundings and the crystal clear water with the breathtaking mountains in the backdrop. You can almost smell the flowers and one is inclined to take a deep-breath on experiencing the opening scene. <br />The movie then starts to crawl for the next 20 minutes or so. I guess the director was probably trying to build up the characters and their interactions but nonetheless, it crawls a bit. Once that's over the tempo starts to build up ! <br />And yea ... the alternate ending if of lessor audio/video quality but is pretty nice nonetheless. I like the part in which Cuba Gooding says \\"What do you mean by 'I' ? Is it your arm, your leg ... we are IN a house but we are NOT the house...\\" and implies that when we are finished with a house we move on and it's the same with our body and soul. The depiction of hell is pretty gloomy and at the same time leaves us confused as to what to make of the director's interpretation and depiction of the scenes.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This album has all the best features of the las tthree Radiohead albums plus more.  Less challenging than Kid A and just as cathcy as The Bends.  For all of you who liked any of the last three Radiohead albums this one is for you.  To sum it up, it sounds like whats good from Kid A mixed into a song structure similar to that of The Bends. This one is, in my opinion Radiohead's best and one of the best albums ever, if not the best.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I LOVED this movie! There were some things that could have been better (Baz's over use of quick visuals detracted from many of the scenes, making it difficult to fully enjoy the costumes and dancing, the &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; number was TOO long and I never quite bought the all consuming love between the movie's stars), but for a movie experience it was as close to perfect as you can get these days!<br />I felt swept away, loved the use of current classic pop mixed with original songs, the costuming and visuals would have made Tim Burton jealous and the supporting cast was excellent. It is definitely a film I will see again at the theater AND I will own on DVD. Beats most of the drivel out there (and if I ever lacked faith in the American public's taste, the fact that The Animal outdid Moulin Rouge at the box office this week proved that the majority in this country is a pathetic bunch of morons).<br />Happy moviegoing!!!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This is a movie unlike any you've probably ever seen.  The effects travel beyond realistic measures to the point where you're not quite sure what you're watching at first, but it's perfect.  Moulin Rouge is the type of movie where you find yourself suddenly laughing through tears.  It's got excellent comedy, passion, music, drama, and everything.  The very day after seeing it, I ran to purchase the soundtrack.  The movie also passes along a great message, which I won't mention as to not ruin it for anyone.  Go see it and enjoy!
B00005B36H|5.0|I've waited a pretty long time to give my review of Lateralus, as I wanted the album to settle in.  Personally, I think this is their greatest effort.  Although nima is a legendary piece, the band has surely progressed musically.  nima's songs was more vocal driven, while Lateralus is stronger musically.  If Maynard was highlighted in nima, Danny Carey (drummer) I believe is the highlight of this work.  Each song has an intricate drum line with much precision.  Some may say it has a tribal-feel to it.  He is definitely one of the greatest drummers of our time.  Maynard's vocals have progressed, as well.  The listener is introduced to new styles of vocals that he has never showed us before.  At times it is very much similar to his singing in A Perfect Circle.  He also uses vocal layering a bit.  The lyrics at (very few) times, leave something to be desired.  Justin Chancellor's bass lines are brought out greatly, and are mind-blowing.  Adam Jones is as always, amazing.  Although there are not many heavy-duty solos, etc., he creates beautiful atmosphere.  Every song is a masterpiece.  The short &quot;fillers,&quot; even play a significant role.  They are musical and serve as intros to songs, unlike many of the segues on nima.  The album, I believe, is intended to be listened to as a whole, as each song in someway relates to eachother, so it is difficult to say what my favorite songs are.  I am not going to describe every song, because I don't want to spoil it.  The album should not be utilized as background music, much concentration should be devoted to this work.  One of the greatest albums to come out of the past two centuries.  Most TOOL fans will be overly pleased.  If you are fond of thought-provoking, hard, yet melodic, rock, this is the album for you.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDEND!!!
B000059MEK|4.0|The album isn't much of a discovery, as the title probably suggests. Rather, it is a commercialized version of their previous album, &quot;Homework&quot;. One might even conclude &quot;they've become another Fatboy Slim, whose purpose of making records is to appeal to the new generation of pop audiences (TRLers, for example).<br />Overall, this album doesn't strike as innovative at all. It is most of the time unchallenging. Same old repetitive dance riffs we've been hearing since the beginning of dance music (see &quot;Cresendolls&quot;, and &quot;Superheroes&quot;). &quot;Too Long&quot; is an example of the same old cheesy lyrics in house music. The music on this track is quite good, though.<br />On the other hand, one might discover that they are not trying to be innovative at all. They want to make a pop record out of their own original style of French techno. In that case, tracks like &quot;One More Time&quot;, &quot;Digital Love&quot;, and &quot;Something About us&quot;, are pure pop magic. These are just about the only rewarding tracks in the case of artistry, along with the most interesting track of them all, &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot;. The rest are just plain simple.<br />It seems many reviewers here are taking this album too seriously.  It could be one of the best releases so far this year, but then again the year hasn't produced very many good releases thus far. Unless Daft Punk is absolutely your cup of tea, I don't recommend it too highly. I promise you will grow tired of it too quickly as I have.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This was my most anticipated movie that I've ever, uh...anticipated this much! I first saw the article in Vogue in December and since then had downloaded the trailer online dozens of times, read every possible article, got many pictures, bought the soundtrack...and on June 1st my waiting was rewarded! It was well worth all my time anxiously counting the days until it came out!!! True, as the critics say, it IS  a bit overdone in parts...but other than that, FABULOUS! Nicole was beautiful and stunning, and Ewan...well, he was beyond terrific! So, so, SO! handsome, and a great voice! Plus the chemistry they had, and the songs, and the great costumes, and the sets......a terrific movie. There were even very funny parts in it, which I wasn't expecting (but still, a plus!) See it! Again and again and again! You won't regret it. (Even if it's just to see Ewan.) :D
B00005B4GU|4.0|I once wrote a review of this album condemning it as containing too much electronica and... um... oddballism? It wasn't until I took a break from listening to it and then returned a few months later that I realized how truly fresh this album is.<br />The CD is not perfect for my tastes. Some of it Radiohead could have done without and received much raver reviews. But for some reason I don't think that's what they really want any way. All in all, I have enjoyed &quot;Amnesiac&quot; more than alot of other music I listen to. I guess this sort of music requires an acquired taste, just as classical music does.<br />Much of the CD isn't exactly a pleasure to listen to, but there's a reason for it. Take for instance &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot;. The majority of it is dark and inhibiting; the music never really goes anywhere. Talk of cutting the kids in half and others horrors plague the lyrics. Then there is a quiet outcry of &quot;release me&quot;. A vision of hope almost appears before it is crushed by more darkness. Near the end of the track it returns. But there is where it all fades away in an odd manner, not a hint as to how the story ends. Almost all of the songs are suffocated in despair.<br />It seems like in some of the tracks Thom just takes popular American catch-phrases and makes them seem sarcastic. On some songs the messages are cryptic (&quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot;), while others (&quot;We are the dollars and cents.&quot;) are rather obvious.<br />If you didn't like &quot;Kid A&quot; at all you probably won't like this. If you didn't like &quot;Ok Computer&quot; (yeah, right) you won't like this. Others have said it before. &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is the missing link between the old and the... &quot;new&quot;? Who knows?
B00003CXP1|5.0|The emotional impact of this film solely relies on how true these characters are conveyed (from the actors' and director's point of view). The rated version does take away just a little from the director's vision but the acting will always create a disturbing, foreboding feeling. Yes, the DVD version is the unrated version. No, there is not a great difference between the R and Un-Rated versions. I just like the DVD better because of the image quality and (most notably) the sound. When Sara starts to hallucinate that the fridge is alive the sound coming from the fridge slowly creeps in front and behind you until the two sounds crash together to create a claustrophobic sting.<br />The DVD has a Kaufman-esque intro where Tappy Tibbons is interviewing people for his JUICE product and it makes your TV look like it has a static signal(my friend actually thought my VEGA was messed up). The elevator music translation of the summer theme for the chapter index is hilarious. So is the test signal screen for the visual setup. The deleted scenes are just crazy split screens. I believe the 6 split screen involving the faces of Harry, Marion, and Tyrone while the three other splits fixiate on their &quot;fixes&quot; was the most effective. <br />DVD is just ten times better for all the little humurous touches to lighten the feel for those who have already seen it. It also creates a misconception for those who haven't which is totally cool. BUY THE DAMN DVD! But don't be ashamed if you have the edited version because you still get the same atmosphere and message.
B00005B36H|5.0|Many albums, and other works of art, have been referred to by some fan or reviewer as &quot;spiritual odysseys,&quot; and Lateralus is one of the relatively few &quot;rock&quot; albums that really does come across that way--oh, and by the way, it is also an actual ALBUM, not just a collection of three or four marketable songs padded by a bunch of &quot;filler.&quot; Aenima is one of my favorite albums, but I admit that after the first several things I had heard and read about Lateralus, I approached it with a bit of skepticism. Had Tool created an album that &quot;does too much&quot; to try and equal the earlier effort? Had they ventured into the dangerous territory of &quot;eclecticism?&quot; I should've known by how different their earlier efforts were, that Tool's not that kind of band. By the way, while one could definitely say that this album is a &quot;work of art,&quot; that term sometimes evokes an image of something gathering dust, and this album is something to be lived with and experienced often, not just left on a shelf. As far as &quot;genres&quot; go, this album has elements of different genres in it, including metal, but please don't call it &quot;art metal&quot;--and definitely don't call it &quot;Nu-Metal!&quot;--terms such as these do this work a disservice.<br />After a few careful listenings, those who are familiar with Aenima will note a couple of obvious differences: 1) The production is much clearer than on Aenima. One of the things I loved about Aenima was the sludgy guitar sound, but additional clarity is needed to accomodate the added intricacy of Lateralus. 2) When one listens to the lyrics (and the band advises listeners to just listen to this album for awhile before hunting down the lyrics), one notices, first of all, that there are less of them, but it also becomes apparent that they are not quite as angry and misanthropic. Yes, there are those jarring moments of lashing out at the mindlessness of their fellow humans (&quot;The Grudge&quot; and &quot;Ticks and Leeches,&quot; for example) to which Tool fans have become accustomed, but there is an almost &quot;Zen current&quot; to much of the lyrics and the music. This transformation seems to represent a moving beyond the anger that they were trying to come to terms with on Aenima. The &quot;third eye&quot; that they were struggling to pry open at the end of Aenima has begun to open.<br />You see a lot of comments in other reviews about the &quot;odd interludes&quot; and &quot;long songs.&quot; Yes, there are interludes, but they feel more like preludes to the longer &quot;songs&quot; than just the weird ambient &quot;snips&quot; on Aenima. As far as the length of the &quot;songs&quot; goes, it may be more informative to look at the tracks on this album as &quot;works&quot; within a cohesive whole than as a collection of &quot;songs.&quot; If you want this album to just be a collection of songs, you may be predisposed not to like it. <br />The riffs on Lateralus are often more complex than on Aenima-but also good, which isn't always synonomous with &quot;complex;&quot; the guitar sound is cleaner, and there are some great acoustic passages, too; the drumming continues to be amazing, with some incredible rhythms; and MJK continues to be one of the most amazing rock vocalists, singing more quietly and audibly in places, but not without the occasional angry outburst. The album definitely has more of a range of dynamics than Aenima.<br />It's not difficult to see this album as falling somewhat neatly into two halves, the first half ending with &quot;Parabola&quot; which, to me, carries the album's core message in it's final line:<br />&quot;This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality. Embrace this moment. Remember, we are eternal. All this pain is an illusion.&quot;<br />&quot;The Grudge&quot; is an arresting album opener with some great metallic riffs and some of Danny Carey's most amazing drumming. &quot;Schism&quot; would not have been my choice for a first &quot;single&quot; from this album (I would've chosen &quot;The Grudge,&quot; &quot;Ticks and Leeches,&quot; or even, &quot;The Patient,&quot; first). It's not a bad song, but it works better within the context of the album. When I listen to it on it's own, I can't get past the fact that it sounds like a not-quite-as-good take on &quot;46&amp;2,&quot; which is my favorite Tool song. &quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot;--the former serving partly as a quiet, hypnotic, chant-like intro to the more jarring, metallic latter--is one of the album's very finest moments, along with the luminously dark, &quot;Reflection,&quot; which includes the hauntingly soulful call of a sarangi (sort of the Indian equivalent of the cello) to go with its soulful lyrics and &quot;tribal&quot; rhtyhms. As another reviewer pointed out, &quot;Ticks and Leeches,&quot; appears to be the entry &quot;for the metal heads&quot; (one of which I often consider myself, by the way) with some grinding riffs and MJK's most brutal, almost death metal, vocals (ala &quot;Hooker...&quot; or &quot;Enema&quot; on the prior album); and one of the album's most jarring moments after the track's quiet middle section. These are just some of the highlights. One of the many things I love about Tool is their use of &quot;exotic melodies,&quot; i.e. ancient/eastern modes, and this album has plenty of those.<br />Taken as a whole, this is a great album with few &quot;weak links.&quot; If you have an unusually short attention span or don't like being jarred back into reality, you might not like this album, but it is a work that definitely rewards some attentive listening. The title, and theme, of track 3, &quot;The Patient&quot; reminds us what the most important human virtue is, and also what is required for fully appreciating this album:  PATIENCE.
B00005BJC7|5.0|Very original.  They incorporate other types of music like Aphex Twin and Neu but it all mixes into their own original style.  I liked &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; because it starts out real gentle and simple.  Then this crazy drum beat comes in and it seems to not make any sense.  The beats are almost random.  Eventually, you get used to it and you realize the beat is perfect...just a little complex.  I like &quot;I might be wrong&quot; also with the slide sounding guitar and Thom's vocals sound like they are in surf tone...slight reverb with some chorus and tremolo it seemed.  Really cool.  All the other songs are just as good.  &quot;Knives out&quot; reminds you of a hint of &quot;Paranoid android&quot; and Jonnys guitar work here is beautiful.  It's like an exploration in sound textures and song structure thats alien to the mainstream of today.  If anything, it may open your musical horizon.  You should get it!  This seems like Radiohead has found their nitch(KID A/AMNESIAC/OKCOMPUTER) and they are sticking to it.  Real fans of Radiohead and the progression of music in general will love it.   Everyone else may want to put on their Sketchers go listen to Coldplay or Travis at the coffee or garden shop nearest you.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is a totally unique, underrated movie.  I rate it one of my personal favorites, especially the dvd version which comes with so many special features.<br />The movie itself is so incredible due to the plotline, which has you moving in one direction and then throws you such a curve that you'll be blown away.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are incredible opposite each other, complimenting each other's different characters.  Norton portrays a bored man living a mundane, routine life that he desperately needs to escape.  Pitt's character provides Norton with that escape, but you'll never guess the way the movie will go once the action starts building.  It'll catch you when you're not looking.<br />Fight Club is one of those movies that you'll need to watch again just to go catch some of the little things you might have missed the first time and help you enjoy the depth of the movie's plot.  With some dark humor thrown into the mix and plenty of action, I think Fight Club is a real winner.  It also features one of the best fight sequences in movie history.
B00004T9UF|3.0|You gotta love it. . .Eminem actually rhymes about things that are important in today's society. The lyrics are unbelievable, and better yet, undertandable.  Good Cd, but it could use some more A-class songs.
B00000K19E|5.0|The extra &quot;stuff&quot; on this DVD make it a must have.  The red pill &quot;What is the Concept&quot; is my favorite.  Follow the white rabbit is a great feature.
B00004T9UF|3.0|You gotta love it. . .Eminem actually rhymes about things that are important in today's society. The lyrics seem thought out and well placed.  Better yet, I was able to actually understand what he was saying when he rapped.  The message came across very clearly.  Only a couple bad points.  All in all it's a good Cd, but it could use some more A-class songs.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|This film is overwhelming, to say the least.  Don't go looking for any type of deep story.  He comes out and says it right at the beginning.  This is a story about love.  Plain and simple.  And the story is simple.  But how fun it is to watch it!<br />The first half of the film is incredibly overwhelming, visually.  And while you can appreciate Luhrman's success in conveying all the rich sensations found at the Moulin Rouge, I found myself getting literally dizzy trying to process it all.  And I was quite pleased when the visual pace slowed down a bit at the half-way mark so that I could more fully enjoy the story.  Yes, film fans, I'm sure this is supposed to be part of the experience, but it was still a welcome arrival to slow things down.<br />The music is a blast. Go ahead and giggle with everyone else when you suddenly recognize a song being used in a new way.  It's magical.  I can't wait for Ewan McGregor to release an album.  He's great in this!  And Nicole Kidman gives a solid, if not spectacular performance.<br />Overall, a fun ride that leaves you more than a little startled and wrung-out at the end.  But I'm still thinking about it several days later.
B00000JHAU|5.0|The Scottish group Belle &amp; Sebastian has delivered an impressive amount of high quality music in the decade or so that they've been around, and most people will argue that IF YOU'RE FEELING SINISTER is their best work to date. The album has all that you'd expect from a Belle &amp; Sebastian CD. This means that you're in for slow paced rock tunes that basically sounds like Travis on novocain. On the surface Belle &amp; Sebastian comes off as quite innocent, but listen closer and you'll hear that their lyrics are sad and depressing, yet at the same time pervaded by an uplifting (though quite black) sense of humour. My favourite songs on this CD are GET ME AWAY FROM HERE I'M DYING, THE FOX IN THE SNOW, ME AND THE MAJOR, and the title track, IF YOU'RE FEELING SINISTER. Great music! As long as your cup of tea isn't electronical bands or mainstream music like All Saint, but rather bands like Travis, Radiohead and Coldplay, then I'm sure you'll get a kick out of this CD.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I went into the cinema expecting to be amazed with the costumes and scenery, in awe of the singing, and enthralled in the story. Basically I went into Moulin Rouge with unreachable expectations.<br />I wasn't disappointed!<br />The movie was unlike anything I've ever seen. The camera angles, and difficult shots are at times dizzying and overwhelming, but in the fantasy world that Baz Lurhmann has created it all works. The music is beautiful and inspiring and funny all at the same time. <br />Nicole doesn't have the most powerful or experienced voice, but it only adds to the poignancy of her character. I found that she fit the part far better than I expected. Her rendition of &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; was especially nice. <br />As for Ewan, he can *really* sing! His voice was clear and powerful, and the Elephant love melody duet was probably one of my favourite sequences. That last scene (*sniffs)...Wow.<br />I laughed (never I thought I'd enjoy Madonna's &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; quite so much!) and I cried, and I left the theatre shaking. I haven't felt that way since...I've never felt that way. I sincerly hope this film does well, because it is so unique and beautiful and touching.<br />I heartily recommend Moulin Rouge to everyone. It's truly a movie lover's movie. It's a movie, and you never once forget it. It's flashy and loud and fake. But the fact that it just doesn't make sense is what makes it make sense. It's a movie and it's art at the same time.<br />Stop reading already, and go see Moulin Rouge!<br />&quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.&quot;
0060934913|2.0|This book had gotten good press and I am interested in the subject, but I had seen the author on television and didn't like him much, so I waited for the paperback. I'm really glad I didn't buy the hardcover. What a disappointment! And for those reviewers who say anyone who doesn't like the book is ignorant of the restaurant business -- No, thank you very much for telling me what I know and think (and what would I like for breakfast today, hmm?) -- perhaps we JUST DON'T LIKE THE BOOK!<br /><br />The stories and language are self-consciously profane, and the writing is generally without merit.  The author is by turns arrogant and whining.  The author despises his customers, calling them (at best) rubes, while all of his employers are imbeciles and all of his employees and co-workers are criminals, drug addicts and degenerates.  Mr. Bourdain is a talented writer.  He can make characters come to life.  But he is a remarkably unsympathetic narrator, and a disorganized thinker: the chapters jump from topic to topic sometimes without any reasoning at all; in the beginning the author tells us that no one should enter the restaurant business, but then he gives a lot of advice on how to enter the restaurant business; he says that everyone in the restaurant business is a loser of one kind or another, but then has a chapter about a couple of exceptionally good chefs.  There is an interesting chapter at the end about a trip the author took to Japan, and a few good pages about tools and ingredients a serious amateur chef might want, but these should have been articles, not a book. There is little organization and no cohesion, and the book could have used a good editor.  *That* is why I do not like this book.  I wanted to like the book.  I just didn't.
B00005B4GU|5.0|With Amnesiac being Radiohead's second release this year, it is hard to believe that this is the same band that released 'Pablo Honey' (their first album).  This along with Kid A are probably in the top 5 cd's I have purchased this year.  The only weak point of this album, is that Trans-Atlantic Drawl was left off of the album.  This is available on the Pyramid Song single though.  MUST BUY!
B000059R8Y|5.0|I'm almost 28 and I've known about Eric Clapton for a long time but never had given his music a chance.  My brother introduced his music to me. I knew he came out with a new album and would be coming to Indianapolis to promote his new album, Reptile.  So, I bought it and gave it a chance.  In fact, for my brother's graduation present I took him to see an Eric Clapton Concert this past weekend.  I was blown away.  I'm a new fan of his and will be collecting some of his old material.  From that concert alone, I'm beginning to appreciate his music and why he's admired by so many.  This is definitely a tour you don't want to miss and an album to appreciate.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|.... I read that review before I purchased the disk, and I am glad I did, because, just like the time I bought Mr. Wainwrights first disk, I was once again overwhelmed. His sophomore album overachieves in my book. I have only listened to it 4 times, compared to maybe 4000 times, of the first disk, but some things stand out...I think the arrangements are intelligent and loose, the melodies are everywhere, and I already have a place in my heart for about 8 or 9 of the songs.  I have a three year old daughter who literally grew up with the first disk. Today, in the car, right out of the record shop, we ripped open the disk, popped it in the player, and...singin'along the first time,Grace and I both knew, we had a soundtrack for another couple years... .... I believe this album will gain MORE fans than the first. Listen to it again, ok? Wanna bet?
B00004Y7SF|4.0|Excellent work!!!Every track sounded like she had put once of her heart into it.  Great!
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is their best CD yet.  Radiohead have done even better than Kid A.  I've listened to it twice since I bought it this afternoon.  If you buy one cd this year, buy this one.  We'll never hear this stuff on the radio.
B00005BL2A|2.0|This album sounds too much like Martin Gore's Counterfeit E.P. Too slow and too experimental.I thought Ultra was excellent - this album, while aspiring for lofty heights with it's slick production, divebombs and explodes. I consider myself a true DM fan, so I will give it 2 stars.
B000059MEK|2.0|I regret buying this album! A friend of mine who really likes Air, Sigur Ros, and Godspeed You Black Emperor! (as do I) recommended this album to me. I was excited when I was walking through a department store and saw Discovery in the music section. I thought I'd never find music I like in a department store!! So I bought the album without reservation. When I listened to it, I was befuddled by the first track, which reminded me of that song 'Blue' by the one hit wonder Eiffel something-or-other.  This music had no soul. I kept listening and waiting for something good. Daft Punk continuously draws from music styles of the past without breaking new ground or pushing the envelope.  I am astounded that this album has so many good reviews!  It is not real techno, not even house which is the cheesiest form of techno.  It is mindless beats interspersed with trite lyrics and musically explores nothing.  I can't believe people compare Daft Punk to Air!  Just because two bands are from the same country, doesn't mean they are similar.  Air is much more chill, refined, and interesting.  If you are looking for good techno or just good music, don't buy this album.  If you like hollow music with shallow lyrics that makes you bob your head, you'll probably like Discovery. I give it a two because there is one track near the middle of the album that I can stomach, otherwise it's doomed for musical obscurity.
B00000IPAX|1.0|Blink 182 proves that, once again, they have nothing to say. Their lyrics are empty - no meaning, nothing more than some talentless teenagers trying to say stuff that will sound &quot;cool&quot; to an audience of teenage boys, trying to get their record to sell. Unfortunately, this method, as proven by others such as Eminem and Kid Rock, always works. Just look at the cover of the CD. Is this a band that relies on its musical talent, or its shock value? In addition to Blink 182's inability to convey any worthwhile method with their words, their music also fails to stray from the norm. Every song sounds exactly the same. Their drummer knows only one rhythm (or at least uses only one) - his incessent 1-2-1-2-1-2. This CD left my asking &quot;why,&quot; as in &quot;why would anyone want to listen to this?&quot;
B00004WGBE|5.0|Gee, this movie was a huge delight!  I love,love,love it!  So glad, I bought it!  I mainly bought it to see James Purefoy, but even if he had not been  in this film, I would have loved it.  Fitzgerald and Stephens were tremendous.  Graves was an alcoholic worm in the most convincing way-creepy indeed.   Purefoy was grand as the supportive older brother and very well dressed as Mr. Lawrence, but not enough screen time and no romantic interest for him-more of a background role than I would have liked for him.  However, again, this film was the best and in many ways upstages Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights.  Ironic that Charlotte Bronte did not appreciate this story by her little sister, Anne.  I think the story has a positive female heroine and a nice ending.  In some ways Anne Bronte's story is almost Austenian in its quality.  Buy this movie!
B000002JSH|1.0|I can't believe the great reviews this album received, stating that it's &quot;great rock&quot;, &quot;great hard rock&quot;, whatever. oooh!! Gimme me a break !! This band ( at least in this CD) sounds not like rock at all, it's more inclined towards country music !! And the lyrics ...! God !! They are awful, totally cheesy, always talking about love, girls, heartbreaks, and on and on... Sad !! Of course there is great quality in the musicians, but to say this is a landmark in rock... it's a lie.

B000002UCN|1.0|Release a George Harrison compilation and call it &quot;BEST OF GEORGE HARRISON&quot;, when half of it contains BEATLE songs is a total absurd, which shows clearly the unique intention of earning money. What a shame.
B00005K9QP|5.0|Few albums have had greater impact than the landmark John Mayall With Eric Clapton &#34;Blues Breakers.&#34; Released by the Decca label in Britain on 22 July 1966, literally days after Clapton quit the Bluesbreakers and just a week before Cream's debut, it went all the way to #6: no mean feat since Mayall's band had never had a hit single. This may have been a first in Britain.  Of course, this is the album that set the blues and guitar worlds aflame and established Eric Clapton's name worldwide as the most passionate of musical interpreters. If you haven't yet heard &#34;Beano&#34; (as the album is affectionately known, because Clapton is pictured reading &#34;The Beano&#34; comic book on its cover), then you ain't heard nuthin' yet!  From the album's first notes, you realize that you're in guitar heaven, as &#34;Slowhand&#34; shows us the way electric guitar can and should be played. Clapton's virtuoso playing is white-hot throughout. Playing with maturity beyond his then-21 years, the young guitarist was so influential that Gibson eventually reissued the (out-of-production-since-1960) Les Paul model guitar, which Clapton then played.  John Mayall's Bluesbreakers served--and his current band still serves today--as a finishing school for great musicians and sidemen (Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor, John McVie, Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar, Mick Fleetwood, Walter Trout, Coco Montoya and others). Mayall's proselytizing the blues (he's 82 years old!), his songwriting skills and his other musical talents should not be ignored nor taken lightly.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Less than a year after the release of Kid A, Radiohead follows up with Amnesiac.  The album was recorded at the same time as Kid A and while it is definitely more accessible, the album is hardly conventional.  Most of the songs don't have the multi-layered, electronic sounds of Kid A, but they still feature intricate soundscapes.  &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; is a tremendous song and &quot;You &amp; Whose Army?&quot; is equally good.  &quot;Knives Out&quot; is a song that imitators like Coldplay would kill for.  &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Door&quot; continues in the experimental vein and &quot;Dollars &amp; Cents&quot; has some great guitar work.  Amnesiac continues to show why Radiohead is one of the most interesting and intriguing bands in rock music.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Radiohead's second album in less than year isn't really a 'new' album. Think of the album they released last year, Kid A, as a double LP, only the 2nd disc was withheld from the music buying public for eight long months. That should give you an idea of what 'Amnesiac' sounds like. The songs are hard to like: distorted vocals buried beneath bass-heavy beats, the lack of guitars on most of the tracks (again) and the sad realisation that Radiohead are not the same. A great track here is 'The Pyramid Song', a plaintive piano ballad, replete with chest-swelling strings. Thom Yorke sings about swimming with 'black-eyed angels' while seeing 'astrocars'. If you have seen the music video it makes a little more sense. The Pyramid Song and 'Knives Out' are the only obvious choices for singles. That should tell you about the rest of the songs on the album.<br />Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors in my very humble opinion, is an absolute shocker. If you can call it a song, it features little more than a bass loop and some sort of robot muttering something barely intelligible about barn doors and sliding doors. Maybe I'll grow to like this one, as I did with 'Kid A' (the song). However such a track sits uncomfortably with more conventional ones like Knives Out or even the jazz-influenced 'Life In A Glasshouse'. The music just seems to have been slapped together to create some semblance of an album. However the results of this experimentation haven't been all bad. There's an incredible bit of music called 'Like Spinning Plates' where Thom Yorke's vocal has been reversed and sounds  as though he's speaking another language and slurring his words, helped along by a ominious and gloomy organ.<br />If you aren't yet a Radiohead fan 'Amnesiac' will probably decide whether you will be. I think I might be stuck with Radiohead for life, but I won't lie. Some of the lustre is wearing off. Regardless of what some will say, 'Amnesiac' really IS 'Kid B'. The two albums complement one another but something still isn't right. This is music that stimulates the mind, where as 'The Bends' and 'Ok Computer' were albums that reached into your soul and gave you a good shaking up. 'Amnesiac' does this to a degree, just not often enough.
B00004XONN|5.0|On their previous release, OK Computer, Radiohead created a dense sonic landscape.  With Kid A, they have created an even darker, deeper and denser sound that challenges you at every twist and turn.  The album's sound consists of swirling electronic noises layered on top of one another with the band underneath it all.  Thom Yorke's vocals are distorted throughout most of the album and when they aren't, they're buried deep into the mix and it sounds like he's under water.  This may sound like a bad thing, but it makes the album all the more interesting.  The sounds bleed into one another with little distinction.  Songs like &quot;Morning Bell&quot;, &quot;Treefingers&quot;, &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; and &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; require repeated listens to completely listen to all the complexities.  &quot;Optimistic&quot; is the most radio friendly song from the album, but the best is &quot;The National Anthem&quot; with it pulsating and pounding beats, it is a brilliant track.  Kid A is an excellent album and a great listen.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This album is a natural progression from Kid A.  The sound of this disc is much tighter and dark.  Curl up into a ball and rock back and forth in the corner...that is what you want to do when you listen to this album.  If you like the rest of Radiohead's crazy stuff...starting with OK Computer and moving forward you should buy this album.  It takes their music to a new level with the further addition of horns and string sections as well as electronic beats that will knock your socks off!!
B00003CXP1|5.0|This movie is fabulous and it is undoubtly one of the finest works of 2000. Many reviewers have already given positive comments to this masterpiece, so I won't say more about it.<br><br>SPOILERS WARNING SPOILERS WARNING<br><br>What I want to say is about the censorship thing. There is absolutely no need for you to go so mad about it, because the scenes deleted do not have so much to do with the story itself. Just like \\"Eyes Wide Shut,\\" MPAA was totally infuriated by the pornographic sex scenes, so the filmmakers simply \\"removed\\" or \\"didn't show\\" what Jennifer Connelly was doing in the last few minutes of the film. Those sences are not THAT exotic or outrageous since there are tons of similar stuff on the internet. In other words, just go to the \\"right\\" websites if you are really fussy about those deleted scenes. Believe me, they make no difference except satisfying your untamed curiosity.<br><br>After all, nobody would actually buy the edited version, because there are !no extra features on the disc! I really don't see the point why they treated the disc this way, as if the disc was warning, \\"Look, this version is censored and without special features, so do not buy me!\\" <br><br>To sum up, dear customers, you will NOT be cheated.
B000002H70|5.0|so i havent been a cure fan for that long but now i am obsessed with them all because of this lushly written epic beauty of a cd. it first starts out with wind chimes striking their chords to bring in &quot;plainsong&quot; and synthetic orchestra starts to hum and it foils into robert smiths smooth mellow piercing english vocals. you are blanketed by this sound of something so amazing. and right away you know this is probably one of the best things you have ever heard. this musical journey leads into such songs and the ballad  hopeless poetry like to the song &quot;pictures of you&quot;  on to that reaches &quot;closedown&quot; a honest lonesome lyricly at the best. the journey takes its tops and turns to reach the ballad honest painful lyrics of my fave cure song &quot;untitled&quot; with a pipe oregan beginning leads into tricky drum line and his soulful sad voice captures you and after you finished it all you suddenly realize wow. that was amazing it never lets down and always keeps you mezmorized i recomend to cure and non cure fans alike
B00003CXPD|1.0|This movie was one of the most awful movies I've ever seen.  The dialogue was boring, the premise was unbelievable, and I had to work very hard not to fall asleep by the end.  Predictable plot takes you nowhere.  Please, don't bother.
B000001DTM|5.0|My friend and I were talking today about U2 and how everyone credited Nirvana with the rise in popularity of alternative music. No doubt Nirvana was influential, and &quot;Achtung&quot; isn't grunge, but if memory serves me correctly, this was one of the first, if not the first, records to bust so-called &quot;alternative&quot; music wide open. Whether that is or isn't so, this album hits as hard today as it did ten years ago. I just saw them in concert and &quot;The Fly&quot; was without a doubt one of their greatest live songs. Simply put, there is not a bad song on this album. It's almost like a concept album without being a concept album. If you look at the difference between this and &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; or &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; the sound is so drastically different - to alter your sound like that (and to have the courage to do so when you're already one of the most popular bands in the world) is both genuinely impressive and admirable. Bono recently said that the band was &quot;reapplying for the job of greatest rock band in the world.&quot; I would only say that they needn't reapply. They never lost the job.
6304806426|4.0|This film is certainly vulnerable to attacks on its length and pace; but if you sit back and accept that it's not &quot;Top Gun&quot; or &quot;Die Hard&quot; (which do have their own merits), you'll be treated to a rich, complex, mature story with fine, fine performances by Fiennes, Binoche and Dafoe. (Kristen Scott Thomas is good, but it seemed to me that much of the quality of her performance was simply indebted to her &quot;classic&quot; loveliness.)<br />The desert cinematography is stark, sweeping and captivating, while the lush, exotic score subtlely heightens each scene. As for the pace, while the beginning does plod a bit and demands careful attention to the dialogue for plot-building details, the ascent to the climax has more than its share of engaging moments. And speaking of . . . yes, the climax is undoubtedly vulnerable to the &quot;tear-jerker&quot; label. The difference here, though, is that it does not appear contrived or cliched; and it shouldn't, since the plot lays the groundwork for it well and since, in all honesty, while the ending is foreshadowed, it was one of the very few that has surprised and haunted me.<br />In sum, like its characters, TEP is imperfect (e.g., like the Bridges of Madison County--but not to that extent--it rhapsodizes adultery); but it also shows elegantly and powerfully that the human condition, made brittle and vulnerable by our conflicts and unchecked desires, is at once breathtakingly beautiful and heart-wrenchingly sad. Well done and well worth watching (more than once).
B00000DFSK|5.0|There isn't that much to say about this disc...take the greatest band in the world...take them at the most creative part of their lives...take (arguably) the greatest songs they produced...you have an unforgettable collection.<br />I, too, like the full length CDs better, but the way the songs are arranged keep the album fluid and close to what a full-length, non-greatest hits CD would sound like.
B00005B4GU|4.0|'Amnesiac' is an album whos music returns to the more conventional and familiar melodies and rhythms found on earlier Radiohead albums, such as 'OK Computer'. But in no way is 'Amnesiac' comparable to 'OK Computer'; each Radiohead album seems to take on a personality of its own, and that is one of the main reasons that they remain so popular. There are some great songs on this album that only require a single listen to fully appreciate: 'Pyramid Song' (one of my favorite Radiohead recordings), 'I Might Be Wrong', 'Life in a Glasshouse' all are easy listens. Other songs, such as 'You and Whose Army?', 'Knives Out' and 'Dollars and Cents' require a couple of listenings to appreciate the combination of Thom Yorke's voice and the music that goes along with it. The song 'Morning Bell' appeared on 'Kid A', and I like this version better than the 'Kid A' version. However, one song that really annoyed me was 'Pulk/Pull Revolving Door'. The lyrics aren't discernable, and the constant bass is very aggravating. Radiohead, to me anyway, has a history of doing this ('Fitter Happier' on OK Computer and track #2 [can't think of the name right now] on Kid A). But all in all Amnesiac is a solid effort put forth by Radiohead, and one last note: the booklet and liner notes contain some pretty cool stuff...check it out.
B00003CX8I|5.0|What else can I say? Hollywood finally got something right. The changes from the comics are minimal, but give the movie a little flair. The plot was great, the action scenes were unbelievable, and the entire concept behind the movie was just excellent. But the characters were the best part of the movie. Development of and interaction between the characters separate X-Men from many lesser, so-called &quot;films&quot;. I only hope that the sequels will build upon the original's success and make this series one that people will talk about in years to come.
B00005K9QP|5.0|This album is essential for any blues fan. Specially the ones who like Eric Clapton, he is in full form all over this album, showing his unique technique and great playing. Dont miss it!
B00004Z459|5.0|Where do I start.From the intensity of &quot;One Step Closer&quot; to the sweet beats of &quot;A Cure For The Itch&quot;.THIS IS THE BEST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!!If i could only listen to one CD for the REST OF MY LIFE this would be it.I guarantee you WILL NOT regret buying it.I LOVE all the songs.I dont know how they did it but this is one of the best CD'S in THE WORLD!!!!!BUY IT NOWWWWWWWWW!!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead's follow-up to the love-it-or-hate-it &quot;Kid A&quot; is  a little less atonal, but its far and away the most outwardly spooky of Radiohead's albums.  Previous albums had their share of modern existential terror and paranoia...this one takes it and bludgeons you with it about the head. <br />Spare me the &quot;Kid B&quot; please, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is not quite as far out as &quot;Kid A.&quot;  It features more of Johnny Greenwood's guitar finesse and less computer bleeps.  There are still remnants of &quot;Kid A&quot; here as witnessed in &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; and &quot;Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box.&quot;  But that's not such a bad thing...don't let it stop you. That also does not mean that this is not an experimental album.  It is!  You can almost hear the motion and the tenuous balance in &quot;Like Spinning Plates.&quot;  <br />It's almost hard to believe that these songs came from the same sessions as &quot;Kid A,&quot; since they fit together so well.  I was worried that &quot;Amnesiac&quot; would be a group of left-over songs simply thrown together.  This album stands firmly on its own.<br />From the spooky cannibalistic imagery of &quot;Knives Out&quot; to the sublime dirge of &quot;Life in a Glass House.&quot; This album is the creepiest of Radiohead's albums yet,  and it sends shivers of terror up my spine.  It is also more accessible for new fans and old fans who may not have been ready for its predecessor.
B00004Z459|5.0|let me begin by saying that if i could give it 1000 stars i would.the fact that they can even have such an amamzing CD without feeling the need to swear is SCWEET!One person said that the bass is lacking,they have no bass!I think that is awesome that they can have such schweet music without a bass.My favorite song is 'Papercut'....
B000002GYI|5.0|Kraftwerk make it sound so effortless. Beats, sounds, bleeps, klings and klangs flow throughout this masterpiece of minimalism. Computer World is a seemless journey through futurism, Dusseldorf style. But unlike most futurists, the predictions were correct.<br />But that doesn't matter, all that counts is that this album is perhaps the closest Kraftwerk ever came to perfection. Computer World is the essence of Kraftwerk. If you don't like this album, you don't like Kraftwerk. And if you haven't got a place in your heart for Kraftwerk then you know nothing about music and less about genius.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Another great album from one of the greatest bands.<br />I'm extremely fussy when it comes to music.  I hate all forms of disposable music, especially homogenized music, like neo-country, hip-hop, and many forms of rap.<br />As a general rule, I prefer `old' music - the Who, Beatles, Kinks, Steely Dan, old U2, Talking Heads, Neil Young, etc...<br />Much of the new music doesn't grab me, or compel me emotionally.  It feels so trite and reaching.<br />Radiohead, for the last three albums especially, have been quite the exception.  Amnesiac continues this legacy, with its soaring `Pyramid Song' (which, for once in a long time (on both Pyramid and Dollars and Cents), actually uses strings as an integral part of the music, and not merely dressing, like in so many tired \\"adult alternative\\" rock songs), the propulsive opener (I'm too lazy to type it out :) ), the  astonishing Dixie funeral march \\"Life in a glass house\\", the shimmering \\"Knives out\\" and the goading \\"You and whose Army\\".<br />If you've heard Kid A, you'll most certainly find this album to be another piece of the puzzle.  It fits in with it perfectly, just as well as it stands on its own.<br />Definitely the best album so far this year.
0805062971|5.0|I read the book after watching the movie and was impressed by how closely it followed the book.  All of the changes they made were for the better (how many times does that happen!).<br />I keep trying to tell me friends to see this movie, and almost always they say something like, &quot;my wife/girlfriend doesn't want to see it&quot;.  I understand that based on the previews in the theatres, but I think this is sort of like not seeing &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; because it is a &quot;chick movie&quot;.  This is a really good movie despite what you might think it is about.<br />Okay, so what is it about.  Uh, well, male angst-- but not the way you might think.  It isn't about beating each other up as much as showing what's beneath the kahki and polo-shirt costumes and the Ikea cocoons of urban life.  Women always complain about not understanding men, see this and you get a glimpse.  We're not all Tyler Durdens, but we all understand him.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Fight Club is the type of film that provokes two types of reactions, the first one being that you have just enjoyed the last two hours immensely, and the second being that underneath the facade of seemingly mindless amd gratuitous violence, there lies a luminiscent core which ultimately constitutes a witty and incisive satirical of modern life. <br />Critics were extremely divided over this one. The majority of them dismissed the film as a thoughtless and manipulative exercise in subjecting the audience to a deluge of obscenities and a heavy but pointless visceral punch in the face.<br />The minority of critics, whom I side with unreservedly, were initiated enough to explain that Fight Club may lead many to the specious conclusion that it is shallow and frivolous. However, they point out quite rightly that after one more viewing, these misconceptions are demolished by what turns out to be an absorbing and intelligent criticism of Western Society.<br />Fight Club is engrossing, humourous, thrilling, raw and primal; it is an exemplary film with an ulterior motive, of which is to impart upon the viewer the tragic reality of the world we live in. And while it goes along with this task, it is vastly entertaining. Violence is not the point of the movie; it was merely the medium through which the angst of the characters trapped within the confines of a bleak life expressed themselves. The movie grips you from the start and maintains its hold until the ending, which, while I'm at it, is actually quite a stunner. <br />The chemistry between the two protagonists, acted to perfection by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, is very appealling, and the antithesis of what they fight for is personified by the character Marla, who  serves to turn this film into a neat, contrasted and well-crafted package. The director ensures that the film is immensely watchable during the whole 2 hour excursion, and when the end comes, it leaves a puzzling yet strangely attractive aftertaste which eventually causes coagulates into the realisation that Fight Club is a great movie.<br />The reason why I don't rate this film with the extra, elusive fifth star is because there are times when it is insensitive, unnecessarily crude and frustratingly inconsistent. These quibbles are minor ones though, and in the end they do not detract too much from the overall experience.<br />Buy this DVD. It is the definitive edition of a superb film that, while not soaring to the great heights attained by the best films of the 90s, manages to reassure us of Hollywood's capability for manufacturing something that is worth watching for what it is.

B000007OY0|5.0|I first saw this movie on board a bus heading to boston, and was thrilled with this movie. It is about a man, who has been falsely accused of murder. He is then sent to the Shawshank Prison, where he spends ten years before escaping.  The movie really portrayed what it can be like in prisons-- not how the guards treated people-- but hoe prisoners treat each other. During the movie, you forget that the people are convicts and criminals, and then think of them as people.  During the course of the movie, we see Andy, the main character, bring dramatic changes to the prison, and how he copes with life there. He gets a library, a way for inmates to get out and do better work in the community, educates some of the people he befriends, and uncovers the scandel that the prison warden is doing.  This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen, and it is plain to see why it won the nominations that it did.
0679879269|5.0|I was totally thrilled at this book as an end to Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy.  It was my favorite installment, in fact.  I am in total agreement that he truly is a master of his art... every scene is written so powerfully and intentionally... I would find it difficult not to marvel at his skill as an author and storyteller.  And now for my review:<br />Although I thought that the book started off a little slowly, and the momentum fell somewhat at one or two parts, most of the book is written with an intensity that is rarely found in young adult literature.  The characters have been so well developed through the Golden Compass/Northern Lights and Subtle Knife, that I felt I really knew them, and just when I did, Pullman threw in twists that left me rethinking everything.  Many scenes were incredibly enthralling, and there were moments when it was literally impossible to put the book down.  I have a distinct interest in the subject matter addressed in this book, and I think it admirable that Pullman would address religion as he does in a series targeted at young adults.  I felt emmersed in Lyra and Will's yet-unknown epic quest.  Even the &quot;villians&quot; were fascinating. (I found Lord Asriel to be one of the most interesting characters).<br />The reason, in my opinion, that this book deserves such acclaim is its ending.  I don't know that I've ever read such a beautifully written (or heart-wrenching,for that matter) conclusion to a series.  I was not &quot;let down&quot; at all by the way that Pullman ended it, quite the contrary.  I felt everything that the characters were feeling, and I cried through the final chapters along with them.  A happy ending would be too cliche, which Pullman certainly is not, and not real enough for the depth of this particular trilogy.  My single complaint about the end is that the &quot;War in Heaven&quot; should have been taken into more detail, but perhaps the slight indefinite conclusion to that aspect was intended toleave something up the the readers' imagination.  I didn't feel any of the disappointment that I've heard some readers express, but I just recently discovered Pullman's works, so I didn't have more than a few days to wait and speculate between books.  Maybe that's why.<br />In short, I strongly reccomend The Amber Spyglass, but must caution that it isn't for everyone.  Those easily offended by religious subject matter may want to look elsewhere.  Reading this trilogy also requires a degree of patience, because although most parts are captivating, the constant switching between different aspects of the plot can contribute to a momentary drop in the action.  Of course, these temporary drop-offs are more than compensated for later on.  His Dark Materials gives a totally different take on the fantasy genre than J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.  Whereas Harry Potter is more simple and yet unpredictable, His Dark Materials has more depth and complexity, but at an occasionally slower pace.

Fantastic. Just when you thought it couldnt get better, bam, theres &quot;Porcelain&quot;, &quot;Natural Blues&quot;(my no.1 fav), and &quot;South Side&quot;. The dance is there as well in such tracks as &quot;Body Rock&quot; and &quot;Honey&quot;. The album that sold cars,offered sitcoms opening themes, and more on T.V., Play is really what the world needed. Now everyone knows how good experimental/electronic music is. Play remains a staple in my stereo.

0385474547|5.0|&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is a novel written by an African for the African.  It is a stunning piece of work.  Mr. Achebe tells the story as it is and he makes no apologies.  He simply lets the read form his or her own emotions.<br />I first read this book when I was in junior high school and back then it was simply just a good story.  Now, 15 years later, I am better able to pick out the delicate intricasies of this book.  If you see this an over-simplistic story, you are missing the very essence of this novel.  This novel is not simply about the &quot;evil&quot; colonial powers coming to destroy a community.  It goes much deeper than that.<br />Mr. Achebe sets the stage of this story by showing detail the very culture of Okonkwo and his people.  With this foundation, we can truly appreciate how devastating it was for them when a people (the white people) came over and imposed their culture on them, a group of people who already had their own culture, without any regard to or any desire to even understand their established customs.   It ruined the very fabric of their society.<br />This is truly an excellent piece of literature.
B0000029DD|5.0|I was lucky enough to see Jeff Buckley in an all too short concert when I was in high school almost 7 years ago. Was then, am still now completely enthralled, entranced and bewitched by his voice, swooned and rocked to sleep by his music, &quot;Grace&quot; above all. Seeing him perform live is still one of the highlights of my still-young life.  His was a very tragic death, but I write this mostly to disagree with another reviewer who said that &quot;Sketches for My Sweetheart..&quot; were simply efforts made by Jeff Buckley's mother to &quot;cash in&quot;... While still reeling a bit from the shock of his death, I heard &quot;Everybody Here Wants You&quot; on our local NPR station, and ran to buy the set. I hear this compilation as just some thoughts, some more finished than others, of a brilliant mind just getting warmed up. The songs may have been simply sketches, but they illustrated maybe just the beginning of the breadth of his abilities. I recommend &quot;Grace&quot;, or &quot;Sketches...&quot;, or any live album to anyone curious for a different sound. Never before and never since have I heard music such as this. Jeff, please know that you were loved, and are missed greatly.
B00005B4GU|5.0|WOW!  This album is AWESOME!!!  Radiohead is a band that never gets boring!  Songs like Pyramid and Spinning Plates just create an eerie Radiohead-like world.  Though I personally like The Morning Bell track better on Kid A, this version definitely rolls better with the songs on this album.  It's a great cd to just play over and over again.  I'd call it the perfect combination between OK Computer and Kid A.

Drew Barrymore (Cinderella) lent an almost ethereal quality to the movie. She floated on the screen like an angel, even before she gets her wings. She will steal your heart with her acting! She plays a country girl or a queen with equal ease. Only Drew could have played this part so well.<br /><br />I found many contrasts in this movie. The idea of a greedy selfish woman chasing a rich man versus a man seeking the companionship of an intelligent woman who has inner beauty is contrasted quite beautifully in Ever After. A score fit for royalty fills out the film, carrying the emotions from light and carefree to deep and thoughtful, and sometimes even pensive. In some scenes, you must observe the facial expressions to completely appreciate the humor. You will laugh so many times you will want to watch it again. You will also laugh again the second time you watch it and will even appreciate the humor more. I could list 20 favorite witty lines at least.<br /><br />Cinderella is Danielle. To Danielle's stepmother, she is mearly a pebble in her shoe. To the Prince of France (Dougray Scott) she is a mountain of strength that inspires him to pursue his own dreams and \\"enlightens\\" him. While Danielle is trapped in a social nightmare as a servant girl, she is happy. The prince who has everything, is still trying to find himself. When Prince Henry and Danielle meet, she throws apples at him, not realizing who he is. When Danielle helps to free a servant from being sold into slavery with money she received at the time the prince \\"borrows\\" one of their horses to escape from the palace....they again meet and he is intrigued by her knowledge of a book her father gave to her just before he died.<br /><br />Prince Henry is not satisfied with his station in life so he seeks out ways to encourage his own happiness. He is destined to become king, yet does not desire the responsibility. Danielle is seeking love and has lost both her parents and her stepmother (Anjelica Huston) has lost the ability to love and is the child of an obsessive compulsive mother. One key to her character is when Danielle's father dies and all the evil stepmother says is: \\"You cannot leave me here.\\" She has a human side and we somehow feel we want to like her, yet her words at times are chilling!<br /><br />Her daughters are quite different. Jacqueline sees through their mothers fake attempts at deceiving their stepsister and Marguerite knows how to increase the intrigue, yet almost stalks the Prince to gain his attention. Danielle on the other hand casts an intoxicating spell on the Prince that he cannot resist.<br /><br />There is nothing feminist about this movie. Yes, Danielle does enjoy reading and when she is given the choice of any book on a bookshelf she says: \\"I could no sooner choose a star in the heavens.\\" She wants to educate herself, yet she does not demand that she be equal to the Prince, but does demand a respect for human rights. So perhaps that is what some viewers are picking up on. She is sweet and feminine and gains her man's respect so he naturally seeks her out as his equal. It IS about love!<br /><br />Love gives you wings so you can fly to the place you want to be. It is a decision of the heart, which should be considered with the intellect as well. Yes, some things are meant to be. You must see this movie! It is one of the most beautiful romantic comedies I have ever seen....twice in one night! The exquisite costumes and scenery are only the backdrop for sheer magic.<br /><br />Directors should take note of Andy Tennant's directing and I hope they will realize that with almost 700 reviews, a movie with this spirit is what we viewers love! Humor, romance, adventure, passion...this has it all. Escape for a few hours into the magical world only Cinderella can show you. I will be watching this movie many, many times. It deals with deeper issues and shows how people fall in love, the realistic way with magical results.<br /><br />No pumpkin or singing required ;>.

B00005B4GU|5.0|'Art is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end.'  Amnesiac is the embodiment of this (James Joyce) quotation.  Haunting soundscapes, vocals, you can hear guitars, dinosaur bones creaking, angel's screams, orgasmic, dry, livid.  Whatever kind of frenetic mind association games you want to play..<br />Amnesiac, contrary to its title, makes you remember.  It's synesthesia.  It's everything.
B00005BJC7|4.0|Although the picture doesn't depict it, this is actually the book shown on the cover.  I was almost wrangled into a fight at midnight tonight trying to get this, and I'm not sure why.  If you've been looking forward to this cd (i.e. writing days until release on your hand with a pen, staying up until midnight, refusing to download it) You'll very much appreciate the time and effort put into this extra few dollars.  I'm not going to review the musical content of the cd, as that's many, many more pages.  Here, I'll simply state that the Limited Edition is a nice thing to have.  Never will you wonder, when looking at the cover of your standard edition, &quot;I wonder what's in that book&quot;...
B00005B4GU|4.0|How dare I only give this album 4 stars?!?  Nothing Radiohead puts out will ever compare to the absolute brilliance of OK Computer, one of the few albums I would ever give 5 stars, hence the 4 star rating.  Still, this is an outstanding album.  I'm not sure how this cd holds up against Kid A...very similar, yet some subtle differences.  The lyrics are definitely superior on Amnesiac, but I think I enjoyed the overall atmosphere created by Kid A...It flowed better.  There are a few more actual <br />&quot;songs&quot; on this album.  Nevertheless, if you were disappointed with Kid A, don't expect to be pleased with this one.  It's no return to The Bends, or even OK Computer style.  If you're a Radiohead fan, or if you enjoyed Kid A, pick this one up, you won't be disappointed!  Personal favorites include Pyramid Song, You and Whose Army, I Might Be Wrong, Knives Out, and Life In a Glasshouse.  And the instrumental, Hunting Bears, is incredible.
0800177177|3.0|The movie itself is not that bad, what I didn't like is why they named it &quot;Bram Stocker's Dracula&quot;. While the book itself is great, the movie could also had been great if it wasn't for the the love story between Mina and Dracula, which has nothing to do with the book, while in Bram Stocker's Dracula Mina is, maybe the most interesting character and one of the most important ones, in the movie they changed the whole concept of this character... the love story doesn't fit quite well in the plot of the movie!
B00005AAFT|5.0|That means &quot;beauty in strenght&quot;, and thats exactly what this album stands for.  &quot;Mutter&quot; is a brilliant album in every aspect. Songwriting is superb,  the songs being concise, heavy yet melodic,  with a beautiful sadness in all of them.  Lyrics are also quite good.  The album sounds pretty cool, the bone-crunching guitars match perfectly with the delicate, melodic synths.  Tills vocals are much more mature than in the past 2 albums, theyre very emotional and real.  &quot;Mutter&quot; shows that neo-metal can go beyond the &quot;doom-and-gloom&quot; lyrics and the A.D.I.D.A.S. aesthetics: love, loss and compassion can actually be shown without losing a bit of strenght.  Excellent album.
B00005IBGQ|4.0|Rufus' first album was such a distinct, assured collection of music that I almost dreaded the follow-up; it did not seem likely that the same cool magic could occur twice.  Then I heard that Jon Brion, the producer of the first disk and a guy I happen to consider a genius, wasn't going to be working on the album and my expectations began to sink lower.  Then I heard &quot;Poses&quot; was going to have a &quot;stripped down&quot; approach and I braced for the sophomore slump.<br />So when I got a Secret Advanced Copy of the disk and played it one evening, I was surprised to discover... it might be even better than the first album.<br />The first album was like a busy tapestry on the Wall of Sound; it's a little cabaret, it's a little &quot;Pet Sounds,&quot; the production is built around lots of instruments and big music, Mellotrons and strings, and each song is a bit like a fantastic circus pushed into a small room.<br />&quot;Poses,&quot; on the other hand, smartly steps back and just lets Wainwright sing and play.  There's no way he could recapture the same, intricate atmosphere of the first one (either it wouldn't measure up, or if it did he'd be accused of re-hashing his own style) and it's good to hear his voice and the melodies clearly against the simple production.  &quot;Greek Song&quot; is like a sensual, droning remake of Lennon's &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot; and &quot;Rebel Prince&quot; smacks of a jazzier, smokier version of &quot;Mack the Knife.&quot;  <br />In fact, if you're a newcomer to the Sound of Rufus, this might be a better place to start than his debut.  It's a relatively calm, quiet collection and, to me, it sounds like the soundtrack to a rainy evening.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I am glad that this band is receiving the respect they deserve.  I've been a fan of them since December of 2000 and just got their U.S. released album.  It is, like everyone else has said, awe inspiring, majestic, and a bastion of creative force and energy.  I've never heard an album as good as this one and I am not quite sure I ever will.  It is undoubtedly the new benchmark of 21st century post modern rock.  I would keep going but unfortunately Sigur Ros' sonic soundscapes are ineffable and too surreal to limit with petty words.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Just when i think they have created the best album of all time, they cm up with another.  I am left speechless.  Well its &quot;no alarms or no surpise&quot; that radiohead has created another masterpiece.  I am just happy to have the chance to enjoy their music. We all should feel lucky that we have it in us to appreciate their music, cause there plenty who dnt know what has hit them and miss out on te amazing thing called RADIOHEAD!<br />all i have to say is sit back and FEEL the music.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radiohead's new record is probably the second worst one they have recorded. That is not very much of an insult, if you think about it. We all know the story about how Kid A shocked everyone, though I personally didn't see where else they could go. So, whats the new album like? A review.<br />PACKT LIKE SARDINES - When you hear the intro, where it is nothing more than a kettle drum and crappy electronic drum, you fear for one minute that the album will be horrible. But a washing keyboard comes in, reminiscent of NIN &quot;Closer&quot;, and it becomes better. The droning line &quot;get off my case&quot; may or may not be about the acceptance of Kid A.<br />PYRIMAD SONG - So the guitarist says he thinks its one of the best tunes they've ever recorded, and everyone goes flocking to this song. While one of the best on the record, it is NOT their best ever. It is pretty though, and its a wonderful sound when the strings and Thom sing in unison.<br />PULK/PULL REVOLVING DOORS - Something else like NIN's? Weird. Anyways, this track is good, I would've liked to see more variety on it, though.<br />YOU AND WHOSE ARMY? - Short doesn't necessarily mean bad. One of the few OKC-like tracks, its good, if a bit slow at first, but that's not bad for a 3 minute song.<br />I MIGHT BE WRONG - Very catchy, but gets kinda weary after a while. Cut a minute off.<br />KNIVES OUT - Some good guitar appregios, and one of the most straightfoward tracks. Also one of the most boring.<br />MORNING BELL AMNESIAC - I personally hate this one, just because the shuffle cut up original was creepy good, and this is just kinda crappy. Supposed to be nightmarish, but comes across as a mess.<br />DOLLARS AND CENTS - One of the better tracks, the strings play a totally different part. Love the buildup and explosion in the middle of the song.<br />HUNTING BEARS - Hey, this isnt THAT inferior. It's short, so thats good, but brings to mind some kind of desert tinted blue. Or maybe i'm just weird.<br />LIKE SPINNING PLATES - Probably the best electronic track they recorded, its very beautiful and kinda makes you smile. No, the backwards vocals are not a gimmick.<br />LIFE IN A GLASSHOUSE - Thom hits some horribly high notes on this, but it all holds together with a sense of something really important is happening. Great lyrics, great ending.<br />Its a mixed bag, ranging from ok to excellent. I miss the conceptual thread that made the past two records so good, too. Still worth it though, because hey, its Radiohead.
B00004XONN|5.0|The most striking thing about this album to me is its ability to cause strong emotional reactions - strange, displaced, from the heart achings and yearnings.  It's not the words, mind you, but the sounds.  Coming from an old blues/rock fan, weaned on cathartic power chords, the sensitivity and emotional power of Radiohead's plinks, plunks, blehs, and such cannot be explained!  Simply brilliant.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Saw the movie this weekend and loved it! Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor did a fantastic job and I applaud the risks they took. The reviews were correct - it was unlike anything I have ever seen and I am so glad there are still filmakers willing to do something different from the predictable summer parade of sequels and/or explosions.
B00000761Y|5.0|When discussing THE WHO, most avid fans would agree that this group is usually overlooked to the likes of Led Zeppelin or Hendrix.  However, the one characteristic that simply cannot be overlooked is THE WHO's ability to perform in front of an audience.  Considered by many to be the best live band of all-time, THE WHO grasp the audience through emotion and volume. Even with modern heavy metal bands such as METALLICA and SLAYER, the thirty plus year-old band known as THE WHO are still renowned as the loudest band of all-time.  Although their world record for holding the loudest concert has been recently broken by an underground punk band (who admittedly broke the record intentionally to hold the record status), THE WHO will always have the hardest rock and roll punch.  Not even Led Zeppelin could come close to maching THE WHO'S unchallenged authority in concert.  &quot;Live at the Isle of Wight&quot; is a phenominal release which captures THE WHO'S early success.  This is the only record that contains almost all of &quot;TOMMY&quot; in a live performance.  When comparing this album to &quot;live at Leeds,&quot; fans must be very careful.  Personally, I believe that both capture different aspects of THE WHO.  The &quot;Isle of Wight&quot; captures the band in a loud and excited frenzy.  This festival was the British version of Woodstock.  THE WHO were easliy able to steal the show, as they so often did.  With an outdoor venue, Pete Townsend was able to max-out his amps and let the volume fly.  As a result, their playing often times got ahead of itself, creating an out-of-sync characteristic at times.  On the flip side, however, the volume and incredible echo allowed for an amazingly powerful concert.  The &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; record was recorded at Leeds University on the outskirts of London.  This gig was indoors, and was much more intimate.  The crowd consisted of perhaps 5-8 thousand college students.  When compeared with the 100,000+ at the Isle of Wight, thedifference is astounding.  At Leeds, THE WHO were most definately in-sync.  They performed with incredible precision.  This is where most fans would give the nod to the &quot;Live at Leeds.&quot;  Although they sounded fantastic, the small venue did not permit the band to unleash hell as they were able to do at the Isle of Wight.  This leads to the all important question.  Which performance did I like better?  I won't beat around the bush and say that I liked both for seperate reasons, although that statement is true.  In honesty, I prefer the &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; record over the Isle of Wight.  The only reason is simple.  In the Isle of Wight release, there is simply too much &quot;Tommy&quot;  for my taste.  Don't get me wrong, I loved &quot;Tommy,&quot; but listening to the 18 or 19 tracks live does get old.  In Live at Leeds, they throw in some Tommy material, but do not get bogged down.  In all, both versions are ground-breaking, as well as breath taking.  They forever put THE WHO ahead of Led Zeppelin.  I only wish there were later releases in which THE WHO performe their later hits.
B000002HRE|5.0|I have been a Metallica fan for years, and when they first released Load, I like a lot of people was disappointed, and I saw this album as more of the same kind of ... (Re-Load after all).  I had written Metallica off as a band that used to be good.  Recently, I changed my mind.  I read a commentary of Kirk's guitar work, which some people like to complain about(too much Wah, blah, blah).  The reviewer was defending him and the band.  The point was, would you respect Metallica if they were still playing the Master of Puppets style of music in their jean jackets and unlaced high tops.  The answer is absolutely not.  They would be a group of four cheese balls that we wouldn't even be discussing(I can think of several bands like this). With this new attitude, I took a fresh look at the band.  I bought both Load and ReLoad and gave them a listen.  I have to say that I like them both. I should have known that some of the best tracks didn't get any air play.  Several bands have ripped off the old Metallica style that everyone raves about, but these guys have moved on.  They took their heavy sound, refined it, and added in some contemporary influences (I hear a little Alice in Chains and other early 90's grunge on a few of the tracks). <br />I am also a guitar player and I have since added both Load and ReLoad to my guitar music collection.  I have heard a lot of complaints about how the music is so weak now, and Kirk's guitar playing is just ... .  Here is my take on that.  From Kill 'em All through And Justice For All, Metallica progressive made their music faster and more complicated. The rhythms got faster and more complex, song structure got more complex, and they were using full barre chords instead of just power chords by And Justice For All.  Some of these songs are very challenging to play, but you can only take complexity so far.  Starting with the Black album, things are scaled down.  Song length is kept under control, and the songs are more focused (like theirearly work).  As for Kirk's guitar work, I think he is better than ever.  Being able to use the Wah to acutally get more expressive and vocal solos is a big challenge which he does admirably.  Sure he isn't playing pentatonic scales 100 miles an hour all the time, but he finally got that blues/metal blend he has been working at for so long. <br />Bottom line: Knowing the obsessive perfectionists that they are, I should have known better than to write them off.  Anyone who ever says that Metallic has sold out or not given a good effort is just plain wrong.  Ask yourself, why would they sell out now, what would they gain.  The answer is nothing(You think they need the money?!).  The only thing these guys are interested in is making music they enjoy playing.  If you don't like their new music, fine, but don't confuse that with selling out.  They have never lost sight of who they really make music for, and that is themselves, as it should be.  <br />Stepping off the soap box...<br />Some of the high points of this album are Fuel, The Memory Remains, Devil's Dance, Carpe Diem Baby, Where The Wild Things Are, Low Man's Lyric, Attitude, and my favorite is Fixxxer.  Another great effort from a great band.

B00005B4GU|5.0|I'm a relatively &quot;new&quot; Radiohead fan, but I've quickly fallen in love with their music, starting with OK Computer.  I haven't heard Kid A so I cannot judge Amnesiac against it, but I truly love this CD.  Whatever you're expecting, you'll be surprised.       Some people say that with the dehumanisation of Radiohead's lyrics (eg. not singing about that &quot;special&quot; girl from Creep anymore), it's hard to relate, but I find Amnesiac incredibly moving nonetheless.  Listening to it in the dark, I was partly scared (Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors - the bit that goes, &quot;But they are trapdoors that you can't come back from&quot;), partly awed, partly elevated.  Thom Yorke's vocals are simply perfect, they convey so much feeling...     My favourites at the moment are &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; (which is one of the most beautiful, sombre pieces of music I've heard in a long time, sad but beautiful: &quot;A moon full of stars and astral cars&quot;), &quot;You And Whose Army&quot;, with its heavenly crescendo which leaves you wanting more, &quot;Dollars And Cents&quot; (&quot;we're going to crack your little souls&quot;), and finally &quot;Life In a Glasshouse&quot; - bizarre, jazzy, and wildly inventive.  In fact I like every track.  I have to stop gushing, this isn't a totally perfect album, it takes a few listens before you're rewarded, and tracks like, &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; or &quot;Like spinning plates&quot; sometimes seem too obscure for their own good, but it's all so clever and addictive that I can't truly fault it.  Sometimes I can't believe this is going on commercial release, displayed in music stores worldwide, millions of copies produced, because it's so honest and original and unlike anything I've ever heard.  I don't know.  But right now I'm really loving it.  If you think you have the patience to give Amnesiac the chance it deserves, I strongly recommend you buy it.

I knew it was a bad sign when I couldn't understand the plot as it was described on the back of the box! Woody Allen does the most he can with his 20 minutes of screen time, and I'll always watch Peter Sellers, but the film is just so confusing that these great performances are lost in a mishmash of bright colors and bizarre visuals. Stay away and check out the far superior Austin Powers.

6302820448|5.0|Groundhog Day is a very good romantic comedy. Bill Murray is a guy who has the worst day of his life, and then finds he is trapped in it and must relive Groundhog Day until he makes everything the best it can possibly be. Even though the plot depends on similar scenes occuring numerous times, it never gets dull. By the way, I actually counted the number of times Murray relives Groundhog Day, and it comes to six weeks! I don't know if this was intentional, but it's a nice touch.
B00004XOWM|5.0|People are always wondering of the polemical New Metal. The sound of angry music is mixed with musical variety, but critics are saying that there is no music maturity in New Metal groups. Limp Bizkit is one of the first New Metal bands, and with KoRn, the more popular. As you'll see from this CD, Limp Bizkit not only shows their development as a New Metal original group, as an elevated quality of music.<br />Wes Borland, Fred Durst, DJ Lethal, Sam Rivers and John Otto proved that one good idea can come up from a few. The unusual mix that Limp Bizkit made since their first CD became a very alternative solution to a commercial music style.<br />From Intro to Outro, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water is by far what people need to see maturity in New Metal. And also, if you're a good listener, you will see that these guys are influencing loads of bands out there that are making their success. New Metal explosion is there, and Limp Bizkit is on the top. <br />Listen to My Way, and get a glimpse of what's to get on light metal, listen to Hot Dog and get what you always wanted from Limp Bizkit - posture. Get strenght on Rollin', Livin' It Up and Take a Look Around, and chill with It'll be Ok and The One. This CD is a tour by the New Metal possibilities, and is a must to all the critics, fans and musicians.<br />As to the public, the fame that Limp Bizkit acquired so far, especially with this album, proves that they are welcome. Rockers and Hip Hoppers - everybody all around the world is buying Chocolate Starfish and The Hot Dog Flavored Water. Keep the tracks loud, and highlight the only thing that is meant to make a music into a good music - making you feel good.<br />Go for it.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead's newest offering was recorded at the same time and location as their last album (&quot;Kid A&quot;).  You can hear little pieces of &quot;Kid A&quot; mixed into &quot;Amnesiac.&quot;  But, while &quot;Amnesiac&quot;  sounds very similar to &quot;Kid A&quot;, it also sounds very similar to other Radiohead albums.  For those of you who hated the extensive use of computers and lack thereof of guitars on Kid A, then you'll love this album.  &quot;Amnesiac&quot; takes the BEST parts of Radiohead's previous albums, combines them together, and forms them into one cohesive unit.  This album is like a mix between &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;the bends.&quot;  I feel that this album is a lot stronger than &quot;Kid A&quot; for this reason.  I also feel that this album is one of Radiohead's best because it uses all of the things that Radiohead does the best.  On this album you'll hear: an orchestra, electric guitars, piano, organs, bells, different kinds of drums including electronic, and odd noises that are characteristic of Radiohead albums.  Some of the music on this album is so good that there are no words to describe it.  The music combined with Thom Yorke's vocals make this album as deep as the ocean.  The only problem I have with this album is that the songs are so imaginative that it is hard to pin down exactly what Radiohead is trying to say.  But, maybe that's the point? Also some of the music isn't that great such as &quot;Like Spinning Plates.&quot;  I don't really care for this song.  The best song on this album is &quot;Pyramid Song.&quot;  This song is probably one of Radiohead's greatest going as far back as &quot;Creep.&quot;  The first time I heard &quot;pyramid song&quot; I loved it.  I'm sure you'll feel the same way about this album.  By the way, if you're thinking of getting the limited edition CD with the 32 page booklet, don't get it.  Unless you like looking at weird pictures and drawings that defy explaination...that is.
B00004X0ER|3.0|Picking up where their countrymen The Nomads left off, Sweden's (or so their bio claims, but don't be surprised if it comes out that they're actually from somewhere like Cleveland or Chicago) Hives churn up a frothy high-octane, soul powered punk rawk maelstrom whose influences can be traced back to the MC5 and 1960's garage bands like The Seeds and The Shadows Of Knight. Boasting a production so raw that you can almost smell the viscera, the sonics exhibited on \\"A Get Together To Tear It Apart\\" and \\"Knock Knock\\" expose The Hives' masterplan: plug in and turn it up. Don't be fooled by the cover: The Hives aren't punk rock's answer to The Monkees, more like its version of the men in black. Bottom line: The Hives should be considered dangerous to children and small animals.
0440219078|3.0|I thought this was a good book, even though it confused me a bit, but it shows the true colors of the world and the people.  I feel that this book is a good example of how things can change just by the people that come in and out of our lives.  It makes you feel something that someone or something couldn't.  This was a good book for the people to understand, love, peace, and the true meaning behind life.
B000001EIA|1.0|So sad that Kiss were so desperate at this point in their career that they felt compelled to do the unplugged thing and display the logo of corporate deathsucker MTV on their album.  Sure, it's great to see Ace and Peter back in the fold, but is three good songs worth buying this dreck for?  It's nice to hear the acoustic treatment of songs like &quot;Comin' Home&quot; and &quot;Rock And Roll All Nite,&quot; and Ace's cover of the Stones' &quot;2000 Man&quot; is welcome in any form, but &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot;?  Give me a break.  Based on the reception this album got, the band decided to reform for one more tour (or was it two or three?) with the greasepaint and while it initially seemed like a good idea, they soon wore out their welcome, playing by my best count at least three &quot;final&quot; shows in the U.S. alone.  Especially tragic when I think how much guff I took for loving Kiss in high school back in the 1970's.  To quote Ian Hunter, &quot;It ain't easy when you fall.&quot;
B00005BJC7|4.0|Radiohead scores somewhere between OK Computer and Kid A on their latest release, both in terms of quality and creativity. Listeners still yearning for the melodies of Let Down or the languor of No Surprises since OK Computer's release will think that Radiohead has returned to their senses--somewhat.  Those who hold Kid A as a remarkable breakthrough (including myself) might feel that Amnesiac falls short of their previous triumph.<br />The limited edition CD is a must for true fans; packaging has increasingly become part of the group's artistry, and the collector's book is an impressive visual counterpart to the music.  <br />After a first listen, standouts include 'Dollars &amp; Cents' and the incredible 'Pyramid Song.'  Like their previous albums, though, I anticipate that my preferences will change as I become more familiar with the work.
B000002URV|5.0|There are only 3 words that I can use to discribe this cd...I LOVE IT!  I have owned it for nearly 10 years and I never get tired of hearing it.  From the rythmic beats, the gregorian chants, this cd will never go out of style.  It's one of those albums that you can listen to anytime...whether driving, trying to get to sleep, relaxing, doing housework, whatever.  It fits any mood.  Go out and buy this cd..you will love it!
0064471047|5.0|The dearly loved chronicles of Narnia has always held a wonderful place in my heart, from the time it was read to me by my first grade teacher.  Each time I pass a wardrobe, I often wonder what mysteries are on the other side.  Will a faun lead me to a new and great adventure? And when I see I lion I think of the magnificence of Aslan with his piercing eyes and mighty roar.<br />For those who have not read this book, you must be ready for something that is more than just a beautiful story about children, the magical land of Narnia, a wicked witch, and an &quot;untamed Lion&quot; named Aslan, whose very name brings joy to the heart of all who hear it.  It is also an allegory of Christ and His Love for all, the Great Lion of Judah who is kind, loving, but, indeed, never a tame God!<br />I have spoken to people who have read this book as a child and did not know that this level was present in the books; that's ok, because you can read it again as an adult and see how Lewis, in his inimitable way, can beautifully weave a story of suffering and grace, loss and celebration.<br />For children, it is a book that will give them a love of reading, of imagination and joy.  For adults, it can teach us simple faith in our always-complex world.<br />Read and enjoy!
0385486804|4.0|Naive? Stupid? Brave? Psycho? You'll think of all of these descriptions as you follow the &quot;hero&quot; through his travails in the cold, lonely back country of Alaska. One thing that can be truly said is that this is a sad story.
0790729652|1.0|Okay, I have not bought or watched BATMAN on DVD.  I already own this fine film on VHS.  Why 1 star you ask?  Simple.<br />With all of the hype...all of the propoganda...all of the BEHIND THE SCENES stuff I've seen on SUPERMAN (recently released), why the devil do they NOT do this with BATMAN?  C'mon!  What's the purpose of owning BATMAN on DVD when there is nothing special about it?!?  The film is excellent and is worth 5 stars.  But I am reviewing the DVD - THE DVD, which in the year 2001 is ridiculous.  C'mon Warners!  What the devil are you thinking?  I remember the BATMAN-crazed hype in 1989.  I remember a behind the scenes special and a whole lot more.<br />As for this one, it rates te same as the others.  If you want the film only, its worth it.  If you want some special stuff like ANY DVD NOW HAS NOWADAYS, forget it. Buy it on VHS.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Kid A, and Amnesiac actually surpasses that.  Where Amnesiac is definitely cast from the same cloth as Kid A, it does stand alone, it's not just Kid B as some critics have suggested. There is more traditional &quot;band&quot; music here, they actually dust off the guitars for several songs.  &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; just might be the most gorgeous song that RH has ever done.  &quot;You and Whose Army&quot; is RH at their anthemic best.  &quot;Knives Out&quot; is a tip back to &quot;The Bends&quot; days, but still fits in with this collection that definitely pushes the limits. &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; shows that only Radiohead can record a song that is essentially played backwards, and make it a beautiful.  And they continue their pattern of great closing songs with &quot;Life In a Glass House&quot; and it's New Orleans jazz feel.  Whereas Kid A took several listens to get used to, Amnesiac hits you right from the beginning, although that may be because Kid A prepared us for this.  Nothing prepared us for Kid A.  This is music you can get lost in, and it stays with you.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is amazing, its everything I wanted to hear in an album and more. The songs/journeys/epics/whatever u want to call them are like noises in my mind which come together beautifully and take me away to a place where everyhting i want to hear, i am hearing. If drugs are illegal, this album should be banned from the shelves, because after listening to this i am high as a kite.
B000001E7T|5.0|Uncompromising and influential. One of the most important albums ever made. An essential record for all CD collectors and anyone interested in rediscovering the beauty that is music.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I really dont write too many reviews.  But amnesiac is a masterpiece.  It is definatly in the same mold of Kid A.  It has almost a dreamy sound to it.  I am not going to get into the specifics of each individual track because that isn't what this album is about.  Each song flows beatifully into the next to form almost a musical expierience.  This is one of those albums that you get your moneys worth and you dont feel like you have been ripped off.  Radiohead really puts forth effort to put out a quality product in a music industry that is lately in my views really dissapointing.
B00005B4GU|5.0|For those of us who bought KID A and still haven't committed suicide, Amnesiac is yet another concerted effort by Radiohead to focus their creativity on describing the angst of a severely depressed genius. Radiohead is remarkable in the fact that within the genre of internationally recognized pop music, this band is one of the only with the balls or know-how to do anything innovative whatsoever. Just imagine what we all would be missing out on if Thom Yorke had started taking prozac at an early age. The album is no laughing matter. I'd recommend this album to anyone who would like to find out what music can sound like outside of the constraints of what's already been done and to those looking for inspiration to think outside the box. I give the album five stars for uncompromising artistic passion and attention.
0375501851|3.0|I became interested in reading this book after reading many wonderful reviews. After having read it, I must say I was disappointed. The beginning of the book had me hooked, but I had to force myself to finish it. The writing is superb, the characters are very colorful and interesting, but the story just didn't interest me. The book is about three main families: the Joneses( English father, Jamaican mother, one daughter), the Iqbals ( Bengalis, mother and father, twin sons) and the Chalfens (English, mother and father and four sons). It deals with immigrants trying to assimilate, cultural differences, family conflicts, racial issues, religious issues. Too much going on! I also was let down by the ending.
079072961X|4.0|so i'm a huge harrison ford fan and i realize i'm biased by that so i'll admit it up front.  i also really like tommy lee jones and i think that both ford and jones do a good job in this movie.  it's not easy to take a movie based on a tv show and do it well, but this project kept me interested, even though you know the whole time what will happen in th end.  this one was a little more plot driven then it's sequel, us marshalls, and i although i usuall enjoy action, i actually liked this one more.  maybe the plot just didn't seem quite so worn out yet...
B00005AXEL|1.0|This album is dreadful. Every song sounds the same (thanks to Sheryl Crow) and Stevie's voice is more monotone and without range than ever. The generic backing tracks are the worst thing though, with electronic drumtracks and the same beat on every song, they sound like hip hop tracks. What happened to real live rock bands playing the instruments? Stevie was once the queen or rock, well, she'll never lay claim to that again with preprogammed music like this. Top it all off with uninspired guest appearances by people who have absolutely nothing in common with Stevie's style such as Macy Gray and Sarah Machlachlan in what's an obvious attempt to get airplay and you have the worst album she has ever released.
B00005B36H|3.0|I have tried over and over to force myself to like this cd, but i still cant compare it to their old stuff.  It isnt exactly a bad album, but most of it halfway puts me to sleep.  The whole of it is just monotonous, I know theyre trying to go for a progressive epic style, but it doesnt really progress to anything, the climaxing of all the waiting in some of the songs is just weak.  The same thing is done much better in well made progressive trance songs, they are basically long epics that build, then finally hit you with a worthy climax, actually making the wait worth it.  It's the same principle Aenima works on, it builds quietly, then finally sends a spine tingling shrill down your spine.  <br />Also, it seems in alot of songs that there is so much activity going on it doesnt even seem melodic.  Then there's Maynards voice, it sounds like he doesnt have the vocal range like he did in undertow and aenima, more the angry suppressed voice that was ready to explode when he was with a perfect circle.<br />Overall, it isnt a bad album, it has a few good songs, and the cover artwork seems to be worth the 12$ i paid for it.  Its nothing really new, and Tool isnt really pioneering anything, you just have to know where to look.  Also, most people i see reviews from (and people i know) are blindly obsessed Tool fans that think that as long as tool did it, its perfect and wouldnt even put the thought in their head that maybe its not all that great...
0060263857|5.0|We read Charlotte's Web very early - my son was four.  Since that's a good deal younger than the suggested age, I thought some of you might want to know that if you want to get started reading chapter books with your young children, give this one a try.  Mine was enthralled the whole time.
B00004XOWM|1.0|The one thing I really, REALLY can't stand is when some musicians start singing about how great they are. God, that is such a turnoff! And it's espically annoying when it's a cd like this one, where the only true meaning they're trying to get across is &quot;We're badasses&quot;. Can't you just taste the formula behind every single track? Yuck...it makes me sick.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Simply espectacular!!!!! this album confirms two things: first, this is the beggining of a new music power that its gonna blow and will live other styles of music almost dead, and second radiohead has two of the best albums ever made in the history of music, what proves that they are one of the best bands in the history of music
0684843749|5.0|Very cool book. Overwhelming really - so much information and very helpful for looking for new exercises extra nad staying fresh.<br />One complaint - I really hate the pictures of all the new loser bodybuilders - Priest, Coleman etc.... I'd rather have a classic edition with nothing but pictures of the 40's/50's/60's/70's greats.<br />After-all - classic bodybuilding died in 1983 and we saw the emergence of the freaks.<br />Bodybuilding is in a sad, sad state today.<br />It never got any better than Arnold, Frank Zane and Steve Reeves.<br />Long live Frank Zane and Arnold Schwarzenegger!!!<br />(Check out Steeve Reeve's Body Building - the Natural way!)
B000002C25|5.0|Who said anything about bloated and overproduced?  Be Here Now ranks as one of my favorite albums of all time.  It hooks you from the first track and doesn't let go of you untill the door shuts on the &quot;All Around the World (Reprise)&quot; at the end of the album.  This album should be the standard to which all rock musicians aim.  While nearly all the tracks are not radio friendly due to their length, you find yourself wishing that the song could go on forever even after the 7 minute mark in &quot;D'You Know What I Mean?&quot;  This classic album should be owned by everyone, so don't let others tell you what to think, if you weren't an Oasis fan before listening to it, you will be one after!
0618084746|5.0|&quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; is a story of several disparate people living in a small city in the deep South (presumably Georgia) in the late 1930's.  Each main character is given focus for a chapter while the other characters fade into the background, then the next chapter will focus on another character in which the focal character of the previous chapter becomes a background character, etc.  Sherwood Anderson used a similar style of &quot;sketch&quot; writing in his &quot;Winesburg, Ohio,&quot; and the two novels share a theme of psychological and social isolation, but McCullers's novel is sharper, more vivid, detailed, and immediate, and evokes a keener sense of empathy in its characters.   <br />There is a popular cafe in town owned by a solicitous middle-aged man named Biff Brannon.  The cafe is frequented by a deaf-mute man named John Singer whose unsettling presence piques everyone's curiosity.  Singer befriends two ideologically aligned men, an alcoholic drifter named Jake Blount and a black doctor named Benedict Copeland.  Blount and Copeland both happen to be radical Marxists; Blount denounces capitalism and the exploitation of workers, while Copeland exhorts his people to become self-sufficient and dignified.  When Blount and Copeland finally meet and speak face to face, they agree on the problem but cannot agree on the solution.<br />And then there's the young teenage girl Mick Kelly, a tomboy who has little interest in acting ladylike and emulating her older sisters, and whose family runs a boarding house in which Singer rents a room.  She is at the age when her life is in several states of transition -- physical maturation, artistic revelation (via Beethoven's Third Symphony, no less), sexual awakening, and the initial responsibilities of adulthood.  It is remarkable how her character is so innocent yet at the same time so complex and worldly -- like a female Tom Sawyer, she blazes her own trail through society and is ready for anything. <br />These people hover around Singer like satellites and use him as a sounding board for their problems while he listens attentively and offers symphathy.  Why they are drawn to Singer is no mystery -- it is said that a good conversationalist is one who listens well rather than talks.  Singer has his own problem -- loneliness for the absence of his institutionalized friend, another deaf-mute, the only kind of person who can relate to him. <br />The novel illustrates that underneath the idyllic calm of traditional Southern gentility bubbles a cauldron of racial tension and imminent violence, symbolically fueled by the heat and humidity and swampy gloom.  Towards the end of the novel there is an incident involving a riot at the fair where Blount works; in the way the local newspaper covers the story, McCullers offers a subtle ironic statement about how the country (the South in particular) is concerned more with the threat of Communism than with racial discord.  And she was only 23 when she wrote this?  Amazing.
B00003OST8|5.0|Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin Hood, indeed! This glorious Technicolor swashbuckler from 1938 is such a joyous and entertaining film. Everything in this movie is top-notch, from the cast to the cinematography to the musical score. What more can I say? Well, I have to say that I love the greens in the Technicolor photography. They look so lush, vibrant, colorful, and awe-inspiring, especially in the Sherwood Forest. There's also some moments of humor in the movie, just like in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; or any other action/adventure film. Even over 60 years later, this movie still dazzles and brings joy to any movie lover, including myself.
0446677450|5.0|I listened to the tapes and they totally changed my perception of how I view money. I did not know what was a liability and and asset. It was really an eye opener for me. The good thing is I am just starting in in the work industry!
B00003CXP1|5.0|Having not seen the other title under this talented director, i have no ground on which to stand in saying that he is incredibly talented, but from seeing this powerful and chilling tale and I have no option to say but that. The movie, although graphic and at times hard to watch due to the disturbing nature of the film, is filled which exceptional talent and promises to go far. Ellen Burstyn was brilliant. My giving this movie five stars is justified by the sheer power behind the films story. Outstanding and recommended to all.
B00000IMTG|4.0|I rated this 4 out of 5 because of the shortage of music. The entire disc clocks in at 64 minutes - somehow, I remember it being at least 90 on vinyl. But that's probably due to getting up &amp; flipping the records over, and partying in between! Seriously, this is the best lineup of '70's hard rock musicians you'll ever find - and the collection is especially a gem for showcasing the late great Cozy Powell's drumming. The music &amp; energy consistently leaps out of the speakers. Rainbow's collective talents for rocking dynamics and lyrical majesty are unparallelled in this genre; the powerful jamming on &quot;Blues&quot;, &quot;Catch the Rainbow&quot;, and &quot;Mistreated&quot; play effectively with sonic ranges from full-volume thrusting to utter silence. And if the &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; intro w/ &quot;Kill the King&quot; doesn't make you jump outta your chair, call a nurse.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I disagree with other reviewers who say this album is not entralling on the first listen. Unlike Kid A, which took me about 200 spins to \\"get,\\" Amnesiac grabs ahold of you from the first measures to the end.<br />Kid A scared me; I still can't listen to it by myself driving at night. I think that was the point of the album: it challenged us, it angered us, it drove us insane - with its subtle beauty.<br />Amnesiac engages you and takes away all the feelings of isolation and loneliness that Kid A brought. It's almost as if Kid A was meant to condition us so we could hear Amnesiac better.<br />The songs are lovely. I love Pyramid Song and You and Whose Army. Powerful stuff there.<br />Amnesiac has the off-the-wall beauty of Kid A but the accessibility of Ok Computer. You'll love it.
B00005BF9Z|4.0|Let me start by saying that Clandestino is a classic, and that status probably won't be eclipsed by this release. Proxima Estacion: Esperanza is, however, a fine album, and I'm sure I'll listen to it over and over this summer (especially when Manu comes to Summerstage!!). There's really not any change of musical personality over three years demonstrated here, and some songs (and sound effects) are almost exact pastiches of what appears on Clandestino. It is nonetheless a great formula, and I love Manu and the message he bears.
B000002L3P|5.0|Being that we have hung out a few times, He is a very down to earth guy and is very much in to his music which makes him OUTSTANDING! If you ever get a chance to see him play live you will see what I mean &quot;in to his music&quot;. You have to buy this CD and all the others as well.
B00005B4GU|3.0|As a fan of someone who somewhat enjoys sonic music/techno/trance, or whatever you wish to call it, I think Radiohead is being over-rated.  There is nothing genius or original here whatsoever.  For those of you who have not been anywhere in the 80s or 90s, there has been Brian Eno, Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin, and Autechre, and many more, so Kid A and Amnesiac aren't necessarily original, like OK Computer was.  And they aren't genius either.  &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; is a repeated beat, &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; is excruciatingly minimalist, and the repeated phrase to fragmented beats in &quot;Packt Like Sardines&quot; may seem catchy, but is unnecessary and a step down from their previous genius with multiple notes, multiple lines, and a FULL SONG WITH NO REPETITION, with CHANGE and lyrics with meaning and honesty, with heart.  So, what people are saying about Kid A and Amnesiac is not necessarily true.<br />On the other hand, as music, there is high points in Amnesiac.  Pyramid Song is a wonderful bit, Knives Out is great, and Life in a Glass House is interesting.  All the other songs are entertaining and dramatic, but somewhat forgettable (no pun intended)...just like Kid A was.  Even though Amnesiac is much better than Kid A, in that there's more structure, concept, and stability to Amnesiac, it is still a major disappointment, coming from a very original, genius band.  They could do so much more with these...unfinished pieces.  I wish for the day they would make OK Computer 2.<br />I would still give them credit for Amnesiac, though...let's just hope the techno/electronica/ick thing is finished.  It is also a very depressing and vivid album...filled with sad, horrifying imagery and odd-ball mind toying...the ways your mind can react to this can be very stunning...anyway, that's the end of my review.  This is for Radiohead fan puppets, who will love anything that Radiohead does, and for those who like techno and electronica, and not the old Radiohead.
B00003CXQX|5.0|I've always been a Disney film fan, even without the excuse that &quot;I have a child.&quot; But the last Disney movie to really grab me was Toy Story 2. Before that Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. Now the Emperor's New Groove ... I have to say I didn't think this would be a good film, but I got it because my 4-year-old wanted to rent it. Now it's the one film she wants to see over and over and neither my husband or I get tired of it. This film is laugh-out-loud funny. I love the mismatched duo of Yzma and Kronck and of course the soft-spot in my heart goes out to Pacha and his great lesson that we can all find good in everyone, if we look deep enough. I heard this movie went through different incarnations, but the end result is definitely worth the effort. Stellar voice cast and, of course, LOVE that Sting is singing the film's main song &quot;My Funny Friend and Me.&quot;  Definitely worth adding to the collection.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|I bought this on a whim, having seen a lot of previews for the movie. boy, is it laughable-literally, some of the songs (namely rhythm of the night, roxanne, elephant love medley, hindi sad diamonds) are cheesy and awful beyond belief.  The voices of Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor are tolerable, although their tracks  are definitely over-produced to attempt to cover up their inadequacies. <br />No one buys a soundtrack expecting a classic, and after getting past the really bad tracks named above, some of the rest is pleasant and even, occasionally, fun. Just overall, mediocre.
B00004T9UH|1.0|When you buy an edited version of this CD, is it just me, or is Eminem so much of an utterly profane artist that all you hear is silence? I would never buy this for myself or for anyone. I would just like to advise parents (being the oldest of 6 myself)that if you ARE AGAINST YOUR CHILDREN HEARING PROFANITY, DON'T GIVE IN AND BUY THEM THE &quot;EDITED VERSION&quot;! No matter how cleanly they try to take out the utter bigotry, racism, and down right ugliness, it will never remove the images set forth by eminem. Even though you cannot hear Eminem's words, you know exactly what he is trying to say. When you settle for the &quot;edited&quot; version because you don't want to know about his profanity, Eminem laughs all the way to the bank and somehow still manages to give off the same impression as before - images of sex, violence, hatred, killing his wife (HIS MOM!?) and other things I think could spawn a whole new generation of terrorists! Please, my brother has this CD. Do not purchase it!
B000031WBQ|5.0|The Concerto and Prelude on this recording are both candidates for a list of art works that the average person on the street will recognize instantly even if a majority of such persons have no idea of the title or the composer of the piece!  Even if you don't particularly go in much for the ultra-romantic affect of these pieces you simply must have at least copy of them around the house as a matter of principle, even if you find them evolving into self-parody or some kind of guilty pleasure over time.<br />You can find amusing examples of how these pieces have been popularly exploited in the movies of the 40s and 50s; the Concerto plays a prominent role in the comedy &quot;Seven Year Itch,&quot; and the prelude is performed by Harpo Marx in &quot;A Day At The Races.&quot;  But I digress.<br />These particular recordings are both legendary and sonically well preserved for their age. If you're looking to purchase a first recording of these great warhorses this is a nice choice at a bargain of a price.<br />Take with a large grain of salt the mixed review of the person above who describes them as &quot;uneven and out of tune.&quot;  Personally I don't even agree with his observation of the first movement of the Concerto being too fast.
B000003TAW|4.0|This album was a pleasant surprise when it was first released... a garage band with a sense of humour (and lacking true novelty status, thank God) and great taste with regard to their influences.<br />As we all know, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; became famous due to their masterful Spike Jonze video, but also because it was a great summer song.  It was rock 'n' roll for the 90s, but you could trace a line from it straight to Buddy himself (RIP), who was probably smiling from on high when it was released.<br />LP length as well, wisely avoiding the 'filler-four' tunes most bands usually tack on to their debut CD just to give it more value; &quot;In the Garage&quot;, &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot;, &quot;Surf Wax America&quot;... this is a disc that was tailor-made for booming out of a Cutlass convertible circa '67.<br />Will it be a classic in 20 years?  Only time will tell.  But I still enjoy it today, and I have a feeling I'm not alone on that score.
B000002BUY|5.0|I would reccomend this album to anyone who has an apprieciation for highly original bands. More consolidated and melodic than thier previous release 'fungus amongus', S.C.I.E.N.C.E, with it's curious mix of funk metal, scratch and a dash of drum and bass is truly a classic example of how there is hope for music. It also illustrates a brand new bandwagon that no doubt will be pounced on in the future. They seem to have had a lot of fun making this record, especially the little hidden track at the end, which may be little spun out, but in itself is extraordinary and highly intelligent. My favourite song on this album has to be 'vitamin', because of it's chunky funkiness, and a mean riff that still feels new after listening to it 20 times. 'Nebula' is a wacky jungle/metal experimental track, with plenty of little touches and nuances provided by these awesome musicians. Boyd is a fantastic vocalist, guitars are new and interesting, Dirk lance's bass solo is breathtaking in 'redefine'. The tracks flow into each other in the most alluring fashion, each song drags you into it untill the end. Check this album out, it's for your own good. You'd also be a fool to miss out on thier latest release 'make yourself'. Later Glenn
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead is one of my favorite bands, and I had high expectations for Amnesiac. Thankfully, it met my expectations. Amnesiac is another amazing, brilliant album from Radiohead and is the best album I've heard that's come out in 2001 thus far. Amnesiac seems to be more musical than last year's Kid A and a little less experimental, but just as unconventional and creative. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; features a moving string section while &quot;Knives Out&quot; has kind of a dark, jazzy, laid-back feel. &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; is a strange, but fantasticly produced cut. &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; is kind of Amnesiac's &quot;Optimistic&quot; that is it's probably the most conventional song on the album even though it's still very out-there and unconventional. The new version of &quot;Morning Bell&quot; is different but still great and the last track &quot;Living In A Glass House&quot; is unlike anything Radiohead's ever done. If you are a Radiohead fan, you have to own this of course. And if you're tired of music's current trends, this should restore your faith in music. Buy this immediately.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|...and on about this movie, but I believe it's something you have to see to believe--and appreciate.  I laughed, I cried, and I was blown away by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor--I knew they could act, but who knew they could sing, and sing great!!!  I was so blown away that I came right home and ordered the soundtrack!  I can only hope that this magnificent film is not ignored come Oscar-time, especially the song &quot;Come What May&quot;--absolutely beautiful!!!!!  Well, I've gone on long enough--just 3 more words...go experience it!!!!!!
B000001A3H|4.0|I still can't get over the fact that these are just kids playing this music... in their late teens &amp; twenties. Josh Homme on guitar is amazing. Sabbath influence is huge as Ozzy, Iommi &amp; Co would be downright proud. John Garcia's vocals remind me of a young &amp; raw Alice Cooper - tho not quite as good. I think if you had to label one down fall of the band, it would be Garcia's vocal range. Brant Bjork on drums is very capable and unlike so many drummers, contributes musically &amp; lyrically. Bassist Nick Oliveri is fine, but his name is not on any of the music or lyric credits. This CD has several jams (no vocals) of which &quot;Molten Universe&quot; &amp; &quot;Apothecarie's Weight&quot; are the best. The heaviest tunes (my personal favorites) are &quot;Thumb&quot;, &quot;Green Machine&quot; &amp; &quot;Writhe&quot;. &quot;Capsized&quot; is a nice semi-acoustic lead into &quot;Allen's Wrench&quot;. Track 13 (&quot;Mondo Generator&quot;) I simply can't understand most of what Garcia's mumbling about because his voice is being screached thru a filter. Great CD by a relatively unknown band. You'll enjoy this album if you're a fan of hard rock. If you were heavy into Black Sabbath &amp; Ozzy, I think you'll REALLY enjoy it.
B000002TPS|4.0|While not as assiduous and painstaking as its predecessor, &quot;Countdown To Extinction&quot;, this album still delivers the goods. The general sound and production of &quot;Youthanasia&quot; is more stripped down and bare; this serves only as a very useful ingredient in this album's recipe, making it interesting and easy to digest.<br />This album is no different from Megadeth's previous releases in that the opening few tracks are flawless. ( Am I alone in thinking this? Consider this set-list : &quot;Wake Up Dead&quot;; &quot;The  Conjuring&quot;; &quot;Peace Sells&quot;; &quot;Into The Lungs Of Hell&quot;; &quot;Set The World Afire&quot;; &quot;Holy Wars&quot;; &quot;Hangar 18&quot;; &quot;Symphony Of Destruction&quot;; &quot;Train Of Consequences&quot;; &quot;Trust&quot;; &quot;Prince Of Darkness&quot;; &quot;Disconnect&quot;. Minor quibbles aside, this is a setlist from the Gods! ) &quot;Youthanasia&quot; does not falter either - its consistent excellence is commendable and you'll be hard pushed to find any weak songs on it.<br />One would be being somewhat liberal with the truth to call this a speed metal album. No way Jose. Like &quot;Countdown To Extiction&quot;, and, indeed, all of Megadeth's post-rust albums, this creation emanates more precision and melody; but don't be fooled... this album rocks as hard as a hell!!<br />My personal favourites from the album are : &quot;Train Of Consequences&quot;; &quot;Addicted To Chaos&quot;; &quot;A Tout Le Monde&quot;; &quot;Blood Of Heroes&quot;; &quot;Family Tree&quot;; &quot;Youthanasia&quot; and &quot;I Thought I Knew It All&quot;. The song &quot;Victory&quot;, although not on my Youthanasia &quot;elite&quot; list, is very clever lyrically; it features Mustaine simultaneously punning and relating certain previous Megadeth song titles into the turbulent episodes of his life (e.g may the past &quot;Rust In Peace&quot; In &quot;Hangar 18&quot; and &quot;Countdown To Extinction&quot; just be a bad dream ).<br />&quot;Youthanasia&quot; is testament to Megadeth's evolution and not losing its identity. Additionally, one must respect the longevity of the boys and the fact they've managed to balance old and new without sounding dated. A great achievement.
B00005B4GU|1.0|If kid-A is a bad recording, this one is worse. If music is music not just a compilation of sound, there must be something called'melody' and 'rithym'. ok, i know today everybody must be VERY abstract to demonstrate that he has somekind of class,but then, as i said in the review of Kid-A, it just isn't music anymore. by the way,if you like it, i'd tell you that for the same sufferrence i must take hearing such a recording, i will rather pick up any Stravinsky or Dubussy's crazy compositions. isn't that more classy?  radiohead is a middle-talent band, the Bends is the best album they made and that's all.
B00005IBGQ|4.0|Rufus continues to grace us with thoughtful pop.  The first album introduced us to the love, life, and the Salvation Army.  Poses is a reminder where pop SHOULD be.  Imagine a place where lyrics are just as important as the melodies surrounding them.  Granted, Rufus can sound a little &quot;wrist-slitting&quot; (see The Tower of Learning and The Consort).  My favorite song is Grey Gardens (Tadzio) with a close second as California.  Great lyrics &quot;California Calilfornia You're such a wonder that I'll think I'll stay in bed/ Big time rollers, part time models,  so much to plunder that I think I'll sleep instead./I don't know this sea for neon, thousand surfers, whiffs of freon...&quot;<br />Strongly reccommend seeing him in concert if you have a chance.
B00005A3KS|1.0|Fox Home Video messed up again... Like they did with their European release of Point Break released a year ago. I am a huge Point Break fan and I know this movie by heart.. I know every detail. So when I bought the DVD I thought something was missing, so I dug out my old Point Break on VHS  ( 4:3 format )... NOOOO !! WHAT HAVE THEY DONE !!! THOSE INCOMPETENT.... They had actually cut approx. 1/3 of the movie format by adding black lines to make it look like Wide screen enhanced... Again... Like they did with the European version.  Do NOT buy this crap!!! If somebody at FOX reads this, Can I please have my money back?
B00000K19E|5.0|I lvoed the matrix, saw it several times in the theater alone. What more can be said--great original story, great special effects, great acting, great action...I only wish that Hollywood would produce more movies like this instead of sticking with the &quot;safe&quot; stuff that they've been clinging to for the past few years.
6305041156|5.0|I was skeptical before viewing this movie, doubting if Shakespeare's &quot;King Lear&quot; could be told effectively in the Japanese rendition.  I am pleasantly surprised by the outcome &amp; now starting to appreciate &amp; respect why many of Akira Kurosawa's works are declared as silver screen masterpieces.  The spectacle is superb, probably on-par with Ben Hur, Gladiator, Braveheart.  Considering that this movie was made in 1985, Akira's achievement is hard to fault.  Many movies these days are drowned by special effects overkill but &quot;Ran&quot; has a soul.  Towards the end, I couldn't help but overwhelmed by this fastidiously directed movie, by none other than Akira Kurosawa.  I'm converted, indeed.  Highly recommended &amp; a must-have collector's piece.
0060916540|5.0|This is the kind of book you find yourself thinking about long after the final page.  I picked it while vacationing at the foot of the Matterhorn in Zermatt, Switzerland.  Having just visited the town cemetary there, I was sobered by the many graves of those that had died on that mountain. I wanted a glimpse of what goes on in the minds of climbers and why they do what they do. In Touching the Void, the author gave me glimpse into this world by articulately explaining his feelings during the planning, ascent and descent. For a nonclimber, the technical climbing descriptions can be hard at first but I think ultimately added to the story. It gives you a feel for the constant life and death decisions these men are making. However, the most compelling thing about this book, and what keeps you turning the pages long into the night,is the moral and human delimmas the climbers face when everything starts to go wrong. This book will incite much reflection and leave no doubt in your mind that the will to live is nearly indomitable.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|One of the great musicals I've seen. A feast for the eyes and ears. An underworld where love is for sale and the poet falls in love in a tragic way and finds himself separated from his love. Very, very visual film that can not be missed!
6304474652|3.0|It is a really sweet story but it i longer than i want to sit
0137549202|5.0|I found this book to be an excellent fundamental text about DSP. But is it a good introductory book for beginners? Well, it depends... The book covers the essential topics in great depth and that means every one of its 800+ pages is packed with concepts and details and examples. The style is clear, but the amount of information can be a little overwhelming when you read it for the first time. If you have time, patience, a good maths background, the desire to master the subject, and someone to clarify your doubts, this can be the best first book on DSP you could ever buy. If you just want to learn the basics, and don't have much time or patience you should probably look elsewhere.
0788811355|5.0|This is, by far, the best movie that Hollywood has produced since, possibly, &quot;The Godfather.&quot; I know that I sound snobby saying this--but here goes: &quot;The English Patient&quot; is a movie that will be greatly admired by book lovers and intellectuals(I am the former), but not by those who like movies with car chases and strip club scenes. It is a complex movie that slowly reveals itself. The story line, the cinematography, the acting, the love affair--all are top notch.It is a spellbinding movie.
B000002L68|4.0|This may not be the best Prince album to everyone (at least not to me), but everyone should own a copy of it in some form. You can't go wrong here. You got your number 1's (&quot;When Doves Cry&quot;, &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot;), your hit songs (&quot;I Would Die 4 U&quot;, &quot;Purple Rain&quot;(personal #1)), a ballad (&quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot;), and even some sex (&quot;Darling Nikki&quot;). An excellent album!!
B00003CXDZ|4.0|Like the ficticious stage production the characters in this movie are trying to get produced, this outlandish, eye-popping film is truely &quot;spectacular!&quot;  Why?  Because it has everything I love in a movie; music, dance, colourful sets and tales of far away exotic places, and an attractive and endearing couple involved in a tragic tale of love.  I was very impressed by the performances of both Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kiddman, as they sang the songs themselves in the film. Dubbing the voices would have left us feeling detached from our &quot;heros.&quot;  So Bravo Mr. Luhrmann, for doing it right!  The music, a strange mix akin to &quot;Broadway meets Nirvana at the Metropolitan Opera,&quot; was brilliant.  Everything from Madonna (luv herrrr!), Phil Collins, The Beatles, and Fat Boy Slim to name but a few, have been fused into a music smorgasboard the likes of which have never been seen before.  McGreggor who plays Christian, a Bohemian writer, who adheres to the values of truth, freedom, beauty, and above all else LOVE, falls in love with Satine, played by Kiddman, a courtesan in the Moulin Rouge club of old Paris.  She is forced between staying with Christian (for love), or going with the evil Duke, who is financing her show &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular!&quot; A classic story that everybody can enjoy, Moulin is by far the most beautiful and original movie I've seen in years.  The strange, fast-pace of the film early on was difficult to focus on, but it soon subsided to a more pleasing pace.  That same rapid editing also robbed the audience of the chance to really see and enjoy the Moulin &quot;Can Can&quot; scene.  This was however, the only flaw I could find in an otherwise perfect modern musical.
B00003CXA4|5.0|The movie gives an  exceptional potray of Mahatma Gandhi, The father of India.

B00005B4GU|1.0|this is hard to swallow.  it is difficult to believe these are the same guys who made the bends and ok computer, two mind-boggling albums.  kid a just barely got by with a few really solid cuts.  but this...this is not right...i can only shake my head and hope they stick together and make some more real albums in the future. this is bad joke! pyramid song and the video are good, i'll admit that and i like track number one as well.  but i think that is about it. and a few of the other songs may turn out to be passable but cetainly not up to radiohead standards.<br />don't get me wrong, i love radiohead.  i really do, i think they are amazing, in fact i just paid a nice chunk of change for good seats at their concert.  but if they played not a single song from this album, i would be relieved.  that is all..
0780020685|5.0|I watched this movie last night and it is even better than I first did 10 years ago. There are so many &quot;first&quot; in this movie. Almost every cinematic technique and trick known to men were used by Kurosawa in this movie. To the incredibly ignorant and uninformed reviewer from Palm Beach who claims Seven Samurai is a &quot;not bad&quot; copy of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;: Would you PLEASE withdraw your review (because you made a serious mistake, not that you don't rate it 5)? It's becoming a laughing stock here!
B000001GPX|5.0|This is definitely the best recording of the 5th I have ever heard.  This performance sounds to me like what Beethoven would have wanted.  And, the recording quaility is excellent.  You can hear all the sections clearly.<br />The 7th is excellent as well.  I haven't heard any other versions with which to compare it.
B00005B4GU|4.0|there's not much to wonder about here.  if you liked &quot;kid a&quot; you'll almost certainly like its counterpart, &quot;amnesiac&quot;.  there's a striking similarity between the two (obviously, since they were recorded in the same timeframe) as evident in the jazz ensemble from &quot;life in a glasshouse&quot; and &quot;the national anthem&quot;, the rehashing of &quot;morning bell&quot; and the electronic weirdness of &quot;pulk/pull revolving doors&quot; and &quot;kid a&quot;.  as others have mentioned, you can find a track equivalent of each &quot;amnesiac&quot; song on &quot;kid a&quot;.  the music and lyrics, once again, are at times fraught with paranoia (sound familiar?), sometimes too obscure and pretentious for their own good (see &quot;like spinning plates&quot;), and occasionally blissful and beautiful, as in &quot;pyramid song&quot;.  in short, there isn't too much that's new and different here, which is surprising since that's something that radiohead seems to have prided itself on in the last few years.  if &quot;knives out&quot; sounds eerily like &quot;paranoid android&quot; to you, then you've got the idea.  the stupidly named &quot;packt like sardines in a crushd tin box&quot;, aside from being pretentious once again, is a good opening track with its intriguing kettle pounding and throbbing bassline.  &quot;i might be wrong&quot; is probably the most interesting and best track on the album, as it has a menacing feel and a catchy, almost danceable riff that pervades nearly the entire song.  it's a nice touch.  thom yorke's vocals aren't quite as whiny and annoying as they are on much of the rest of the record's tunes.  for all of the critiques you can make about this album, though, there is much to be said about how well it's done, even if it is &quot;kid a&quot; leftovers.  some of the material is tough to swallow at first, but it's hard to argue it doesn't flow well.  radiohead continues to make intelligent and difficult music, which gives them a license to have a few hit-or-miss &quot;experiments&quot;.  what it comes down to though, is what you thought of &quot;kid a&quot;.  base your purchase of &quot;amnesiac&quot; on that and probably that alone.  the hype about this being &quot;more commercial&quot; and &quot;guitar-oriented&quot; isn't really justified.  nonetheless, it's another score for radiohead.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements, a Toltec Wisdom Book presents a strong foundation for living a life of your own choosing.  All four agreements are sound advice.  The third agreement &quot;don't make assumptions&quot; is a potent tool for living in the moment, whereby you leave your past judgments behind and experience life directly, moment to moment.  I especially found the fourth agreement &quot;don't take anything personally&quot; to be very freeing.  I started to pay attention to how much I was taking other people's words or ways of being personally without investigating where the words or actions were coming from.  I found I had more energy and incentive to be responsible for my own words and actions and not for those of others around me.<br />     Another book I highly suggest reading is called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane. While The Four Agreements presents rules or guidelines for living your life, the Kanes present a way of being in your life.  Their approach is based on the premise that through listening and simple, non judgmental awareness, you can lead a meaningful and enriching life instantaneously.  And it works!  <br />     Both of these books are great sources for creating your own heavenly life here on earth.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Apparently recorded/assembled while Kid A was recorded, Amnesia has the feel of a record cobbled together from random tracks.  Lacking the cohesiveness and hypnotic pull of Kid A, Amnesia is successful, but not as successful as its predecessor.  Pyramid Song and I Might Be Wrong are almost redolent of a time when Radiohead didn't disdain guitars, while Packt Like Sardines...is reminscent of Kid A's best tracks.  But taken as a whole, Amnesia doesn't measure up to Kid A and the pieces fit together less coherently.  The end result is a feeling that their current sound, the electronic textures used at the exclusion of guitars, feels played out and even a bit stale.  Kid A sounded fresh and new; Amnesia is a variation on a theme.  A great theme mind you, but a variation nonetheless.
B00004U30D|5.0|I am surprised that there are so many negative reviews of this great movie. This movie is great. What does the viewer from Evanston mean, &quot;art high and low&quot;? I don't think this rips off anything. (And could the viewer say &quot;film&quot; any more times?) If there is any truth in saying that American Beauty gives the viewer both art AND trash, which I guess it does, the movie is saying that both of these things make America great. Kevin Spacey is GOD. It's a shame that more people don't see it because it's saying that sometimes garbage can be beautiful. I mean, at first you think that the two teenagers are going to kill the father but then they don't. That's real American Beauty.
B00004WGAI|5.0|I was totally taken with this version of Jane Eyre.  There is such contrast between Clarke and Dalton that makes the story so interesting. I've watched this video several times and consider it one of my favorites.  If you like a good love story as well as interesting characters I recommend this video.
1878424319|1.0|What many reviewers praise as the \\"simplicity\\" of this title strikes me as simple-mindedness.<br />The author asserts that all of us are dreaming (24/7!) a small part of one big planetwide dream. If we can free ourselves of the \\"domestication\\" imposed upon us by parents, relationships, responsibilities, etc., and re-create our \\"framework\\" (which is a four-part \\"domestication\\" of its own) then we can make the dream come alive for ourselves.<br />I'm sorry, but the philosophy dispensed by this mercifully thin volume flows freely at many sixteen-year-olds' parties, and is often more coherent and interesting there. If you don't crave encouragement in blaming your parents and your other failed relationships for your own shortcomings, then this book may not be for you. If you're suspicious of the idea that a great society is comprised of billions of individuals rejecting codes of behaviour in favour of their own \\"don't worry, be happy\\" impulses, then you're going to be disturbed by this book.<br />The four \\"agreements\\" are (1) Be impeccable with your word, (2) Don't take anything personally, (3) Don't make assumptions and (4) Always do your best. They are printed on the flyleaf. I waded 2/3 of the way through the book before realizing that I could have stopped at the flyleaf.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has definitely mellowed and matured, resulting in the best album I've bought in years.  This material is intricate; after several listenings, it gets under the skin. Excellent work.
B00005IBGQ|4.0|\\"Poses\\" is the first exposure I have heard from Rufus Wainwright. I only picked up a copy of \\"Poses\\" is because I have heard such good things about Rufus as an artist and how some people were anticipating to buy this album. The first time I listened to this cd was at work, where I can't really listen to music very loud, so basically I didn't know what to make of Rufus Wainwright. Now that I have listened to \\"Poses\\" at home, now I know what to make of him.<br />I really enjoyed \\"Poses\\" both musically and lyrically. There is a biting humor to the songs here on \\"Poses\\", for example \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk\\" which delves into the songwriter's personal vices. With a title like \\"In A Graveyard\\", one would think that it would be a morbid ballad when in actual reality it is more charming than morbid. There are a couple of songs on the album that I thought were only so-so but overall I really did enjoy \\"Poses\\" immensely.
B00005B4GU|5.0|In a world of throw-away commercial artists, Radiohead continues to amaze with quality releases.  While I'm not a big fan of Pablo Honey, the rest of their collection gets heavy airplay in my CD collection.  Amnesiac is going and has already gotten, maximum play.  I listened to the entire album on the net at least 5 times, and bought the album today.  Now on my 3rd listening of this, it's a keeper folks.  The album starts great and keeps an even keel throughout.  Stand-out tracks to me would include &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; (which is a very good video also), &quot;You and Whose Army&quot;, &quot;Knives Out&quot;, &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot;, and &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot;.  The rest of the album is not just filler either.  The album flows in to each song very well as if it was a concept album.  How many artists can you name were you can listen to the entire album and not want to hit the skip button at least once?  While it doesn't have all the experimental aspects of a Kid A or the electronic feel of OK Computer, it falls in a happy medium of sorts.  The album has a very warm almost acoustical sound to it, with the organ and guitars.  The songwriting is the bands strongest forte, and they display their collective talents here again. If you're a fan, you already have it or have it coming in the mail.  If you wonder what Radiohead is all about, this is as good of an album to sink into. Now, if they'll only tour somewhere in the midwest U.S., anywhere close, please I'm willing to travel.
B000002JS8|5.0|I think that is is one of the greatest cd's by my favorite rock band in history (even though I'm only 13).  This is an essential cd if you are intrested in AC/DC music, mainly because it features Bon Scott, who is scores more talented than the current singer that Brian Johnson.  The best tracks on the cd are; Highway to Hell, Girls got Rythm, and If you want Blood You Got it (AC/DC's best song ever, in my opinion) but all the songs are worth listening to.  BUY THIS CD.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is definitely not KID A, or KID B....&quot;Amnesiac&quot; is even more strange than KID A, even though they both came from the same sessions. There is another version of &quot;Morning Bell&quot; with a feeling of impending doom attached to it. &quot;Life In A Glass House&quot; has horns and feels like a drunken jazz song. &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; isn't like anything you have ever heard from Radiohead. &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, you probably heard on the radio, and is the only track on the CD that can be played on air. It's the only rock track. &quot;Amnesiac&quot; may alienate some fans. It is such a far cry from &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, and from anything else they've done. But I do think that true fans, and people who appreciate beautiful music will love it.
B000002MFN|5.0|Bad timing [messed] \\"Erotica\\" (pun intended). In my opinion, this is Madonna's most confessional, intimate album yet. And I don't mean intimate in a sexual way, though several of the songs have sexual themes. Rather, I get the feeling that she wasn't going for the catchy single as much as for songs about herself and the place she was at in her life. Listening to \\"Erotica\\" makes me feel like I'm taking a step into Madonna's consciousness. This album was underrated, I think, because it was released at the same time as the book SEX, sooooo...<br />A lot of the tracks on this disc are pretty heavy - themes include the death of friends, infidelity, dissatisfaction with self, etc - but that makes them more powerful and meaningful, in my opinion. But it's still Maddy, so of course you can dance.<br />My favorite songs are \\"Bye Bye Baby\\", \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Bad Girl\\", \\"Waiting\\", \\"Words\\", and \\"In This Life\\", which is arguably the most powerful ballad in this collection.<br />\\"Erotica\\" is an essential album for any Madonna fan. You won't regret this purchase.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|&quot;Poses&quot; is much more subtle than his debut album, which was very bold, to the extreme at some times. Nothing wrong with that, by the way. As much as I like his debut, &quot;Poses&quot; makes for much easier listening. I don't see any of the tracks making it to the radio, but in my opinion, that's a good thing.
B00005B4GU|2.0|I was not particularly pleased with Kid A. I'm even less pleased with Amnesiac. What happened to the band that gave us Ok Computer and The Bends??? If you felt, as I did, that Kid A was a drab and ultimately boring effort; you'll want to save your money. There is only one, actually good, song on this album, &quot;Knives Out&quot;. Worth it for that song alone? Probably not. A couple other tunes are somewhat interesting, but would have been better as B-sides.  I suggest you buy a used copy. Hordes of let down Radiohead fans will surely be depositing their copy of Amnesiac at your local used record store. With the money you'll save you can buy the new Travis...
B00005B4GU|4.0|As long as I have been a Radiohead fan, I have been rewarded with cutting edge, varied and interesting music. Every time they issue a new album, I am impressed with the new direction and their ability to push the envelope. I give Amnesiac 4 stars rather than 5, because I don't think the album is complete (for reference I give OK Computer 5 stars). The way I see it, and from what I hear least one bad member thinks, the Kid A sessions produced enough music for one extra long album, not 2. Amanesiac has better songs than Kid A, but Kid A is a little more comprehensive top to bottom. I feel that Amnesiac has to many non vocal and filler songs, but between Kid A and Amnesiac, I think Amesiac has better songs. This doesn't mean I wouldn't buy it, as a matter of fact, I was officailly the first person to purchase it at my local record store. I also bought a second copy from Amazon.
B0000524CY|5.0|Re-released 27 years later, one of the greatest horror films of all-time is still deeply unnerving.  Much has been made about the new &quot;director's cut&quot;, that the newly-included, never-before-seen footage detracts from the original rather than adds.  It is true that the film's epilogue is dragged out for no apparent reason but that is not a significant enough reason to keep people from watching it again.  It's simply one of the best films around.
6302800420|5.0|Dustin Hoffman is Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels in this classic comedy.  Michael Dorsey was an unemployed actor for 20 years.  One day when Michael's girlfriend, Sandy,(Teri Garr) tries out for a soap opera and doesn't make it Michael tries out for the part as Dorothy Michaels and gets the part.  Everything from wedding proposals to falling in love with a female co-star on the show named Julie(Jessica Lang) Sydney Pollock directs and co-stars in this brilliant comedy the will have you laughing the whole time.  A defiant classic and must-have.
B00003CXE7|3.0|I do not typically what action flicks so it's been a long time I've seen something this good.  And despite the overly familiar plot, I was roped in and found myself rooting like a little boy for General Maximus.  I've also observed that people who've seen &quot;Spartacus&quot; are less enamoured by &quot;Gladiator&quot; than those who've yet to experience the Kubrick sword &amp; sandal epic.  Another quibble with &quot;Gladiator&quot; is that I wished the actual fighting sequences in the coliseum weren't so disjointed and muddled.  I couldn't follow much of the fight sequences, and they made me really appreciate the talents of, say, Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan, whose choreographed action sequences are always displayed fully on the screen, sans quick-cut editing and camera trickery.  White folks still have a bunch to learn from us.
B000000XCD|5.0|Although it lacks as many recognizable radio hits that dominate &quot;Cosmo's Factory&quot;, this is probably the album with their BEST songs overall. The opening title track was a radio hit and is followed by the heartpounding &quot;Commotion&quot; and then the great &quot;Tombstone Shadow&quot;. More good stuff is here in &quot;Lodi&quot;, &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;, and &quot;Wrote a Song for Everyone&quot;.
B00003CXFV|3.0|It's &quot;A Civil Action&quot; but instead of John Travolta, we get Julia Roberts wearing tight, slinky, cantilevered outfits.  I must admit I really enjoyed watching Roberts but besides her wardrobe, there is really nothing in this movie that I haven't seen before.  It is well done considering that the film had to conform to both the genre and the facts of the true story it was based upon.  Soderbergh also comes through with some nice scenes, particularly the opening sequence that sets up the movie.
0792151712|1.0|I thought this was the most stupid movie ever made.  Seriously.  It made me cry a lot.  But, maybe this was because my mom wouldn't let me out of the theater so I could get away from that monstrosity.  I hated this movie. It had a cheap, not down-to-earth love (if you could call it love, more like a one night stand) story, and stupid &quot;special effects.&quot; The only reason why I gave it one star was because it ended.
B000056K04|4.0|Traditional Dave Matthews Band fans will find this album very different with a much more 'produced' sound. While I still prefer his older work and attitude (as I think he does as well) this album is still good compared to most other pop-rock albums out there. Don't pass it by because it is different.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Carlos Santana has been around a long time, and put out an immense amount of great music.  This tops them all, simply because he reaches out to the young stars today and adds their voices to his searing signature guitar style.  A MUST HAVE to anyone who has followed his career through the years.
B000002AS3|5.0|Noel Gallagher has called &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; the best debut album of ALL TIME. Pretty bold for him to say, obviously, but he's not that far off.<br />This album is a classic in every sense of the word. Every song is great, from &quot;Rock 'n Roll Star&quot;, one of best openers I've ever heard, to the incredibly beautiful &quot;Slide Away&quot;. <br />Definitely (there's that word again!) buy this album. I'd give it 10 stars if they'd let me.
B000007MVD|5.0|This delightful 2CD historical document stemmed from the popular &quot;Beatles At The Beeb&quot; syndicated radio show, drawn from the band's 1962-65 live appearances for the British Broadcasting Corporation. It was as close as the world's best known rock and roll band came to a surprise hit, selling more than four million copies at Christmas 1994. This surprised label executives and  surviving members, opening the floodgates for 1995-96's &quot;Anthology&quot; book, CD, and video series. It even encouraged the BBC to release similar revelatory sets from a generation's classic rockers (Bowie, Hendrix, Kinks, Who, Yardbirds, Zeppelin).<br />&quot;Live At The BBC&quot; thrilled new and longtime fans by reprising the Beatles at their early, cohesive, rocking best, months off their first hits and grueling Hamburg club apprenticeship.  You hear exhilirating high energy and hilarity double-poured into the group's musical and show business influences. They acknowledge the Coasters (&quot;Young Blood&quot; ), Brill Building pop (&quot;I Just Don't Understand,&quot; &quot;Baby It's You,&quot; a low-fi, scintillating &quot;Keep Your Hands Off My Baby&quot;) Tin Pan Alley (&quot;Taste of Honey,&quot; &quot;Till There Was You&quot;), Chuck Berry (six songs including a rollicking &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; and a sloppy &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; ) and Little Richard (&quot;Ooh! My Soul,&quot; Paul's wails on &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;).<br />The Beatles also acknowledged the criminally underrated Arthur Alexander (a polished &quot;Soldier of Love,&quot; &quot;A Shot Of Rhythm and Blues&quot;) and Sun rockabilly (&quot;That's All Right Mama,&quot; George's Carl Perkins fixation on &quot;Honey Don't&quot; and &quot;Matchbox&quot;). Even then these were knowing, detailed cover songs which, played night upon night on tour, sharpened the musical personality of arguably music's ultimate hybrid band. No surprise they surrounded the hits on the group's first LPs.<br />As &quot;Live At The BBC&quot; progresses, the Beatles slowly possess the world over and above their native Britain. A welcome radio showcase becomes patriotism and due diligence by road and fame-weary superstars. You get fewer songs overall, more Lennon-McCartney compositions (&quot;Things We Said Today,&quot; &quot; Ticket To Ride,&quot; &quot;She's A Woman&quot;) and, thankfully, originals they never recorded in studio (&quot;I'll Be On My Way&quot;). The playing sounds closer to the studio recordings, with &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot;'s piano solo lifted from the session tape (even with humorous asides).<br />The surviving Beatles and their fans had much to celebrate after this well-annotated set's success. The &quot;Anthology&quot; series (each reaching #1 within 12 months) toured Beatle backroads of history and studio craft, while &quot;1&quot;'s monstrous success took their story full circle. As the group's late publicist, Derek Taylor, concluded, &quot;If you weren't there, than welcome now and if you haven't heard this music, please do so and know that life is indeed still good.&quot; Those words stand for those missing in 1994 or 1964; &quot;Live At The BBC&quot; is essential and available, a gleeful, nostalgic must-own.ive At The BBC&quot; progresses, the Beatles slowly possess the world over and above their native Britain.

1577311523|5.0|This book really does teach how to practice the Presence. I have found since starting it that I can remain without  thoughts for 20 min or so.  Feels good.
B000059TPN|5.0|This is absolutely an amazing film. Dont' miss it for the world. Excellent music my Hans Zimmer, too.
0875428940|5.0|This tarot deck is absolutely beautiful.  As a Pagan, I found the symbolism of these cards especially meaningful to me.  They are comfortable to hold and shuffle.  I have small hands and it is hard to find cards that I can hold easily, this deck is just perfect.  The pictures are bright and colorful.  I can't keep my hands off this deck.
B000002IWH|4.0|This CD rocks!  Is captures perfectly the atmosphere of The Crow movie.  Listening to this CD will send you on the same rollercoaster ride of ups, downs, twists, and turns as watching the film.  Most definitely worth buying.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|Where is the song &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;? The movie uses the fantastic song by Queen, but it's not on the soundtrack. And the Lady Marmalade remake is a joke. Sure the actual words didn't quite fit the movie, but did you have to use Christina? Ugh.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It is something I have never experienced before, very unique movie. It was like seeing Broadway on the big screen. I really enjoyed the music and the scenery.  I loved Ewan's character, which he portrayed very well. Perfect for the part. Nicole's performance was excellent also.
B00005B4GU|5.0|i have to say, it isnt ok computer. but it isnt a bad thing, just as it wasnt a bad thing on kid a. i thoroughly enjoyed the album, in all its synth distorted glory. i do sort of miss radiohead the rock band, but this is a welcome change that im going to support for as long as the band does.
B000007MVD|3.0|&quot;The Beatles - Live at the BBC&quot;, containing recordings done by the Fab Four for the BBC during the years 1962-1965, provides an interesting perspective on John, Paul, George and Ringo, when they were still a bunch of young and ambitious friends, who just got together to play some rock'n'roll and impress the ladies, way before Lennon decided to change the world and McCartney decided to write enough sweet love songs to fill a candy store.<br />The recordings in the double album are mostly cover versions of r'n'r and r'n'b standards by the artists the Beatles liked - Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Larry Williams, Carl Perkins, and the rest. Here and there some of their early original hits (Love Me Do, Can't Buy Me Love, Ticket To Ride, and more).<br />The performances are strong and vigorous. John and Paul scream their lungs out, George's guitar imitates Chuck Berry quite well, and Ringo keeps the steady beat. They sound like they're trying to convince England that they're the best band in the world. They did manage to do that eventually.<br />All in all, not an album for everyone. People who look for all the famous songs from their later period - Let It Be, Hey Jude, Strawberry Fields Forever - will be disappointed. There is nothing psychedelic or experimental about these recordings - it's pure rock'n'roll.<br />If you're not (yet) a big Beatles fan, I recommend you'd start by buying one of their classic studio albums - Help!, Sgt. Pepper's or Abbey Road. However, if you already own most of the Beatles' material and you want to hear different Beatles - young, innocent and full of appreciation to the r'n'r legends of the '50s - this is an album for you.<br />One last note - due to the fact that these recordings were taken off radio sessions, the sound quality is so-so. Most of the songs sound good, but it's not what you're used to hear on studio albums.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I bought this CD on the day it came out. I had heard it before, so I knew what to expect, but the high sound quality was new(the leaked MP3s were terrible). To put it simply, it blew me away.<br />  Each of Radiohead's CDs in the past has had a certain feel. Pablo Honey and The Bends were conventional, yet amazing, albums. Compare them to OK Computer and Kid A, both concept albums, which felt like watching a movie or reading a book. I've tried to invent stories to go with those albums. Then there's the difference between OKC and Kid A. OKC is very down to earth. There are plenty of lyrics, emotion, etc. Kid A is something different. The lyrics seem to be coming from some other worldly place. The songs now can better be described as soundscapes. There's less emotion, yet just as much power. Amnesiac rests in the middle of all of this. It carries a variety of emotions and images, like The Bends and Pablo Honey, yet it flows as well as OKC and Kid A. It seems more earthly than Kid A, yet less earthly than OKC. For beginners, this and OK Computer are the best Radiohead CDs. And here's my song by song review....<br />   Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box - Very good song. Sounds like anything off of Kid A(sort of like an EIRP-Idioteque-Kid A blend), yet has OKC-style lyrics.<br />   Pyramid Song - Amazing. An egyptian-style piano line, combined with jazzy drums and a powerful string arrangement. <br />   Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors - Hands down, the strangest thing Radiohead has ever done, rivaling even OK Computer's Fitter Happier. And it works, too! A lot of people slag this song off, but I personally find it quite cool!<br />   You And Whose Army? - An excellent, OK Computer-style ballad. Apparently this is a great live song too.<br />   I Might Be Wrong - By far Radiohead's best upbeat song. Rocks harder than anything since Pablo Honey, yet loses no emotion or beauty. <br />   Knives Out - I'm guessing that this single is gonna be as big of a hit as Creep was. Ithas way more general appeal than anything they've done since Pablo Honey. Centers on a beautiful, haunting guitar solo.<br />   Morning Bell/Amnesiac - Very interesting. This track was not included because Radiohead was out of stuff to use. It was put here to provide a link to Kid A. While I like the Kid A version better, this is a very good arrangement, and has more power when looked at in context to the rest of Amnesiac and Kid A.<br />   Dollars And Cents - Quite possibly my favorite song off of Amnesiac. Sounds like the string and guitar version of Kid A's National Anthem. Translation: it freaks out.<br />   Hunting Bears - Some people call this track filler. What they fail to notice is how beautiful it is. It's a guitar intrumental, with keyboards backing it up. Quite good.      Like Spinning Plates - Easily the best and most outlandish experiment on Kid A and Amnesiac. The song is played backwards, even Thom Yorke's voice. Yet you can understand what he's saying. That's because they recorded it with him singing backwards, then reversed it. Very cool. I wonder if they play a reversed version live! :-)       Life In A Glass House - This track dissapointed a lot of people. That's because it wasn't what they were expecting(a powerful, beautiful ballad). However, it's a great song. An outright admittance of the jazz influence that showed on tracks such as Pyramid Song and You And Whose Army. Not to mention, a great way to end the CD!
6305903182|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out, but i wasn't satisfied i had to own it for myself. There were things that i didn't see the first time that i had the great opportunity to see once it was in my possession. The ending wasn't quite what i had expected but very good nonetheless.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead&#8217;s latest album \\"Amnesiac\\" demonstrates yet again how these musicians can masterfully dissolve the fearful barrier that lies in between our emotions and our physical creative ability.  One would assume that having to follow a monumental work like \\"Kid A\\" must have been a daunting task, but the band gracefully steps up and effortlessly knocks another one out of the park.  <br />I confess that listening to a new Radiohead album is ceremonial to me, preparations are required.  No phone, no TV (ever if possible), no distractions, just a dark quiet room, some 'erb (if you're lucky) and a good pair of headphones is all that's needed. <br />Although lacking the symphonic continuity of \\"Kid A\\" and feeling that the album groaned slightly under it's own weight toward the end, the album is another artistic and technological masterpiece. The message:  Technology is now god on our greedy little ball of dirt.  So, will our world become like Terry Gilliam's \\"Brazil\\"?  Let's hope not, or is it already too late?
0375701427|2.0|I am glad Philip Roth has his admirers; it take the pressure off me. To be fair, I liked some of his early books. I first read Goodbye, Columbus in 1977 and I still recall the sense of awe his writing gave me. He said so much with so little. Even the names of the characters were rich with significance, making it a book to read on many levels. In that slight book, Roth said tenfold more than  in the hugely overwritten and dull American Pastoral. Actually, I consider it quite an accomplishment for Roth to make a book with political terrorism in it into something so completely boring.<br />It's knowing what Roth can do that makes the vast, undiscipined logorrhea of American Pastoral so painful. If I had not been obligated to finish this book for my book group it would have been thrown across the room within Part One, probably in the third or fourth imagined conversation between Levov and his daughter Merry.  This book reads as though Roth sat down, typed without pausing and walked away, never once rereading to edit a sentence. It is self-indulgent, undisciplined and completely, almost unremittingly terrible..<br />Occasionally, Roth aspires to his old brilliance. There are flashes of true insight that are about as plentiful as the chicken  in Campbell's soup. When he writes about the drinking neighbor woman and people simply getting tired of themselves....that had a ring of truth. When he wrote about Swede sensing his wife Dawn still loved him, but was rejecting him because that could make her new -- a woman without a terrorist daughter -- that was beautifully compassionate and empathetic. But Roth was stingy with his genius in this book and most of it is a thin gruel.<br />Roth uses Zuckerman as his narrator -- a mistake, in my opinion. Zuckerman is the ultimate unreliable narrator and it's clear that the entire narrative is nothing but the product of Zuckerman's own obsessions. It reveals more about Zuckerman than Swede -- of course -- and focuses on the least interesting element of Swede's life. <br />American Pastoral is a Job-like inquiry into why bad things happen to good people -- to be specific, how did good parents like Swede and Dawn produce a daughter who was sweet and loving until adolesence and who then became a terrorist bomber.  Of course, the answer is unknowable and it takes Zuckerman forever and a day to concede that point.  A much more interesting story to me would be how does a man, who loses everything in such a horrible, soul-searing way find the courage to try again. How, after having a child go so hideously wrong, does Swede get the courage to do it over, risking disaster not once, but three times with three sons.  However, Zuckerman doesn't spend one paragraph on the question of how one finds that courage. His interest is completely absorbed in finding the one point where everything went wrong -- a fruitless,impossible quest that took altogether to many pages to accomplish.
B00005B4GU|5.0|It's often this way with Radiohead: expect the unexpected, and you'll still be surprised.  Like most twins, Amnesiac is similar to its sister album, Kid A, yet clearly has a personality all its own.  To me, almost every song sounds just like its title (the strings in Pyramid Song are reminiscent of camels in the desert, and Morning Bell/Amnesiac has a background of sleepless clock noises, for instance).  As I think most people would admit, if you are new to Radiohead it might be best to start out with an album like OK Computer or The Bends, but keep in mind that each album is a divergence from the last.  Forget the not-so-hot reviews you may have read about the album and trust that Radiohead will deliver; they do.  And prepare to be pleasantly surprised by the last track (don't skip ahead!), Life in a Glasshouse, which is in a style I would not have expected from Radiohead--but that's exactly the point.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Once again, Radiohead does the impossible: Write and record an entire disc of very listenable music.  The disc starts out with a song laden with percussion, 'Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box' and progresses to the techno-like 'Pyramid Song.' Particular highlights of the album include the rockin' slide-guitar centered 'I Might be Wrong' and the upbeat 'Knives Out.'  As all other Radiohead albums, the fantastic music is overlaid with nicely penned melodies and lyrics. The listener is easily lulled into a tranquil state by the reverb-heavy 'Dollars and Cents.'  5 stars for another fantastic Radiohead album.  A &quot;great&quot; music library would not be complete without &quot;Amnesiac.&quot;
B00000255F|5.0|I was in 8th grade.  I walked into the kitchen where my brother was reading the issue of Time magazine with Bruce on the cover.  I asked him what he was reading and he said, &quot;An article about this guy,&quot; pointing to my parents home entertainment center.<br />I can't remember which song was playing, but I do remember that in that single instant I realized what music was all about.  That this is what music should sound like.<br />More than 25 years later, I still feel the same way.  This album is part of my life.  It defined music's past, present and future when I was thirteen.  It was the first gift I ever gave my wife when we started dating in high school.  It prompted our first kiss (a long story.)  I have listened to it thousands of times and I still get goosebumps every time I put it on.  Now I have a 13-year old son of my own who is aspiring to be the next Mighty Max, and it has become one of his favorites.<br />Whether you are 50 or 15, you should own this album.  It is the perfect mix of poetry and musicianship.  Anger and compassion.  Confusion and clarity.  Bruce has said that when he started Born to Run he set out to create the greatest rock and roll album of all time.  He wanted Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and Roy Orbison's tenderness.  When you hear the title track's Wall of Guitars layered with drums, horns, keyboards and a glockenspeil you know he achieved the former.  And the visual picture he paints when he sings &quot;The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves, like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays, Roy Orbison singing for the lonely ...&quot; had to make ol' Roy smile.<br />This is simply as good as it gets!
B00005B4GU|5.0|It's hard to compare one Radiohead album to another, they have a tendancy to never repeat themselves, which in this case is a good thing. Kid A had a lot of potential, and was rewarding if you made an effort at listening to it numerous times, there weren't any easy listeners on it, that's the major difference between the Kid and Amnesiac. Where Kid A was a real deviation from their guitar driven sound, Amnesiac has a more calm sedated sound - still retaining some of the experimentation that went on during the Kid A sessions combined with guitar riffs and more of Thoms clear and passionate vocal. Pyramid song stands out as the most radio friendly song on the album, its mix of mellow ambient sounds and distant rythm. The rough sounds of 'Packt like sardines...' are suppressed by Pyramid song only to be resurrected by 'pulk/pull...', all in all the songs on Amnesiac have the same dreamy sensation to them that Kid As songs had, but the weirdness that is Kid A has been toned down, making Amnesiac a more accepted album that is sure to please both OK computer fans, as well as Kid A fans.
B00004NRUM|4.0|Marillion with Fish made only excellent records. With the new Marillion every second record is excellent. This one of the best ones.
B00005214X|5.0|This album is absolutely wonderful. It would be excellent for any Rock and Roll fan. After hearing this album it kind of makes sense why Harrison would have wanted to leave The Beatles with all this terrific material. <br />To me every song is a delight, but &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;(Awesome guitar in this one), &quot;Isn't it a Pity&quot;, and &quot;Let it Down&quot; are standouts on the first disc. &quot;Apple Scruffs&quot;, &quot;Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp&quot;, and &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; are the best tracks on the second disc. All the songs are a joy to listen to though for sure.<br />The Jams at the end of the second disc are pretty good as well especially if you like guitar solos. Eric Clapton played in many of the Jams and some of the songs on the album.<br />The last thing I will brag about is the packaging. I've heard people say it's hard to get the discs out, but it's not difficult at all. The box is very unique with a soft texture that I've never seen on CD packaging before.<br />This album is a definite buy for any music fan. I almost want to buy it twice.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I got to see this movie while on a business trip in Pittsburgh over the weekend.  I was blown away at Nicole Kidman's voice.  While she is no prodigy vocally - she is believable and sells each song with much heart.  While there are many songs from this soundtrack that are fresh - my favorite was the duet between McGregor and Kidman, &quot;Come What May&quot;.  It is written in such a manner than you really begin to feel the love on the screen.  I laughed so hard at the &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; duet with the &quot;Be Our Guest/Hello Dolly&quot;-like production number I almost wet my pants.  This movie is a must see - but  must see for the big screen.  I will own it for myself once it comes out but I cant wait to get back to the theater to see it again.  Im sure I will see things I missed the first time.  I did with this movie like I do most - walk in expecting nothing and I walked away with a newfound respect for Kidman and a new favorite director in Luhrman.  Good work folks!
0618135871|4.0|This is my first experience with Mr. Roth's work. For those who like their Authors to shine bright lights on any space containing thoughts that may be uncomfortable, outrageous, and offensive to some, this is a writer you can count on. Nothing he wrote offended me, however I would not suggest reading this book during a meal.<br />Others have dissected the more complex nuances of this work, and I will leave that area to those who were part of the 60's decade. I found the book extremely well done, with dialogue as good as any I have read. A 70-year-old professor that plays Schubert and then nostalgically muses about Jimmy Hendrix reversed guitar riffs, takes a bit of getting used to. His obsession with women is not shocking, however his ability to objectify a woman at the most outrageously inappropriate moments can be labeled brutally candid, or severely unbalanced.<br />There is much that can be commented on but I particularly enjoyed the Author when he had his players go off on some rant. The Professor explaining his status as a Karamazov Father to his Son was great. His friend George when counseling his friend and his despair regarding Consuela was outrageously witty. And then of course the Professor proclaiming his is pro-choice for her, unless of course it interferes with a loved one. The Professor's use of our Constitution to enlighten his rather dim Son was hilarious. And if there has been a better condemnation of Cuba under Castro I have yet to read it.<br />Fascinating Author who creates memorable and complex characters, who also repeatedly goes farther off a limb than most would dare, and gets away with it.<br />Very interesting work.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac is a collection of really beautiful songs. From the opening ketttle drum to the closing horn this album will take hold and won't let go. Amnesiac has a certain warmth that Kid A doesn't. If you liked Kid A you will like Amnesiac. Buy it now!
B00005B4GU|5.0|When KID A was released, part of the buzz (from the band and their record company) was that it's experimentalism would be followed by a &quot;rock guitar&quot; album.... Now, we learn that AMNESIAC was recorded at the exact same time as KID A, which was planned originally to be a double album! Well, this makes sense, because the ironically-titled AMNESIAC (I guess we are supposed to forget about that &quot;rock guitar&quot; thing) is totally of a piece with KID A - Indeed, if anything, it's LESS accessible and song-oriented than it's predecessor....<br />In other words - the music on AMNESIAC is brilliant, but don't expect a return to THE BENDS, or you'll be very disappointed....
0679601686|5.0|If you like this kind of story...<br />Pride and Prejudice is the best relationship story I have ever read.  There have been many off-springs, sequels, movies etc. in the tradition of P&amp;P.  Jane Austen is the master of interpersonal relationships and her tales take us back to a gentle era where things not being equal, women have to make the most of whatever situation they are born into.  Austen introduces us to Elizabeth Bennett, a strong woman who is a devoted sister and daughter and very honest with her heart. She has become one of my favorite heroines in Literature not only because of her heart, but also for her ability to grow.  One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book was watching as the main characters are transformed throughout the telling.  Mr. Darcy, who is perhaps one of the more idealized men in fiction, recognizes his weaknesses through Elizabeth and she in turn learns from him.<br />The cast of characters are some of Austen's most unforgettable.  Mr. Collins the dim-witted cousin who thinks he is quite a pious man and a good catch for any women. The annoyingly cheeky Lydia, Mrs. Bennett the nagging mother with not much upstairs, but good intentions none the less, and many more.  They all held my interest throughout the book and left me wanting more of them.  I highly recommend this book to be read and re-read many times.  You will see how great characters are developed and a great relationship is formed.
B000002LIX|4.0|With former members of Janes Addiction and Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist, Flea, rejoining forces for a reunion tour this summer, Ritual de lo Habitual is the perfect album to help listeners reacquaint themselves with the modern rock band that rocked air waves and music charts during the late 80s and early 90s. Ritual de lo Habitual is a well-rounded album that contains two of Janes Addiction's biggest hits, Stop! and Been Caught Stealing.  Althought this album packs a punch that will appeal to any fan of high-energy rock  n' roll it also contains songs like Three days that reveal the softer more reflective side of the band. Ritual de lo Habitual is a free-spirited album that would be the perfect sound track for a summer road trip or a backyard barbeque.
0375501851|5.0|Although White Teeth has been somewhat forgotten behind a haze of media glitter and hype, this book demands attention simply as a quirky and quite brilliant first novel. Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal forge an enduring friendship over an extended period of cowardice during World War Two, and when they both begin families late in life, their respective children Irie, and Magid and Millat become intertwined in the melting pot that is North London. Add in the Chalfens, an English family with a righteous, alomost (benevolently) colonial temperament, and this fiery mix of personalities provides the crux for Smith's imaginative exploration of prejudice, personal and cross cultural relationships, scientific experimentation and religious fundamentalism. The subplots in the novel are similarly engrossing, with enough eccentric characters to fuel several novels. To mention just a few without spoiling the story: Millat wavers between a fundamentalist Islamic sect whose initials spell KEVIN and his natural tendency toward the role of neighbourhood Godfather; Alsana, Samad's wife, earns money by making fetish outfits; and Irie finishes off her schooling with her grandmother, a vehement Jehovah's witness.  The only criticism I would make of this book is that in seeking to explore so many &quot;big issues&quot;, Smith inevitably overreaches the constraint provided by her 462 pages. However, Smith readily concedes that her work does contain flaws, impressing that, &quot;If I thought it was the best book I could write, that would be incredibly depressing.&quot; Another book, even better than White Teeth? I'll look forward to reading that.
B000002LKU|5.0|As other reviewers have written here, this is one that will grow on you. The Notting Hillbillies are Mark Knopfler, Steve Phillips, Guy Fletcher, and Brendan Croker. Fletcher plays piano, the others are guitarists. Paul Franklin is credited for pedal steel guitar, but doesn't rate a photo on the cover. Bass and drums appear on many of the songs, but no musician is credited. Knopfler is the only one of these guys I know of in any other context. The strength of the album, for me, is the beautiful guitar work, and slow easy but always tight rhythmns.<br />The album is a collection of traditionals &amp; classics arranged by the band, and some originals (only one by Knopfler). Musical styles vary from one song to the next, but the album as a whole has a bluesy folksy sound to it that just can't be beat. Vocals are mostly handled by Knopfler's 3 band mates (he sings his own composition, &quot;Your Own Sweet Way&quot; and harmonizes on some others); I can't recognize who is who, but the voices are excellent and fit perfectly into this music. Some of the songs feature nice harmonies.<br />A bit about a few of the songs: &quot;Railroad worksong&quot; is a traditional, with a bit of a bluegrass feel (including banjo); acoustic guitar, pedal steel, and Knopfler's unmistakable electric lead weaving softly through it. &quot;One Way Gal&quot; has a subdued calypso sound, with acoustic (?) slide and electric guitar. The singer reminds me of Levon Helm of The Band. &quot;Run Me Down&quot; has a Texas swing sound that will remind you of Bob Wills. &quot;Will You Miss Me&quot; is as near to a country song as any of these tracks; the vocal is excellent and it's a nice understated arrangement. &quot;Please Baby&quot; is a soft ballad that evokes Jimmie Rodgers's &quot;Miss the Mississippi and You.&quot; My favorite cut is the last one, &quot;Feel Like Going Home&quot; (Charlie Rich compos.), which again features the guy who reminds me of Levon Helm. It's backed by simple guitar, soft strings and drums, with a nice electric guitar interlude by Knopfler. A wonderful vocal.<br />Play this one Sunday morning while the coffee is brewing and you're wondering whether you're in the mood to make an omelete or just open the cereal box. I don't have an album that I enjoy more.<br />Postscript added Aug 2001: I've since figured out that Guy Fletcher was a member of Dire Straits. Brendan Croker has a few solo albums out (I bought and enjoy very much a compilation album, &quot;not just a hillbilly&quot;). I can't find any recordings by Steve Phillips, but I'd sure like to. And, how on earth did I miss pointing out that the title, &quot;Notting Hillbillies,&quot; is a nice nod to the Kinks and their old album, &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot;? -SWstrings and drums, with a nice electric guitar interlude by Knopfler.

B00000IXL1|5.0|When OH! When will Ms Warwick and the Powers That Be release the COMPLETE discography of her Scepter recordings (63-73) and/or ALL of her Burt Bachrach?  For many of us GI's in Viet-Nam, during the era of Acid Rock, Ms Warwick's artistry (Thanks to the Columbia record Club) was the soul of Sanity. Most of her Bachrach has NEVER been equalled, much less surpassed. I believe that she is the only 60's and 70's  major artist, the great bulk of whose greatest work, is currently unavailble on CD, Any Takers?
0553213105|5.0|This book is one of my all-time favourites. It's Jane Austen's BEST literary work. This book revolves around 2 main characters- Elizabeth &amp; Darcy. Then there is Elizabeth's elder sister, &amp; her lover, Mr. Bingley. And then there are these other members of Elizabeth's family-Kitty, Lydia, Mary &amp; her mother, who are all silly &amp; superficial. Mr. Bennet (Elizabeth's father), feels Elizabeth is the only sensible one of the family. She certainly IS sensible, but not in love.  When Mrs Bennet learns that Mr. Bingley &amp; his friend, Mr.Darcy have moved in Netherfield, she is overjoyed. After all, a bachelor with a huge fortune is always a target for matchmaking mamas. She schemes different ways to make Mr. Bingley fall in love with Jane, her eldest daughter. In the mean time, Elizabeth is busy antagonising with Mr. Darcy. But while all this is going on, a military regiment comes to town, &amp; the younger Bennets are busy flirting with the officers, the most popular of all being Mr.Wickham. After a few months of staying in Netherfeild, the Bingleys &amp; Mr. Darcy depart, leaving behind a trail of broken hearts. (the most important being Jane who really is in love with Mr.Bingley, but is no match for Mr.Bingley's sister,Caroline Bingley). After their departure, Mr Wickham discloses something about Mr.Darcy which makes everybody declare that they always knew him to a proud, selfish &amp; disagreeable man. Elizabeth, of course, believes him. Darcy, meanwhile realises that he has fallen in love with Elizabeth, but his pride is revolted by the very fact of marrying beneath himself.  Whether he overcomes his pride &amp; proposes to her, what she does when he proposes, &amp; what happens after that, I'll allow to read it yourself. In the midst of all this lies the magnificent &amp; imposing figure of Lady Catherine de bourgh &amp; William Collins (also Elizabeth's cousin), who worships the very ground she walks on.  This a VERY good book, &amp; the potrayal of the characters is so true, like its taken from real life. Take my advice..READ THIS BOOK!!
0671027344|5.0|I've never read a book so real.  I am eighteen years old and in my senior year at high school. I am a popular kid and in no way do I resemble any character in this book. The amazing thing about The Perks Of Being a Wall Flower is that you don't have to relate to any the charaters to understand. Instead you can look at the people you know and maybe begin to understad them better.I would recomend this book to anyone who wants or needs to understand the confusing life of teenagers,or for teenagers who just want to understand themself.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is the best album I've ever bought. My favourite songs are Crawling, Papercut and Forgotten.<br />Buy it, it's great!
1878424319|1.0|Are we so bereft of guidance and spirituality in our contemporary culture that we think this is some kind groundbreaking revelation?  Based on most of these reviews, I'd say, unfortunately we are.  Of course the four agreements are good advise!  These are the exact same things my grandmother taught me while she peeled potatoes over the kitchen sink, or gathered eggs from the henhouse.  But then, no one ever marketed her as a Toltec mystic, so I guess that's where all the difference lies.<br />The book is very poorly written.  So, just read the cover and save yourself some time. Better yet, save your money too.  Let me summarize for you. 1. Tell the truth, to and about yourself and others.  Don't gossip.  Gossip hurts people. 2.  Don't take responsibility for other's words and actions.  They have nothing to do with you. 3.  Ask questions and be a good listener.  Don't assume you know what others want, need, or mean.  (Ever heard of 'walk a mile in my shoes'?)  And don't assume they know what you want. 4.  Always do your best.  Does this really need explanation?
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac is a companion record to KID A, recorded during the same sessions, and therefore lacks the 'freshness' that was KID. But this is all it lacks. Like Radiohead's other records, Amnesiac is an experience, a musical journey, and so flirts with greatness. The band continues to be push itself toward those uncertain musical boundries with grace and intelligence. The songs range from pure electronica, to traditional guitar and drum compositions. Amnesiac is easier for the listener to 'eneter'than KID A and yet,in the end, equally rewarding. With this record they confirm for me they are a band of forminable talent and unshakable artistic determination. They have made music interesting again. Listen closely, on some of the tracks (find them for yourself) you can hear them taunting with the sublime. Tracks 2 and 6 are gorgeous. I am 31. I haven't been this excited about music in awhile and I thank Radiohead for it.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is an excellent cd from start to finish! Highly recommended! Her voice and songs are much better than what's on the radio right now! I hope she gets the recognition she deserves! Please try the cd you won't be disappointed! Her beautiful voice is so soothing! You can pick any one of her songs and relate to it in your own life!!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|This is rap/metal/hardcore @ it's best.  This CD has helped me through some of the most difficult times of my life.  Hard-hitting, edgy without one obscenity, Linkin Park hits the proverbial nail on the head.  Generation X'ers everyhwere:  This is our Anthem CD.
B00005B4GU|5.0|1 word, brilliant. Radiohead makes listening to music interesting with songs such as &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; that has a great melody, or songs such as &quot;I might be wrong&quot; that are traditional rock songs but are different enough to get your attenion. This being my first Radiohead album, I didn't really like Kid A, this album is somewhat different. Amnesiac has excellent guitar, but also includes techno beats that get you in a great mood. This album may not be for everybody, but for those who have an open mind towards a new kind of rock will find it pleasing. A must buy. Some good tracks: <br />1. Packt Like Sardines In a Cruched Tin Box 2. Knives Out 3. Pyramid Song<br />Go buy this!
B00005BJC7|5.0|Radiohead has always been a favorite band of mine since their first album Pablo Honey. From there my love for the band has grown. I have preordered the last two albums months in advance and after hearing both I am still blown away from the differences the band accomplished with two albums recorded at the same time. Amnesiac should never ever be considered Kid B because it's not nearly as ambient driven. I can't describe how much i love the album. I plan on seeing the band when they come to the states.
B00005B4GU|4.0|A prior reviewer, Emelia from the UK whose headline is &quot;... peculiar but perfect&quot; sums up my review almost word for word.  I'm also a new Radiohead fan. I've tried listening to Kid A but found it too abstract and difficult to comprehend. Amnesiac hold up as it's own entity. Hauntingly beautiful.
B00004Z459|5.0|I thought this would be a CD filled with fillers from a little known band in the UK on their first chart entries. However, I was well impressed by the tracks. The quality just kept getting better as each track boomed out!
B00005B4GU|5.0|First I must issue a gentle warning: if you did not like Kid A, you will also not like this albumn.  This was recorded in the same session, so one shouldn't expect much of a difference between the two.  Now, while it is not their best effort, it still makes you wonder where Radiohead gets their inspiration, and want to go and get some of that. Personally, I loved Kid A, and am still hung over from that.  While Radiohead claimed there would be a difference between the music in Kid A and Amnesiac, there are only a few real differences between this and Kid A.  One is the reemergence of Thom Yorke's voice.   In addition to Thom's voice, it also has more tracks with radio playability.  Kid A was great, but there weren't really any songs that would sound good, unless in the context of the rest of the CD.  Amnesiac has track such as &quot;Pyramid Song,&quot; one of their better recorded songs ever, &quot;I Might be Wrong,&quot; &quot;You and Whose Army,&quot; and &quot;Knives Out&quot; that would all sound good coming from your local station.  While a few of the tracks here are strange, even for Radiohead, overall this albumn still lives up to the standards set by them with the addition of every new albumn they put out.  P.S.  Radiohead claims that albumn number 6 will appeal more towards those of you who were real fond of OK Computer and the Bends.
B00004T0P1|5.0|I watched Dinosaur once, the minute it ended I got online to buy the soundtrack. The music is more then just music it's one of the cast. This is one of the best movie soundtrack to come along in a long time, it is better than any Oscar winning Original Score in a long time. Don't pass this one up.
B00004TH6O|1.0|I was soooooooo disappointed by this album.  I love Josh a lot!  But this record pisses me off.  Kyuss was a king band.  QOTSA first record was phenomenal.  This, in one word, [bad].  you know how Nirvana was great and then Foo Fighters came out and you put the record on and you looked at the cover four times because you couldn't believe it was the same people?  Because they sold out to pop?  Because they started making sissy rock your mother would like?  Sissy Sissy Sissy stuff and I'm [mad]!<br />Josh, come on, cut down on the pot and sniff some cocaine, man like we did in Chicago at the Double Door!
B000001AJG|5.0|I bought this on vinyl in the 80s and practically wore it out. It is a double album and the only negative was getting up to turn or change the LP. There are some albums that have one good song, or many songs, but few that you can listen to straight through. This one is definitely one that I always would listen to straight through. It is gorgeous, uplifting, and in my opinion Stevie's best and most sophisticated work.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Personally I found this album to be easier to digest on first listen compared to Kid A.  Regardless I enjoyed Kid A, and do count it as an amazing piece of work.  Amnesiac has some great songs on it, Pyramid  Song is one of my favorites at this moment, but I have to dock the album a star simply because it seems like they could have released Kid A as a double disc set.  Many of these songs have the same feel, and go together well.  After four albums that sound progressively different from each other I expect Radiohead to take me to a new place on each of their LP's (I assume the transitional stuff will appear on singles and such) but it's not the case with Amnesiac.  Still it's one to own.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead has become one of my favorite bands in the past few years.  With the amazing &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot;, Radiohead established itself as a serious contender in the world of popular music.  Kid A pushed the envelope of acceptable norms, and in the process earned much praise.  Amnesiac continues along those lines, taking chances, and at the same time, settling into a comfortable mode for fans of pre-Kid A Radiohead.<br />Amnesiac is not as far &quot;out there&quot; as Kid-A, although I hear many of these songs were written/recorded during the Kid A studio sessions.  Highlights of the disc include the amazing opener &quot;Packt Like Sardines In A Crushed Tin Box&quot;, the sullen and beautiful &quot;You And Whose Army&quot;, and the electric groove of &quot;I Might Be Wrong.&quot;  In truth, every song on Amnesiac is a winner, though some will take longer to sink in than others.  As with any successful album, it's tough to describe the &quot;style&quot;, but if pressed, I'd say it's a combination of The Bends and Kid-A.<br />I take music very seriously, and I am totally comfortable recommending Amnesiac to people who have never heard of Radiohead.  To those of you that love the other RH albums, you will be very satisfied with Amnesiac.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This album is definitely not a return to old school school Radiohead, but I do thinik it's more accessible than Kid A.  If you like the band's style of trippy instrumental mixed with whiney vocals, then you'll probably like Amnesiac.  I found most of the songs to be really engaging, too -- this is not a collection of &quot;Treefingers&quot; remixes, thank god.<br />If you're a Radohead fan, definitely pick this one up.
0792151712|5.0|Titanic.  The name itself means disastor, romance, heroism and tragety all in one.  But it also applies to the biggest, most succesful film of all time.  Describing the story is pointless seince almost everybody alive has herd of it.  The special effects for this film are breathtaking.  To call them phenominal is obviously an understatement.  Every rivit, every piece of wood, every piece of furniture is remade in increddible detail.  James Cameron obviously did his homework when he was making this film.  Almost everything about it is historically accurate, with 3 minor exceptions(Mr. Andrews did not notice the shaking in his cabin, there was no suction when the ship went down, and Mr Ismay was crushed by a funnel) Everything else is perfect in every way.  The sinking sequences are the best part and are worth watching, in fact, in my opinion, the final 10 minutes of the sinking sequence are the best shots ever to be made in a movie.  Ever.  When Jack and Rose are running around inside the ship, outrunning water your heart will jump.  Although you know they will make it it is still terrifying, the dim lights,green water and ever submerging corridors will make your heart jump.  The acting is superb and is well done.  The soundtrack is outstanding and perfectly captures the mood of the story and feeling.  I think it is the second best soundtrack ever made (Next to Independence Day)  Overall this is a fantastic movie that should not be missed.  Highly reccomended.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|First of all this movie is one of the most original, extrordinary, and brilliant movies I've ever seen.  I loved Romeo+Juliet by director Baz Luhrmann who directed this movie.  They had the same feel somewhat with the camera angles and how he viewed Moulin Rouge.  I'm not much on musical movies, but Moulin Rouge blew me away.  First of all having music from the last couple of decades gave the movie a feel of depth and not just drag you into a deep pit of despair.  The movie had a dark feel to it, but I loved it.  Bottom line:See the movie if you like off beat movies.
B00005JH7D|3.0|You know I bought this CD on reviews claiming it to be new jazz grooves for the new millenium.  I liked his Tales CD and thought there would be some great new stuff on this one.  I was disappointing however as it includes the same old funk type grooves.  Yes there are cool tunes and Marcus Miller's playing is awesome...but I was hoping for something....well new.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Upon first listen it may appear that, with Amnesiac, Radiohead is stepping back from the fringe of electronic obsession and offering up more computerless guitar/piano/keyboard/trumpet-driven music, foregoing the sampler.  While this is true (with the exception of a few tracks, especially Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors), this works to let the listener heed more readily the visceral lyrics, the shiver-inducing voice of Yorke, and the spirit-crushing mood of the various instruments they use to convey their particularly lugubrious treatise on the cold, pale modern individual.  <BR>  \\"Pyramid Song\\" is an example, relying primarily on Yorke and a mournful piano to tell the tale of a passage to heaven, possibly a sequel to \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\"(?).  It's too early to tell yet, but subjectively speaking \\"Pyramid\\" is the most moving song, cathardic on the level with \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\"--utterly hopeless and infinitely hopeful at the same time (ie--\\"there was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt (PS)\\", \\"I will see you in the next life(MPS)\\").  ...  This is a phenomenal CD.  \\"Pyramid Song\\" and \\"Dollars and Cents\\" have haunted me in unspeakable ways for the last several days I have owned this astounding piece of music history.  <BR> Keep grinding, men.  Just, please, dont make it another three years before the next offering!
B00003CXDZ|2.0|This picture will not revive the musical genre. On a par with the inventive musicals of the past, &quot;Show Boat&quot;, &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot;, it was nauseating. Just when I expected some interesting dialogue the star crossed lovers sing the soft rock oldies that just hold no interest when heard on screen. Yeah, I got the part where we're led to believe that the modern day rock and roll stars are the modern day Bohemians. Oh, brother! Who hasn't heard those pretensious declarations before,  made ad naseaum by many hollywood movie stars, rock and roll personalities every day on television, radio, movies and countless magazines. It sort of pokes fun at itself but not to the extent that &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; enjoyed and certainly isn't as engaging. I hope the people who buy the soundtrack understand that they may as well have just turned on the local 70's and 80's station to hear the same songs. Too bad the producers couldn't fork over the money to create some new love songs for the show.  It sort of reminded me of a teenagers view of truth, beauty and love , along with all the antics with which teenagers involve themselves - if that was the intended audience - score.
