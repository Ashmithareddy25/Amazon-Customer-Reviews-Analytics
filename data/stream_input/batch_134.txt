B00029JQ3G|3|this is relatively cheaply made, arrived scratched and the cup holder size adjustment is quite flimsy. it is priced about right for what it is. i do not feel ripped off, but i beither am i warm and fuzzy over a new gizmo for the truck.
B00029XHZ4|1|If you want a wolo 430 horn DO NOT buy from horm balsters. it say you are buying a wolo horn  until in the mail you get their brand. if I wanted the off brand there were plenty for much cheaper.
B00B7GC518|2|Didn't really help with charging, even after in direct sunlight for days.
B007CVSBL0|5|These hold firm in my truck bed rails.  They are flush mount and look great.  When you pull up hard they will lock in place for attaching hooks, straps etc..
B001PNG7GC|5|I had to change my old O2 sensors just before I hit 200k miles. These are super easy to install. I changed both mine for ~$100 and an hour of my time. Before I changed them myself, I got a quote from a local mechanic and he was going to charge me $450 to do it (!!!!!).
B000FPYW4K|5|Works as mentioned.  Great tool to have in your tool box for pulling seals on Automotive or small engines with ease.
B000BZXSRQ|5|I recently bought these rotors along with new pads (wagner thermoquiet pads, highly recommended, read my review on them if contemplating which pads to get...) to replace the front brakes on my girlfriends car.<br /><br />These are very basic rotors, not drilled, slotted, zinc covered, etc. Don't let that fool you. These rotors are all that is needed for the average car today. You can spend a bunch more money and get fancier pieces, but odds are unless you have a high powered, extremely heavy, or track-use vehicle these rotors will do the job just as well.<br /><br />Well machined, no structural damages, scratches, imperfections.<br /><br />Can't beat the price.
B006JHM4TS|1|We bought this bec my son, who had just graduated to a booster seat, was getting raw spot on his shoulder where the seat belt rubbed against him.  Bought these bec they looked cute.  Used on his seat belt and the other for one of the straps on his younger brother's seat.  The head came off of it within a week.  It's just flued on, glueing felt never works well.  It's not sewn on at all.
B001DCH3T0|5|Work great! The back glass doesn't hit me in the head anymore when I try to place small things in the back of my Ford Escape. I should have bought these years ago.
B004O6PX1M|1|Do they fit in a 2000 Maxica
B000CGTLV6|3|The online fitment guide that Amazon offers stated that these would work on the wifes 2009 BMW X5. They DO NOT, they are the wrong type (single disk non-vented), and the wrong size(12.5&#34; as opposed to orig. 13.6&#34;). The picture shown is not representative of the actual product.
B0041TR892|2|I have hit the construction cone in 40mph. The mirror and bottom plastic were poped out.<br />I had the same hit with the original mirror couple of time before it's broke, and there was no any such issue at all.
B00E6ACRO2|5|Nice
B007Q18DHS|5|great
B00317FQ4O|5|Great system if you want some thunder added to the Yamaha FZ6!! Installation was a snap if your somewhat mechanically inclined!! Man what a difference this system makes compared to the stock system that comes with it!!! LOVE IT!!! SOMETIMES I JUST START IT UP JUST TO HEAR THE SYSTEM GROWL!!!
B0072P8T9U|5|You definitely need this.  In my RV, there is often more than 10°C difference between the solar controller and the batteries.
B005NFNGEE|1|We bought the same brand cover 2 years ago, for a smaller camper. That one fits very well, and has worked great through 2 Maine winters.  So we bought the same brand for our new, larger toy hauler.  This cover is extremely cheap.  The 2 campers are covered and sitting side by side.  You can look at both of them and see right through the new cover.  It is very thin and doesn't fit well.  We put it on yesterday and it has 2 holes in it already because it is so thin. The length on the package and description says we ordered the correct one, but it is much too big.  If not for the fact that we waited too long to get this, and have no time to return it, it would definitely be going back.  Not to mention we could never package it back up. Not the quality we expect for that much money.  Don't buy this.....go to an RV store, and get a good quality cover that will fit!
B001LXMHL0|2|This compass did not point to true north.  Bought this as a gift but could not give it due to the lack of function.
B007Z1U1V0|5|After frying the second rebuilt starter in my 1973 Ford truck, I was looking for a better choice. The last time I looked the only real option was a high-performance/racing starter - this new build starter from DB Electrical is quieter and works better than any rebuilt I've ever installed, for a price just a little higher. Very pleased and will look for a DB Electrical starter for any of my other vehicles when it's time for a replacement.
B00J4WZPCS|3|This looks like someone printed off of their PC, and did a crappy job cutting it. Once the blue M logo was stuck onto the glass, it revealed that there are uneven white edges around the blue logo. It is already stuck on, so trimming it would be difficult at best.<br /><br />3 stars, just because it is what the ad says it is, and it sticks to glass.
B000M5YZBI|5|You can hit things realy well with these
B0019A11PS|5|This is a nice sized construction vac. It has handled both water and dust easily. Forgot to put the filter back in though and the dust blew all over the space. Duh. With the filter, which can be rinsed out with a hose, the dust stayed put in the vac. I did get confused by the cover. It fits backwards, but then the hose does not attach. I called the company and studied the manual and because there was no photo of the full vac in the manual, I didn't realize I had the cover on backwards at first. The help line didn't think anyone would be so misguided to advise looking at if it was on backwards. But hey, I finally did figure it out.
B004KL0I9I|5|good thing for home garage, i'm using it for my cars ford explorer 2002 limited reading engine, and for my audi a4 2000<br /><br />time of purchase, I have the wrong address,<br /><br />Thanks to the seller for their attention and assistance, they did everything possible that I received my order.
B006J7ECP2|1|I was really disappointed that I received the wrong product.the product almost set my car on fire after I installed it. however I am satisfied that I received a refund after returning the product.

B008ZFE0NA|5|Great fit and sharp. Comes with hardware
B00OL4QK4Q|3|Very good price, quality not the best
B003Z49L2G|3|Berry good But the soft gone   don't last long time.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Accurate description and fast shipment.
B00JMQDIUC|5|Work. Fine
B00D8BFJP4|5|Awesome sticker, and fast delivery
B003EOZMKM|2|Save your money and buy some Genrights or Poison Spyders.  I'm not sure if it was due to shipping, but the holes did not line up, the instructions are crap, and the front of the fenders were bent.  I would have sent them back but I had already cut my fenders so there was no going back after that.
B000GVRGTG|5|It won't really transform your cargo van into a convertible, but it lets so much light into the van that I had to make a shade for it.<br />Pros:<br />-Huge<br />-Opens<br />-Comes out completely so you can pretend you are on Safari<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Template could be better, you have to cut it out of a huge sheet of paper that has been folded a bunch of times.<br />- Instructions are not completely idiot proof.<br /><br />I installed this on a 2012 Nissan NV, and it is fantastic for letting heat out in the summer, and light in the whole year. I did have to use a fair bit of caulk to seal it up, since the area I installed it in had roof ribs, but it doesn't leak.<br />Measure four times, cut once. Use a sawzall if your roof supports are thick, like those in the NV. Jigsaw is fine for corners, but I managed to go around the gentle bends using the sawzall, no problem.
B002MQAWOY|5|Nice
B000BUQOAE|2|The opening is so small it would take you forever to get water through it.
B004WPQZTE|5|Got these for my 2010 Triumph Bonnie about 9 months ago and really happy with the purchase. Mounted them on the stock handle bars which are threaded so I had to get some new hardware to bolt them on.
B006RXPV4Y|5|Good
B000IXTGHW|1|We bought this unit in December 2014, first arrival product would not heat???  Warrantied the unit and was sent a replacement...  Second unit heats but fan barely functions...  Now its March and the cord caught fire in the car, and yes the kids were with us...  DO NOT PURCHASE
B00EW3DCY2|5|Works like a charm, if only my hoses weren't broken.<br /><br />If only it made my car faster... look into that, Saab.
B000GBD2VM|5|bolted right in, great fit, noticeably stronger than the 20+ old lifts that were siting on the car, very happy
B00L8G8IKE|1|Will they fit on a 2013 stock headlight 4 cylinder access cab Toyota and any ideas of its brighter than stock bulbs
B001BNHY1S|5|great thank you
B00B7GC50Y|5|woked great on electric fencer to maintain a car battery running mid sized the fencer.
B004SCKZZQ|5|They are pretty soft, and comfortable. decent size. I use it to dry my car. Not too thick but not too thin.
B003I3PIQC|5|This helped me out a lot and for a great price.  Fit perfectly in a 1998 Corolla and arrived quickly.
B001LHVQIQ|3|The MaxiTrip works well in my opinion, with only one exception.  That is the Black Box function.  The battery back up that maintains the real-time clock is too small and even with a full charge will only maintain the time for about 8 hours.  This results in the time freezing until your next trip.  I've found I can keep the battery charged by making a homemade LAN power connector from an old adapter.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, there is no Tech Support or warrany of any kind if the unit should break.  A one year warranty isn't worth anything if you can't replace a broken unit.  It's a good thing Harbor Frieght administers the extended warranties on the Autel scan tools, because I also had one of them break on me.<br /><br />There is one thing that needs getting used to when driving at night.  The display is very bright, actually it's too bright to have the gauge mounted on top of the dash, like a GPS.  There is no way to lower the brightness of the high intensity LEDs that backlight the display.  I've thought about trying window tinting over the display to block some of the light, but I am getting used to it now.<br /><br />Otherwise, the unit works very well.  I had no problem adjusting the speed using my GPS.  I used km/h for a finer resolution to dial it in with GPS, but when you switch the MaxiTrip back to English units, you'll have to reset the tank capacity.  This is because the MaxiTrip deducts one gallon each time you switch from English to Metric and back to English units.  It must be some kind of rounding error, but I never was able to get in touch with Tech Support to see if it could be fixed.<br /><br />Once the fuel usage percentage is adjusted properly, it seems to be fairly accurate, but is consistently a half gallon higher than manually taking the mileage and dividing it by the gallons.  Even if it isn't exact, the best part of the MPG function is being to see how adjusting your driving has an effect in real-time.  Instead of numbers, it would have been nice to see a graphic representation of how efficient you are driving, like the leaves growing in a hybrid.<br /><br />The scan part of the MaxiTrip works well, but there is no documentation on what some of the cryptic abbreviations mean.  Since I only have idiot lights for most gauges, it's nice being able to see what the voltage or temp is without having to open the hood or get out other test equipment.  It even tells you instantly if your car will pass a computer emissions inspection test.  You may still fail if you have a tailpipe test, but you can be sure the electronics are working.<br /><br />All in all, for the price, it's is the most informative trip computer available.  If you only want to see fuel economy, there are better alternatives, some of which include graphics.  However, considering price, preformance and features together, I don't think there is a better trip computer.would have been nice to see a graphic representation of how efficient you are driving, like the leaves growing in a hybrid.<br /><br />The scan part of the MaxiTrip works well, but there is no documentation on what some of the cryptic abbreviations mean.

B000CITK8S|4|I especially like this battery tender because it has a long enough DC cord to allow the unit to be plugged in to the wall and I can run the car up and down on the lift while it is charging.
B007HRKBNK|5|Very heavy and well made. If you order the equalizer hitch order the ball also.
B002XM5G70|5|I live in Trailer  24/7 . After 5 years using this pump every day my old pump start get very noisy and one day quit on me. I search Ebay and Amazon and I cross with new Shurflo  Revolution pumps. I must say I am very pleased with the product. It has very good water pressure  and it is very quiet. Time will tell how durable it is. So far so good.  Tadgyro
B00B13UGWM|2|Fell off my motorcycle (due to poor welding on the piece) shortly after I installed it.
B001Z298FK|4|purchased a few as gag gifts and the folks really like them
B005BN46TM|4|nice accy for the car, colors stand out and it fastens by velcro which is nice and easy to use.
B00E9FSM6G|5|The sticker worked great.  I used it to make a flag on my son's dresser.  I would also recommend the company (Stickers and Tees).  There was an error in the first shipment, but they corrected it right away with no issues.
B000CNJNWG|5|I put them on Saturday and they fit and look good. Thank you
B000GZPH2U|5|Works great
B000DINKPQ|3|It sounds like a formula air horn more than a car horn, not that loud, nice replacement speaker though. Still very high pitched. Would not recommend if you are wanting a lower pitched horn.
B00H1TSOO2|5|Can see at night now! Thank you
B00DQJ8G6C|5|Great product, put on my 2010 F150 in about two minutes, it looks great like is saw made for the truck specifically and functions well for being so short.
B009TBCAQ8|4|It's been a tough winter with a lot of snow and slush.  Some has managed to get around the edges of the liner.  For the most part it has protected the floor of the car.  In my estimation, the material could be a bit more heavy-duty and flexible.
B009HCMFMI|5|The  battery met all of my expectations just as it was advertised.  The battery was delivered as stated at the point of sale.
B000IYLZDO|5|This Motorcraft SW-6350 kit is the replacement for the recalled cruise control. It's a 5 minute job to replace the screw-in fitting, and the mini-harness plugs right in. Good price. ('95 Ford F-350)
B00KSD47IU|5|Works great, buttons sit a little high, but will get used to that, installed easy
B00C6MU1XG|5|These two parts worked well in helping me to improve the suspension of my 1999 Lexus SUV.<br />I am pleased to have purchased them.
B00EAOIRI4|5|Easy to install and the cabin filter fit perfectly into my 2009 Honda Fit Sport. This has 25 corrugated folds compared to the 40 in the original cabin filter that I replaced. But this doesn't impact the functionality so far.
B00BB0W5FG|1|DOA
B0019COQ6C|5|Wow, not sure why I had not bought this before, but after having it I would not go back to a manual gun. It is delivers and has a high degree of quality/workmanship built in.
B00C0CN7HY|5|I bought a generic XL helmet from Walmart and it barely fit my head.  This 2XL helmet fits great and it's very comfortable.
B000EDOSNI|5|Excellent!!! can't beat this price
B0066OS0TC|4|You need a little room for this ballast, this is my second kit from Zenex,the first kit I bought was the compact, very good, thin and works fine on my other car, in this first probe car with this compact but causes me every time I turn on the lights the radio was interfere, media player to radio sets ... probe with these thinking they were not going to interfere. I'm still looking for what else I can do ... to that switching on the HID does not interfere ... very good product.
B000M5X0MS|4|Works the way it's supposed to. Good quality.
B0020CD8WS|5|What can you say- it's beautiful!!
B000CMDCKQ|5|Works well for my purpose. Item looks great.
B0012FD5J0|5|Works like a charm, and much less expensive than the Chinese made metal ones.
B003NICPWC|5|excellent
B00062Z3ZE|5|These spark plug boots were excellent, worked just like they were suppose to and looked good as well, very happy
B0002SRH7Y|5|Nice tool to have around. Why spend 300 on a tool that you need once in a while when at at half the price this will get the job done.
B0052YZZAY|1|Brought this for my sons new car and they ripped the first time he put them on! They are not good quality at all!
B000H961YI|5|Since we fish just about every day bought this charger to keep the deep cell batteries on our bass boat charged without having to wait all day to reach a full charge. When I first got it thought I may have made a mistake because it was so small and light in weight and to my surprise it more than did the job of charging the battery in the time they say it will. Can say the size and weight of this charger is a real plus. Just set it to the charge rate and forget it. It will charge your battery and shut down when fully charged. Unplug it and you are ready to go. If you charge a battery like I do almost every day this is the charger for you. Speed and quality at a great price.
B004W5O1W2|5|Good
B001AY2WLU|5|I love these, and I've bought some for family and friends. They're small enough to keep on your keychain if that's your thing. I keep one in my car jockey-box, plus one in my purse, and one in my tool drawer at home.
B002C7DSIK|1|junk
B000BZEHZ8|5|worked, did the job...thanks
B004M99MF4|5|I took this kit out into the Black Rock Desert in Nevada, to keep my phone and nook charged during the Burning Man festival.  For those who don't know, that place is like the surface of Mars- constant dust storms and extreme heat are the norm there.  Plenty of sunlight though!  In the morning I would toss this panel onto the roof of my tent, where it would bake in 110 degree heat while charging.  By the evening, the battery pack was ready to go and the panel was buried in playa dust- which cleaned off decently with a baby wipe.  There weren't any rainclouds in sight so I did not have to worry about exposing it to the elements.  The panel also has lots of loops sewn into it that let you tether it wherever you need to.      I would recommend getting the combined battery + panel kit instead of just charging from the solar panel.  As a general rule, use the solar panel to charge the battery pack, and use the battery pack to charge your gear.  The panel's output depends heavily on how much sun is hitting it- if anything gets between direct line of sight between the sun and your panels (a cloud, a person, etc) that output will drop dramatically.  The battery pack will take any juice it can get from the panel, but modern cell phones and devices are picky and want a constant output to charge with.  If you charge them directly from the panel, you will find that they will bounce from charging to discharging, or throw errors and refuse to charge.    If you are an outdoorsy person and you have a USB-charging cellphone, or you have a lot of AA-powered devices, this kit is for you.
B00K72A29K|2|Great looking running boards, but very difficult to put on. WOW what a headache! Huge bag full of nuts, bolts, washers and pieces of metal. With 1 sheet of paper with 3 pictures on it for directions!! Probably the worst directions I've ever come across. After a half day of trying to install i managed to get it on somewhat secured with have a bag of hardware left. I can't understand the extensive amount of hardware.
B00239X8VY|5|Comfortable
B00NEX78IM|4|I love it except it is so much smaller than I was thinking it was.
B00230ECOK|5|work like a charm.
B009IF1NF4|5|I used this motor for the driver-side door of a 2000 Honda CR-V.  There are several Youtube videos that teach you how to replace the motor.  Watch them and you should have very few problems.
B005VKP08Q|5|Fast shipping. Happy with it!
B002VE3VHW|5|excellent quality, waterproof and fits my rider perfectly.
B000FGECW6|4|I purchased this model because it is the same model as my previous RV detector, and my husband didn't want to drill new holes for the mounting bracket.  That said, the old one died about a year before its expiration date.
B002SSBPQK|5|This item was very good at doing the job I needed to completely clean my car's leather interior. This is a excellent product.
B001KOBDGU|4|Nice mufflers, gave my 1200 Sporty a good sound. Not overly loud, but even Harley guys turn their heads when I fire it up now. Some backfiring in the pipe occasionally after rolling off throttle probably from the lack of restriction/backpressure, but not excessive. Somewhat overpriced, but isn't nearly everything nowadays. Hey Rush, for this kind of money, how about throwing in new crossover pipe gaskets in with these mufflers? (You will need to replace them)
B00DBEM6U4|1|They were supposed to match with my chevy 2009 and they don't! Bad ad.
B003NI1H5I|5|I used these to replace the old ones on both the hood and the rear hatch. Works perfect, much cheaper than the dealer, easy to install
B000WJ781S|5|Great quality housing, heavy strong, perfect coat of gloss black. 3 wire system, works great in my  2 wire setup with the run/turn/brake controller.<br />Lights are super bright!! Way brighter than my previous LED lights.
B000F5JM0O|5|Not sure how anyone could live without one of these!
B008N0VUK8|5|Perfect. I want more of varying sizes.
B0039YI894|5|top quality loom, the thick kind that wont kink or bend
B00080QHMM|2|Worked fine for 3 weeks now it allways reeds -00-.<br /><br />Maybe its just mine but i am disappointed in this product.
B002P33KVQ|5|Works great!
B001AWU6KQ|5|A quality product.  Put together well and works great.
B00F8TWN6W|5|Would have came on time if it wasn't for the holidays but anyways my aunt love her gift so 5 stars it is
B002OUMVWY|5|This is a great hose and can be cut to a shorter length if you had a need.  There are several other posts that say the end fell off and that there is no glue.  While the directions are poor it is important to know that the end is two piece and one of them is left hand thread.  Just check to be sure the end is tight and go.  I really like that with the way this is built I can cut it and reattach the ends if I were to ever have a hole, crush, or other problem.
B0007IFX7A|4|Similar to a previous reviewer, I installed this on my 01 Subaru Outback.  Amazon/Curt shipped the product quickly and it arrived via UPS as scheduled.  The hitch is very sturdy (heavier than I thought), with a nice black finish.  All parts were in the shipping box.      The fit-up was \\"acceptable\\" but certainly not perfect.  The driver side did not line up real well with the hole in the chassis (tie-down hole), but I was able to pull it into place by using a large wrench on the bolt.  This left about a 3/4 inch gap on the same location on the passenger side.  I bought several washers from Ace and used them to fill the gap.  It now fits pretty well, maybe just a little bit lower on the driver side.  I have not tried to hock up the trailer yet, but have not doubt that it will do the job.
B00B9EZOV6|1|Bought this grill for my 2005 expedition measurements were off just by a bit the grill was a little small and was useless.. Bought for $98 decided to return it and get my money back YET I had to pay $71 to ship it back almost what It cost me:/SUCKS!!!!!  So disappointed like if it was my fault I made it the wrong f*@ken size ugh !!! Not a happy customer I lost money
B00EZ21PRQ|5|Love my tag!  Looks fantastic and arrived very quickly and well packaged.  Thank you
B0043063JU|5|The colors are as expected, and the quality is great for the price.  I needed something to cover the rough surface of my deck in Seattle, and this rug is exactly what I wanted.
B003V3RVWI|4|Since I complained about his wheel cleaner, got to give Griot his props for this car wash kit.  Like most of you I was reluctant to be rubbing anything on a dry car, but the lubricity (huh?) of this product seems to be enough to prevent scratching.  I had a  very unwell bird attack my hood the other day, after rinsing off what I could with seltzer water I did the whole hood with this car wash and these MF towels.  Got rid of all signs of illness.  This product seems to do the job, and with a drought looming in LA this summer I suppose I'll be using it a lot more.  I think if you're going to use it you should use his towels as well.
B005345DOQ|5|Product came in.  This is great.  When you're riding you get a lot of head turns and a LOT of thumbs ups!<br /><br />Practically, this will protect your face from stray pebbles, leaves and other crap that you run in to.  The only thing is if its raining, you may feel like you're sufforcating.  The material is breathable so when you're riding, the wind will help keep you cool.  But if you're in traffic, you're gonna suffer.
B00C2Y4P7G|5|This is pretty sweet! Especially if you have issues with speed cameras like I do :) But the instruction booklet leaves something to be desired
B009RC2HVC|5|I ordered on Sunday and it arrived on Thursday. Removal procedure:<br />Use some king of rust breaker liquid on the old bolts if they are tight.<br />Pull off the old bezel (mine was already broken off)<br />Rotate the plastic rod clips down.<br />Pull the rods out of the latch. They are long enough that you don't have to worry about them falling into the tailgate.<br />Use a 13mm socket to remove the three bolts that hold the latch on.<br /><br />Installation:<br />Bolt the latch on.<br />Push the rods into the latch and rotate the new clips (supplied) upward. I used a long-nosed pliers to get the clip to snap on.<br />Use alcohol to remove any remnants of the old two-sided foam. Remove the paper from one side of the foam on the new latch.<br />Position the bezel over the latch. Set the bottom tabs of the bezel into the holes in the tailgate and snap the bezel in.<br /><br />It looks and works fine.
B001CI5A72|2|Bought this in April 2015 by mid July 2015 it shredded.  Should have went with the belt I used before, at least it lasted almost 2 years.
B00BQE5IKG|5|i bought 6 packs of 4. of that, only 2 stands failed to work at all. they light my bike up very well!
B00IGU9S8Q|4|Pump up both of my flat tires on my hand truck in less than a minute.
B00651CLCS|1|Awesome if you don't want to listen to AM/FM radio. Reception is horrible.
B009AQX1YW|5|Excellent product.  Easy installation  and the fastest shipping that I have experienced. I am all about convenience when it comes to towing, and this product makes hook up and storage a breeze.
B001G45YGO|5|I was introduced to Ultra luster by a friend of mine.  I ordered my first bottle two weeks ago, it arrived with in 3 days.  My car is pearl red and new 2014, After putting this on my car looks like a diamond, and the surface is so slick it is unbelievable.  I will be buying this product from now on, and will be telling all my friends about this.
B00433SIQI|3|This review is based solely on opinion after using it to tint my window. My opinion and experience with this product may vary from the opinion of other reviewers. I have not been endorsed in any way by the manufacturer of the product to write this review.<br />The kit is pretty good if you do not have the materials that come in the kit. Honestly, I did not really like the squeegee tool that was provided in the kit. The solution worked well for the type of tint film that I used and the little knife also came in handy on a couple of occasions. I had pre-cut film that I used, so I really did not use the knife tool much. However, if you are doing the lining of your windows yourself you will probably need that particular tool.<br />If I had to do it over again, I would probably not have bought this product and would have probably just used soap and water for solution and bought a squeegee tool from a local home improvement store like Home Depot, simply because of the tool that was provided. I felt like it was very cheaply made and was extremely uncomfortable to use on my car. I think a credit card size squeegee tool would have been a lot better because it is smaller, easier to handle and can squeegee bubbles a lot easier.<br />Lastly, the low lint cloth was not really what I expected either, I used it because it was pretty thin and easy to reach the edges whenever I cleaned the windows before I installed the tint. However, for the most part I used a micro fiber towel that I bought in the past to use when I wax my car and that in my opinion worked a lot better to dry and clean the film after it was installed. In my opinion the lint cloth came in useful, but could have definitely used the microfiber cloth for the entire process.
B000BP7M8W|5|Excellent product. This is the second one we have purchased. The first one went with our RV when we recently sold it. We purchased another RV and ordered the hose for it.
B00GT37B0Y|2|This is really really small.  This is a wind visor only for your eyes and will do little regarding the rain.  To be honest, it might be Biltwell has a small helmet, I do not know buy it is too small to have any real use.  I am still looking for a larger one. Make sure this small visor will really accomplish the reason you are buying it.
B000YBON4E|5|I'm a photografer  and use for many reasons.  the belt holds the lens case, gps and more. I'm use daily for 4 years.  only now show signs of wear. I bought 2 more  I recommend
B000630696|3|Well,  my opinion is that his gauge is not accurate.  In a controlled environment,  in an oven with a clean power supply it tests fine-  but in a vehicle,  I am getting readings about 30 degree's hotter than reality (as measured by other instrumentation)…  so my opinion is that if you buy it,  try it soon so you can send it back if necessary.
B00KTHY2DA|5|i have a 2006 Toyota Highlander and the Replacenent Keyless Entry works GREAT took the inside out of the old one and put it in the new one works great.
B002XYT2HI|4|Only reason for giving 4 stars, is they were &#34;lost in shipping&#34;. but amazon sent out 2 more free of charge and got it the next day. Fixed my 2002 impala ls traction/abs light. easy install, but didn't go all the way to where it meets the other wire loom. Great product. will update as time goes by.
B009KM1HOM|5|I LOVE it!!!! Everyone tell me that is so nice I want one. It's really nice. I'm going to get me another one for my laptop.
B0012TUJDQ|1|Followed the instructions verbatim and upon install in a 1980 CT70 it quickly blew the fuse and wasted every single bulb on the bike including the sealed beam headlight which is $40 alone. It turns out the pin connector on the battery is wired backwards from the factory. I bought the exact same model of Bikemaster battery several years ago and it did not have this issue, it was made better, the insulation on the wiring was thicker, the wiring itself was longer and low and behold it was made in Taiwan. They are now made in China. Go figure.
B00141DAJ2|2|It said they fit either style seat, I have a Liberty without headrests. Not happy with the fit. I like them but wish they fit more snug
B003K2ETO8|5|good pads, some dust but that is to be expected. I should have done the front's too, but I only did the back on a 2008 GTI
B0047RV8WG|5|exacto
B0040CYTFQ|4|the clips work good, as intended.<br />I have 2 complaints - these items should not be sold separately.  They should come with the mudflaps.  And the quantity should be 4 per mudflap -- why should I pay for 7 extras that probably will never be used?
B00CSUUWEO|5|This ANLI trunk mount is constructed very well and is easy to install. The variable adjustments are more flexible than was advertised which allows for more  installation options.
B00310WNEW|5|excelente
B0025272PW|5|These filters work great on my 2009 Jetta TDI.  I've done several oil changes so far, and so far no complaints about Mann products.
B0049DYVVS|5|Replaced a broken factory part perfectly
B004P20FGI|5|I was a bit hesitant when I ordered this.  I have used Best Top products for my Jeep and have always been happy with them but I was not sure what to expect when I ordered this.  I got it in and it was ready to go right out of the box.  Take it out, set it on the bed railings, position it where you want it to be and fasten it with easy to use clamps that are attached to the tonneau cover.  Easy and secure and would definitely recommend to another.
B000CPZYC2|5|this is very good grit sandpaper I recommend it to anyone who needs to sand anything. The shipping was extremely fast as well. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs sandpaper.
B00028A95G|4|CruzTOOLS did the job.  It fits the torx screws on the 2014 Road King handle bar controls.
B000FGICHW|5|Bought to replace Brasso since reformulated version is less effective than old version.  Works well.
B00C5SWAIU|4|This product is great if your husband has patience to install.  It will take you more then 5 minutes.  Otherwise a great product
B008XNBMPS|5|Very easy to install. Precisely what was expected. Excellent value. Perfect defense against people who are not considerate when parking.
B000XBCURW|5|Aero 303 is the best stuff around.  We use it on our cars and boat in lieu of Armor All.  It lasts longer and has more preservative properties.  We recently trusted it with our high-end cast metal patio furniture. We live in Southern California and this furniture gets a lot of sun.  Aero 303 has not disappointed us yet!
B003FBV8ZW|5|all good glasses  the fit was a little tight on the bridge of my nose (bit wide  my nose) lol but good quality
B003VLBPJA|5|I love the net, the cheap plastic hooks could be better, makes me think they're going to break. I would just replace them with some climbing hooks with the springs and this is perfect!
B004LDC5DM|5|Great savings and my boyfriend put it in!
B001DRP9KK|3|This filter doesn't fit my car Lexus RX 350 2007 year. My filter filter itself hasn't  arrows showing &#34;front&#34; and &#34;up&#34; direction so it's not easy to install. You may be confused.
B00CMU9GOC|5|Ummm wow the install is pretty simple and it works the kill switch really doesn't work anymore but acts like a tuner switch now lol. I have now gone past the 40 mph limiter. No rejetting yet only mods are exhaust and air filters and a weight plan. Top speed so far 53 and I'm 165 hoping for a bit more with a few more tricks. It does help going up hills too my ruckus was doing 20 up pretty steep hill now I can hold 30 if doing 30. Well worth the money no doubt.
B001EOWPQI|5|I didn't have time to install this myself but it looks sturdy enough and did a great job of pulling a 5X8 Uhaul trailer behind our 2008 Subaru Legacy. I've purchased other Curt hithces and they have all done what I've asked of them and quality very good.
B00JLVHY4Y|4|Order was satisfactory.
B00ANZMKK0|4|I had about 120,000 on the stock sport shocks when I replaced with these on my 2003 330i sport. The ride was MUCH better afterward. I also like how the yellow shocks look in the wheel wells. Sport ride height was maintained. One thing to note though, there are locator tabs on the front struts that had thick weld beads that prevented the strut from sliding into the control arm properly. I used a hacksaw and file to remove this, then everything installed just fine. I reached out to Precision European Motorwerks for advice before doing this and they were very helpful and responsive. They appear to be a solid product at a great price. I just recommend that they modify how they weld this locating tab in the future (stock had two small round &#34;buttons&#34; to locate the strut).
B000CN72ME|5|I Purchased this bushings for a 93 Civic LSI Hatchback, Euro model, in my country, Cape Verde, most of the roads are cobbles, with lots of holes, so i installed with my friend help, they look nice, without tools, only using hammers and a soft wood and paper fire, we spend 2 days changing the whole car bushings including trailing arm, the ride is smooth now, the difference with the rubber is huge, no more squeeze noise inside the car, i will not have problems in years. Great buy. Oh remember to check all the arms when you finish, you dont want something loose there.
B002YRHQBI|2|While understanding this is not an original manufactured product, was not expecting it to be so cheap. The screw hole to adjust the height was not even functional and one of the actual headlights burned out within a couple days causing me to have to purchase new bulbs. Hope this isn't reoccuring cause having to replace bulbs every week is not good!<br /><br />Do not buy from this supplier.
B000CBTMHO|5|i chose this rating because this product i have seen before and used a similar product and it protects the car hood great
B00940ZNH2|4|Exact fit. Was able to use my bike stand. The quality is as described.  Some people were reporting about the bolt not being an
B00EMKBRMO|3|Love the jeep decal but I wish it was bigger :)
B00GQ2TC14|3|The wiring is paper shielded?  weird.
B001QJD45C|5|OK!
B000CB3ZDG|5|I love Mann Filters, always excellent fit and mayor filtering than others. The best in the market in my opinion
B00230L658|5|Works great.  Installed quickly without any problems.  This is a lot easier than using a shovel.
B004XONW54|4|Picked this up for my 67 GTO to turn on my additional electrical fan.  It seems to kick on about 10 degree's later than advertised but it does work.<br />It's looks a little out of place on the front manifold but not much I can do about that other than find a manifold with a plug in the rear (which mine didn't have).<br />Install was easy and it doesn't leak.<br />Would buy again<br />- 1 star because it turns on a tad late
B003OXUPOQ|5|Great quality valve!  It is a pleasure to change oil and it is super fast when hot and you remove the fill cap.  Only sad thing is I sold a car that had this same valve on for 8 years and I forgot to take it off so I'm buying a 4th valve for my new car.  You can adjust washer thickness so the valve lever is in the best direction (ussually up).  I've tested two vehicles by pulling this valve out to see if the valve restricted any oil.  There was none...
B008B9EC38|4|These look very good and were easy to install.  The only thing I really don't like is that the acutal mirror is flat and that is not what I'm used to.  My husband thinks the chrome looks cheap and will chip off but we will have to wait and see. I like the look.
B00RW4KG1A|5|This was exactly what the doctor ordered; I had them installed by my mechanic and they look great. However as with all wheel covers, be reminded that they are only plastic and not very sturdy. One of them cracked slightly while being installed but after being glued back and spray painted looked good enough to not be a big deal. TKS again!
B00K8LET9Y|1|I plugged them in and they started smoking. They are junk.
B007QF16BO|5|Received it installed it works good
B004LKU5LY|5|Best mirrors on the road here in Albuquerque nm!
B00F23BNUG|4|No bulb warning light in my 1995 Lexus SC400 when used as reverse lights. I wish they were brighter; the window tint makes it hard to see when backing up at night.
B008SEBQ2G|1|Poor reception, was expecting something that would look good but deliver the same range, not this product.
B0068FY4ZI|5|Great product!! At the tender age of 68 with 54year of riding experience, this is he finest helmet I have owned.
B003YOWF2K|5|Was exactly as advertised.  Would order from them again.
B00CQAQZWE|4|Great replacement. Easy to install.
B000MWU3QM|5|happy with the performance
B000GVGJA8|5|Pipes are very loud. Awesome for people who want loud.
B004FJKDP4|5|Fits perfectly in my 2013 Accord Coupe LX-S !<br />Knowing that I will have my wheels when I return to my car gives the piece of mind !
B003LS15XY|5|Perfect fit in my 2014 kia forte ex sedan. Ive had these in my other cars and find they pay for themselves within 3 years. I dint notice a difference in gas mileage or power at all its the same.
B00LDBJS8U|5|The BEST drying chamoise...been using these for years. 👍🏻
B0040CYWX0|5|Worked perfectly in saturn sl1
B007I7G0VQ|5|Amazing everything amazing. Sent extra ball bearings which i did need. Easy fast and right the first time. I'm so recommending to any g8 that's looking.
B003Z4BBSI|5|Really happy with these googles. They fit well and the lens are still clear after cleaning off the road grime. Have only used them for a couple months. Because of the price and quality I have stocked up on them.
B000B8GAKA|5|Just a little worried about the plastic... I just hope it doesn't melt, do not think it will. for the price I paid, it does a great job
B00DHQ65D0|5|nice buy would buy again thanks
B0073ME6BC|5|fit in the car and is direct replacement for the one i had.  easy installation
B000CAVQ3S|5|Terrific product for my Honda Accord. Took 5 minutes to change and had an immediate effect on reducing my allergies!! Embarrassed to say the filter in my car was old and dirty.
B00VJ14JYW|5|Reduces recoil. Quality build and finish. Pleased with the product.
B002SIR91A|5|This shovel arrived quickly when no stores around hand anything similar to its quality. This shovel will come in handy the next time I get stuck. Hopefully never but if I do it will do the trick. Very durable and light with multiple lengths possible with a nice T handle.
B001341K92|1|so dissatisfied. I got it and was so excited and 4 of the the gems were off and there was a crack in it.
B00480J4KA|5|I replaced the low beam on my Volvo XC90 V8 with this and its works great. Sooo much cheaper than a factory replacement.
B0041CG50M|1|Completely misleading. What good is the base if you can't buy the gun racks.
B004K27FNE|1|does NOT fit my 2012 Jeep Rubicon, Not even close.  Screws came rusty. Unacceptable.  The concept is great but check closely to see if it works with your vehicle, don't take amazons word for it.
B00CPGQ2DG|5|I live in rural Alaska and we have lots of gravel/sand/mud roads in the rural and sometimes town areas. I live down 1/4 mile of gravel road from the paved hiway. My drive and parking area my shop and garage is topped with crushed rock over gravel/sand. A normal bike kickstand will sink right in and dump your baby on the ground. I attached 4 ft of nylon cord to this in the hole on the round end and I carry it in my bike pocket. When I need to park off pavement, I pull it out and drop it on the ground and position it under my kickstand with my foot. When I get off the bike, I loop the cord over the handle bar, so when I remount, I just pull it up and stick it back in my pocket.
B009FVPY9C|4|I like it enough, I wish I would have paid attention to the color and chosen a black one to match my car's belt color. It's a little hard to tighten but it does the job that I needed....
B002X9V7YE|3|Nice
B009ZXC3MQ|1|Don't buy this product trust me, Caltric is a peace of s*** company.  Stick with the OEM parts your bike came with.  Remember u get what you pay for.
B0041CDPQO|5|If you are tired of your battery dieing while out riding...this is a must have!  Keep it on you at all times.
B000FJU5CE|1|THE PICTURE SHOWS THAT IT HAS A HOLDER ....IT DOES NOT HAVE ONE WITH IT ... THE HOLDER EVEN HAS THE CLIP CLAP LOGO ON IT SO I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT HAD ITS OWN HOLDER .. KIND OF LOOKED TO ME LIKE IT ATTACHED TO A VENT..NOT REAL HAPPY WITH PRODUCT... YOU SHOULD UP DATE THE PICTURE AND SPECIFY THAT LOOKS CAN BE DISCEIVING
B00EQ4IQ7U|4|The McGard Lower Unit Lock Set is the same as sold by Yamaha. Looks like quality stainless steel through out. Once installed it can be left on the engine permanently. Boat may be operated without any additional drag or interference because this bolt is installed within the lower unit housing. A little more effort to install than other external solutions but not complicated or difficult.
B003YJCE9E|5|Easy to fit - performed better than expected.  Recommended for all RVs and trailers but internal plumbing must be able to take the extra pressure.
B00029CYRG|5|I used the Meguiar's M6732  followed by M6332. The results were spectacular on my older Truck Camper. It removed all the old wax and oxidization and restored it to a beautiful new shine. The wax enhanced and protected it and made it shine even more. A lot of work, but I used my husband's sander with the orange compounding pad and it made it easier . My camper looks like it came right off the showroom floor. Amazing stuff !!!! Highly recommend !
B00SDXONI6|4|Great power supply I used it over a weekend on a 12V cooler that draws 4.5 amps.  It does get HOT though.
B0002MBA28|5|My husband is an avid eagle collector. He was VERY surprised and well pleased when I gave him this for his truck for a birthday gift. Nice weight of metal and chrome. Looks more expensive than what I paid for it. Would buy agin.
B000VKTULY|5|Love it; cheap, original (even though it says TYC, it is perfectly genuine quality). Worked great on my 2010 Corolla. Don't pay the money to the dealer. Watch any youtube video and install this cheap filter yourself.
B000CQOIQE|4|Good
B00697T83I|5|The cargo mat fit perfectly, and was very easy to install! With two large dogs, it provides stability for them, and protection for my Highlander.
B00EEGBUDM|4|There sturdy and easily to install
B001GH5OMU|5|This is exactly what I thought it would be after researching this and other companies, perfect fit and function! Highly recommended
B000C7TZM0|5|Very well made.  Strong steel, no bolts with this kit.  Theses are made in China, but they are very well made.  I sprayed mine with under body coating from Rustoleum before putting in the new tank and straps.  That way they last so much longer.  These are not galvanized.  Just plain steel.  But they are heavy duty.
B001JT98S6|5|A decent enough 12 volt power cord. I bought it to use in a small project in my car. Mine measured just a half inch over 6 feet in length before I cut the three pin connector off the end. I checked the fuse in it and found that it was a 15 amp fuse, but rated for 250V. I'll replace it with a 15 amp 32V automotive fuse later. This is a moot point if your vehicle power socket is fused at less than 15 amps. The cord is not as flexible as I would like it to be. But this was the only one I could find with the heavier 14 gauge wire. It comes with a blue light emitting diode in it that illuminates whenever the cord is plugged into a live 12V socket. A handy feature for some people. The LED is bright but not overly so. I haven't tried it in the car's cigarette lighter socket yet, but it seems to have good retention in the 12V power socket my car has. So far I am quite happy with the product and will keep this in mind for future reference.  2017 January 7th. Some additional information. I have been using this since June of 2015 with great success. I built a charger for my notebook computer. I wanted the heavier 14 gauge wire that this has. I noticed a difference in temperature of the tip of the plug from using it in a 12 volt cigarette lighter socket (warm) versus a 12 volt power socket. (cool) Stick with a dedicated 12 volt accessory power socket.
B00GLQ58AE|5|Perfect fit and great price.  I will buy more.
B001O22NVM|4|Lots of install hardware, instructions were pretty clear.  Quality of the box and install hardware was very good.  I have installed and been using this for a month.  It does what they say it does.  Once your used to the software interface it's very easy to tune.  Excellent feature set for the money.  If you want a digital ignition and you have a supercharger this is a no brainer purchase.  you need a MAP sensor, I bought the MSD one.  Just made it easy.  Would have preferred a more modern com standard but as an old school geek, serial ports are solid and very easy to use so I like them, and I have all the adapters I need and laptops with 9pin serial ports so.......  But then usb would have made more sense for todays devices and users.  Just realize you will need to buy a usb to serial adapter, no way around it unless you have a device with a serial port.  I use a made in USA one that I use at work and its flawless. http://www.usconverters.com/usb-serial-adapter-xs880
B00ASBYYHQ|3|They are ok, no where near as bright as the original bulbs. (Same brightness as if you had tint on your lenses).
B00062YPJE|5|bought this for my yamaha g2 golf cart. the air box was missing and this was a lot cheaper option. have owned k&n filters in the past, and if the quality is still there (which i suspect it is) it should give years of good service.
B002XL2IBS|5|Super!!  Just what I had been looking for.  It works great!!
B00T6JALBO|5|Very well put together, very comfortable, and very bright!!! Great outward visibility. The only thing I can complain about is the chin curtain and the way it attaches to the shell. It appears a bit stressed with little use. I will probably remove it and save it for the colder weather ... before it decides to remove itself. They are available as spares for under $15USD. For the money, I think the helmet is an excellent value. I would recommend and repurchase it at the time of this writing. Two thumbs up!
B000BYD3RC|5|This Distributor Cap works as the OEM should and I have no problems with it.  Great product and will use next time my Yukon needs a tune up (142,000 miles and first tune up).
B003IS3HV0|5|This review is for both the cleaner and the conditioner. First, I was impressed that I received two emails from this family owned company, thanking me for my business and providing additional instructions on how to use the products.  My old, beat up, but beloved leather boots now look amazing! The leather is softer and has a rich patina that looks great. I cleaned the boots with the Honey Leather Cleaner and allowed them to dry overnight.  I used the Honey Leather applicator cloth to apply the conditioner, lightly rubbing it in; easy to apply and a little goes a long way. I let the conditioner soak in over night and this morning there was no sticky residue. However, I lightly buffed with a clean microfiber cloth; they look great and are ready to wear. All of my leather boots are going to receive the same care, sooner rather than later!    When the weather warms up, I am going to tackle the leather seats in my SUV. I wish I had purchased this product sooner!    12/2 - I used the cleaner and conditioner on a second pair of shoes. A word of caution - these shoes where a somewhat light brown and they darkened significantly. I liked the way looked after just using the cleaner, and while I do not dislike them after conditioning, I wish I had stopped with merely cleaning. These are older, mid-range, casual booties, so I am not unhappy with the results; however, I will be cautious with new leather, depending on the color.
B00HYJFTLA|4|Didn't bolt onto my 2006 Jetta tdi, It may be intended for a automatic because mine is a 5-speed. The fans bolted right on to my original assembly and the motors work great!
B0081HPGBW|5|Item was delivered as expected and at a great price.
B000Z4IFU8|5|I bought the U7193 for my '03 GMC Yukon XL.  Prior to the tune, the Yukon was a little sluggish accelerating from a stop and MPGs were a little lack luster.  I installed the 87 octane tune and immediately noticed a difference.  I don't have any real statistics on performance but the acceleration seems a lot more responsive.  I think some of this is due to the tune altering shifting parameters but that is just my speculation.  Prior to the tune, my wife's weekly MPG average was about 12.5mpg on her short commute, all city, to work and back.  On long trips, we would get around 14-15mpg.  After the tune, it seems like the city mpgs have went up slightly to around 13-13.5.  On a 1,200+ mile round trip vacation we noticed an average of 16mpg.  However, the speed limit was 70mph on most of the highway portions of the trip.  Best fuel economy seems to be around 60-65mpg with an instant mpg around 18-19mpg which used to be around 17-18mpg.  Certainly not a massive increase in MPGs but a noticeable amount.  I figure at a .5 - 1mpg increase the tuner will have paid for itself in about a year.  If you're looking to make your vehicle perform better, a tuner is the way to go.  You will see an increase in MPGs if you can resist stomping on the accelerator at every chance otherwise you will see a decrease over stock tuning.
B00MJ40ZHI|3|Ok for the money. Buy cheap get cheap.
B005UGGWJ2|5|Cant get enough of that smell !! love it
B000C0YMX4|5|I bought this for my 1995 Chevy Camaro V6 3.8L with air conditioner. For those who were wondering whether it has it or not, yes this belt comes with AC. Seems very durable and my mechanic said it was a good brand. Buy it off Amazon and save a lot of money rather than buying somewhere else. Highly recommend this product if you are in need of a belt.
B00R53J1DW|5|Key Fit and work perfect. Just had to have key cut. Great Savings! Very pleased
B003X6HPG0|3|The coating isn't with the extra money, it just flakes off and rusts. Better bet would be to but the black ones and have them coated, or just let them rust. Other than that they fit perfectly, mine have held up for 3 years and are still sound, just a bit ugly.
B000FGJR1W|5|Exact fit and can feel the power it allowed me to unleash.
B002UJVNFA|5|What a bargain ... All three shades for any riding condition . Well made sturdy and fit great ... I'm giving em as Xmas gifts.
B000ARKIAA|5|Kozak work great as usual. Fair price quick shipping.
B000C9SOHK|1|Rotor broke while installing, the contact is just slipped on the end.  Avoid.
B002FYS2DG|5|The lights are great, they are easy to install.  No problems with the lights. the price is reasonable compared to other brands.
B000IYWXNU|1|Got one mail ordered, not from Amazon. I was expecting an item that looks like what is on here, identical to a Japanese made cap, and I got an Israeli knock off.
B006B266FO|5|Great brake pads. Am using on my Honda NC750XA. can feel the difference between stock pads and this sintered HH pads. riding with confidence now!
B004LF13GA|4|Not an exact replacement for my existing unit.  After a little sawing it did fit in the old location.  The install instructions were somewhat lacking.  But  I did get it installed correctly and the unit is working good
B00020BM28|4|great, so good!
B001BN5EME|1|You see this same pan sold by different companies. It looks and fits great, but doesn't perform well. I bought one from Spectre and one from TCI. They both leaked heavily from the same spot. The casting has too many flaws
B00GEY28LA|3|I do have a few little issues with the lift.  There is no grease points on any of it.  I also had to cut the trim on my golf cart so the tires wouldn't rub.  It calls for tires up to 24&#34; however I got 22&#34; on mine and I had to cut the trim.  I ordered this particular one because it was cart specific ( Yamaha drive electric or gas) if I knew I was going to have to trip and not have grease points I would have went with a universal kit and saved myself $225.  Other than these two issues it looks great
B00P89HBT6|5|Purchased this for a two day car trip.  Worked great for snacks, plastic ware, napkins, etc.  Yes the accent color is more purple than pink but I could less what color it is.  It functioned exactly how I needed it to.  I did not find it flimsy and I liked that it could be customized with the Velcro dividers.  Really good product for us.
B00AC6Y8U0|5|I have a 1992 bmw K75S and this tank bag fits very well.  The construction seems to be pretty durable, and it is easy to install.  Really like the clear top that allows me to put my GPS in there, but the only problem is that it overheats so I need to leave the bag open a bit while i ride to ventilate.<br />Has a lot of space in it, and don't even notice the bag underneath me, which i was worried about since it looks so tall in the pictures.<br /><br />Overall very satisfied, and I will give a follow-up review once I come back from my cross country trip!
B000Z0HVHA|5|great job
B001VNUZOG|5|Consider that I am a DIY home fixer as you read this review.<br /><br />For years I have done business with the largest plumbing supply company in my town of 500,000, have an account with them, and consider their advice to be near golden. For all those years I have maintained a sewage sump pump in our basement which has required replacement of the 2&#34; check valve about every 10 or so years. The last one this supply house sold me had a spring in it, operating a ball type valve, and it was relatively quiet and flawless in operation until years later the ball seat began to leak. So, I went back to buy another only to be told: &#34;You don't want a spring operated valve!&#34; A web search brought this check valve to my attention and you can understand my consternation when I read that it was operated by a stainless steel spring. Well, I just finished installing it and my response is one word: WOW. The thing is so quick and quiet that I have to stand next to it to know if it is working.<br /><br />So what about the spring problem? Well, remember the last one the supply house sold me was spring operated? It lasted years, and reading up on the subject showed me that several companies now manufacture large, up to 11 or more inches, spring operated check valves for industry. So, I am willing to take my chances. In the meantime, my sump pump, house, and occupants are enjoying the gentle closing of the valve, rather than the wall rattling jarring typical of flapper style valves.<br /><br />2016 UPDATE: This check valve has been flawlessly working since it was installed and I am happy it is still stocked by Amazon.
B0002RQ8W0|5|Nice product
B0013REXSY|4|Got what I expected
B00EECLOT6|5|Price is awesome, works just as well as the ones you buy in the auto parts store, but only a fraction of the cost for the set. Love the option of tints for the bulbs.
B008ADQ7HE|5|This set is perfect. All the emblems fit perfectly in their base plates and look great. I used them on a 325i
B001FAK4EG|4|works well
B000C3ZDQ6|5|These shocks are the best that are available.  They add a lot of stabilty to the truck.  Buy some now.
B000C2ACUY|5|Again quality product from FELPRO gasket pro's. Before I bought this check with agent price of MOPAR is too much US $. So I decides to buy this, not much different from MOPAR. FELPRO also very good gasket in the market. Packing also great for delivery any where. Thank you Amazon and FELPRO gaskets. I can replace my 17 year old Jeep Wrangler 97 4.0 head gasket. It's already now 300,000 KM running without any engine repairs. Basic engine tuning kits and MOPAR oil pump and regular oil change every 3500 KM with Pennzoil 10W 30 with MOPAR MO 90 oil filter. AMC 4.0 engines are the best....
B000HZFDQ4|5|Great product.  Easy to install.  Highly recommended.  These come in a great little bag complete with gloves.  Everything you need to get to the mountains and back safely.
B0011N1TDC|5|Great product. Great price. Thanks Amazon.
B0027ERH8U|5|Fit my 2005.5 Audi A4, 3.2L (B7) perfectly. I'll get a few more next time.
B00D9L0XSQ|3|It was much lighted than the picture, actually a baby pink, but the flake is awesome.  It's also starting to fade, but I don't mind much. Fit was great.
B000071NUM|3|This item is a nice tool and made of good quality stuff, but I didn't find it useful for car cleaning.
B00607JX1O|5|Very simple vinyl decal sticker but it perfectly stuck on the car window.  I appreciated the instructions it came with on how to apply.  Great.
B000WJX4BQ|5|I got five years out of the oem Yuasa, it was still reliably starting my Concours 14 when I put the new one in. The acid tubs are a pretty neat design, very easy to use
B007VYHGK0|5|excellent
B00BQYCJNU|5|great
B000CB6CMC|5|I own a Porsche 911. I have learned that there are many great products out there that do not say &#34;OEM&#34; on them........... do they work?  Are they as good as OEM? The answer is Yes!<br /><br />Why pay for OEM.. I have better things to do with my legal tender than pay 2 to 3 times the amount I need to pay for quality. I use MANN oil filters also in the Porsche... and I drive it hard, so I want the best protection possible!
B006XGHNGE|5|U need to make sure that the stepper shaft is turned all the way to the left to work correctly.  Stick needle on lightly and turn til it stops.  Remove needle and align it to where it should start at.
B000FSTKAS|5|Pros - Increase in HP and MPG, hesitation gone, Easy install,<br /><br />Cons - None, can not find them locally.<br /><br />I got one of these for me 91 GMC Sonoma which is a fuel injected Carburetor, yes they call a carbed engine fuel injected, Truck.<br /><br />I went from 19 mpg to 21 mpg and a noticeable increase in acceleration.  The truck use to hesitate when leaving red lights, press the pedal and it would hesitate then lurch off the line.<br /><br />The hesitation disappeared, and I was really pleased with the increase in MPG.  It is even better on the highway.<br /><br />It may be that they work with carbed vehicles and not todays fuel injected.<br /><br />I will know soon enough when I get one for my 06 CRV.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Older Carburetor vehicles.  It does work I have had mine for over 10 yrs with no problems.
B0009IBJAS|5|This charger works great on my '49 Packard 6-volt positive ground system.  If you have an old car, you know that sometimes the things we buy these days don't work with the old iron. This little charger works great. A plus is that you can leave the connectors hooked up to your battery permanently. You just plug the charger's connector into the leads. Great product.
B00LBIUMI0|5|takes them maybe 7 seconds to completely warm up but they get bright
B007KPWQBE|5|nice looking and works as it should
B00CEL47Q6|3|Was informed that these fit a 99 Honda Accord by amazon. They do fit on the knobs but they dont go all the way down like the originals so it leaves about a 2 or 3 mm gap where light shines out when u turn on the headlights. I find it a bit distracting but some might like the look.
B0016LEAVM|5|~$8 for a 3oz bottle doesnt seem like a lot. well it isnt.<br />glad i bought 2 to save on shipping. (+ another item)<br /><br />i feel like this works better then the Rain-x.<br />but that stuff cost ~$5 for a huge bottle.<br /><br />the trick is to get the surface really really clean.<br />i applied it after a car wash and then really buff it down with windex (isopropyl alcohol works well too)<br /><br />with a clean microfiber cloth work the solution in. its highly evaporative so work fast.
B008KZKDYA|5|They arrived quickly, fit perfectly and look great. Plus a lot cheaper than from the dealer. They are also are or at least look like original equipment.
B002VPA5IY|5|THIS IS A FACTORY UNIT.THE ITEM CAME IN AC-DELCO BOX.THE ITEM FIT WITH NO PROBLEMS & IT WAS A GREAT PRICE
B004L04NLM|5|If your travels take you and family members across bridges or near waterways, this is a must-have item in your car for peace of mind.  This brand is very solid and of good quality.  Get one for every automobile owner you love, and install within reach of the driver for quick use if ever needed when escape from a car door is not possible due to water immersion or other emergency.
B0024NO97Q|5|These replacement lights completely changed the appearance of my wife's car.  Not only do they look great, they really improved night-time visibiliy, and safety.  This upgrade took about two hours to complete, so I wouldn'nt call it easy, but with a little mechanical ability and patience it is do-able.  A great investment, and an amazing improvement.
B004HAEFS2|5|Bright and functions well...haven't had the trailer in water yet but they look great on a vintage boat trailer
B000C9N54C|5|Arrived quickiy. Now my truck starts when it is cold.<br />Carl
B007OW66PK|5|I am hoping that I can get another one at the same price at the same location? I really hope so.
B001F0GZZ8|5|Cleans the white vinyl in our boat with not a lot of hard scrubbing.
B002TTU96A|4|very good just what i wanted
B000182ESM|5|The price was great, super fast shipping, and it was installed in under 6 minutes. Besides it enhances our Suburban's appearance!
B0002STSQM|4|pros  -it works.  -it feels like an expensive pen  -fair price /w free shipping    cons  -the measurement marks aren't all in one line, so you have to turn the cylinder to read exact measurement.  -it's shipped drenched in oil. i ragged down everything except inside cylinder...at least i know it won't dry out any time soon!
B001KO2H6U|5|Haven't tried it yet but it seems legit.  Quality is very well made and seems to be designed as advertised.  Can't wait to strap down my bike.
B000CNH4YK|5|Two of the gaskets in the set were slightly damaged, but otherwise, the set included almost everything needed for a good, clean installation. Fel-Pro is a brand I've never had problems with.
B001CEG90I|5|good replacement for original. 2nd time purchasing this item. fast delivery
B0076QX8KA|1|I used this gun to grease 13 dump truck one day a week and it breaks after 3 or 4 weeks of use consistently. we bought 2 of these guns and had each one rebuilt 3 or 4 times. Save yourself the time and money and buy the dewalt 18v Ive been using it for a couple months now with no problems.
B003WDDLTO|5|Worked great
B00ADV9SLS|1|It's been shown time and time again that these \\"electric superchargers\\" don't and can't work. No one has a credible dyno test to show that these things do anything but reduce the output of your engine by creating a huge restriction in airflow. There is no small electric motor/fan combo that can even begin to move the volumes of air necessary to create a supercharging effect, yet we continue to see this junk for sale. Electric superchargers are not only silly, they are a complete waste of time and money.
B000IY5H5Q|1|Fuel sensor went out two months after installing this pump.  Fuel gauge reads empty all the time now.
B002O14GKI|3|This was exactly what I was looking for but when I opened the package there was a piece of plastic missing from the top of the emblem. There was no plastic pieces in the bag so it wasn't damaged in the mail, it was send that way. Disappointed & will not be buying anything else from this dealer.
B005GQ6O94|3|I expected more.  The mats fit fine, but I thought there a spout that dispelled water.
B0091VOABO|3|First and foremost I just started my detailing business, and I love trial period for different items because it allows me to disassociate bad items from my own personal arsenal. I just used this polish yesterday, because it was the first time in weeks it decided not to rain in the Eastcoast, on my personal vehicle. I am not going to sit here and say this item plane blank did not work because that would be misleading. One thing I realize when considering any item on the net nothing is perfect, and reviews are subjective way for one to assist others in selecting best items for their needs so please keep that in mind while reading this review, my appreciations. Prior to receiving this item I was genuinely excited because the item description stated \\"polymers and microfine polishing agents that quickly remove - not hide - scratches and swirls to restore your paint to pristine condition.\\" Being the curious individual I am, I decided to give it a try so I made the purchase, and as I stated earlier I was excited. These were the following steps completed before using this polish. I washed the vehicle using Adam's shampoo, succeeded with a thorough wipe down using a premium microfabric cloth purchased from ([...] I soon followed that up with clay bar with lubricate to remove excess dirt and tree sap. Upon completion I prep the paint using P21S Paintwork cleaners. I then thoroughly wipe down the vehicle again to make sure the paint work was excellent and had no excess dirt, tree sap or road grime. The polisher I used with this item was random orbital polisher along with Orange Light Cutting CCS Smart PadsTM Da 6.5 Inch Foam Pad from Lake country. I have to say after hours of working on this vehicle looking directly at the vehicle all the visible swirls were polished off or so I thought, a great result for the first time using this item. Soon the night came I moved the car to my compound and turned on all the HD lights to make sure nothing hides from my naked eye. Come to my bewilderment I still had swirl that were hidden because of the high gloss this polish resultant. I will try this item again, but this time I am going to use a rotary motor, polisher which produced much power and faster speed time with a much greater RPM. I truly do hope this review helped you in some form for making a tough decision for enthusiasts, if you guys need me to post pictures I can do so please comment if needed.
B001AM8GLM|5|These work great on older cars.
B0083G3AXC|5|Very sturdy, high-quality construction<br />Super simple design<br />Exceptionally stable when mounted<br />Could not be easier to mounted & dismount from chair!
B000C6MMDK|3|Made in China.  I'd rather spend the few bucks more, save some American jobs and get the Motorcraft FG800A which is made in the USA.  Also, Motorcraft lists the filtering specs, Purolator does not.
B00XZ9MYFM|5|I bought this as a replacement for my old key fob which I had since 2005. This fits perfectly and looks nice and clean.
B001CF1A7O|4|I wanted one for a 2.5&#34; Hitch (Ram 2500) but this one will do. I will need to use a 2.5 to 2&#34; reducig sleeve (which came with my truck). It's solid metal feels great. You will require a hitch pin. Not sure how the paint will hold up but my intent is to keep this in my truck as an emergency.
B003Y80DCU|5|Very good stuff
B0028UIO3A|2|my order was not the same in the pitcure.. it was a tribal godsmark decal.. i was unpleased with the product
B004GE6RMG|5|Great fit. Fast shipping
B00390X6DQ|4|I decided to take a chance on this Rugged Ridge cowl since I had received a gift card from work thinking that this would be a worthless piece of plastic.  I was wrong and knowing what I know now I would have gladly dropped my own hard-earned cash to buy it.<br /><br />First impressions:  The package that arrived stated this fit 2007-2010 although I ordered the one that supposedly fit my 2012.  I have no idea whether or not there are two different versions or I just got one of the older packages that's been sitting in a warehouse for years.  Once unpacked, the cowl is made of decent thickness plastic and should withstand getting whacked by the inevitable tree branches on the trail or road debris.<br /><br />Installation: The fit isn't perfect on a 2012, but you'd have to be the one installing it to ever notice that it is slightly too narrow.  I mounted it with the opening facing the windscreen.  3M tape comes attached along the entire mounting surface and holds this thing down like a 500lb gorilla.  This is definitely a one shot install because the plastic cowl will probably give up before the tape does.<br /><br />Performance: I noticed an appreciable increase in heating capability on the freeway when I really needed it for creating the &#34;heat bubble&#34; on cold mornings with the top and doors off.  This cowl seems to provide a one click of the fan dial increase across the band when traveling at highway speeds.  The latter part is important here; if you spend 90% of your time tooling around town or on the trail at low speeds this will be another piece of plastic that some may think looks cool (if they even notice it).<br /><br />Appearance: I initially thought this cowl may look a little odd, but I was wrong.  It took my wife a few days to even notice it and she is always looking for new parts on it.  Since it is between the wipers and near the windscreen, this blends in to fairly well unless you are looking for it.  From the driver's seat you can not see it.
B001SG7U2G|5|good
B001TZP0AA|5|This is a complete assembly, has the factory orifice, pressure sensor, and comes sealed up ready to install with the o rings. You have to pull the compressor to install this hose or be part Houdini.  But looking at the aftermarket hoses out there lead me to this part number.  Much cheaper that going to a dealership, much better fit than going to an aftermarket.
B006X8B5SO|4|Excelent
B00280ALCC|2|Leaves much more dust on wheels than I expected.Also squeel and grab when cold and wet after sitting overnight outside. Wearing good,stops good.
B001C5MEZ6|5|This is my 2nd time purchasing this because my first one was stolen-- it's a very basic item but does what it's supposed to do perfectly. I usually wear it when riding my motorcycle in colder weather, and it keeps my neck comfy.
B003FFP2X2|5|Works as advertised. Retrieves error codes. Resets warning lights. But you still need to have your airbags checked by a competent professional.
B0015PG5NU|5|It built rigid, very strong and light in weight. I do not have any problem using it.<br />Recommended for a shop.
B00G6ILXQU|1|Installed on: 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT<br /><br />Well made. The tubing and flanges are a bit thinner than OEM cat, however it still feels like a good quality OE spec cat that should last a few years. Installed it myself in one weekend afternoon. Will try to provide an update after one year.<br /><br />Other tips:<br />- gaskets NOT included<br />- bolts NOT included<br />- if you're attempting installation yourself, make sure you have all the tools such as oxygen sensor wrench, angle grinder, etc<br /><br />Update 4/3/2016:<br />So it's been about 2 years since I installed this catalytic converter. Metal mesh that covers the short flex pipe is now torn apart, probably not long until first hole appears in the actual flexible pipe. I should mention that during the past 2 years my car has been stored and not moved for a full year. I've done maybe 4-5 thousand miles on this new catalytic converter.
B005SUW17M|5|exelent
B005MUQI54|5|This product is amazing. We frequently our motorcycles and I like to wipe the road grime and bugs off frequently so that our bikes look good and the suicidal bugs don't damage the finish on the paint or chrome.  These cloths have cut the time I spend doing this by at least half. They work on the faring, the chrome and windshield with out streaking or leaving a residue.<br />They are a must have for any motorcyclist.
B00412YYVO|4|Great fit no problem installing.
B004I0DB9A|5|Bolted right up to moms pathfinder - quick fix pops in and plugs in and it was like new.  Been installed 6 weeks and still doing good.
B00068XCQU|5|good product - great price
B001U7G7N6|5|Item as expected, fast delivery!
B00JA3BMDW|5|item does what it's supposed to do works good
B00E0FRU0O|5|Used it for 3 days in Chicago's cold so far and I have to say it capped me worm
B00GYTEC14|5|Replaced old filter perfectly.
B009A9SW9I|1|it did not fit.
B000TK1U82|5|perfect
B0010E00T6|3|There was no difference in filtered smell  compared with standard filters, but otherwise it fits and replaces the original well.
B00480N0SC|5|Definitely improved visibility. Great product for a great price. Saved about 30 dollars over how much they were at Wal Mart.
B003L36UGQ|5|Very satisfied
B007PYFFXQ|5|Easy to apply and looks great! So far stands up against weather just fine
B001AP15SU|5|product works great, will buy again if needed.
B0009RUXBU|5|The product was new & it was everything I expected & wanted. It was the best price & I got it in 2days.
B00DWKYWFO|5|The HID bulbs, really makes night driving a lot easier.  You can really see at night.  I mean really see everything.
B0027988HE|1|One spark plug box was empty, although the card board appeared to be of acceptable quality. Just wish it included the actual spark plug. Giving 1 star because 0 isn't an option.
B0040AE7WS|5|Great looking little chrome piece. Adhesive works well to vehicle.<br />I put it on the curved area of my trunk, so the chrome piece has started to peel off from the adhesive. I am going to throw a dab of super glue in there to remedy.
B0014YFBMS|5|We VINE-ers were offered these blind, only given a measurement with which to guess compatibility. Luckily the ANCO C-21-UB was just what I needed! (and I WILL be buying another for the other side!)<br /><br />My vehicle is always outside, so I go through wipers regularly. It doesn't seem to matter how much I spend==cheap or expensive==there is always a smear left on the glass, or the darn things just one day split and fall off.<br />We haven't had any extreme weather since I got the wiper blade until today, so my review was that I was happy with how clean the wiper blade leaves my windshield from bug guts and morning dew. Tonight on the way home however, a sudden downpour blasted my car and visibility was down to just about nothing. It's always during times like this that I find out my wiper blade is rotten or ill-fitting, however I was able to keep plugging on in near-zero-visibility thanks to this FABULOUS Anco blade! Tomorrow I'm getting another for the passenger side. If you've never had to listen to the sound of a wiper blade skipping and splatting across the glass, or experienced one that just rubs the water all over instead of clearing it, you may not understand how thrilled I am with this blade! But if you've had to pull over and pull the wiper arm away from your car because the blade fell off and all you hear is metal scraping your windshield?? You'll definitely know what I mean.<br /><br />Love the quality and ease of installation--even I could do it, and I normally have the dealership do it, or take the O'Reilly guy up on his offer of free installation.
B00M093INK|5|Very expensive looking case, fits over key perfit, love it
B007RRS6A0|3|The color is right.  I can use the brush fine, but the roller ball tip never works for me (which would be better for tiny rock chips).
B000CIY0U6|5|I just bought this to protect my tail gate from objects hitting it.<br />It keep the pain new and area dent free.
B001UOYNK8|3|Our car smells strongly of coffee and cigarettes. This product seems to work at first, but really just covers the odor with a stronger &#34;chemical bubble gum&#34; smell. Then the odor comes back. We have used it twice- will probably try one more time before we give up!
B0066RZ4QG|5|Perfect replacement for the original overflow bottle.  Installed in about 2 minutes with ease.  Can't go wrong with this unit for the price.  Highly reccomend.
B005ZZH7G0|1|Does not fit my 2007 Toyota Tacoma, extended cab, size 15 wheels, wrong fit.  Amazon, the info on the web says it is a fit.  Please correct this info, had to return and again look for the right fit.  Absolutely, nothing against the performance.
B0066S8MYQ|1|This headlight is not the Xenon (which is pretty much standard for Volvo). After buying it I was obliged to buy another one (lost 250$)
B001GRSTRM|5|These mats work great. Snow and rain stay in the pan. I've had three coffee spills that would have cost me a couple of hundred to get shampooed out!!! I recommend them!!! I own a 2011 HHR LT.
B000C5G5RK|5|Matches the original. One tip: the GM manual says to heat the part with a heat gun to make it fold and latch more easily. That really helps.
B000OCIU4M|3|Threads on cap are non-standard size and difficult to get started straight.  Drum Wrench helps, but better threads could make this product a home run.  Pump works well and saves you from lifting tank to drain final gallon(s)
B00YD5JRG6|5|Great product I put these on my 2003 Ford F250 Super Duty 4x4.  I saw some reviews on some 2 inch spacer and guys were saying they did not cover the studs complety and they had to trim the studs off... &#34;thats 32 studs&#34;.  These went on quick and easy.  I found a brand new set of stock wheels and tires off of a 2014 Ford F250 on craigs list, got them for $850.00.  The wheels had to have spacers because the 2014 wheels are inset alot and will hit the tie rod end.  Once I got these on, the new wheels fit perfect, and they don't stick out at all because of the inset of the wheels.  They make the truck look like a normal truck.  One last note my F250 had 14x1.5 studs on it.  If you are not sure about what you have, take one lug nut to your NAPA parts store etc., and let them tell you what you have.  14 is the size and 1.5 is the thread count, some smaller trucks may have 14x2 threads on them, of course these are metric.  I found out the hard way about this.  I ordered my first set from partsdeal, and their site said that they would fit my truck and they were &#34; 2 inch 8x170 14x1.5&#34;.  They did not fit, and it cost me 48.00 return shipping and 15.00 restocking and had to call them to get them to credit me the rest back.  I will never buy from partsdeal again.... ever!
B00062YVL6|5|Amazon was the only place that I could find this type of panel.  Exactly what I was looking for.
B000RXKR6M|3|works good but my wife found a similar product at the dollar store the next week
B0029TQDLA|4|One of the best purchases ever.
B000786GLM|4|dry too fast otherwise is a good product
B00B2YHFO2|3|Quality:  OK<br />Brightness:  OK<br /><br />I had a few of them not work when I received them, but otherwise the function.  Not quite as bright as I was hoping.
B007JVXHD0|5|I got this is a gift for my sister since she just got a new Jeep. She parks it in a garage and needs to fob in every day. With the valet key chain, she can quickly remove the fob from her key chain without having to take her car key out of the ignition. She is very happy with it!
B0002F9YI2|5|For too long I listened to squeaky leather in my home theater chairs. After using  this product, ouila, the squeak is gone.<br />Just wish I knew bout this before. Love it
B0049TY5D6|5|Best clutch ever!
B000BLJM9S|5|I was skeptical of this product as to how effective it would be on cleaning my garage floor. Don't get me wrong, it's not a power washer but it's surprisingly powerful and I don't consider the water pressure at my home to be too high. I have a dog who eats in the garage and sometimes can't help but relieve herself while she's out there. She always goes in the same spot and I don't get around to cleaning it every day. I used to have to haul out the powerwasher to properly clean the area. With this product I simply attach it to the hose and spray away. It's powerful enough to wash away everything including the smell and it now takes me 1 quarter of the time. I can't yet speak for it's longevity but it doesn't seem to be of bad quality. I wouldn't toss it around, I think if one is relatively careful in how they handle and treat this product I think it will hold up. For the price it's well worth it.
B009DK1F7A|5|Went in perfectly
B007AKF8GY|5|Good
B00669NMO0|5|Very nice graphic and quality materials. I am pleased and will buy another one for my wife's car.
B000E6LEIC|5|Wow!  I charged the unit for a couple days, (as suggested by one review) rather than just till the light went green and this morning hooked it up to a powered QSC K-12 speaker (amp is rated at 1000 watts) and a walkman CD player.  I ran this for OVER 7 HOURS at a significant volume, about 50-75% of max.  It was quite loud.  I'm a DJ and intend to use this battery to power this set-up for wedding ceremonies.  I was hoping to get an hour and a half and medium volume, but to have it go 7 hours!!  Wow!  There's some headroom.  It exceeded my expectations by a mile, and I can't say that about too many things
B00080QHMM|2|I have one of the originals without the backlit display, probably 10 years now, and it still works great.  I guess there is some non-replaceable battery inside.  Then I bought two of these new ones for my kids. The replaceable batteries don't last but 2 years or so (I guess that's what the \\"L\\" in the display means, I no longer have whatever instructions came with them.)  But, when I buy $6 of fresh 357 batteries (says they are compatible with LR44), the display still shows \\"L\\"... done that on both gauges I bought.  What a waste, I guess something else is wrong.  Gimme the old non-backlit ones that don't wear out the batteries.<br /><br />The thing works great for a couple years, then nothing.  Not good.
B004BSLNL2|1|If you don't have a pressure gauge, do not buy this item. It is advertised incorrectly and will not be usable.
B000MWKHC2|4|Read the description as I had to send a set back because of the flare. Cost me 6 bucks to return. The higher number (I think it was 002) fit a 2012 F-150 without the flare. Once I had the right ones they were simple to install. The only thing that would make them nicer is if they molded the side facing the tire. As molded, it is a mirror of the rear of the flap.
B00HS0GPAY|5|so far these struts are doing great, ive had them in for a few weeks now<br /><br />it is more of a firm sporty ride compared to previous brand stuts ive had like KYB, but thats fine with me<br /><br />will see how long they hold up! (i live on very bumpy dirt roads)
B003RARWXS|5|this helmet is great. especially for the price. comfortable inside. and doesn't weigh your head down too much, and the wind does not catch the helmet, and yank up so its choking you so it a great helmet. i wish the glass wasn't iridescent, because you cant use it at night. i just take it off and wear goggles. but they work.so, its a good deal.
B000NWA6TU|5|Just what the truck called for
B001G8AIMU|2|low amperage makes slow charge and I'm never sure battery is fully charged except by its' heat.
B00BQLV4UM|5|My husband asked me to order this sticker for his Jeep. It arrived quickly and he is pleased with it.
B00JSJMV38|5|Fits very well
B00BSHESRK|5|I purchased this in 2013 and it still looks brand new well built !
B000CMJP3E|3|Good Product, though material used could be thicker to offer better protection to the carpet below.<br />Mine is already showing signs of stress
B007RQX64C|5|Just what the Doctor ordered my 1100 v star is going strong again. Thank you
B00BGZ2X9Y|5|Would buy again
B004TC1E8M|1|I have very mixed feelings with this item. The shipping was fast but the overall quality of this pump will have you second guessing. I put this pump on my vehicle and immediately my car cranked right up. I was thrilled but not 5 mins later the pump began making this very loud whining noise..I'm like wtf! Another thing I checked was to see if the fuel level sending worked....it does not. I was at a 1/4 of a tank before I put this new fuel pump on and after placing it on the vehicle it said I had 3/4 of a tank. So I drove around about two days with this pump still on the vehicle and one night I tried to crank my vehicle and it would not crank. I'm looking at the fuel level in the car and it's saying I have 1/4 of a tank of gas and my car is not turning over. I missed work because I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on. Something told me to check to see if I really had gas in the vehicle and I did not. I missed missed work! This pump has many flaws. I would say if you don't have the extra money to purchase a better quality pump this still would not be the pump for anyone to buy.  I haven't contacted the sellers of this problem because it was hell getting my tank off and I don't want to go through the procedure of having to replace this pump and getting another one. I will write another review in a couple of weeks just to update you guys further about this pump.
B00N3VGPYS|5|This was an easy install, and the gauge is working perfectly.
B00DJE1JOA|5|Much better than stock. Considered the Clearview ones as well, but having to phone the order in was a bit of a pain.
B000CIV716|5|I use synthetic oil, and Mobil 1 filters. Are they really any better than Fram, etc? The tests I've read seem to indicate they are, and the peace of mind is worth the extra cost.
B003ZOH63W|4|Easy install.  I did get afew more chanels at the campground
B000Q86IQQ|5|Works great! I like the fact that it was made in the us, and the design works flawless... BUY IT&#62;
B000182ES2|5|just what I needed for my SUV protects the hood from bugs and saved me some dollars, it really makes the vehicle look better also
B008A8XMEK|5|High quality decal. Looks great whn applied to tinted window. Is a rub-on type applique so only the decal itself is applied. Very stylish.
B000NCOKZQ|5|Nice product
B00548MICQ|5|The one unexpected use, and the one way I use it the most, is while barbecuing.  I have a stainless steel, gas grill.  There's a long handle in front and I just loop this over the handle.  When I pull up the lid of the grill it lights up the entire grill.  Very handy.
B001GN6QQW|5|Perfect replacement.
B002D7MNZS|4|I purchased this mirror after the dealership gava me a $300 estimate to replace my right side mirror. I've never repaired anything on my car before, but I really could not afford the dealership price, after my mirror arrived, I was ready to go.. The installation was easy, my new mirror was installed and finished in about an hour. For $20!! I highly recommend ....
B00E6YX3KU|3|I bought this key for a 1996 Toyota 4runner looks very nice
B001KS6FPA|5|I can't find these locally, even though my city has what seems to be a dozen automotive part stores.  Installation takes a few minutes, and requires no tools.  These are also the cheapest direct-fit wipers I can find, as I refuse to pay for &#34;specialty&#34; wipers.  They last about 6 months before needing to be changed, which is expected.  Wipers don't last forever and should be changed regularly.
B000BZ4ZZU|5|So far, so good, only been a month so can't speak much for longevity, but it bolted right on, no problem.
B00B9RRZAG|5|Good product. No problems at all. It really met my expectations. Will  order more in the future. Love these lights
B0041TTUMU|5|Nice filter, solid fit.
B00A1502YS|3|It does what you expect. It hold the battery in place. Cool ! It was easy to install and material seems to be of good quality.
B001O07PV2|5|Does not foul in our spreader as store bought ones do.
B008BVZSHA|5|This was a great replacement and easily adapted from my old 3 wire to this new 2 wire hook up.
B0002VAZ34|5|I used novus polish for years but these do have more grit variety to work with. They work well for my plastic solar lights that cloud up after a few years.
B004NSI3YA|5|The fog lights were just like new. I could not have been more pleased. Promptly delivered.I picked up a wiring harness from Advance Auto. They had the adapter plug for the 9005 bulbs in stock.
B001KXN3YQ|4|The product will work if the leak is small, it is nor magic oil, my advise is that for the price of it I would give it a shot.
B001BFO7DO|5|Bolted right up to the vehicle and performed very well.  Have engaged it twice and it worked perfectly. good price,too.
B00COYNWP0|5|If you only knew the power of the blackside, Obama . 5.0 b max wicked now with the black force
B00FMF6KHA|3|Looks good have not put on window yet
B00HJ1VV4C|4|Works fine the o ring sent is very large over stock and the screws didn't match to my threads . Other than that seems to be doing wonderful
B009VNK4AS|5|Perfect size and the best quality I've ever had.
B00BV4JA00|5|Good Transmission pan fit good does not come with a gasket have to get that separate otherwise great product so far
B000BZABRQ|5|I have been a big fan of Timken seals and bearings for a long time and this one is no exception. The bearing is smooth as butter and the perfect size for a Subaru wheel bearing replacement. I used this on left rear wheel of my 01 Impreza without issue. It comes in a Timken box wrapped in plastic to keep dirt from getting into the grease. After putting this on my car I now have a nice quiet ride. Very happy with this bearing even though it is a bit more expensive than others. Timken can be trusted to deliver a great product. Very happy.
B004757NQI|2|I was very disappointed with this product.  One of the parts (the nose) wasn't in the package, and one of the rods holding the wings was bent.  Not worth paying to return, but won't buy from this company again.
B005JQSBOM|3|Love the product but it did not fit on the handle bar of my 2013 Polaris 500 touring one up because of cables.  Ended up mounting it on a golf cart.
B00JI9VZ94|5|Works perfectly, fit just like OEM.
B006IPTOWQ|1|Item did not fit my Santa fe as stated was of money and time
B00FVRIS7Y|4|These door handles were the right color for my Altima.
B00RLGU7TK|5|What a difference the L E D 's make in the car vast improvement over stock lighting. Must get for any car or truck.
B0002M9QK6|4|Replaced the expensive sealed bulb on my wife's nighthawk. They have a much better beam pattern (more concentrated lights in front and to the right) than the older sealed bulbs.  It has a better wide angle dispersion than the original bulbs as well so for cornering it helps alot more than before.  The bulb that comes with is a very good bright bulb and is replaceable!  One problem I had to deal with was that it's a little deeper of a bulb that the original it replaced.  This is in part due to the HB2's connector plug depth, since it had to be placed behind the reflector with the ring/spring thing instead of being part of the lamp. I had to push wiring out of the way to get the lamp to fit into place.  A note to other nighthawk owners, there is a depression on the housing cover where the adjustment screw sits, this keeps the bulb from sitting completely into the ring face.  You can use something hard and bend it back out and it will work. You cannot adjust them left to right as with the original, but you probably knew that.
B000VKTUJQ|5|Installed TYC 800038P cabin air filter today. Perfect fit, fair price, no problems!
B00C7XH1OQ|1|This company, DL Auto - is a complete joke. They jerk  you around and sell subpar products. They jerked me around and stiffed me with junk, while i was left paying legitimate installation people to have to install and then remove it. These people and their products are awful! Save your money and time and go elsewhere to a legit company!
B001EASQ7O|5|Makes installing an aftermarket radio extremely easy.  Definitely essential for aftermarket stereos.  It is a bit tricky to get to fit into the space, but would have been much easier to fit if I had used a single-DIN radio.
B002BA98LO|5|Very comfortable on long trips
B000BPNCD6|4|the covers are great no problem there, but the laces sucked.  they were flimsy & cheap.  threw them away & going to buy some leather boot laces.
B0022ZRABS|5|This was just what I was looking for, to use on bicycle or ATV where I couldn't mount one successfully.  Works great to check on oncoming traffic or keeping track of a friend.
B003RQOVFE|4|Just as expected
B008G3II7U|5|Fit perfectly!
B006QH56GE|5|We just needed a different size for a car we are working on.  These are great batteries and deliver the power we need.
B000JNTEJG|2|I previously mounted a Coastal hitch on my 2006 Prius to use with my Hidden Hitch bicycle rack.  It was a quick and easy installation.  When I sold the 2006 Prius the purchaser made a point of wanting the hitch as part of the deal.<br /><br />I purchased a 2009 Prius new but held off buying another hitch until last week.  I found out the Coastal hitch is no longer available so I researched the Curt version.  I read the Amazon reviews from 2010 and 2011 and thought \\"surely Curt has remedied the problem with the bolt holes not lining up...\\" - So I ordered the Curt hitch.  It arrived quickly and I was impressed with the shiny black paint/powdercoat finish.  I set aside an hour on Saturday afternoon to install it.<br /><br />Well, after removing the cover and propping the hitch into place, I found the spread on the mounting brackets to be about 1/2-3/4 inch too short.  I could tell from the heft of the hitch that this was not an easy thing to bend/spread to line up the mounting holes.  Almost three hours later, and several failed mounting efforts, I was able to complete the installation.  What is sad is I had to use my bench vise to bend the mounting plates and the repeated action (even using a cloth cover) resulted in multiple scratches and gouges that I am sure will rust over time.  When I finally was able to mount all four bolts I lowered my arms and just lay on the ground for about five minutes.  I physically felt sick to my stomach after the repeated installation attempts.<br /><br />I trust that Toyota builds each Prius with the frame mounting holes in the same position.  Why can't Curt craft some type of mounting hole jig to fix their problem?  Also, it would have been extremely helpful to include a paper template to show how much of the plastic cover must be removed for the cover re-installation.  Not wanting to butcher the cover I wound up with 4-5 test fits before I had removed enough plastic - a marked template would have saved another 30 minutes of installation time.<br /><br />Because so many previous reviews mention the bolt hole spacing problem I assume that Curt has not and will not do anything to improve the quality control of their bolt hole spacing process - I'll close with applauding other reviewers that took their hitches to U-Haul or another vendor and paying $35-40 for the installation.  My Saturday evening time is at least worth that much.<br /><br />This hitch is one of few options Prius owners have for light towing and bicycle rack mounting.  I suggest potential purchasers of the Curt hitch plan on spending $35-45 additional installation dollars and have a better experience than I did.
B002DYH586|5|We purchased this product to experiment on a Late Model Stockcar application.  We were constantly checking tire pressure and temps both before racing and after he came off the track to check handling and setup.  This stopped having to get down and check tire pressure and probing tires for temps. When he comes off the track we look at the display and immediately can tell if the car is tight or loose by the readout. The temp display is priceless.  I will put this product on our other race cars as well.  Race Tech does not have a problem with it since you cannot adjust the pressure or temps with it.
B000IOJO5K|2|The first ecm I received was a total dud. Emailed product support and they said &#34;it is highly unlikely that it is the unit. There must be something wrong with your bike.&#34; I knew nothing was wrong with my bike. So I returned it and bought another one for one last try. Success. They say they do live tests with each unit on two bikes. I find that very hard to believe.<br />Anyway, great product though. Bike runs better than ever. The only good thing about zippers customer support is they get back to your email quickly, only to tell you nothing is wrong with their product.
B00KTHXYO8|5|As advertised. Works great
B007XO8Z4E|5|now i see what Robert De Niro sees. these glasses have a light pink rose tint. crystal clear contrast enhanced. the frames are very comfortable. does help block sun rays on sides. worth the money.
B00CJH9S7S|5|Work like they should
B001JT1CEE|5|I used this to run power to some LED light strips in my car. Not much more to say other than it works perfectly fine. It looks to be 100% pure copper which is nice.
B00065L2D8|5|THIS ADAPTER LETS YOU CHANGE FROM BATTERY CLIPS TO  CAR LIGHTER PLUG TO GIVE YOU A CHOICE  FOR POWER TO AIR UP TIRES OR TO RUN 12 VOLT LIGHTS.
B00ARBS98C|1|I do not recommend the supplier, the product is the right but not the amount indicated in the product description on the day you make the purchase from Venezuela, since at the time you make the purchase the description indicated it was a couple of bulbs, but at receive the product was a single light bulb.<br />Additionally, the supplier sent the order divided into three parts which gave me a freight cost more
B000CGFNW2|4|Seems to do the trick.
B0095TC6I6|4|I like these mirrors.  They are easy to install.  There is a bit of vibration on my Ram 1500 mirrors but it isn't bad.  They hold well.
B000J41SVM|5|Great fit and easy to install and remove
B000C14HF6|4|I had to replace the catalytic converter on a '97 Civic because I was getting a Cat error code, and the car is coming due for inspection.  The original was one piece with the exhaust manifold, but this replacement comes in two pieces:  manifold and converter.  The problem is I did not receive gaskets for these two joints.  There should be a large one between the cat and the manifold, and another between the cat and the exhaust pipe.  I improvised with copper spray \\"recommended for exhaust manifolds\\" and some high temp silicone gasket material.  I'll see how long it holds up.    The car was already apart when I realized that I didn't have those gaskets, and my son has to use it for work in a couple of days, so ordering gaskets was not an option.    It doesn't matter how good the part is if I can't install it.      On the plus side, I did receive about a dozen bolts and miscellaneous pieces that are not necessary.
B00C6J5N78|5|Exact match to the orginal, I mounted it on the passenger side.
B0006MRRU8|5|Once I was able to get the old one out I greased the gasket and pull rod and it went in perfect and works great. I believe these should be changed out every 5 years or so in my experience
B0031HFZSQ|5|Recognize good advice when you see it.
B004DKDLP4|1|Over priced product  You can get the same functionality from all XXXX brand  Since all OBD2 scan tool run on ELM327 interface  I don't see the reason why to pay 4 times the amount of money to this product
B00DX889JU|5|I have had the opportunity to use this vest about four times since receiving it a few weeks ago, and each time I have found myself wondering why I did not order this vest sooner.....it is awesome!!!!  I use it for keeping warm while ATV riding.  My ride is a 2005 Honda Rancher 350 TM.  It's stator/alternator puts out only 235 watts at max, but I have not had any problems with low battery voltage whatsoever, even with slow speed, stop and go trail riding.  The vest draws 53 watts on it's highest setting, and at this setting I have stayed toasty warm with a light tee shirt underneath the vest, light fleece jacket over the vest, and then a light uninsulated coat/wind layer to top it off.  Rides have been in the mid 20s to 30's starting off, and I either had to lower the controller's heat output or take off the fleece later in the day as it warmed.  The vest is extremely comfortable to wear, and the 2XL fit me perfectly (6 feet and 250 lbs and yes I do need to lose some of my belly...lol). I also purchased an SAE to coax adapter to allow me to plug the vest into the existing single lead from the battery (Battery Tender Jr. SAE).  I have the battery lead coming out from underneath the seat on my right, the vest's line's emerge from the left, and this power cord layout works well for me.  I am planning a ride for tomorrow afternoon and am looking forward to feeling the nice warmth again.  Five stars on this vest all the way!!!  Looks to be well stitched and has the look and feel of something that will last quite a while.  No hesitation in recommending this for purchase. Also plan on running a battery lead to my fishing boat and using the vest on the water....I am gonna get an early start on the crappie this year!  (Note: I had considered the heated gloves as well, but passed on them as I think I would have problems riding through the occassional brush.)
B006662U1E|5|It was easy to install and works just like the original.  I was leary at first buying a non-factory part, but it worked out fine.
B00796UQHA|5|After deliberating whether to buy this antenna or a 13&#34; antenna, I chose this one.  It is more expensive than the other, but came with favorable reviews.  My son bought one for his truck and it dampened his FM signal so I was hesitant.  I installed this one on my 2015 Xterra and noted no change in the FM volume.  The lack of antenna is pleasing to the eyes as I drive - definitely woth the price.
B00188EHSY|5|I use this filter on a John Deere LX 277 Tractor. It has a 17 HP FH500V Kawasaki engine, I also use this filter on a Kubota RTV 400CI. I use Bosch oil filters on my cars and trucks also.
B002INTCHY|5|The Water Sprite is a great chamois. I have used the Water Sprite for many years, and it works so much better than other synthetic chamois.<br />You will be happy with your purchase.
B001F5GQBQ|5|Gift for a friend
B009I6YN32|5|Item came fairly quickly considering where it was being shipped. Item arrived with cosmetic damage on the box but content inside was well protected with some sort of paper bubble wrap. Installation was a breeze and had this mounted within 1.5hrs. Took my time and did it myself with some basic tools. This was a complete bolt on exhaust system. No drilling or welding or anything like that. I installed it without putting the truck on jacks. I have a Rock Warrior so height clearance may vary on other vehicles. I would suggest getting some new gaskets for where the cat and the new exhaust pipping meet. They give you 2 new gaskets for the tail end of the pipe in the kit. My old gasket was pretty much deteriorated. Noise was definitely notice upon start up. More of a growling noise and once the engine was idling the rumble went away. (That's pretty quiet) On the highway you can notice a rumble when accelerating and a slight rumble when cruising speed. The wife doesn't mind the noise and if shes happy I'm happy. Haven't been on long trips yet so I can't really say much about the noise. As for HP gain, I don't know. My butt dyno doesn't feel a difference. But it sounds fast.... Hope this review helps.
B000HTS5JC|3|looks good, makes a rattling sound when driving, loosens up frequently, cheesy install kit. if it had just screwed on, it would have been awesome.<br /> Also, about three days after receiving it, one of the caps fell off.
B001L2DC74|4|I like it. Should be on my truck, for the rest of its life. I only gave 4 stars because I thought. The fit between this pipe and the magnaflow 13216 muffler should have been tighter. Over all no real issue.
B003V9TCW4|5|great, solid tool.
B0012RLZM2|5|Always listed for Camry, but is what the Prius needs... with a mild repinning. There will never be a listing for the Prius due the Prius having an official zero towing capacity.
B000BQQMPK|3|For the money these mats should be five stars, but alas, are not. They slide easily and are definitely not an exact fit. Another downfall is that when you turn the heat on for any floor setting, they release an obnoxious smell.
B005BNZ9UM|5|Use them to stabilize my 5th wheel and they work fine. I like that they stack and belt together when storing. It's less likely that they will blow out of the back of the truck while traveling when belted together.
B00026HYJW|5|Great produce for small repairs.
B0002Q7ZU0|5|Very f as t
B00F5MUB66|5|Perhaps not needed for a full-size shower in a Class A, B or  5th wheeler (not familiar with those shower/bath plumbing set-ups), this is one of those extras listed as a &#34;must have&#34; by other reviewers that I fully agree is a must have for  a travel trailer.  It has &#34;home shower power&#34; and doesn't blow through your fresh water supply.  Wonderful product- period.
B002QGVWBW|3|product arrived faster than estimated  charged it to full charge and then after sitting in my room without being used it lost 2 volts in three days.  i am recharging it now if it still wont hold charge i am going to return it
B00FFIIHHU|5|Easy to apply, Looks like a professional job.
B005C1XHFC|4|I bought these for my 2008 civic thinking it would be the complete package But it wasn't. The packaging was extremely small and the instructions provided would make no difference if there were none at all but I work at a body shop so I knew how to do it, might be confusing for some people. I was a little confused when I got the package because I thought it would include the lights for the exterior trunk also but apparently that's a different option. Is it worth it? in my opinion I think if you have amazon prime you could probably get a lot more for cheaper, but you would have to buy the three different types of bulbs.
B00KVU6YRW|5|I have a Volvo S-80, and the factory equips you with non replaceable 194 bulbs soldered into the bulb holders. Here is the fix. And, inexpensive! Buy these for your Volvo, or other cars using the twist lock bulb holders, and BAM, problem solved. Wonder item. I now have bright LED lights in the entire interior of my Volvo. Thanks Partsam!  Great outfit.
B008FCFC94|5|These splash guards are very good quality, were easy to install, and are a PERFECT color match for my 2010 Buick Enclave.  I am VERY happy with this item!!!
B00009PGNS|5|Very handy!
B006G14FK8|5|Great value
B000EQAVHM|5|Fits perfect for my 2004 F350 6.0 diesel 4X4 pickup.
B000C55VB6|5|1989 Ford Econoline E-150 Van V8 5.0 - Front Springs.  Got these springs for this van.  Installed at same time as Monroe 34911 Gas-Magnum Shock Absorber.  They work well together.  Old shocks and springs were bottoming out and not great.  Together these work amazing.  I did recently do the rear shocks as well, but not the leafs.  Right now the van is sitting a little higher in the front because of this but it's not very noticeable.  All around these are working out great.
B007VRF03W|5|Used to seal a vacuum line worked perfect and lots of sizes to choose from.
B000FW61EW|5|Could not have done the back window repair in our beetle without it. Saved some big bucks!
B000CO8RTU|5|This Hitch mounted perfectly to my Lexus RX330 and RX350 vehicles with factory installed tow receiver hitch assemblies.  Both vehicles needed a rise of about 4.5 inches to work with my Yakima Rock and Roll kayak trailer.  So I just flipped the hitch over and installed it in about a minute.  Purchased a hitch pin at Home Depot for $6.00 to keep it connected to the vehicle receiver hitch assembly. I'm using a 1 and 7/8 inch diameter ball with a 2 inch diameter hole mount.  Works great.  Excellent medium duty hitch for my needs.
B000C546HQ|5|Easy install and great design with grease fitting much better over stock sealed design. Moog makes great  products and very recommended for any vehicle
B00DPIFDOW|1|Only enough for one side of vehicle ,so it would cost double the asking price
B001S874F2|2|I works okay for the outside of the vehicle but inside you will have to rewash your windows with water to get rid of the streaks... Typical Rain-X product that leaves a residue even after 2 & 3 dry wipes.  The only good thing about this is the foam that doesn't run down everywhere.  I think they should redesign the product to be really streak-free and really repel water.
B002R20NIS|5|Perfect for my Forf Edge! Very simple and solved all problems!!<br />I recommend this product for anyone because it helpfull.
B000G72W1C|3|USED THESE FOR YEARS.IF THEY ARE OUTSIDE,THEY BECOME BRITTLE AND CHEAP DRAINCOCK BREAKS OFF.REPLACE EVERY YEAR.BUT FIXED WITH NEW ONES.WHEN NEW REMOVE THE DRAIN AND REPLACE WITH A DOOD RADIATOR DRAIN.ALSO IF YOU NEED WRENCH OR PLIERS TO REMOVE,YOU HAVE IT TOO TIGHT.BARELY HAND TIGHT AND YOU WONT BREAK/CRACK REMOVING.ALSO COLOR TURND DARK AFTER A WHILE.BUT I STILL USE BECAUSE OF VISABLE VIEW OF FUEL.
B002R773I6|4|it fits very well on my 2008 C350. It is made in Turkey, unlike what it shows in the picture &#34;made in Germany&#34;
B00070JJZU|5|It was a great product and did what it was supposed to do
B003O9XX7G|5|Love this. It looks so cute on my new car!(: two of them were shipped on accident so I used both. Everyone loves it.
B0060KLZAS|5|Perfect!
B004W7KS18|5|Super easy to install. Great product
B00652G4TS|5|Very cool gadget!  Took me about 2 minutes to figure out.  Cleared the check engine light on my Dodge Ram 3500 and gave me several possible causes for it.  Already paid for itself!!
B000NCMS7I|1|this seller does not stand behind what it sells - purchased a charger that did not work and would not allow return - amazon unable to help
B007XZK7U8|2|The item is already unsticking...I guess I should have went with a different brand. The stuff isn't bonding at all, my husband stay pushing it together.
B005ERW8YK|1|Bought it because it was cheap but it doesn't work. I will buy one of the others and maybe send it back but don't know why because I don't want another one!<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ERW8YK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
B00DCR7TSE|5|This is a sharp-looking little antenna that comes with several mounting screws to fit most applications.  It fit my 2013 Cooper Hatchback perfectly.  I was concerned with getting worse reception with a smaller antenna until I learned that this antenna only draws a signal for the AM radio, not the FM or Satellite.  But I've found that AM comes in just fine.  It's well made and very nice looking in person.
B0006302MM|4|Works as intended. I've used ArmorAll for 40 years and never really cared for the glossy look, even though it always performed its duty of protecting rubber and vinyl and leather. I much prefer the non-glossy finish.
B00099HVN6|5|I ordered an Optima red top 6 volt battery on March 10,2010.  THe battery failed because I left it with a load on it for several months and it killed the battery, my fault.  I called Optima and went through their recommended charging procedures but no dice.  They told me to contact Amazon because they handled warranties directly.  Amazon returned the entire purchase price.  You need to have the order #, date of purchase and explain exactly what you did to determine the cause of the failure.  Is this some great service?  Boy, I really am a happy customer
B00KNNPPZO|4|Color was slightly off, but easy to install,  seems to be high quality
B000C59M7A|5|MY BUICK WAGON RIDES AS IF IT WERE NEW.THE SHOCKS HAVE MADE A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN IT HANDLING AND LOAD CAPACITY
B000PJED72|5|sprays on well the nozzle hasn't clogged through several uses. initial application can drip if it is too heavy. instructions say to apply than wipe with a dry cloth, which is not always needed. In a minute or so, it is dry to the touch and very slippery.
B0074MS2RU|5|Amazing...on occasion accidents happen. You may mare a part adding or removing, there are countless ways you can scratch or mare your black rifles. I had a few wear marks on my AR this stuff completely covered it marching the finish perfectly. I got a EOTech XPS2-0 in a trade that had a small but noticeable scratch on it...aluminum black completely removed it. This is my go to on all super black touch ups. Will be buying again...shipper did great as well.
B00DUQKGIM|4|Great tool.
B000BUQOGI|5|Was exactly what we needed for 30 to 50 amp.  Nice quality, why pay more somewhere else?  This is all you need.
B0023VKJBO|3|Signal light part of unit is a clear while original is yellow.  This is the color when not signaling.<br />Hiring signaling it is a closer match.
B006E4SQNY|5|I recently bought this item in taupe for my 2007 hyundai santa fe.  It fits perfectly.  Also the color is an excellent  match for interior of my car.  Like that i can open and close console without removing cover.  Have two dogs and thought this might get dirty, and stained real quick -  but has not.  And when it does become soiled, was told it is washable.  So pleased with this item, have just placed order to get a second one.  Nice snug, tight fit also.....Highly recommend.  As info, i bought this item as my armrest is leather, and one dog kept standing on armrest, which started to scratch/ruin the leather.  This solved the problem.
B0002NYDZ8|2|Yes, I read all the 140+ reviews before made the purchase because I don't want to end up in a messy situation if the grease gun fail. Some comments said it only gives about 1/3 of the handle traveling to pump out the grease and some said it never worked. Both happened in my case, the grease gun only worked &#34;once&#34; with 1/3 of the pump. This is really frustrating, because after putting the effort of removing the mower deck, I am not able to grease it. It is sitting idle and waiting for Amazon's replacement. (Amazon is pretty good reacting to my replacement request, plus the grease.) I would say the construction material is sound (pluses), but the reliability is questionable (TBD). I am willing to give it one more chance.
B0050DD9KK|4|Very nice product, hard to find product
B00HKM05JC|5|good
B000C5WFCO|5|Perfect factory fit!!
B004A32ERA|4|Just purchased a used pop-up with this furnace.  Previous owner had never used the furnace in ten years.  Added an LP tank and it started flawlessly.  Lots of heat for its size.
B000Q754E4|5|This cooler works.... too well! Has to be unplugged periodically to keep my food from freezing. Still a remarkable improvement on the 6 other coolers I had in my truck that didn't keep food cold enough. If your food goes bad because of insufficient cooling, you might want to give this a try.
B002IABWPW|5|great product for road kit. very sturdy and easy to use. a must have for anyone who has had the scary \\" engine light\\" come on. lets you know right away if it's serious or not. i purchased for some peace of mind before going on a long road trip. love it
B0036GK6T0|5|Make sure to pick up one of these low cost cases for your battery tender.  This will keep your battery tender safe and secure for just a couple of bucks.
B00D5CGF36|5|Worked perfect!
B004OJZIB4|5|Nice heavy duty liscense plate holder. Looks to be made in very solid material. Price is for only one holder so decide for your self if the price is reasonable. I ordered one for the rear of my 4Runner and use a cheaper one from auto store for the front. It is a nice looking holder.<br /><br />Rear plate seems to get more road grime and corrodes faster. So I bought this holder. So far it is holding up well and showing no signs of degrading.<br /><br />Screw cover caps fit good and clip on very well.
B00200EFJA|4|This stuff foams nicely and stays in place - which is perfect for interior door hinge lubrication.i don't worry about it dripping onto the carpet. The nozzle is tightly fit into the top, as expected.<br /><br />Only con is the smell - it has the strong initial odor of bug spray. Goes away quickly, but is strong initially.
B007JYYPO2|5|This is the first creeper that I have ever owned that actually felt solid. I weigh 320+ pounds and this well worth the money.<br />I crushed 2 other cheep creepers over the years. This one should last a life time.
B00LHUI4XM|5|I received the plate frame in a few days from ordering  packed well and in excellent condition . I didn't put it on yet because it's freezing outside . I'm in no hurry because the Honda  Accord it is going on is being put away for the winter . But all the hardware is there and I watched the insallation video on how the screw covers work and I imagine it to be a five to ten minute job . Oh and the license plate frame looks great  .
B008BMQSG4|5|Excellent product, no complaints whatsoever. Complimented on the look these boards have given my Road King. More room to move my feet which adds to the comfort of my ride.
B001BCEER6|2|Disappointed. Did not meet my expectation. Poor rear view after adjusting. Can see less than 20% behind me. May have to go to the dealer and purchase one that can give me full rear view.
B0053ZJADK|5|Go Falcons. I've had this decal on my car now for 6 months. It has withstood the Texas sun and many car washes. Still looks great! Go Falcons!
B00171Q3HU|5|Ok, So I saw these and they were cheap, so I though what the heck its worth a shot. My front kinda worked before and my back did not work at all. I really didn't think these would work. Mechanic said I had to replace everything cause the tank wouldn't even hold water. I got both pumps and they fixed everything. One of my old pumps had been broken in half and the rubber seal was bad, that is why all my water leaked out. My back and front both work like they are new. Even sound so quiet like they are new. If you are getting both replacements the plugs are different so you cant mess it up and they do come with rubber seals.
B000C3ZCOE|5|I have an older 1995 Honda Civic 4Dr EX, if that helps.  I'm sure these fit other cars, but obviously you'll have to figure that out. My car is not lowered. Its at it's stock height more or less.  I just reused the old springs from my old shocks using a spring compressor and put them on these.  My car feels just like it used to.  Well at least the rear of my car does.<br /><br />FYI: I got these in 2011 and 80k+ miles later they are still holding up. No leaks or anything.  I've read that these are not good for lowered vehicles so keep that in mind.  If I ever decide to lower my car I'll look into something more suitable for that.  Until then, I'm enjoying them at my stock height.
B001447VB2|5|I use this product every day. Its a must have in life. works on metal, glass, and plastic. I love it.best polish you can buy. 6 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0009N4F8Q|5|love them thank you
B004UQV3II|4|Purchased this to vent my small greenhouse.  It works quite well with a decent amount of sun.  It doesn't move a whole lot of air, it's not like a industrial greenhouse fan, but it helps with ventilation.  It did make quite a bit of noise when I first installed it, but when the blade assembly was tapped lightly, somehow that fixed the rattle and it has been whisper quiet ever since.  Not sure what happened, but a little pressure applied to the blade unit might balance it better and make it quieter.
B000VT59LU|5|This product is a little time consuming to put on because you have to remove the grille, but not difficult to install. It looks great and there is no tape stuck to he hood of my truck as there would have been with other products.
B001KSAB6Y|1|Aboslutely does NOT fit a 2004 Honda Civic Si, no matter what their system says.
B00266BSRK|5|Nice, good quality item. Worth that money.
B004X375KI|4|Looks good
B004RCQVAK|5|Perfect price. Perfect replacement
B004M3UMFY|2|Broke right away
B00NP61VDQ|5|These ice scrapers work extremely well. Easy to use and removes ice with ease.
B000OAXOFE|5|Exact fit for my 07 5.9 Cummins. The length and the offset the pipe was bent at was just right.
B008N6871M|3|Just ok
B000FQ7HXW|5|Works good
B00K7935KQ|2|Bought these to replace the stock license plate frame the dealers put on my 2012 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited sahara, however, upon receiving it, it didn't fit so I asked for a full refund and returned it back to Amazon.<br /><br />Arrived in time, returning and getting a full refund was no problem.<br />the material seems weak and brittle, a little too cheap but you get what you pay for in this world, right? =)<br /><br />overall, it might be good for other vehicles, it didn't fit my JKU, so for other JEEP JKU owners; be advised, it doesn't fit our rear license plate bracket. Didn't even bother with the front.
B000WENDUS|1|This bike cover will not fit two mountain or hybrid bikes.  It should be noted that the bikes need to be road bikes with short handlebars.  A waste of money if you need it to fit two bikes with regular wide style handlebars.
B000CN8UEI|5|I have a 327 in a hot rod and the 4 blade fan just did not do the trick and it would overheat after about 2 stoplights.<br />After installing this fan and building a small shroud around it I can idle in 90 degree weather.
B002K6K3RM|3|After about 3 months the bulbs started to flicker and go out as I would have to turn the headlights off then back to get them back on. It's apparent that the quality of these bulbs are not great. They shine very brightly but they don't last.
B00VNQLDQK|3|1999 GMC Suburban SLT - used the &#34;hot system&#34; lamps to replace reverse light lamps. Overall, nice product, fit right in with no socket or wire adjustments, but not as bright as I had anticipated vs. existing standard lamp. This may not be the fault of the product, and could be the way the lamp sits in the socket in my vehicle model. I would not recommend to those with a similar vehicle.
B000VAUGD0|5|Quality, and very well built
B000O3U2UQ|4|Well built and easy to use on all types of batterys.
B0016KH254|3|there was only an install plate that was a basic right ange plate that allowed you to mount the 7 and 4-way to but very few options as to where to mount to the truck. Also mine did not even come with screws to mount or secure the 7 & 4way to the plate. otherwise a solid built product and works as designed.
B001BRYTYY|5|This is my 2nd K&N product! I got Nissan Rogue SV. Great value and so far the fuel economy was improve by 1 mile for my 1st gas pump and I will expect more and more for my next pump.
B000VEHNR8|5|These are very nice and look good! I had a set before and they finally quit working so I got another pair.
B0096J90KW|5|Replacing the standard light bulbs with the 68 SMD LED lights from EZ Motoring is working out great. I have done this  in 8 main locations  in our cougar trailer.  Over the bed area I went to a  36 SMD as I did not want the brightness that the 69 SMD puts out.
B00B2AFKKM|5|What I wanted and what I needed
B00K806G0A|1|Not for me!
B00937LIFM|3|Pros: Good power boost with appropriate Hondata FlashPro tuning solution, sounds good with factory exhaust. (Very little difference in volume, tone) Good value in terms of horsepower per dollar.<br /><br />Cons: Not great fitment. O2 sensor wires don't reach the factory harness because of the relocation this header implements. You have to splice your O2 wires. Doesn't mate up to factory exhaust squarely so it leaks, doesn't put weight on its rear exhaust hanger which could hurt the cylinder head. No installation instructions at all. Installing a header on a Civic Si is difficult.
B001P29P2Q|5|A must have to keep in your trunk for those road side emergencies
B000Q08SLC|5|Replaced original belt on 04 Honda Element which was still serviceable after 159k miles but was showing wear.  Perfect OEM replacement that fit perfectly.
B00LX28WAO|4|Just installed the lights so I can’t say anything about their longevity.  There 14.85 Watts as measured on a 13.5 VDC system, not 18 Watt.  Total current draw is about 1.1 Amps apiece so their good on off-road or agricultural equipment that don’t have large alternators.<br /><br />Nice even bright light, mostly white with a slight bluish tint but it’s hard to tell.  Seem to have a wider dispersal pattern than 60° which is fine for use on the tractor.  They’re mounted about 6 feet off the ground and 4 feet in front of them is lit really well.  I’ve got them both angled out about 15° and they probably light up over 140° of my field of view teen feet ahead of the tractor.<br /><br />Total light throw is maybe 100 feet but it starts falling off rapidly after 30-40 feet or so.  If you’re mounting these on a vehicle I think the spot beam would be better.  Their almost too bright to use when your close to something.<br /><br />I got these for working after dark and I think they’ll do nicely.
B002M1WZO4|3|Good replacement plugs. Went in just like any other plug. Not impressed by them. Don't seem to be meeting the Hype by the manufacturer. Would not buy again nor recommend to anyone.
B001Q8DMA0|5|Great towel!it will hold a lot more water before u need to wring it out,I'm skeptical about cutting it up into smaller sections fearing it might leave lint from the frayed edges.i highly recommend
B00BG3Z9AG|5|Love Mine.  Looks great and def performs.
B00MWK0LRI|1|I love giraffes.. For my birthday I got a zoo trip to feed the giraffes. I also bought this for myself. I was SO excited. It is super cute, however, I am a grammar fanatic, and this makes me crazy! Instead of &#34;I &#60;3 Giraffes&#34; it says &#34;I &#60;3 Giraffe&#34;. Singular. It is highly annoying and it makes me mad every time I see it. The picture posted here shows the &#34;S&#34; but the actual frame does NOT have the S -- if you don't want to look like a fool, don't get this. Find another frame.
B002YKRXY0|5|great
B00XQP995S|5|Very good parts i can rebuilt my turbo.
B00498YFUK|5|Good fit for the upper control arms in my 2008 Canyon 2WD.<br />Good quality product.
B000S2U49W|5|Needed to replace the damaged ant. on my Enclave. Wanted to have OEM part. This fit the bill and was half the price the local dealer wanted.
B005MZYKSQ|5|Love this butterfly.  Looks really cute on my Demin Blue VW Beetle.
B001C6Q8CK|5|Changed out the Thermostat to a 180 from a 195 on my Jeep..Thank god i got this cause i tried to seal it up with the old one but had a small drip..For the money its a great housing..By the way the strait 6 is a tough one to seal..do not overtighten...
B0009J7EEM|3|Works ok and idea is great but net material is too flimsy
B00RAQQ7SG|5|No complaints.  They do their job and look great doing it.
B0013LH8PK|5|Delivered on time and works exactly as intended. Buy the leads that permanently attach to your battery- so you can just plug it in- then check your battery and charging system with it as soon as the motor is running.
B00KXUFPZM|3|Not very bright and had to modify both mechanical and electricals to install.
B001DCF0XQ|1|Said it would fit a 2005 mazda 3... It doesn't.
B0012TTEZA|5|They are fairly thick rubber and do a great job of clinging to the bleeder nipples but are still easy to pull off with gloved fingers.
B00B2ABDJY|5|This kit is the perfect lift/level for the price. Rough country is a very reliable brand and the intructions were step by step and incredibly helpful.
B000C53T3S|5|My front right strut were leaking and my mechanic recommended to purchase Monroe Sensa-Trac Struts. I personally never used this brand before or ever heard of it.I just wanted struts that will be like when I first had my car to ride smoothly. After the installation the struts  worked perfectly taking the impact of pot holes and it didn't bounce as much as before. I am very pleased with my purchase as always Amazon always delivers on time. Buy with confidence!
B001GRME8C|4|I guess I didn't read this close enough to realize it's for behind the third row. I went by the picture showing it's the full storage area. I ended up ordering another mat to go over the third row seats when they're folded down. It's a good mat though.
B0087XOTWW|5|Ok, I ordered these as an upgrade to LED’s from the old lights in our 2010 Keystone bullet.<br />First, these lights were brighter, with a blueish hue, then the lights that I replaced.<br />The wattage it uses is spot on in that I couldn’t be happier to include the price versus over our local Camping Supply Store’s prices. These were phenomenal. The packaging was appropriate size. Item was received on time and exceeded my expectations.<br />Now the real test came from the total output draw of the lights versus the old lights created a dilemma, we get to dry camp without RV longer without using generator to recharge our batteries...if that’s a dilemma I welcome it.<br />I cannot believe the quality, the price without the heat and excess electricity use.
B000YA1ZP0|5|OUTSTANDING PRODUCT.
B00AFBXQNC|5|Great car soap, chemical guys products never disappoint. This soap seems to produce more suds and bubbles compared to other soaps, smells great too
B007Q1FGLY|5|Awesome
B0019WYE6O|1|I ordered this product which was matched to my Toyota tundra ltd. But when it arrived it didn't fit.<br />I just couldn't be bothered to return it. Needless to say I will not be shopping with them anymore.<br />It may have been a genuine mistake.
B004D2XYHM|5|After ordering an inferior product/brand, I was pleased with performance of these bulbs. I installed them in the corners of my 14 Tacoma and they look great and are brighter than the OEM incandescent bulbs. Putco is now my go to for replacement LEDs as I have used several of their other products for other areas of my vehicle and they offer consistent quality and performance.
B006WPQNB2|5|Great item just got it and it works great for me its like a regular toilet great buy for the price!!
B000C7TXPE|1|Had to return this one was found broken in the box and the box is to light and flimsy to ship this even the replacement one had a big hole in box could have damaged it. Also the upper connect is a smaller diameter than the factory one you have to push the hose all the way to the tank and it really not a good fit.
B00A9MO2XK|5|A bit tedious to install but it has been working great for months now.
B000ALEM6W|3|the bulb works fine its a 12 volt bulb it does suck the power down quite quickly I have found other bulbs much more efficient.
B00067BVN2|3|THESE LIGHT BULBS ARE OKAY THEY ARE BRIGHTER THAN STOCK BUT I WISH THAT THEY WOULD LAST LONGER, MINE BURNT OUT AFTER ONLY 3 MONTHS OF USE. I HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE SILVERSTARS BEFORE, THEY WERE BRIGHTER BUT LIFE SPAN WAS VERY SHORT. IN MY POINION IT SEEMS THAT ALL THESE BRIGHTER LIGHT BULBS HAVE VERY SHORT LIFE SPAN FOR SOME REASON. IF YOU LIKE CHANGING YOUR LIGHT BULBS OFTEN THAN I SAY BUY THEM, BUT IF NOT THAN I SAY GO WITH A GOOD QUALITY XENON'S INSTEAD.
B003X6EGGW|5|Great product! Only took my brother and I 3hrs to install with no lift. Improved mpg, smoother shift, and throttle responcse. I would  def. recommend these headers .
B00FJ75TFU|5|I highly recommend this chrome switch set.  I installed them along with the chrome controls and everything fit perfectly (2000 FLSTF)  Wiring comes with pins crimped on the ends already, same color-codes as Harley has already so with the help of a long pointed tool (I used the straight end of an O-ring tool) one can release the stock pins from the wiring harness with ease and position the new wiring pins therein.  For a side project, get some chrome or stainless steel wiring wrapping to skate these wiring sets through before installing the harness connector.  Looks a lot better than the stock black plastic wire sheathing.
B0052SF0LO|5|Great
B000HRF2SQ|5|Perfect fit.  Easy install.
B00G3DBJGC|5|perfect
B000221M94|4|Might need to get a couple of these to double the length to account for the area where you might have parked your car.  Also, the mount holes in the top corners are thin and could be easily be pulled of the wall with screws staying in the wall.  Bumpers are hollow with a web structure, works well for absorbing impact from doors.
B004VLA0TA|4|it works. one star minus for not being exactly the same size on the ml430. counting turns will get you close to wheel alignment spec actually toe was  way off..
B00F9G8TP8|5|Just after a few 100 miles on my new Panigale I notice slight damage to the radiator from rocks kicked up from the front tire.  With it's not so protected location behind the front wheel a radiator guard is almost required to avoid catastrophy. Installation was really easy using existing screws. Drop on and go!
B00686TX9O|1|Very thin plastic and very cheaply made. I guess you definitly get what you pay for. Would not recommend if your looking for a good replacement part.
B00685HYEG|5|Looks great, the engraved gears are really precise and the red is a good nice shade. Glad i got it and it came in within just a few days!
B00P2PJI7Y|1|did not fit
B001341K92|5|Fast shipping great product
B001EAQTRI|5|Works perfectly.
B0050VFA8G|1|Didn't work out of the box.  Very disappointed.
B000C543BU|5|Sturdier than stock.  I can tell a difference after I got it on and got a front end alignment, truck felt a whole lot better.
B000PL0E0U|5|I replaced my older spark plugs with Bosh Super Plus about a year ago.<br />Not only I had more power but the gas mileage is better. Still is and I hope<br />these sparks to last me for a long time. .
B00029J40G|5|This cooler does the job. It is now attatched to my 2003 Dodge Durango the pulls a two ton trailer at least once a month. The cooler works well with a notable difference in the temperature from inut to output. I am confident that it's extending the life of my near 11 year old 170K+ mile transmission!
B0019IP8PO|5|Quiet pads. Good
B0073J97NC|4|Fits 1980 Honda CB750C with slight modification of factory plug (remove tabs that hit the fuse) and swapping the battery / motor terminals (pay attention to &#34;M&#34; and &#34;B&#34; labels).<br />A dozen starts in and so-far so good.
B001LQLRK4|5|Nice.
B004ZF4930|4|Very bright headlights. Easy to install.  Could use more wire.
B00BK85HHM|5|Good and sturdy just wish it wasn't packaged the way it was having trouble getting one corner to lay down
B000EDOT8C|5|I have a galley style kitchen so counter space is very limited. I bought this to supplement the cutting boards I already have. This product far exceeded my expectations! it is large enough that I can use it directly over my sink and I won't have any food falling off. Which was a problem I had with my smaller cutting boards before. It is sturdy and so far the wood has not been cut into when chopping up vegetables and the plastic sleeves that come with the board are perfect for protecting the board when cutting meat! I love it. Also, the cutting board is equipped with sturdy gripping underneath to prevent moving while cutting.
B0087NAWYQ|5|I have a GSXR 1000 with a M4 slip on exhaust that is way WAY loud. After a few reviews I decided to buy the 10 instead of the 5. I chose the 10 because they have bigger speakers and the bluetooth unit detaches for easy charging. I installed it on my helmet today and went for a ride. The music was literally TOO LOUD and I had to turn it down.  I called my wife to check the how well the mic for the phone was. She said it sounded great and couldn't hear any exhaust noise. It only got windy when I was on the freeway going 70 mph. Needless to say, I'm SO glad I purchased the 10 instead of the 5.
B00EKXFPOY|1|They're dim. Not very bright at all. You get what you pay for. I will not be able to use these.
B0097AHE0S|2|It seemed like a decent knob for the price, even after I received it and fitted it on my car. About 2 days after installation, I apparently made too many left turns, because the screw holding the knob to the mount (which is ridiculously small) backed itself out and the knob came off in my hand. I feel like this is something that should not have happened, especially because my old cheap one (that squeaked during use) lasted somewhere around a year. I think a little bit of Loctite would probably not have been a bad preventative measure. The metal mount feels solid, though, and the knob turned smoothly during use.
B00KWMG4A6|5|Everything I was expecting!!
B003PL07QS|5|Easy to install. Only in use for about a month, but working perfectly.<br />I recommend this to anyone in need of replacing their starter.
B00J2CI6OY|4|Thumbs up
B0034HNN2I|5|I am a high mileage driver and I change oil every 8-9 thousand mile so I like to use extended service filters. I don't have any data that &#34;proves&#34; this Bosch filter is any better at filtering than Mobil1, WIX or any other brand. In terms of physical properties it is superior. For one, it weighs nearly twice as much as the stock filter and appears to outweigh the other extended filters also. The metal body is substantial and from what you can see looking into the openings appears to be higher quality materials than most filters. It also has what appears to be a synthetic type gasket seal as well, which I like. I've used them for over a year now, the only minor complaint is that it wouldn't fit any filter sockets I had. Took me forever to find the right socket to fit it.
B0076D5OI2|5|Perfect fit. Had to do no mods.  ( plug and play )
B003BG4PUQ|5|I just wanted a keychain
B0068ODC1Q|5|I have had no problems with this so far and it looks just like the original.
B000E9Z49Y|4|Bought this for our son in law... he loves it.
B000COUMY8|5|works great!
B00D1CQVIY|5|Exactly what I needed thanks!
B00HAPI8JS|2|I purchased these looking for an alternative to the $40+ tie rods from Moog and others. This model must be manufactured for the Euro SX-4 because the threads are not correct at the steering rack. I had to borrow a car to run all over town to buy two correct tie rods after discovering these would not fit.
B000GGTQVW|5|This product must be used carefully.  As with any painting job, preperation is key.  the mfg recommends their two step process of using Marine Clean and then Prep & Ready to degrease and clean the surface to accept POR-15.  ONLY buy as much POR-15 as you need.  It reacts with moisture and will go bad if you leave the lid off for prolonged periods.  Also, do not get any POR-15 on the lid or rim or it will be welded shut the next time you try to use it.  If doing a small job, transfer the POR into another container using a small scoop if you have one.  With POR-15, you do not have sand the rust off or grind down the material to base metal.  Just make sure you degrease and clean the surface, and then apply POR-15.  It is a special paint that will lock out any moisture and prevent further rusting.  I would then recommend you prime and repaint on top, as the POR-15 is not UV stable.<br /><br />I think you are better off buying the small size for most projects.
B0002UEMZ2|5|it keeps screws from loosing. works very well
B0068EROUQ|3|The jacket is wonderful and I will say that you should wear this in the winter as well if you work outdoors like I do. Only draw back is that the pants ripped because it was a bit tight in the crotch region. Well for something cheap as this I will go larger on my next buy!
B001GC2LVM|5|I hope this review helps you in your shopping. I always depend on them when I buy something. These may be the handiest things I have ever bought for our RV. Leveling has always been a problem. Yelling and screaming while the wife directs me. Boards...then more boards...then more boards. By the time we were level in our decrepit old Texas state parks, we weren't speaking for the first day of the trip. But these things are amazing. I get the RV almost to where we want it to be. Then we slide these under the wheels on the low side. My wife stands there with a level on the side of the RV and I back onto these levelers.  She says stop when the bubble is centered and we are done. They may have saved our marriage, and they certainly have made camping more fun.
B0089KNGNQ|5|The key fob arrived quickly.  Upon receiving I programmed it myself using the directions at [...]. (otherwise known as the chicken dance).  The key works perfectly to start the vehicle and lock and unlock the doors without taking it out of my pocket.  We only received on FOB when we bought our 2006 Prius.  It provides a level of comfort having the second FOB.  Awesome.
B001AJKRNA|4|These mirrors fit & look great. Had the kind that strapped on b4. These work & look a lot better.
B0094BHE50|5|I bought a brand new Kayak before taking a two week vacation from New York to Minnesota and back.  These locks and cables were excellent quality and gave me piece of mind each night when I had to leave the Kayak in a hotel parking lot. I have already recommended them to numerous friends.
B0085FP79Q|4|Bought it for my 98gs. The only problem I had was that it didn't bolt directly onto the catalytic converter so I had to have the shop cut and weld it so it fit.
B00LP44FE2|3|The boot fit well on the bottom but is too short to properly cover the full height from the  bottom of the boot to the shifter handle. Recommend this item for a short shift kit.
B008ZT6GRE|5|This is the finest you can buy.  I have had them for years and they are still going strong.  As another reviewer said, why have an expensive car with a $2 plastic frame that allows the plate to get dirty and dinged up.  Buy one you won't be sorry - well worth the money.
B00877SL2M|5|Great happy with this product.
B004YIDI76|5|Love the way it fits.
B0048FYJ2S|4|fitted as expected
B00353PWAW|5|This is an awesome product. Cleans well, And Left Zero Spots
B007O5GYPO|5|What a life saver. Works great and was very easy to install and set up.  Had it one week and was hauling a 6000 lbs trailer threw the mountains and a car accident happened write in front of me. I stopped just as fast as if I had no trailer on.... five stars. ... best buy.
B004QK2APS|5|Works very well, much cheaper than high end version of the same design
B004QMOK7M|2|I expected the fabric to be the same that another Simoniz product sold by Bed and Bath. This one is very thin and I cannot see much use for the product.
B000O80B5M|4|I can't vouch for its temperature accuracy (though it's pretty close to conventional thermometers at room temps), but the laser on my unit wasn't  quite aligned and shot off to one side from center by about 6\\" at ten feet.  Now I know that won't really matter at the distances you're supposed to use this thing, but this lax quality control did bug me.  Also, the free case is nice, but gives off a strong \\"made-in-China\\" smell for a few days.  Otherwise, the fit and finish and materials used are very good.  The unit looks sturdy and built to last.
B000QGOPO0|5|These speakers just popped into the old housings.  If you don't get OEM equipment like this, be prepared to drill some holes and maybe get an aftermarket mounting kit.  This system is fits exactly and I installed them in just about 30 minutes.  Tip:  Watch some youtube videos first. They show you how the door panels come off.  Once you see it first hand, it's a snap.  Without the videos I would have fumbled around and maybe broken some of the attachment parts.  Don't be frustrated, watch the videos first.
B001BYAXMO|2|Even at a large 26\\" length, this blade works well to clear water away, however, many times it would make a loud snapping sound on return wipe making it sound like the windshield would break, works well, but don't be faint of heart (even the radio will not drown out this snapping sound)!  Used on a Pontiac G8
B00LAFAXVK|2|I would have given it a 1 star but giving it two, cause it will look good on your refrigerator :-)<br /><br />I stay in NC, and till now nothing of mine has ever been stolen, not because everyone is a saint in NC but because I may not have given an opportunity to someone.<br /><br />But this product has &#34;Please Steal Me&#34; written all over it. Since it can be easily removable (as its magnetic), I lost it within 1 day of putting it on my car's boot. 1 day tats all it took, it could have been anyone, someone who just got fascinated by the way it looks. Just would have touched it and it would have come in his hand!! Then its too hard to ignore as it was so easy. My mistake that I bought it despite knowing its magnetic. But just warning others there is practically no use of thing which is so insecure.<br /><br />If you don't like to put a Sticker to your bumper buy one of those suction cup types, which can be placed inside the car on the rear glass.
B0060ZB2L0|4|This is my first set of LED lights.  Replaced a set of Hella Optilux HIDs that really disappointed.  Wish I'd spent the $350 to start with as now I'm out $550 with the abandoned Hellas.  Down-the-road illumination is impressive.  Would have given five stars but slightly disappointed in beam spread at about 200 feet where you'd like a little more illumination.  The other mark-down, although I knew it going in, is the stone guards that make it very difficult to clean the (plastic) lenses. I removed them since the lights were mounted above the bumper so rocks aren't much of a concern.  Be careful removing them - crazy tight.  For $350 they should throw in the $10 plastic covers.  PIAA switches are nice hardware.  With lower amperage draw am able to run off any harness.  No regrets with decision.<br /><br />UPDATED: Apparently the first winter wasn't wet enough because the lights leak huge amounts of water - and it sloshes around in the lamp.  Never disassembled.  Shipping back to PIAA with commentary - don't expect a refund but I'll never remount them with this kind of leakage.<br />6Oct2016 - PIAA contacted me from this review and said the lights should not have leaked.  Fortunately I live in the same city as PIAA and went out today to get a brand new set of 570s.  Amazing customer service.  Added stars based on expectation that product was defective and replacement unit will not experience same problem.
B0052XIDFE|5|i bought this to fix my 2007 tahoe with code p0449. but you also need to buy a jumper harness,acdelco 19257603, in order for it to plug in, i wish it said that in product description. even if you buy one from general motors you need the harness so it`s still cheaper than buying factory part.
B007EEHNFK|1|Unit depends on a small pulley which makes this thing spin way to fast and eats up the shaft bearings.  Lasted less than a month and left me stranded. JUNK!!!
B00BQP0YFE|5|Awesome
B004ZF39T0|5|Very easy to install - even in the cold temperatures of winter!  They have improved the lighting on my vehicle greatly.
B0080R46MI|1|Had thought this would work well unfortunately at 45_50 mph can barely hear music without turning volume up.. Just adds more noise to what's already happening while riding..  Own C-1400 kawasaki Concours ..  Full fairing & windshield.. Use full face helmet too
B0051D3MP6|5|I love this little device. It charges small or big batteries and I would definitely recommend it.
B000O1C47M|3|Okay,<br />I bought this pump a little while back and doing a review now. I did a lot of research and from feedback and youtube videos I made the decision to purchase this vac pump. I believe in the manual it says this can pull 28-31HG, somewhere in that range.<br />Now, this was my first vac pump and I didn't know much about them other then a few hours of research online.<br />I noticed on the gauge it only went to 25HG. I thought maybe it had a break in period. Used on a few more occasions and still only 25HG (don't think its the gauge). It gets the job done, but I feel like I have a defective product.<br /><br />Another downside was in the picture theres a filter for the exhaust, but does not come with it. I tried messaging the seller a few times months back with no response (asking about the filter pictured and the 25HG). I ended up just keeping it.<br /><br />My friends 1Stage pump from Harbor Freight pulls 29HG. This pump is also loud.
B00CMWDVVO|4|I would like to know the part number on the bushwacker pocket style fender flares that you are selling can you please get back to me with a part #
B003TQJNGO|5|is ballin like a boss in christmas<br />he jump on the car and out the sealant on like a bossss
B000GKAZMW|5|I was able to install this item very easily and have been using it for about 3 weeks now. I really like the added visibility and the fact that I can see myself (I'm a vain person). Wondering why vehicle manufacturers do not make this a standard item. Seems like a no brainer to me. Love it!!
B00B6FBLFG|5|Fantastic! Use it on all my high end leather goods.
B009LOQJTC|3|WRONG STYLE DID NOT FIT FOR MY CAR
B004T5YITQ|5|Good quality cover. Has held up very well without stretching or fading of any kind. Nice tight fit and has done exactly as its advertized to do... protect your spare from the eleiments.
B001COAS78|5|Excellent results. Replacement worked as expected.
B00AM1Z67O|4|It's okay, 2 time purchase. I don't know how good it is unless my car can talk.
B000KKND3Q|2|Didn't work...
B0054LQZRC|5|THE VOLVO LOGO KEYCHAIN IS HEAVIER AND MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE LOOKING WHICH DEFINITELY MATCHES THE CAR. GOOD QUALITY AND NOT THIN ALUMINUM FEELING.HELPS ME KEEP UP WITH MY KEYS SO MUCH EASIER. CAN RECOMMEND THIS PURCHASE TO OTHERS.
B000B8GAOQ|1|Says it fits my truck but this cap is completely different from the stock one. I wouldnt trust what they say it fits and what it doesnt. I wouldnt recommend this product.
B001EOYIEA|5|This was super easy to install. Hole lined right up. I have a 2004 Impala Just pulled the two bolts out of the muffler bracket and bolt into place. Well Almost. I really thought it was going to be a real pain to get the bolts in place but the supplied Bolt Fish Wire is AWESOME. Fishing the bolts through the holes was way easier than I thought it was going to be. I would recommend this hitch to anyone.<br /><br />Price was way less than other places I looked and on prime made it even nicer.
B003GXC59C|5|I love this sticker! I bought it for my tool box.
B00DLZZ9BG|5|DO NOT BUY THIS INTAKE IF YOU WANT BETTER MPG. You will find yourself stepping on it just to hear the intake howl. AFE build on this intake is great. 20 min.install. Just be careful not to break your air temp sensor. I love the sound. Throttle response woke up. I found it the cheapest on amazon. Well worth the money. It's the only mod you need on your Jeep. Im running this intake on a 2013 Jeep jk Wrangler. My friend has the same Jeep & he drove mine. Now he is going to order the same intake. Don't forget to disconnect battery to reset ECU to learn the new intake.
B00NSGCVWI|5|Seems to be good wire. 18ga and nice soft flexible insulation. One wire is copper colored and one is silver colored but my understanding is that they are both copper, just that one has been colored to make them distinguishable from one another.
B0098WSHTC|5|Sooooooooooo I was gonna buy the $40.00 specifically made for the Nissan Cube sunshade but decided to give this a go for ten bucks. Woah. Perfect. Could not be happier with this product, works great, fits my Cube perfectly AND collapses into a disc.<br /><br />Did I mention it was like ten bucks? Best Deal of the Year!
B000BV01CA|5|Ordered this grill as Camping World no longer carries the burner.  Best table top grill I have used,  Last one lasted me for several years.
B00DE7SM42|5|Excellent product
B000EH0ORI|3|I bought this item with the idea that I could drain water jugs into the tank of my boat, and I had the idea that I could get a siphon going and drain out the dinghy without bailing her. The metal part requires you to move it up and down and as long as you have at least 8&#34; or so of depth it starts and works well.<br /><br />The problem is that if you're trying to get the siphon to work without that depth, it's not going to work. I tried filling the tube with water and that failed. You've just got to have some depth to get it started.<br />So I tried another tactic. I drained my 2.5 gallon water tank (which once started will empty completely) ... so I drained it half way using the siphon and then attempted to restart the siphon. It wouldn't.<br /><br />Initially I thought the problem was with the siphon so returned it. I love the no-hassle return Amazon offers. Still the new one functioned EXACTLY like the original so the error was mine. This siphon DOES NOT WORK unless you've got at least 8&#34; of &#34;pressure&#34; to work with.<br /><br />That said, I am keeping the product. I'd rate it &#34;okay&#34; because it works but not quite as well as I'd hoped. It does empty completely my water tank (down to the last drop) if I start when the tank is full so it's earned it's place aboard, though it's unlikely that I'd recommend it without strong caveats. Thus the 3-star rating.
B0058FEX82|4|Just got the sissy bar in the mail today. Arrived sooner than I expected.  Nice looking product. The only complaint is that it should come with at least a diagram on how to put the backrest and brackets together.  Very satisfied so far though!
B000E3EXD8|4|I looked at alot of seat covers & liked the way these looked online, so I thought I would take a chance.  They fit nice and look good. The hooks that hold it all together, however, are plastic & very flimsy, one broke when I was installing the cover. Luckily, I had a metal &#34;S Hook&#34; left over from an older pair. Other than that, I like them.  UPDATE:  I should have waited to a little longer before I gave my review. Although I still do like them, there is nothing to connect the bottom part of the cover to the seat, so as you get in & out of the car, they ride up a bit. I realized a couple of weeks ago, my sister has the same seat covers on her car & just about every time I get back in her car, it has come up & I have to pull it back down over the seat. I think mine fit a little longer over the seat bottom, so I'm hoping it will not be as bad as hers. I did not change my rating, but I would deduct half a star if I could.
B005FM0ZRG|5|Looks great! All bolt patterns on point and also easy installation on a 97 chevy. C1500 would buy again any day
B004H9RK76|5|I am a very strong believer in Coexistance. This decal sticker for my back windshield is a perfect was to express to others my belief in Coexisting with all. No matter race, religion, sexuality, political views, etc. This decal is VERY vibrant in color and will look absolutely beautiful on my car. ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! Perfect product, 100%!! VERY happy customer (:
B003VBOZAQ|2|I ordered the drivers side tail light, and the passengers side was sent.  now i need to deal with returning the wrong item and getting the right one.
B006F8VUN2|5|Enough insulation to do thier job, but thin enough to have GREAT control over the snowmobile.  I have 2 pair and change them out halfway through the day.  They are waterproof against the skin but the outers will get wet and freeze after digging out your (or your buddies) sled once or twice.  My other pair are LG and the fingers are a touch long for me, these are slightly tight but seem to have worn in on my first use.
B001GN6MX4|5|Nice product. As advertised. Shipped fast. A+++++
B00FADDOL4|5|I'm an Electronic technician. I have extensively researched Flashing Third Brake Light products for the best one on the market.<br />In fact, I was so disappointed with available flashers on the market that I designed my own (with the features that I wanted.)<br />With limited time to construct my design, I started trying to find one that had the features that I wanted...none could be found...EXCEPT THIS ONE !  This is the only &#34;flasher&#34; I have found that is programable. All others, you are &#34;stuck&#34; with only one mode ! I can program this one  EXACTLY to the modes I want !  Don't go buying some &#34;single mode&#34; flasher. If you want more modes that you could ever use, get this one !  Looking for the best one on the market?<br />THIS IS IT !
B00062ZIIQ|5|Cheap add on item that is useful for wire routing. I have ordered these twice. It is worth noting the first time they were grey and the second time black. Yes I painted the grey ones black. I keep these in my tool box for a quick fix
B005VSIHHE|5|It is better looking in person, much more like gold leaf than in the photo. Arrived quickly and I am very satisfied
B00OJZ1Q82|5|I absolutely love them!! I'm one happy customer :)
B00405EH64|5|I am very well the vehicle only had to make some adjustments.<br /><br />excellente stay 100% original product.<br /><br />I look perfectly whole installation
B0085YOIW4|5|Bought this jacket for my husband.  He really enjoys this jacket is nice an light for summer.  If it is nice out side during the winter he will use it for riding, instead of the other jacket.
B00IPS4APU|5|Worked great, getting the four auction cups back up without one reattaching was the only hassle
B00ELUVIT2|1|Would be nice if an extra key was sold separately . Lost my key and have no way of getting them off my truck, my wheel bearings are in dire need of being replaced ! Help!!!!
B0013DIJX8|5|Very easy to install - nearly plug'n'play  Works sice 6 weeks on very bad roads and high speed too
B0006JLU1I|5|Good heavy duty lid . I won`t have to worry about it breaking in storage! May not need cover to keep light out when sleeping.
B0024NSGYS|5|great fit better than I expected
B0007M4MKA|5|This is a great hitch, and is very easy to use! Our mechanic didn't have any problems with installation. I have had a B&W turnover ball hitch before, and had trouble pulling the lever out to release and turn over the ball. (I'm female. My husband said it was fine.) It looks nice in the bed of the truck, and the plate is relatively flat when the ball is turned over, so hauling things in the bed is no problem. And I love the metal loops to hook the safety chains to. So much easier to use than the B&W and much less expensive!
B00AMTRYOY|5|Worked great
B00CCSD5U0|2|I can't tell you much about the tint since I still have not received the Item after 2 weeks. SO if you need it anytime soon buy it elsewhere.
B0041MCLHS|5|I pressed these into my 2003 SVT Focus knuckles. As stated already, the outer race will pop off with the old hub and its a pain to remove, so save yourself the trouble and get a kit like this with new hubs. I used a 20 ton hydraulic shop press and used the old bearing to press the new ones in. Used a socket to support the inner race to push the hub in. The black side is magnetic and goes towards the sensor as verified with a paper clip. Nice quiet ride and no ABS issues.
B003VGL20W|3|I was kinda pleased. I received the shipment in  two parts and they are slightly different in color.
B0002Q81W6|2|Bought this to tidy up an annoying hanging 4 way flat connector. However this bracket is a disappointment.<br />1. It arrived warped and with such poor tolerances that even when closed and bolted through both holes it barely grabs the (Hopkins brand) 4 flat connector. Certainly not enough to hold the connector while plugging/unplugging. Going to have to add some glue inside to hold it all in place<br />2. Contrary to another reviewers comment and the pictures - it does NOT come with the connector cover.
B00AC6Y8E6|2|I bought i t and it worked perfectly, it is a great size, fits perfect on the back or over the tank. The problem was a week after been using it I notices some shiny spots just where the magnets were placed... I never left the Bag on it, I dismounted all the time... My bike is Black Matte... I don't know if it has something to do with matte colors... But this was really bad because I can't use it anymore and there is no other way to put it.<br /><br />Be careful if you have a Matte color bike.
B0042U4YFQ|3|there were a lot of run's in the weaving,will have to see how it holds up at beach with camp chairs and tables. looks nice.
B00Q3JTUDU|5|Absolutely one of the nicer covers I have seen for the money.  It has a great leather feel and look - definitely fits with my new F150 black interior.  Some others say they had to warm it up in the sun, but I didn't want to wait (impatient like that).  I was able to put it on with a bit of effort..but pretty quick (under 3 minutes).  I've had it now for a few months and it looks just like it did when I got it - easy on the hands and looks great.

B007OSL3DY|5|Excellent product, installed in minutes. My Ford F-150 has the camera under the logo on the tail gate, high theft item. This may protect against theft, if not it will slow the thief down. Would recommend to others.
B000NSMXS6|2|These do not fit well on my jack stands. Like the other reviewer said they tend to pop off and shift around while lowering the vehicle. I thought after I used them once the weight of my car would press them on and snug them up. They popped back off when I pulled them out from under the car. Another thing that I want to mention is that the picture on Amazon, as of 10-30-11, for this item shows a round service jack pad along with the jack stand pads. THIS DOES NOT COME WITH A SERVICE JACK PAD AS PICTURED!!!!  I was under the impression that I was getting a service jack pad with the jack stand pads. Shame on me for not reading the description more thoroughly.
B003YP7ERA|1|DID NOT WORK.WHAT MORE CAN I SAY? IT IS WHAT IT IS AND WHEN YOU NEED SOME THING YOU TRY FOR THE BEST PRICE BUT ALSO GOOD QUALITY
B002IBFUNG|3|Yellow not as vivid as I would have liked it. I get comments on how nice they look and they do work fairly well, but the yellow is more washed out as I would have liked.
B003UT3XKC|5|Works great. No flinging at all.
B003NV7WXG|5|WOW, these little pods bring the glow for sure. Simple install, an hour later you are good to go. Get them you will be glad you did.
B00G24AGDY|4|Took a little time for shipping but happy with product.
B000V2SQQW|1|Filled battery with sulfuric acid, charged it and was dead within 2 days. Took bike  to mechanic and he tells me battery is defective, battery is leaking from both cable connections.
B0013FXW38|5|Excellent product and timeliness
B00HGJEN5G|5|came in ASAP. price is reasonable.
B0097CDL76|5|Wish the instructions came with it! One hint, after you have the instructions, at the end where it says to hold down both buttons for three seconds, you will probably have to hold them down for up to ten seconds for it to program.
B000CRDMS8|5|Great price for Gates belts. A fraction of the cost from Honda. Fit and worked perfectly.
B004XE5L58|3|product should be covered due to weather it is fading the writing<br />sticker is slightly smaller than normal but looks beautiful. Moisture<br />will destroy its vibrance
B0002UQAXY|5|I highly reccomend this with the Meguiar's DA polisher,  perfect to use with Meguiars Ultimate Polish! But make sure you remove any contaminants from your paint beforehand!
B004UPZVSC|3|i works
B007RVR3X2|5|Perfect fit, easy installation.
B006ILUAU0|4|Fell apart after a few months, but easy fix and saved a bunch of money.
B000BQWQ0A|5|Perfect replacement cover for black and gray tank vents due to sun damage.
B0015QL1BA|1|I bought these headlights and they burnt out and melted my wire harness withina week had to buy new lights and pig tails to fix the wiring harness.
B000C44DKC|4|back to squealing tires!
B008DR3ZN6|5|great quality vs price, strongly built and well engineered. better than competitors.
B00JBNYYQ8|1|This did not do anything for minor or deeper scratches on our car. Very disappointed. I also tried it on chrome, it didn't work there either. Don't waste your money.
B002A4GKTO|4|The orig VP cap failed almost immediately (seam split).  This one seems to be holding up fine, although should have never needed in the first place.
B0014L3VNC|5|Love this sticker it  goes well with my Fire Police sticker
B00AKAZ6YK|5|Right part and perfect fit. Would recommend this for anyone who needs this part. Easy install, no problems since installation.
B00168V1X0|5|super rack
B0018YE9CW|1|It was not the right size for my vehicle.  Even though it said it was a perfect fit.
B00RMRO9Z6|1|Didnt work
B000WJEPCI|1|1.  First unit CAUGHT ON FIRE when I attempted to use the air compressor.  Smoke was billowing out of holes.  Compressor permanently damaged.  2.  Replacement unit arrived with AC plug/outlet FALLING OUT of unit, and won't snap into place.  3.  USB port _NOT powerful enough to charge an iPhone 4_, which WAS the main reason I bought this.  I bought this because of the ORIGINAL price (<$100), and features.  I was very excited to get it.  However, it is so heavy/large, that it costs >$20 EACH TIME you have to SHIP IT back to the manufacturer to get repairs done.  Buy this only from a retail store where you can return it in person.  The only reason I am giving this 1 star is because the SECOND unit APPEARS to be functioning correctly, despite AC plug falling out.
B005VTT3JY|4|Good quality part for the money. Instructions very vague, had to figure it out myself.
B000C9SJUC|2|This was purchased to cure the small leak error.  replaced it and no more issues until now.  Looks like this one is dying early bummer.
B0031I2SNK|5|pulled them out of the box, cleaned off residue with brake wash & installed in 25min, my daughter was back on the road without the jiggling of the steering wheel every time she braked, she was happy & so was I, I could have possibly had the old ones turned , But by time I took them in & the picked them back up........the new ones paid for them selves without me chasing all over the place.
B00I0MSN40|5|Great product and so light and the best grade aluminum just as strong as the very expensive high priced lug nuts I have bought for my race car. 5 out of 5 stars for the product but only 3 stars for the company as they sent me the wrong size and this was not shipped from amazon. They should know the difference between 12x1.25 and 12x.1.5 mad i got the wrong size but cant beat the price for the product! For you car kids out there....... 12x1.25 are for nissans, subarus and 12x1.5 are for Evos, lexus.
B00NRVACSY|5|Significantly better than a lot of the other brands out there.  Would definitely buy again.
B00CAYB6CA|5|Amazing and easy install on my 2015 FLHXS! Had them on my 2007 FLHX and knew I had to have them again! Best grip I've ever used and looks so much better than the traditional ISO without losing the comfort
B004GEYHGY|5|Part arrived on time and was as described.
B0042HK66A|5|Works great, perfect fit.
B00F9K3JKO|1|&#34;High quality vinyl&#34; &#34;durable&#34; and the very patriotic nod to &#34;AMERICAN WORKERS&#34; are all well and good but I received a printed sticker not anything close to vinyl like I expected. It was cheap so you live and you learn. Please update the description so people get an accurate expectation.
B000CNHGIE|5|I have seen my 1998 Tacoma go from 22 Mpg's to 28 with the Air on and 32 Air Off.  I would recomend this if you already have Stuck fan clutch ( I swore that my truck was being pulled by the stock fan)  Easy to install.  I did upgrade the alternator to help with the added strain but it was an original.  I have had the Fan on the truck for 15,000 miles with no problem.  It was worth the money for the added performance and mileage. I don't even see the truck getting over 190 degrees (it calls for a 180 thermostat) with the Air on.  Very Happy.
B00AMNJBLY|4|Installed on my 2006 HHR.  Old discs were warped and causing a &#34;wobble&#34;/vibration when braking.  These replacement discs cleared the problem right up.  A good cheap (price) alternative to the OEMS.  This is my third set of front discs (in 116,000 miles), the original (OEMs) lasted 42,000 miles, the second set were good for 70,000.  I've had these on for several thousand miles, and are a solid, alternative to the OEMs.
B00IZNQAJ4|5|Awesome!! I got the taillight assembly on time. Thank you!
B0051ZXCQS|5|Used 0w20W oil in truck for about two months. Engines seems to run smoothly after cold start. Unfortunately the company seems to be no longer operational.
B004VR0RFG|5|Fits perfectly, looks sharp, costs way less than other steps, and has a great finish. What else can you ask for?
B002UC30AS|4|This set is very nice.  The graphics are excellent, and the way they store the states is excellent for use.  The adhesive on the back of the large outline sticker (that you put the individual states on) is strong (which is good, for longevity, but makes it hard to place it perfectly).<br /><br />I have a friend who runs a sign shop, and I've watched him install vinyl signage on vehicles several times.  Because of that, I knew that, if there's a bubble you can't get out by \\"rolling\\" it out with a credit card or your fingers, you can make a microscopic hole with a pin or knife or something in the middle of the bubble, and \\"roll\\" the bubble toward the hole.  Without that knowledge, I would have had bubbles all over this thing.<br /><br />I love it - it looks good on our trailer, and storing the extra stickers is easy - we just put the whole sheet on the bottom of one of our storage cabinets, since we don't need to get it out but every once in a while.  Thoroughly recommend.
B0040CTTH4|4|Fast shipping from the vendor, these fit on a Mitsubishi Lancer door panels, trims, trunk trim.  Only gripe is the very top portion that you see is brittle unlike the factory ones which are flexible.  Still recommended if you need them as replacements.
B000PJD7HY|5|Had been using four gauge 20 foot long cables which served me well Ireceived a call for a jump start on a older model Cadillac this particular vehicle was cold as ice it would not jump after sitting for about 10 minutes on the four gauge 20 ft long I had just bought the Coleman 25 foot long from Amazon which I felt were a bit pricey for the extra 5 feet the vehicle started immediately so as a reminder to my fellow roadside providers always by the best 5*****
B004YID65A|5|I have a 2-wheel drive F150. I had to cut holes in the bumper Valance to install this unit. 4-wheel drive F150s have holes in the valance for tow hooks.
B001BA0EAO|3|It says no where in the description that these headlights are blue, they're not designed to be blue, they're not significantly tinted blue, they're designed to be white headlights, or close to it. I have to say the performance of these headlights is average, the color is a little bit lighter than standard headlights and make things just a little bit easier to see so it's worth it, but if you're looking for those neon blue headlights you see on the road these are not for you. Consider getting an HID kit or bulbs that are tinted a deeper blue/nitro blue. Otherwise these will work perfectly for you, a good balance between brightness and longevity as compared to the silver-star series.<br /><br />3 Stars for Quality and brightness<br />negative 2 for false advertising packaging.
B004W97FBM|2|A lot of cable work. Old version has 4 bulb, that one just 3 and connections are different. Lost 2hrs and 100US$ extra :(
B009EABUV0|4|Awesome
B000GZQB8Y|5|Excellent quality and works like a charm. small and low profile.
B004JV6OMO|5|ok
B004NPR0EM|5|I had heard about Texas Tea Synthetic Oil and I am very happy with the results. It is a API rated oil, at a great price. It is also a real 100% synthetic oil. I waited to give the review after using the oil in my 2007 FJ and My wife's 2010 Armada. I had been using Pennzoil Ultra, which I love and still think is a great oil. But the Texas Tea has been in for about 1500 miles in my FJ and it feels smoother.<br />The only downside I can see right now is the oil bottle. It looks to be a late 80s early 90s refuge. The cap does not comes off on all the bottle unless you yank it off and then spill oil. I can look past that for the quality and the price being so well. I think in another 3500 miles when I change it I will know for sure what the results are.<br />Great true 100% USA made API rated Synthetic oil.
B0031FPL3W|2|Sent back due to poor quality.  Was offered another one at no additional cost
B0015PK3AG|5|This is the tool that my Lexus dealer uses to remove the oil filter when changing oil on my LS 460.  I also fits my Rav 4 filter so it may fit other Toyota vehicles.  Toyota switched to this type of filter assembly so that they could raise the oil pressure in the engines so it is not a spin off throw away type.
B00KWNUIHK|5|Easy to install!
B004SZFCPG|5|ask any knowledgeable radio shop,I think they will tell you the smaller wire transmits better than the bigger one on the road king.
B0046NUOLM|4|My son needed this part for his Truck. And you had it, so I got it for him! Thank you!
B003UTH088|5|So easy to program.  It's exactly like the one GMC wanted to charge me $150 for.  I plan to order another one soon.
B004I0NBK4|5|good price for a great product
B00DGZN4EU|4|The battery is working for about two months now in the house alarm, no problems. All the electrical parameters are OK (I never tried to discharge it, so I do not know the actual capacity).<br /><br />The only wrong thing is that the terminals were wider than on the original Elk battery, and the connectors did not fit. When I trimmed the terminals (it took about 5 minutes) I was able to connect the old connectors.
B007LIBJPO|5|I just received this leather steering wheel cover for my 2006 Lexus LS 430 and it is very nice! Matches the interior really close and accents the luxury of the wood trim. So far, too soon to be able to see how well it holds up over time but right now it does make a very big difference in comfort while holding the steering wheel. I have big hands and gripping the stock Lexus wheel was just too skinny. With this I notice that I have a little control of the steering especially when turning corners or pulling around another vehicle. I really have to give it a try when going on my next road trip but, from just cruising around this evening definitely made a difference. It does take some patience and strength to put it on the steering wheel as it fits very tight and snug. The trick to putting it on is to start by lining it up at the top and then working down around the sides. Then, I paused for about 20 seconds to let the cover slowly stretch itself out. Then I started pulling on it some more to get it to squeeze around and up onto the bottom. In total took me about 12 - 15 minutes to complete the task. You'll love it!!!!
B0056OFWVM|5|Used twice so far. work great. love the retractable part and no strap flapping in the wind when in use.
B00Q34A2BE|3|Functional, comfortable and blends in well with my vehicle's interior.  One caveat (which is why it only gets 3 Stars), the STRONG, pungent rubber order at opening the package and the two weeks I had to leave it outside &#34;gassing off&#34; before installing.  It has been installed for two weeks now, and thankfully the odor has diminished to minimum.  So if you or your spouse are sensitive to odors, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.
B00B2AF5LQ|5|A+! Perfect fit. Thank you
B00EP9BX6W|3|Good product arrived with a dent in the end.
B002X6VXL4|5|These are better than any other I've seen or researched.  I have bought 4 of these, for myself, and everyone I care about.  It's a safety MUST HAVE and the full charge provides enough juice to fill up all 4 times and still provide a jump.<br />I did a lot of research and this is even better than the much higher priced units, don't waste your money
B00AC6SAZE|5|Very pleased, works great
B0002SPCAI|5|This stuff is beyond good. My leather in my vehicle looks like new because I treat the seats with Leatherique twice per year. If you want your leather to stay soft, supple and beautiful then try this product.
B000CGG1WI|5|My 92 F150 5.0 was getting just 8 mpg. I replaced the engine coolant temperature sensor and now get 15-18 mpg depending in what type of driving I'm doing. (On this truck, the temp gauge gets a signal from a different temperature switch and will not read wrong when this sensor is bad.) I highly recommend this high quality part.
B00DCULNXS|5|I had some ceramic ones I got from a Cycle Gear store that cost twice as much and let me tell you, these are the shiznit compared to those.  Whoever would criticize the size of the leads is just out of their mind (you upset it won't clean your bike for you too?).  If you have used others and never used load resistors before, this is what you want!
B000JFL8SO|3|THE SPRING KEPT POPPING OUT I WAS AFRAID I WOULD GET HURT  MADE VERY CHEAP
B007EXP006|5|Perfect match, easy to install.
B0009H51U8|5|Fits my 2007 Nissan frontier perfect, price was great and shipping was fast. Can't ask for anything more.
B004CF2SDQ|5|fit great
B004OK5SS6|5|Best deal available !
B00FTB3L06|4|Item fit but had to install then upside down because the hole sizes didn't match the way my original were mounted... but it still works this way but because of this I give it only four stars
B000WYYP14|5|Very good product
B00AB2IGV2|5|I would recommend this to any and all Flex owners.  Give your vehicle a whole new look.  Real easy to apply to vehicle.  Looks awesome and you can't beat the price.  Thank you...
B000CSCF4E|3|Had to get a new remote because the lock/unlock button on the original broke.  The new remote would work intermittently and finally I returned for another which has worked well so far.  Great return by Amazon and I really appreciated the service.
B0049C9XDA|3|Could be a little stronger. Not as strong as factory.
B00KWM8C6U|5|Looks great in my Toyota Avalon!
B000BO6MBG|2|went away and when i got to my spot all my things were wet ,so good for it saying water resistant
B007DIXZAO|5|Absoultly love it! Everyones like where did you get that sticker! Makes me happy cause i drive a dodge, some thing that would be a decepticon!
B003TPQYPI|5|This is the second one I have bought and they work great for keeping dirt, sand and residue at the bottom of your wash bucket and not in your mit or brush. If you want to prevent scuff and scratches this will help when washing.
B0017OGD04|5|This cover is a Champion brand cover that fit my HD fatboy 2004 perfectly. It keeps it in good shape and we'll see how it lasts through the years.
B000C541QW|5|Excellent--Much cheaper than the MOOG website!
B00XDIITPY|2|I expected the chrome to be more &#34;mirror&#34; like.......instead it's kinda wavy. I won't be sticking it on my bike.
B00KWMLXLG|5|how many meters are ?
B000C57NQ2|3|This Monroe Strut is a perfect fit to the 97 Mercury Villager van. It does improve ride control but at the expense of very stiff ride. Before the strut replacement, the ride was soft and comfortable. Now every small bump will give you very uncomfortable shock. I thought Sensa-Trac suppose to stay soft on small bump and stiff on large bump. It works the other way around.
B00I0WUHLM|5|This is a really big help. I was sitting way too close to the steering wheel  (with the air bag in it). This allows me to move the seat back and still depress the clutch to the floor.<br />Note: the plate that mounts to the back of the clutch pedal is difficult to slip over the clutch pedal arm. It is very sturdy and will not break as you force it over the arm.<br />2007 Convertible
B0006LA5OY|4|I had thought the product would be much bigger. I made a 600+ mile drive the day after a snow storm, it held up through all of the nasty slush and everything stayed dry. I love that it has the wheels and an outer shell. Others said it was hard to put the cover on but I found it rather easy. Wasn't sure about the tie downs that it came with so i added another just for piece of mind.
B00O7XYRQO|1|Before buying the magnet make sure that the surface you are planning to attach it to is magnetic. I bought this for a Nissan Rogue only to find out that the rear door is not ferromagnetic. Apparently car bodies are now made out of different materials to make the automobile lighter. I was excited to use this to make my driving experience less stressful. Now I am finding ways to be able to still use this magnet. The concept and the design is great and I just need to find a way to make it stick to my car without any major damages to the paint.
B000C42RSC|4|Great shocks.  Be aware that in my order, I received one white shock and one silver shock, both with the same part number.  In my applciation color didn't matter.
B0010GG7YG|5|The passenger window wouldn't work from the drivers switch; the drivers window switch was starting to fail.  This was the answer!  Popped the old one out, plugged the new one in, problem solved!
B001ABOTUA|5|took about 90 seconds to change, it makes no noise as some have experienced and i have not noticed an increase in MPG or power, but it has better filtration capabilities than the standared filters and will last for the life of the truck (07 tundra 5.8) just clean it every couple of years. i did not really expect better MPG but would have welcomed it. so over all a step up in filtration and never needs to be replaced, saves a lot of money in the long run. i would buy it again.
B00A3DPD4W|1|This seems like a nice enough kit but I was looking for a 30 foot strap and despite the product description stating that this is a 30 foot strap mine is only 20 foot and even the tag is marked 20 foot strap.
B0002JM69W|3|it works greatit keeps me cool. it's just not big enough at the bottom part, to fit the whole seat.
B001M4150M|1|A expensive monitor only, not worth the money.
B00H94LDG0|5|Great fit work good with windshield.
B00122EENE|5|This was a cheap direct replacement for my 2004 civic. Everywhere else is at least $200. It took me only 10 minutes to change this out.
B0027URE9G|5|this is a must for getting unstuck in bad areas.  heavy duty construction is great for atvs.
B000C5FS9G|5|going on two months with no leaks or issues....made in Canada...quality is great and as expected...buy it if you need it....
B00J8O1XQE|5|Using it with our 2014 Leaf. Love that it could also be replacement for original cord since it converts from 120 to 240. We had electrician come out and install 240V plug. He said it was very simple job. We are fortunate our electric panel is just on other side of garage we wanted the outlet in.<br /><br />Charges fast and efficient.<br /><br />Not sure why they don't pre-drill holes in the cord hanger. Seems very odd. Easy to crack plastic I would think doing yourself.<br /><br />Great product though. Does exactly as advertised and is portable too. We are moving soon so I didn't want to install wall charger. Great solution if any thoughts of not being in same house down the line.
B0009IR0H4|5|EASILY ASSEMBLED & WORKS GREAT. I'VE GOT A FRIEND WHO HAS SEVERAL OF THEM. I SAW HIS & WANTED ONE FOR MYSELF.
B0069TND14|5|Great Lights for the back of the toy  hauler fifth wheel
B0013V6M7U|5|Excelellent product, great value and faster than promised shipping. Easy to install. Have gotten lots of compliments! Would make a great gift for any golfer.
B000BZJ9Q0|4|it is an 02 sensor, what else is there to say.  comes with some lube on the threads.  boxes they come in look used but the plugs aren't
B007TG7HXG|2|The top section of this blade does not touch the bottom zone of your windshield, it leaves a 3in wet zone where the blade is supposed to touch the windshield.  I asked for a replacement just a couple of days after installation, and the second unit had the same issue as well.  I will try another brand from walmart and see what happens.
B0018EUDHW|5|I've been using these plugs since 1972  have never had one fail me yet.
B00BJT9Z20|5|I love this sticker.  Very easy to put on and I get so many comments about it.  What a fun sticker to put in the window.<br />I've had this sticker in my window the entire winter and it still looks new.  Great buy and so much fun!  :)
B000CAYSOC|1|Did not fit my car...
B00D0BNL5C|5|Amazing product. Looks very authentic and factory-fitted.
B000C5DUN2|5|These switches work and install as claimed by all the other reviews here.<br /><br />Be sure to follow the install instructions others have posted here.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this product.<br /><br />BTW, these also fit Mazada trucks.
B00O6T0LRS|5|Sleek and small, perfect fit and looks amazing.
B008HIVZQU|4|Good size and the red attracts attention.  I have it on my car and it looks great against the silver exterior.
B000AMOES2|2|I bought this for a train crossing sign project in my son's room.  The crossing lights were LED, so they didn't take much power, this thing draws over 15 amps (180Watts) when cycled.  Now I am scratching my head on how to salvage the project without adding a huge expensive power supply.
B004NBMDMA|2|too small
B004RFKBEO|5|I bought this rack because for 150 bucks I was getting two products for the price of one 4-bike carrier. In addition to that, most bike carriers block the rear gate. With this, once the bikes are off, the rack can stay in place -- no need to remove to open the rear hatch or gate.<br /><br />I just assembled the rack today and plan to take it on a trip from Chicago to Denver tomorrow. It is mounted on my truck and it is very heavy duty. I jumped up and down on it -- solid. The assembly was not too bad, although the instruction sheet was virtually useless -- the diagram was too small for me to see without some serious magnification. But no matter, a couple of false starts but in the end it was a cinch. 18 bolts, that's it. (Not including the reflectors.) Same size wrench for all. I also used a rubber mallet to align a couple of things.<br /><br />The rack fits the receiver on my 2014 Yukon Denali XL just fine. One note: This thing does NOT fold up for storage. You will have to store the entire rack as you see it, although the bike tire loops come off easily to use the thing as a cargo rack only -- just four break pins and two steel bars slide right out.<br /><br />I figure this might come in handy the next time I have to move a kid in or out of a college dorm, maybe without having to remove my rear seats for once. Might help with my wife's vintage business as well. And it is easier to get to than the roof rack. Now I just have to find a place to store it! It is big and heavy, but I can lift it without too much trouble and I'm no Arnold.
B00T44D1R2|5|I am a fan of 303, I have been using 303 on the dash and dried out gaskets on our older truck (1997) when it started to turn white. It has helped a lot, and I never had any problems even when the car was left outdoors most of all its life. But now with the newer cars and the drought, the car haven't received any 303 love because they just go through the car washes now.<br /><br />With this new easy applicator, I definitely will be using this on the cars after a wash, I have no doubt it will give the car a much needed protection.<br /><br />Here's a before and after, it has a nice clean glean, not shiny.
B004K80L70|5|Great quality. It looks the same as the OEM strut mounts. I wish it came with the spring lining rubber inserts too.
B000BQP4HW|5|Came in a box rolled up, so it needed some time to settle.  But, it works well.
B006EGAIII|5|Met expectations
B00F4PL2GM|5|Positive Experience.  Thank you
B0002MBBI6|1|Like so many products nowadays it comes with the world's cheapest bolts. Using a handheld screwdriver the threaded shaft stripped out first then the head, on both bolts. I had to cut the bolts out with a reciprocating saw just to get it out of the hole.<br /><br />Save yourself the hassle and buy this one instead:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007CVSBL0/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />It's cheaper, easier to install, and it works.
B000BZL9BI|4|I hope this pump performs as well as it claims. Not a direct replacement in my 97 Subaru Legacy, required modification of bracket. I added a stainless steel hose clamp and cut into the soft lower bumper in the sending unit to get this pump to fit.
B008G38WKI|5|just  prefect
B000276B18|5|This item was purchased a part of a maintenance part package and was well worth the expense. I would recomend this item to others and I plan to purchase it again<br />in the future.
B001NI7KE2|5|We used this product to move several closets full of clothes to our new residence a few miles away. It takes a very heavy load without bending and it's held up nicely for several trips. We'll continue to use it for dry cleaner trips.    The anti-slide sleeves work, but one got bunched up and took a permanent set.
B001DH6D50|5|I'm very happy with the Tail Light Assembly, fits perfect looks great, super easy to install.<br />Quality is very good, I would even go so far as to say better than the original part.
B0054KVMSA|5|I have bought several of these for my friends, myself and family. Easy to program, good quality, and last about as long as a OEM one. Lets face it, these break all the time. OEM or Aftermarket you cant beat these.
B004GO5M5Y|3|This is my second grille.  The first one only lasted a year.  This product is flimsy but very nice on dislay of your vehicle.
B00S09T8M4|5|This glove is awesome. I cleaned up my new car's exterior first with cloth and then with this fiber, could see major difference whenever I use this. It cleans up the dust quickly and also not much dust stick to this glove. I am going to buy one more.
B000OUUGNC|4|Bought these socket sets for two community tool boxes at a bussiness I own. Half of the solution was also buying socket organizers. If & when some sockets come up missing...replacement won't break the bank...PLUS so far these have really held up much better than expected...I know they are imports & I'll choose Craftsman for myself(probable also imported by now) but these have really surprised me at how they have held up.
B000E28KR4|1|The screw hole is off for installing it on a 94' DR350SE. Ended up drilling my own hole, plugging the old with a cut rubber washer and epoxy. Was excited to put it in but it was a HUGE pain in the ass. I advise anyone to stay away from it and just stick to the foam filters.
B004C6TYGO|5|Perfect fit, easy install, less than 10 minutes to install
B00FFHXUDC|5|This product is very high quality! Description is very accurate, detail fits exactly. I recommend seller to all buyers. Thank you so much!
B001N4QY66|5|Appears to work flawlessly. Excellent price . I would recommend this to a friend . Nice to know you can use any reflective tape if you run out.
B00L3WJN0M|5|Really impressed they look great on my motorcycle the price was good shipping was fast
B000HZFDQ4|5|It is expensive, but the quality is outstanding. If you are installing it in a snowy night, you will certainty appreciate the ease-of-installation more.
B003CH577Y|3|DID NOT WORK WITH MY PRODUCTS,AT THIS TIME,SCREWDRIVER WORK JUST AS WELL
B00FBGFTTK|5|I love my Volkswagen convertible and this things I put on it the word bug was a neat little deal I wanted one that said a message has been received ladybug but couldn't find one anyway I'm happy as hell
B0086JITMS|5|The decals were very sharp in the color and was very easy to apply to any surface.  Well worth the money spent.
B00884SMK0|4|I've gotten quite a few compliments from other Harley owners on how these slip-on pipes look and sound on my 2013 Harley-Davidson Night Rod Special. TAB says they rate them a 6-7 on a 10-point scale for loudness and I agree. They have a very nice deep rumble to them, not too loud, but noticeable and they just look bada$$. The only issue I have is that the bottom pipe had a slight chip in the paint near the back on the very edge of the outside curve. It appears that it was boxed when it wasn't completely dry from the powdercoating, but it's barely noticeable. I can't say the same for the scratch my local dealership put on the back of the top pipe at the last service. I'm going to have to get that fixed. Also, the welded tabs on the back of the pipes you use to secure them to each other are slightly off angle, but they are still solidly attached using mounting points on the bike itself. Overall, a superb sound and the HP increase, combined with a quality air filter (like the K&N I got for the bike), is obvious - my bike was fast before, but it is obviously more powerful and responsive (I haven't had the bike dyno'd). I do get a pop on deceleration sometimes, but this was expected from other reviews I read.
B00H5F3J9C|5|high quality just as described
B000AMOEIC|1|I don't know what this pump was intended to do but I found it to be worthless.
B00CHCUZP4|5|Nice product. I love to decorate my space and this is a nice way to personalize my car and celebrate my survivorship!
B002PXO7T0|1|does not fit my Chrysler  as mentioned in the cars fitment  by Amazon
B000NOO798|1|Sorry guys, a cheater product that contain copper and liquid silica (liquid glass) works better. But it may work in a clean newly rebuilt engine someone had bad luck with.
B000IXTGHW|1|I ordered this product because I live in the horrible  frozen land of MN in January, which gets -20 without even trying! My truck is a great truck, but it can't keep up with that temp in heating cab.  So I bought this item and from day one, until this very day it has managed to do ONLY 2 things well... sputter out a weak joke for heat - when it works, which about 1% of the time. The other 99% of the time it blows fuses like a 2yr old having a temper tantrum!  After upgrading fuse box 3 times and it still doing and the cost of that as much as product cost... well now that item is sitting out in the cold.  Would not recommend.  signed, Frozen Solid and Sad
B000C57MZO|3|I installed these on a 2004 Dodge Grand Caravan.  They work, but I have not seen a noticeable improvement in ride quality.  Next time, I will order something different.      I ordered the adjustable adapter bolts, which I think are required for this car.  The alignment shop charged me extra because of the additional required adjustment.
B005CLQ3RQ|5|As the title says, works perfectly and the price makes it a bargain!  I have had issues buying &#34;knock-off&#34; OEM replacement parts in the past, but this is a really well made unit.
B000C46HAG|5|Did not need - returned
B00K872NTG|1|It ripped the first time I used it. Also, has no hooks to attach to the snowmobile.
B00IN5BVZ2|2|The only reason my review is two stars is because the struts had to be modified to fit. The lower flange holes were too small. What a shameful disappointment. Now I'll have to think twice before ordering again.
B0000CBIK5|1|cylinder leaks air after only a few uses
B000CRHLYO|5|great quality belt.......we've bought the \\"other\\" cheaper brands & they never lasted, will stick with Gates belts, also saved over $10.00 buying it on Amazon!!!
B001KOMQYI|5|Seriously I didn't even order this and I no it's only an exhaust read what your Buying instead of looking at pictures seriously y'all are not illiterate
B0032IGWAO|5|Great fit and a very comfortable boot. The detailing is wonderful. As I imported to Canada I had to pay a duty of $38.00 and wait a while but they are worth it. The were send on time shipping was just slow due to Christmas
B000FQ7S54|2|The gaskets were rolled so tightly that I don't believe the kinks will ever relax enough to seal properly. Instructions were not included. This is not the first (or second) time I've been disappointed with Omix-Ada, I think I'm done with their products.
B003VTBFBA|5|Love the service. Love Glee Club. If you're a Gleek you must buy it. Thanks a lot for this !
B00IS9NLWO|5|After I hit a deer because of my poor headlights on my dodge ram i bought this light bar to help see at night. Installation was very easy and quick with the supplied wiring harness. But did use brackets specific to my truck (purchased from cjc off road). This light is very bright and its night vs. day with this on. I do use this on public roads but I hover my hand on the switch incase theres an oncoming car. Its been on the truck for months and it still looks like the day i received it. Over all this light bar is awesome and insanely bright.
B000LG1U7A|4|The original had lost the ability to sound the horn when locking and the lights did not flash when locking/unlocking.  When I finished programming both the original and this additional one are both working like factory reset.<br />However the instructions shipped with this did not work with my car.  I found some alternative instructions that did work and I am happy now I dont have to return it.<br /><br />2.  Insert key into the ignition switch.

Within 30 seconds of the chime, press and release the LOCK and UNLOCK buttons<br />  simultaneously then press and release just the UNLOCK button on the same remote. &#60;---This is the part that is different.<br />  A chime will sound indicating the remote has been programmed. Press and release<br />  the LOCK and UNLOCK buttons simultaneously and then press the UNLOCK button on<br />  each new remote you wish to program at this time. A chime will sound after each<br />  additional remote is programmed.
B003076AEU|4|The ground lead is too short, all the rest of the kit was excellent.
B005BN46TM|5|installed but car in storage for the winter, look great and fit perfect.
B0030DKDY2|4|Pretty awesome. Really pops the gate, better than new.<br />Hard to install alone. Figure on asking for help or rigging a prop.<br />Watch out for cross threading and alignment of new bolts going into your old Jeep.
B0068FVCVM|4|Good quality, looks good. I bought it for a friend and he is very happy about it.
B0081KM69E|2|I ordered two and one wouldn't work had to have it re wired
B00H9S71LW|5|nice scanner to use with the android App
B002ONTBMO|5|Semper fi.
B00GSAUHB8|5|i've looked a long time for a foldable one pice shade
B00651C8HG|5|Great for the price. I live in a major city and have no problems with reception. Its also nice and compact so I no longer have a giant antenna in my view.
B000YJAIUY|5|Great quality!  Glad I ordered it.  Exactly what I wanted and it is very good quality.  Would buy again.  I would recommend.
B000VAPVB2|5|Fit like a glove
B00DOQ8R70|2|The shroud came broken.
B000BL111K|4|The bulb that came with the headlamp assembly, driver's side, arrived foggy and damaged. My mechanic had the front end opened up before we noticed. Had to buy a bulb from the repair shop. Amazon credited me for the cost of the bulb, for which I am thankful. Both the headlamp assembly and turn signal assembly look great and are much clearer.  (no bulbs come with the turn signal assembly).  I would recommend checking the bulbs before you get the front end of your vehicle opened up.  I have a 1998 Ford Explorer Sport. Bought a new bug deflector and now the front end looks new!
B007BCZ56E|3|Corroded my tire valves metal on metal......bad combo. Looks good but damaged the air valve.
B006QJG3AA|5|This is the best product I have found for cleaning the glass doors of my fireplace.  I have used other products in the past which required a lot of scrubbing to get the soot and tar off.<br /><br />I took the glass panels outside to clean because this has a fairly strong smell.  I sprayed this on the glass and in the medium to lightly tarred areas, the spray left a clean streak behind without me even touching the glass with a cloth!  I was truly amazed.  There were some areas of thick soot and tar around the edges which did take some scrubbing to get off, but so much better than scrubbing the entire glass!<br /> Afterward, I used a little Windex to get any film off the glass, and it looked great.
B008LUXS3M|5|I wired the lights so that when the cabin lights are on, the bed lights would be on as well.  This way i could turn them on/ off with the key fob.  They are very bright and easy to install. Highly recommended.
B0060OVXOC|5|I ordered the bulb for my blue 2004 Corolla on Thursday night and it was here on Monday. I'm really impressed on how fast it got here. The bulb itself is a little tricky to get in but it lights up very well. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to add a custom touch to their car or just to impress your friends.
B000TYVKYM|5|This has been the best and most important purchase for my 2000 Subaru Outback. I noticed my front driver side window would go down, but not always up. One day, shortly after purchasing the car, the window wouldn't roll up and it started pouring outside. After making a makeshift trash bag and duct tape window, I research the problem. Apparently, the factory window switch might have burned out and corroded. I read to buy this part. It took about 15 minutes to replace and it works perfectly.
B0089I1LEO|4|Seems to fit pretty well.  Time consuming process involved in the velcro application, but the Tundra has a large surface to cover in this dash.
B000EDQR9G|5|We heard these were being discontinued but we wanted them anyway.  They are extrememly strong steel and were easy to install..A couple of drills into the frame and they were in.  My husband goes around the vehicle with his Ryobi and presto they are up or down depending on which way we are going.  And best of all no need to pull them out from under to store them some place. They stay in place.
B00BDVICCS|5|Thanks
B00168O4MK|5|Great Quality and exception service.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Charges my iPhone 4S perfectly. Hooked it right up to my tender cable under my passenger seat. Would definitely buy again.
B00II93Y76|5|took less than 30 minutes, no tools are needed and everything needed comes in the kit besides painters tape to cover the vehicle for overspray.
B00068XCQU|5|Fast Shipment!  Great Product!
B00B1I3TL2|4|Liked the product; fits well in 2008 Suburban; solves the problem of protecting the back of the vehicle from mud, dogs, etc. Better than many of the other products I looked at for this purpose.
B000C9I8WQ|3|The product seems to be good. However, it didn't fitment wasn't quite right. Not a fault though of ACDelco. I do love ACDelco parts!!!
B00498AP6S|1|I purchased this for a john deere d100. While it would go it had a lot of slip and caused excessive rattling. Replaced with name brand belt problem solved. Spend the extra buy Deere
B007HRV3W8|5|Hitch worked so well.  I recommend this to anyone needing a coupler for a 3 inch channel.
B0009JKI8G|5|These are good wiper blades, they don't leave any streaks and they get my windshield clean. I haven't had them for very long so we will still have to see how long they last.
B0015X622Q|5|I've been using this plow on a ford f - 150 for 5 years now on my 630 foot driveway and at the Church parking! It works great! Moves lots of snow and with the rubber blade doesn't mark the asphalt at the Church.  My drive is stone and doesn't tear it up! Plus I can push the snow on the grass without any damage to the lawn!It is well made and I have made huge piles without any damage to the  plow! I will be putting on new rubber next year but can't complain I've plowed 5 years now and plow  a couple of business's also, so the plow has made me money and paid for it self!   The only reason to get out of the truck is to raise and lower the plow and to change angles!  Great part is the plow is lite weight about 110 pound and no electric or hydraulics to worry about!
B000CGMPX2|4|It meets my specifications.
B000CHB24Y|5|Product as described.
B00OAWC26Y|3|Nice when I have it on, but it slips around with the elastic not being tight enough.
B0002MB80C|5|Bought for my husbands old truck that had a thin, hard, old steering wheel.  This has made it very comfortable to drive.  Also, it does not have an offensive odor like some cheeper covers.
B005NLQAHS|5|Great unit unit. It has status lights which lets you know that it is operating
B001DRNNOO|5|This filter fits just fine in 2002 Seq, easy in, easy out. Definitely do this yourself if you have a 02 seq.
B008Z5DN6K|5|I really loved how quickly this bumper sticker arrived at my home (within 3 days), and it doesn't even have prime shipping! Excited to be able to share a little of God with the world when I drive. :)
B000FN2VD6|5|This tool will make my life easier as I have two Dana 44 axles to do universal joints on and a dana 50 as well
B000CDAEOM|4|they work
B00F0BDPU6|5|These shop towels are great. Very durable and absorbent. We have used them inside our house too because of the great quality.
B0065KKXL0|5|Nice product
B004I14CWO|5|Great product. Fit perfect and was packaged with care. Comes with a bulb, housing and connector to attach to the harness. Works great.
B00AFV7DHW|3|mirror shakes really bad need to find something to hold it still.......no the happiest but it does work for the most part.
B00B49S6RU|4|This is a very nice and light mug. But I believe it's not the most optimal in terms of packed size. I think if you want to buy this you should consider other options on how to save space.
B009RM1TL6|5|This part fit my car exactly. With the right tools installation was a snap. Good part at a good price.
B0002STR8Q|5|These work great!  It's not even worth buying off brand abrasives, they just don't do the job and wear out way too quickly.  3M for the win!
B000CB3X4W|1|did not fit at all
B00FDX6YAE|5|great for installing LED's in older vehicles
B00CAV1KD8|5|work's great
B000CITCUO|5|Fit like a glove and really woke up my mustang.
B004YJTZ4A|5|I installed these on my 2013 F-150 king ranch.  The factory spring rate was way to soft and these allowed me to set the truck up exactly how I wanted it.  I have spacers and other lift struts on three other F-150 and these are by far the best way to get 2 inches of lift and maintain a great ride.  Perfect fit.
B000H0OR52|1|Bulb blew in 2 weeks
B000IU13M6|5|Fast shipping excellent product!
B003G0MCGG|2|The first order came in and the liner was the wrong configeration. I returned the item and the second item   came in and it still did not fit properly. I gave up  with Husky.
B006UYO85S|4|Overall  the cover works fine. The only issue is an aesthetic one due to the part that connects to the back seat. It is in two parts each with a small diameter rod running through each one. This causes the two part to be uneven. Fortunately I had a dowel rod of the same diameter I used to insert between the two to make them even.
B002917SHG|5|Love this product
B00EA0ZB7I|3|Its ok
B004O3JE3I|4|Only negative it is difficult to mend vertical surfaces but the strength is great.  I repaired broken Dash parts and so far so good!
B007RW2WUU|5|it fits right in there.. we love it.. sometimes after work i pop the hood open just to look at it some more..
B005LXTOEY|5|Installed on a 2003 Pilot. I was worried at first about getting the right part. The amazon site was great at helping me to find the right part. The regulator fit and it worked well.
B002OP8UA6|5|Great product at half the cost of OEM. Very bright and easy to install I highly recommend this to all.
B004QNU23C|5|Replaced q7 pads and after a short break in period worked great.  There will be a break in so give it 200 miles to seat.  Saved 1000 on the entire break job and have performed great for 10 k miles.  Highly recconend.
B0052ORSB8|5|Works great
B00LE6OGB8|2|Easily placed on, been a few Weeks and it's still good. Only negative is charging me 5$ shipping when package clearly states it costs 90cents. I want three more but unwilling to pay 15$
B008PBTXAO|5|A+++
B005FK8BYM|5|these brakes work great and look good too. Great stopping power ! i would recommend these brakes to anyone.
B000BUQODG|5|THESE COVERS ARE A BETTER VALUE THAN MOST COVERS FOUND IN RV CATALOGS.  THEY INSTALL EASILY AND ARE LONG LASTING. THEY FIT ALL 14' X 14' STANDARD OPENINGS.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Purchased this as a replacement for 4 year old security system backup. Older battery was smaller in both capacity and dimensions @ 12VDC - 5Ah / 3.5&#34; (L) x 2.75&#34; (W) x 3.87&#34; (H) so this replacement is definitely larger at 12VDC - 7Ah (5.94&#34; (L) x 2.55&#34; (W) x 3.67&#34; (H).<br /><br />Of course these numbers are relatively meaningless unless the battery does not fit the enclosure and power ratings are not within specs for the device you are installing it in. That said, this battery size was a little tight but did manage to squeeze in and the Ah rating is well within spec, in fact slightly higher than the previous model which is a good thing since it will run a little longer when needed.<br /><br />The biggest benefit to me is the cost which was less than half of the previous battery I purchased 4 years ago, that makes this a good value.
B00BTLEHSK|5|Nice looking, sturdy, and well worth the price. I'm so glad my daughter recommended them.
B001RMN7Y6|4|They are not the best, but with a little massaging they looked nice. had to pull up the black rubber and adjust it .It was not lined up correctly. One was grey and the other black also was missing one each side an adjustment wheel , I also had to adjusted the headlamp screws it was tight and loose. When all was done it looked great .<br /><br />If your o.k. with the extra work I would recommend it
B00556N010|1|I wonder how they can sell remote keyless for vehicle that CANNOT take keyless remote??? I bought one for a 96 Jetta. The keyless remote COULD NOT operate my 1996 Volkswagen Jetta. According to a VW website, Jetta 93 to 97 or earlier CANNOT take keyless remote.   Read this below:  \\"1993-1995 - Central Lock System w/Alarm. System as drivers and passenger door lock cylinders. To lock all doors in the car, the drivers door pin is the \\"central lock switch\\" and all other door pins follow suit. Alarm module is Silver. These cars also have a locking fuel door as part of the central lock system. The car must be \\"unlocked\\" to gain access to the fuel filler. This added feature may be added to later cars by adding and tapping into the central lock vaccum system and getting an older style fuel door lock.   1996-1997 - Same as above, but added a central lock switch button in center console. Also added flashing lights to arm/disarm/alarm (parking lights). Alarm module is Black.   1998-1999.5 - Same as above, but added *factory keyless*, removed passenger side door lock cylinder. Remotes are Banjo shaped, and Alarm module is White. - Deleted passenger side door lock cylinder. If the car is \\"disarmed\\" or \\"unlocked\\" AND it does NOT see a door, trunk, or hood open in 30 seconds, it will re-arm itself.\\"  I do not know for the models later than 1998, but NO REMOTE WILL WORK FOR EARLIER THAN JETTA 1997.
B001AVSIOI|1|This had to be cut off the new vehicle after 7 months of use!
B00BSPJ1KQ|5|This cable cable arrived quickly despite the Christmas break and works well. All necessary software was supplied with the cable on one DVD.
B000C5FUOO|3|Make sure you check the correct part number for your vehicle! The item was advertised to fit a 03 Ford Sport Trac, but it doesn't. But Amazon came through as always with the easy return and refund.
B0081KM6Q2|5|A very pointless purchase. Only cool if it's in your room. the colors are pretty bright. However, I bought it and was thinking,&#34; ya I'm so cool&#34;...then found out it's totally illegal to have it in your car. Thank goodness I had a friend to tell me that.
B002MXUCXS|5|It was exactly what I wanted and needed for my 3 dirt bikes. Even comes with a tie-down so the ladder doesn't fall while your loading it.
B004C4NVD8|5|This brush works very well for washing dishes pots and pans, sure saves on sponges and you don't have to put up with the bacteria sponges harbor.
B0046ID5EK|5|This was the easiest remote to program!!!! I bought 2. I was a little afraid that they would not work or that the programing would be impossible. It was soooo easy and they work great. LOVE IT!!!
B000C3DDKO|5|Does what it is intended to do---cool the tranny
B00MUF4Q6M|3|Screws come out of the back. Like the product, but I hope another screw doesn't fall out because it may fall apart.
B000C3XDB8|5|K&N is a famous car parts manufacture. The filter fits my 2012 Mazda 6 very well and it is really easy to install. I think it will also be quite convenient to take it off than the ugly OEM filter which I spent two hours and bought three tools to uninstall. For this one, you just need 2 minutes!
B00R33YUZI|5|Very good item
B001NTKAWA|3|Installation was a little more involved than originally anticipated.  Not that hard but requires cutting the original grill.  I was however very disappointed by the fact it was not clear that this order was only for the upper grille and not a full set.  Grille looks good but the order was deceiving.
B002303F1Q|5|Excellent quality and fits my 2000 Yamaha Venture perfectly but a word of warning on the self stick velcro attach points , the self stick sucks so get ready to use contact cement.
B004P5W66M|5|PERFECT FIT!!!
B0048KZ800|5|This tire valves caps are great. I bought them for my husband as a presents for his new BMW and he love them. He like the fact that you have to use an allen key to screw them. They also look really nice matching the rims!
B00EECM5FI|5|good value
B004EDCR0U|5|Perfect replacements for the straps I lost on my bike rack.
B000C9B5EE|5|This was super easy to change out, it only took 10 minutes, and the vibration that I was experiencing nearly went away entirely. The nuts on my engine side didn't come off, so the whole posts came out, but I was careful and was able to just put the post back into the block without any trouble.
B009DK39OC|4|Easy installation with minimum tools, although it did not come with rivets. Fits perfectly and looks exactly like OEM part.
B0052UDMY4|4|Works amazingly, programming was way easier than I thought.  It does feel cheaper than the original remote but for the price of course it's going to feel cheaper.  Overall it's a wonderful product!
B00DDZWAZW|5|Installing was a bit tedious...and that is apple's fault. I couldn't get the battery out. It was glued with a lot of gooey stuff and I cracked a couple of tools trying to pry it out. Got it out and the battery world perfectly.
B005ETCIO8|5|I've used all but one of the 10 that I had purchased nearly a year ago. So far they work great and burn very cool. Be sure to check polarity before putting your vehicle back together as it does matter which direction is positive/negative for these bulbs. Nice cool white light for upgrade older vehicles: 95 Ford F-150, interior dome and door lights, dash lights and for the and 2006 VW Jetta exterior side marker lights and possibly some interior lighting too.
B002QLBJXI|2|The day after I got these, I got into my jeep and started cutting away the piece of metal that was in the way.  I ended up having to cut quite a bit more than I thought I would, and they still wouldn't fit.  The bolt pattern didn't line up quite right and the box behind the light switch on the driver side was in the way.  It appears that some flat brackets will fit, so I ordered some of those from a different manufacturer.  I'm sure these would be great if they actually fit, but in my particular case, they did not.  If you have a newer model TJ (02-06) you shouldn't have to cut away any metal, so I'd say go for it.  Hopefully you have better luck than I did.
B001EGT3I4|5|This is a very high quality replacement for the OEM part that was installed.  Fit like a glove and made to last.
B00362HVM4|5|Have got a lot of compliments on these seat covers! I just wish they would be more form fitting... they came with hooks but I couldn't figure them out :(
B000GZMMEQ|5|When you are 100% satisfied with a product; happy days abide! This AVS product is perfect from design, to construction, to fit, to application. It took me longer to read the instructions, than to install it on the truck.<br />I highly recommend this AVS 'Hoodflector'<br /><br />Also, once again, Amazon shipped on time, (actually early), zero delivery problems.
B009SSV26Q|5|fit nice
B000P0VTG4|2|Was not big enougth to work on this lawn mower engine. I had to modify it to make it work.
B00Q2N7GQU|1|Coneected the lights to my honda ruckus and they didnt blink, stayed solid orange. Really disappointed in the product. Waste of money and time.
B0030CBIPQ|3|works good
B0002M7CX4|5|I freakin' love this mirror.  Ok, I know, it's just a mirror, but this one is kind of bad ass.  So much better than the little bubble kind.  It has a huge field of view, and it's a perfect size for my Jetta mirror.
B003U6EDLI|1|Second impression; It is crap!  I am sorry if I expect an exhaust to last longer than three years but this one didn’t even make three years!  If you look at the picture you can see where the mount rusted off of the pipe. I had to have it welded back together. The muffler is rusting as well. The whole thing is rusting. I will post more pictures.<br />First impression: WOW!!!<br />Ok, it's a Jeep, it's not a race car but the improvement was very impressive. I only drove it to work this morning, but the difference is so great I'm actually motivated enough to write a review now.<br />The sound is nice from the outside and not obtrusive on the inside. Drove in with my stereo off this morning and the exhaust sound was not very noticeable, just a low rumble at times. Definitely quieter than my BFG Mud tires.<br />The power increase was VERY noticeable. With the stock exhaust, 6th gear was more or less useless. I could maintain a speed on a level stretch of road, but I couldn't accelerate. Even a slight grade would cause me to downshift to 5th, 4th if I wanted to accelerate. This morning I was able to accelerate in 6th on a slight upward grade! Couldn't believe it!<br />I noticed that where I would normally have to floor it to do anything, now I don't need as much throttle.<br />I had previously installed the K&N 57-1553 FIPK Performance Air Intake System and noticed some improvement, but this combo is awesome.<br />Installation: Spray EVERYTHING with Liquid Wrench, twice, the night before. Especially the hangers.<br />One thing I didn't like about the system is it seems like everything is a little to short. Almost like the engineers said I need 7ft of pipe, but the penny-pinchers said do it with 6ft. It all came together, but...<br />The quality of the components and fit and finish is excellent. I would have made the hangers with stops, only one has it. The instruction were well written and the picture were OK.<br />I would recommend this exhaust.
B00MV8XWHM|5|easy to install and worth it!
B0014FKI1Q|2|I put my used oil in this, and the lid doesn't seal properly. After finishing my oil change, I put this in my trunk to take it to the recycling place. On the way, this thing tipped over (probably while I was making a turn). I'd say it &#34;spilled&#34; but the lid didn't come all the way off, but it was more than just a &#34;leak&#34; as my trunk was saturated and anything I had back there was ruined. Only positive I can say is that the opening is large as well as the bottle, but I wouldn't buy this thing again.
B0041LN1L4|5|It was really easy to install, made of a really durable but flexible plastic. Should definitely take in a good amount of impact.  Popped out the screws for my license plate, placed this over it, put both screws in, BAM, done.
B0098TJ7VM|5|Look good on my bike
B003D0AJT6|3|They keychain is ok....I wish they would have said how big it really was. Perhaps a pick of it next to an item to get an idea. My FR-S key is a lot bigger & wider then this keychain. I guess it's best not to have something so heavy hanging from your car key. Again, I just wish it was bigger. Instead of holding on to my keychain, I am having to hold on the my key when it's in my hand.
B00KTIUID2|5|Just like original but nicer color to match my Mazda.
B00KJGPN2K|3|Spekers are bad had to replace it with a different one
B003XTYLVE|5|I bought this to mount to the front of my forks for putting extra glasses in and other small stuff.  It's not big enough to hold bulky gloves but it does fit nicely under the windshield.  The closure snaps are very well made.  You have to pull up on them to release them so you don't need to force them open like a traditional 'snap'.  It comes with two leather belts to mount with but I found one worked just fine.  Got it at a great price so definitely a good value.
B00JLT18G6|5|Fit as expected. Looks just like the original one. Plug and Go. Highly recommended.
B000CICZFI|4|I only needed the clutch disk, I wouldnt use the TOB included...buy Ford OEM slave cylinder...And the alignment tool was broken in 20 pieces when I got it also, reason for 4 stars...
B001GC2LVM|5|These levelers are a no brainer! They are easy to use and do the job well. My wife can even install them without me getting out of the truck! Now that's a product every man needs.
B00AQUVC1A|5|These levers fit my 2004 FZ1 perfect. The fit and function were very good, they are shorty levers, but not too short. The levers are VERY comfortable!
B001656VW4|5|As explained in my review of VikingBags Spear Shock Cut-out saddlebags, the supplied mounting bracket was a design flaw.  Looking into other bracket options, I decided to try the Saddleman Support Bracket.  Excellent decision! The Saddleman brackets held the bags at just the right angle, while allowing a nice fit for the shock cut-outs.  The brackets are adjustable, and fit my Harley-Davidson XL1200C extremely well.
B0017ODVTA|4|Good
B006Z907TY|5|Works great on Delta and Jet Blue so far!
B000EIH0RO|1|This wasn't even big enough for my two-door Honda civic...it's more for a mini than a compact! Not a good fit.
B000GV1LCY|5|Not a lot to say, really. Looks great and it fit perfect. You just move your hardware from the old seat to the new seat. Easily done. On the GL100 Aspencade, the top box lid cannot be opened as far as original because of the deep backrest for the passenger. Not a big deal. But nice to know before hand.
B001O77CMW|5|Have had this Bestem Box on my V-Strom for a couple thousand miles now.  Easy to install- simply pull off the back rack pad, drill and mount.  Had a pelican case #550 on my KLR 650 but this looks better on the V-Strom and holds a lot more. Use a mouse pad between the mount and the case and it will solve and rattles you may have. Why Givi at over twice the price ?
B001O0CN0U|5|I ordered this kit to replace my rusted, scuffed up factory lugs on my F-150. The kit was easy to install (I just removed an old lug and put on the new lug one at a time), and the finished look is a great improvement over the junk stock lugs. The added security with the key is nice, too. One piece of advise is to make sure the key will fit with your factory tire iron because if you get a flat, you will need to be able to remove the lugs; I now keep an extra torque wrench in my truck with the right adapter...just in case.
B00GRRFLOK|5|used this to haul out bike to Sturgis bike week worked awesome
B00REXPGH8|5|Yes  it did thanks
B00NLUN34Q|1|Not at all what I expected!! My fault for not reading the details though, I assumed a bumper sticker would be typical bumper sticker size, it was very tiny!!
B00GJ1CMTQ|5|Perfect fit for my 20&#34; Texas edition 2014 suburban rims. Whoever stole my original caps doesn't seem to like these. LOL
B00O7X97XM|3|Didn't fit my engine.
B007V5FNWM|4|Battery works well. It isn't an exact replacement of the YTR4A-BS battery. Physical size is a little larger and I had to modify my battery holder to accept this battery.
B008P8FC4I|4|Good unit but you still best double check some places it will let you get into for an escape route.
B001RBCU90|4|just what I need to mark the doggy door to the back yard product has doggy prints on it and sticks above the door for the dogs to go in and out of.
B005VIMY9Q|5|Genuine GM Part, fit perfectly, was easy to install and we haven't had any problems with the Windshield Washer sensor since.
B005G5R5LQ|5|Fits the racing fuel container caps very well.  If you tighten down nicely there's no leakage.  Could make one yourself with PVC that's threaded correctly.
B003ULT5S4|3|Its a good product. Only problem is that one screw from the transmission mount did not fit properly. 7 out of 8 screws isn't bad but just had to put that in there

B009G3UL9M|5|My friend loves this sticker and put it on her back bumper...hopefully the driver in the car behind her follows the advice!
B0085X3QWI|1|The emblem came off after 3 weeks look to have melted off.  I needed to buy a new one from the BMW dealership and thats when I could see the difference in the quality.  You get what you pay for I suppose.

B0084UJIOW|5|Fit perfectly and was really easy to install.
B00B2AFLEC|1|Junk I received one that the bolts were the wrong size too large to fit and had a loose joint after I bought the correct bolts.Talked with rough country and they sent another one. Received that one and the the same thing moving in the joint that shouldn't be there. Don't waste the Money just buy a more expensive one off the bat. I now have a rusty's bar. Perfect first time.
B002SINBRQ|5|Nice set of Jumper Cables.  Good solid thick wire, end clips are solid and well connected, jaws are nice and tight and hold the terminal posts / ground connection really well.  Even the carrying case is nice and makes it easy and neat to store in your trunk, hatch or under a seat for that matter. Used them to jump my Jeep after a fun evening of a dead battery in the rain and was glad I had them.  Good price, good product and well made.
B00KLKYYAQ|5|These brakes are great! I ordered them and they showed up on time, I installed them the next day, and they work wonderfully. I put them on my legacy, the parking brake holds better, the car stops quicker, and smoother. I contacted the company via Facebook and they are really stand up guys. I highly recommend these brakes.
B004GZMQS4|5|Item is easily mounted and is what it states in the description. Item was well wrapped to avoid damage during shipment.
B007AOSAM4|5|Fits great and price is unbeatable.  Already had a spill, all I had to do was rinse it and back in it went.
B00CUQKD86|5|Bought this for my brother as he is a new grandpa and he loved it!
B00GZHC0KU|5|These lights put out a good range and good color.  Buy from Amazon for the value.... about 40% off my best local bricks-and-mortar store.
B0002SRHU6|4|Fantastic spring compressor if you don't have the space for a stand or wall-mounted unit. Thick steel, solid joints, quality welds. THIS UNIT IS SAFE, and anyone who works with springs, or has had an inferior unit brake on them (God help you!) knows what I'm talking about. It's a clamshell unit though, and the &#34;jaws&#34; don't close small enough for most sedans/small vehicles, which is why OTC has an optional &#34;Bridge Accessory&#34; ring which effectively acts as a coil/clamp point sitting beyond the retaining nut. The original accessory ring listed in the manual is discontinued, but I called SPX/OTC tech support and verified that the updated accessory, OTC part 6583 which is the same part for the new StrutTamer models, is the correct replacement part for the discontinued model, looks stronger, and supposedly fits better over more retaining nuts than the original model. YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE NEW OTC STRUTTAMER MODELS, but this unit is more compact/portable, and less expensive than the new models.
B0043AV4NK|5|Received the muffler early and I was very surprised at how nice it looked. I brought my car into exhaust pros and had him remove the old muffler and cut out the resonator. My goal was to not have the \\"ricey\\" sound if you will. And I got exactly what I wanted, it has a deep tone, and paired with a k&n filter it has a raspy noise that kind of sounds like an f1 car at high revs. and at low revs it shakes the ground. I get a lot of looks driving by and a lot of comments as well. Hands down the best muffler for the money, thanks again amazon for the awesome price and shipping!
B00C48TJ58|5|does what it says. we had an accident on the first day the camera was installed and it worked perfectly.
B008032QSI|4|After checking locally and getting high prices I decided the best deal wast this filler neck and next day shipping.  Solved my problems and got me back on the road. It pays to shop around for the best deal.
B003FWVBHG|2|One side heavy leather , other side thin and cheap. Bottom of fringe still had where the leather was mended together. Fringe on one side thin and wont last long. Why dont they match ????
B000ABADXI|5|Klien has always been good tools,a litte pricey but last.some one stole my tools out of my truck,did not want to spend a ton at the big box stores,so amazon to the rescue.
B0090S483S|3|This product shipped fast. Seems to be good quality. Only complaint is the size chart was not very correct. And you could not mix match helmet size with glove or gogle size. Good product for the price, and my child will grow into these item in time.
B005EZS19S|5|Good looking replacements for the old ones!
B000SR12C0|3|not the best

B0041U92U4|5|I have never replaced a light bulb in a car, much less a light assembly but thought I would try !  It was so easy and I saved $120 compared to the auto shop price and labor.  All I had to do was turn a few screws and plug this one in!
B00029JXP2|5|I want and buy it, so I'm satisfied.
B00AYI087S|1|Impossible to put on not made for compact cars.  Steering wheel cover extremely difficult to put on.
B001EAQTRI|5|Was having trouble with audio recording for the video and needed to address the humming that was coming over the cable line.  Between the Hum Eliminator and the Voltage hum filter I got.  Added the loop noise isolator to the direct feed to my camera and  the problem was solved.
B00EQMERZ2|5|Excellent, excellent, excellent... price, Quality and delivery. i like everything about this merchant and its valued prices.
B000FPXYDK|5|This is no name-brand seal, sold by Omix,  but seems to fit well.  It looks exactly like everybody else's, except a different color.  The quality will be told with time.
B005VWYYHC|5|Worked great at good price.
B00DDOSNZE|5|I had a lot of regular bulbs in my fifth wheel trailer and when you turn the main light switch on the battery volts would drop 1.5 + volts.  After I installed these LEDs the voltage drop was reduced to .3 volts and still plenty of light or more. Well worth the money!!!!
B001TS78LG|5|Perfect product for a 2010 Silverado I would recommend it
B003RVQF80|5|Was warned not to order keys from internet. Ignored the advice and glad I did!  Price was way better than what local dealer wanted and they worked great!
