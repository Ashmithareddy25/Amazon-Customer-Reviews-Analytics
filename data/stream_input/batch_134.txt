B005BNZ59M|5|Work great. Easy not to have to measure!!
B00Z7KIZPA|3|Doesn't fit in car quite as nice as I would have liked.
B0075IZ9GA|4|Great design, fit neatly on my the back of my car.  I am already driving the religious zealots nuts with it.
B000MVP020|5|I am now on the second interval of using 5W-40 oil in my wife's 2003 VW Passat 1.8T. The engine has almost 150,000 miles on it, and I have been running quality synthetics through it since I have owned the car for the past 90,000 miles. The engine feels incredibly smooth running this oil even at high RPMs. When I drained the oil after the first interval using it, the oil came out looking really good and thick. I am planning on pushing the interval to 10,000 miles this time, but I don't know if I will be able to hold off for that long or not. Regardless, I still feel like I am getting good value for my dollar. If there are people reading this running the 1.8T,  make sure you are getting the bigger oil filter for the extra capacity on the longer intervals. The only issue that I have been seeing is that my car seems to be burning some oil, but the mileage is getting up there so maybe that has something to do with it. I am now fully hooked on this oil.
B00YC28OUU|5|So far it's been a great purchase.
B00JIEX722|5|looking for bright WHITE light? GET THESE! U will not be disappointed. From what I can see with my naked eye, there is very little if any blue at all. Gives your Rear license plate area that crisp clean highly visible look, even lights up the ground. Great upgrade and great customer service!
B0031BDLT2|5|Great product and it arrived on time.
B00AAICNPW|5|great item...great shipping...
B0012GYXL8|5|These stars were a perfect addition to the RV for July 4th celebrations. 2 strands covered the front of the awning (approx. 16'). Withstood some showers.  They aren't very bright - but you aren't trying to light up an area with them - just add a festive decoration. Would recommend these. Shipped quickly.
B007AOQQ52|5|great product
B003S6BQWY|2|Key chain kept disconnecting
B004RNR9QY|5|will be used when we have need to access 55 gals of emergency water........no emergency yet
B004GBJSZW|5|Bought these to pull a bath tub back into place.  Results were everything I hoped for.  Great suction when you use a little water.
B000FZXJA8|5|Excellent!!!
B00GBVHQB8|5|Good glove came early then I thought.
B00633YYGY|5|COOL -WORKS GREAT
B00GWESZXC|5|Perfect color and fit!
B00ZC20NUS|5|AMAZING!!!! I truly regret only buying one. Everyone in my family will have one of these in their car. Quality craftsmanship, comfortable design, a must have for any driver!
B002MY6ZZG|5|Great stopper.  Used on synthetic rope on a &#34;trailer winch&#34; on my utility trailer.  Works great in keeping the cable end outside the fair head and providing  tensioned &#34;rattle relief&#34;.  Well made and should last.
B0012TRMS6|5|I like how the latch tightens down in to a notch on the 4-gal tank. This snugs it down good.
B00EHIO7NM|1|They arrived on time,but they were DOA hook them up according to the instructions but they never work not one time did they ever work. I was very disappointed with the product.
B003FNXNCQ|3|The color isn't quite as red as the picture shows.
B001CEG96C|5|Perfect fitment, no complaints!
B002KXJNW6|4|looks good
B00E16LTTK|5|I was totally pleased with my purchase of the optima battery.  If I need another I'll will look at Amazon.
B007RYMT7O|4|Its a great pump. It's a little noiser than I expected from the description and other reviews. It's also set to a standard that definetly is not going to work on every installation. But, it's easy to adjust the cycle and make it work for you.
B000BONJSA|4|This has served its purpose,easily installed.
B000BUU5VS|5|works!
B00K7X8WBY|5|Absolutely love these!!
B004MDEV38|4|Good product, is working well for me.  I only gave it four stars because the installation was a little more complicated than expected.  Another reviewer had mentioned &#34;tight tolerances&#34;, well mine had negative tolerances.  Holding this up to the frame, it didn't line up with all the holes.  It appeared to be about an inch short which was too much of an angle to have any chance of threading the bolts in.  I tried partially remounting it several times thinking I might be doing something wrong.  Then I double and triple checked to see if I ordered and received the correct part.  In the end, I just mounted the first side (exhaust pipe side) hand tight then fed a tire iron through the third mounting hole on the second side and up into the third mounting hole on the frame (the one without threads).  I leveraged it over and screwed the other two bolts in by hand.  Not a major problem but it wasn't expecting this and it did through me off a bit.  Other than that, installation wasn't really that hard.  I did it by myself.  The instructions suggest a helper might be a good idea and I'd have to second that recommendation.  However, I've never done anything like this before and managed it all by myself so don't let that hold you back.  I got a Curt bike rack along with this and I gave that a full 5 stars so I have no reservation recommending Curt products.<br /><br />Get under you car and look at the bolt holes this will be mounted to.  Many reviewers recommend getting a tap set to clear the threads but you may not need it.  My car was 5 years old and the threads were fine.  I ran a basic wire brush in a couple (a small plumbing brush) but then didn't both for the rest and had no problem.  Because it was so strongly recommended in the reviews, I bought a tap set just to be prepared but it ended up being an extra trip to the store to return it.<br /><br />Fishing the bolt and washer up through the frame for the third bolt hole on the second side was easy and the includedwire they provided to do that worked exactly as it should.<br /><br />There are videos on the Curt sight and on youtube that show the installation process.  I found them to be helpful, check them out.
B008BYQ6ZK|3|Pricey and a little over-rated.
B000GU0CXO|5|seems to be a quality cable but much smaller in diameter than stock HD stuff.
B00ERXG4TM|5|great product, does as advertised. great on open stretches to relieve arm stress.
B00BCRMA9Y|5|I bought these to match my new stereo (JVC-R330) that lights up red. I bought the &#34;H&#34; design. I have to say, I could not have been more pleased with the outcome. The page says that these will not fit my '99 Mustang but, they do! And they look GREAT! The red matches the lights on the stereo perfectly and it really adds some comfortability to the original leather seats. Now I won't slip and slide while driving, and my girlfriend will no longer burn her legs in the summer or freeze them in the winter! I even noticed a temperature difference when entering and exiting my vehicle. The cloth does seem thin, but that just adds to it's breathability! Overall, I could not be more pleased with the outcome. I will definitely recommend this product to anyone!
B003VAY8GI|4|These work just fine.
B00TS7YN5E|5|works great!
B000S2SKIY|4|The item was an exact fit, it wasvery easy to install and it corrected the problem.
B00M1OUBES|5|Excelente!!!!
B003XKK7ES|4|However, I am not able to put it through my key ring because of the thickness.  Using the chain included keeps coming out but I love it tho and am still using it.
B0065IWKEU|5|Great product cleans and shines like no other car wash I've ever used
B0053SYDJ8|4|Good item but you have to watch not to bend the frame tab if you need to reinstall the toe link. The tab is made of what appears to be a lightweight metal and bends easily. If you bend it, you'll need to hammer it back into shape or it won't pick up the frame and tightened properly.
B0024EC74M|5|simple and easy to use, but still effective. I will be ordering another set.
B00829HZVI|1|So, this is NOT an Aisin unit.  Boxed and labeled as Aisin, but there were scratches to the actual unit where clearly someone has scratched off the brand name and put on a cheap sticker that says Aisin.  On my OEM water pump it is engraved AISIN and TOYOTA.  This pump has clearly been tampered with and it's frustrating.
B00CP43EWK|5|It just works
B00029WYEY|5|Much easier to use with the aerosol oil
B00LYO08D0|5|The vest was very nice and arrived very quickly
B000CNHS5K|3|did not fit my application as I thought it would.
B00EHE7ZJ4|5|Excelente
B00BMJ4DRE|1|is this for the 2.0t 2013?
B000HTAH70|4|Excellent punch.  I use it mostly for placing cabinet and door hardware before drilling.  Only reason for rating 4 stars is I would like to have a cap to protect the tip and save the shirt pocket.
B005DUN478|5|Slid  right on fit like a glove no fighting to get it on tightened up with no problems.  Dose not twist or move while riding worth every  cent I paid for them I will be buying them again. Great product
B00KG12UM4|4|I don't normally write reviews but there weren't any when I took a chance on this cover so hopefully I can help someone out.  This cover was considerably more inexpensive than others I looked at so I was a little apprehensive.  Compared to other covers the fabric and construction seemed similar and warranty was better than any others I looked into ( 7 yrs vs. 5 yrs).  I bought the T-top cover in hopes it would fit over the tower on my ski boat to protect it since it has to park outside next to my house.  The cover was easy to put on and fit over my tower and still had enough leftover to cover the sides of my boat to the fenders of the trailer.  I ordered the next size up and it completely covers my swim deck and hitch as well.  I supported up along the center line so it wouldn't puddle and water would run off.  During a thunderstorm that rained about 1 1/2&#34; in 2 hours I went out and checked and there was one seam that was dripping a small amount of water inside the boat.  I tented it higher and that seemed to help.  The buckles for the tie down are covered by canvas pockets so they don't rub on the side of the boat.  It has only been a month but so far I'm impressed with this cover for the value.
B00PWG6AC4|4|works very well.
B00A810E70|5|Great price, this was exactly what i needed. Shipped earlier than expected, overall great experience
B0035GWEHS|1|Crap second pair I bought -  welds crap -  get ripped off elsewhere
B00KTHUR52|5|Awesome oem replacement. They are cheap, and they work the same as dealer oem. Also super fast shipping.
B0040CRWIW|4|Worked as described
B000BR6YEI|5|Great Strut Bar installed in my 1997 Miata strong and high quality look awesome the only thing is that you should remove the windshield water deposit my 97 Miata has the big square water deposit also I have installed a conic air filter I believe that the original air filter setup could interfere but I'm not sure about it. Make a nice difference it feels more firm and rigid.
B00KTHVE72|5|Perfect fit and works great!
B00BU3JNL8|4|Very happy with it. Easy on easy off and fits good. Have worn it a half dozen times and it's given me great protection when I have to &#34;get off the bike&#34;. Stitching and materials are holding up fine and I have no issues with it. The Kidney belt is awesome. The option to be able to remove the sleeves is slick.
B000CQFS0O|4|Been 9 months since I put them on.  No signs of corrosion so far.
B00UZA635G|5|Arrived timely and worked as advertised. The emailed instructions worked well.  Had the keys replicated at a local hardware store. Home Depot would not do them.
B00JH74C88|5|Wonderful lights much brighter than expected. Easy install and comes with many lights to place wherever you like.
B00KSXCUDY|5|Great quality...Easy application!
B000C8ZGTK|5|I forget how long it took, not a long time though and ut;s on car with new muffler.
B00SSC47MY|5|Fit and looks very good
B000WJYMMQ|5|Ty
B0007LDJBY|5|Yes. Awesome plastic welder. 5 star rating
B000WJDMRW|5|Cheap and the best quality
B000YCCP2U|1|The item came with a crack near the top right screw/bolt cover due to poor shipping, which is a huge negative based on the expensive shipping cost for such a small and light item.  The bottom two screw/bolt covers were either to small or not shaped properly as they will not lock into the frame.  You can simulate a small bump, or just even turn the plate cover over, and the two screw/bolt covers fall right out.  The top right screw/bolt cover seemed to be the right size, but would also not stay locked into the frame due to crack.  Upon a closer inspection of the plate cover itself, it has many light scratches all over it.  The scratches seem like someone took a fine grain sandpaper and went to town just for fun.<br /><br />Overall I'd say very poor shipping and handling, especially for the price, and terrible QA, if they even have QA.
B00G8R69RC|5|Thanks for all
B00540KPS8|5|Fits my Toyota truck and is heavy duty.
B000FQBWCY|5|This is just basically a trickle charger. I use it with my dual battery set up in my truck. I have an ARB freezer/fridge in the back. The short drive to work isn't enough to build up the charge on the deep cycle batteries I have in the back of the truck. I use this, leaving it attached all the time. At night when I am home I plug this and the refrigerator into the household current. It is enough to bring it back to almost full charge if not all the way depending on the time I have let it set. I like the fact that is monitors and won't over charge the batteries either. It's super simple to use, and a plug it and forget it kind of proposition for me.
B001JT0KR4|5|Bought this as my husband refuses to wear reading glasses.  So?  This works great!  Good for tiny labels, too.  Fits a large or small hand nicely, good balance, clear and readable lens.  Can't go wrong with a handy product that fits in a drawer and serves its function!
B001JSYMXI|5|Quick shipment, best price.
B00W9ODC0A|4|Very Bright but will not flex at all. Great deal for the money.
B00200C5SI|5|I've been using Dot 5 brake and clutch fluid for years in a restored TR2 and recommend it; doesn't eat the paint and keeps steel brake lines pristine.
B000M295R0|5|Good product
B007AJOQY0|5|Good brakes
B00FYX221S|1|I don't know if they are going to take it back but basically its a waste of money
B00BZZTGYU|1|Nice idea but both sets I ordered had a problem with the with the threads making the part useless. I was able to combine two sets to get one working set. Not ideal.
B007GR8EU8|1|At higher speeds it doesn't work.
B00480BVXS|5|Does a great job keeping out bees.
B0030I3L9G|5|Nice
B00IITQMM0|5|great quality of both rotors and pads. Delivery was on time.
B000E346NU|2|did not fit it broke while installing
B007T7Z6M4|1|Big and bulky and the top ankle security strap was flimsy.  I didn't even try riding with them; sent them back immediately and got the Astars S-MX1 boots.  Now those are a great boot!
B000IYNVHW|5|This is a direct replacement motor on my wife's 2003 jeep liberty.  It is been a few weeks and no issues thus far.
B003RQBKLC|5|I am SO glad I bought this.  Having two power ports and two USB ports helps a lot with the number of peripherals I have in my car.  The wife and I can both be charging our phones while using the dash cam and the GPS.  Only problem is that the sticky tape in the box is not strong enough to keep it mounted in hot Texas summers.<br /><br />Still absolutely worth it to have in the car and works reliably.
B00PM50FU8|5|Love the message, people try and say Christian's think we are perfect , there confused with the so called Christian's that run everybody out of the churches by judging them. Don't get me started, JESUS is the judge not us, understand the message, not perfect just forgiven, we've been set free.
B000FW2MC2|5|I bought this for a trip from Kansas to Michigan and back.  I am thrilled with the cup holder.  I just placed it on the floor behind my seat.  It stayed in place without having to drill holes in the car.  I had several of the 32 oz Styrofoam cups in it and they stayed better than in the car holders.  I defiantly would buy this again.[[ASIN:B000FW2MC2 Bell  CO51 Octopus Cup Holder]]
B00480J4PU|5|awsome
B009IYV0JO|5|Amazing items ... Fast shipping!!!
B003NI38MS|5|Works great and took less than 5 minutes to change out. Saved a lot of money doing it myself!
B00RW1AX02|5|Well made
B010NCXXFI|3|Pros:<br />Looks great<br />Brighter than stock<br />Will accept tail light guards made for stock taillights<br /><br />Cons:<br />Installation is more of a project than plug & play<br />Requires load resistors, otherwise you will get &#34;turn signal bulb out&#34; warning on dash and it will hyper flash (connect load resistors to black and blue wires)<br />Taillight and brake light wires were connected wrong (easy fix, bend the wires on the connectors the other way around.)
B00K2MYQ7E|5|Love my clock
B00EVIL9WK|5|I was surprised at it's stability and wide field of view.  Very well made.
B00PJPHEBO|5|works well with torque app. once connected works excellent. Great product, if you are looking for an ODBII reader get this one.
B00877SL2M|5|really a great light and very bright.
B005HTFQI0|5|Awesome helmet. Fit great, had no problems. My friend came over, tried it on and liked it so much he bought it from me. Recommend
B009AQS5H0|5|I am very pleased with it.  Looks great
B00WOYL9C8|5|Great Product
B00BK86CQW|5|Being a factory part, it fit easily. The sides of the truck are a lot cleaner than they used to be.
B008F8Q972|5|I like it everything's fine.
B000AOA3W6|5|This is a terrific high security lock for bikes or motorcycle or other items such as gates and trailers.  Best deal of all the items including ABUS that I'm compared.  I'm a mechanical engineer and former locksmith by discipline and this lock satisfies several of my criteria for protection.  It is not a 100% solution, but then nothing is.
B006WQSD1O|5|Everything was great.
B004ZF3FJO|5|These are amazing and great customer service wish I would have bought the fog lights with it. Guess I will have to order then now. Makes the truck look great
B00K65825E|4|Car drives differently than before I put it on. Maybe more horsepower, but slightly worse mpg.
B00FADIZYA|5|good
B00KDDALKS|5|Exactly as described. Fast shipping
B0058W986C|5|It really makes comfortable for my shoulder.
B00H1NI8GC|5|Fits well in your trunk
B0042L7DZ8|5|works great.
B005M2246Y|5|We may go back and put in an OEM mirror at some point but this is exactly what I was looking for - good quality inexpensive solution to our immediate problem - it fits well, goes on quickly.
B00K889FCI|5|Follow the directions to the &#34;T&#34; and this stuff performs miracles. I used it on my 06 Subaru with hazy headlight lenses and they are like new. I also cleaned off my tail light lenses and used it one them. Amazing results. If you have more than one car that needs treatment, prep them both before opening the moist wipe package, and you will be able to do them all at once.
B00GP7URXC|5|Good
B00TDANB9K|5|great, looks good...
B00PKZWSLO|5|Material is nice. These pads complements my Vios nicely so much so I even bought a pair for my hubby's Hilux.
B000LC6HKY|2|Returned this item.. Work item ordered
B000AP57U8|5|I run k&n filters in pretty much everything I own. Never noticed any great power increase. Just like the fact that you only by 1 and it last a lifetime if you maintain it
B0024ECIP0|5|Bought this to go with the juice box so I could charge my nissan leaf faster. Love the charger, extension cord and the car!
B004GF7BAC|5|Perfect
B00TU0X09E|5|Door handle arrived earlier than expected. Once I got the door panel removed (it helped that I'd been in there messing with the speakers a few weeks before), I was able to change out the handles in a few minutes. Awesome service from APDTY! My only gripe is that Chevy made these things out of plastic in the first place. If these were originally made of metal, none of us would have to do this.
B00OO2EFLU|4|did not need it so did not install
B00W51G7XG|1|Says it fits Honda XR50, it does not!
B0009JKI5Y|5|Works as it should!
B00ABYVT64|4|They're pretty good bottles for the price. They really don't leak, only one of the bottles drips about a drop or two when you hold it upside down. The hoses people say are too long but I think they're designed that way, they work perfectly without cutting. Great deal for the price/quality overall.
B00RNIVJ7K|5|great stuff
B00DJ5KEF4|5|works like a charm
B00XZ9O7I4|3|Apparently the transponder piece cannot be coded at the dealer???  The dealer cut the key and then gave me the news.  Now I have an &#34;extra&#34; key that works only for the doors and trunk....  Had to buy an entirely new key from them in order to have a true spare key at $67.00.
B000NKMXL6|5|Exelent fit for my 1987 325 is
B00SC1054K|5|Works great.  However, written directions were very confusing.  We followed directions from a YouTube video to sync our key fob.
B00PQX5M5Y|4|This is an awesome looking cover, only con is it's a thin material. My solution was to put it over a plain black cover made of a sturdier material.
B00ABZ7IDQ|5|looks and works great on my HD ultra
B004A54RQY|5|Grandfather was very grateful. Didn't take long and arrived in great condition. Exactly what he needed.
B007HROEM4|5|is what is says.  Purchased as spares just in case.
B00192JH4S|5|they are what I expected.
B004ZF39T0|4|All I can say is, WOW! I will never have halogen headlights again. Being a former parts professional for a major aftermarket auto parts supplier, I expected them to be bright like most of the high end halogen bulbs, but they are so much more. The only reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5 is that my bulbs took slight modification to seat into the housing, but no issues. Installation still only took about 30 minutes, and the plug-n-play feature is absolutely outstanding. The brightness and clarity of the down road field of vision far surpasses any halogen on the market. I will be purchasing the bulbs for my bright lights (initial purchase was dim lights only). Look no further, these lights will change your view on headlights forever.
B003TNQCNO|5|Perfect fit. Equal to OE.
B001IH8Q0A|5|Heavy and well built. Very Happy
B005RUPM1K|1|Had problem programing and has no chip in It
B00CJIXAYO|5|works perfect. holds the pass just right even the new one.
B0018YCRXA|5|ok
B0010G9ZXG|5|Perfect replacement. Easy installation!
B00Q58VQTK|5|it is great
B00UR646OI|5|Perfect fit! 2004 BMW X5 3.0
B006K9161C|5|I did't get mine off amazon..I pulled mine from a junkyard, cleaned and fully rebuilt them; installed in my 96' jeep grand cherokee 4.0 with a 99+ manifold swap and they make a huge difference!! Better gas mileage, and definitely more acceleration
B012BMRKA2|4|Would be 5 star if screws were long enough.  Had to use old ones.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|just the right size for a Ford F150.  Covers the entire windshield and the little flaps on the outer edges can be pushed into the corners for complete coverage.  Lowers the temp considerably on hot Texas days.
B0049HCOT0|2|It is very pretty. But you can't slide your chair across it. To be honest I would rather have nothing.
B00C7XZLYS|5|Correct replacement unit.
B004VJNQF2|5|Seem to be very good quality, ive put them thru some heavy duty use and they are doing great.
B005OVHHQU|2|This is probably not an AC Delco issue- the part is of good quality, but even though it appears to fit my 2013 Chevy Sonic (right length), it doesn't- it hits the other blade in use and gets pushed off, allowing the steel wiper arm to hit the glass (no damage done, but that could easily have pitted or scratched the windshield). I have a machine tool background and a fair bit of kit here at the house, so I was able to take the end cap off, cut the offending excess off the end of the actual blade, resize the spoiler, and reassemble everything in about ten minutes. After the wiper blade was the right length (I took off 3/8&#34;) I had to cut two angles and two shaped notches into the steel blade backing using a diamond cutoff wheel and a shaped bit to accommodate the locking mechanism of the end cap. I actually enjoy little challenges like this like this, but it's certainly not everyone's idea of a good time- and if you're the kind of person who just slaps things on without testing them, this wiper will fall off the first time you tried to use it- possibly in the rain and in heavy traffic. The minute I verified my fix, I wrote this review- because little mistakes like this one can kill you. DO NOT attempt to use this part on the 2013 Chevy Sonic. I have a hatchback, but I suspect the windshield is identical on the sedan.
B000JZY4D0|1|I replace my radiator on 05 caravan on 1-11-13 with  91,600 milage with the spectra premium that I bought from amazon now I have 127,500 and radiator has a pin hole on the plastic part of radiator. amazon said  it's no longer under Warranty call spectra for warranty info. they warranty last 2 years.now I need a new radiator. It only last 2-1/2 years
B00QW3KIHO|5|the all metal construction fits snug and should stand up to the demand of opening the rear door. put plenty of white lithium grease on all working parts.
B000C5UFQ2|5|It already comes with a anti seize lubricant so I didn't need the extra one I bought. The sensor worked great. The check engine light didn't go off at first because the car computer requires a few cycles to recognize the new sensor. One cycle is when you drive the car a few miles so the car gets hot and then it cools down again. I passed my emissions test, so I'm a happy customer.
B009DJYS9I|5|Great grill
B0012TYX9W|5|Worked well. Just remember with any type of lubber you will get leaks. Couple of paper towels and all cleaned up.
B00B2YE4B4|5|Very bright
B001TI5IIQ|2|Beware, you could make your headlamp look worse. The details people leave out in review is so annoying, because I purchased this based on ratings/reviews here. If you have deep oxidation, you'll have to sand your head lamps with the included pads which does do much more than smooth the surface leaving a hazy look. If you have any clear sections on your headlights like I did, you'll be disappointed with the results. It's not a &#34;magic&#34; solution that wipes away the haziness.<br />IF you have a thin yellow film, the included white clarification fluid will help. I have both yellowing and oxidation among my 4 headlights, which the product did a noticeable (not perfect) improvement for my &#34;yellowed&#34; ones. I'll return this product and try something else.
B001F799WC|5|my wife's car (2007 Honda fit) was running like crap,  bad gas mileage,  etc.<br />replaced the upstream o2 sensor, WOW!<br />Getting to it was a pain, easiest from underneath the car. and don't be suckered into a o2 socket, you can use a 7/8 (12pt) box wrench, the connector will fit through the wrench
B0002SQU68|5|Good stones... needed to remove rivet and replace with cotter key on hone tool.
B000FQ7XBS|4|It fit really well.
B00KXPSU7M|5|This really help the situation I encountered.<br /><br />There is a little scratch spot on my car and the color of this product just fits my Q40 as well!
B008VLVDII|5|This worked great on the backseat of out 2006 toyota tundra.
B00BT1GQCA|5|Good part
B009GOV7I0|3|The caps were obviously used, with scuff marks on them. However, they fit fine, and I just wanted to get the hubs covered. My 2010 Tacoma is a base model with a few dings, so it didn't matter much to me that they weren't brand new.
B0016HT5V6|4|Very good plug but some we loose in box.
B001DRLPXU|4|Easy install
B00QMVKIEO|5|Worked out great no issues!
B007ROUW2I|5|Great deal - they work great!
B00D0XH3JU|5|Looks fantastic on my H3
B000EQ8TJO|5|Put these shocks on my 2000 Dodge Grand Caravan sport and they made all the difference especially cornering!
B00S4OUU90|4|Looks great. Very hppy
B000F5ECRW|5|Works great- don't use too much air pressure or you can blow out a heater core.
B006GKRAME|5|So hot on my husbands ninja.
B00FMITO2K|5|Very pleased, super bright. Love it
B0009IQZFM|4|It's good. It didn't scratch my car from what I saw, but it is a little pricey, wouldn't you say?
B00ABZ7IDQ|1|Ordered my from another online company butfelt a review was in order on Amazon...Assembly two allen bolts attach the mount to your handle bars,,Allen wrench supplied there is a third allen which holds the cup to the mount which passes thru a spacer.Original installation the cup started to spin around and was a distraction.It was taken off and loc-tite was applied to the cup mounting screw.This only lasted about a 45 minute ride before it came loose again.At $35.00 this is not a cheap holder. This is a definite pass
B008ROAZH4|5|AAAAAAAAAAAA=++++++++VERY FAST SHIPPING. VERY HAPPY
B000N2398A|5|Good for spraying grease stained clothes!!
B000IYNVN6|5|installed easily, wires connected effortlessly and works perfectly.
B00BCG0GBY|5|Perfect for our truck
B00KVVBEWQ|5|Magellan has created a product that works well.<br /><br />Installation is less then clear.  Oh I got it installed OK but the 29 language manual is less then clear on many points.  Not the least of which is that if you are telling the GPS you are in “Auto” mode, vs RV mode, there’s no indication on screen as to which mode you are in. The only passing reference in the manual is that if you are in the ‘CAR/Auto’ mode the unit ignores all the size/weight/length etc info you input into the GPS for the “RV type” you have.<br /><br />Overall design:  Very  good.  No issues settling the unit down to the dashboard top to steady it.<br />Screen size: This GPS has a seven inch screen. This is a nice size for most all drivers regardless of the tow vehicle/motor coach size.  Had no problems with sunshine hitting the screen but an attachable sunshade would have been an extra nice touch.  What would it cost, 8 cents in volume?<br /><br />Blue Tooth:The connection worked well with my Verizon older cell phone, allowing hands free phone chats.<br /><br /> This GPS can even warn you (nag you for good drivers)  about speed limit changes and warn you when your speed slides past a speed limit<br /><br />This is a great GPS for road travel. It's as at home in a car as it is in an RV, so you only need to learn how to use one device.  Having said all this, best to set up destinations and use the unit parked to get accustomed to the many menus and setting necessary.  Do this before you hit the road.<br /><br />Have tried it around town but more reports after my first long trip.<br /><br />Update:  There are some very nice updates from previous models.  Especially great at telling you which lane to be in for the next turn/off-ramp/ etc.  Just used the unit for 800 mile trip and deadly accurate all the way.
B004W5TJME|5|Product is just what I needed!  Original order was lost or missing, but when I contacted seller, they sent out the order and all's well that ends well. Thanks.
B005JDT0GS|1|Junk don't blow ur money or time on buying
B000C846VE|5|Worked great - great price!
B009BT71EY|1|These stickers were hard as hell to fit on. Just get a whole new gauge cluster
B000C9IPT2|1|The part fit as advertised like original.
B000F79Z7M|1|Did not fit like they said it would, even after one reviewer claimed it did too for the same model and year.
B00EQ01KXG|1|There is a serious flaw with these lights. If the running lights are on and you put on your turn signal they will not flash or act as a brake light.
B004A2IFII|4|Worked like they should and came with o rings.
B0053O9FQS|5|Thick grease and well worth the money.  Last many miles and will discolor if over-heated.
B003VLBPJA|4|Was shipped as advertised and appears to be what I expected as I have not had a chance to use it yet. Coming up next weekend will be the test.
B000C7QHGM|5|The factory radiator was a single core, I replaced it with this dual core for better cooling since the truck tows a two horse trailer almost daily.  Was an easy swap and this radiator was really well made.  I would buy again.
B000BZJETC|5|Used this on the OE fuel pump on my 2001 BMW R1150GS. Just right.
B003D3TLV0|5|love them had to order new ones for our new camper
B000C9KBOO|1|The part fit as advertised like original. But know that it dose not have a drain plug.
B00IOLSPSQ|4|These may not be genuine OEM parts, but they fit like OEM and do the same job. Some reviews claim that the light is not as bright as the original lights, but they are visible during daytime use and they are extremely bright at night. It took me about 30 minutes for the first one because the housing is tricky to remove. I followed the steps on this thread: http://www.myturbodiesel.com/wiki/turn-signal-and-blinker-light-replacement-side-view-mirror-removal/  These products will fit and work like OEM, making it hard to tell the difference between these and the originals, except that your wallet will be fuller at the end of the day.
B00JI9J9JM|5|Fits my Cobra hand held cb perfect! :)
B00335HQF6|4|Not really a perfect fit but they get the job done. Very durable and easy to clean.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Fits my Jetta nicely, just don't know how to fold it back to fit into the pouch it comes with
B001TNR6C2|5|It fits a 2011 Forester perfectly. DIY installation is straightforward (required two people for lifting hitch into place). There is a YouTube instruction for this model. Ground and bumper clearance are acceptable. Hitch is extremely heavy duty compared to Subaru Forester's frame.
B00V30J86I|2|not what I was looking for and it doesn't fit my car seats.  Gave it to a friend and she loves it.
B00852684M|1|Bought 3- not one worked. Garbage purchase.
B00BD4YQC0|4|These covers look great in my 2000 VW cabrio. I added a square of 1 inch foam underneath for added cushion.
B007JMOTJK|5|Great value<br />Fits great
B00C0SQ8KG|1|Excatly the same as the less expensive Penton light bar
B00JIEX722|5|These are impressively bright lights!
B001FBIJTC|3|NO BUENO
B00IMPEWHM|5|Fit perfect
B0006IX85K|5|Just perfect for what I needed. I needed a short hose for my water softner install. Arrived quickly.
B000H0RD7Q|5|These work great in my Truck.  Love how they make the head lights even brighter than they were before.
B00GW3QM4C|4|Used pump to drain transmission oil pan, worked great. Pump will come in handy for many other projects’.
B00VFEI1NI|5|Very classy, gender-neutral, and the clip is easy to use and very convenient if you often have to remove specific keys from your set.
B00HUBXBBM|3|Okay. Could have been a little thicker for the price.Gave it away.
B004RCP49O|4|So far so good.  It went on well in the sun but was a bit gooey in the shade where the surface was damp.  Very interested in long term effectiveness.
B00ISFDWZ4|5|quality product and it fits very well.
B00UCNCSJ6|5|Haven't had to use it yet, but it's a nice idea to have in the car in case you don't have access to charging your battery if it suddenly goes out
B00C3067DE|5|Really good quality and easy to install on a 2009 Suzuki GSXR750. Works well with a jack stand.
B000SIFS8I|2|I think you be<br />What you pay for.  Fairly thin,  I felt I was going to break it.  Rubber coating us coming off.
B000C2GFNM|5|Quality gasket and quick delivery. Just what I needed works great over 10,000 miles no leaks.
B00BD9HYGU|5|Wear this helmet every day. Added an SMH10 com set for music and phone. Only gripe would be the chin curtain isn't removable and hits the boom mike but that's not the helmets fault. Comfy and light does what its designed to do.
B0055DP5AW|4|These foot pedals do the job needed. For a passenger they are ok. They feel like they could be built a little more solid but over all, great product for the price.
B00BCRMC3I|4|These seat covers were pretty easy to install. The back seat doesn't fit as well as I'd like in my Xterra but it looks nicer than the seats that are in it. I love the color and think they will hold up well.
B00F0M3FLY|5|A great product for the money. They aren't the strongest but for under $200 you can't go wrong. Installation was easy. It was a lot harder removing the old ones.
B00D3M9B3Y|5|Works perfectly. It's Incredibly accurate. I use this almost weekly and it's perfect every time. Easy to apply and absolutely accurate. I've compared it with 2 other gauges and it's always spot on.<br /><br />It's worth a few dollars more for a digital gauge (which professional reviews seem to rate consistently more accurate than analog on higher end gauges anyway) and for one with the bleeder valve. It makes getting the exact pressure, so much easier. I've used this on everything from cars, motorcycles, bicycles and even hand trucks.
B00GMSYEFQ|1|as one review already stated..wrong dimensions. is not 38mm/1.4999&#34;. incompatible!
B003E2WQE4|3|Pretty good, but I partially crushed the tubing assembling it.  I don't think it's compromised and I carried a 180 pound small motorcycle on it without a problem.  Also zero instructions .. though you can find a video on line.
B001Y8NF90|5|One of the better awning tie downs I have used
B000E0IADA|5|Great sized lights for tight applications! Bright and very self adhesive.
B000C9TPGE|1|Original pump lasted over 20 years and over 200,000 miles.  Replaced with this pump which failed in less than a year now a year later the second pump failed.  Purchased this trying to get the most reliable possible, just another GM junk product.   Looks like these are just junk items with ACDelco name and box.  These are not easy parts to change so I wanted to buy the best possible pump but after two relatively short time failures I am very disappointed and fed up with GM and ACDelco.    Make sure you order the correct filter for this pump.  The one listed for my vehicle will not work with this pump.  The correct filter is ACDelco TS32 GM Original Equipment Fuel Pump Strainer, or equivalent.  Amazon says this filter is incorrect for my vehicle but it is the one to use if you are installing this pump.  The pump works as a replacement for the original pump but the filter is different.  I ordered the one that Amazon says fits my vehicle and had to go to a local store to get the job completed.  Hope this helps you avoid the issue I had. I ordered the one Amazon indicates for my vehicle, ACDelco TS40 GM Original Equipment Fuel Pump Strainer, but it will not work with this pump on my vehicle. UPDATE:  After vehicle has been in use for more than a half hour pump begins a loud squeel much like the sound of a distant emergency vehicle sireen.  This is not an easy part to replace so I wanted a reliable part is why I chose AC Delco.  This is one of several problems recently with ACDelco parts.  by ACDelco
B009QKEU7E|5|Don't use the crush washer that came with this. It leaked and I had to go to Subaru and get a new washer. I should have got the oem washer in the first place but i was lazy. Dont be lazy. Otherwise its great.
B0051UGTYK|5|I'm a water operator.this does a great job keeping chlorine off my carpet.fits perfect.wish it were a bit cheaper but cheaper than most.
B00C53LVLC|5|Works great. Good price quick shipping
B001TNFF0W|5|Easy Installation works great with 5th wheel.
B0048IY3SU|5|Perfect fit.  Easy to install and works great.  Motor operates fast, quiet and smoothly.  After cutting the four rivets holding in the old motors, I installed this using grade-8 bolts with fender washers, lock washers and nuts.
B007KPVWU0|5|Great product. Helps keep my whitewalls a lot cleaner. Great stopping power.
B00EIW1KAU|2|Worked great for about a week. Until it broke in half. Monster emblem faded the second day. Looked good on my bike, but needs to be made better.
B000FT1GV8|5|Works great I love the idea of the clips locking. Thanks for the quick service.
B00G620ZVU|5|Bright little lights good price fast shipping worth the money
B00MNMVOP8|4|Decent for the price
B00GUF74HQ|5|Best accessory I've ever purchased for my truck
B007SYA0TW|5|awesome product!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ABZ7IDQ|5|It was exactly what I wanted and expected. Quality made.
B000CMJI7C|4|I bought it to complete a set.
B00CPYC9BC|5|Quality product,  fast shipping
B006NTK35O|5|Very nice, built strong ! Have it on my mirror on my Mack semi.
B0016J8FWY|5|Easy installation. Works well. No noticeable brake dust on rims. Well worth the money and five stars.
B001KQB5V6|5|Well built
B007G2KIMK|5|It's huge but good! It cut down on the dirt that was tracked into the camper a lot!
B0085KGOH0|5|Great dump tank. Just bring your man card if you fill it all the way. It gets heavy!
B000V5Y8IO|5|so nice
B000ONZT5Y|5|used it to replace old foam in a vintage speaker.
B005BNP7UO|5|It work's very well.
B002XLHUQG|3|good quality build. product use precautions so extensive it would seem pointless to purchase for the purpose intended. get what you pay for, quality vs price seems very fair. I'm happy with.
B002X1JWTY|1|Dont by them
B0068EQ6E6|5|Great pipes easy to install looks and sounds great. I would buy them again!
B0031I0U76|4|Connecting wire was wrong had to make adjustments
B007UST696|2|For the second time I get the wrong product, the pen instead.
B00MEHBIF8|5|Fits my 2015 Honda Fit EX like a glove! Quality part.... Direct bolt on with No cutting or fab required.
B00HSFAR0S|1|Someone at Bosch Filters screwed up the application guide.  The P3911WS does NOT fit the 2013 Santa Fe.  It is almost twice the thickness.  Everyone is listing it incorrectly.
B000Q0M19W|5|This part worked perfectly on my 98 xj Cherokee. Now my window rolls up great
B00S4J0HFC|5|When I first saw it l didn't think it would be any good, boy was l wrong ! I liked it so much I'm going to order another one
B003KKJ7PG|5|Good value and nice loud sound.
B0035QZ12I|5|excelente
B00UTD76GY|5|Installed very easily. A lot better than the removal of the old ones. This was in my 98 xj cherokee
B000C19DGY|5|Works as I expected I would recommend to a friend.
B0068C05D6|5|Good OEM replacement for much less money
B000B9181A|5|Glad I was able to find this. Exact replacement for the factory unit that needed replacement on my boat.
B002L7C3IC|5|I love it!!!! It makes our 2000 chevy silverado 1500 look so good. It fits perfectly an very easy to install we put a clear coat over the bowtie to keep it from chipping. An I highly recommend doing.
B00G7ROWEA|5|love it!
B00029J3U2|5|Just what I was looking for, keeps my motor cool on my '84 Cutlass SBC 350  no problem . Great buy Happy Customer
B001AJH1HK|5|Given to father in law. Fits perfect on his truck. So they can pull the trailer. Second ones they tried.
B00F4MQJ5O|5|I have had this light for about a year or so now. It has yet to fail on me. Super bright, doesn't leak and haven't heard the infamous whistle. I had to build my own metal brackets (which was a bear of a task) but that's because I have a T-100. I have it mounted above my windshield. I will say...if you mount this above your windshield...be sure to add some form of fabric or another &#34;matte&#34; finished product to your dash. The sheen from the dash will reflect to your windshield, which will make it hard to see. But that being said I LOVE THIS LIGHT BAR! I get 3-5 comments about it a week. I would definitely buy this product again!
B00BHD3WHC|5|A gift - which they really liked
B001W8CS36|4|I can't speak to the longevity, but I got this in yesterday for my 2015 Indian Scout, and it fits like a glove. A word of caution; it can be snug when first putting it on and taking it off, so be careful around your turn signals if they stick out.
B00QVMZNZS|1|Save your money or buy the one with a slit on the side
B00F7NEREU|3|the threads are falling apart from side...
B000BEZNSO|5|Whoever invented this is my hero. It allows you to have water access outside the camper for filling buckets and pails without disconnecting your water or having to use the outside shower
B00YEENLRC|5|Nice thick chrome, bolted up like it should.
B00G24F3J6|4|Are nice, afraid they'll be stolen. The locking ones are great, but then a PIA, when I need a quick top-off of air, and then need special allan to remove.<br />But is nice. And little wrench keyring, like you need that to just twist off
B00CXB84N4|5|Works fantastic
B000A0EJD4|4|setup is easily.
B00FEMK5FO|5|Awesome
B004A6JA2O|5|Easy to install. No odd smells. Don't pay the dealership $60+ to change this for you! It took my husband less than 5 minutes. So far, so good on quality product.
B011Q18D14|5|I have a 2008 Yukon and they are known to have the engine light on for the smallest things, so this comes in so handy! I tested it and it is reading the same code has Auto Zone. It is so easy to use and read what the codes mean.
B007IBEDTS|5|Perfect fit and cheaper this getting it done at the dealer
B000BPZ306|5|I purchased two of these to dry my dogs after their baths. They are so much easier to use than bath towels. It only takes one to dry each dog instead of two regular size towels. I love the fact that I can squeeze the water out and use it again and again until the dog is dry. I then rinse each one in warm water, ring it out again and store. My husband couldn't believe that something stored damp wouldn't attract mold and mildew, but they don't. I just wish they made them in a larger size.
B000C9L4HM|5|Be better if it came with corona!!
B000QIH3C4|5|Worked well in my 2001 Buick Regal...<br />There was a slow coolant leak coming out of some little place where I, as a car illiterate girl, cannot remember the name of.<br />I crushed up two of these and put it in the hole thingy where the coolant goes (technical term), and the leak stopped.<br />So... voila!<br />And I was told by some people this would be fine and safe... and told by others it could mess things up... And when I consulted the interwebs I found conflicting advice there too.<br />But my car is already a piece of junk --so caution to the wind, I used these.<br />And they worked. And I am happy. :)
B00FWPL5MK|5|just what i ordered good part fit good
B0008FUHWI|5|Works every time!!!
B0046I9FSU|1|It doesn't work
B00U868BN4|1|Poor made from cheap crap
B008FCD8DG|5|Fit perfect easy to put on works good.
B00PGFN3GC|5|Love this helmet
B00BGH2MGG|5|All great...hope to purchase tattoo KD sunglasses through Amazon.
B0082CTSOM|2|Beautiful part but does not work with oem s4 avus wheels. The clip is to shallow so it does not allow to clip into the center. These are great after market s4 wheels but not original equipment
B00AC6VPY2|1|It said straps as in plural. Only one came. Rip off.
B00WHW227I|2|Item was to large.It needed to be modified
B00252JBMY|5|Perfect fit and easy  to install
B0015PG5IU|5|Perfect product for the job needed
B009G4OR9Q|5|Comfortable on a long ride... Recommend helmet...
B002QMV70M|5|Great low-profile, lightweight kit.  Well worth the cost.
B0013RIOMK|5|Easy to  install, great look
B00FXYG39U|5|Vvivid vinyl has always done pretty well for me. Good price.
B00BLZ6XF4|5|product received as advertised and in good order
B008I7OZN0|5|Great it fit perfectly.
B00TX5SAU0|5|:)
B008E6CVCC|5|nice looking and a good weight
B000HACYNY|4|Works as expected, but awfully large.
B002UGX0ZY|2|The quality is not good even the turbo blanket
B009OOT1EY|5|Fit perfect-saved the day.
B00EA0ZB7I|4|Just what was needed.
B00B8X3J42|5|Excellent kit at a great price.  Installed easily.  Only question was the directions say to put the factory spring isolators on the top of the spacer, between the spacer and the coil bucket.  All other info I found on videos and instructions for other brands says to pull the isolators off and put them on the bottom of the spacers, between the coil spring and the spacer.  Don't know if it makes a difference or not, but I put my isolators on TOP of the springs like the directions say.  Rides just like stock and initially got 2&#34; at each corner.  It settled some after a couple of days.  No steering wheel adjustment required.  Very happy with the product!
B001G5QVOW|5|original specs worked as expected
B00MOZI9I4|5|Awesome performance great product for the serious racer !!
B00GUVG6TC|2|Very small
B000AMPJMW|5|Love it! It is solid and good quality!
B00MOU4X9I|4|Beautiful clip. My only suggestion for improvement is that the visor clips itself needs to be a little thicker to accomodate the visors of newer cars which are made of much thicker materials.
B004X96DPA|1|not easy to use
B00E5OUOCQ|4|I ordered this sunshade for my 2012 Toyota 4Runner and the shade is a little big for the windshield. It still works fine as the wire frame bends pretty easily yet still holds it's shape. I saw some of the other reviews that gave negative marks for the shade being difficult to fold up for storage but it's easy once you get the hang of it. There are numerous videos on YouTube that show the trick to folding it and make it really easy. Hard to beat for the price and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a car shade. I think it should fit almost any car, truck or SUV windshield.
B000CNL9X2|2|too expensive
B00859HI12|5|A must have if you carry items in your trunk.
B0048GH1FE|5|I was satisfied with the number of clamps and the price.
B0024B1A3Y|5|So far so good, and at a fraction of the cost of my local ARS.  Read the instructions, my compressor came pre-filled with oil.  This is the 3rd compressor for my 2005 Sienna, currently I have 190K miles on the van.  Very happy to be back to OEM, which has performed flawlessly and quietly like when I bought the van new.  Recently we have been in 95-100 degree weather range and high humidity.  The 2nd compressor I had installed was non-OEM and I was disappointed when I found my local repair shop had put in a louder and noticeably inferior brand.  They also added too much oil (at their own admission after I returned it non-working) and did not have the rear A/C running when charging the system.  This in turn caused the compressor to go into a high pressure state rather quickly when the rear A/C was turned on.  The clutch on that one gave out so it was a good excuse for me to get the OEM back on, especially at only $230!!!
B000S2IZ6G|5|Easy to install
B00AHIYMHC|2|did not fit
B00CYLETLY|4|The bolt covers are hard to put on/stay on, so I glued mine.  But they look great and everyone comments on them!
B00BITJE4K|4|It LOOKS cheap, not as substantial as the oe. BUT! At 11 bucks, I'll live with it as long ass it opens the door. If it lasts 2 years, I'll consider that a success. It fit very well and the door opens. 90 4Runner
B00K36BUGO|5|The M4 sounds great and fits perfect also like how it hides the O2 sensor. Total install time under 45 minutes. I called the company to make sure the it was the right product, do the instructions stating 2014. She ensured me the directions weren't updated for the 2015.
B009XTZ0XQ|5|Why do these expire? They ain't cheap but its for safety i ts not worth a life but good unit and very sensitive
B00199N4CW|5|Bought these for my '07 Silverado 1500 along with OEM AC Delco pads to replace &#34;premium&#34; pads and rotors purchased from NAPA that were the dirtiest brakes I've ever dealt with insofar as dusting off.  I replaced the NAPA junk with these rotors along with the OEM AC Delco pads #171-0974. Perfect fit and very well balanced. These OEM rotors are manufactured by Bosch. Minor dusting for the first day as the protective coating was rubbed off by the brake pads (they caution you NOT to remove the coating, indicating that the pads will do so). Since then the wheels stay clean and the brakes are very effective.  Very satisfied.
B00BX8T7ZC|5|I am really pleased with this product.  I previously had the same style of cover from Lund but with the high gloss material.  This premium material is holding up very well and won't be as brittle in the winter months.
B00BYH6C1E|3|It's a little short for the front of my seats in my 2012 Hyundai Sonata. I wish it was two inches longer. Other than that, it is ok.
B0002Z9N1K|1|I purchased this December 2014, it is now August 2015, and the color of the finish has yellowed.  The first 3 inches in from the tip end, it has a rust color which looks terrible.  This must not be a quality product.  Looks great new, 8 months later looks worse than the exhaust pipe I installed it on.
B00H1I5UCW|3|Bought these to replace original lug nuts that came with aftermarket wheels (originals lasted about 4 years before becoming rusty).  These DP nuts lasted about 2 years before they got rusty. Can't seem to find ones that are any better so I bought the exact same ones again since they were pretty cheap. I guess I can just replace them every couple of years or just put up with them once they eventualy get rusty.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Very decent cord came sooner than expected very satisfied with purchase
B00JMUKIHO|5|Works amazing! Looks great! Seller was very prompt in delivery!
B00FXLRIJC|5|Very easy to install, didn't come with instructions so here it is. To remove the old one, pull it out straight out. It may be a bit hard, but it will come out. Insert new one, align it then tighten down the bolt.
B00CEXK9FM|5|Installed on 2015 GMC crew. The low profile design looks much nicer than other sets I've had. Made in USA.
B000C7YRWI|5|Got here faster than a thought... A+
B00QU70X7M|5|Item works as expected.  Light is perfect and fan works great.  Love the idea of being able to plug it into the light on the camper.  Also love the idea that we can finally use the plugs for something!!
B00VVFIWDU|5|Great!  Was exactly the same as the original, bolted and pluuged right into place.
B0006I0MV8|5|Great price. They matched up perfectly.
B00KWDR8OG|4|Great fit for my lexus is 300
B001THWFII|2|it's hard to get the wax off otherwise it's ok....
B00OC5CXMW|5|Love this sterling wheel cover.  I have not had any slipping problems like some reviewers wrote.  I have a Honda Civic and it slipped on fairly easy (I am older and not as strong as I used to be, but I got it on.)  The cover looks great, vibrant colors, great graphics, and the cotton fabric feels wonderful, especially when getting into a hot car in the Texas heat.  Item was exactly as described. Fast shipping. Great seller.
B00K53BM0E|3|The battery was the correct size and came in great condition. However, the top posts (cages) where not straight.  They weren't bent just attached at a an angle from the factory.  In most cases this wouldn't be an issue, but I was putting this in a Honda 600 VLX motorcycle.  The battery on these things is in the worst possible place in side the frame and access to the posts is very limited.  I had a very difficult time trying to get the screws to screw into the lugs in the cage at the angle the they were at.  So not very impressed with that.  And the battery was supposed to come with at least a partial charge, but mine was completely dead.  Not a problem, just not what was advertised.
B00UN4HMQ8|5|Fits great and looks good
B00XS04T8S|5|I loved these. They are pretty cool and make my Lancer look sweet! Not too hard to install plus they work like seatbelts just better!
B00IX5MOD0|5|I loved it. You can put it in yourself and it's pretty easy to do. Good piece if you wanna stand out when it's late in the evening.
B00NQD21AK|5|Looked all over for this. Thanks hope I don't have to use it.
B004Y8LB7K|5|Fits perfectly! Money well spent 😀
B009KA2DPQ|5|everything that I expected
B000I8YPX2|3|It works, but not really sure how you get it on the cord. I ended up using a zip tie to hold the tether to the cord
B001UCCN52|5|Good material arrive very fast to Germany
B00LDR8UBK|5|Worked great
B0002SRG4S|5|Great tool at a good price
B002FAFNRI|5|Worked
B00YWDU0WE|5|Looks and fits well in my '02 Honda Civic.
B00FMWUZOW|4|Worked like a charm
B000EOMZOQ|5|I put this on my 2013 Honda Ridgeline. Although putting it together using the directions it didn't seem or look like what I expected, in the end it was perfect. I'm 100% satisfied. Fast service no complaints, thanks.
B00JYX5WFW|5|Great product! Got it in two days!! Thank you!
B008Y8WPUS|5|Parts were exactly what I needed for my 2009 Cadillac Escalade with tan interior.
B00NUOTEMI|1|did not work at all, I would give it no stars i
B007EA6PS0|5|Excellent.  Solid and stable.  Convenient.  The straps that hold the bikes on the rack are easy to use and very effective.  It is easy both to lock the rack to the car with a short cable lock (not included) and to lock your bikes to the rack using a cable lock and connecting it to the mounting loop on the back of the vertical main bar.  The fold down and tilt features worked effectively.  Some other brands have similar models with push buttons for the fold down and tilt features which might be more convenient but they were over twice the price of this one and if the push buttons ever fail the rack is shot.  This one might take a few more seconds but I can't imagine the simple, straightforward mechanisms having any problems.  This rack should last forever and at half the price.
B007ZDFU4Q|5|Looks great on my MKX!
B010SH8OFW|5|I get sore elbow from driving so much ... This little pad helped alot
B002JH4GMK|2|Doesn't stay stuck
B00027H2O8|5|Yearly maintenance and this fit the bill.
B00XO6BW40|4|Tool appears to be in good order and good value for money
B007HRXKP6|5|really made a big difference on our motorhome
B003ZWG6T4|5|Great fit and price!
B00V84CWYY|5|Aside from my biased support for Ted, the product itself is great!
B009LRUCSI|4|They worked as advertised, plenty of pressure to lift rear door.  These are heavy doors, made of steel, not plastic as someone else wrote
B0012TT9VE|5|Worked as needed!!
B00KCQSIRY|1|Did not fit my vehicle like they said it would.
B008K5GB0A|5|Just took this to Sturgis and it was perfect for size and functionality. I really appreciate the reflective piping on the back as I rode home at night.
B004K7ZD56|4|This is a good product at a good price.  I have more than 3000 miles on these shocks and they are performing as expected.  The car gives a smooth quiet ride.  Good quality.
B002EBSLA4|5|I have always loved Bosch products. They seem to care about detail. Their windshield wipers are top notch so are their oil filters. They are solid and made well. I typically change my oil every 12,000 miles with synthetic and feel very confident that these filters can handle that. Worth the little extra.
B000AXWK1Y|5|This gift was perfect on so many levels.  A Father's Day Gift for my husband from the two youngest grandchildren.  The price was fantastic.  The quality of the sign exceeded my expectations and it arrived faster than I had expected it to as well.  My husband was truly happy with it!!
B007AOQU5I|5|Works great a lot cheaper than other brands doesnt shift
B000GROI28|5|The plush lining provides much better protection to your helmet than the  other bags available at this price range . SUPER DEAL!!!
B00VH643H2|5|I am always in need of more towels.  Somehow they just keep disappearing out of my closet.  I am really unsure why this happens but it does.  These are made very well and seem to be able to stand up to any mess.  I used them to clean up my dogs constant need to not finish drinking the water he is drinking and let it pour out of his mouth.  I also used them to wipe down my car and it left no streaks on the windows.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to a good towel.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review.
B0073MFM4M|5|Radiator is working fine so far.
B000PWW5DI|1|First let me start by saying the positive - AMAZON stood up and took care of the problem.  As to the product - these are absolute GARBAGE.  I bought a set of 8, out of the 8 2 failed right out of the box! Thats a 25% failure rate.  I contacted Autolite, and explained my method of diagnosis, and the tech agreed with he that the plugs are BAD, but they then want you to send them back to be analyzed for 2 to 3 weeks.  The ones that failed would throw misfire codes right away, and one upon removing it the porcelain is actually loose.  Like I said AMAZON stepped up, but Autolite, is making JUNK so Buyer beware.
B00KIZ0VOC|5|The key was exactly as described. It even came in a factory TOYOTA sealed package.
B000BKC24G|5|looks great - very good price - BTW - it is a vented cap
B000BUQOEK|5|Great
B005F0WXRS|4|Smells great; wish I had known Walmart Carries this product though lol
B006DX6OKS|5|Just the right part,  It was a simple easy fix!
B00FTB4PCE|5|Watched a YouTube video for instructions. Installed in less than ten minutes.
B006QGD996|5|Perfect for our moving truck!  Speedy delivery.  Thanks!
B00DZXMURU|3|We reivedthese but were labled DC.  Misrepresented as AC.  You can see the pulsating light.  Ok. bulbs but would like to see better representation of what is actually being represented.  As an electrician, I was able to overcome this, but due to the misrepresentation, it causes a lot more work on my part.
B0027UTJHQ|5|Excelent
B005GBS07I|4|Looks great on my car window!
B004QEM7HK|5|excellent, prompt
B00WOT3YM6|4|Just the idea that the exact amount of air would reach each individual tire was enough to sell me.  I'm seventy eight years of age and stooping for even short amount of times can be painful --great idea!  , That is the best part about America, people with great ideas.and that is why we are the greatest country in the world.
B0024ECIP0|5|Great cord for a great price.
B00HQYTUYA|5|These are fantastic.  I'm in my car a lot and the seatbelt was  so annoying, cutting into my shoulder etc.  I was always moving it up -  down and now with these awesome sheepskin covers - comfortable at last!  Great price for such a big difference in my driving comfort.  Thank you.
B00ZBC9BW0|5|Best lights on the road do not burn out and bright
B001810SHA|5|I had tried to fix my daily driver's A/C but I did not succeed. With this product I found the leak right away, lucky me the system was only leaking freon from the service port. 60 cents later and 2 fresh service port caps and A/C blows cold a month later when it would only blow cold for a week before. And for exactly $39.10 my 2.2 miles daily commute is much comfortable.
B006U604OA|3|well after a while it turns yellow.  I have since thrown it away, but the idea is nice and works great until then.
B006QZLL7O|5|Improved the throttle response<br />Got rid of the back fire<br />Smoothed out the engine<br />And then there's the power increase that is very noticable<br />The new K&N high flow intakes the cobra straight pipes and the new jet kit work perfect together.<br />600$ well spent<br />The directions are extremely easy to follow. A 12 year old could re jet his bike with this kit.
B001U8MPMM|2|Material was very cheap. Ripped in a few places while I was installing. No slots for the seat belts. Moved all over the place once installed.
B000EG6CS4|5|I used DuraLube in a ceased 1/2 HP central AC fan motor.  Eyedropper full of this product in each bearing cup.  30 year old motor that was ceased now works perfectly,  lower amp draw also now, indicates that it is less friction.  My father swore bu DuraLube since his 1990 Chevrolet Corsica hit the 200,000 mile mark with no issues with the engine.  I am a beleiver!
B00KTIQG2Y|5|Works Great.
B009XDDRDC|5|Great!!!
B00UJDNNPC|2|Does not fit the 01 sport trac. The base isn't long enough and the notches don't line up
B00NF0KIOA|5|Directional (must be inserted right way round).<br /><br />How much light is enough? Well these units are marginally brighter than stock and much cooler operating. So they aren't going to light the night sky but are fine for finding items that have migrated to the floor. The temperature of the light? Cool, almost neon cool.<br /><br />Otherwise these lights are unremarkable. I bought two and both worked perfectly. Although directional I noted these devices do not appear to be hurt by accidentally inserting them backwards.
B002R0L3O8|5|I am very satisfied my order came very fast. The quality is great and very easy to install.
B00OFU33PU|3|Working out great!
B00VN0PSBW|5|Cap is GREAT!
B00EC2CCZ8|5|What's nice about these straps is being able to permanently mount them on my trailer. They are set up under my rain cover ready for anything that needs lashing down. Then they retract nice and neat. Highly recommended.
B008G4Y076|1|While I saw these noted as a great replacements for your reverse lights. These suuuuuucccckkkkk for reverse lights. The stock incandescent bulbs do a better job. These don't even come close to improving, its a step down from an incandescent bulb. Maybe as a running light they'd be fine but their terrible for anything else.
B001FKEMGM|5|fits and works great.  spacer / bushing which comes with it allows for a standard bearing to be used for next service.
B00BITKJNK|5|fits and works
B00LBL2LFE|2|Cheap. Hoses do not fit the threaded connectors below the gages, Seem to fit threads on back (not visible in pix).  They opened the mfr. bag and dropped parts int UPS bag. A cardboard STARK brand label was included, but no instructions.  Nothing firs the connectors on my 93 frod 150, which are R-12, as the kit advertises it is good for.  (marking are on gauges, but hoses don't fit and no adaptes to R-012 threads on truck.
B00HLV8VLQ|5|A fun addition to my back window
B010CQNIIW|5|Thank you very much..
B000KZ2166|5|Works perfectly.
B00NLR1666|5|Great helmet! Very comfortable! It is almost a little too big, I probably could have done an XS but it definitely works well enough to cruise around!
B003L31RK0|5|Product as described, solid constraction, I run fully synthetic oil for 7-8k mi & this filter seems to do a great job, I'm a repeat customer & very pleased with its performance, it is worth to pay $2-$3 more on quality product, I used to buy fram but not anymore. Also thanx for fast delivery
B000VKRQ7O|1|BUYER BEWARE!!  THIS DOES NOT FIT A 2012 SONATA!  ONLINE DIMENSIONS ARE WRONG.  IT IS NOT 10X9X1.  THE ACTUAL DIMENSIONS ARE:  8X9X1.  AVOID THE AGGRAVATION OF RETURNING IT.  BUY THE AUTHENTIC HYUNDAI ONE.  IT'S WORTH<br />THE FEW EXTRA DOLLARS.
B007V2DSAY|4|Fit and finish material of the heat shield is very good and gaps are minimal.  Material seems to be holding up well, even under our 100+ degree summer heat.  The shield is in constant used and time will tell if the hinged sections hold up to the constant install/remove cycles that it is subjected to.  Inside truck surfaces are noticeably cooler with the heat shield in place, which will certainly prolong the life of my dash and electronics.  I would definitely recommend this product, as it is much superior to some of the &#34;metallic&#34; shields that I have used in the past.
B00L6RE5N4|5|Product came before scheduled date to be delivered.  Easy install to vehicle.  Everything works as stated.  Only down fall is that I don't have any lights when I put it on High-Beam.  Didn't know I could order a bi-Xenon Bulb for an extra price.
B00029WRM8|2|One of the mirrors cracked when adjusting.
B00H554R98|5|Does what it says.
B005IZ29HY|4|I installed these myself and they work fine. I have a lowrider and they still do the job. Just know that the front will drop slightly lower with this brand but there is nothing on the market to compare price wise!
B00HFHMUAO|5|perfect!!!! put them on my raider drag bars and they look great..i get asked daily where I got them
B00I3N86HK|5|Quality project does the job well
B004GDXZZY|1|This product does not come anywhere close to matching the replacement part for a 2003 Dodge Ram 3500 bumper bracket.
B0002SRCMO|5|Does what it's designed to do.
B00BTIN7SO|2|Seat is comfortable but the backrest is too far back to do any good for me. I am 5'10&#34; and weight 170 lbs. Seat probably good for much larger person. Bicycle seat would be much better if backrest could be adjusted to move forward or backwards.
B00DQJ7UZ0|5|Attanna looks good, works ok,some stations I did loose with it, but I bought it for the looks so it's fine with me.
B004RNSLYS|5|great oil
B0012KGXKI|4|I found this to be a great decal for a plain 8 oz flask. It is beautiful and doesn't have any pixelation in the image. I do wish that there wasn't the unattractive clear edge around the actual image, but that was easily fixed with a pair of scissors.
B010E599QQ|3|Sticker application was extremely difficult and the backing tore.
B0042TQM3O|5|Very good. And it takes away the scratches and swirls all out. Recommended highly. Thanks chemical guys. Keep my car looking new and scratch less. A highly recommended product
B00AESXU0A|5|This is a great sticker for showing your friends you don't think much of what your husband does for a living. It's not easy falling back asleep after he gets up at 0530 for pt. Let's not forget the traffic while dropping the kids off at daycare. I would also like to see a soldier who can unlock their car while carrying two full starbucks Frappuccino's. Definitely the hardest job and you deserve it!<br /><br />These are good quality stickers however and won't leave a mark on your car like some cheaper ones might.
B000P0VT3C|4|Works as advertised
B0060WJ5K8|5|As expected.
B007X48RV0|1|Liked the lashes but they did not fit my golf cart😤
B0001EW4AY|4|Very nice vent shades, mine are on a 2004 Toyota Sequoia. The dark tint blends very well with the black paint of the vehicle.<br />They were easy to install and based on past experience I expect the 3M tape to keep them in place for at least 5 years, though I don't use automatic car washes too much, I prefer to wash my own.<br />The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 was the generic instructions. There should have been an added instruction for the rear Sequoia windows, the shade needs to be placed slightly higher to get the best fit, it is too long to place right at the edge of the trim closest to the window, needs to be moved up 1/4&#34;, then it fits perfectly. This is due to the ange at the rear or the back passenger windows.<br />Being able to have the windows open some while at work makes a big difference in the temperature in the vehicle, I can feel the difference.
B00QMWQSAG|4|Perfect for my needs. Heavy duty.
B000B8WMAW|5|Yes, love it !!!'
B00WMQPP4G|4|This replaced a &#34;hockey puck&#34; cable guard that was on my Polaris Ranger winch for a couple of years.  It cracked at the screws.  So far it's working great and keeps the hook from making noise in the fair head.  Gave it 4 stars because the cable hole is large and I had to put some heat shrink tube over my synthetic cable to prevent slipping.  Want it to stay right behind the hook.  Could easily have been designed with a smaller hole and end user could bore it out to fit steel cable.  Easier to bore out than fill in.  Couldn't beat the Amazon price!
B001QIXDNG|5|Works really well 😁
B002QVLOTM|5|I installed it in a 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe and it works great. IT IS VERY VERY VERY QUIET, without any clutch noise in the cabin what so ever.<br /><br />Label says Made in Mexico, which is rare because nowadays almost all other AC compressors are made outside the American Continent.<br /><br />Compressor came DRY and without oil. It has a label stating that compressor requires PAG150. Watch out for this because for Chevy there are a number of recent TSB's that state to use PAG46, which apparently DOESN'T APPLY for THIS older OEM compressor.<br /><br />Also (depending on your vehicle and requirement) consider ordering a new pressure switch, which is located in the back of the compressor as this new compressor does not include that switch.<br /><br />When you transfer the switch you will need a new o-ring.
B0006HNBZ8|5|perfect chrome looks great
B00GWF4CYW|5|I love them...
B00B7SL73I|5|Exactly what I need. OEM part. Looks just like the original. Installed it in less than 15 minutes with nothing more than a philips screw driver.
B00NLMDWRW|5|The one I got has no mirror slots but that's perfect because I have aftermarket mirriors fits great no issues plenty big
B009XAQZY8|1|Exactly.I returned it because it sald N. or NW no matter what direction I was going. Wonder if it has to do with the placement of its battery.
B00C6MWBK2|4|Part
B005LW5OQM|3|These fit great and looked awesome, but were not that durable. After only a week of use, my middle finger burst right through the end. I wasn't even doing anything that strenuous. They definitely need to be reinforced in the fingertip area.
B000IZ4B7K|5|Was easy to install and works great ALOT cheaper than having someone else install it
B000BWAP4I|4|Got this but didn't use it; still it looks like the best choice out of many - and it looks good on the shop wall :)
B00F89VJ1C|2|The sticker is very bad and it is coming off as paper while sticking it. So i removed the sticker part for this trim and used the 3M sticker.
B009S1DJSW|5|Worked great! Fit existing receptacle nicely, for such a small lamp puts out quite copious light.
B004TRKBOK|5|Came as promised. Great price for a tool that I hope I never have to use
B00EVXGVY6|5|Just what I needed.
B000HEBR3I|4|Works good for small jobs of transferring water.
B00SKUYSPA|5|I got this for my husband for our pontoon boat, it says motorcycle but I figured it would work well on the boat since it's waterproof!!!  We didn't need the handlebar attachment and it was super easy to install!  You cannot put a cigarette lighter in the actual port per the instructions but allows us to charge 3 things from one location which is a great plus!!  Although I received this item for free or at a discount for an honest unbiased review this doesn't change my opinion of the product!
B0001XPC7C|4|keeps my car change organized. very useful
B004D92S9K|5|Outstanding! Just as the sticker says, it's shiny! Not like mirror shiny though, so don't expect to be able to use it to put make-up on, but it is the *exact* level of shiny-ness that you would expect from a vinyl sticker.<br />Just to be certain that I could recommend it to you with confidence, however, I *did* take it to the lab to get their opinion, and they ran it through their shineoyancy machine. After about an hour of beeps & hums & something that sounded like 3 magpies holding a conversation, the sticker gently exited the other end of the strange contraption (one of only 3 in the world, I've heard) and the test results came in: 99.8% shininess!<br />The lab tech said that it's usually only NASA &  another company in the North Pole He couldn't disclose the name) that reaches that level of perfection.<br /><br />So, yes - it's VERY worthy of any Browncoat - or even justyour average rootless 'Verse nomad.<br /><br />OH, and on top of all that, it came 1 day EARLIER than the estimated delivery time.<br /><br />Shiny!
B00JVLP8RE|5|Very Nice
B0002JMEQW|5|Received a very well made product. Looking forward to it's 1st use.
B000EDSSKW|5|These step covers really helped keep our camper clean from tracked in dirt.  Everyone camping with us noticed the obvious benefit.<br />There are two little hooks on each one.  They come off too easily.... but no problem.... we simply took pliers and &#34;squished&#34; one hook on each side together, stretched the other end to the desired fit.  This also helps them remain on the cover when packed so they do not get separated from the cover itself.
B008DNC7KW|5|Nice high quality frame
B00AEAXTZ4|5|It fit my husband perfect. Nice quality.
B00HQLD7KG|5|Looks great
B00480BWCI|5|Bought 2 packs for my rv. I use to carry half a lumber yard of boards before.  This is better and lighter
B00KCMQW3A|5|Just what I expected
B004GCCDO4|5|Fast shipping fit just right
B000BQW5LK|4|It doesn't pump the fluid as fast as I thought it would but it does the job it was made to do.
B0002NUO6K|4|Product arrived quickly and was as described. But requires a lot more scrubbing than expected.
B000CNN32W|4|Got this to replace Ford Ranger fan. Pulls a lot of air. Quality is very good. Looks great. Installs very easily. Only issues: very noisy and recommend you look at the main Flex-a-lite website to make sure you are getting all the adapters you need.
B00DGVRXD2|5|They turn your regular fuel container into a super container!!!!
B003G0KO6G|5|This fits the back of my 2015 Toyota 4Runner SR5 perfectly.
B004FHD5AQ|5|I love it!! All you do is flip it down & then flip it up. It couldn't be easier.
B000C3ZDV6|5|Love the aisstance they add to my rear end keeping everything planted
B008HQ2AAW|4|These do a pretty decent job of isolating the vibrations from an oxygen generator on the 2nd floor of the house. You can still hear/feel the thing, but nearly so badly as before. These are on hardwood. If these were on something like a laminate floor that had a bit of its own dampening, I'll bet you wouldn't hear anything at all down below.
B001GIG78E|5|Thanks You!!!
B00DI3DV6G|4|Lil flimsy but worth the price
B001C6P0NS|5|This is a must when changing water pump! The design is great will not loose bolts down in engine!
B004J0P7T6|5|good
B000B66KFC|5|It's the Buckeyes what more can I say
B003UWY4C0|5|Good shine
B00F3M2SFK|5|This decal looks wonderful on the back of my car!
B00KY0HGI0|5|good
B000CO76EW|5|Just like factory.
B0008D6NK0|4|Replaced an old laser sensor, appears to be bright and goo motion sensing.
B00CSBOFGO|5|Worked well
B004F7JD5M|5|This stuff is horrible and I love it. Just be careful you could have a huge mess on your hands if your not. I removed squeaks from floorboards that I had no underside access to.
B00CAY4TSI|5|Priced one at DR it was twice the price.  Was on time and worked perfectly.
B002R0LFS2|5|Fit/match exactly correct.
B008GGDD2W|4|great
B00KTJ3ZMW|4|Save me lots of money.
B000NF1VBE|5|Worked great - in an hour I had fixed my minor scratch
B00GBSWWHE|5|welded these to my 75 scout II .Now the mufflers no longer bang on the drive shaft . Just like the bigger brothers they have great sound and quality
B007KPV4VW|1|Bag mount doesn't work so had to improvise
B00BITQIEY|5|I needed to replace a driver side door handle for 2008 Chrysler Sebring. The part I ordered was exactly what I needed and fit perfectly. When you try to replace this part yourself it requires the removal of the driver side window it is pretty labor-intensive to do this. You need to remove the window so that you can remove the plastic door cover so you can get at the linkage as well as the screws on the underside of the doorhandle.  Once I was able to get the window out the rest of the repair went smoothly
B00HWYPQME|5|Love it!
B00XCZVXCO|1|Ordered 5 kits for Banshee's for dune fest.  Install was ok, much brighter than stock.  First 5 min of riding, one light smoked and was unplugged, 3 others all lights quit working.  One Banshee started working for a short time.  Only one Banshee had working lights on our trip.  I would not recommend this on a Banshee.
B000RQT8V4|5|Looks cool, better quality than the oem cap. I recommend
B0073Q48TI|5|Man these are the ones!!!  work fine!
B00EZUL6ZY|3|Good mats, but seem to be suited for compact....maybe mid-size vehicles or a mini-SUV.
B010OASNHC|1|Very upset.  Received the sticker and its not the sized the posting displayed. Its 1inch x 6 inches...not large enough to put on my windshield, that's for sure!!
B001RGAPFG|2|One reviewer said the white matched the plastics on his 2014 DRZ400SM, however I had a completely different experience. The white fender that I received was totally off in color. That makes it garbage unless it is repsrayed properly.<br /><br />This may all depend on the seller of the fender as I find it hard to believe one would match perfectly and the other look horrible.
B00RR247BM|5|Looks really great on my vehicle! Easy to work with.
B00OP97Z6E|4|The colors are beautiful and the sticker is a thick plastic.  I am not really fond of the opaque white outline as it is a bit wide and distracts from the overall design.
B0048EBJJ0|5|Good fit and quality
B00GB9SNTE|5|I never understood why people pay for the HIGH END bars when this (so far) holds up just as well
B001GJ3FIS|3|This is an ok product. It has hardly any pressure, but it does the job.
B000ALDQXC|1|You only get one lift support, but they use the term 'Pack' in the description.  A 'Pack' is a group of things (more than 1) and should not be used in the description.
B00U5HVW50|5|Great product and better customer service!
B000AAM2Z6|5|works good
B00PXMB4JG|1|This does not work on my 2012 Dodge Journey as advertised.  It also doesn't come with any instructions and is very oddly shaped.  This is just piled in a ball in my trunk and is completely worthless to me.  Wish I would not have wasted money on it.
B00IJEV66G|5|Received my License Plate Frame in record time!  I chose the Black versus the Chrome as my car is white and it pops off the white!  It not only looks great but was super easy to Install.  I highly recommend this to anyone!
B00M3FRNMS|5|Much more vibrant in place.<br />This decal actually looks like the picture when received -- but when you put it on your car, the colors suddenly pop.
B001GRWBGC|5|Very nice and they fit well. Also easy to install.
B00FMUYYT6|5|Great product. Easy to install
B00HZ870GM|4|Much smaller than the older unites and easier to use.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Great - thanks..
B001DRFJUK|3|Would have been great if it fit
B005VYN3JA|3|OKAY ITEM NOT MUCH TO BRAG ABOUT, THEY LIGHT UP.
B009EVOVCO|5|8/8/2015 (Maryland resident) Yes, this is an expensive top... But you get what you pay for! Word of advice... Put all of your hardware on 1st, then all of your &#34;Bows&#34;, then the twill top, then the windows. The instructions need re-work, but are a good reference, unless you kinda know how everything goes already by googling the instructions. Please use a Eletrical screwdriver/drill with a #2 Philips bit (This will help go much faster...). The quality is A++ and the fit is not only more snugged, but is really tight to the Specifications to the TJ (no gaps at all, no rubbing at the front bottom corner were the door jam is at for the windows, or between the rear sails at the back window and side windows, also at the top were the windshield is. The front rain gutters are MUCH easier to take off when you just want to flip the front off, or fold down/take off the whole thing).<br /><br />I had an 8 year old Bestop black diamond replacement top, on my 98 Wrangler (back window snapped at 0° weather in January of 2015 and the layer of black diamond splits at all the seams/stitches and pealed back, like it was a perforated paper towel in 15+ places and leaked at the windshield top corners, also the layers a over the driver and front passenger were separating like the old car head liners).<br /><br />I had the new twill top for 5 days now and it gives my Jeep that new car smell... Never going back to denim or black diamond again! I'm glad I did my homework (not many reviews on this top I guess because of the price. I talked to JK owners about their stock twill tops (also made by Bestop, and I also got to see them and inspect them up close (even though I have a TJ, and not a JK)<br /><br />My back window was scratched because of loose bows during shipping and storage? I'm in talks with Bestop now to see what they can do ;-)
B00F8FVOB6|2|Their advertising says front shoes will fit on 1999 Kawasaki Bayou 220, but they are smaller than the old ones I'm trying to replace and hence cannot touch the drum even when fully extended. I'd do fewer stars, but the price is great and they look fine.  Maybe they'd fit other machines?
B008WH4XAQ|5|Worked exactly as described.
B000C9HMN2|3|why does it look like only two shoe hold down springs. blue are for equalizer bar, green is for self adjuster lever???
B00S75A5IW|1|Had to be replaced after two weeks then new ones only lasted a month after that. I do not recommend
B001VXXUWK|5|This faceshield is so comfortable, and the lens so clear, that I often have to doublecheck and make sure I am wearing it.  Awesome product.
B00TQ4HNOM|5|Hi to all I must say I'm impress with these muffler tips when they arrived fully wrapped up and secured and reached before it's time!!! I recommend this to anyone who wants that /////AMG  aggressive  look on the back of their  mercedes benz a simple diffuser will look awesome or if you want get the big shark fin carbon diffuser!! I love the JC Sport line AMG muffler tips!
B002E2ZU0M|5|Fits perfect works good

B009DIVZX6|5|I very obvious increase in power just by adding this filter.
B003UCJEOI|4|It does a good job.

B00NOGBAC4|2|Does not work.
B00K150X2E|5|After looking for weeks on Amazon for a good winch, I finally decided on this one. I picked it for its overall value, warranty and Amazon reviews. This thing seems to be very well built, as it weighed just as much as the winch mount I placed it in. The wireless mode is awesome, I love not having to use the cord. As usual, shipping was fast and was not damaged one bit. Overall, I am completely satisfied!!!
B002E59Q2W|5|Fit with no issues!
B00CRHX9E8|1|No noticeable increase in performance either in power or MPG savings. Also the noise it makes sounds like a cross between a small jet engine and a motorcycle.
B001KS0M5O|5|so awesome 2012 ford escape
B00U2UDQKE|5|everything I needed!
B00AZS8PMM|4|Good quality but requires a lot of depth  behind  tv
B0006MRRWG|4|good
B004MDEVAG|5|Very easy to install. On the car in less than 25 minutes. Installed about a year ago. A small section of powder coating is flaking off and rust forming beneath.
B00VBIMGRA|3|the bowl cover trim doesnt fit my 2015 Nissan Qashqai.
B00TE3JL7C|5|Not the real 3M product, but they work as I would expect.  And I enjoy having an extra &#34;chuck&#34;.
B00L2HRUN0|1|Followed size chart. I'm 5'2&#34;. These were way too long. I would have to cut most of the bottom off. I had to return them. If you are petite with a small waist and curves, these aren't for you. It's unfortunate because they seemed to be nice quality for the price.
B00695ZYJ2|5|Love it!
B00A5CM9D4|3|The item did not fit my car however the seller did contact me quickly to resolve the problem
B00AQ2O7XS|4|No leaks and easy direct install with one exception. I was unable to remount the line using the retainer clips. Love the product so far. A must with a heavier clutch installed.
B0007TQWM4|5|Works great
B00EZOUPCA|4|Nice and bright, a great improvement.
B00Y5R43TI|4|Great
B000UO96ZQ|1|I'm not very impressed with the cup. So I  just mounted the Guage  in a little compartment and avoided using cup
B00K6NGL1I|1|This only worked one time then quit. A waste of money!
B0012INT98|1|I used this bag once and everything got wet inside. The material below the zipper got frayed. The plastic material on top cracked in places and water got in. I filled the bag up and it still flapped in the wind. I also had to use a secondary boat strap to keep the front from moving back. I'll definitely be returning this product and buying a hard case.
B00FEAOMQE|2|One of the coil Broke off
B009NOZ5AY|5|👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
B0038I01NM|5|Awesome quality. It definitely got the job done.  Thanks!
B000CIJ308|5|Worked well. would recommend. Keeps tires looking wet for weeks.
B000BUQOCC|5|I hope to never never never EVER use this!!!
B00DQOKCKU|5|Easy to Install and fit perfectly.<br />Have had it for about 2 months now and still great. I've used the bed of the truck pretty hard and it still looks like new. Also used it at the Drive-in and very comfortable to sit on.
B000FW2MC2|5|big and bulky but works great in my old Toyota truck
B000VU5IWE|4|Effective little fuse box. I installed it on my motorcycle, works great for my purpose. Note that the fuse holder / conductors are exposed on the bottom side of the fuse panel so if you are installing over a curved metal surface or an area that could become contaminated with water or dirt, you may want to make a bottom cover. Also with insulated spade lugs attached to the input/outputs you still have exposed metal. I would have preferred if there was a cover over the conductors or if they had used covered screw terminals instead.
B0002U2V1Y|5|It's your standard clay bar kit with clay, detailing spray, and a chamois. I too have heard all the advice of buying bulk clay to save money but this package is a great deal. It's cheaper than any large package of clay and comes with everything you need. Unless you're commercially detailing vehicles, this kit will handle over six vehicles/jobs easily.
B000E0R0HW|5|It work wonderful thank you
B00OPEW8BG|5|I have a 2013 zx6r 636 it fits PERFECT and looks GREAT! Very pleased with this product!
B00BQLN1B2|3|I think I followed the instructions the best I could but the plastic came out so quickly in the first day that I guess I probably did something wrong. I would go to a car shop next time to put them on, would give it another try as I park in the street and this would be helpful (assuming it'll stay on)
B00T6S94R2|5|I used the single lead for my 32&#34; Lightbar and it works great the relay hasn't overheated on me and I have used my Lightbar for long periods of time, I bought a different switch to use because I didn't want to drill a 15/16&#34; hole in my dash.
B00A3UNYW8|5|can not get this to work a 2014 chevy silverado.. new wheels, tires and sensors.. tried everything the book says to do as well as the monitor... any suggestions please? not sure if it is the monitor, tried 4 brand new battery`s as well.. when i fist pressed the monitor button the unit had a strange sound that i thought it was working.. nothing.. battery is in the right way.  since the rims are set back in and the dur trac tires are so beefy as the stock wheels and tires were, wondering if this will ever work on the new ones.  REVISED.. ok now i say i love this thing.. after 2 days of trying everything to get it to work.. put the other tire with the sensor next to the drivers side tire and ran a sensor check, and it worked.. so tried the new tire and sensor on winter tires and it didnt. THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX. got under the truck and redid the sensor check and from behind the tire it worked.. so anyone that has a truck and has went to mud tires try this trick..you do need to get a little dirty as i did..but worth it..
B00VHMJRI6|5|Nice product for the money and it woek perfect in my expedition
B00NDIT4A8|5|Great adhesive with a great statement.

B003V3V61K|5|Great product
B00BCRMAAS|5|Fits very good  thing go great with  amazon  yes
B00S2IED32|2|Unit does not include glass, just the frame.  Why would you want just the frame and not the glass?
B00MOR4CFQ|1|One of the headlight went out within 4 months. Very disappointed. Currently trying to get a warranty on this and sent them an email directly to their customer service email. I'll see how they stand by their product...
B00029WYDU|5|Good~~
B009W4QPN6|5|Fits my trailstar trailer. Direct replacement no more grease on my wheels
B0016LG0CY|4|Worked as expected

B000BYENQC|5|ok
B00C75H3C4|5|Grease
B004W97F6C|5|I ordered these for my recently acquired 2005 Mini Cooper S Hatchback. The right taillight was cloudy.<br /><br />Installation was super easy: access the back side of the existing lights through the panels in &#34;trunk&#34; area; use a 10 mm wrench to remove the nut which holds the light unit; slide the old light unit out; unplug the wiring harness and you are well on the way.<br /><br />Each light uses three light bulbs, 1 amber and 2 clear; however, only the amber bulbs are included. A trip to my local auto parts store followed. I purchased 4 clear 1157 bulbs.<br /><br />Here's where you have to be careful: In order to have the lights set up for back up lights, you have to switch the bottom two light bulbs.  The amber bulb only fits the socket which comes plugged into the center light (the clear circular light which sticks out.) Simply move the amber bulb to the lowest light and unit is set up for backup lights.<br /><br />Overall, the lights dress up the back of the car. We'll just have to see if they prove durable.<br /><br />Picture 1: Old light.<br />Picture 2: New light with taillight burning. This is the top light. It is a 2 element bulb. When the brake pedal is depressed, the second brighter element illuminates.<br />Picture 3: Adding turn signal illuminated. This is the bottom light. This is the amber light, which behind the red lens looks reddish-orange.<br />Picture 4: Add back-up light illuminated. This is the center light.
B00UW4DLJ6|5|Seems to be everything I need in a nice packaged charger. I have not had a chance to use it but came fully charged and gave me peace of mind on the trail knowing it was ready to use if needed.
B0085VAIG2|1|It's two pieces. The bottom part of the seat where you sit is one. The back rest is the second piece. The bottom piece works its way forward with time as you get in and out. Would have been better, WAY BETTER, had it been one piece. If you spill something, it's going to run right down to the seam and out the back. Wish I would not have purchased.
B009AQS4IU|5|i may have wrote review bought many ...anyhow i love these plates put them on my beetle.looks great .my car as my grandson saids now a chicks car....so be it for it surly a nice accent hope no one takes them.nice design
B0002F66GA|5|fits snug love how it went on and the elast inside band is appropreiate fit.
B000C9Q6NY|5|ok
B000BQSIWK|3|One of the main reasons for my purchase of the Schumacher SC-1000A was the advertised desulfination mode.  As far as a charger goes it is OK and would probably garner a 5 if that is what I purchased, but I purchased a charger with a desulfination mode.  Over the years that I have owned this charger it has charged things well, but please know and understand I already owned a battery charger and it has worked just fine for the 40 (forty) plus years that I have owned it.  I do make note at this point on at least one occasion I have noted this charger overcharging a battery and I would suggest anyone leaving a battery hooked up for extended times to observe what is happening to your batteries.  Just saying.  The problem I have with this charger is that it is suppose to have a desulfination function which is suppose to automatically engage when sulfation is detected.  Please note I had two truck batteries hooked up in parallel which became sulfa-ted while using this charger to keep them topped off. Even though unconnecting the batteries from each other and the truck and removing the connectors and unplugging the Schumacher SC 1000A and repeated replugging and hooking up the connectors to the battery this supposed auto desulfination mode never made its self known to me.  It has never engaged on any other battery I have charged either.  The two truck batteries in question are clearly sulfa-ed.  Now if the claim had been made that this the Schumacher SC1000A was a might,possibly, ma-by,  engage ,if it was the second week of lent,  desulfinator I would not have much to say.  Now I would suggest that the Schumacher engineers place an extra button on their chargers that would allow this function to engage manually and all problems would be solved, but until that happens this in my esteemed opinion can not be advertised as a Desulfinator.  I have puchased a desulfinator that only does desulfinates and I would suggest anyone needing such a function to do the same and to treat the Schumacher charger as a charger.  5 stars as a charger, 0 stars as a desulfinator, the average being 3 stars.
B002QGVWBW|5|good product
B000GKAZVI|5|Great product for protecting doors in your garage or enclosed carport. After reading reviews of many similar products on Amazon I decided on this one. Examining product upon arrival, it seems to be Styrofoam with a thin plastic coating. Pressing on it shows it's not too hard yet soft enough to give a little.<br />I installed by using the mounting tape on the product & sticking it to the inside wall of my metal carport. It's been over a week with daytime high temps from 100 to 105. They're still attached.<br />Update 10-16-2016: I've been using this product since July in central Texas. I originally installed on the aluminium panel on the inside of my carport. The panels go all the way to the ground on the sides. Gets kinda hot down here in the summer. Within a couple weeks the adhesive tape started releasing. So I put a small amount of Gorilla Glue in four spots along the top edge. No problems since. Excellent protection for my Mustangs door edges.  No marks on the car door edges or on the protectors. Will have to see how they hold up to our &#34;winters&#34;.
B007O5GWV0|4|Quick and very easy....
B002MHDY2K|5|This bag is Great it's well constructed and fits perfectly on my 2014 FLHTK also the bottle holders work well and are easy to reach .
B000TYQB14|5|Fit perfectly works great!  Just what I needed!!
B00FEL30R0|5|I live near some railroad tracks with a white Tacoma truck. The dust from the tracks causes little rust blotches on my paint. I spray this on as directed and a few mins later the truck is back to smooth and spotless again. Great product
B008G3KCHE|5|Just like the original ones. Love them. Now I can see at night.
B00S70XINQ|5|We have been using these radiators with our race cars for 2 yrs now. The only reason to replace is when we get in an accident during a race. Other than that, they have been perfect. Great fit too!! Fits right into the stock location.
B00WH166Z8|5|easy install.  oem part
B004O9CE70|5|Looks exactly like the original Mercruiser alternator, with higher amperage output, it has a smaller pulley, which will make it charge at a lower engine rpm.  Shipping was fast, packaging very good.  Great Seller .
B0076AU0YS|5|Antenna works great as a replacement for my car.
B0049W4VVE|5|fits perfect.  not in the way.  holds my drink or anything really i want to slip in the front pocket. and the big compartment holds my everyday stuff like wallet or camera  bug spray ect.  i do have the box on the back but i use that for tools. this is perfect for more fragile stuff. water proof too.
B009MVNSGQ|5|As I passed 98,000 miles on my '12 Impreza Sport Premium, I started researching the recommended 100,000 mile maintenance.  That's when I discovered the recommended interval for spark plugs was 60,000 miles (oopsie!).  These are the exact model number as what comes standard in that reliable little four-banger, and they installed without a problem.<br />For tools, you'll need a 10mm socket and ratchet, preferably in 1/4&#34; drive to remove/install the ignition coils, and a 14mm deepwell, 2&#34; extension, and ratchet all in 3/8&#34; drive for the spark plugs.  The rear driver's plug was the hardest one for me due to the nearby wire harnesses, but this nerd was done with all four in about 30 minutes.  Don't coat the threads with any form of lubricant as these plugs are designed without the need.<br />Five stars for the product was exactly as described, shipped promptly, and it's a spark plug!  It either works, or it doesn't.  I am pleased with my purchase.
B00UZ0OHIQ|5|Good item
B00252928M|5|Worked exactly as described.
B002Q1EHZU|5|Love it
B002GTKAHQ|4|Easy to install, crazy cheap compared to what you could buy at cycle gear, works fine. Remember to use blue Loctite 242/243 on the threads though!
B00EC2CG9U|5|Great for what I needed them for.
B004PG963M|5|Great for appliances - installed this on my in-law's LG built-in oven.  The door stopped wanting to stay fully closed, and this does an awesome job of helping it stay fully shut.  Light doesn't flicker on and off, food cooks faster.  I would agree with others that the pull feels like it's maybe a tad short of 40lbs, but not far off.  It's strong!
B000JFL7ZS|5|must have for changing filters .
B003VGL28Y|4|Would be nice to have some instructions for installation, it is a good quality exact match.
B00K65MW8M|1|Could not get this to do anything. I think it's a scam, does not work.
B0044AVL8W|5|Fit my 2003 canry perfectly
B006PAR142|5|It fix perfet
B0045S6W28|5|Fits perfectly. easy to insatal
B004X96DLE|1|When viewing this product, it seemingly fixes colors universally and shows (2) different &#34;pens&#34; when viewing.  Upon receiving the product, just one pen labeled &#34;metallic black&#34; and no &#34;mystery&#34; pen with no color label.  Indicates EXACT OEM MATCH metallic black with no vehicle listed.  Very disappointed in my purchase, feel I've been duped by a long winded lack of description.  I'd recommend seeing if your car has a metallic black option before you order this product. It likely won't match your color.
B00407NK6A|1|This paint is absolutely horrible, and a waste of money... it runs like water, and actually damages the existing back....
B00Y2EMTFO|5|A great take-along for any smoking needs. Small, but big enough and easy to clean.
B0067DR17O|5|best bang for the buck.. very bright.. no flicker.. about 3 weeks in I'm very pleased. to add after spending $50 plus dollars at an auto customization shop after every bulb blew.. the chump flag is flying high.. but no more..<br /><br />*** update *** 9/7 one bulb burnt out..<br /><br />**updsate ** 9/11  wasn't the bulb.. was a fuse .. great buy !
B008V6PVSG|1|started out nice but they are not water proof and stoped working middle of the second winter season
B0109H6BN8|2|Starting with the blocker plate, hardware was incorrect, the bolt going into the intake manifold was to small, the bracket bolted onto the egr inlet pipe with no problem but had to pry pretty far to line mount up, not good on the pipe. Supplied silicone heater hose for bypass was 2 inches to short, had to supply my own. Up pipe went in ok and looks good but again a couple bolts were incorrect and mounting positions did not line up ( see picture). Does not have any threaded ports to add aftermarket gauge. Good price but don't expect a &#34;bolt in installation&#34;.
B00VSRLOP4|4|A good product. I was expecting them to be stainless but they were black, I assume that they are still stainless bolts. I checked the package details and everything seemed to be in order. The black bolts work better for me because it works out with my blackout farings set, the moment of truth will be when I actually put them on but I expect they will he fine. The only concern I have is that there is no tail light bolts and it doesn't make sense not to include bolts when you spend a nice chunk of money on bolts, clips, and washers.
B008ECC31U|4|The piece fit in the bumper pretty good. It is not a perfect fit like the original but works fine and looks great.
B005KI6TFM|1|horrible quality. one broke into pieces when I tried screwing it in, the other one had the actual mirror piece fall out the first time I went on the freeway.
B009V18F1U|4|Installation went well, instructions are a little short and some of the brackets are miss marked but easily noticed once exhaust is in its location and it's just a matter of switching around mounts. Sounds and performs much better than factory modified exhaust. Would recommend it as an affordable performance exhaust.
B003L35990|5|Its hard to say if it is better than its competition.  You can't really determine its superiority unless you send your oil out to a company that analyzes oil.  I would have had to take a sample from my old oil and before switching filters and than after switching.  I am not willing to spend that type of effort or money.<br />You can notice its obvious difference in weight compared to other filter though.  It is a very heavy filter.  I will have to go by the manufacturers claims on what it does for my oil and engine.  I bought it because I bought Royal Purple 5w-30 at the same time.
B00ZGCNGC6|5|I had just posted a review on a purchase of 10 CLEAR 3/4 round LED lights where i only gave them a 2 star rating. However with THESE lights they are FAR BETTER in illumination, perhaps it had to do with the manufacturing being in USA or that the company was the 1st to develope this style of light, either way if when looking to purchase it appears Tec Niq has a more refined product when bright lights are required, an so everyone knows i am not normally a &#34;Name&#34; buyer but in this instance perhaps i will be.
B007QQRKXG|5|a must have for re installing plastic automotive trim.
B00HVHMUTE|5|Love it
B00HVI0ZMW|1|Didn't like it
B00GSYJ4RM|5|Great product. Buy with confidence
B004ME11FS|5|works great
B00GSAUHB8|4|seems to be working and is easy to put up and take down...more of a dash protector than a heat repellant.... did watch a you tube video on how to close it
B00B4IFYYO|5|***** Perfect fit thanks
B004GEOCP0|5|The part arrived sooner thsn expected. It was a perfect fit!
B00EHIOOBW|5|Easy installation in my Sorento.  Plug and play.  Plenty of Youtube videos demonstrating all there is to know about making the connections.  It's really very simple.  Almost no tools needed.  One ballast failed after a few hours of use but the manufacturer stood behind the product and sent a replacement part very quickly.  I've now had them installed for over a month with no issues.  They look great and make it so much easier to see at night.  Really very pleased.  The best part was this kit cost less than replacing halogen bulbs again, and the HID results are so much better it's not even funny.  Edit: October 2015: still working great!   Absolutely thrilled with the performance of these lights.  Night driving is so much better now, my only regret is waiting so long to get HIDs.    I've ordered a second set of lights to replace my fog lights as well.   Driving this winter is going to be a whole different thing for me!  Pros: Great results, extremely good value, great support Cons: None worth mentioning
B00RICQ88Q|3|The unit was clean and compatible but less than half the bulbs were in working order.
B001ROWZHY|5|perfect
B003T1OQVQ|5|Easy setup, fast shipping, and good price.
B0087ZX3XG|5|Good price
B00F40Q5UA|5|Got to be the simplest little tool to watch your engines life and keep up wnith maintenance. Would recommend to anyone that doesn't have an hour meter and like to keep up on preventative maintenance. Have one on my trail jeep since it doesn't collect a lot of mileage.
B000XQ9MGE|1|Did not start car, (after MANY tries!) despite being the unit rec. by the mfgr. (four cyl.. Saturn wagon)  Conflicting info about charge status in manual.  (about charge lights; what constitutes a &#34;charged&#34; unit,and what doesn't...?) Amazon would not take unit back, as unit is &#34;non-returnable&#34;.  So, it is up to me to take it apart, and dispose of the battery  Needless to say, I won't be buying another unit from this mfgr.  I should have known better; you buy cheap, you get cheap... (although $64 ain't exactly change in my book!)
B00LL6PK2K|1|Received a used one as i can see a lots of scratches not happy at all of the tape around the box. I ordered a new device but received a used one. Its working fine
B009QLBDSW|5|Very easy to use, does not mar your paint or anything. I've been using them frequently to work on my car.
B00BCRMB34|5|O:-)
B00BSA8SJ6|5|Bought this for my dad for Fathers Day this past year and he loves the thing. He keeps it in his old pickup and has used it several times. The magnet on the bottom is very strong and more handy than I originally expected it to be, and it's very convenient to have a flexible bending neck on it. The beam from the LEDs is not super bright or super condensed but this isn't made to be your main work light in your shop, it's made for emergency lighting or while camping, etc.
B002UC30AS|5|Very nice!
B006H822YG|3|for the money, these do the job
B001V8PRAS|3|Mecanisum worked real hard not real happy with it
B003TU662Y|5|Works great gets the job done
B000WHACHC|5|I have a 2006 Grand Caravan and this is a great addition between the front seats. I also did not need mount it to the floor.
B00838808A|5|Nice product
B000C8ZGHC|5|Fit my 98 Jeep Cherokee perfect, arrived quickly as well.
B001EP2904|5|fits perfect
B000WJX6IM|5|I've been using S100 for years.  I started using on my motorcycles but it has been convenient to use on cars, lawn mowers, weed eaters, and anything else that just needs a quick spray of soap instead of making a wash bucket.  It rinses cleanly and is safe for all surfaces.
B00SVRHD22|5|great product
B00A23V5EU|5|Perfect fit for my Yukon Denali
B000NVW1LM|1|ATP AT-205 didn't work unfortunately. It is a false publicity.
B00QHA3356|5|Works great! Highly recommended!
B00DIGEKUE|5|Worked perfectly
B00267PZUK|1|One spark plug done, and the extration tip is so worn it won't grip a second plug. 60 bucks is a little steep for a one and done tool.
B009ESAZHW|5|They are well worth the money
B000JZY4D0|5|Excellent product and easy to install!
B009DJTPRI|1|Came in broken
B00GWV57FY|4|Looks great, simple to install. Havent seen any benefit or disadvantage in radio reception compared to factory antenna. Seems basically for aesthetics.
B005OL7K4E|5|awesome!!
B000C9IYQQ|5|working good
B003UZ7SCU|5|Great fit and easy installation. My son loves it. I would recommend.
B004RINXPA|4|Fun and worth the $$$$
B0002U1TZS|1|pure garbage
B00BD4YFO4|5|Arrived on time and fit like they were supposed to.
B00192JF9U|5|This will keep em out,easy install.
B00FRHOI86|5|Fits perfect
B00BG3WXA0|5|Exactly the same coils. One third of the price when purchased in the states. Fitted to Saab aero 2.8t. Would recommend
B000BNZ7DQ|5|My boyfriend loves it! Fit perfectly and looks awesome on his truck!
B00ARUU3QY|5|Part works flawlessly.  Also ordered the one for the front drivers side door.  It too is functioning flawlessly
B008FCE5D8|4|Shouldn't have been so hard to find but they fit perfectly. Could have used better instructions for mounting but luckily my friend had just put some on her Enclave and was a great help.Installed my kayak carrier and am ready to hit the water.
B00IPC6ILK|4|Came on time.. Bout the size of bottom of an can.. smaller than pictured.. also careful wiping over will catch an Pell up
B004K7ZE7S|4|Great price for a Strut but there was no mention that these are the drivers side struts. To ad to this there is an answer to a question of basically are these universal. The answer given was yes, left and right. This is incorrect obviously.
B001EDK0WK|5|Works great for soap. Convenient container to pour safely.
B002MFXQIE|5|These are excellent; far higher quality than I expected. They are a thick high-quality flexible plastic material that is crystal clear, well crystal-yellow, whatever, you get my point - they don't cause the light-beam to become diffused. The adhesive is very strong, but also has enough forgiveness that you can remove a shield if you really botch up an install. Once installed they look like an original part of the lamp, but should also provide some stone protection you wouldn't get with a yellow-glass lens. I can't speak to how yellow the light is if you use clear bulbs, as I paired them with the 85w yellow hella bulbs, which together provide a very bright yellow light. I've had them on since just before last winter. They held up through the winter, car-washes, bug splatter, etc. and still look as good as new. Very pleasantly surprised.
B00LX6GI8S|5|Perfect fit.  BMW Bentley guide says to slide old marker forward then rotate up and over and remove.  Don't worry about that.  Just use a good non-marring pry tool (a few $ at harbor freight) and use blue painters tape around perimeter starting on door side of marker.  Pop open the door side, then work your way to the front and pull.  You really can break anything (that was my worry) as the old light is the casing and if fits into the cut metal of the body.  When re-installing gently push /work into place ( remove sticker on new light first, this should help).  When it gets about 85-90% in, take a one minute break (trust me) go back and the rest should go in easily.  First side takes about 10 minutes, second about 4 minutes.  Total time less than twenty and they look great.  Just like OEM.  Oh and be sure to check operation and working order before you pop new ones in after the (easy clip) wire harness is connected.  ( Installed on '09 335i and look great)
B00FRHOGU6|3|Purchased a set of these for both mine & my wife's car. After ~2 months, the wiping element on my wife's driver side blade seems to freely slide out of the blade if I don't reposition it every 4-5 days. More annoying than anything else. The other 3 blades are wonderful.
B00VR0UTLM|1|Sucks, just a basic decal. Looks like it is 2 dimensional in add.
B00GBBCMDA|5|Fits like a glove, if you have kids you have to get this. I love it, as good as weathertech and much cheaper.
B00I1KMLTO|5|Good. Met all expectations
B00K35W6PO|4|Great price good to do business with
B000B8JUNY|1|This item does not fit 1999 Mazda mx-5 as indicated.  It threads in fine, but the fuel door will not close due to the molded grip that extends out from the cap.  Check your vehicle for the needed clearance before purchasing.  Due to my own time constraints, I missed the 30-day return window so the item went in the garbage.  Don't follow my example.  An unfortunate waste indeed.
B000E4NM8E|1|I installed the mirror today (8/9/15). It looks exactly like the OEM. It was easy to install (Thanks to Youtube, no boxed instructions.). Be careful NOT to drop the nuts down into the door. After I had them very loose, I gripped them with needle nose pliers so that they didn't fall. All went well, however, after putting the door back together, the mirror motor doesn't rotate in towards the driver. Up, Down and Out are fine, but not In. The motors are definitely noisier than OEM, but I just wanted function. The OEM painted front side fits exactly, if you don't break the plastic clips getting it apart (see Youtube for that also).  I can't drive the truck without a side view mirror, so it will have to stay, unless the Vendor and or Amazon can work something out.  Today I received an email from the seller. They want me to take the defective mirror off of the truck, pay for return shipping, then they will determine if it is defective, or not. I explained to them that I can't drive around without a mirror for  a day, days or weeks til they figure it out.  &#34;You'll have to make a new purchase for the part as we do not send replacements can will only issue the refund when the return is received and inspected.  After inspection is done and we have confirmed that there is a problem with the product, we will issue a full refund for the purchase together with the return shipping costs. Regards, APV&#34;  I have down graded the seller AND product to one star. Would have gone lower if possible. My next step is to Amazon customer service
B007WR66QQ|5|Perfect replacement for my 2009 Audi A4. Fast shipping, definitely would recommend!
B00ANQ25OA|2|Bulbs are not great with light quality (feels dim)!!!!<br />Cost wise - fine.
B002BG4WX2|3|I used this product in My truck and it works.<br />however I used it in one of my cars and it did not work. I would say it works best on small leaks.
B008XKLAFI|5|Excellent
B00EZIJ7UW|5|Super deal and come with 30amp fuses installed
B00AVQSFT6|5|Like it.  Came in 2 days.
B00CCE6ISK|2|2013 Suzuki VStrom DL650<br /><br />Screws are cheap and the drive strips easily. The electrical outlets can spin freely. The terminals for the LED cables are recessed, so it's very difficult to thread both wires at once.<br /><br />It's not all that bad, but it just feels like a $20 kit, not $59.
B00HTP8N0I|5|very useful
B00DFVV3BG|5|VERY GOOD
B00HJ15AJ4|3|Its a nice license plate frame however it's feels like it will break easy and it only has two pre-cut screw holes instead of normal plates that have four which was a disappointment because now my plate isn't secured at the bottom like it should be so it doesn't sit securely and it does not include screws either.
B00H874CMA|4|Great product! Works like a charm if u know how to drive your car
B00KWMI5KS|5|Like the way you can size them to fit your vehicle. More ways to trim than most mats.
B000N321MO|5|Love it
B000C32J5O|5|Worked great on my 05' Taurus.
B004SZFCPG|5|works great with my 2015 Cobra 29 LX radio.  Good audio reports with DynaMike anywhere between 50-100%
B00BH0UD1I|5|meets expectations
B0048J4TC4|1|I purchased this for my chrysler lebaron and it said it would work so i purchased the rear motors for the left and right side. They are too small for the car. I received them in one box and now i am getting double charged to return them. Nice job Amazon!
B003EMCGB2|5|Haven't installed them yet but they feel beefier than the stock shafts. Kit is complete with all the parts you need including outer bearings and seals.
B0034TOGEA|5|Product arrived quickly and was as described.
B001JT5OGG|5|You had exactly what I wanted at fair price.<br />Love it!
B00E9HWS9G|5|Cut to fit the back cargo space in my Chevy Captiva Sport. Looks great - I've been afraid of spills and this will work fine.
B00E4CQ2JI|5|Product arrived quickly and was as described.
B00AVA3BBE|4|This is the best fuel jug I ever used. Up to this date I have not spilled a drop of fuel. If there is a second handle to use while pouring, I will rate it five stars.
B002NGCO30|5|LOVE THIS!!!  I got it & immediately charged it for 24hrs as instructed--and now I'm ready to GO!  It will make my travels more confident & I can charge all my electronics (plus it has it's own generator--but if I need, I have a generator in my trailer with which I'll be able to re-charge this unit should I need to do so...)
B0002L6ULK|5|I love it and it fits perfectly.
B00RGZWIW0|5|I had been looking for a good quality trunk organizer worth my money. This is it. Structure is great, very practical, and the material is good quality. I love the color and the design. I cannot wait to purchase more products from Busy Life.
B00HTOB0NG|5|easy to install
B00AQ2OE8G|5|Good quality line, fits and performs well
B00MPIR5FS|5|Awesome kit!! Id recomended always, my vehicle looks amaizing
B008OIUKKK|5|Great mats.. They were delivered ontime and in good conditions. The mats fit great and feel high quality.
B0036GL5F4|4|excellent replacement for the jap junk that was oem
B00REJX5BQ|4|Fits perfect and is very easy to install. Does good keeping weather out.
B0089LTFF8|5|Is exactly the same as  the OEM part and at half the cost of what the dealer would charge me.<br />Installation takes one minute.
B00B1SDFSO|5|I removed the &#34;milk jugs&#34; from my front bumper of my Jeep Wrangler TJ and bought these caps to fill the ends of the bumper. They fit perfectly and gave my front bumper a finished look. It does not come with hardware and I went to Lowes for that. Received on schedule. I would recommend it.
B00G96VESG|2|This fuse holder fits both 1 1/4 inch fuses and the little fuses also. It is spring loaded to make contact with the fuse ends.  When a little use is inserted and seated the spring tension is insufficient  to  maintain electrical contact when the end wires are moved in certain ways.  Therefore I found it not reliable when used with little fuses.
B001FY0H94|5|Look nice on our new 4-wheeler
B00ZMIY1NC|1|Sunshade and fresheners are amazing. The only problem is that sunshade doesnt come with holders to cover all the windshield
B002YKNVNC|5|Works great, use it almost everyday
B00BDQL8ZG|5|Works great!!!
B000H8U1WM|5|excellent as described
B001C9562K|5|Significantly improves braking for my Yukon Denali
B0014DINF6|5|I received this tool in perfect conditions. I recommend this product, i tested and it works perfect!!
B003S72W3U|5|Fits and looks great.  I had to use almost all of the pieces for my 50/50 split 1991 Ford 3/4 ton front bench seat.
B0006301QE|5|Very Nice
B00EFDAFZ8|4|They work.
B00U868BN4|1|Does nothing except have a pretty blue light and takes up a charging space. I am not a happy camper it was a total waste.
B0066PI154|1|Horrible design and it never works no matter what. Not worth a single penny.
B003ITIUOI|5|After using the filter for 3000 miles on my 14 cruze I've been pulling about 3 miles a gallon more than the stock filter. Been using K&N for for my vehicles for years and never disappointed in their performance. On my 81 Camaro Z-28 it's been on since 2002 and still working great.
B000C2G60Y|5|It worked just like it was supposed to work. No leaks.
B000IYR7G8|5|Worked fantastic
B00BUL1KRK|5|This is the BEST stuff on the planet! Do not use anything else. We had some tough mirrors and light fixtures that Windex and several other products couldnt get clean. This stuff did the job! I am impressed -
B00EVPLRRU|5|So much easier to use than the cheap units I've been using.
B00192KY04|5|Good fit,easy to install.
B000KE2LZS|1|Not as custom as they say and the sides are very cheap and the color is way off. It's a lot darker than the actual picture
B00B6QF0U2|4|Does it fit my 2015 toyota corolla le
B000GU5ILA|1|Leaked by and filled my carburetor bowl
B00GKTZAHS|2|Because of the heat all the stickers stuck to each other, which pulled the coloring off the stickers.
B00KNMKRU8|2|Not bad but it doesn't do a jump start like they said it would. You have to wait 30 minutes before you can actually start the engine.
B007WQQNQA|5|Great product at a great price and excellent delivery
B003UWQFKY|5|Great product but it's takes forever to put on but the shine was like I've never seen
B000CLMGAY|3|Wear out fast
B00NFSNAS8|4|I am want to buy the inflation hose for 260psi SAFARI interdynamics portable car tire air compressor.  Can you help me with this request?  THANKS MIGUEL
B00IHAAGAE|5|Great product. Easy to install. Can only recommend!
B001C9C3YO|5|Filters matches perfectly to my 2001 Dodge Durango SLT 4X4 4.7 liter!
B000C2UDZI|5|Works just like it's supposed to. Have had it for several months now and it still works fine.
B003EOTU5U|4|A 4 star for the mounting hardware.  Cheap junk! Every single bolt stripped on the threads and had to be cut out. Had to go and buy new hardware that was black and grade 8. Other than that, nice product.
B008XNZZ7O|5|Works within a few hours. VERY impressed!!
B0014JUHA4|5|Great quality! Easy to install. I didn't want my car to be a free advertisement for the dealership.
B00ISUNBPU|1|useless buy real  thing
B0114I9HFK|5|Arrived promptly and works as described. There is a battery setting and a solar setting. I don't really know where the battery is or if it recharges in the sun. For the solar setting, it does work depending on how bright the day is.
B004AFGJBA|1|The part fit as advertised like original.
B00RU0L2EG|2|Ok
B00O0E60M4|4|Stickers arrived a little slow but the person who got them loved them.
B0006PY0OQ|2|I like the product but not sure why it  warped in the center  (sagging in the middle ) . Other then that I can live with it<br />Thx LM.
B00NPIN8FI|5|Brightness to the Extreme! The white color temperature is also very good. I use these for Rear Backup Lights on a Jeep Wrangler 2000 and it lights things up like daylight when backing up at night. Been using for a couple months - so far so good.
B005KDQTCK|4|It is the same color as mentioned (I have cirrus white on my car).<br /><br />Only reason why I put it down to 4 stars was that it is like Cirrus White in a white-out bottle. Maybe it's just me.
B00C79NHNY|5|This is a very high quality rubber drive shaft flex joint. The majority being sold online are cheapy Uro brand made who knows where. The Eurospare Jurid coupling is exactly the same as the original I removed from my Jaguar. When I say exactly the same, I mean the same manufacturer markings and made in Germany. The only difference between the two is one was 20 years old and starting to crack.  So I say pay a little more(but still way less than for dealer branded parts) and enjoy the savings and peace of mind of actual OEM parts.
B00KY0B4FQ|5|Item as described  ..works great fits perfect
B00877SL2M|5|they work and are pretty bright. even hooked them up to my solar panel and was still bright on 6v. it was a cloudy day.
B0000AXY5A|3|The Ford emblem is a great piece but I gave it a 3 star rating because the support piece that attaches to it and goes in the receiver is plastic. The last one of these I bought was aluminum. When will companies stop making items cheaper to save a little money at the sacrifice of quality. I also do not remember it saying it was plastic in the product description.
B000DZF3WM|5|Protected our white carpets when we were moving into our new home. Definitely saved our carpets from getting destroyed. Worked great.
B000QJG1IA|5|Love it sound's great
B005I5T5YO|5|The Delco key blank was perfect. Our good local hardware store cuts blanks customers bring in at no cost. Simple instructions for programming the the car to accept the cut key are included in the Saturn Owner's Manual, a quick success.
B00FGXEDTK|5|Arrived on time, worked perfectly!  I love that ye harnesses are included.  Great deal for both!
B00K7YMK4I|5|perfect for my plates
B00192JGY4|5|These work great. Remember propane is presume so if you still have half a tank it might read full but when you start getting low you will know.
B00E1D1GY6|1|Ever since I got my AutoExec attachment, people and cars and stuff keep getting in my way - and you can't honk the horn if you're using a normal-size laptop.  This thing needs to be re-designed so it doesn't disable the car's horn.
B007HRN4N4|5|not much to go wrong here. replaced the hardened seal on my roof vent. No issues
B00VEDWKVY|1|Wasnt as adveristed ended up getting lost had to file a claim
B000GZSZN8|5|Excellent grips, install was smooth and ride improvement was noticeable.
B00W1WK9HE|5|It works fine.
B001ABMM3G|5|I ordered this as a replacement for my 1st generation TRD intake system for my 05+ Tacoma. As TRD doesn't sell the replacement filter for this intake system anymore I was able to find the aFe equivalent as they make the systems for TRD. Perfect fit, excellent construction and offers a bit more air flow as the top of the filter is open unlike the TRD. . As you can see from the pictures, I took comparison photos.
B003ZAGPWO|5|Husband thought they were great item!
B00JF5LRN0|5|Awesome product...you won't be disappointed.
B0046I3I8I|3|Next time I'll upgrade to heavier but more expensive ones.  Serves the purpose.
B007JMOWP6|5|Exactly what I expected, I will order from them again
B00XVCAZD6|5|Great!!! So happy to find this a little larger than the stock rack....and fits my scooter nicely :)
B002J7KCOG|4|Good to dust the furnature
B000JFJMFK|4|Did what it was supposed to do
B000RFSARI|2|No check valve so if you don't shut manual valve poop water can get back into hose.  Also, water doesn't jet out very well.  More of a gimmick and not necessary.  That being said since I have it, I use it.  Won't buy another one.  Will try and find something better
B003OB0OG2|5|Fit perfectly. My 2007 Mustang GT has a plastic connector combining three hoses into one another on the bottom hose, not the best design. This hose set removes that possible leak point.
B002X56XBA|5|Took a few weeks to get there but my bf was so happy when he saw them it was so worth it
B000OCHE7Q|5|I love it
B0042KJV9U|5|Great price! Arrived fast! Used as soon as I got it! Solved a problem so simply! I highly recommend this!
B0002KKTFO|5|Heavy duty, flexible hose great to get into those hard to reach spots.  Glad I went with this product rather than a cheaper alternative.
B00GSAUHB8|5|product ok but did not fit either vehicle, 2012 town and country and 2001 chevy express van, returned for refund, thanks!!
B000CPM0FQ|5|Cheaper than my local autopart store and fits perfectly in my 2000 Buick Lesabre
B00HZBA87M|4|As advertised
B000VKRQ7Y|5|Worked perfectly in my 2006 Toyota Corolla.  Wouuld certaintly buy again.
B006R7AW6M|5|Had this on for about 3 weeks now. Very happy. Installation is simple if you have the tools for it but I decided to go to my mechanic. fitment on a 2011 suburban LT. Ride feels either the same or better. Make sure you get an alignment as soon as you get it installed.
B005D5TNYQ|5|Great product, easy installation
B000CF5U76|5|Made my diesel engine run like new.
B00KZPHNXC|5|This is a factory hose and fits perfectly without having to trim to fit. It has arrows to indicate the direction of flow. This hose should last many many years before replacing.
B00I12ZYIC|5|Very handy and accurate. I ordered 4 of them.
B00PJHYDPW|5|:)
B000ZMHNK8|5|Good stuff.
B000FQ23ZO|4|Fit well.
B004R31XY8|4|Perfect fit, looks very custom. Only negative is it whistles over 40mph, but this disappears with a cargo box on it. Easy to remove when not needed.
B00U7XT1C8|4|When the sun hits it, it makes it more challenging to see through the glare, but all in all, I like the protection from the sun. It slides down the visor sometimes when on a bumpy road.  I have 2 and find it is worth it.
B000FQ2278|4|It was a little hard to install but got it to work.
B004PC49ZQ|5|:)
B00D8FUCWA|5|Product fit and it shipped out fast
B008G39Y0U|4|Product looks great. But had to have aimed at body shop
B00NJRGD70|5|very nice shade
B00R2YXDI8|1|old product--glue doesn't stick
B000CRFJ5M|4|Replacement fan belt dimension matched the old belt just fine and was easy to install on the pulley of the whole house ventilation fan. I just couldn't understand the reasoning behind the photo showing a &#34;Warcraft&#34; game. I didn't know for certain if a fan belt would arrive or a game would show up on my doorstep. Fortunately, the belt was the item that did arrive and packaged very well!
B00BPBQPAC|5|Exact part
B000C2YDK4|5|Super cheap an excellent quality
B000630AHO|5|2004 Jeep grand Cherokee Laredo. I have not noted any gains in gas mileage, moreover, according to my trip computer its worse. However, there is a noticeable increase in acceleration.
B00407V4YK|4|Did the job.
B003UT3XKC|5|It doesn't get any better.
B001PNE8O0|5|very
B004GCNJ1U|1|does NOT fit, looks nice out of box, stud placement is about 3/8&#34; off
B00JBIX9SM|1|Terrible. They leak don't buy
B00PSZR63G|5|Best product ever!
B00BMU9CEM|5|Used this wheel to remove sun-destroyed decals from my 10 year old RV. Takes some time but they came off just fine without damaging the gel coat under them. The wheel looks to be about 1/2 used up to remove about 144 square inches (12&#34; x 12&#34;) of decals.
B00B7MZ7L2|4|Thought lenses would be darker,but they're sufficient,look great!!
B0015PRVNI|1|Lights do not fit a 2006 Dodge Ram 3500 SLT. Cost me 12$ to return to them.
B001TJ3HUG|5|It doesn't get any better.
B0040HWR1E|5|Love it!
B00QOJW62Q|5|These are great. They are easy to install and I like the fact I can move them around.
B00BYNJANU|5|Great shocks and a great price fast shipping. Fit my 08 f350 4&#34; lift.
B00HNP91VO|3|After a few uses, some of the LEDs are out. It is bright and built tough. Just wish the bulbs didnt go out as soon as they did. Same thing happened on a second we got.
B00UHD4HJA|1|If you want a bunch of stupid, lame stickers that are only popular in China, get these. You will not, however, get any of the stickers that are pictured in the product description. And, these in particular, SHIP FROM CHINA. So, you wait for weeks to get them, and then when you finally get them you are disappointed and can't return them.
B007Y87WU2|5|Excellent
B004GE8UZI|4|This is not exactly the same as the original but close
B00D6H8AEW|5|Took awhile to get here (from China), but they're great. We have a Nissan Leaf and it was close to incredible that we got one that almost matches the buttons on the actual remote!
B004JZVPE2|5|Cleans good with no streaks
B001AXGT7O|5|The extreme max 3001 is a well built unit, very well assembled and easy to install. I am well pleased.
B0002SRCMO|5|works good
B00C8YXH9C|5|These flares are what they say they are and do what they say they do I would recommend these flares for anyone who doesn't want the bother of the burning flares besides they do wear out and sometimes don't work these will work they're the best thing that I found around
B000HE2VF6|5|Hand tool set to have when doing tire rotation
B0097SDUTE|5|This product has restored my car’s engine idle from “diesel like” to normal. I am using it regularly now: 20 oz. every three months – to keep engine running smoothly. Highly recommended.
B00G4L23PY|5|A+
B0034NH404|5|Great helmet! Great price! I buy these helmets and do custom airbrushing on.<br />CB GRAPHICS
B004I0SW1W|5|Super-easy to install. Came with all bulbs already in place, which was a nice surprise. A very good bargain. Shipping was fast and efficient.
B00B4CTKA4|5|Seller took 2-3 business days to ship (they stated up to 3) so I can't be disappointed.  Anyways my 2006 did not have any sizing problems that other posts mention.  Part is OME perfect.
B00HJD4DRC|3|Must have resistors on each LED bulb in circuit,  and, must change all bulbs on circuit to LED if on turn signal they blink twice as fast without them.
B00F6E2F9Y|5|Perfect fit... and easy to install.  Will order from them again.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Although seat belts don't really fit through slot, it doesn't matter because material is maleable enough to fill gap and still fasten belt. This product saves a lot of frustration.
B00SK12GKS|5|My dad has this on his older HD, and recommended it for my restyled 2014.<br /><br />He is shorter and has a shorter narrower seat so I'm assuming the top of his head is where my eyes are. I'm average height with a stock seat. He thinks it's great with no wind on his helmet (took a several state trip with him--he loves it), however, at expressway speeds I feel pressure on my helmet and want ear plugs.<br /><br />I wanted more air around town and this gives me that. Stock just the top of my head gets wind and this one eyes up and around my shoulders get wind.<br /><br />For colder temperatures and any expressway traveling I'm switching back to stock, but for my ride to work this looks cool and keeps me a little cooler.<br /><br />This screen does not warp and flop around at speed like some other aftermarket screens I had on my previous bike. This one is great quality. I like this brand.<br /><br />If they make an 8.5 to 9&#34; version with a lighter tint that might be a one screen solution for me.
B000EDUUG2|5|Great broom for the RV or household. Folds up into a small space but isn't flimsy. I like that the pan assembles to the brush for added space and organization. Shipped quickly.
B001V8PRBM|5|ITS A NICE WHEEL CHOCK!
B008OK0OCW|5|Very good after-market product.
B00SLKESZE|5|super good
B000GZOW7Q|5|Great shipping bolt on runs great
B001P1KKJO|5|I was never really a bumper sticker kind of person until I got my Toyota FJ Cruiser. Saw this and had to get it. The red did fade after the 2nd year, but it's outside in Florida weather and sun 24/7. So this is my 2nd to replace the 1st with a fresh one. People love it, I get a lot of comments.
B003AT4RHK|5|worked just as advertised
B00E6A69NM|2|Not what I ecpected
B007NNK3D6|5|I've never worn this style of boot before , but it was easy to get used to.
B000SBCHCA|4|A+
B000RDC1CU|5|Works Perfectly, this is the second one I have purchased for multiple cars. Not sure why more OEM's don't include this technology on new vehicles
B00WJD8DBY|5|Switch works as should.
B000FPZRDA|2|I wanted to replace galvanized steel thimble with stainless steel one, unpacked the rope from its factory wrapping and first thing that caught my attention is the fact that rope is so loosely twisted and spliced that thimble almost fell out on its own.<br />It took no effort at all to replace thimble, if holding by thimble and pulling on rope, it all tightens up but when let loose, ends of splicing and thimble are just falling apart.<br />I can't help but wonder if it can serve the purpose at all, just tossing it around for a while produced more evident deterioration to splicing with sharp ends catching fibers, separating strands and deteriorating rope's integrity further.<br /><br />I am going to have to splice the rope myself, seal the ends uniformly and secure the thimble against falling out when rope is not under tension.<br />I need some large shrink wrap so trip to electronic store is first step, plan is to feed two pieces of about 5 inches long shrink wrap onto the rope, make a clean and uniform splice, stretch the rope to seat the thimble and splice properly then seal it in that state by shrink wrap so it cannot get undone when rope is relaxed. If that doesn't do it, two crimped stainless steel rings will, one by the thimble and one at the end of splice.<br /><br />The rope itself is no better and no worse then one I can find in local hardware store, mediocre splicing job has to be fixed.<br /><br />Update:<br />Heat shrink did the trick, if you follow this trick be sure to get correct size shrink wrap, it shrinks to half of its original size, therefore you need<br />3/4 inch shrink wrap to seal 3//8 inch rope splicing.<br />Because splicing is larger in diameter then original rope, stop applying heat when there is evidence of snug confirmation to splicing contour.<br />Let this cool for few minutes then apply second piece over it, this creates fairly thick, rubber like skin over splicing that remains flexible and holds splicing against falling apart when stored loose.<br />Heat gun is essential for uniform and controlled heat application, if done right, heat shrink will hug rope's contour and prevent it from coming loose, yet remain in flexible, rubber like state, if it gets dry and hard, you got too much heat  on it and need to redo the whole thing with new piece.<br />My anchor line is now 4 star product that should have been done to higher quality standard at the factory. If there was an advantage in price, it got eaten by having to re do splicing and changing thimble to stainless steel.t application, if done right, heat shrink will hug rope's contour and prevent it from coming loose, yet remain in flexible, rubber like state, if it gets dry and hard, you got too much heat  on it and need to redo the whole thing with new piece.

B00EDMWZZ4|2|I worked the first time but ..... after that you can forget it.  I used it one time and because the lock was lightly rusted the shaft twisted out of the handle.  I'd suggest finding some much more substantial.
B00F66SO1A|5|Very satisfied
B000CGGHDG|4|No problems with the oil pan it was delivered when promised.
B006OQ3NMQ|5|See your stuff go by..  Nicely made..
B00W2XEMT8|3|Length of vents were perfect. Unfortunately the curve on the doors was too much for these, they didn't match very well. If you held the middle of the vents flush to the door, the corners were raised and vice versa. Therefore,  of course you set the middle of the vents on because there's more tape to hold on, and bend the ends down hoping the tape holds....unfortunately not. The corners on the back doors came up and the tape has gone dry.
B0055SXVLM|5|Worked out perfect. Thank you
B00UEMH5L6|5|Just finished the install on my 2015 JK, they fit like a dream. At first, I was slightly worried as there was a lift, but I simply rotated 180° and fit perfectly. Adhesive sticks well, has a clean flush look, was definitely not disappointed!  Shipped within a week too!
B00065L2D8|5|this battery clip socket is better then the picture is nice strong the wires aren't chip I would buy it again :
B002CMGWWE|5|worked great!
B000GU3KHE|5|Pretty good and quite waterproof for the price. Even after I ripped a whole in it with my tire it still keeps my Tao Tao 50cc scooter dry through the Miami rain.
B001AZVRAQ|5|Perfect way to cheer on my favorite team. Beautiful classy logo. Love  it.
B00C9Q5UUS|5|Very slick stickers.  They are definitely the best H-60 decals I've seen around.  Installation can be slightly tricky, but beyond that they are great.
B000C9S178|5|Good price, good product, quick delivery.
B00G9W9ANG|5|Works really well, compress the hell out of your gear
B00I8Y3WWS|5|Okay,the directions are a little bit off.  If you take one lift off and find alignment askew then just take the other one off and then lift your gate to proper alignment and then attach the other.  Takes less than a minute to put the two in.
B006X6OR7W|5|WORKED PERFECT. GOOD PRICE GOOD QUALITY
B0071BFOEI|5|Above my expectations, real quality. I would recommend this to everyone.
B00DSCZ0U2|5|Great price shipped very quickly.
B000COC2D2|5|Works great and i can pass emmisions with it! The cover to protect it from water is nice and it mounts in placr nicely! The throttle responce is much quicker with it im not sure if i gained any horsepower
B00FGKGI2I|5|I love this stuff! A little goes a long way. I would start out with a spray or two and let it sit over night and see how you like it. I spray a lot, because I really love this smell! I don't know what other people think a new car smells like, but it smells like this. This bottle will last you forever and a day after Jesus comes. And Jesus will say, mmm smells like new car! Buy it!
B00BFDGZV4|5|Great Products and Service!
B00QUSEFWA|5|work well thank you
B00V30J86I|1|this thing is so small, I am lucky to get a bottle of water in it and my wallet!!!!! what a joke! do not buy this product
B000BYGE3M|5|Fit 2011 Silverado 2500, a bit tricky to figure out at first had to remove the clip that was already attached to install. Price is same as wal mart but not having to go is priceless.
B004X2B9II|1|Bought this same set from O'Reillys and it too had the tape on the wrong side on the rear deflectors.<br />I have put a set of ventshades on every vehicle I have owned and never had one that AVS screwed up this bad.<br />How have they not caught this???
B000BO7CVK|5|worked great for what I was doing. the fiberglass has a lot of loose material, that made it harder to smooth and added to finish work.
B00SCXCQV8|5|These are some badass light for this price. Bright as hell, and easy to install. Would highly recommend
B004K9I3MY|5|Received excellent condition
B002E3FXB2|5|Purchased for 2008 Honda Element. Very easy installation. Perfect fit. All hardware included(nuts and bolts).
B00X8ODLRE|5|The sticker what I expected
B00F66VW96|4|It worked well, but it was difficult to reassembled.
B0002JMIEK|5|Great polish
B00DSCZ4AI|5|Lift supports were installed without any issues and worked great. Lots of power lifting door. One note as other user mentioned... for some odd reasons you need to install them up side down. No issue for me but looks odd.
B007W6O6P0|5|Great product, but did not fit my slim well Racing rims. Recommend a small diameter lug if you're buying racing rims. IE.. Fuel offroad or sparco
B004I0VEVM|5|great looking
B003ZYS8UW|5|very good, quit shipping and packaging, i have used it and my car jumped perfect. thanks.
B008R0JSU8|4|The mouting straps suck, the instructions were very difficult to understand. Everything else was good.
B00FTAZ2G8|5|great stuff
B000CMDQEI|5|I bought it to complete a set and it has worked out well for gate and auto work.
B00WIN9IYQ|4|Nice
B000GT3TKS|4|the tailgate locked fit good and was easy to install.  works perfectly.
B00QMWQJRS|4|I expected a higher quality
B00A9T28QG|4|The runs from the spray leave marks on the paint if not buffed in. Works well if you do one section of your car at a time. Otherwise will have runs on car.
B00407FUU4|5|Quality performance, correct and on time.
B002S9UYM0|5|dont bother!
B00RPRAZL0|5|I was pleased just have to  replace  the  old  one
B00PTAFCNQ|2|sturdy,  but made in china and image is poor relief, not what I anticipated.
B0028PJ10K|5|Just what I expected.
B000NZOLZ2|5|We needed a lift on our 2006 Toyota Tundra quad cab. My husband hauls his tools and materials for construction. We bought these because we could put them on ourselves and save that expense. These gave us a 3/4&#34; lift on each rear side. I was told an inch lift allows for about 800 more lbs carrying capacity. I'm not sure if that is true or not. But these seem to be doing the truck for us. And the company has great customer service.
B008P19PLQ|1|Crappy mirrors dont buy view sucks doesnt even move up
B008VLVAZE|5|These work great on our 2006 Toyota Tundra.
B00029J3ZW|5|Worked exactly as described.
B006QH56GE|1|Bought this battery now I regret it do not order batteries from any site I repeat any site u don't kno how long it's been sitting I had it 7 months and it died on me out of the blue no good
B0063JGFRY|1|Lights look great, but they are different colors. This isn't the first time this seller has had that problem. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for LEDs.
B005N53C9I|5|Very well made. Fit my Prius seats perfectly.
B004131NEY|5|Fixed the problem!
B0002LBGXC|5|good product
B00757E7LE|5|Pleased with the product.
B003NH7MQC|1|the trunk lift did not feet the car (2000 buick regal)
B002UC16HW|3|Kinda cheap quality  but it works
B00KQXC2J8|5|Fits as advertise. Seller was very helpful and prompt with responses to inquiries. Highly recommended.
B003VXRPL0|5|Helps you not boil your brake fluid!
B002OPV3C8|5|Rubber invthebgaskets was a little rough butbit worked fine. Just did the rebuild last week so far so good
B00513G82U|5|Great
B0041TQSK2|1|AUG 2015 POST: This product was similar to the one Hyundai sells for 2013 Genesis but is much cheaper. Fits perfectly. Fast delivery.  UPDATED POST JUNE 2016: Not sure how the above post from 2015 was moved from the TYC 800158P Replacement Cabin Air Filter for Hyundai Genesis to the TYC 800132P-G air filter because I'm looking at my product box and I have the correct filter. The TYC 800158P Replacement Cabin Air Filter DOES fit the 2013 Hyundai Genesis.
B00CMMZ7QG|5|These guys held up great when I laid my bike down. So good I bought another set.
B001NFC1BM|5|This is approved by Mercedes for the C320
B0071BZXXU|5|Excellent product !!
B000WJX4BQ|5|Pricey but appears to be excellent quality - easy to prepare
B00QG3GP68|3|Good product
B00FT69VXC|3|I bought this to make my 2013 Chevy Cruze seat more comfortable.  The seat has a weird dip so it presses up under the thighs and cuts off circulation.  Also, there is no lumbar support and the headrests pushes your head forward so much that driving is torturous.  The seat cover was the perfect size, but alas was not thick enough.  I even tried folding it over in different ways to maximize comfort but it just didn't work.  On the plus side it was a nice color and did not smell.  If the seat was not so flawed, the sheepskin cover would have been nice to use.  I'm still searching for a solution for my uncomfortable driver seat.
B00DTE94SI|5|:)
B00BJ7YUI6|5|nice
B004YRES30|5|Very high quality decals, excellent customer service from the seller! I would definitely purchase from the same seller again, and if I ever need it the same decals as well!
B004RCV0OM|5|Excellent. Worked exactly as advertised.
B00J43YFIW|5|full nice
B000KXLR5E|5|Good item will buy from again
B00FRQD4YQ|5|yes todo fino
B00SH33WJ8|1|Do NoT Buy they set my truck on fire!!!!! Luckily a fire extinguisher was close.
B00N071O3W|5|Fast delivers. The perfect fit, easy to install
B000C7QHLW|5|So far no problems
B00W31VMYC|2|They say,you get what you paid for<br /> Its always connecting,but it actually doesn't finish connecting because its trying to do updates
B000924QO0|5|I bought this to use on my camper to help seal the jell-coat paint and it does a great job
B00C1YI2XA|4|Wow so bright so easy to install.
B00QXGLRZM|5|Who would of thought there was 2 different switches that looked the same.  I picked up a 14 pin switch which installed had some interesting results.  Contacted switch doctor, they informed me that i picked up the wrong part.  Sent the replacement right away (18 pin switch), return the wrong switch (14 pin).  18 pin works perfectly.<br />Thanks!
B00GSAUHB8|3|Ordered this after many positive reviews for being sturdy and fitting almost all vehicles. Seemed somewhat flimsy when I got it. It DOES NOT fit a 2015 GMC Acadia! I returned and will be ordering from WeatherTech.
B000VKRQ7Y|1|This is wrong,is too big not fit in a corolla 08.this a scam.
B000EDOT8C|5|Perfect Fit, Looks and works great.
B000CIK8CA|5|The system came in a well protected box. I chose this system for my Nissan Titan after extensive on-line research. I took it to a muffler shop for professional installation. I opened the box at the shop and found a Borla cap and decals. That was a nice touch. After the installation it was start up time. It had a low end, deep bass rumble. It's not noisy except when I get on it while on the freeway. Then it's move over and let the Big Dog eat!
B00EXGRRJE|5|They work great!! I would buy again!!
B00JONUB8A|5|Nice decal - Sticks well
B007RVR2BU|4|I ordered a pair for my 2007 Prius and, with a little coaxing (these were a tiny bit longer than the original struts), I was able to install them.  So far they are working as expected.  When opening the hatch the door opens slowly at first and then picks up speed towards the end so I have to be careful not to put too much stress on the hinges by keeping a hold of the door.  Other than that it's nice to have my hatch open all the way without having to push it open manually.
B001KZDFLA|5|Fuel pump fit perfect in my 02 Sunfire 2.2. Had to wire in the new harness but was no problem.
B000GTWF0S|5|seems to be a quality cable but much smaller in diameter than stock HD.
B00DMS6JYI|1|Its not working at all
B000CEE62W|5|Works fine.  If you have trouble with it not sitcking to your garage floor.  Purchase a foot of rubber tape [[ASIN:B00DS07U02 Cofair Products (BST325) 3&#34; x 25' Butyl Seam Tape]]and use it like double sided tape.
B000IG7PMM|5|Got it fast and securely!
B000WNTYBG|5|good solid clutch engagmet
B00C912I1M|3|Started peeling off after 1 month at the corners. But it's still on (for the most part) after 2 years. VERY cute tho!
B00NP60URE|2|Doesnt work as well as I'd hoped.  After monkeying around with it for an hour, I ended up bleeding the brakes the traditional way with a long piece of clear tubing.  This will sit in the corner and take up space until I find a better use for it.
B00I2XX64E|5|Had a small white scuff and my red paint from  someone opening their door into mines. Used this product as directed and now is gone! Couldn't be happier.
B00C0WR6EY|5|Paired with porter cable or something comparable, these brushes helped spruce up with leather in need of a deep cleaning.
B007AOQUGC|5|The floor liners fit my truck perfectly. No problems with curled edges, gaps, etc. There is a  screw system that is used to keep the front mats (both driver and passenger) in place, and seems to be well suited for the job. I would order these again for other vehicles.
B000CGV7UY|5|Excellent product
B00CZM1JF6|5|excellent product. very prompt service.
B00L4V9ECY|5|Works great.
B008RCFK58|5|nice
B00CJ1C0JW|4|I bought this for my husband's Dodge Ram truck.  It looks great and he likes it.
B013CW3NA6|5|I purchased this in September 2014 and put it in my van. I also purchased a portable freezer/refrigerator and forgot to turn it off while spending the weekend with Grandma. My battery was as dead as a dollar. I pulled this out, put the cables on the battery posts, plugged it in, and immediately started my van...WOW!
B00JENQCX8|5|The part was accurate and fixed my problem. The packaging was good and protected the part during shipping.
B00BGTMCT6|5|Was received two days after ordering. Installed the same as OEM with the exception of the Black wire, simply ground this wire and install in your five wire system in place of the internally grounded five wire OEM. Works as advertised.
