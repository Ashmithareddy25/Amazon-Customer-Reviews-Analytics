6304712936|5.0|I absolutely love this film, but I was very dissapointed when I was prompted to flip the DVD to side B roughly two thirds of the way through the film.   Talk about taking the flow out of the movie.   It is new technology with an old school twist (a la 8 track tapes).   Three cheers for the makers of this DVD.
0142000655|4.0|I had always thought John Steinbeck was the author of boring books and more boring books.  After reading The Pearl, which I found quite annoying, I chose to stay away from all of Steinbeck's books.  So I was a bit hesitant in reading East of Eden at first, but after having read it I have no regrets.  John Steinbeck captures human nature like no other in his characters.  He portrays the struggles of good and evil and ignorance versus truth.  His writing contains topics the reader will ponder over for days after reading it.  My math teacher told me that Cathy Ames, the antagonist of his novel, has been said to be one of the most evil villains in all of literature history.  But don't just read this book for its colorful character developments, read it if you like to think about life.  Steinbeck has some worthwhile observations about human nature in this book.  Don't be bored this summer!  Read a book!  Read East of Eden!
B00006690F|5.0|This CD is his best yet because he is showing some of his serious side.Not only did we see em evolve on his last three albums but we saw his many personalities.He has matured greatly as an artist and an MC.GREAT CD!!!!!!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I first saw Requiem for a dream in a college auditorium at Carnegie Mellon; a bunch of college kids watching an interesting movie. By the end of it, people were on the sides throwing up, others were having mental breakdowns, and tears and a sense of shock were the rule. Requiem is not for the innocent or gentle; it is a look at a path of destruction that is most fearful in its apparent inevitability. Aranofsky makes us care about every character, only to roll them down the slippery slope. The end result is one of the most brilliant movies I can recall seeing; you can't take your eyes of the screen, no matter how much you want to. Requiem for a Dream can only be watched once though; anyone who is brave enough to watch it a second time has a strong sense masochistic desire. Aranofsky is reportedly directing the next Batman movie; if he can make the character interesting and explore the darker roots as he has in both Requiem and Pi, it should bring back interest to a flagging franchise..
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This movie has the feel of a Broadway show. I guess that's why it became one! The music really helps move the story along. Unfortunately, for so many animated movies today, the music is more of an afterthought rather than a crucial element of the story. The characters are delightful. And, Belle is an excellent role model for young girls of a strong, intelligent, and independent woman. A must for any Disney movie library!
B000063TNH|5.0|One of a pair of highly-effective \\"Drugs `R' Bad\\" movies from 2000, Traffic bears little resemblance to its more visceral partner, Requiem for a Dream.  Where Requiem appealed to emotions and raw gross-out power as junkies descend into inevitability, Traffic, based on the Channel 4 miniseries Traffik, takes a more politicized, intellectual approach to the drug problem and the so-called \\"War on Drugs.\\"  Director Soderbergh weaves three separate stories into a coherent whole: Michael Douglass' newly-appointed \\"drug czar\\" judge and his coke-addicted teenaged daughter; Catherine Zeta-Jones' innocent-wife-turned-drug-kingpin, and Oscar-winner Benicio Del Toro's Mexican police officer forced to contend with corruption in government and law enforcement on both sides of the border as everyone scrambles for a piece of the drug trade.  Traffic manages to communicate its point without self-consciousness, telling the story as a story and allowing the actors to portray subtle, three-dimensional characters instead of the usual anti-drug stereotypes.<br />Criterion managed to get their hands on the rights to Traffic for an addition to their growing collection, finally giving fans of the movie the edition they deserve.  The anamorphic widescreen transfer looks much the same as the old release, and there is still no DTS track, although the DD 5.1 makes full use of all five channels.  What Criterion added are extras.  Three commentaries, one from composer Cliff Martinez, are the appetizers.  The commentaries range from \\"remember that day of filming\\" to \\"this actually happened to X,\\" and offer a healthy balance of information and insight.  For the main course, Criterion offers no less than 25 deleted scenes, some of them short, some longer.  Round that out with a couple of featurettes, and there is enough here to keep people satisfied for a long time.  Casual buyers might balk at the price, but fans should have no problem justifying this purchase.<br />Grades:<br />Movie: A-<br />DVD: A
B00005YXZH|2.0|Yes, it is Beatlesesque. It seems contrived. It's Wilco's techno dance album. There was a double masterpiece called Being there, where there was great american songs, humable tunes you can't get out of your head, and beautiful guitar work. feedback and studio tricks cover up uncreative progressions in YHF. I admit I like war on war, for some reason its grown on me.
0142000655|4.0|The first part of the book is a lot of background on the characters.  It really helps to understand the rest of the book later on, but I feel as if I got jumped randomly without a clue from one character to a totally different character.  The random jumping is the only beef I have about this book thus the subtraction of one star.<br />The other four stars are for the plot and the development of the characters.  East of Eden is more than a mere pleasure reading book.  You can read it expecting to hear only a good story and finish feeling like you closed the door to the world.  Themes aren't as dreary as they sound like:  there's more than the theme of \\"good vs. evil\\" (actually i find that an almost nonexistent/unimportant theme).  Steinbeck plays at the choice to be either \\"good or evil\\" and the difference or value of truth or ignorance.  As a student, I think it's great to be reading a book where the theme isn't dry and overdone into another tedious assignment.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Jazz is something that is rarely seen now a days, i mean people like Diane Krall water it down and Casandra Wilson, who's voice is very deep yet doesn't fit any definition of jazz. Norah Jones<BR>has a diversity that is very rarely seen.. Ms. Jones has a blues/<BR>mellow tone to her music. Anybody who likes Remy Shand, Angie Stone, Majandra Delfino's indie jewel &quot;The Sicks&quot; or Abra Moore<BR>will like her
0375703764|5.0|I tend to be a very impatient person and at first the book was frustrating for me to read. There are passages written within passages on several pages, those that are turned sideways, and even those written upside down. However, if you can get the hang of the layout, you will be hooked. A story about a strange house and the happenings within, that I found difficult to put down. It was intriguing and psycholgically disturbing at the same time.
0064407667|1.0|The book is terrible.  It is boring and predictable, and seems like something someone with no writing skills would write for a middle school project.  I read it in thirty minutes, and was thoroughly disappointed.  I cannot believe that anyone would ever compare these books to the Harry Potter series.  Defining words in every other sentence is annoying and does not help a young readers context reading skills.
0140186395|5.0|This is probably one of Steinbeck's most compelling, realistic and multilayered novels he has ever written. Set in the picturesque Salinas Valley,East of Eden is about the story of two different families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. Themes of fraternal love are frequently emphasized and commonly allude to the biblical tale of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck eloquently intertwines the families' life experiences while creating a dynamic group of characters that shares a common thread of good and evil sentiments. Steinbeck explores new levels of heartache, jealousy and sexuality in his writing, and also sticks in brief interludes of strong political opinions against the U.S. government and World War I. His style of writing was surely inventive during his lifetime, and definitely still stands out from other novelists of the 20th century.
630460291X|5.0|First off, I wanna address this whole thing about Kevin Costner's accent.  What difference does it make at all???  If you think it makes the movie more historically accurate, well, I hate to break it to you but, you're wrong.  English people in 1194 weren't speaking in modern British accents, they were speaking in Old English, which is basically a dialect of German.  So, with that thought, the British actors were as from the historical truth as Costner with their accents.  Costner I think plays a very realistic Robin Hood, who is a lot more human than the other Robin Hoods.  He shows emotion, and in the beginning, really plays well his role of a spoiled, rich boy.  A lot of people commend Allan Rickman on his performance here, but I think he was one of the worst characters.  When talking about him, people spoke so frightenedly about him, but in every single one of his on screen moments, he was acting like a goofy weirdo.  I couldn't ever tell if what he was saying was supposed to be serious or a joke.  I think his character took away from the more serious, adventurous tone of the rest of the movie, and made Prince of Thieves seem like a parody in itself.  Not to say that he was a bad actor, I think that s a fault of the writers.  There were a few inaccuracies, like the way that the Scots dressed.  My exact first thoughts of that scene are expressed by other reviewers.  They looked more like people who would have been ravaging the Roman establishments in Britain in the 4th and 5th centuries, not like Scots of the 12th.  A lot of people have complained about the witch, and although I m not sure what her purpose was in the movie, she was entertaining, and kind of scary at the same time.  On the whole, this was a good movie that s entertaining to watch, not too far away from Braveheart.  (Although Robin's rhetoric skills are definitely much worse than William Wallace's.  I could not comprehend at all what he is trying to say while he s lecturing the people from the fallen tree.  He started off with something about being freedmen, and then ended with making weapons from the forest, I don't understand that connection.  If they are free men then while in the hell are they living in the forest?  I think that if you re free you can live wherever you want, not be forced into a &quot;haunted&quot; forest in the middle of nowhere.  And if they were already free, they wouldn't need to fight back.)
B00005JKCF|4.0|Since the sequel is already in the works, a review of \\"Spider-Man\\" almost seems superfluous. But it definitely isn't. Because, when a comic-book movie gets it right, as this one does, people should know, especially those who think of going to a big over-hyped summer blockbuster about as often as they think about going to the South Pole. <br />This is a film, of course, in which a guy slings webs, scales walls and fights a villain who looks like a cross between the Joker and the grille of a Dodge Ram. But much like Peter Jackson and the initial \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie, director Sam Raimi gets Spider-Man; he's been smitten with Spidey since he was a kid. (For his 12th birthday,we're told, his mom painted a Spider-Man mural on his bedroom wall.) <br />To Raimi, making Spider-Man isn't interchangeable with making \\"The Scorpion King\\" or \\"Men In Black II\\" or any other big-budgeted summer movie. That fan's pure devotion coupled with Raimi's considerable directorial flair (remember the \\"Evil Dead\\" movies or \\"A Simple Plan\\"?) makes the movie far better than you might expect. <br />For anyone who hasn't been reading Marvel Comics since the early '60s (when Stan Lee created the character), Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a teen geek who lives in Queens with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris). Peter's the kind of guy who gets kicked around by the other kids for no particular reason, the kind of guy with a hopeless crush on the girl next door, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst, with flame-red hair). <br />On a school field trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically mutated spider. The next morning, he no longer needs his glasses; his abs look like they were carved out of The Rock. He soon discovers he has other powers, too: He can crawl up walls and spin webs that make leaping over tall buildings in a single bound uneccessary. He simply swings though Manhattan's concrete canyons. (Special effects evaluation: very, very good but not always thrilling.) <br />When tragedy strikes his family, Peter stops fooling around with his new powers and starts fighting crime. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the tycoon dad of Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco who played James Dean on TV), is experiencing a super-power make-over, too. In a Jekyll -and- Hyde scenario, the good Osborn turns into the bad Green Goblin, who cruises around on a glider wreaking havoc and trying to destroy Spider-Man. <br />Okay, it's not Tolstoy. It's not even Tolkien. But it is a picture jam-packed with swinging action scenes, spiffy spider jokes and an unforced earnestness that never becoes corny or tongue-in-cheek. \\"Spider-Man\\" doesn't go for the retro-camp of \\"Dick Tracy\\" or the brooding hipness of \\"Batman.\\" True, the Spidey/Green Goblin battles are generic and somewhat repetitive, which can make the movie feel long. But the picture has an an energy and a self-confidence that give it a terrific movie-movie feel. <br />Even the acting is better than it usually is in this kind of flick. Dafoe brings some of his downtown theater training to his role, especially in the scenes where the innocent Osborn is talking with his evil alter identity. (at one point, he chats with The Green Goblin's mask which hangs from a wing-back chair.) Dunst, whose work in the current \\"The Cat's Meow\\" proves she doesn't have anything to prove to anyone, puts some spunk and integrity in her admittedly limited role. <br />Still, it all comes down to Maguire who is flat-out terrific. A lot of fuss surrounded his casting: what's the sensitive kid from \\"The Ice Storm\\" and \\"The Cider House Rules\\" doing as a beloved comic-book hero? But Raimi said that he didn't need to look for Spider-Man; he needed to find Peter Parker. Maguire, with his slightly crooked grin, his mild yet laser-sharp gaze and his crackly, choked-up voice turns out to be the perfect choice. He knows we root for poor, shy Peter as much as we do for Spidey in all his wall-crawling splendor. Maguire brings a pensiveness to the part as well a goofy likability and an unabashed intelligence. When things get totally outlandish, he's our touchstone. <br />The best advice Uncle Ben gives to his nephew is \\"With great power comes great responsibility.\\" Sam Raimi knows exactly what that means.
B000003C4K|5.0|Listening to BONDED BY BLOOD one might have expected Exodus to go on to become as big as Metallica, Megadeth or Slayer. Certainly this debut album is about as good as the first albums by those bands, or better. Big success apparently wasn't in the cards, but this record is still a powerful one. Ripping through nine aggressive compositions in forty minutes, Exodus were clearly of the \\"fast n' brutal\\" school of metal. The twin-guitar riffing brings to mind a combination of Metallica's KILL 'EM ALL and Slayer's REIGN IN BLOOD. Fast tempos, bucketloads of riffs. Lyrically, Exodus apparently wanted to scare us with their tales of unholy violence, but whenever the words go a little over the top, the music is solid enough to keep things credible. I think the obvious highlights are the title track, 'A Lesson in Violence' and 'Piranha', but all the songs are enjoyable. BONDED BY BLOOD is one of the essential thrash debuts.
0312954468|1.0|I can't stand arrogant people, this is why the arrogant first person writing stile made me give up on this book before finishing it. The historical background of this book is as thin as air in the stratosphere. If mr Smith had taken even the slightest interest in ancient Egypt he would have written a better book. Pyramids by Terry Pratchett is more serious on ancient Egypt than this book.
B000002KFJ|5.0|If you only have enough cash for one CD and are in need of something Sabbath, look no further than Sabotage. This 1975 album has it all: Heavy, bone-crushing riffs, quiet, pensive interludes, and all-out adrenaline surged psychotic bliss. Ozzy is at his 70's best, as is the writing and arranging. Tony Iommi peaked as a guitarist with this effort as well, and the one-two punch of Bill Ward and Geezer Butler leaves you hungry for more. You must do yourself a favor and give this disc a listen...it may very well be the greatest rock album of all time, I kid you not.
B00005JKED|3.0|This movie was both powerful and disturbing.  That being said, I would never watch it again.  The violence, the language, and the wanton disregard for the sanctity of human life is appalling.  While it may be realistic, and the movie may be well-done, I cannot endorse it for viewing.  It makes me sick.
0140434089|5.0|First off, I think I should let anyone reading this review know that I am a high school student.  But I don't believe that this fact impacted the way that I felt about the book.  I have always been a fan of mystery novels and this one was definately one of the best of its genre.  The book follows a huge, yellow diamond stolen by a British officer from an Indian sultan's treasury.  50 years later, the officer leaves the gem to his neice, Rachel Verinder, upon his death.  The gem is then stolen from Miss Verinder on the same night she receieves it.  The story follows the search for the truth of the missing stone.  But the best part about the novel is that it is told in first person narritive, by several individuals who played important roles in the story.  Wilkie Collins does a masterful job at pulling off this writting technique by giving each of the narrators their own character, from which they portray the story as they perceived it to have happened.  Each narrator provided deep insight into the other characters; some of whom are described from several different and sometimes intentionally conflicting perspectives.  The trouble, for a reader, with trying to solve an average mystery novel is that you can be influenced by the narrator's views.  Wilkie Collins allows the reader to see the events and characters through the eyes of different narrators, giving the reader many perspectives to look at and allowing the reader to decide for themselves what is really happening and who people really are.  One of the complaints about Collins' novel is that he is at times long winded, but I found the story simply to be incredibly detailed, enjoyable, and beautifully written.  Collins' also provides an accurate portrayal of the opinions of the Victorians during the imperialist age.  Overall, I would reccomend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good mystery, especially one wiht a twist due to the unusual style of narration.

B00004U2HK|5.0|what can I say - it's timeless - fantastic family movie
B00003CXI1|4.0|The movie was so great that I couldnt wait till the DVD came out, but it was a horrible purchase, the DVD would only play the movie once and then it wouldnt do it anymore, the deleted scenes were nothing like I expected, and it wont even read the disks anymore. WB made them [poorly]and there have been tons of complaints that I have seen on websites. I advise ppl not to by this for a few months till they start making them in better quality!
0553208845|5.0|This book has a played a huge influence on my life.  Though I read it an entire year ago, it still continues to influence me as I travel down my own spiritual path.  Often I will remember a particular passage that made no sense to me at the time and it will suddenly become perfectly clear and shed everything in a new, shimmering light.  Siddhartha should be the kind of book that affects each person differently, just as each person's spiritual journey is different, therefore I cannot really tell you much about the meaning of the book.  Indeed, Hermann Hesse's philosophical ponderings, in the same way, differ from mine and everyone else's, because they are his own.  However, Hesse has a unique insight that often has helped me to understand my own thoughts and sometimes even explains for me thoughts i couldn't quite pin down.  Hesse has become my favorite author for this reason; though his novels can sometimes be rather hard to plow your way through, since they are translated from another language and can be awkward and don't flow as beautifully as i am sure they do in German, it is well worth plowing your way through for the fruits you harvest in the end from his immortal wisdom.  Siddhartha, I believe, is also a good introduction to some of the more complex compositions of Hermann Hesse.  Definitely read this book.
038533558X|5.0|I read alot of mysteries and I'm really tired of guessing the &quot;real killer&quot; 50 pages into them.

0790734850|2.0|L.A. Confidential revives the glorious tradition of the film noir genre, or at least it tries.  It stars some of the most famous actors of the last few years, but none of them are interesting.  Basically it is the story of an honest cop caught in a corrupt police department.  Sound familiar?  A certain actor by the name of Al Pacino starred in a certain movie called 'Serpico'.  There are numerous fights and shootouts distracting the audience, making them forget the jumbled mess of the story.  'L.A. Confidential' jumps from one small story to the next without any kind of coherency.  There seemed to be no focus at all .  A love triangle exists between Bud White and Kim Basinger, but it is flat and contrived, and the only thing Basinger is good at is looking pretty.  All of a sudden the honest cop has sex with her.  Why in the world did he do this and what purpose does it serve?  I know what purpose it serves; it keeps the audience awake and distracts them even more.  An implausable shootout happens in the end where all the good guys survive and bad guys die.  And in the end the pretty girl kisses the hero.  Whoa, talk about a modern cinematic masterpiece.
B00005QZWI|5.0|brillant work! i listen to this every day. it really captures the movie. i enjoyed the movie but the soundtrack is even better!
044022165X|5.0|i loved this book!! it was soooo good! i thought that it started out a little bit slow, but i was uplifted after about 75 pages.  The climax was the best part, when Rudy Baylor, a fresh new lawyer that just got his license and just passed the bar exam, went to his first trial.  The result of the trial was surprising and wonderful.  The book is very good and presents many twists and turns rather than a predictable ending.  This book, along with the firm, keep me hungry for many more John Grisham books!!! i love this book! it truely was a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i would rate it a ten on a scale of 1 to 5!!!!

B000067DNC|5.0|Fans of \\"Stargate SG-1\\" will tell you that the show's second season is easily one of the best. In the wake of Apophis' attack on Earth, the show kicked into high-gear and never looked back! Sam's life would be changed forever; Daniel would discover a dark secret about his wife; and SG-1 would meet two of their greatest allies, and see the defeat of one of their greatest enemies.<br />Season Two includes \\"The Fifth Race,\\" regarded by many (myself included) as the show's best episode.<br />MGM has been slow in releasing the series onto Region 1 DVD, but hopefully it won't take another year and a half to see Season Three! The Season One DVD set is outstanding, with top-notch audio and video transfers, and tons of rewatchability. Extra features are slim for Season One, but expect them to become more and more plentiful as the show's DVD releases progress.
6302968135|5.0|I happened to miss this film nearly ten years ago.  Today I<BR>watched it for the first time.  The movie was a fine tribute to the Hispanic community, and the joy and the pain of living in a world controlled by the white man.  The acting was good and the story captured my imagination.  The brothers had the passion!   The film has much to say about people of color, many of them<BR>poor, seeking justice in this world.  It's about Justice.
B00006690F|5.0|This is definitely his most heartfelt album yet, and he's on a totally different level compared to the Marshall Mathers LP. He seems to be talking more about his life, and the things that make him happy, sad.... I still say he's a lyrical genius, and there's no one in hip-hop right now as dope as him. DVD was a little dissapointing, and I expected a little more content on it. But overall, this album is definitely worth getting.
B000068TPN|5.0|This review is for the actual theatrical version since I do not have the dvd yet.<br />I hate communism as I am sure all of us here in the USA do.<BR>So when I say that I love this movie, please do not take it to mean that I love violence, war, or especially communism!<br />For understandable reasons, most Vietnamese (especially 40yr + age) will not even give ANY Vietnam war movie a look. My parents and my mother/father-in-laws never gave \\"We Were Soldiers\\" a chance simply because they HATE any Vietnam war movies. <br />The reason I love this movie is because it is definitely \\"Braveheart\\" material.<BR>I cared a lot for the characters in this movie. I felt sorry for the people involved. Of course, I hate the communists and their believes and their cruelty to the Vietnamese and to anyone who opposes them. But I felt sorry for the soldiers who had to fight in the war (ANY WAR).<br />So the mains reason I love this movie include the following:<BR>1) It made me care a lot for the characters. There are funny moments, sad moments, exciting moments. It has good acting and good characterization. <BR>2) It has a lot of action and special effects (good setting.<BR>3) It has a good story (good plot).<BR>4) and the GOOD GUYS won in this movie (good climax and resolution) !!!!!<BR>I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd.<BR>...
B00005JKCF|5.0|This is truly an example of how special effects have grown in recent years. The actors do an excellent job of not making the story look campy. Yes, the plot is a little thin, but I really enjoyed watching Spiderman fly through the city.<br />I loved the animated version of Spiderman as a child. This is a great introduction to what will hopefully be a great series of Spiderman movies to come.
B00003CXI1|2.0|\\"Harry Potter\\" is a decent movie with good acting, good visual effects and weak-but-interesting storytelling. My concern HERE is the DVD packaging. Having the opportunity to release some fine behind-the-scenes material, Warner Bros. has really messed up this time. Instead, they've released a stupid kiddie-Video Disc. The only safe-havens on this disc are an interview featurette (With the filmakers commenting on this film as well as the sequel, which will also star Kenneth Branagh), theatrical trailers, and deleted scenes that I can't even find yet! Take a hint, and get your kids the VHS. Trust me, you'll save some money for a good reason! Movie Grade: B+; DVD Grade: D+
0440224764|5.0|Simply fantastic is the best way to describe the 8th novel from John Grisham. The hero of this exhilarating thriller is Patrick Lannigan a lawyer who fled the country after faking his death. It all started when he learned that the firm he worked for was cutting him out of a major deal. Patrick lashes out by stealing the money, faking his death and relocating to Sao Paulo. Years later he is found and his existence is shattered. After a night of terror and torture, Patrick is extradited to the U.S.A where he turns to his old friend Sandy to represent him. Patrick could be facing jail time, but a dark secret from the firm could be his ticket to freedom. As with every other Grisham book the characters are meaty and not just some cardboard cut out. The book is never dull and has a great twist at the end that is worth waiting for. Grisham's finest hour.

When you combine the lyrics and the music it's magic.  It's about the same time length as two tracks.<br />Overall this CD is great, it will have you wanting more.  It is very successful on both parts of the world.  Just goes to show you that real music can make a come back and you don't have to wear alittle of nothing to make it.<br />Well I hope this was helpful. Go and buy this album and support a real artist
B00001U0E1|5.0|Brimming with add-ons, 'Shakespeare' gets the deluxe treatment on this disc.  There are interviews with cast and crew, including Oscar-winning costume designer Sandy Powell, who strived to give the clothes a lived-in look;  a backgrounder on the Bard himself;  deleted scenes, among them a slightly different ending, in which a shipwrecked Gwyneth Paltrow is greeted by Americans (of the English-speaking variety);  and best of all, a vivid transfer of the clever, charming film itself.
044022165X|4.0|When people are diagnosed with deadly diseases it is only natural that the insurance company should cover the costs of the treatment. When the insurance company refuses to pay what do you do? In The Rainmaker the 6th book from best-selling author John Grisham a young idealistic attorney named Rudy Baylor who isn't yet licensed to practice law (He hasn't yet written his bar exam) takes on a case that seems simple enough but then explodes like a wildfire. Great White Insurance is a fraudulent company that preys on the poor and uneducated. They offer insurance for a minimal monthly fee and then refuse to pay the benefits. As Rudy tries the case with the help of an associate (who has failed the bar exam more then three times) they have no idea of knowing just what kind of corporation they are up against. Another story involving a battered wife that falls for Rudy is prominent in the story as is Rudy's relationship with the elderly woman who has rented him a room in her garage. Grisham has a way with making everything that happens in his book seem plausible and not mundane. He writes about interesting characters that you feel connected to. For this book Grisham is once again at the top of his form creating a thriller with a real moral plot as the main plot device.
0140186395|3.0|While I did find this novel enticing, enjoyable, and a fulfilling read, I did at times find East of Eden by John Steinbeck somewhat unorganized and hard to understand. For a majority of this novel, I couldn't put it down. Themes of good vs. evil as well as love become apparent to the reader. Characters are well developed and liked by the audience. Unfortunately, it was difficult to keep track of what or who you were reading about. Steinbeck would go for a chapter on one character in one setting and then completely jump to another family or character in another city. It was in the hope of the reader that these two families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks, would one day cross paths. In many ways I found this novel much like a soap opera you would find on television. There is Cathy, a whore of a mother to the sons of Adams children, Caleb and Aron. However, it is unknown to the audience if they children are even Adams, possibly being his brother Charles who Cathy slept with at one point in the novel. I found myself getting so in depth into one part of the novel and just when it got good or revealed a fact about a character, Steinbeck would go and change everything all around. If you are looking for a quick read, this isn't your novel. If you are ready to maybe read sections over a few times to understand what is going on then this is your novel. Steinbeck is an amazing author however maybe this isn't his best work.
0812550706|5.0|On the surface \\"Ender\\" reminds me all of those genius dorks in I knew senior year.  Then after I was about halfway through the book I thought that I couldn't care less if Gaft and his minions were successful in turning Ender into a homicidal killing machine.  Then about halfway through the book I started to really appreciate the clear Machiavellian simplicity with which Card has crafted his universe.  So basically this book has 2 stories, one on the surface for kids 10-12 and another for older people.  It really works on all levels, but don't just take my word for it, go read \\"Ender's Game\\" for yourself.
B00003CXI1|3.0|My children loved this movie just as much on DVD as in the theater, we did not notice that some of the sorting hat scene was cut, as stated by other reviewers.  Our frustration came with the special features, the software was hard for our computer to run ( there were 3 or 4 different software programs to install )  To see deleted scenes you have to go through the paces, but our computer crashed every time we tried to use the software on the DVD.  We DO meet the system requirements and don't usually have trouble with new software.  So we feel like we really didn't get the extras, hence the 3 star rating.  We are curious if others had trouble with the software.  Small children would probably not be able to navigate this DVD on their own at all.  Bummer.  Still a good movie for the kids.
B000002KGT|5.0|With the release of Rumours the second album released from the new and more popular &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; it was clear that the band had grown and matured since we last had heard them. While the album was made during a troubling time in the lives of many of the band's members, (Relationships were ending) the album never suffers as a result. Every song is masterful in their own way. Stevie has allot to offer ranging from the rockin &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; to the more pop sounding &quot;Dreams&quot;. Christine Mcvie is at her best with pop flavoured hits such as &quot;You Make Loving Fun\\", but she reaches her peak with the wonderful ballad &quot;Songbird&quot; played with only a piano and her wonderful voice. The band is in full force during &quot;The Chain&quot; one of the best songs on the album and a killer when heard live. Sure the production is basically more of the same from the last album but the production is slicker and grittier. It won the 1977 Album of the year at the Grammy Awards and it was well deserved. <BR>Best Song On The Album: Songbird

0440180295|5.0|If there is a single book I believe everyone in the world should read, for some reason, that would be this one. The Tralfamadorians are the epitome of intellectual thought, and Vonnegut forces the reader to examine his own beliefs on the nature of time, death, and what it means to be a human. Vonnegut is my hero!
1573225517|4.0|Got the book because I'd seen and enjoyed the movie. But, then, I'm a total hobag for Cusack (and his funny and charming sister, Joan). Alas,I put the book down about 80% through it and have not picked it up since. Go figure. I think this is a &quot;chick book&quot; for guys. I could not relate to the character, which I suspect is the main charm of the book. The audience (and rightfully so) for this book is, I assume, young men with large record collections (and the men who would love to have large record collections). But, then, I don't expect those same young men to like books similar to this whose target demographic is jaded women.<br />However, that said, Hornby's dialogues are real, his descriptions of the settings vivis and his explorations into human feeling are  deeply realized.
B000002LFZ|4.0|. Greatest Hits: After 13 years and six albums, it seemed the perfect time for the new &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; to release their first greatest hits package and for the most part it is well worth a listen. Having established themselves as a blues band in the late 60's early 70's they had yet to establish themselves in the United States until they released the more pop oriented &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; in 1975 which introduced Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham to the group of which also consisted of John Mcvie, Christine Mcvie and Mick Fleetwood. Since then they have gone through allot including a 5 year hiatus between albums before staging a massive comeback with 1987's &quot;Tango In The Night&quot;. However Lindsey Buckingham was only persuaded to make the album, but left the group after doing so and was replaced by fellow guitar players, Rick Vito and Billy Burnette. They can be heard on two new cuts on the hits album a Christine Mcvie song called &quot;As Long As You Follow&quot; as well as a Stevie Nicks song called &quot; No Questions Asked&quot; both of which are good additions to the Mac repertoire. Overall the album is good with hits ranging from &quot;Rhiannon&quot; to &quot;Hold Me&quot;, however one of my favourites &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; is missing from the collection as are the b - side rarity \\"Silver Springs\\" and \\"Gold Dust Woman\\". Still that doesn't mean that this album is in anyway bad.  <BR>Best song on the album: Sara
B000065U1N|5.0|Being in the military and having read the book several times, I was extremely pleased at how closely Scott followed the actual events.  This is truly one of the best war films ever produced and should be viewed by everyone.  This movie is a testament to all those who fought and died in Somalia in 1993 and should not be overlooked.  Due to time compression in telling the story, one character sometimes did what three different individuals did in actuality.  However, this certainly does not detract from the overall main point of the movie: that American servicemen bravely fought and died for their country.  I have pre-ordered my DVD and strongly recommend this movie to any one.
0140186395|5.0|This is an excellent book but i would not recommend it to the faint of heart. It deals with many issues of human nature such as the struggle with sexuality, good versus evil, and stories from the Bible. I found it fascinating how well it coincided with how humans work. To those of you afraid that it might be a dark, depressing book: it really isn't that bad! Steinbeck's descriptions of the Salinas Valley are lovely and the characters in the novel experience happiness. But that is all intertwined with many other events and happenings . . .I won't tell what. I hope that those of you who purchase East of Eden enjoy it!
B000002UAR|5.0|I really hate to use the term &quot;pop-music&quot; but thats what it is. It may be pop-music but this album blows all other &quot;pop&quot; albums out of the water. Actually this album created most of the music we hear today...the good stuff of course.<BR>This is definately the first mature Beatle album. You've got a little bit of everything on this album and that is what makes it so good. You've got George singing about their money woes on &quot;Taxman&quot;. Ringo belts out the fun and creative lyrics of &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Some of Paul's best written songs are on this album, like the romantic love song &quot;Here, There, and Everywere&quot;, and the upbeat &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot;. Of course you can't forget the sad yet slightly weird &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. <BR>It is Lennon who really shines on this album though. My two favorite songs on the album are &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; and &quot;And  Your Bird Can Sing&quot;. Then Lennon takes music a step further on &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, possibly the first true experimental music in popular music.<BR>Many may say that Sgt. Pepper or the White Album surpasses Revolver as far as concept albums go, but, in my opinion, Revolver is better because it is their first album to have great music, lyrics, and production all on one disc. Plus, it is an album that can be played straight through without any skipping over songs, each song holds its own.<BR>Revolver is  a masterpiece that everyone who loves any kind of music should have. This album is inspirational even  to today's musicians, who owe a great debt to Revolver.
B000002KD5|4.0|When a new line-up was announced for the UK band Fleetwood Mac it was unclear whether the new line-up would be able to finally parlay their Success overseas in The United States. They did finally find success with the top 10 hit &quot;Rhiannon&quot; as well hits ranging from Christine Mcvie's &quot;Over My Head&quot; to a cover of Lindsey and Stevie's &quot;Crystal&quot; from their 1973 album &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; which did so poorly their record company dropped them. Other hits like &quot;Landslide&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; are also featured on this album which marks a turning point for the band who had  no idea just how big they would become.  A good solid album and a must have for the collection.
B000003C2U|5.0|This is not only my favorite death metal album, this was my awakening!. this album changed my life forever. i've been a death's fan for more than 12 years now, very much since they released spiritual healings and let me tell you by the time this got out i was incredibly impressed.....the album's technicity is  just completely something else. the musical writting and composition is so intelligent that even today ultratechnical metal bands use human as a source of inspiration and technicity. chuck's lyric's are probably some of the must imaginative and intellectual  ever to be put down into music. his musical inventiva was layed down by a very emotional,spiritual, complex and versatil imagination.....that can only come from love and  passion for music greatness. every song stands completely by it self, every shop is clockwork orange. the gathering of some of the must incredible individuals in music virtuosity ( steve digiorgio, sean reinart and paul masdival)make this album a hall of famer. i will always remember u chuck for everything you taught me, musically and spiritually.  ........your music will always be a source of inspiration, not only musically but personaly, god have you under his grace.you will be deeply miss and your albums depply overplayed by those who really appreciate true and intelligent heavy metal virtuosity. r.i.p.
B0000024JN|5.0|Sure it was overplayed in the 80's, but if you just listen to it, without all of the baggage from the time it was recorded and played (to death) it is really a great album.  Every song grooves, the samples and perfect.  It is great to hear them develop their own styles throughout their careers.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I feel like this is one of those debuts that starts a loyalty with the listener. If you like this kind of hipster music, should get it.
0440214041|5.0|It is rare for a book to be equally as brilliant as the one that preceded it, but that is exactly what happens with John Grisham's latest thriller about a law student running for her life. The Pelican Brief refers to the title of a legal brief written by a law student named Darby Shaw who writes a brief explaining who she thinks may have assassinated two Supreme Court justices. When her mentor / lover gets a hold of it the wrong people learn of it's existence and now they must have Darby killed because her brief is dead on perfect. Turning to a reporter named Gray Grantham Darby must go on the run and expose the truth. Darby is a well-written and developed character and so is Gray who is smartly written and not just a stereotypical black man. Full of action and intrigue the Pelican Brief is a fantastic read.

B00005N9CV|1.0|I followed the hype and bought it. Big mistake. Hellooooo there! Not only is it painfully academic, it's also plain boring. If you're into lounge look on Lisa Ekdahl's side. If you love jazz just listen to Kurt Elling. When HE does a ballad album there's more than meets the ear...
0517122707|3.0|Funny in parts.  Weird in parts.  Sometimes I asked myself why I was reading this; other times I felt compelled to read more.  Can't see that it could be called &quot;great literature&quot; but at the same time I found myself thinking about the characters when I wasn't reading.  Strange.
0440213525|5.0|With the one two sucker punch of \\"The Firm\\" and The Pelican Brief\\" it wasn't surprising to learn that Warner Bros Pictures paid allot of money to adapt the next Grisham novel into a movie. Thing is he hadn't even written it yet. The 4th book from the magnificent author is a suspenseful story about a child in danger and a female lawyer who must protect his rights and ultimately his life. Mark and his little brother Ricky were sharing a forbidden cigarette in a weedy lot outside of Memphis when they first saw the shiny black Lincoln pull up. Inside a man is trying to kill himself, but Mark keeps stopping that from happening. When he is caught and dragged inside the car Mark is scared, but the lawyer does not harm him. He kills himself with a single gunshot wound to the head. His last words are what make Mark a wanted man as a shady District Attorney Roy Foltrig tries to pry the vital information that Mark has locked inside his brain. Mark hires a lawyer for one U.S. dollar named Reggie love a lawyer all of six years who takes his case and then ultimately endangers them both in a last ditch gamble to end the terror. The films pulse is maddening and the suspense is relentless as are the film's villain's, members of a mob family determined to kill Mark to keep him quiet. The novel takes a big risk in centring the story around an 11-year-old child, but it pays off big time. A great thriller.

He articulates the technical and artistic details with both cast and crew extremely easily.<br />Having directed some of the STTNG series epsiodes he certainly got his feet wet in the department of special effects photography.<br />There are great funny moments, lots of drama and another time-travel story that is very intriguing and detailed in its goal to save mankind once again. The score once again in my all time favorite, Jerry GOldsmith - and does he set the mood!<br />We have th eBorg to thank for this movie. Constantly trying to assimilate the universe...they make one more attempt to their fatality. They are the most enticing aliens since the Talosians of the original Trek. Alfie Woodard and James Cromwell put in very good performaces.<br />The finally is extremely good with the evil Borg Queen taunting Data to do the dirty deed - in many ways.<br />This is film is fun and adventurous for all. A must!<br />\\"Make It So!\\"

B000002L9Y|4.0|5. Tango In The Night: With the release of &quot;Tango In The Night&quot; in the summer of 1987, it marked a stellar return for the band that hadn't released anything since 1982's &quot;Mirage&quot;. While Lindsey Buckingham did not tour with the band he did produce the record with long-time Mac collaborator Richard Dashut and they done a good job for the most part. Big Love and Everywhere are the only real misfires (Better heard live on &quot;The Dance&quot;) The tracks are all over the map with a great Mac song called &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; and another good one called &quot;Little Lies&quot;. Stevie succeeds with &quot;Welcome To The Room... Sara&quot; a song with a profound lyrics and great rhythm. Lindsey even gets his trademark Guitar solos with the albums title track which features a great guitar solo from Lindsey. Unfortunately it was to be his last Mac Album.    .
B00000ILBK|2.0|Insurreection for lacks two things:<br />1) An interesting story and,<br />2) A convincing enemy. F. Murray Abhram is a great actor, but this role, couple with his &quot;holding back&quot; may have made this movie fall a little short.<br />Again the film is filled with cute scenes and certain actions that interesting. But overall, the director (Johnathan Frakes again (Commander WIlliam Riker) didn't seem to have as much fun in this one.<br />The most ridiculous thing in it was that in the 24th century when you have a spaceship that is five football fields in length and the size of New York, is that your steering apparatus for this gigantic ship is a JOYSTICK! Yiches!<br />Anyway, after you buy all the other films, this is the second to last to by of the Star Trek movies. (The last being &quot;Star Trek V:The Final Frontier&quot;)<br />Hopefully movie number 10 (Due out in fall 2002.) will be much better. Take a chance on this one.

This book will give you intense digital color photography (like no other book), while showcasing the color in lifestyle concepts to spark your imagination. <br />For retailers, interior designers, graphic designers, and others who depend on the importance of color: it's a great reference read, to get you on the right track. It's hard to go wrong with a Pantone book, they've pretty much written THE book on color. Nobody's more official... MCM
6305350205|1.0|As you have read above, this is the worst of the 9 (Soon to be 10)films. It has some very cute and short sentimental moments in it and a great senic opening of Yosemite National Park, plus a gorgeously wonderful score by my favorite composer Jerry Goldsmith - but - overall, no story, no story, no story. Did I mention no story?<br />Shatner should have not let the producers take over. When I read his memorars about the shooting of this film, Shatner says the movie was completely different. It was budget cuts and studio pressures made it into something it was never intened to be.<br />If that's true, then cudos to Shatner, but as a film....&quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; was much, much, much more entertaining. Sorry Bill!

I was stunned, amazed, entranced, shocked, excited and thrilled by the colors, lights and sounds.<br />For the next 5 years I was Logan and all my friends were Sandmen.This movie is Michael Anderson (the Director)at his best. An extremely inventive and innovative film for its time. This movie has a great story, great perfomrnaces and great sets and props. Even the model city is stunning. (Built on a 25 foot by 35 foot table top on the stages of MGM.<br />Colorful and almost magical. It was the very first &quot;Special Acadamy Award&quot; for Special Effects and diservedly so! Michael York and Jenny Augutter are wonderful and the late Richard Jorden was the perfect villan.<br />The best performace is the &quot;Old Man&quot; played by Peter Ustinov. Rosce Lee Brown plays the predesor to C-3PO and Lt, Cmdr. Data. The costumes are simple but unique.<br />This is a must to own.. The DVD commentary is fantastic! And for me, it brought back a lot of memories!

006441034X|5.0|This book, in a word, is fun. It's charming, funny, and has great characters. If you want a book that's really fast-paced and full of action,though,don't pick this one. It's not a story about magic with  big, impressive magical battles and that type of stuff, it's a story about people that happen to use magic. This, I think, is one of my favorite things about it. Instead of focusing on how much power the characters have and how much different they are from everyone else, DWJ focuses on how human the characters are. They do the same things everyone does and they aren't perfect. I think it's the only fantasy I've ever read in which the title characer complains about his hair color and gets a hangover. But hey, it makes him seem more human and that's a good thing.<br />If you like to laugh and you want a fantasy that isn't dark and heavy, but that doesn't seem like it was written for 7 year olds, then read this. You will find it quite enjoyable.

William Dafoe as the Green Goblin was one of the best casting ideas ever because he made the Goblin seemed like one of the most maniacal super-villian our friendly-neighborhood Spider-Man has ever faced!

0385495323|4.0|I will be the first to admit that I only have a passing interest in the field of cryptography.  In addition, I am not an expert in any of the related disciplines: mathematics, computer science, linguistics, etc.  However, as a libertarian concerned with the issues of personal liberty and privacy, my curiosity in the subject matter surfaced when I saw this book at the store.<br />With this book, Simon Singh has weaved a captivating account on the importance of and the development of cryptography over time.  He portrays the evolution of the science as a see-saw battle between the code makers and the code breakers.  He drives the point home by introducing key events in history (e.g. execution of Mary Queen of Scots, WWI, WWII) that were severely affected by the security, or lack thereof, of private communications.  He ties these historical events together with explanations and anecdotes on the development of the particular encryption methodologies employed and the weaknesses/obstacles that led to their downfall.  Of special interest, he highlights in his writings the contributions of key figures in the development of crytography that would otherwise be historical footnotes due to the secrecy of their work (e.g. GCHQ's development of modern public key cryptography). <br />In the final section of the book, Singh spends some time speculating on the future direction of cryptography.  If history is any indicator, it is only a matter of time before what is considered &quot;unbreakable&quot; will also be decoded.

B0000631QG|3.0|During the last 15 month or so, Porcupine Tree's record labels decided to release a string of albums and EP singles, including two compilation, limited editions, and some obscure material, so it has become increasingly difficult even for dedicated fans to follow the band's course. I'm not quite sure if Steve Wilson is happy about the cash-in strategy of his former record labels (he has recently signed to Atlantic Records), but I certainly appreciate the fact that so many  PT records are now made available for a wider public. The sticker on the front cover of Metanoia&quot; tells us that the improvisations on this disc, which vary in length from 4 ½ to more than 14 minutes, were recorded live during the Signify&quot; studio sessions, so my expectations were quite high; firstly, Signify&quot; was a magical album from start to finish and features some of the band's best work, secondly, I've always been a fan of the band's live sound, and thirdly, I find it interesting to listen to a work in progress. Great conditions, so what went wrong? Although PT are certainly no strangers to the idea of jamming along in concert and studio - with excellent results as documented on the Coma Divine&quot; live album and the b-sides collection Recordings&quot; - the approach on Metanoia&quot; often feels very monotonous, with minimal variation in arrangements, tempos, and moods throughout the 65-minute disc. Sure, the musicianship on Metanoia&quot; is excellent as always since Barbieri's warm electronic undercurrents mesh effortlessly with Maitland's crisp drumming, Edwin's slap bass, and Wilson's sonic excursions, but it's the lack of recognizable tunes and the high level of repetition that sabotages many of the tracks here; in contrast to other PT improvisations, like Cure for optimism&quot; and Untitled&quot;, much of Metanoia&quot; is entirely unmemorable and comes across as a series of rather pointless ambient interludes and meandering noodlings. In my opinion, the three-part suite Mesmer&quot; is the most engaging material on this disc, alternating between tightly constructed, rhythm-oriented parts and wonderfully atmospheric sections which primarily derive from laid-back guitar textures and spacey synth sounds. The 13-minute Mesmer III/Coma Divine&quot; is a little more experimental than its companion pieces and works particularly well as it moves from a somewhat chaotic and harrowing collage of vocal samples to disturbing guitar atmospherics (not a million miles away from the solo work of Robert Fripp) and finally to beautifully evolving synth/guitar textures with some de-facto melodies. It's not quite in the same league as PT's best material, but respectable `chill-out music' nontheless. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the 14-minute Metanoia I/Intermediate Jesus&quot;, which grows stale very quickly because there's no dynamic movement in the instrumentation. The shorter piece Door to the river&quot; also repeat the formula of ponderous anti-rhythms and directionless guitar/bass snippets without noticeable changes, while the 11-minute Metanoia II&quot; and Insignificance&quot; manage to introduce a few nice guitar effects and faster rhythms towards the end. However, there simply isn't enough going on here to make this album (unlike many other PT releases) a regular in my CD player: Too much filler exists, and although the sound quality is remarkably mature for a bunch of half-finished recordings, there's very little here which displays Wilson's songwriting capabilities and his flair for dramatic compositions and deeply delivered lyrics. Thus, Metanoia&quot; is probably left best for converted PT fans who favor the band's early, spaced-out phase to the more song-oriented format that would dominate their recent records. My advice: Make sure that you own every other commercially available PT album before buying Metanoia&quot;.part suite Mesmer&quot; is the most engaging material on this disc, alternating between tightly constructed, rhythm-oriented parts and wonderfully atmospheric sections which primarily derive from laid-back guitar textures and spacey synth sounds.

0465068359|1.0|First of all, we should distinguish about differences between 'War' & 'massacre'. Recently, some Un-Japanese Historians started to read papers at academic meetings. Don't swallow everything about she wrote & quackery photoes! This is a part of huge political campaign to heighten 'anti-Japanese sentimant'.If you have enough knowlege about Chinese & Japanese culture, you would find the truth easily. Such as phony Japanese uniforms in photoes, porno photoes with false captions, the way of massacre is absolutely Chinese, there were numbers of Chinese guerilla who just looked like civilians and Japanese soldiers shouln'tve fought with them ?, why after 1 month of the'massacre' population increased in Nankin, why we don't find  hybrid people,...etc...<BR>Chinese government made up stories of massacre for 'The Tokyo War Crimes Trial'. And Iris Chang wrote this book to take advantage of innocent people. Historically, Japanese have been utilized by Chinese for a long time anyway.<BR>If you are interested in 'This Event' more, you should know about Chinese people's idea 'Zhong hua si xiang',1930's historical & cultual backsgrounds. For reference I recommend you to read 'The alleged Nankin massacre' Meisei-sha, Inc. Then you shoul judge this with your own opinion and intelligence.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Chut up! Frank the Bunny would totally [chew] Harvey the Rabbit up.<br />A truly dark and original film. The first since \\"American Beauty,\\" \\"Fight Club,\\" and \\"Being John Malkovich,\\" to leave me with a sense of discovery. Like finding a diamond in the dirt at your feet. I read all the cast and crew bios expecting to find a link to the production of \\"American Beauty\\" or \\"PI,\\" but there wasn't any that I could find. The feeling  of \\"Donnie Darko\\" was very similar to elements of sound and cinematography of those two films. I consider myself a connoisseur of the strange, bizarre, weird, and surreal. If you are of the same ilk then this is destined to be a favorite of yours. It bacame an instant favorite of mine. I will await Richard Kelly's next work with anticipation. He is an outstanding newcomer. Let's hope he is as consistent in his quality of film making as M. Night Shyamlan.<br />Frank the Bunny Rules!
B0000648WZ|5.0|WARNING...this is a movie opinion, not a DVD review.<br />I'll skip over the great special effects, the awesome pacing, and the tense action to address this question of sarcasm.<br />Another reveiwer writes that he doesn't care for the bashing of patriotism or the militiary.  I can see how he came to the conclusion that ST is all about anti-fascism, but I see the movie in a different light.<br />Look at what this movie says and does while it's being tongue in cheek.  These people populate a vibrant society that works succesfully.  People are happy and comfortable, they have nice homes and attend sporting events and graduation parties.<BR>  <BR>Contrast this with most \\"future\\" movies like Bladerunner or  The Matrix that portray a dismal, colorless world of suffering and despair.  Gattaca was much more a warning of the dangers of fascism.<br />Starship Troopers shows a sunny and pleasantly upbeat place to live, and the price humanity has to pay in order to maintain their existence.<br />Yes, there are over-the-top militiary recruitment ads.  There are pro-war propaganda spots like the US had during WWII.  But it's necessary.  These people are in the fight of their life.  If they lose, humanity is lost.  It's understandable that a society would react in survival mode with everyone wanting to do their part to win the war.<br />So don't be so quick to slap a label of sarcasm on the gung ho militiary aspects of the movie.  The film portrays a perspective of might makes right, and it is this steadfast attitude of do-or-die in all the major characters that eventually turns the tide of the war.<br />These people have good lives, and in the vein of Mel Gibson's character in The Patriot, they can't affort to be squeamish about defending them.<br />They will fight<br />..and they will win!<br />This is a great film and I have asked for the Special Edition DVD for father's day.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is an excellent record, they take the blues roots and turn them upside down to create flashing and delightful music with taste and sound, you can feel, almost see Mick and Keith doing the backing vocals in Happy, tour feet are tapping the floor  from the start( Rocks off, Rip this joint), the sound is harsh and mellow. Its one of the records that i can play without feeling tired of it. Still cool after 30 years.
B000006TRV|3.0|This is basically what \\"the wall\\" is about: a man has problems with his mother, his teachers, women, wonders who's to blame, is tempted by extreme solutions (drugs, fascism), is punished and in the end settles down. Could be anybody's story, more or less, and it has been told a thousand times. The only true originality of \\"the wall\\" is that the main character is a rock star, so it MAY give the listener some vague clues about the creative process.<br />The music, on the other hand, is quite innovative, as a sort of mix of punk and previous Floydian contemplative/surrealistic moods. It had not been before and has not been done again since. I admit the album stretches far too long, but some compositions and Gilmour's guitar (and keyboards!) play make it worth a buying.<br />Neither the Floyd's best album nor the worst. And a fairly good introduction to other musical and literary experiences.<br />3/5
B00005JKCF|2.0|When I first heard of the massive amounts of cash that this movie was making I was delighted. Finally, a movie with Spidey that might just live up to the task. Unfortuneately, I was wrong!<br />I won't describe the movie's plot here, let's just say that everything is as it is in the comic.<br />However, The Green Goblin (wonderfully evil Willem Dafoe) is a sad disappointment. Ever wonder why he wasn't shown in the trailers? It's because his suit makes him look like a Power Ranger (remember those?)! Damn, if they can make Spidey so cool, why not Goblin? In all truth, the villains are usually the most fun to watch... Anyway, the acting is apart from Dafoe horrible, especially Kirsten Dunst who is alltogether not very attractive.<br />The next problem is the endless dialogue. Blah, blah, BLAH! You end around just waiting for the action sequences, which by all rights are just crazy!<br />The film also lacks a real plot. This boils down to the fact that Goblin doesn't have a real goal, like taking over the city or something. He just doesn't like Spiderman for some reason, and they fight, that's it... <br />All in all: 2 stars for the action, nothing for the rest.

0151008116|5.0|I read between 50 and 80 books a year and it is the rare novel that does not disappoint me on some level.  This book never let me down, I was never bored and I never felt the author cheated or left loose ends.  The language was simple and lyrical but full of symbolism and symmetry.  I loved the main character's honesty and optimism and his simple will to survive.  Above all I loved the choice of an alternate ending, neither story is a perfect fit leaving the reader the choice to make up their own mind.  I laughed, I cried and I'm recommending it to everyone I know.
0062502182|1.0|Reading this book is like eating circus peanuts, it's chewy, sweet, and contains no calories. The Alchemist is completely devoid of substance and it's &quot;deep message&quot; is laughable. If you really want to develop a personal philosophy, don't read this nonsense, find some real philosophical and religious texts. On the other hand, if you want a rosy, fluffy affirmation of the belief that &quot;everyone's dreams come true!,&quot; this is the book for you.

B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie is an extraordinary meditation on both death and life in America.  Lynch covers the whole emotional range, from hilarious parody to the ecstasy of erotic love to the unbearable pain of loss.  Several images from this film are guaranteed to stick with you.  The story is complex with many twists and turns, including a big shift with a half-hour to go.  And it all feeds an amazing, profound vision.  I won't describe the story--many other people are attempting to do that here.  Rather, I encourage you to see this film, and see it more than once.
6302054982|4.0|It's a classic. De Niro is one of my favorite actors of all time. His performance was great. And all power to Joe Pesci for winning an oscar, for best supporting actor. And Ray Liotta was great also. There was too much chemistry in the movie.
006097625X|5.0|Understanding Comics is a must have reference book for every creative professional.  The ideas presented in this book transcend sequential art and can be applied to every creative process.  As Scott Adams point out, the pursuit of advanced skills, often overshadows the core of art which is: \\"what do I want to say?\\"<br />I recommend this book to budding music composers to help them understand that a composition should be idea driven and the tools should support the idea.  Too often I find the tools driving the composition which results in a bunch of interesting sounds strung together.  Wallowing in novel sensation may be pleasant for a short amount of time, but music created in this fashion will not stand the test of time because it is emotionally void.<br />Even if you have zero interests in comics, artists of all professions need to read this book.
0790729652|5.0|I guess ive been a Batman fan since the day i saw this movie way back in the past century. It has a great music, i like what Danny Elfman did in this movie, i wouldnt think of any other kind of music for this kind of Hero. The music is so adecuate for the movie and the character. The actors are good. Jack Nicholson is just great, but old. If he were the Jack Nicholson from The Shining, that would be a great acting and a very extremely cool Joker. On the other hand, Bruce wayne ....not very great character. They should have called somebody else instead of Michael Keaton. He is just not too mysterial. But talking about the devil, the Batman was great. Quiet, too mysterial, just great. Keaton didnt do good on Wayne but he sure stay silent in the Batman disguese that you can just forget about the Wayne Character. i liked this movie, you star having a crush on the batmobile and on the bat-wing. but of course, you can always watch and like this movie as long as you are a Batman fan or like the batman character. and i you like nicholson of course...its just so great to see him this way.
0451196716|5.0|This is a great book. It was recommended to me by a customer who told me of all of King's books, this one stayed with him the most. I only finished it yesterday but I can see that he's probably right. I can't really be within a group of people without somehow thinking we're all like the boys in the Long Walk, trying to outdo everyone else as if our life depends on it. Yet, we're trapped with one another, and the only thing that buffers us from insanity is other people (Sartre said hell is other people, but is lonliness really all that much better?) <br />Well, not to get too philosophical or anything. It was a good, fast read. I was surprised most by the actual distance traveled in the Long Mile. I found myself wondering how they could still be on their feet, let alone walking at least 4 mph after hundreds of miles. And I was intrigued how desensitized the boys became to death, and how accepting they became of their own inevitable impending deaths. I can almost say some of them reached peace near the end. Perhaps that was the most disturbing part.<br />The ending was vague, as many have said. But I think King made his point. The winner wasn't really a winner after all.
6305897786|1.0|I cannot believe that I wasted two hours of my life that I will never get back on this pointless drivel.  The acting is mediocre at best, the plotline seems nearly pointless, the whole movie crawls along from one boring scene to the next, and the ending left me furious!  I was upset at the director for making the movie, the actors for &quot;performing&quot; (you can't call it &quot;starring&quot; for this) in the movie, and myself for actually taking a chunk out of my life and wasting it on this disappointing farce of a show.<br />I wish there were ways to give negative stars, but &quot;one&quot; is the lowest that the rating system here allows.  Save yourself the anxiety and rent something else.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Often imitated, but never topped, this Newman/Redford vehicle remains among the best of the best.  Free spirited and fun... made in the days when it was okay to cheer for the bad guys.
B00003CXXP|3.0|The back story of AI is fairly well known:  It was a project of Stanley Kubrick's for many years, and after Kubrick died, Steven Spielberg went ahead and made the film.  Ostensibly it was homage to Mr. Kubrick, but in fact it serves as a fascinating study of directorial philosophies and styles, and how a director's imprint on film is indelible.<br />Originally based on the short story \\"Super-Toys Last All Summer Long\\" by Brian Aldiss AI tells the story of David (Haley Joel Osment) the first robot that is built to love.  Many robots (or \\"mechas\\" as they are known) are loved -- animatronic sex toys called 'lover mechas,' are popular -- but this is a great leap forward:  David will love, not be loved.  A prototype David is built and delivered to the home of a couple whose son is cryogenically frozen.  At first the mother is appalled, but in one desperate moment she activates David's love circuits.  From that moment on, the instructions have warned her, David will love her completely and unfailingly.  As guaranteed, he does -- but she doesn't.<br />It seems clear that Kubrick's original vision was dark; corporate interests who will exploit grief and sell love for greater market share, or a society where maternal love itself becomes another mass-produced disposable commodity.  But Spielberg doesn't seem interested in such themes, and steers the film into a rather dull retelling of -- surprise -- Pinocchio.  Yes, David is the puppet who wants to be a real boy.  Set against a backdrop of a post-apocalyptic earth where the sea levels have risen hundreds of feet, this top-drawer effects film is a routine rehash of Spielberg's favorite fairy tale.  The mecha David is the puppet, his manufacturer Geppeto, his animatronic teddy Jiminy Cricket.<br />These two basic visualizations -- presumably Kubrick's and Spielberg's -- simply do not mesh.  A scene where a mecha is destroyed for human entertainment is a good example of crippling misdirection.  A robot is fired from a cannon, set afire, and passed through rotating knives.  The mecha is voiced by Chris Rock, who offers his usual street-jive patter.  Yet we hear (and perhaps laugh) at Rock's voice only an instant before the mecha's burning face, torn from its head, smashes against the bars of David's cage.  David -- and the audience -- recoils in horror.  It's a woeful mismatch.<br />The film shows flashes of originality and a great deal of technical brilliance.  Jude Law, who plays a lover mecha (\\"Gigolo Joe\\", he is called, but all such mechas might be called that) is superb, and his make-up is unnerving.  The supertoy, Teddy, is a perfect blend of pessimism and determination as he keeps up with David's quest for the Blue Fairy, all the while warning him of the dangers along the way.  Even Haley Joel Osment does the best he can with his bafflingly contradictory role.  He is most effective in the early scenes, when his skin looks like very expensive plastic, and his flat smile gives us, as well as his foster-mother, the willies.<br />Visually the movie is stunning.  The effects are always good and in some cases astonishing (such as the flying craft seen in the film's epilogue).  Spielberg, even when he gets bogged down in mawkishness and sentimentality, is the master visual technician and takes us effortlessly through the surreal images of this strange future world.  But his screen story -- at least starting from Kubrick's black thesis -- seems untenable.  A story of a robot that can be \\"switched on\\" to love when it is convenient for the owner, and then cast away when not, should not have a happy ending. One can only wonder where Kubrick would have gone with the idea.

0790734060|4.0|This is my second viewing of the movie, and I realize how very much I missed the first time.  One should be prepared for it.  Do not expect it to be a faithful biography, because it certainly isn't.  And it's not supposed to be.  That is not the purpose.  <br />Rather, this is a bit of a fantasy retelling of the life and times of a brilliant composer.  The film is hypnotic in the images produced, and the Mozart music is enthralling.<br />There is darkness here as we're taken into the mind of Salieri and his envy of Mozart's ability to create such beautiful music.  And we must bear in mind that this portrayal is undoubtedly an injustice to the historical Salieri.  This is much more of a &quot;what if&quot; than a realistic picture.  <br />That in mind, this is a picture to be savored, to be enjoyed.
B0000584V3|5.0|If there's one thing that can be said about Opeth, it is that they are bleak.  Heck, they even have a song called \\"Bleak\\".  Can't get much bleaker than that, can you?  But, does that mean they are bad?  Of course not!<br />Opeth is a brilliant band, and nearly impossible to describe.  They take the brutality of melodic death, and meld it with progressive strong structures and folkish acoustic passages.  It's one thing to combine all these things, but making them sound as though they belong together is quite another.  Opeth accomplishes this quite perfectly.  A song will be heavy and raging one second, and calm and serene the next.  It may nearly give you musical whiplash at first, but it all fits together.  Mikael Akerfeldt is an amazing vocalist.  He can do a deep, gravelly death growl, and then sing in a nice soft voice, and he sounds great doing both.  There is so much emotion here, from anger, to beauty, to tranquility, to sadness.<br />The songs are very epic, and somewhat meandering, but they still hold your attention.  Almost all of the songs top ten minutes, and you never know where they're going from one second to the next.  \\"The Leper Affinity\\" is your first taste of the madness, starting off in typical melodic death fashion, then breaking into a nice acoustic interlude in the middle, and finishing with soft piano at the end.  \\"Harvest\\" is probably the most accessible song on here.  A haunting acoustic ballad, with clean vocals all the way through, and not quite as long as the rest, this is probably about as close to \\"catchy\\" as Opeth is likely to get.  \\"The Funeral Portrait\\" and the title track are good riff-heavy rockers, with just the right amount of melody thrown in.  These songs are sure to please any head-banger.  \\"Patterns in the Ivy\\" is a short instrumental, with only piano and acoustic guitar.  Very peaceful and atmospheric.  The musicianship here is quite curious.  They possess a high level of skill, and yet they manage to avoid ever crossing into the boundaries of \\"overplaying\\".  How they managed to do this is beyond me.  I would have liked a bit more soloing, though, but oh well, there is plenty.<br />This band is definitely not for everybody, but I highly recommend them to anyone with a good attention span and an open mind.into the boundaries of \\"overplaying\\".

B000000WHX|3.0|i like Blue Lines, but the truth is it is a derivative piece of music compared to Mezzanine. I know there are those who think Mezzanine is several steps down, and Blue Lines represents MA's apogee, but when I heard \\"Be Thankful...\\" for example, I thought \\"straight out of Style Council, right down to the precise guitar textures and harmonies.\\" What is \\"one Love\\" but souped up reggae? I don't mind pastiches of others' sounds, from PM Dawn mumbling \\"comatose\\" to \\"west end town in a dead end world...\\" whoever the hell that was, but call a spade a spade. Blue Lines is fine, but it ain't a big breakthrough that's gonna last a millenium. Neither will Mezzanine, but Mezz takes more risks, and for me, provides far bigger rewards

B00005K3OT|5.0|I wanted to see this movie every since reading about it in a movie magazine 2 years ago. It has since become one of my all time favorite movies (along with Dangerous Liaisons). It captures an feeling of surprise and wonderous sensations. Almost everyone loves chocolate (either dark, milk, white or semi-sweet) and this movie concentrates on that particular love. However it also has a interesting plot. <BR>A single mom blows into a very religious small French town during the season of lent. &lt;And as every Catholic knows, you must fast or abstain from an item you are used to having or doing.&gt; What rocks the church is that she opens a &quot;sweet shop&quot;.  <BR>The movie is sweeping with passion, romance, food and innocence. <BR>Juliette Binoche is &quot;a classic work of art&quot; that melted my heart. She is sinously beautiful and yet retains a silent lifestyle. She is not your typical Hollywood starlet, nor should she ever consider herself that. There are not many beauties in Hollywood that are real and a natural woman. Juliette has a beauty that is plain in nature and yet could melt the sun. <BR>This is one of the best DVD's I own. It has everything a film lover could want. The making of the movie; the deleted scenes; commentary by the director and the actors. It even has a special area dedicated to the costumes. It also has the trailer and teasers. <BR>The DVD is great but the movie far surpasses any dramatic movie in recent history. It is a story about giving in to your wildest fantasies and yet staying grounded.<BR>If you have not seen it yet, you must have this movie. Believe me, it will raise your spirits and make your mouth water with all of the chocolate.
B000044TZU|5.0|I love this CD, when I first got it I listened to it constantly and I still listen to it often (2 years later).  The songs are mostly ballads, but they are so good to listen to.

B00003CXI1|3.0|I'd almost swear that there is stuff missing that I remember seeing in the movie theater. Also, the special features is ridiculous. I didn't want to play all the games and go through all the tasks just to see the cut scenes. I've been all over the Harry Potter official website for almost a year now, and read the books numerous times, I did NOT need everything respelled out for me over and over. Also in the book the smallest bottle of potion should be the one who gets Harry to the Stone, however the dvd special feature game seemed to have just randomly picked another and I had to start allover again. <br />I also think they really skimped out on cut scenes. After Snape's potions class there's over an hour left in the movie, where's the rest of the cut scenes? There had to be more. <br />The movie itself was pretty good aside from what I've already said, so if you don't care about cut scenes and goofy slow loading games go ahead and buy a copy.

This CD doesn't even hit a flat spot until 5 tracks in (the forgettable noise \\"Square Dance\\") but then, it jumps right back up in your face and stays strong through the closing curtain. There are so many great tracks that it's hard to narrow down a top five, but after listening straight through about 10 times, I would have to say that \\"White America\\" and \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\" are my two favorite songs on the CD.  Definite \\"instant classic\\" material from EM.  You gotta love this guy.  One of the most original and talented music makers since the dawn of the rock era.  Love him or hate him, you must know that this guy deserves the hype!
6301095014|5.0|Rambo III is the prime example of the perfect action movie. Instead of the countless James Bond's where sex is the only thing on his mind, or the terrible John Woo action we see in laughable movies like Face/Off and Mission: Impossible 2. Rambo's are far more concentrated, it takes all of its action (And superb action it is) and focuses it right where it wants it so this movie does not become an over-blown piece of trash action movie like The Rock. Stallone is perfect in the Rambo role and displays awesome physical action to where we believe he is a one man war-machine, the story plays itself out well, ditching its Vietnam protest in the first two and giving something new with plenty of explosions and action to satisfy any movie buff. Its amazing to see a movie that is deemed by so many clowns here as an idiot-action movie become so much more. Rambo III is fantastic.
B000062TU1|1.0|Movie is great. The DVD implementation is TERRIBLE.<br />In order to get to any of the extras on the second disk, you have to go through a stupid &quot;game&quot; -- Installed on your PC it installs a gazillion extra programs. Put in the DVD rom player, it crashes the system. And the games are not optional or quick -- they are necessary in order to unlock the access to all the special extras, and take a LOT of time where, if you miss a step, you get thrown back to the beginning.<br />...<br />Beware - dropping it into your machine will trigger a dozen or so plugins for Interactual to install (assuming the player is already installed; otherwise it'll likely install the player).  It'll also install a couple of stand alone helper apps, like a proprietary quicktime-vr like player (which requires you to reboot, and messes with your OLE runtime).  On the other hand, if you don't play it in a dvd-rom you'll go slowly,  gibberingly, insane playing it with a normal dvd remote.  It'll probably end up *in* your tv.  The remote that is.  On this disc is where the seven &quot;never before seen&quot; scenes are.  But wait! To<br />get there, we have to play the game!  Yes, you must do combat with the disc to earn the right to see the extra footage.  You can do it by trial and error, but that'll take forever.  Basically you have to go to the &quot;third floor&quot;, which you end up doing at least once by just clicking on things trying to figure out what they do.  In fact, the first thing I clicked on, right after the warning about not going there, said &quot;Oh, you've decided to go to the third floor.  Well, don't say we didn't warn you...&quot;<br />Once you get through all this, there are brief glimpses of deleted scenes (they are obviously saving the rest out for a future created by), and clips from press releases &quot;interviews with&quot;<br />The &quot;extra credit&quot; section is dvd-rom only, but consists 90% of links that take you to marketting web sites for other products of the studios.  One takes you to HarryPotter.com, but just the generic site, not a special dvd tie in.  There *is* a feature where the sorting hat will actually randomly sort you, and display a picture that says &quot;Welcome YourName to Whatever House&quot;, and take you to a web site that allows you to register yourself to get owlmail. Entertainingly, this web feature wasn't finished in time for the dvd release<br />So, in general, it might be mildly entertaining once, but in general the bonus features are a sterling example of how *NOT* to do this, and how to insult people in the process...
B0000640S1|3.0|Rambo is an odd trilogy, odd in a sense that every installment grows stronger, and by alot. In First Blood we're introduced to a burned-out, edge of insanity war-vet haunted by past experiences in the Vietnam War. On his pathless journey a hillbilly town police officer halts him, harasses him, arrests him, his co-workers push him and all hell breaks loose. First Blood does sport some very well done action, especially with Rambo on the mountain setting traps, leaping off a cliff and trekking through a dark mine shaft. However the movie focuses too much on typical \\"stupid cops\\" who break the rules and way too much emphasis on anti-Vietnam war statements even though the war was far over after this. Its too one-sided, and too angry and Stallone's quote at the end a about a memory of Vietnam has been heard all too many times before. It doesn't work in the sense that this isn't a war movie, it isn't a drama, its an action movie. Yet its action does keep viewers entertained despite its out of place side-story.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I've read all of the books in this series--RED DRAGON, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and finally HANNIBAL--and while RED DRAGON is by far the best book, this DVD is out of sight.  It contains a plethora of features that enhance viewing and understanding of the subject matter; which is vital to the ordinary viewer who stumbles upon this DVD without the knowledge of the previous films--MANHUNTER and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Manhunter was made in the 80's and was Hannibal lector's first time on the big screen.  I purchase DVDs for more than the movie; I indulge myself with most of the extra features and buy mostly for that reason alone.  I loved the ending of the book and would have liked to see it stay the same for the movie; however the ending of this film is quite good, and there are alterante endings.  The commentary with Ridley Scott is excellent and gives major insight in the construction and making of the film.  For those of you who do not listen to the commentary on DVDs, I would encourage you to do so with this one.  Ridley Scott is a very good filmmaker and he polishes his craft whenever possible.  He is at his best in this DVD and gives in-depth discussions on why certain scenes are not in the movie, and why some characters that were present in the book could not be incorporated into the movie.  This is an excellent DVD with an overabundance of great features that make it worth the money.
B00006690F|4.0|Eminem's third set is a very strong one, proving finally to all nay sayers that he is more than just a gimmick but actually a lyrically talented mc.  Upon the 1st track White America we see that this is not just another album in which he is talking about nonsense like sticking 9 inch nails thru eyelids and Tom green humping dead animals he actually has something to say.  Business is a track in which he is rapping about his skills.  Cleaning out my closet is a very personal song which he talks about his mom (taking what she never helped him to get) and dad (how he left in 73) and how he is going to take responsiblity for his daughter if nothing else and in fact this is my favorite song on the disk.  Drips is hilarious and about getting an STD where you least expect it.  Without me is of course his TRL rdio friendly song. Theres also a song he sings for Hailie on which i like and also a song called say what you say that is a direct shot at jermaine dupri featuring Dr. Dre that is also notable the album as a whole is one of the years best so far and of course will sell a zillion copies it's ranked #1 here on billboard and probably in a million other countries as well.  With each passing album eminem is showing maturity which is a good thing because i was worried about whether or not he would have staying powerto be around in 2010 and the eminem show, while it still has some of the immature violence and lyrics, is definitely a leap in the right direction.
B00000J8EK|4.0|Every time I listen to this record I am blown away by how amazing it is. I'm really surprised by its rating (not generally a fan favorite). This is actually my favorite Chemical Brothers album. I like it because it's so diverse. One of the reasons they remain some of my favorite electronica performers to date is for their ability to combine harshness with beauty (that was said in an interview and I thought it was so true). For example, Out of Control (if I'm not mistaken produced by the lead singer of New Order) is my favorite track; it's incredible, danceable, with a beat that's almost impossible not to move to. Track 8,Got Glint?, also has a great beat, but it has a more spiritual vibe to it that I can't really explain. I really think the Chemical Brothers experimented a little bit more on this record (although plenty of people would argue that) which is why it didn't do as well. The whole album is a beautiful assortment of dance tracks well worth the 18 or so bucks it costs for a cd these days.
0553381687|5.0|What I really love about this book is how it focuses as much on the characters as on the plot (Neither are laking).  The book doesn't waste your time with characters but you get to know them as the story develops and they have to make tough decisions.  Also the characters are very substantial and commonly have lots of heart. When they are betraied or get lost in a dark castile its like your there with them. Martin women makes very good woman charaters.<BR>         One thing I don't like about this book is the religion of it.  The gods in this book are the same as in nearly every fanticy book I've read. I would like to see some Christian fantacy.  There are Christian fanticy writers out there but their books aren't being published.
B000002L9J|5.0|Most would call it The Smiths best album, and they would be both right and wrong.  In many ways, the sharp pop songs that comprise The Queen Is Dead represents the band at their zenith.  The Smiths were fast and furious, and their four year streak resulted in many moments of brilliance that tend to run together, making labelling any one work as 'the best' a near impossibility.  However, The Queen Is Dead captures Morrissey at his peak-he leaps from rockabilly to ballad crooner with suprising agility (and plenty of attitude), as does Johnny Marr with his melodic, precise guitar work. All the band's best elements form a solid stream of music that expresses everything from gay love on \\"The Boy With the Thorn in His Side'\\" to the out-reach odditty 'Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others.\\"  It's a shame they disapeared from the music world so quickly- and yet it seems almost merciful.  Watching them waste away into mediocrity would have been a shame.

0345347951|4.0|Although this is a science fiction classic its theme is consonant with the short story of the above name by the Christian writer Flannery O'Connor, who was profoundly influenced by the philosophy of Teilhard de Chardin. Chardin maintained the the universe and humankind were evolving toward a perfect state where all opposites and contradictions merge into oneness.<BR>Clarke in this spare and still disquieting work offers a similar vision, more apocalyptic than evolutionary perhaps, but ultimately life-affirming. Clarke has the last man, as he views the final apotheosis, observe that religions had it all wrong, but this is true only of those who preach self-glorification. There is another, more philosophical religious tradition that views self-denial and the annihilation of personality as the ultimate goal of both individuals and the human race. Indeed Kierkegaard could provide the epigram for this thoughtful, metaphysical novel: All true religion begins in self-renunciation. <BR>Not only in the origins of the universe (Big Bang theory) but in eschatology also, may  religion and science be on the path to a new convergence.
B000000ZGO|5.0|&quot;Walk On By&quot; completely altered the sound and scope of 70's soul and &quot;Hyberbolicsyllabicsesquedelamystic&quot; re-wrote the book on length, sound, texture and content in most popular music, oh, and it GROOVES LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE! This sprawling masterwork (containing only 4 tracks) is still an impressive LP more than 30 years after it's release and dozens of other soul/rock artists followed the path Hayes laid down. There is not a moment wasted here and Hayes proves himself to be a writer, arranger, composer and player without peer.<br />Essential Listening.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing the video on VH1 for &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; - I could not get the song out of my head.  I kept humming it.  I HAVE NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED!!  This CD is absolutely fabulous - Norah Jones' voice is haunting.  The songs on this CD are very diverse - some jazz, some older standard, some folk and one that sounds a bit country.  I have not taken this CD out of my player since I bought it - it's my favorite 'Sunday morning, read the paper' CD.  <br />I highly recommend this CD!!
B00006690F|5.0|Im a big fan of eminem (I Mean big, I've ate a roach to prove my love!!!!) and I was afraid after all the hype, and fans and all this ish that's been goin' on about Eminem, that he would go soft and start sucking and all that. but im SO happy to say that he's still the BEST. He's still crazy, he's still real, he still carries everything I've loved about him since his first EP 'Infinate' So I know, I'll ALWAYS be the big hardcore Eminem fan I am, because he'll ALWAYS be real, even after the controversy, after all the fake fans and EVERYONE loving him he'll always be that talented raw rapper. That's what I love about him, he's real and he keeps it real even after it's so hard to stay real with all these people.

0679735909|4.0|To be honest, I read Possession because my English teacher persuaded me to. I started out quite skeptical but as the book went on I became really engrosed in it. I loved the way the story unravelled of the secret romance but I didn't find the poetry or the letters very interesting. Despite it being a really interesting book, I was slightly disappointed with the ending which I thought could have been worked on more.
B00006690G|4.0|This is a much more mature effort by Eminem especially after his controversial \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" album. He seems to have mellowed down too on his hardcore lyrics, he seems to try tell us some of his frustrations in life. He mentions his mother, father, Kim (Ex-wife) and Hailie (his daughter) alot in many of his songs on this album.<br />There were some brilliant songs on \\"The Eminem Album\\", the album starts off awesome with songs such as \\"White America\\" (He explains his frustrations of been dissed for been a white raper), \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" (Guess what? You got it... his mother gets dissed to the max once again) and \\"Square Dance\\" (My personal favourite on the album). There are many other great songs on the album \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood\\", \\"Without Me\\" and \\"Say What U Say\\".<br />I was also very disappointed by some of his songs, \\"Superman\\", \\"'Till I Collapse\\" and \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\". I personally thought those songs were very poor (Only my opinion you people my like them!).<br />All you hardcore Eminem fans will probably like it BUT I also think you non-Eminem fans may also like this album because of his change in style since \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\". A very mature effort for Eminem. <br />Rating 4/5
B00004XQ83|5.0|As a world traveler for the last 15 years, my tastes in music are pretty eclectic, however there were always facets of my musical thirst left unsated. I saw the movie on a whim on the opening weekend and rushed to amazon.com to buy the album as soon as I got home. I had never drunk from this spring before but oh, the refreshment and taste of pure mountain country, blues, bluegrass, folk, and gospel music. <br />Please, please, please, whatever type of music you are in to, give this album a few listens and be transported to another time and place. Throw away any prejudices and rediscover the pure enjoyment of music in its simplicity. <br />Are you thirsty?
B000063UR2|5.0|At the outset, let me state that I am a longtime Tangerine Dream fan, so I was skeptical that the Goldsmith score would outdo what I considered to be TD's finest soundtrack work. Alas, I was right. The Goldsmith score is rather bland, characterless, nondescript &quot;fluff&quot; that never gets at the darkness or magic in the movie the way the TD score does. Watch the initial forest scenes in both versions and tell me there isn't more charm and magic in the TD score. Ditto on the re-edit: I find the US version to be tight, well paced, and blessedly devoid of the &quot;cuteness&quot; of the extended cut. The material cut for the US Release was wisely gone, and the movie seems flabby and self indulgent now with it restored. I am glad both versions were released in this package - the original is the one I will treasure always.
0738206679|5.0|Barabasi is a rarity among scientists: he can tell great stories for a wide audience without sacrificing scientific depth and accuracy. His book is simply the best book I have ever read on &quot;the new science&quot; of complexity.

B00005JKCF|5.0|This film definitely stands out as the first blockbuster of the summer. It's steamrolled its way through the box office and doesn't seem to be slowing down too much, coming in close second to Star Wars: Episode II this past weekend. I was definitely impressed with what this movie had to offer. The acting impressed me on all levels. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst both did extremely well in their roles with Maguire fitting the Spider-Man/Peter Parker persona to near perfection.<br />The special effects stand out as one of the great aspects in this film and are extremely well done. Despite a couple of scenes in which they are obviously computer generated, in which some people think that it made the scenes look cheesy, I don't think these minor flaws took anything away from the movie as a whole. The remaining effects in the movie, namely the scenes as he webs his way from building to building, are nothing short of exhilarating.<br />The plot of the movie followed the story of the Spider-Man comics quite admirably with the Green Goblin storyline and the anticipated emergence of Hobgoblin. I think it would be great if they also included one of the better Spider-Man villains (e.g. Carnage, Venom) in the sequel (to a limited extent where it's inclusiveness isn't overdone as in the Batman movies). But apart from that, it also appealed to those who weren't hardcore fans of the comic book series and was certainly easy to follow if you weren't familiar with the details of Spider-Man's background.<br />If you didn't truly enjoy this movie, then face it. You just don't like good movies. This had a little bit of everything for everyone. Those who didn't get anything out of it should seek a profession as a critic and make money off of their wordy blurbs and useless opinions while continuously praising those discrete low-budget movies that nobody ever cares to or really wants to go see. Definitely one of the most enjoyable super-hero movies to date if not the most. The directing was well done, the plot was excellent, good acting, great effects. Overall, an excellent flick.
B0000640SA|5.0|It's finally here.  The wait is over.  Now, you can get the special edition of \\"Memento,\\" which is loaded with tons of cool features and extras.  Not only that, but the movie is also remastered, both in picture and sound.  Is this special edition worth getting?  You betcha!<br />The picture quality is outstanding!  It's hard to believe that this is a low-budget film.  Somebody wrote a review claiming that this wasn't in widescreen.  I don't know what kind of version that person got, but the one I bought is very much widescreen, so don't let that throw you off track.  To have this movie be presented in full screen would be a crime!  I also noticed how much better the sound quality is.  I haven't had a chance to watch it in DTS, but I'm sure the quality is top-notch.<br />Before the special features, a little recap of what the movie is about for those who are new to this movie.  Leonard Shelby has a condition.  He has no short term memory.  Everything fades for him.  If he talks to someone for too long he'll forget who that person is and what they were talking about.  Ten or twenty minutes later he'll have no recollection of what happened earlier on.  The twist: he's looking for the man who raped and murdered his wife.  Now, Leonard is armed to the teeth with important tattoos to help him remember important info, and is also armed with a camera to take pictures of those who he encounters.  He only lives for revenge, wanting to find the identity of a killer he can't possibly ever know for sure.  The second twist is that the movie is told in REVERSE order.  So, be warned; this is not a movie you can just sit down and eat your popcorn and relax.  This is a movie that forces you to think.<br />Now the special features; there's tons of them.  You get to hear director commentary, which is very cool.  On the second disk is where all of the special features lie, but you can't just click on them.  OH NO!  You've got to work to earn them.  Solve brain teasers and puzzles and answer questions very much like a psychological test.  Very cool!  If you're a fan of the movie, you won't mind the work.  Some of the features are a behind the scenes feature, two trailers, pictures, the short story by Nolan's brother, Leonard's journal, and more.  And there are hidden features I have yet to find.

B00005JKJA|5.0|It goes without saying that not all films are for everyone. Okay, 'Shrek' may be the singular exception, but I'll someone doesn't like that movie. 'Mulholland Drive' is pretty much every film major's dream because it's so enigmatic and diverse in it's themes that you can slap just about any meaning onto it that you want and it'll make sense. The real beauty of the film lies in it's enigma. You can explore it from numerous angles and strain your brain's reasoning center with all of them. And it's got two chicks doing it!<br />On the surface, 'Mullholland Drive' is a story about two women searching for the truth about one woman's past in a town of back-stabbers, murders, and the moronically avant garde, that suddenly takes a turn for the confusing that hurls faces, names, and characteristics into a blender and turns it up really high. If you don't start watching the movie with your symbolism glasses on you'll be confused to the point of insanity shortly after the introduction of the blue box. Fortunately the DVD includes a list of ten clues to figuring the mystery out, written by David Lynch. Read this first off or be prepared to clean grey matter of the walls.<br />'Mullholland Drive' can also be taken as a Freudian metaphor rather than literal occurances. Which leads more into a story about personnal struggle and sacrifice for fame rather than lonliness and rejection in relationships. The fact is there as many interpretations of the film as there are people who've seen it. Well, less actually, since a lot of people wrote it off as non-sensical 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' fodder (I will admit that it isn't diffacult to MST3K this movie). From it's intentionally bad acting at the beginning, to the Silencio scene, the film is meticulously crafted, and a great experience for people who enjoy reading too much into movies or just really want to impress people with their intelligence without having to be very intelligent at all.<br />Oh, and if anyone can explain the cowboy to me, I'd appreciate it.

B00000J7RZ|2.0|Middling debut album with only a few tracks worth the bother.  &quot;If You Had My Love&quot; is a pleasant tune from Rodney Jerkins and &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot; is a highly energetic disco stomper that makes the best use of Lopez's barely-there voice.  It's pretty much downhill from there.  &quot;Let's Talk About Us&quot; is Babyface redux and &quot;Let's Get Loud&quot; sounds forced.  And, please, should she ever feel the need to do a duet, don't let it be with someone as vocally talented as Marc Anthony.  Anthony's powerful voice only dwarfs Lopez's and, thusly, does far more harm than good.  This record may have been a million seller, but credit that to her image and attitude. The music on this album, though not disastrous, is merely an afterthought.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I can't believe this movie was in and out of the theaters so fast that when my friends rented it, I had never heard of it.  I also can't believe this movie didn't win any awards--it is unbelievably amazing--the story, the soundtrack, the acting, and the cinematography.  I'll leave it to others to describe the movie further, but this really is one of those movies that stay with you for awhile.  It is genuinely creepy, surreal, intelligent, original, and an Echo and the Bunnymen song opens the movie...what could be cooler than that?
B00003CX8J|4.0|Brian Singer's take on the classic X Men comic is a fun, action-filled film with great characters and eye-popping SFX. Director Singer, best known for The Usual Suspects, has created a film which is inventive and exciting while staying true to the comic's origins.<br />The main star of the film is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, a rouge mutant who joins Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)'s team of mutants including Cyclops, Storm and Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who are pitted against Magneto (Ian McKellen), the head honcho of bad guys with a plan to turn the world's population into mutants.<br />Wolverine is the main guy here, as Jackman proves to be perfect for the role of the hairy guy with some nasty claws. The star power of McKellen and Patrick Stewart gives the film it's gravitas, and the supporting cast of Tyler Mane as the imposing Sabertooth and Ray Park as Toad combine to create a great ensamble cast abbeted with a great script to work with.<br />Seamless CG combined with impressive live-action stunts is awesome, and the film's strong point, action, is well-paced and exciting, with a string of set-pices building up to the huge and amazing finale. The score, by Michael Kamen is a pulse-driven soundtrack that fits the film's style and tone well.<br />There are problems; the film does centre around Wolverine too much, making you want a bit more exposition on the other charcters and their backgrounds, and the film's running time makes the viewer want more, but hey, that's what sequels are for, and the next instalment will no doubt be worth the wait...<BR>The DVD extras are impressive with \\"making of\\"s, deleted scenes and production material.
B000066744|4.0|This is a sort of fantasy, or fable.  Roth plays the title character, who is abandoned as a baby on an ocean liner, right at the turn of the century, and is fancifully given &quot;1900&quot; as a surname by the stoker who finds him.  He spends his whole life on the ship, never setting foot on land, and becomes a fantastically accomplished pianist.  Vince plays his friend, a trumpeter who is a fellow musician in the ship's band.<BR>He narrates some of the story, to a music store owner (Peter Vaughan) to whom he sells his trumpet, and in whose store he finds the only copy of the only recording ever made by his friend; and to the man in charge of blowing up the now-decrepit liner after WW2.<br />I had barely heard of this movie, and rented the DVD without great hopes because I didn't see anything else on the shelves that much appealed to me.  As it turned out, I loved it.  It is visually beautiful, Roth and Vince are excellent, and the score by Ennio Morricone is great.  It is one of those relatively few movies that I know I will want to watch again, probably more than once.  There are scenes that are just wonderful, in which some action occurs or story is told as &quot;1900&quot; plays the piano.<br />I won't presume to try to nail down exactly what the movie is &quot;about&quot;, but it touches on the social role of the musician, and the relationship of art and life.  It is, admittedly, somewhat sentimental, and not all scenes are equally successful.  But all in all, I think this is a really terrific movie.<br />Btw, dialogue is in English; there are no subtitles, for those who care.
B00005JKL8|5.0|I didn't get to see this film in theatres, and quite honestly, I didn't really want to, either. In fact, when going to rent a movie for the weekend, I passed this one despite a suggestion from a friend. Eventually, I decided to check it out, although I thought it would be another &quot;stupid war movie.&quot; I was very pleasantly surprised.<br />Although not completely accurate, it was still a great action film that kept me interested the entire time. (And after all, Hollywood's first priority was never accuracy, was it?) I thought the acting from Gene Hackman was wonderful, and Owen Wilson did a great job, as well. Although predictable at times, this is one of those rare films in which, even though you know what will happen, you STILL want to see it. <br />Overall, a great film. I would highly recommend it.
B000063V8R|5.0|In the first episode we see the return of Dr. Crusher.  I can't tell you all how much of a relief it was to see her return this season.  I was so glad they got rid of the annoying Dr. Pulaski when Beverly came back.  The Pulaski character was annoying like nails are on a blackboard.  Plus she was too condescending towards Data.  Please, someone warp her to the nearest blackhole and shove her out an airlock.  Then the return of Tasha in Yesterdays Enterprise...worst thing they could have done.  I actually did like her until she left ST:TNG to pursue a career on the big screen.  (I feel it did help the rest of the characters evolve though, when she did leave.) Then, she did what she could to get back on the series after her movie career was a huge flop.  Can anyone really remember a movie she was in.  Lets see, does a glow-in-the-dark condem mean anything to anyone.  They should have left her in dry dock.  Well, the studio let her come back...again (in future episodes) where she plays her own daughter, which is a Romulan, and who has huge chip on her shoulders towards the Federation for the death of her mother.  Hmmmmm, wasn't it Tasha who wanted to return with the Enterprise-C to help make her death mean something and to help the undermanned crew of the ship.  I guess Tasha didn't instill that ethic of altruism in her daughter before she died.  If anything, the studio should have used her daughter to unite and bring The Federation and The Romulans closer together instead of keeping them enemies.<br />Otherwise this was an excellent season.  The characters have become the crew of the enterprise that I will always think of them as.  The actors seem to have grown into their characters and all that needs to be done with them now is to have the characters evolve.  There is a lot of excitement this season too.  Here are a few plots...Geordi falls in love with a holographic Dr. Brahms while trying to save the Enterprise, Data gets to have an away mission by himself, Deanna's mother, Lwaxana, returns for a visit only to be kidnapped with Deanna by the Ferengi.  Data creates himself a daughter in \\"The Offspring\\".  I am very excited to get this season on DVD.  Especially with the season finale where we get to see the return of The Borg and our first glimpse at Locutus of Borg.  I think this season is a must for any fan, besides to steal a phrase...resistance is fulite.  A must have Season
B000002U82|5.0|Am I the only one who cries every time I listen to &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky?&quot;  If I were an astronaut, would this be the album I listen to as I leave our solar system and head for places unknown?  I'm not sure if words can ever do justice to a real work of art, but I've got to say that this album just keeps on giving.  One thing that amazes me is that people of all ages (from 10-80) can truly appreciate the beauty of this record.  Despite its reputation as a &quot;tripping&quot; album, it can shred your soul when you're totally clean, such as listening to it in the dark, outside under the starry sky, or even with groovy strobe lights at your local laser light show.  The first CD I ever bought (after I wore out many a tape) and the one I'd take with me if the house were on fire.

B0000025DD|5.0|For those who think David Gilmour was(and is) obscured by Roger Waters and others, this album is the complete proof of is great power as song writer and guitarrist.<BR> No one can forget that he's the author of the greatest piece of music ever written(in my opinion) and produced by Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb.<BR> My very best to David Gilmour.
B00005J9U1|5.0|THE BAND: \\"The Wailers\\" (1972-1981) are Bob Marley (lead vocals, guitar, percussion), Peter McIntosh (piano, organ, guitar), Bunny Livingston (congas, bongos), Aston Barrett (bass, percussion), Carlton Barrett (drums & percussion), Karl Lindo (keyboards), Karl Smith (guitar), Donald Kinsey (guitar), Julian Marvin (guitar)... and other assorted players over the years.<br /><br />THE DISC: (2001) 20 tracks in chronological order of release - clocking in at approximately 78 minutes. Contains a 19-page booklet with page by page song listing, the album the songs came from, the year released of each song, numerous pictures, band members, and thank you's (no lyrics). Digitally remastered sound. Label - Tuff Gong / Island.<br /><br />COMMENTS: \\"One Love\\" is a wonderful CD. A notch better than \\"Legend\\" due to 5 extra songs and crisp remastering. You'll find 14 of the 15 songs from \\"Legend\\" here (minus \\"\\"Satisfy My Soul\\"). The necessary extra songs you get are \\"Iron Lion Zion\\", \\"So Much Trouble In The World\\", \\"Roots, Rock, Reggae\\", \\"Turn Your Lights Down Low\\" and the hit or miss bonus \\"I Know A Place\\" (never released). This compilation grabs from most of Marley's popular works... 2 songs from the CD \\"Burnin'\\", 1 from \\"Kaya\\", 1 from \\"Natty Dread\\", 1 from \\"Survival\\", 1 from \\"Confrontation\\", 2 from \\"Uprising\\", and a stunning 6 from his most succesful studio album \\"Exodus\\". You also get a better rendition of the \\"Redemption Song\\" featuring the whole band and not just Marley and his guitar. There are a few tunes I miss from \\"Kaya\\" and 2 tunes in particular I miss from \\"Natty Dread\\" (\\"Lively Up Yourself\\" and \\"So Jeh Seh\\"). If you own no Marley, this is THE place to start. Nice liner notes and photography as well - the sleeve cover photo is one of the best naturally posed pictures of Bob Marley I can remember. When you think of the MASTER of reggae, you MUST think of Bob Marley... and this is his best single compilation to date. Seems like it was just last year when he died (1980)... the time flies by and his music still sounds fresh and current. The legend lives on! Great disc.es by and his music still sounds fresh and current. The legend lives on! Great disc.
6304773382|3.0|\\"Tank Girl\\" isn't a sci-fi epic that plays it straight.  In \\"Girl\\" Rebecca struggles to survive on an Earth ravaged by collision with a comet in 2020 (uh oh, that's not too far down the way...) and hasn't seen a day of rain since.  Much of the power is held by the corporate fascists of \\"Water Power\\".  Some shadowy mutants (called Rippers) challenge WP directly, but most like Rebecca (Lori Petty, the Tank Girl of the title) just try to keep to themselves, survive on their own without going insane.<BR>Though it starts with one of the oldest premises in the history of sci-fi films, books and comics (a lone hero or band takes on a corrupt larger power in a post apocalyptic setting) \\"Girl\\" quickly becomes less a movie than a \\"motion comic book\\".  (In many scenes, the film uses comic art to document the action.)Rebecca is a flighty type - into old movies (starring Doris Day), songs (later on, she forces the evil Madam to sing Cole Porter's \\"Let's Make Love\\") and just about everything that had been pre-modern before civilization was destroyed.  Captured by WP, Rebecca is used as bait by the evil WP Boss, to lure in the \\"Rippers\\".  The evil WP boss, Keslee (Malcom McDowell using his tried&true evil routine) knows that the Rippers (who tear through WP installations as if they didn't exist) are his only obstacles to total power.  Unfortunately, the bait works better than the trap - the Rippers appear, but destroy all the WP troops and severely injure Keslee.  Rebecca is freed, and stealing one of WP's tanks, sets off across the desert to reunite with her commune and revenge herself against WP.  Ofcourse, being Rebecca, nothing she does is straight - requiring her to dress her tank up much as she's costumed herself.  With the help of \\"Jet Girl\\" (the always satisfying Naomi Watts), Rebecca tears up the terrain and seems to have a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, Keslee remains alive and figures a way to use Rebecca to bring the Rippers to him - again.<br />I guess they realized thayhad to go the glam route because \\"Girl\\" had such a derivative story.  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't really know how to turn Rebecca's flamboyance into a story in itself.  Lori Petty gets some cool zingers (her own face is a special effect - as in the scene when she first sees her tank, played against the theme to \\"Shaft\\"), but the script decides against trying to be both funny and exciting at the same time.  This is one of those films that makes perfect sense until it's over.  By the time the credits are rolling, you're probably asking yourelf \\"what the....?\\"
6305089957|4.0|I saw Scream when it came out, but waited to see this one, not because it looked bad, just never got the chance.  After finally seeing it, I was pretty impressed.  Of course everyone knows the general idea that sequels are never as good as the original, and, well, maybe that is the case here as well, but the second doesn't dissapoint either.  I will keep this short and to the point, but everyone who has seen the first Scream knows the basic plot, and it is continued here, however if you have not seen the first, do see it, because without it you will be pretty lost.<br />I enjoyed this film because it was cleverly written, in that it makes references to other areas of the &quot;real world&quot; and other movies, and they are fun to pick up on.  However, it loses a star from me because of the ending.  Not who the killer or killers were but, just the way the last scene was played out.  The running around on stage (without giving away who the killers were) just wasn't beleivable to me.  And the bricks falling on top of them? Come on, it just looked fakey and turned me off a little bit, from what should be just about the most important scene of the movie, the ending, so for this, it loses a star fro me.<br />However, it is still a pretty well done film and will keep you guessing who the killer is, like the first, so for that it is entertaining and worth seeing! Hope you enjoy!

B00005O3VC|4.0|As you may already know, this DVD was released with a serious defect back in November of 2001. Subtitles would pop up randomly whether you had them turned on or not. After numerous complaints, Columbia Tri-Star Home Entertainment fixed the problem and sent out the corrected discs. Unfortunately, they did NOT recall the bad shipment (just like Anchor Bay with Heathers), and there is nothing on the box to indicate which version is which. Ah, but there is a way to distinguish the two. The initial shipment had a sticker, in the lower left-hand corner, advertising &quot;VIP MOVIE POINTS - Buy and Bid!&quot; The newer, corrected version, does NOT have this sticker. Hope that helps everyone out. As far as the first Swedish subtitle being omitted, it was like that on the theatrical re-release, too. So who knows? Now, as far as the DVD goes...wow. This is a Monty Python fan's dream come true. Oh sure, the transfer is far from perfect, and the 5.1 sound wouldn't impress your grandmother. It is still leaps and bounds ahead of the VHS (ugh!) release, and the extra features are too numerous to mention here. (I believe they are listed at the top of this page.) Really, the only drawbacks are the missing subtitle at the beginning and the fact that there are two versions out there; one defective, the other not. But at least now you know how to distinguish them. Just another helpful tip from your uncle Jason.
0451169514|3.0|I read the book when I was younge,r and although i got interested in it and finsihed it, i relaly didnt have very much idea of what it was about. so thne of course i saw the movie, (whihc i recomend doing before reading)and that cleared things up. Let me say thta if you are looking to be scared, i doubt IT will scare you, because I have read muhc of his novels and been scared and this one, wel, I guess I wasnt even scared a little bit. This book, to me at least, is a bit hard to understand and WOWZERS! SEX! lots of sex, so if you dont like sex, i dont recomend this book to you. of course reading any of Kings novels is always great, and I dont mena to say that this books bad,I'm jsut saying you may be disspointed. But, its worth reading! ;)
0140186395|5.0|This novel by Steinbeck easily won me over the first time reading it. The wording of this book is simple yet interestingly complex. Throughout the novel, you are introduced to 2 main generations between two interacting families, the Hamiltons and the Trasks. Most of this novel though is focused on the brotherly rivalry the Trask brothers, of both generations, experience. A wedge that drives the brothers apart is the continual struggle for the love of their Father. <BR>The brotherly rivalry described through the description of both generations parallels greatly with the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Also a very interesting biblical term, timshel, thou mayest, is mentioned several times during this book advocating the CHOICE for oneself. This book is extremely enjoyable to read!
0553801481|5.0|I've read all robin hobb's (coooome ooon next book) and the farseer trilogy just had such (well I thought so) a sad ending and so I was oooover the mooooon (ok i'll quit with the long o's) and so cos I already knew about Fitz I found it really relaxing just to read about his current life, and god the fool is so the best he had me in hysterics at one particular point in the book!
B0000636UN|2.0|I was always a fan of Sheryl Crow. She had good taste, she worked hard and, above all, wanted a musical evolution. In this record you can expect a kind of &quot;sell out music&quot;( the first single tells it all). I never expected Sheryl Crow to become a such &quot;teenager commercial&quot;, almost like the pseudo-pop songs of Britney Spears. Only good to children with less than 17 years old...
B000005TRO|5.0|I'm Bruce B. Of Cebu Philippines.I heard the song loneliness way back 1995,I was in third year high school then at that time and only one FM station was playing loneliness in our place.It was indeed a hit song here that made this particular FM station popular for playing loneliness. Now 7 yrs had past and loneliness is still a hit song in our City but the only difference is that its played to more than 7 stations catering to classes A-C. I hope this song will not just be heard in Cebu but also to the other parts of our country and to other countries as well.  Every time I hear this song it &quot;makes my hair at the back of my napes stands&quot; the song is perfectly made from the heart and the voice of Laura perfectly match with this song.  The Title &quot;loneliness&quot; might be something hard but then it speaks of reality, it speaks of acceptance and truth and how to deal with it. . . . . .<BR>Thank you so much Laura for this wonderful song!
B000066C1N|5.0|A number of great new songs of Bryan are awesome! Since So Far So Good, Adams has really made his comeback to to the big audiance. Besides, the best score-composer ever, Hans Zimmer proofs again he is still creative with his orchestra and musicians. The score is awesome good, better because he composed also some tracks for Adams which results in a great album. My advice: Buy it, don't try it!!! Don't download this album from the net, it's a waste of your time and critical listening. I love you Hans!
B000062TU1|2.0|I believe that this DVD has confirmed my place in the muggle population. While I am sure that many of harry's pre-teen fans are thrilled to have to play games to get to certain features on the bonus disk I eventually turned off the player in disgust after easter egg hunting for half an hour. While this movie is meant to be a &quot;kids&quot; film, I think that the DVD producers could have taken hints from other DVD's marketed mainly to the younger portion of the population (eg Disney movies) that have games, for those viewers interested in playing, separate from things such as featurettes and deleted scenes, so that those who are either uninterested in playing games or just too much of a muggle to figure them out can enjoy the extras just the same.I am really disappointed. I love the books and the movie, but this DVD is nothing like I hoped it would be.
B000002BFL|5.0|If you are a long time Springsteen fan, you should own this without question.  If you like Springsteen but don't own Nebraska or Darkness on the Edge of Town, buy those first.  If you don't like depressing music, or are looking for a rock cd, steer clear.<br />   Nebraska is still Springsteen's best album, dark though it is.  Tom Joad doesn't come close in my estimation, for four reasons: 1. Nebraska has a sound that is much more uniquely Springsteen's, whereas Joad sounds like an attempt to imitate Dylan and Guthrie; 2. Nebraska is much more melodic; 3. whereas Nebraska is extremely dark, it contains some note of hope and pleasure (eg, Open All Night, Reason to Believe), while Joad is almost unrelentingly depressing; and 4. while Nebraska sticks to it's theme, Joad ends with the truly awful and meaningless &quot;My best was never good enough&quot; - the only dud on the cd.   <br />  That being said, this cd contains some of the best lyrics Springsteen has written.  If you are a fan, it is an experience that will enrich your life, and you shouldn't pass up.<br />An aside: several reviewers are hung up on the issue that Springsteen is rich, but singing about the poorest of the poor. I suppose he shouldn't be writing about ex-cons and murderers either, since he's never killed anyone or served time.  Maybe someday we'll learn the shocking truth that Springsteen drove under the speed limit all through the 70s!  The work should be judged on its merits, not the lifestyle of the artist - that goes for all art.  If the work is sincere and effective, nothing else matters.
0140186395|5.0|I was never an avid reader of the Bible but this classic rendition of the old book's makes me want to sit down and read over the original stories again and again. Steinbeck achieves greatness through his tale of two families whose fates are intertwined and destinies preordained by the Bible itself.<br />Although the chapter organization seemed jumbled as if the chapters were somehow mixed in a strange order,however, the sheer insight emanating from Lee and Samuel Hamilton always made me hungry for more.<br />The lack of character development in Cathy (or Kate) is somewhat frustrating as it lead me to question why she kept reverting back to her previous ways when she's better off leaving them behind but she proves to be critical to the forced development of the weakened Adam Trask and also aids critically in the joining of the Hamiltons and the Trasks.<br />I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  It's guaranteed that East of Eden will move you and maybe even change your outlook on life.
B00005YXZH|4.0|I admit that I've not been a big fan of Wilco tunes when Tweedy and Jay Bennett colaborated together.  That's why A.M. has always been my favorite disc by Wilco, up until now.  Wilco is probably the best band that many people have never heard of.  I've enjoyed Son Volt/Jay Farrar few a number of years, but never checked out Wilco.  My loss!  This is a great CD that people should listen too.  It proves that good music doesn't need angry, pierced and tatooed kids shouting and pseudo-rapping to heavy metal music!
0380789035|3.0|Shadow is released after three years of his assault sentence for good behavior, only to find his wife and best friend died in the same car accident immediately before his release.  His friend's widow tells Shadow that the two of them were engaged in flagrante delicto, at the time.  Shadow can't ponder his losses, however, because an enigmatic con-man named Mr. Wednesday has hired him to be his personal driver and bodyguard on an unstated mission for an unstated duration.  It isn't long before Shadow is surrounded by former gods now down on their luck, who Mr. Wednesday is busy recruiting for an all-out final showdown with the new gods who supplanted them  -  the gods of Media, Fast Food, Shopping Malls, Computers, and the like.  Shadow's dead wife keeps coming back to him, gradually looking and smelling less pleasant, and he gets abducted and beat-up a lot by Men In Black with names like &quot;Mr. Wood&quot; and &quot;Mr. Stone,&quot; who are out to vanquish Wednesday.<br />If any of this sounds intriguing or amusing, then this is the book for you, because technically, that's about all that happens in this novel.  It has a story with a reasonable conclusion, but  -  like Lord of the Rings  -  its destination is the journey itself, and it never really arrives anywhere.<br />What this book is, essentially, is a Jack Kerouac road trip across America, filled with bizarre characters, humorous perceptions and anecdotal stories.  It has less of a plot than a point, and as such is pretty much a one-joke show with variations on a central theme.  The characters are entertaining, but pretty superficial.<br />But, most importantly, it's just plain fun.  It tells numerous funny stories and jokes, with the familiarity of an old friend.  It isn't really deep at all, despite appearances to the contrary, though it might sufficiently lull you with laughter to accidentally slip an interesting idea or two into your head for later mulling-over.<br />Most recommended for travelers  -  especially those undertaking a long road trip.pecially those undertaking a long road trip.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Chocolat is one of those rare and solid gems of the cinema that is well-written and well-crafted with a message that offers substance to the audience.<br />As with the main character's creations, Chocolat is rich from start to finish.  The cinematography is marvelous.  The acting is solid and engaging.  And the flow of the story is nearly flawless.  <br />At the core of the message of the film is that life is something to be richly savoured and that faithfulness has more to do with love than with slavish adherence to drab piety.  Chocolat does not refute the basic beliefs of the people of the French town that is the film's setting.  Rather, it blows apart their own misunderstanding of how to live those beliefs.  Moreover, the story opens up the door to the mystery and ambiguity of life lived not by rigid prescriptions and proscriptions -- but by the fierce embrace of life and love itself.  When new life comes to this French town, it comes as a wild flower...and it is anybody's guess as to how it will cover the landscape.<br />At times, the critique of religion is a bit naive.  This is probably its 'worst' flaw.  But it can hardly be counted as a big flaw in the film.  <br />Chocolat gets my strong recommendation to all who love film.  Superb.
0142000655|4.0|Have you ever read a book that you can't keep down?  East of Eden is that book.  East of Eden is an amazing story by John Steinbeck.  He incorporates biblical themes from Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel.  His characters portray good and evil and the importance of control.  The plot twists keep you turning pages.  It is exciting to see the development of Cathy, Adam, Cal, Aron, and Lee.  However, the orginization was less than satisfactory.  Steinbeck would reach a climax then switch to another topic.  Other than that, East of Eden is another phenomenal piece written by Steinbeck.

I know that Em and ICP don't like each other and I'm a ICP and Eminem fan but I have to say that Em is the best. Buy this album if you want to hear good music.
0684833395|5.0|There are parts in this book that made me laugh out loud. And it made me think. Books don't normally affect me that way. So there is something special about this book. <br />When I finished  \\"Catch-22,\\" I had to tell somebody about the book The urge to talk about it was strong.<br />You always want to talk about grand realizations. Reading this book is one of life's grand realizations. There is no other novel like it in any other country. It is uniquely American.<br />We all know the story. Yossarian's story. We all know about  Snowdon. We all know about Milo Minderbinder. And about Major Major.<br />What happens to them at the end of the book? They disappear. They all disappear. That realization made me sit up and take notice.<br />When I was in Vietnam, my closest buddies went home before I did. They all went home at different times in those hot thirteen months. Until I  was the only one left  in Nam in my unit who remembered the past.<br />Something like that happens in \\"Catch-22.\\" Yossarian is the only one left at the end of the book. But he also disappears in the last sentence: \\"He took off.\\"<br />You are probably wondering where I am going with this. It is simply this: People you are close to today disappear tomorrow.<br />Someone always moves, leaves the job, gets divorced, dies, and so on. You look around you and you wonder where did everybody go to? That was what I asked when I finished \\"Catch-22.\\"<br />\\"Catch-22\\" is a fast read. It will leave you full of excitement. It is like drinking champaign: it leaves you feeling very bubbly.  I envy the person who is reading it for the very first time.
0743216458|4.0|I actually read this after seeing the HBO series. The HBO series is very close to the book. The book has a little more to it. Great docu-movie on WWII following the 101st Airborne. Not just war scenes (which are very good), but you get into the thoughts and lives of the troops.
0060506989|4.0|I just bought this book two weeks ago and I couldn't put it down! Just reading the Prologue made me cry.  I haven't watched the movie yet but I can't wait till it comes out at the military post in Korea...I also can't wait to watch it because that lil' ...Barry Pepper is gonna be in there! He is so fine~! \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is the next best war movie next to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" except I think \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is based on a true story.
6305165912|5.0|If you like your humor to slap you in the face or, at least, not to require you to watch and think, don't buy this movie. On the other hand, if you like your humor witty, understated, allusive and often about \\"guys\\" (as opposed to \\"men\\"), this movie is one that you should take with you if you are ever planning to be marooned on a desert island, because you can (and should!) watch it over and over, and it just keeps getting better. The pattern is set in the first scene, when the \\"Dude\\" (Jeff Bridges), without embarrassment, writes a check for 69 cents for groceries! Such a simple device says so much, which is borne out and developed as the film progresses. With strong echoes of Alan Taylor's \\"Palookaville\\" and other films of the genre, this is a story about males of the species and their relationships - how they can foul up ridiculously time after time, apparently care only for the most trivial things (booze, bowling), yet still depend upon and support each other. The genius of the Coen brothers' writing is to maintain the credibility and interest of the disjointed, and sometimes surreal, plot. Bridges and John Goodman (as \\"Walter\\") are superb, with knockout support from the minor roles, especially John Turturro (\\"Jesus\\", a latino pedophile who likes to bowl, and manages to bring the kinky menace of his pedophilia to his bowling) and Julianne Moore (\\"Maud\\", an outrageously pretentious artist of female sexuality who lives with a splendidly camp and ineffectual Liverpudlian ninny (\\"Noss Harrington\\", a \\"video artist\\")). Some humorous scenes are classics that will reliably raise a laugh a long time after the movie is over (\\"Walter\\" wrecking a new Corvette with a tire lever, thinking that it belongs to a recalcitrant teenager, only to be set upon by the large, middle-aged owner; \\"Walter\\" biting off a nihilist's ear and launching it, in slo-mo, vertically into the night). In the end, the plot matters less than the people, in whose bungling, indiscretions and vanities manyviewers will recognize themselves.
B00000IMYA|5.0|This CD set is a classic. <br />Ellington's band sounds great. The solos by Johnny Hodges and Paul Gonsalves are amazing. <br />The live recording is perfect; the sound is so clean that I feel as if I'm there on the grass at Newport in 1956.<br />If I'm ever stranded on an island, I want these CDs with me.
B00005Y23E|5.0|There is a reason that Legend is the best selling reggae album of all time - simply put, it contains 14 (now 16+) of the best tracks of the best artist of the entire genre.  The music on this CD will take you to another place, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.  The Legend album is an essential component to any music collection.<br />This expanded edition is great for serious Marley fans and collectors, but is not highly recommended for casual fans.  The second disc is full of remixes and expanded versions that are definite treats and quite enjoyable, but not essential listening.  If you are new to reggae and only want the absolute best, stick with the single disc remastered version of Legend - which is improved over the original version by adding two key bonus tracks - Easy Skanking and Punky Reggae Party (both well deserving to be included as some of Marley's best tracks) - and superior remastered sound. It's cheaper and provides the essential look at the Legend of Bob Marley. Even if you're a casual fan who is loaded and don't mind shelling out big bucks for music, I would recommend that you splurge and get the Songs of Freedom 4 CD set, which provides a more comprehensive overview of the artist's entire career than this 2 CD set.<br />The liner notes of the expanded edition (and the single disc remastered edition) consist of a 28 page booklet containing the lyrics to the 16 tracks on the first CD.  The lyrics are helpful to new fans of Marley, as his Jamaican accent can have you wondering what exactly he is singing about. <br />One Love!
B00005QIPH|5.0|I had to buy this album twice because my first CD got scratched and beaten up by being played so much within one month!  I usually avoid overplaying a great CD in fear of growing tired of it, but I just can stop listening to this one.  I just hope that there is MORE to come from this band.  Thank goodness for rock music!!
B000059ZT4|5.0|This deluxe edition of Bob Marley and the Wailers' debut on Island Records is an absolute gem and must have for the serious Marley fan, but casual fans beware - you might get burned.<br />The two CD set, consisting of the previously unreleased original Jamaican version as recorded by Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers and the album as remixed and released by Cris Blackwell on Island Records, shows the creative musical genius of Marley - indeed, the original version is arguablly the better of the two.  The liner notes, consisting of a 28 page booklet, provide all the lyrics along with an insightful essay by Richard Williams and numerous pictures.  Hardcore dedicated Marley fans will love this set.<br />But at a price.  <br />Casual fans on the other hand will be burned by this deluxe edition, when the single disc remastered version containing the bonus tracks High Tide or Low Tide and All Day All Night may be all you need, at about half the price.  These two songs were the only two songs on the original Jamaican version that didn't make the cut to be included on the previously released album.  For the life of me, I can't understand why High Tide or Low Tide was left off in the first place.  This beautiful song of faith and friendship (which was previously included only on the Songs of Freedom box set)is perhaps one of my favorite Marley tunes.  And it's now available on the lower priced single CD remastered version of Catch a Fire.  If you pick up that single CD, you get all of the songs, just not all of the alternate versions.  But that is still enough to satisfy the casual fan.<br />For those who must have it all, this Deluxe Edition is worthy of all five stars.<br />Jah Live!
B000000XB9|5.0|Not familiar with the works of CCR? Then this greatest hits collection is a perfect introduction. The songs are well sequenced and have aged extremely well..but then, so do most rock songs. There are about 3 songs on &quot;Chronicle&quot; which I could care less for, but 20 hits is a healthy serving of classic material. Do yourself a favor and just get it.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Here's the scene:  I'm a relatively sane, socially adept woman of twenty-something, sitting with a friend in a crowded (and I mean, crowded) movie theater in November 2001.  I'm surrounded by toddlers, tykes, kiddies, pre-teens, etc. etc.  My friend is not a child, so instantly we stick out like sore thumbs, two adults in a children's movie.  For 2+ hours, I in J.K. Rowling's inspired world.  I was living at Hogwart's.  I was practicing my wizardry (although, at this stage, only with the popcorn).  I was LIVING HARRY POTTER.  Can I give this movie more than 5 stars?  It was fabulous.  And now, I can see it over and over and over again at home!<br />(And, yes, I know all about the Lord of the Rings vs. Harry Potter debate.  Lord of the Rings was a better movie technically -- not as in special effects technical, but as in movie-making-as-an-art technical.  But you know what?  I wanted to BE Harry Potter after the movie.  Not so with Frodo Baggins.  Sorry all you Tolkein fiends!)
B000063UR2|4.0|I got this movie because I had it on v.h.s. and wanted it on d.v.d.  it comes with two versions.  The director's cut and the theatrical version.  I started watching the director's cut and almost fell asleep.  There was too much added that didn't capture the feeling of the movie.  I didn't think that Mia Sara needed to sing to the unicorn in order for it to be charmed by her.  I also prefer the theatrical version's soundtrack.  It was more powerful.
0449227421|5.0|This book is filled with suspense,rape and crime and finishes with an extrordinary and suprising ending.  This was the seventh Ken Follett book I had read and I definitly compared it to The Key to Rebecca, Lie Down with Lions and Code to Zero. <BR> ... The Third Twin has great characters a deep plot and interesting facts about genetics and test-tube babies.  A Follett must-read!
B00003CXXJ|3.0|I really liked this movie in the theater, but when it came out on DVD I found that the movie felt dated and no longer as funny as it was!  I still enjoy it though! Especially Donkey! However,this DVD is the bane of my DVD collection!  If you want to enjoy any of the special features, you better know which disc you want. It is annoying to have to keep switching from disc to disc just to see all of them. I Think that this is one of the worst and most overrated DVD's to come out in recent years (see Harry Potter for another one!) The movie is ok, the DVD stinks! My suggestion: if you liked the movie, get the DVD, but be prepaired to be really annoyed!
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is hilarious! Your mother was a hampster and your father smelled of elderberries!!
B000063UR2|5.0|As a fan of the orginal Pan &amp; Scan home video version, I was excited to hear of this new cut, something I had never seen!  Boy, it was one great movie! Both versions are just great and wonderful to watch, the director's cut being the better of the two with lots more things happening. Wow!  Even the special features do not disappoint. Plus it's in WIDESCREEN! Yeah! If you are a fan of the movie, get it now, and get ready for one great disc!
B00005YXZH|5.0|I enjoy this album very much. He has come so far since Uncle Tupleo. There is a bit more techno....matured a bit like U2 has over the past few years.<br />Still does not fit into the standard molds. More progressive than Americana or alt.country that I have heard recently. But a couple of songs remind me of The Lemonheads...makes me like them more.
B000068CNX|5.0|I'm happy that i own FRIENDS DVD the first season and now i'm going to own the second season and i hope all the season come out so i can order them to and could have all the season..<BR>MAN I can't wait for all the season to come out becouse i LOVE FRIENDs...
B00006690F|4.0|Eminem's official third solo album (technically, it's his 5th) is the best one yet. He is a lyrical genius. If you aren't ignorant, and just think he is nasty, listen to the lyrics, they are meaningful, and they are very well written. His newest single isn't that good anymore, since radio has played it out.<BR>Here is a track-by-track review of the CD.<br />1. Curtains Up- 2 stars<BR>This isn't really a track, just a skit to start it out. He just clears his throat.<BR>2. White America- 4 stars<BR>This is a great song, telling about how people just like and listen to his music because he is white. Definitely to be concidered as a single. Good beat.<BR>3. Business- 5 stars<BR>This is one of my favorite songs on the album. It has a great beat, and for some reason, I hear myself singing the chorus to myself. Very catchy! Makes fun of a lot of stuff.<BR>4. Cleaning Out My Closet- 4 1/2 stars<BR>This is a great song, has a good beat. About him talking about his mom is crazy, and he is moving out and cleaning out his closet.<BR>5. Square Dance- 4 stars<BR>I like this song, has a good beat, and is funny sort of. Makes fun of people with a southern accent. Makes fun of Cannibus on it. ....<BR>6. The Kiss- 3 stars<BR>A skit re-making the \\"alleged\\" incident when Kim was accused of kissing John Guerra, and Eminem pistol whipped him.<BR>7. Soldier- 3 1/2 stars<BR>Okay song, with okay beat. I don't really like this song too much<BR>8. Say Goodbye To Hollywood- 4 stars<BR>Talks about Kim, and stuff like that. Good beat, well written.<BR>9. Drips- 4 1/2 stars<BR>Great beat, well written. Talks about Kim cheating on him and getting diseases, and giving it to him.<BR>10. Without Me- 3 1/2 stars<BR>The song everyone knows. I don't really listen to it, since you just turn on the radio, and it's on. Okay song, mediocre beat. Good when it is new though.<BR>11. Paul- 1 star<BR>... there really is no point to it.<BR>12. Sing For The Moment- 5 stars<BR>Excellent beat, very well written. Itis meant to be a song to hear when you're in a happy mood.<BR>13. Superman- 4 1/2 stars<BR>Great song. I like the beat, and it has great lyrics. You should definitely listen to this track.<BR>14. Hailie's Song- 4 stars<BR>This is a nice song, with a good beat, and well written. Dedicated to Hailie, Eminem's daughter. You should like this song too. Good rap after the song.<BR>15. Steve Berman- 2 1/2 stars<BR>This is the same stuff as the past two albums, except that he actually likes the album instead of hating it. You hear \\"Ain't Nuttin But Music\\" from D-12's album \\"Devil's Night\\".<BR>16. When The Music Stops- 4 1/2 stars<BR>This song features D-12. Has a great beat, should be listened to.<BR>17. Say What You Say- 4 stars<BR>This song features Dr. Dre. It is good because he produced this track. Eminem and Dre songs are good mostly.<BR>18. Till I Collapse- 3 1/2 stars<BR>This song is a little weaker than previous tracks. Features Nate Dogg. Has a good beat, but Nate Dogg is only in the chorus. He should have been in a little more.<BR>19. My Dad's Gone Crazy- 4 stars<BR>This song has a good beat, well written. Features Hailie Mathers! You hear her in some parts during the song wheh she said \\"I think my dad's gone craazay!\\" About when Eminem is acting weird and Hailie thinks Eminem has gone crazy.<BR>20. Curtains Close- 5 stars<BR>This is so much better than Curtains Open. A hilarious track featuring the one and only Ken Kaniff! Here is what he says, mocking \\"Without Me\\".<br />Guess who's back/Back again/Ken is back/Tell some men/Rub my back/Rub my back...<br />You need to buy this CD! I would have given it 4 1/2 stars, but you can only give whole numbers. You should definetely buy this CD if you like Rap music. I really like this CD.
0385335482|5.0|All I could think of when I read this book as well as &quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan&quot; was that these are the two best novels I have EVER read! Bravo to Sophie Kinsella she is brilliant in how she covers the dramaticness behind the addiction of shopping. It was her writings that made me want to write a novel myself, which I have now started. Thank you Sophie!
B0000640VO|5.0|This is the best film I have ever seen.  I cannot say enough about how wonderful this film is, but I will try.  Audrey Tautou is the most beautiful, magnetic, spellbounding, and (insert any other positive superlative adjectives here) actress since Audrey Hepburn.  My only hope is that Hollywood never gets its filthy hands on her.  Jean-Pierre Jeunet's style sucks you in completely. The supporting cast also give excellent performances.  I was worried that I would not get the French sense of humor going into this movie,  but I quickly found out that would not be the case.  If you watch this movie you will not quit smiling for days, I kid you not.  Watch Amelie with someone you love.
B00005MAM2|5.0|...but sommday we are to be abel to. Because it has allready begon.<br />This is not the first Anime i saw. I might not even be the best. But it's a damm good example what Animes are capable of. The Animation is (even on todays standards) breathtaking. The Carakters are great and threedimentional. And most importand of all, the story, what a powerhouse...<BR>It excelently combins the very personal part (the friendship between Kaneda and Tesuo) with an apocalyptic - end of days - part. Both work perfectly. <br />It's full of action, suspence, great dialogue and a lot of psychology & philosophy. <BR>It's a story of friendship, loss, sufferring, lonlyness, fear, anger and all the other aspects of human emotions. <br />But as all other great things, Akira cant intierly explaind. It must be seen... So go and see for yourselfe what Akira is about.
B000000WFZ|5.0|Of the most captivating soundtracks I've ever heard, truely worthy of the wonderous movie to which it is attactched.  The Mission is a movie, as good as it is, that is virtually forgotten, and with it is this wonderous soundtrack.<br />Let me start off by saying the movie to which this soundtrack is attatched is one of the best I've ever witnessed.  <br />That said, with the masterpiece he has composed, Ennio Morricone has come to rival John Williams with this spellbinding soundtrack.  Morricone didn't recieve an Oscar for his work, but in my opinion is quite deserving of one.  The blend of chants and music makes the piece flow perfectly, as perfect as the river that was the centerpiece of the film.<br />The soundtrack ranges from the depressing, to the soothing, to the uplifting.  A perfect blend.<br />My only regret is this product has been virtually forgotten amounst its peers, but to the few who find it, it is of the most rewarding soundtracks available.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Artifacts in the video (softness and motion) and the limited playback options on the MAC (Harry and company are surely wizards of the apple platform) make this release a disappointment. Compared to something like the Sony SuperBit technology used to author the DVDs for 'Crouching Tiger' and 'AI' Warner Bros should never have cut costs in the production of this DVD.  What gives with the multiple proof of purchase tabs in the package?  Are they going to offer discounts on the future releases if JKR gets around to finishing the series.  As Blake said, 'Damn braces, bless relaxes'.  Hopefully she's still driven enough to finish the series.
B000002OOY|5.0|John Williams is, without a doubt, the best composer of movie soundtracks ever.  What is disputable, however, is which soundtrack is his best work.  Some say it's Star Wars, others E.T., and yet others Indiana Jones, but I say that it's Jurassic Park.<br />I vividly recall going to see Jurassic Park on opening day when I was still in kindergarten.  The movie was perhaps the most captivating and spellbinding I've seen.  The sight of realistic looking dinosaurs interacting with humans is the most inspiring  sight a young boy could hope to witness.  This inspiration, this sense of wonder and intrigue, is perfectly captured within John William's soundtrack.<br />The uplifting melody stays with you long after the music is finished.  Whether or not you liked the movie, I can virtually guartentee you you will like the soundtrack. <br />Somewhere around the seventh track you realize that this music is as close to perfection as Williams has ever gotten.
B00006690G|5.0|This is definitly the best Eminem CD to date.  There is so much anger that is released in it that it's unreal!  All of the tracks are good, I can't even decide which is my fav.  Buy it now!
B00005TT77|4.0|i really like this cd, but that's not why i'm writing this review.  i just had to respond to the other reviewers who tell you not to purchase this album b/c the covers don't sound like the originals.  that is just about the stupidist reason to avoid a tribute album that i've ever heard!  if you want to listen to the originals then listen to the originals.  these songs aren't performed by beatles cover bands (thank god!).  they are performed by mostly talented artists who were influenced (who isn't) by the beatles, and recorded versions of their favorite songs with a twist of their own personal styles.  if i had anything to complain about on this album it's that almost none of the artists did anything different with the songs.  only the brilliant version of revolution by grandaddy really &quot;revolutionized&quot; any of the material.  i don't say this to be disrespectful of the beatles.  i'm crazy about the beatles, but if you're going to bother recording a cover of a song, do something different with it.  you're never going to sound exactly like the beatles, so why bother trying; do your own thing.
B00005Y228|5.0|This CD is great fun to listen to.  If you ever need something light, fun and peppy to listen to, this is it. Not one song on the CD sounds the same, they all are different, yet all share her awesome sound.  I'm not a huge fan of pop music, but this is so different (i.e. more mature) than any of the pop music out there from the likes of um, say Britney Spears.  If you ever want something to get you out of a slump and moving, this is the CD that will do it!

Especially if you're a teen, you can understand what it's like having to deal with a parent who just wants to do what's best for you, but you just want to be left alone.<br />It's a great family movie, about a vacation gone wrong, but when you think it was bad, it actually turned out good.<br />It has great catchy music, the plot thickens, it's a great kids movie that you can watch over and over and over again.<br />Buy it now, you won't be disappointed, after all we all love cartoons, especially Disney!
B00006690F|3.0|Not a great CD.  I just can not get into the songs.  As always his lyrical delivery is awsome, but the most of the songs are slow and unfullfilling.  Best to me are Without me , and Bussiness.  ...  I wish he had used more hook songs because him and Dre can Delivery on that side.  Not bad, not great.

This is EMINEM people, but now with this CD, this is the best rapper ever, no doubt.<BR>    Peep the way the man flows over every beat, EM can rock a beat better than anyone, except maybe Tupac, but you can feel the influence here. Not one bad song, and the flows on track 5 and 18, is some of the illest shi* ever. And 14 he actually sings, and boy what an experience it is.

When master art thief Robert &quot;Mac&quot; MacDougal (Sean Connery) becomes entrapped in insurance investigator Gin Baker's (Catherine Zeta-Jones) devious game of international intrigue, the stage is set for the largest heist and biggest police sting in history. They've planned for every contingency, and covered every detail except one-the fevered attraction that's building between them, and a triple-cross that will shatter your illusions and leave you breathless.
B00005YXZH|3.0|This is an extrordinary album, but it's over-produced [for my taste].  Wilco's lyrics are phonemenal, but they often seem lost in the technics.  I wish to hear just Jeff Tweedy and the band, but I can live without all that interference.  It's annoying.  The over-production [to call it, loosely] has peed on this album.

6303369170|2.0|Johnny Depp is a young man who comes to Arizona to be his uncle Jerry Lewis' best man in his wedding, and stays on to sell cars at the local family Cadillac dealership. There, Depp and buddy Vincent Gallo meet up with Lili Taylor and her weird stepmother Faye Dunaway. Taylor and Dunaway hate each other, living in a big house in the country and arguing continuously. Depp eventually falls for Dunaway, and is drawn into her weird little world, where she dreams of flying, and moving to Papua New Guinea.<br />Taylor has her own set of mental quirks- she worships turtles and wants to kill herself so she can come back as one. Gallo fancies himself a serious actor, one good scene has him recreate the cropduster scene from \\"North by Northwest,\\" on stage at a local talent contest. Paulina Porizkova is given nothing to do as Lewis' very young fiancee.<br />We have all these weird characters in a weird little comedy. There are funny scenes. Taylor tries to hang herself with pantyhose from a second floor balcony, and bungees up and down as Depp tries to save her. Depp, Taylor, Dunaway, and Gallo play a hilarious game of footsie at a dinner table. Taylor, depressed over her suicide attempt, begins wandering around the house playing the accordian. Depp and Dunaway begin building flying machines, trying to fulfill Dunaway's girlhood dream. The screen fills with weird special effects and tons of magical realist images. The eskimo prologue; a fish that swims in the sky; really interesting stuff.<br />About halfway through the film, everything takes an ugly turn. Depp and Taylor play a game of Russian Roulette. Lewis overdoses on pills, he is guilt-ridden because he drove the car in the accident that killed Depp's parents. Eventually, not a whole lot of plot happens. Instead, the film becomes obsessed with suicide, wallowing in the characters' unhappiness to the point that I may remove the COMEDY sticker from the video case and write MANIC DEPRESSIVE on it.<br />The cast, especially Taylor, is good, too good. I felt like they really understood their respective characters and the director's overall vision. Too bad they did not let the viewer in on it. I felt undermined by the cast and crew, and could not wait for the film to end.<br />The final scene, on the tundra, has Depp and Lewis talking to each other in Eskimo native language while ice fishing. A confusing ending to a confused film. I do not recommend this one.<br />This is rated (R) for physical violence, gun violence, mild gore, strong profanity, sexual content, sexual references, and adult situations.
0345451325|4.0|Halo is an epic story that should be read by anyone who enjoyed the X-Box game of the same name. (Note - There were people who didn't enjoy it?) The basic story reminded me much of the Ender's Game series and it's progression is well done. Though the book jumps around a bit, the story is understandable and doesn't confuse you too much if you haven't played the game. I really enjoyed reading the book and after finishing it, I went straight to my X-Box and replayed the game. I believe that the book should be taken into serious consideration for filming a motion picture because with the recent news of a Crazy Taxi and Dead or Alive movie, the industry needs to make a movie based on a game that has a REAL storyline!! The book fleshes out the Halo universe and gives you a much more informed and respectful look on the Master Chief, whom you play as in the game, and Captain Keyes, whom you don't get to know much of in the game. Captain Keyes is especially interesting in the book and is quite tactically brilliant, though you are never shown his great ability in the game. If you liked the game and have unsolved answers or just want to read an enjoyable novel, you should read Halo: The Fall of Reach.
0345448898|3.0|I first enjoyed The Golden Compass by itself, and found it to be a compelling, well-developed story. I later read the second and third books in the trilogy and was both impressed by the detailed world created by Pullman and shocked by some of the apparent bias of the author. <br />Although I am a strong advocate for free-speech and I am happy that I read these books, I am also an adult who enjoys comparing differing religious viewpoints. For those who hold strong Judeo-Christian beliefs, this can be a very disturbing series. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND PARENTS OF CHILDREN UNDER 14 READ THESE BOOKS BEFORE THEY BUY THEM FOR THEIR CHILDREN. In my opinion, the books are a direct, literal attack on \\"God\\", and will likely raise questions that I believe should be discussed by families.<br />I am also upset that the author's bias does not appear until the second book, allowing readers (i.e. parents and teachers) to read the Golden Compass and determine it to be acceptable, referring young readers to it who then go on to the Subtle Knife and the Amber Spyglass on their own, without adult guidance on the issues raised.
6304712936|3.0|I saw the Director's Cut version in the theaters years ago and it's well worth the ticket price. The Director's Cut version fills in LOTS of things that happen in the film and the original 1987 version compared is very general and not as interesting after seeing the Director's Cut version. I give it four stars because the acting is good, great story, 2nd disc Making of..., and I love W.A. Mozart. Get the Director's Cut is all I say!
B000062XFG|3.0|The technical aspects of the DVD are superb but this series contains some real clunkers e.g. Shades of Gray and the Royale. I watched series 1 several times and each time managed to find new nuances and things to keep my attention but some episodes in the second series just fail to rivit ones attention having weak plots designed for... TV. I wish the BBC had given a fraction of the budget to the early Dr Who stories that would have been a show.<br />On the positive the debut of the Borg and the scene setting for the future make this an essential purchase if only to give the grand children an insight into late 20th Centuries view of the future.
B000003TA4|5.0|I think that anyone who does not recognize this as the greatest rock album of the nineties is a pure fool. ...Those bands certainly are precursors to Nirvana, but neither have the raw passion emotion and power of Nirvana. .... Nirvana was unique and poised to conquer nineties rock. This brilliant album, perhaps maligned by ignorant gen Y kids, is known by any intelligent music fan as a major achievement. Who cares if it was a multi million selling disc, if it was in the cut out bin,<BR>it would still be classic. ...
B00003CXDU|5.0|I had almost as much fun reading the reviews of this great flick as I had watching it.  I love it when we are in communion, which in fact is what being a FAN is all about: communing with others who share a common object of admiration.  I communed with the other reviewers, we communed with the filmmakers (who are obviously respectful fans of the Trek), and for 120 minutes, the world was in harmony.  The same thing happens when we go to the conventions, which we take seriously.  The same thing happens when a Trek movie is released and we camp out overnight to see it.  The irony is that it was all done through satire, which is often condescending, mean spirited, irreverent, and blind to the nature of true fandom.  This film works because the satire causes us to reflect, not feel ashamed; the satire causes us to laugh gently at ourselves and our heroes, not gag.  Finally, it is so adequately done that if the humor were removed, it could almost be a serious addition to the Trek.  Finally, the most touching aspect of the film is the forging of relationships: not only the actors among themselves and the actors with the aliens, but the actors with THEIR roles and the actors with their fans.  Notice that the captain is no longer bored, jaded with, or annoyed by the millions of fans who admire him.  In short, the actors are no longer a part of the cynical outsiders who are condescending, mean spirited, irreverent, and blind to the nature of true fandom.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Mad Men And English Dogs is the title of an album by Nigel Glockler/Doug Scarratt.If you like Satriani,you may like this album...Doug Scarratt is a very underestimated guitarist,he is also known for playing for Saxon.
0385335482|4.0|The day my friend told me about this book, I knew there was something about it that would make me want to read it really badly. Of course! I mean like, I love to shop (even though I don't do it a lot)! But my only problem is, is that when I shop, I get a lot of expensive things or i spend too much in a day. I thought this book may make me realize the dangers of my spending habits. Boy was I right! I loved this book! Rebecca's ditzy, amiable and fashionable personality was also a plus to this book! In some cases she reminded me of me. The only thing is, I don't have any credit cards to pay off. I also loved how the setting was in London. That's so high-fashion-like. And, the British terms in the book were cool!  But anyway, as you keep reading, you will notice a change in Rebecca's personality. It gives the book a nice touch. I totally recommend this book to people 13-14 and up. Just watch out for the language.
B000002UAO|5.0|I must admit at the beginning that this CD has a sentimental place in my heart as it was the first Beatles album I ever heard and I was instantly taken.  But the album that I first heard was not complete as this CD is.  Capitol had watered down the American releases at that point, cutting the number of tracks released.  So many in fact off of Rubber Soul and Revolver that they made a complete third album, Yesterday and Today from the cut material. <br />Imagine an album so strong that you could cut songs like &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; and &quot;What Goes On&quot;.  What a nice problem to have for a group.  But the Beatles were revolutionary.  <br />This British version of the original release presents the total project as it was meant to be heard, and how fabulous.  The American version in the sixties did offer the unique &quot;false start&quot; to &quot;I'm looking Through You&quot; which I must confess I miss from my youth.  But the trade off is well worth it to hear the entire album. <br />This was The Beatles first release of real, meaningful songs.  Songs from the heart as opposed to catchy, poppy tunes.  They were growing and so was their audience.  This album represented a turning point in their career.  It started the ball rolling for thought and they would follow with innovation.  Constantly pressing the barriers of acceptability in the music industry and society.  <br />The Beatles were exellent pickers for their time but it was in their arrangements and (underrated) harmonies and backing vocals that they shown like stars.  The song writing was so far ahead of the norm at that time.  Even edgy, as with &quot;Run For Your Life&quot; about warning your girlfiend about the dangers (from you) of cheating.  The fact that love conquers all (The Word) and on and on over many topics.  This album was released almost 40 years ago and the music still sounds fresh today!  <br />A great introduction to their music, buy it, and enjoy it for many years to come.
B00003CXI1|3.0|WARNING! The DVD claims to have 7 deleted scenes. You cannot access these scenes directly from the menu; instead, you will have to maze through an extremely poor &quot;interactive tour&quot; of the Harry Potter world to get to the deleted scenes. It took me about 30 minutes to do. What's worse, since DVD's can't &quot;save&quot; state, you'll have to do this every time you want to watch the deleted scenes. <br />This is just an irresponsible thing to do on a product consumers spend money for. As a free feature on a website, maybe. But on a DVD, no.
B000002UB6|4.0|Phil Spector mucked up a lot of the songs on here with his overproduction, but still, \\"One after 909\\" (a song dating from John and Paul's early days together) is one of the best Beatles rockers ever -- full of the best sort of lyrical nonsense -- and very underplayed.  And George's \\"For You Blue\\" is winsome, catchy and charming.  Two of my favorite Beatles cuts ever.
0451450523|5.0|I have never before found a book that so delicately wound its way into my heart and left me wanting more, even when the ending wasn't exactly happy. No other ending would have made so perfect a fairy-tale.<BR>Beagle himself admits to its fairy-tale status with his allusions to stereotypical characters such as \\"hero\\" or \\"witch\\", etc, and, I think, gets away with it by taking it far deeper than any other story I have ever seen. He guides each character gently across the chessboard of the story by showing a subtle futility in crossing fate mixed with an intriguing web of emotional interplay that is entirely unique. Schmendrick, Molly, Amalthea, Lir, and even Haggard have complex, colorful personalities that contrast wonderfully with the darkness of their circumstances and surroundings. Each one has a predetermined part, but it is theirs to play.<BR>Read it, I think you'll LOVE it. (the movie's not bad either)
B00004U8JU|4.0|The first and the best in the Jurassic Park series.This dvd is incredible.Just go right to the T-REX breakout scene to impress your friends . 'Crank it up'and enjoy outstanding movie making and best of all the sound production . This dvd has DTS Digital Surround Sound--just what the doctor ordered .
B00000IQMT|5.0|This has got to be one of the greatest movie soundtracks that I own.  The music that was put together for this movie is superb with a very rich sound.  I find listening to the scores that accompany many of the movie scenes provoke the same intrigue as watching the movie alone.  But John Williams really out did himself with much of this work.<br />I will not go into great detail on every song on the soundtrack.  However, I say this because I think every Star Wars fan should have this CD in their collection and hear it for themselves!  The first time I listened to this CD, I was impressed (and surprised that I missed it in the movie)with the foreshadowing that is present even in the music!  Now, we all know that little Ani is the future Darth Vader, but how cool of Williams to throw in a bit of the Imperial March in the background of Anakin's Theme.  And I would have bought this CD on Duel Of The Fates alone.  I could listen to that all day!
B000002UA0|5.0|First of all, I'll let it be known that I love Darkside-it was my first floyd album, and up until I heard Piper, my favorite.Anyway, when I heard about this album, I didn't go out and buy it right away, because being a Waters-Gilmore fan, I simply assumed that this was the old...Pink Floyd, something different than what I had grown to love-I naturally assumed that Floyd had risen to their musical hieght during the early -mid seventies, with darkside and wish, a popular view among Floyd fans.My GOD was I wrong!!!!After having listened to this album for months now, I can honestly say that this is the BEST Floyd album ever, and could very possibly be the BEST rock album in history.I'm not really even going to attempt to describe the music contained on this album- believe me, it is best left a mystery until the moment you put it in your cd player. At that point, if you approach this music with an open mind, and an open heart, you may discover something very special...about this music, about yourself, the universe....and no, you most certainly do not have to be on drugs to experience the beauty of this art.<BR>my two cents- its a masterpiece
B0000203YT|1.0|I'm still wondering the whole point of the movie to this very day. I mean, I get the whole \\"Shakespeare has some sorta 'writers' block' thing, and that this chick dresses up as a man to be in a play of his ...and they end up making steamy passionate love one nite...but damn! This movie was nominated for an Oscar...BR>...
B00006690G|4.0|My fave controversial hottie is back.  This CD is just as good as his last and I gotta say he's great in concert (I saw him live in Glasgow during the summer)...  He raps about reality so if you live in a dream world this is NOT the album for you.  He's bad but you gotta love him for his honesty and nerve.
0446310786|5.0|I loved this book. It seemed like I could relate very well with Scout, Jem, and Atticus. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes reading in general. I think it is one of the best books I have ever read. It is definetely in my top 5.
B00005K3LU|4.0|I couldn't wait to own this movie on DVD. Its a great-looking roller coaster ride filled with fantastic stunts and very slick villians, who are so much more interesting than the usual crop of mindless bullies seen in every other shoot-'em-up movie. The LAPD and FBI are the only thing keeping this movie from getting 5 stars from me. Seems like they could have done at least one thing right in the movie. <br />About the Special Features: As usual, the added scenes contributed nothing (that's why they were cut in the first place). The editing workshop was a joke. You really only get to pick from a choice of 3 takes to build a preset sequence which lasts maybe a few seconds. I stupidly assumed that I would get to lay down audio tracks, build my own sequence, you know, editing. Maybe they could expand this so it doesn't seem so much like a cheap gimmick for padding the features list. I did like the commentaries. They pointed out things I never noticed in the 20 times I've seen this movie.<br />Overall, a great thriller.
B000062TU1|4.0|I would. I do NOT think that the movie lived up to its true potential at all. I haven't actually revieved my DVD yet, but from what I saw of the movie, many scenes were left out. Also, the thing where they show Harry under the invisibility cloak was just plain stupid. it could have seriously been better.
B000058T5E|5.0|Jeff Beck never ceases to amaze me with his guitar playing. You Had it Coming is no exception. He is the greatest guitarist ever, and YHIC is another snapshot of what he can do. I say snapshot, because an album really only is a snapshot. It's live where an artist really shows what he can do.<br />This album is filled with enormous talent. Even if the more electronic approach isn't your thing, the guitar playing is great. Every one of Jeff's solos on this album is amazing. As said previously, his solo at the end of Left Hook is awesome. Nadia, of course, is the standout, and Jeff once again shows us he can drown Clapton with his guitar (not only his phrasings and ideas, but his tone as well). The guitar tone is quite good, and even better on this stuff live. <br />You Had It Coming is worth the money you have to pay for it.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|everyone i know (w/ few exceptions) absolutely adores this movie.  you have to laugh at it instead of thinking 'whats the point of this story?' its definitely a great movie that anyone who liked robin hood men in tights or o brother where art thou (et cetera) would love.  of course, maybe you'd like it anyway w/o liking those other films.  anyhoo, this is a great movie in which me and my friends cannot stop quoting from.  very hilarious, very awesome.  can u say orange mocha frappiccino?
B000055Y0X|5.0|\\"Dr Strangelove\\" is billed as a classic for a reason: it's flat-out one of the most intelligent and hilarious movies I've ever seen.  While the movie works as a satire of Cold-War paranoia and the level of American military preparedness, its true brilliance lies in its vividly drawn characters and endless supply of memorable dialogue.  Who can forget the mad General Jack D. Ripper (love that name), the rogue general obsessed with safeguarding the purity of America's bodily fluids?  Or Colonel Mandrake, the picture of English gentility, attempting to reason with raving Ripper?  Or Dr. Strangelove, constantly having to remember that the American president is not the Fuhrer?  Best of all, however, is the indelible image of George C. Scott as the ultimate hawk, General Buck Turgetson.  Whether telling the president that an all-out nuclear attack on Russia would result in \\"five, ten million casualties, tops\\" for America, or defending the defense protocols that may bring about world destruction, or raving that we \\"cannot allow a mineshaft gap!\\", General Turgetson is one of the most consistently hilarious characters in movie history, a caricature of the gung-ho attitude that so often leads to wars.  By dealing in a lighthearted manner with an issue as serious as nuclear war, Stanley Kubrick created an incisive, memorable and always hilarious masterwork.  Easily one of the top movies I've seen.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I must admit, I didn't like the film when I first saw it but after a few repeated viewings I found it growing on me. I have to say I'm glad the directors didn't stray from the book, the film is supposed to be the book in an alternate form...NOT rewriting of the work set on film. I do wish the directors hadn't hacked out so much of the funny stuff (i.e. most of Dean Thomas' and Fred &amp; George's comments) but the film was getting rather long as is. The DVD is essentially what a DVD should be...it has the film and a few extras. I have to say I LOATHE the second disc. It's a pain to go through so many steps to view the deleted scenes (and after you go through the effort you wonder why you bothered, they're nearly all from the same sequence), a majority of the &quot;tours&quot; are pointless, and the &quot;games&quot; are mind numbing. The makers could have spent a bit more on the package itself, cardboard breaks much more easily then the plastic alternative. Also the &quot;locks&quot; which hold the DVDs in place are too small and too tight, you nearly have to wrench the poor DVD out of its casing. I suggest Potter fans get the film, but don't expect anything amazing out of the special features
B000002IOJ|5.0|Right from the outset of the title track, &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot; is some roaringly infectious old school thrash.  With lots of ripping riffs, Chuck Billy's unmistakable howl, and just enough use of melody to please the ear, this is doubtless one of the underappreciated gems of the thrash era.  With the exception of the aptly titled &quot;The Ballad,&quot; the album never deviates from its formula of energetic, fist-pumping metal, with some top notch musicianship to boot; you especially have to love Alex Skolnick's blazing solos.  I'm not going to bother citing specific songs, as they're all excellent and I don't care for song-by-song reviews anyway.  In conclusion, BUY BUY BUY!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD is amazing! I just bought it this past week while I was out of town. When I got back home, I had my mom listen to it and she is absolutely in love with it too.  Norah's voice is beautiful and fits exceptionally well with the music.  The lyrics are marvelously writen. They tell stories that are realistic and artistic and interesting.  The music isn't always jazzy or always upbeat.  There is a great diversity in all the tracks and it keeps you interested.  She is a wonderful artist!
0792846710|4.0|Killer Klowns From Outer Space is a horror movie with a comedic twist. In one night, the small California town of Crescent Cove is terrorized by the Killer Klowns, an alien race of literal bloodsuckers from another planet. First seen at the Top of the World, a makeout hangout, by two lovers, Mike and Debbie, they decide to investigate the Klowns' circus tent spaceship. When they find that Joe Lombardo, one of Mike's friends, suffocated and cotton candy cocconed, was a victim of the Klowns' handiwork, they become a target, as does the rest of the town. A rookie cop becomes a believer in the Klowns only when he finds that everyone at the Top of the World has been killed by them, and later when he finds the body of a fellow officer and firm disbeliever in the Klowns, choked to death. Can the Klowns' murderous rampage be stopped before it's too late? Watch and find out.
0553801481|4.0|Okay first off I would like to state that I thought that this book was AWESOME! That being said on with the review.<br />Well I found myself more drawn to FitzChivarlys character more than ever. I really could understand his cynical attitude throughout the series. The only problem I had with this series that it ended to FAST and made you hanging at the end. In all contrast though the next book, &quot;Golden Fool&quot; is going to be over 600 pgs, which seems promising to me. <br />I gave this review four stars because I very rarely give most books a 5 unless it was out-standing and done well anymore. However it was very close to being a 5 star rating!
071198042X|4.0|What Peter Freestone has done here is dispel and/or correct the many rumours and myths surrounding the life of Freddie Mercury. It is not a straightforward biography, but an intensely personal account of the last twelve years of Mercury's life, during which time Peter Freestone was his personal assistant and close friend. Freestone still remains fiercely loyal and wants us to understand the sort of devotion that those close to Mercury gave to him. He describes not just a rock star and a legend, but a fascinating man who was, by all accounts, one of a kind. Readers hoping to hear about Mercury's early life will be disappointed, but those wanting a behind-the-scenes, what-he-was-really-like account will love this book, as I did.
B00003CXI1|5.0|As a Harry Potter fan, I'm so happy with this movie adaptation.  It's very true to the book (which is fabulous in my opinion, I don't know why some people complained about that), although there are some slight differences.  The movie makers have done a wonderful job bringing Rowling's world on screen.  The visual effects, especially Fluffy, ghosts, chess pieces, Quidditch game were done exceptionally well.<br />The second disc is all extras.  I guess it was designed for Harry Potter fans and people who enjoyed the movie very much because it was assumed that you've watched the movie beforehand.  The deleted scenes were a little hard to find since several steps have to be taken.  First I had to go to get the key and take money from the Gringotts bank in Diagon Alley.  Then purchase wand from Olivander's.  Then return to the school and attend classes.  Go to potions class and answer three questions.  The questions were a little bit of a hassle for me.  Answer for the 1st question: Aphrodel and the tube next to it (forgot name); 2nd question: wolfsbane and monkhood; 3rd question: snake fangs and porcupine quills.  After the questions, select winged key by trying out a few. Then select the orange colored potion and you will see the mirror of erised.  There are a total of 7 deleted scenes.  Although some will say they are not worth the hassle, but I liked them.  My other favorite extra is the interview.  It was good to learn about the behind the scenes interaction of the director/producer/actors etc and production of the movie in general.  They also mentioned something about the second movie.  <br />Overall good buy.  Worth every cent.  Will rewatch it on DVD many times.
B00003CY5J|4.0|I have to admit, I rarely buy/see a movie based on the cast. That may seem nuts, but I prefer certain story lines. However, when you put Norton and De Niro in the same film, how can you NOT want to see it?<br />These two play off each other beautifully. Whoever was in charge of casting is either brilliant or damn lucky. The whole polished professional vs. up and commer was executed to perfection by these two. Each seeming to size up the shortcomings of the other... move, counter move. All very cool.<br />Why do I give it 4 stars instead of 5? I guess I would have to point to the editing. I felt like the pacing was off during the middle of the movie. I found myself thinking &quot;Ok... moving right along&quot; about halfway through. If that does not indicate poor pacing (for me anyway), I don'tknow what does. If I had the option of giving this one 4.5 stars, I would have done so.
B00005T33W|1.0|Lots of folks seem to like this movie, however, we did not. Story is about a self-centered, self-absorbed teen age girl who never seems to be able to her connect actions with their consequences. There were a few funny lines (every one of which was in the preview) between long stretches of tedium. Save the cost of the rental and just watch the preview.
B00003CXI0|4.0|I'm very happy to have the film in my Harry Potter collection. I love the books almost as much as C.S. Lewis' &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &amp; the film is very true to the books. I hope this continues as the film series continues. <br />One disapointment is that I wish the deleted scenes had been added INTO the film as a &quot;Director's Cut&quot; instead of just tacked on to the end of the tape, it would have added to it's fidelity to the source material...of course, a Director's Cut will probably come, when Warner Bros need more cash! <br />Also, I wish the VHS would have ALL the deleted scenes, &amp; interviews. DVD isn't an option for everyone, so while those lucky enough get the fun and games, why not give the rest of us all the tape there is?
0140186395|5.0|Various people have described East of Eden as a novel about various things and with various themes. The resemblance to the biblical tale of Cain and Abel, enduring conflict between good and evil, and choice of will ... all are mentioned. The book's back cover contributes also: \\"mystery of identity; inexplicability of love; and the murderous consequences of love's absence.\\" Precisely what makes East of Eden such a great book is this proliferation of ideas and themes, which can quickly draw the reader into a profound and enlightened state of mind.<BR> However, this depth isn't the only reason for you to buy this book. Though this book could easily be the subject of a college thesis, at the same time it can be read merely for the joy of casual reading. The book includes numerous interesting and colorful characters. The reader meets Lee, the Chinese cook-philosopher whose role changes from that of servant to companion...Adam, Kate's wife (only legally) the sometimes painfully honest farmer around whose life much of the book evolves.<BR> However, even the best books can have minor flaws. For one who is less-than-interested in reading, this 602 page novel (minus the introduction, which is worth reading, but not before finishing the book) could turn into a reading marathon. Also, the book is written in a unique alternating format: one chapter will focus on the Trask family, and the next on the Hamiltons. In general, however, this book is a great work of literature and one that should definitely be read by everyone. ...
B000063S6Z|5.0|This cd is definitely worth the money.  Moby has compiled an awesome mix of everything.  I have yet to find a song of his that I don't like.  Moby's albums are the type that you can listen to for hours on end and never get bored with or wear out a song.  Some songs have an upbeat kind of feel, and others have more of a depressing note.  Good for relaxation or dance music...it's a bit of both.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves good music!!
B000068OCS|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi is a must see film. Pop it into your DVD player, turn up the volume, turn off the lights and prepare to be amazed. The only thing to be depressed about when you have finished watching the movie is that you hadn't seen it sooner. <br />While difficult to describe, much less spell, Koyaanisqatsi is a visual explosion of images coupled with a fantastic soundtrack thanks to Phillip Glass. <br />You will see references to this movie in everything from car commercials to the Simpsons (which has a direct reference to the movie). Therefore it is, in my humble opinion, a watershed movie. Watch this movie, then make your friends watch it.
B00003CXWV|5.0|I can't BELIEVE anyone could put down this movie!  First of all,it's a TRUE story about the famous criminal George Jung who quoted something like \\"I saw Johnny Depp become SO MUCH like me , it was scary\\"!  Johhny Depp did an EXCELLENT performance, he is an excellent actor, so is Ray Liotta (who plays his Dad, and Ray is only 7 and 1/2 yrs older than Johnny in real life,but this movie goes over a 25+ yr. time span)! It was refreshing to see Ray Liotta in a \\"Non-Violent role! lol! The first movie I saw with Penelope Cruz,and she was good.<BR>   I DO NOT see this movie as GLORIFYING crime!  Neither do my friends, we see the TRUTH in this, that CRIME DOESN'T PAY! George could have changed, but he was obsessed with living on the edge. This movie is a GREAT influence for those FOOLS out there who are selling drugs thinking \\"I'm careful, it will never happen to me\\". OR \\"I won't get cought, because I don't use drugs, I'm careful, I just sell them\\"(remember Ray Liotta in GOODFELLOWS getting busted for coke?  I recommend that movie also,good mafia movie,lots of famous stars & funny). This movie also teaches you, that when it comes to the people you THINK are your friends, who also sell drugs, are NOT really your friends! (no, I never sold them! you'll see in the movie what I mean). Everyone drug dealer is out to save their own self from jail! This movie is worth watching way more than once.  You'll see how George lost MORE than his freedom, mansion,wife, and fancy cars, in the end of the movie.  Theres good classic rock music in this movie too, plenty of action and suspence!!! Worth  Buying!
B000002KIE|5.0|A lot has been said about how great or how bad the Sex Pistols have been. I won't bother you with my own insignificant or even redundant rating (i give em' 5 by the way - hehe). Anyway, what I will tell you is, how to get the most out of this cd.  If you come at this cd with no idea what it is or what it's about, you might (most probably) will be reselling it back to the cd store you bought it from.  Especially if [you think] that Blink 182 is punk. LOL.  This cd is not self explanatory at all. You need some guidance to direct your... mind.  You have to know where this album comes from and what it's about to appreciate it. Otherwise, it may only be noise to you.  A great place to start is by renting the sex pistols movie The Filth and the Fury. If you are intrigued, and I guarantee you will be, I recommend that you also read Johnny Rottens auto-biography; Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs. It's a great book! You can even track down an old movie called The Great Rock and Roll Swindle which will teach you a lot. Once you've gotten a grasp of where they are coming from, you'll suddenly find yourself among that small minority of people in this world who understand what it's all about. Even then you may not like it, but at least you'll understand it...  You may even find the songs to be rich and dynamic explorations. You'll know that the song Bodies is about the wild eye'd... groupie girl...  Every song has a story behind it. Some more interesting than others. All reflect Johnny Rottens feelings of social class alienation, his insecurities and shyness and his blistering intelligence which shines through like no other. When the Sex Pistols broke up and then Sid Vicious died, the punk movement ended. They meant that much! They could not be replaced. Some say the songs have become relevant in a whole new way.  The album is a great inspiration to anyone who believes or wants to believe in themselves. People often return to it after long periods of time to hear a part of themselves they miss. It's a great inspiration to anyone who desires to think outside the box and still clings to a little altruism in a world numb with being complacent. [Get] this cd today!
B000065U1N|5.0|I just saw a phenomenal movie last night: Black Hawk Down. For those of you unfamiliar with the story behind the movie, it tells the story of an event that occurred during the 1992-93 United Nations/United States police action in Somalia to protect the innocent people of that country from the terror and famine wrought by tribal Warlord Mohammed Aidid. During one specific action on October 3rd, 1993, a squad of Delta Force and Army Rangers swooped in on a meeting of top Aidid aides held in the middle of hostile, Aidid-controlled territory. While the actual capture of Aidid's men went off with out a hitch, the escape was something far less than successful. Two of the Black Hawk helicopters that were used to transport the Rangers and Delta Force into the middle of the market place where the meeting was held were shot down by Aidid's militiamen. During the rescue attempt of the helicopter survivors, the Army's ground forces (inserted to provided the means to transport the prisoners from Aidid's territory to U.S. Base Camp) came under heavy fire as well. In the end, an operation that was to take no more than 30 minutes was not completed until well into the next day. 19 American soldiers lost their lives in this action and it was widely considered to be a huge fiasco by the general public and Clinton Administration (Clinton pulled U.S. Military forces out of Somalia 11 days later). <br />The movie \\"Black Hawk Down\\" takes a different approach the events of that day. While initially dealing with the political events and motivations behind actions in Somalia, this movie subsequently focuses on the actions and decisions of the soldiers who fought (and died) that day. Faced with a situation that had terribly wrong when nearly every Somali in that market place seemed to be a member of Aidid's forces and pinned the Americans down, the Army training and discipline came to the forefront. The stellar actions by these men kept the death toll at 'only' 19 when it could have ended upwith more than 100. The bravery of two men to preserve the lives of the crew of one of the downed helicopters at the expense of their own lives earned them posthumous Medals of Honor (Master Sergeant Gary Gordon and Sergeant First Class Randall Shughart).<br />The criticisms that this movie merely skimmed over the politics of these event the character development of the soldiers are hardly relevant. One must look at the intent and message the movie's director, Ridley Scott. The ferocious intensity of the fighting and the rapid-fire actions and decisions required of the soldiers are what Scott is trying trying to convey. He does so in a way that puts the viewer at the same ground-level view as the soldiers. The emotions and fears of the soldiers (some no more than 18-19 years old) trapped by the Somali attackers are felt by the audience. One empathizes with the plight and determination of the soldiers. <br />For me personally, watching a movie like this makes me even more committed to serving my country. Not because I enjoy fighting or have any desire to shoot or be shot at, but because of the determination and dedication these men demonstrate every moment of their lives doing their duty and serving their country in the finest manner possible.
B0000636UN|4.0|If you're deciding to buy this album...do it! Enough said. Some highlights of the album are Steve McQueen, Over You, Diamond Road, and Weather Channel. My favorite songs are Abilene and Lucky Kid!!<BR>It's worth owning, regardless of all the mixed reviews. If you've been listening to the radio for the past 14 weeks and still have &quot;Soak Up The Sun,&quot; in your head. Then that's reason enough to buy C'mon, C'mon!

0553381687|5.0|This is, quite simply, one of the best books I have ever read.  Although some parts of it can be a little graphic, it just adds to the flavor of the story.  The plots are intricately interlaced, and the reader is never sure what will happen next, or who the real bad guys are.<br />Each chapter takes you to the point of view of a different character in the story, and each character is wonderfully detailed, each with their own thoughts, feelings, and struggles.  Truly a great book.
B00005ATQF|4.0|Films that glamorize the experiences of war have long been a thing of the past.  \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is a fine component of the growing number of `anti-war' movies out there.  Set during the Vietnam War, there is nothing glamorous or even human about the battles these Marines must face (against both the enemy and within themselves).  The dehumanizing characteristic of these soldiers gets extra emphasis under the eye of Kubrick, who makes this a regular theme in his movies.  Easily the most powerful portion of this movie is the opening sequence of the Marines going through boot camp at Parris Island.  The portrayal of how these young men (high school grads, rich kids, farm boys...) get turned into inhuman killing machines is done with frightening realism. The dead-on performance of Marine Drill Sergeant Hartmann by R. Lee Ermey (a former Marine Drill Instructor in real life) enhances that effect.  Some men can handle the intensity; some cannot.  Private Lawrence (nicknamed `Gomer Pyle') can't hack it mentally or physically as a Marine and is constantly ridiculed by Hartmann and his fellow recruits.  The training and the treatment he receives unwittingly turns him into exactly what the Marines want (or think they do):  the inhuman, unthinking, killing machine;  so unthinking that he cracks and kills Hartmann when confronted during the last night on the island.  The dehumanizing environment follows the soldiers to their tours of duty in Vietnam, where being human can also mean being dead.  The soldiers learn that you cannot ever get to close to your friends because they may be the next to be sent home in a body bag courtesy of a surprise artillery attack or a hidden sniper.  <BR> \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is a character study of the world these men have to endure and survive.  This two-tiered story arc shows effective representations of this during the sequence in Vietnam.  While just standard movie far for war films, it still provides and accurate portrayal of that world.Where \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" truly shines is during the Boot Camp scenes.  Former Marines have watched those scenes and said that it was just like being back on the island.  The intensity and ferocity of the training make the viewer feel as though Sgt. Hartmann is drilling them as well.  The true standout performance is by Vincent D'Onofrio as a Private Pyle.  He easily conveys the transformation of Pyle from the `aw shucks', friendly farm boy to the crazed over the edge killing machine simply through the looks in his eyes.  The other characters, save for Hartmann, are typical war movie personalities from the wisecracking Private Joker (Modine) to the psychotic Animal Mother (Baldwin).  Each lends their own degree of believability to the role.

B00005RFAI|4.0|Its the truth, I never respected P!nk until M!ssundaztood, because all I saw her as was another teen idol, another talentless girl who would have her minutes, then quickly leave the spotlight, but I was wrong.  There are so many highlights to this album, that its hard to tell where to start.  The first song is \\"M!ssundaztood\\" which sounds kind of bland and boring when it begins, because there really isn't much to the song, but as the song goes on, it gets bigger and better, it also has a quite funny ending to it, give it a listen.  The album starts to take shape on track 2 \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" which pretty much sets the mood for the album, and it really all in all says it all, but don't stop there, it gets better.  \\"Just Like A Pill\\", the third single from this cd took a while to grow on me, I really didn't care much for it until it hit radio, but now I can't get enough of it.  \\"Get this Party Started\\" honestly is not one of the greatest songs on the album, but it was a good idea for a first single, it was a quite explosive way to announce that you're back in the spotlight.  The other highlights of the album are \\"Family Portrait\\", \\"Dear Diary\\", \\"Eventually\\", \\"Lonely Girl\\", and \\"My Vietnam\\", however every good album has to have some kind of flaw right?  Well its flaws I believe are \\"Misery\\" featuring Steven Tyler, and \\"Gone To California\\", but altogether its a really good album.  Also be sure to check out the bonus track \\"Catch 22\\", I've heard better, but I must say, its a pretty unique song, its very different from the rest of the album.  Well thats it, enjoy!
B00005QIPH|5.0|OK, I've gotten into too many 2:00 in the morning bar arguments over the Strokes not to interject something:  The same people who complain that the Strokes are simply ripping off the Velvet Underground are generally the same people who think themselves all cool and indie because they dig Yo La Tengo.  The thing is, Yo La rips off the VU as well, they just prefer &quot;Venus In Furs&quot; to &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;.  If you're going to call a rock band derivative that's fine, but it can't be considered a fault if they do it well.  And the Strokes do what they do very well.  I for one am ecstatic that a VU/Stooges/Television influenced band is on TRL, because I think it would be tragic if the youth of America grew up thinking that the width and breadth of rock consisted of bands like Hoobastank and Abandoned Pools.  The horror... the horror...<br />In closing, just buy the damn album.  It's very good music.
630018403X|5.0|The Breakfast Club is probably the archetypal movie of the 1980s, at least that of the youth in America.  It is an indelible part of cultural history and remains as fresh and brash as ever today.  While teenagers can certainly not be broken down into five distinct types, the five students forced to spend their Saturday at school in detention do a pretty good job of covering the basics.  You have Claire, the popular prom queen type, played by the wonderful Molly Ringwald, the jock (Emilio Estevez), the brain (Anthony Michael Hall), the weirdo (Alley Sheedy), and the disrespectful criminal (Judd Nelson)--five students who are complete strangers to each other and totally different personalities.  Terrorizing and threatening them is an older teacher intent on enforcing discipline among them.  The criminal is determined to foment an insurrection, and eventually the strict supervision of the students breaks down.  At first, the students yell at and fight with one another and are especially antagonistic toward the juvenile delinquent among them.  As the day progresses, the students begin to tell their own stories--who they are, why they are in detention, etc.  Their conversations weave back and forth between insults and incriminations and words of sympathy and concern.  They eventually start roaming the school halls, leading to the classic scenes of them skidding across the halls in a mad flight to return to the library before the teacher returns to check on them.  Somehow, the five eventually do open up to each other, confessing secrets, forming friendships, and realizing that the problems they considered their own are shared to some degree with each other.<br />This is a great movie and one that appealed directly to young people--everyone can understand problems with overbearing or neglectful parents, grades, peer pressure, drugs, etc.  I must say that I sometimes felt the changes between hateful exchanges and sympathetic dialogue came a little abruptly, though; I for one never saw any redeeming quality in Judd Nelson's character.  I also couldn't believe some of the destruction that was done to school property over the course of the day.  Anthony Michael Hall was brilliant in his role and provided some very funny moments, but I as a former brain did not see much of myself in him.  The real point of the film, though, is that teenagers all have problems they must deal with, that the folks not in your little group or clique are just as human as you are and worthy of respect, and that adults seemingly just cannot understand their kids for the most part, and that very fact only heightens the need for teenagers to depend on one another.<br />I should also mention the music.  \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\" by Simple Minds was perhaps the most-played song of the entire decade, and it is rightly associated forever with this movie.  Also, whenever you hear the famous whistling tune from this movie (and we've all heard it countless times since 1985, a fact which by itself demonstrates the much-deserved popularity of this movie over the years), you will not forget about The Breakfast Club.one never saw any redeeming quality in Judd Nelson's character.

B00005YXZH|1.0|Pay no attention to the average 4 star rating of this CD. It's terrible. It's overproduced tripe. There is no &quot;Trace&quot; of the band that gave us A.M. left on this album. It sounds like a half-hearted Beck tribute band. &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot;? It's almost unlistenable, no check that. It IS unlistenable, just like the rest of this inexplicably well-reviewed mish-mash. At least listen to the samples provided above before wasting your money.
B0000636UN|5.0|A bit of a departure from her previous efforts, and by far her least celebratory album, \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is chock full of earnest confessionals and sing-at-the-top-of-your-lungs melodies that are more abundant here than any of her other CDs. A perfect album for the summer or for any day that could use some cheering up, \\"C'mon C'mon\\" starts out perfectly with the top-down-wind-in-your-hair coolness of \\"Steve McQueen,\\" which rolls smoothly into the inferior but insanely catchy \\"Soak Up the Sun.\\" While there are several more sunny sing-a-longs, \\"You're An Original\\" and \\"Abilene\\" among them, it's the more plaintive ballads that are worth the 14 bucks you'll shell out alone. \\"Over You\\" is an incredibly emotional ballad that tugs at your heartstrings and makes you really feel for Crow, who, at 40, has yet to find a soul mate and is constantly searching for relevance in a music market filled with teen queens. And \\"It's Only Love,\\" which is also performed by Stevie Nicks on her excellent 2001 (and Crow-produced) \\"Trouble In Shangri-La\\" album, is revved up for this album and draws more attention to the song's beautiful lyrics, among them, \\"I think I met my match again/Standing round the candlelight/In the middle of this blizzard/You came/And melted all the ice.\\" \\"C'mon C'mon\\" may not have an obvious \\"All I Wanna Do\\" or \\"If It Makes You Happy,\\" but will as a whole certainly find a home in longtime fans' hearts (like mine) as her best work yet.
B000050XEI|5.0|This CD is full of soothing music that is good for any time of the day.  I use this while I dance.
B000002JOH|4.0|Pantera's thrashing metal riffs and screaming vocals are absolutely amazing.  When I listen to their songs I hear obvious Metallica, and Black Sabbath influence.  If you are even remotely into metal I would buy this album.  It just cranks!!!  <BR>There are a lot of people that don't give metal the credit it needs, and deserves.  I am not bashing the pop scene at all, because if something is good I will give it props.  I just don't agree with the overplaying of songs on radio, MTV, and such.  I just think more people need to expand their horizons and listen different kinds of music rather than listening to whatever is on the radio.  I mean, if you are having a bad day and are mad at the world, you don't wanna pop in \\"I want it that Way\\", you wanna hear some rippin metal!  So all you pop princesses, and little boys out there, buy this album and you won't be dissapointed!
6304493681|2.0|this anime was definatly overrated. The plot itself wasnt bad at all, but it had no depth, no detail. the movie was pretty much fuzzy the whole time.It doesnt make any sense whats on whatevers going on and the ending pretty much blowed. go see ninja scroll, vampire hunter d, and princess mononoke. those are real classic anime. =)
B000060MY6|5.0|I've watched this movie at least 25 times over, and I still reject the dream interpretation embraced by so many stupid people.  Those who, like the critic Curmudgeonson, do not truly understand the film (as I do) may say something like, \\"No scene shows us a moment outside of a dream\\". This is totally wrong. As anyone with half a brain should see, what we actually have in the film is a mixture of reality, pseudo-reality, psycho-pseudo-reality, fantasy, micro-fantasy, chronic fantasy, anti-quasi-fantasy, semi-quasi-fantasy, pseudo-fantasy, pseudo-semi-fantasy, quasi-pseudo dream, macro-dream, retro-semi-dream, ante-retro-dream, and plain semi-dream.<br />The movie's central figure is obviously Diane.  Diane Selwin fails as an actress and carries on an emotionlly-exhausting lesbian love affair with Camilla Rhodes.  Diane eventually becomes revengeful and paranoid.  She thinks Camilla's success in the film industry was a result of the aid of powerful men.  Hence, the scene in the office is clearly an example of pseudo-fantasy blended with quasi-pseudo-dream.  Similarly, the scene with the director and Mr. \\"Espresso\\", among others,  demonstrates the characteristics of macro-dream.<br />Simply put, it is VERY EVIDENT that Betty is nothing more than the pathetic Diane's idealized self, which is an example of fantasy.  But Betty is not just a manifestation of fantasy, as so many moronic people claim.  Betty is also an example of anti-quasi-fantasy, and Diane necessarily calls on her every single miserable little day.  Betty changes over times, both in reality and in the mind of Diane.  Betty is the person Diane wants to be but is not.  Let's face it: we all dream of this kind of imaginery self.<br />Other parts of the movie are similar but also different, as well.  For instance, the \\"man\\" behind the diner is clearly related to Diane in the biological sense, though not in any discernible way.  The fact of the matter is:  A man saw Diane pass a photo to someone, and then givehim the cash in the purse.  This man wonders if a \\"hit\\" is being orchestrated, but he, as anyone can tell, does not know for sure.  Thus, he begins having a retro-semi-dream involving a beast, which may represent his unconscious, unresolved guilt from childhood experiences with his mother.<br />The cowboy, who may be both important and unimportant, is a bit of an enigma to me.  Also, why do Rita and Betty have red highlights at the end of the movie?  Why does the director have a lighter hair tone?  Is Diane's suicide part of an ante-retro-dream?  There are some things that even I can't explain, but they are few and far between. For the most part, if you are anywhere close to intelligent, the answers to the questions that the movie raises are very easily answered through a bit of close study.  I think I know exactly what Lynch was trying to express. It's just sad that, like Curmudgeonson, most people don't.
0142000655|4.0|We make many choices in our everyday lives.  We decide what clothes to wear, what food to eat, and what we want to do with our lives, but how many of us decide whether we want to take the evil path or the \\"good\\" path?  Steinbeck addresses this important choice in East of Eden.  <BR>Overall I feel that this is an excellent book because of its well rounded characters and its enduring theme of good vs. evil.  Each character has his/her own story and Steinbeck intertwines these stories in clever fashion as the relationships between Adam and Charles as well as Caleb and Aaron resemble the relationship between Cain and Able in the Bible.  East of Eden is definitely worth your time if you are looking for a good book to read.
0688152023|4.0|I found the stretches and exercises in this book beneficial, and could really feel my muscles working.  I enjoyed the floor barre section, and I feel that if I had enough time to do the exercises more regularly I would really see the benefits.  I am a teenage dancer, at an intermediate level, but I feel that the exercises would be beneficial for both non dancers and dancers at all levels.  Some of the exercises could be difficult if the individual is not flexible at all, and some of the center exercises could be rather simple for intermediate to advanced level dancers.  All in all I enjoyed the workout and the book (especially the lovely photographs and information about dancers in the New York City Ballet).
B00004Z459|5.0|I saw the video for \\"One Step Closer\\" back when it was first released.  I thought it was an ok song, so i downloaded the first three tracks off the album.  After listening to those three tracks, the next day I went and bought this album.<br />Linkin Park may be considered pop-rock or some genre with the word \\"pop\\" added in front of it, but that doesn't matter.  IT IS DAMN GOOD MUSIC!!!  People whine about pop-rock and pop-rap being childish or inferior to the real rock and rap.  If it's good music, I really don't care what the critics and 14 year old middle-american teens call it, I am going to listen to it.  <br />With that being said, Linkin Park is not comparable with any of the bands out there today.  They aren't as heavy as the likes of Korn or System of A Down; they aren't as in touch with nature as Incubus and P.O.D are; and they don't have as much hip hop in them as Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock do.  Linkin Park takes all the best aspects of each of these styles and combines them to produce an awesome sounding album.<br />\\"Crawling\\" is the song that really lured me in.  Chester does the chorus with so much power and force that you cannot help but be blown away by his voice coming out of your speakers.  \\"In the End\\" is the song that everyone fell in love with.  Every radio station from the hard rock station to the TOP 40 station played this song.  That is why Linkin Park is so phenomenal.  They can make music that captures the listeners of all genres.<br />In the end (no pun intended), \\"Hybrid Theory\\" will continue to dominate the Billboard 200 in months to come.  Hell, in the past two years since their album was released, it has sold over 6 million copies and has stayed on the Billboard top 100 since it first debuted.  Linkin Park has become one of the most popular bands with the help of this incredible cd.

B0000584V3|5.0|After reading numerous reviews for this citing its excellence, I decded to give Opeth a shot. Three weeks and fourteen listens later, I am finding Blackwater Park very difficult to pull out of my CD player. There are very few words that can describe it. This is extremely good metal, so good that my friend who only listens to jazz and hates all metal except for Slipknot absolutely loves it. \\"Bleak\\" and \\"The Drapery Falls\\" are the best songs, but every song has some great qualities to it.  You've got the melodic/death transitions of Nothingface, the mysticism of A Perfect Circle, and the sexy gothic epics of Type O Negative wrapped up in one band that dethrones them all in every way. Please do yourself a favor and purchase this in the near future!

B00006690F|4.0|THis is his best album by far.  You can tell he matured as a man.  No more plotting how to rape his wife or kill his mother and wife.  Instead, this comes out as a great rap album.  IT's not the best, just a little bit short.<br />The single \\"Without Me\\" is very good, which you can dance to.  In, \\"Halie's Song,\\"  Eminem actually sings in a nice falsetto.  \\"Drips\\" is a sex romp with D12's Obie Trice.<br />This CD shows a matured man, not necessarily a matured rapper.  Even though he has cut down on the killing, he still talks about homophobia and such.  If you like rap, this is for you.  If you dont like rap, it is still for you.

If this is the best that experimental music can make today.. rock is dead.. <BR>no interesting ideas, banal melodies contamined with electronic sound... awful texts....<BR>nothing new.. all musicl ideas are taken by classical kraut records of the seventies...
B00003CXMG|5.0|Almost Famous is beautifully entertaining and easily sinks into your heart. It's about a young boy, William Miller, who's healthy relationship with his mother is what's keeping him away from the experience of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll. After his older sister leaves him with her collection of familiar 1970s records and a note explaining that one song by The Who can make him see his future, he grows up and dives into the rock culture of what the world once became. Sooner or later, Lester Bangs, a famous critic for rock music, becomes a mentor and leads William to his dream of living the ultimate behind the scenes life as a flourishing young journalist. Just as William enters the world and finds the true meaning of being on tour, he finds himself overwhelmed hanging out with a fictional hard rock band Stillwater. He also finds himself gorgeously infatuated with the openminded dreamer Penny Lane, a young band aid, which is a false name she takes on, and would never tell a soul.<BR> As soon as the hardship of the almost famous band and later confessions of secrets uncover, they sit quiet, put things behind them, and grow closer together. They also sing along together to Elton John's Tiny Dancer (a memorable scene). While the tour continues, and William's mother's concerned phone calls continue, William loses his virginity but gains the meaning of what it means to understand and appreciate life in general, and that you can't take the good without taking the bad.<BR> This movie is a classic instant winner, with a cast that shines, and music that catches you. It's so touching and happy, you'll fall in love with it endlessly.
B000000OEI|5.0|Hans Zimmer's best work.  The theme has been used in several commericals dealing with military.  This is among the best soundtack/original score i have ever heard.  I've even recreated and redesigned a CD cover case for this album.  These tracks would sound excellent on a space battle or science fiction action theme.
B0000508U6|5.0|I am a 40-something family guy with way too much stuff to do and not a lot of time to read CD jackets, so I'm not going to cite song names or the names of the musicians on this album.  But I believe in giving credit and praise wherever it is due.  So I'm just going to say that I found this album stunningly, hauntingly beautiful.  <br />I don't listen to a lot of new music.  My CD library would classify me as a rock-n-roll dinosaur.  And so, when a 7th grade family friend handed this to me and said it was worth a listen, I promtly left it on the shelf for several months.  Finally, I put it on.  And put it on and put it on.  It's just fine music.
B000062Y98|5.0|Most of the reviews below are very accurate and balanced ( so the 5 star ratings are NOT exaggerated , even a 20 scale would not be justifying for this ) - so instead<BR>for describing the album I can state that ( in spite of a overgrowing metal genre<BR>in general ) &quot; A night at the Opera &quot; is a rare chance to hear the absolute best in<BR>metal. The disc contains more songwriting talent , melodic inspiration and flawless musical performance than a listener can normally absorb.....( in this sence , negative or postive , You could call it overproduced ). Normally I don't favourite B.G because of their long songs<BR>and lack of short , punchy leadloops ( a la Helloween, Hammerfall, Gravedigger ) - but<BR>I must admit that this is one the most awesome CD:s I've heard. The songs are extremely<BR>and intensively compact,wellwritten and melodic - completely filled with mighty choir passages,<BR>keys and beautiful soundscapes behind every temposhift. Albeit it's length , it's virtually impossible to find ONE song or even a second that feels superfluous or like a &quot;timefiller &quot;<BR>( unlike the modern Helloween albums f.i. ). No wonder they needed two years to record this<BR>piece of marvels , the only painful question is how B.G will handle the expectations after this<BR>album ( a complete style change or maybe a retour to their &quot;old&quot;  &quot; Tales from a Twilight World&quot;-style ?  ) . <BR>I usually avoid superlatives , but this album really makes You feel small and stunned  - so beautiful and incredible unique.<BR>It will make You reflect for a while on the tragic and mindless conformity and &quot; fastfood-thinking&quot; in music media today. For testlisteners ; it's no point in saying which song is more fantastic than the other , but it's true that &quot; And then there was Silence &quot; is a awesome epos that will take You by storm. For us old Helloween-fans , I would suggest a testlisten to the supermelodic and  uptempoish &quot; Soulforged &quot;. The only sad thing is the consequence that<BR>this album will make the world around You smaller and other artist appear less worthy Your attention. It pushes the underlying ( inevitable ) question ; will there be another musical item that can shake You like this one could ? Regardless ; for those of You who don't know AATO = Enjoy and allow Yourself to discover this sensation , it's one of the few CD:s that You really need to own.
B0000026VZ|4.0|I like Toto because I am used to hearing them on local radio.  Going out to buy a Greatest Hits album concerned me because I didn't know if I was going to like what I didn't know.  The songs we all know &quot;Africa, Hold the Line, I'll Be Over You, Rosanna, I Won't Hold You Back,&quot; as always were great to listen to.  Other songs such as &quot;99, Pamela, Georgy Porgy&quot; were also great.  The songs with Jean Michel Bryon I skip over, they are overboard pop, except for &quot;Can You Hear What I'm Saying&quot; which I can get through without gagging.  Anyways for all it's flaws this CD is outnumbered with plusses.
B000000W5L|4.0|This album would have easily been rated the Stones' best by ALL of the fan, critics, etc., if the production and mix of the album was up to par. It's really a crying shame that much of the beauty of this album was lost in a muddy haze. If you just take the time to read the lyrics or listen to the musical interplay between Keith Richards and drummer Charlie Watts, you realize what a diamond in the rough this recording really is.  I guess that the world will never really know. Too bad for them. Maybe they could use the technology that's available today and clean this thing up and release an alternate version. Then it would Rule! :)
B00006690F|4.0|This album wasnt really what I had expected from Eminem bein a fan since way back. But it shows that he has matured over the years. His music is more serious now, the beats are darker, and its more musical. Lyrically, I thought this was a really good album, it wasnt as outspoken as I thought it was goin to be, but Eminem still has unique ideas. Honestly I think the music should have been more up-tempo. Maybe he soulda tried out some new producers like the Neptunes. But if you like the crazy Eminem rapping dirty about everything dirty there is to rap about, u probably wont like this.
B000000W5L|4.0|I love this album. Having said that, the only reason that it doesn't deserve 5 stars in due to the quality of the recordings, which in light of what all was going on at the time that this album was made is not surprising, but also unforgiveable. This record reeks of self-indulgence, drugs, tension, and world weariness (the Stones were definitely in exile).  If you do your research about the life and times of the Stones during this period everything about this album makes more sense. Mick and Keith were inevitably moving farther apart in their personal and professional lives; Jagger chose the jet-set crowd and Richards the junkies and hangers on that lived in his villa during this time period. Part of the problem was that for the first time since Mick and Keith became song writing partners they were unable to sit down for extended periods of time and put their heads together to polish the songs and have the rest of the group put the finishing touches on the music. This album is more of a collaboration by committee. The only thing that keeps the whole thing from sinking is the guitar genius of Keith Richards and the lyrical mastery of Mick Jagger. No other group could have survived in this atmosphere at the time (remember, the Beatles had been long gone by 1972).  Given the \\"usual\\" environment that served the Stones so well during the Beggars' Banquet to Sticky Fingers period would have produced an astonishing musical accomplishment; as it stands then and now, this is a near masterpiece when taken as a whole; the greatness is in the sum of the parts. <BR>     I would love to see a re-mixed version of Exile on Main Street be released, not as a replacement for the original, but as perhaps \\"Exile on Main St., the alternate\\", etc. I think that this would settle much of the arguments about the merits of this release, and give us the best of both worlds. Perhaps then the true power of this recording could be realized.

B00005YU1O|5.0|If I would have died, this film wouldn't exist for me. How could one want to die? After seeing this, you'll never. Or no, that's wrong. \\"Waking Life\\" marvels at death-life connection, the most important thing, that we can know about only as far as we can know knowledge itself. For death may be the most important part of life. But maybe not. God is dreaming this world, all of us, everything, just once. And does she suspect she's dreaming? Does she believe in us? She gets to see us fly in our dreams. She gets to make our faces and places. You will go so far into this movie that you'll never get outta it. And that's the way life should be. Nothing is ever gone. It's all, all of history, here now, in attenuated, if abstract, form. The potential to reverse time. Why not? How can we say the world is causally closed? That there can't be the metaphysical soul, because our brains are physical, and we know all about it, we can theoretically perfectly explain-something that isn't a thing can't make me write these words. And so. We're artificial intelligences. What is natural? The natural is the mental universe-mentality with rules. Why would particles attract each other? They have nothing better to do. They are part of god. Who could be dead, but again, who would die when the best part's just beginning? True pleasure is not to be avoided. Anyone with a real choice wouldn't choose pain. Because truth is true. In a way nothing is false. Imagine the birth of god-floating in a void. Not so scary, if you try it yourself. What was the neuronal configuration of god's birth-mind? A hundred billion neurons in my brain, four billion years of \\"evolution\\"-twenty-five new ones per year, wired in in the sublime insanity of mind, consciousness which is the most amazing thing, possible. So I say. Given my somewhat limited knowledge. There are people who know everything. Or who know people who know everything. Linklater's film is about waking up. Wake up and scream, metaphorically, or really.Only you can know if you're real. Only you can tell us what you'd tell us. Nothing is ever the same as anything else. All electrons aren't just one. There are multitudes. And we invite each other. Or we automatically fear each other. I don't think people are too lazy to live. I think it can be too hard. Unless. You know the trick. The first move you learn, after which you're addicted. It's your life that's been treating you so and so, and so take me any way, how long is a day, we learn to pay, for which we can play. say the secret words that god would say.

0446607274|4.0|This is the third Michael Connelly novel, and the second featuring Harry Bosch, that I've read, and I continue to be impressed by this author's skill.  In fact, I think I'm getting addicted to it, having read three of his books in a week's time.<br />I've ridden Angel's Flight and am familiar with the basic L. A. area, so Connelly's descriptions definitely hit home.  It's always enjoyable to be able to picture the areas mentioned through having been there.  <br />I'm becoming increasingly impressed with Connelly's description and perspective of investigations.  The policemen in his books are not simple good and bad stereotypes.  They are living breathing individuals, and the author is imminently fair in his portrayals.  After reading a Bosch novel, it's easier to consider the different views of right and of wrong.  Connelly makes it easier to have an insight into all the factors of police investigations and of the behaviours of the law enforcers.  We can more easily see that it's not always that easy to determine what's right and what's wrong.  In this particular novel, you find yourself admiring some aspects of the victim while seeing other aspects that are less admirable.  And this is important to my own enjoyment of the story.  Not to say that there aren't some characters that appear to have no redemptive qualities at all.  But he is fair with most of the characters so that you can understand why they make some of the decisions and perform some of the actions they do.<br />And of course, there is the constantly twisting and turning plot that's been in every Connelly book I've read yet.  He hasn't yet failed to mislead me through part of a book...in fact, I went rather far afield in this one, certain that I saw through some of his misdirection.  However, after being misled, I find that he has been playing fair.  <br />If you're looking for crime fiction that will make you think, that will challenge your deductive abilities and will also cause you to speculate on the ethical implications, you should enjoy this book.
1558908498|5.0|Scream 2 begins at a movie theatre, were a movie called 'Stab\\" (based on the book \\"The Woodsboro Murders\\" which in turn was based on the killings in the first \\"Scream\\" film and was written by Gale Weathers) is playing.  Two college students (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett/Jada Pinkett Smith from The Nutty Proffesor) are murdered by yet another killer clad in black and wearing a \\"Father Death\\" mask.  The next day, Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is horrified to hear this on the news and runs to her new boyfriend, Derek (Jerry O'Connell) and her old friend from the first film, Randy (Jamie Kennedy) for protection, but no matter, she is soon attacked by the killer and Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox/Courteney Cox Arquette from Friends) is on the case like a lightning bolt.  This annoys Sydney, but she has bigger things to worry about.  The body-count is beginning to rise, and anyone is a suspect!  Is it Derek (\\"Hello, Billy Loomis!\\").  Is it wounded deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette),who seems to immediatlly show up right at the time of them murders?  Is it Randy, who may have seen one to many movies and gotten brainwashed?  Is it Gale, the annoying reporter who always in on the case?  Is it Mickey (Timothy Olyphant), another movie freak? Is it Cici Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who defends the right to have violence in movies?  Or, is it another reporter, Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf from Rosseanne)?  Now, this mystery is going to be murder to solve!  <br />Scream 2 is an excellent thriller and wonderful sequel to a smash hit phenomenon, Scream (1996) which was also a great movie.  Scream 2's great becuase it, like 1994's Wes Craven's New Nightmare, has the courage to talk about things most horror movies would avoid.  Scream 2 asks the question \\"Do violent movies cause our violent actions?\\"  Wow, that's a good question. Scream 2 asks the question, and leaves it up to us to answer the question.  That's the courage of this film.  It's got guts.  <br />Of course, people not looking for a real point and who just want slasher entertinment will adore this movie.  Is it gory?  Yes, quite.  Lots of blood and goo (and brains).  Some of the deaths include, stabbings in the head, guttings, regular old stabbings, a fall from a second story building, slit throat, and a pole through the head.  Lots of blood and gore which is impressivly done.  Also, the acting is swell.  All the actors returning from the first are excellent, and the new cast is good, too.  The writing from this movie is good, and once again, Wes Craven makes the film look very good.  All the actors are on key, thnks to him, and he still has that style from the first.  <br />Th  Scream 2 is available in two DVD releases.  If you get the film separately (and not in The Ultimat Scream Collection box set) you get a pretty mediocre DVD.  The picture is OK, though non-anamorphic and stretched out on widescreen TVs.  The sound is a great 5.1 surround in which dialouge is clear and the music and sound effects are booming in action scenes.  But where this disk really lacks is the extras.  All you have is one trailer for Scream 2 and a few recommendations.  Big dissipointment.  <br />However, if you get the truly awesome DVD box set you've got an exclusive Dimension Collector's Edition of the movie.  It's really great.  First off, the widescreen format is anamorphically enhanced for widescreen TVs (which is nice) and the sound is the same booming 5.1 Surround and it's just as good as the other disk.  Then.... we get to the extras!  First is a nice and informative commentary by Wes Craven, producer Marriane Maddelini, as well as the director of photography.  Writer Kevin Williamson is no where to be heard on this track.  This is a shame, because he brought a great wit to the track on the first Scream, but this commentary is still very good.  Lots of interesting information to be found here!  Also, we have a nice documentary on the making of the movie, some production notes, a few music videos, and lots of trailers and TV spots.  A very nice supply of extras.  <br />Scream 2 is a great movie, and getting the box set is worth it for the Collector's Edition.  <br />If you found my review helpful, please vote for me!  Thank you!
078322818X|4.0|Believe me, it was fun being a teenager in the late '50's and early 60's, and this movie captures that relatively innocent fun.  Sure, the older generation complained about the &quot;wildness&quot; of the teenagers, but that has been true back to ancient times.  But for the average teenager, life just was not really that serious.  The sound of the music, the activities, the joy of cruising, all were part of teenage life.  <br />Lucas did a terrific job of capturing the mood and spirit of the times.  He had a great cast of young actors to work with, great oldies for the musical background, and the movie shows that considerable work was done to bring it all together.  This is one truly enjoyable movie.  <br />However, most of these reviews seem to miss one important point and that is the rather jolting return to everyday reality provided by the ending in which we're told what happened to each of these happy teenagers.  And that ending helps give this extremely entertaining movie a little more meaning.  <br />Personally, I just can't put this movie into the realm of &quot;greatest all time movies&quot;.  It misses that plateau, but it still is prime movie making and well worth seeing.

B00003CXXJ|3.0|Maybe it was marketed that way, but there isn't anything for kids to  understand here. Well...perhaps you could show it to the 9-13 crowd and they'd get it, because all the jokes are sublimely blue. And that dragon would scare the bejesus out of a youngin. As an adult, it was mild entertainment, plenty of fairy tale parody and some pop culture references, cuteness, a few absurdities. It wasn't as good as I heard it would be, but I liked it overall. Is there a good plot? Is there a good message? Oh, shut up and see it.
0609610570|5.0|This may well prove to be one of the most influential business books published in recent years. In it, Bossidy and Charan (with Charles Burck) focus on what effective execution involves. Having read or observed interviews of Bossidy, I realized while reading this book that his is the primary role in the collaboration. Mercifully, the reader is spared vague theories as well as buzzing words and overheated phrases. Anchored in a wealth of real-world business experience, the book's core insights could be of substantial value to literally anyone who currently has problems \\"getting things done\\", doing them well, and on-time.<br />In the first chapter, the authors identify what they call \\"the gap nobody knows.\\" That is somewhat hyperbolic. Obviously Bossidy and Charan are aware of it as are, presumably, countless other decision-makers in various companies which sustain profitability while attracting and then retaining \\"the best and the brightest\\" people, often from competitor companies. In any event, the authors correctly stress the importance of eliminating the gap between recognizing what must be done and getting it done. The authors focus on three former CEOs of major corporations, each of whom they hold in high regard: Richard A. McGinn (Lucent Technologies) G. Richard Thoman (Xerox), and C. Michael Armstrong (AT&amp;T). However, McGinn was \\"clearly out of touch\\" with day-to-day operations during his last year as CEO. For whatever reasons, Thoman lacked two essential \\"building blocks\\": the right people in key positions on his management team, and, appropriate core processes by which to implement his strategy, one which the authors view as being sound. As for Armstrong, the ambitious growth strategy he pursued was \\"disconnected from both external and internal realities\\" such as the regulatory climate at that time and the AT&amp;T culture which was resistant to the major changes which Armstrong's strategy required.  These three examples illustrate that even those with exceptional intelligence, energy, and character can fail to achieve their worthy objectives. The authors acknowledge that  \\"Shaping the broad picture into a set of executable actions is analytical, and it's a huge intellectual, and emotional challenge.\\" Some organizations and their leaders succeed. This book explains how. Most organizations and their leaders do not. This book explains why.<br />Some readers of this review may incorrectly infer from my comments thus far that this book was written primarily for and about senior-level corporate executives. For that reason, I reiterate that all of the observations, evaluations, and suggestions provided in this book are directly relevant to almost anyone in any organization (regardless of size or nature) who is expected to \\"get things done,\\" whatever those \\"things\\" may be. I agree completely with Noel Tichy (author of The Leadership Engine) that every organization needs aggressive and productive initiative at all levels.<br />Including the word \\"discipline\\" in this book's title was intentional and is appropriate. Obviously, those who are decisive are not always successful. (What I call the \\"Fire! Ready! Aim! Syndrome\\" is far too common, especially among less-experienced but eager and ambitious executives.) The most effective decision-making process is one based on sufficient and relevant information which has been rigorously analyzed. (Thus evaluated, information becomes intelligence.) Relevant and (especially) painful realities are taken into full account. All appropriate options are identified and prioritized. When a major crisis occurs which requires an immediate response, the decision-maker(s) involved must also have courage. Discipline is essential throughout this entire process, a discipline which includes what Daniel Goleman characterizes as \\"emotional intelligence\\" or what Ernest Hemingway characterizes as \\"grace under duress.\\"<br />As indicated previously, I think this book will be of great value to any decision-maker  (regardless of title or status) in any organization (regardless of size or nature) because the authors focus relentlessly on HOW some decision-makers get results and WHY most others don't. I recommend this book to individual executives, of course, but also to those involved in management training programs which involve others. (It would be terrific for developing \\"fast trackers.\\"). Also, if and when appropriate, this book in combination with Michael Hammer's The Agenda would be an excellent \\"homework assignment\\" to be completed prior to an executive retreat or (as some prefer) advance. Moreover, I think anyone in the management consulting business should also read it. If ever there was a time when clients expect those such as I to help them \\"get things done,\\" is it now.<br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Hammer's book as well as David Maister's Practice What You Preach, Jim O'Toole's Leading Change and The Executive's Compass, and Kaplan and Norton's The Strategy-Focused Organization.n-maker  (regardless of title or status) in any organization (regardless of size or nature) because the authors focus relentlessly on HOW some decision-makers get results and WHY most others don't.

0738206679|5.0|I recommend this book to all, scientists and general public as well. Think of it as an overview of all the advances in the field written in an easy to understand and entertaining way.<br />The aspects that I disagree with is that sometimes the author tries a little too hard to make it look like every network is just about the nodes and edges between them disregarding the functionality that a node might have. The ideas presented in the book treat networks from a statistical physicists point of view. The results/conclusions are only applicable for systems made up by a very large number of nodes and edges.<br />Regardless of the criticism above the author does an excellent job in presenting his ideas and the book is littered with interesting examples and &quot;insider&quot; information.
B00003CXI1|1.0|I looked forward to this DVD being released ever since the movie was released in theaters because I could not wait to see the deleted scenes.  When I first got the DVD and tried to find them, lo and behold I couldn't.  Ater fooling around for more than 2 hours on the second disc, I had to cheat and go to the Harry Potter website to find the key.  How disappointing!  I am an adult who is a huge fan of the books, and I loved the movie. However, having to go through that rigamorole, made me furious and frustrated, and it was just for 7 scenes, come on!  I hope Warner Bros does a more satisfactory job with the next movie and keeps in mind that most adults do not have the patience for this kind of nonsense.  They need to remember that adults are the ones who normally DO the buying.
B000001GPX|5.0|Klieber's 7th is one of the boilerplate versions that everyone who loves the 7th and has multiple versions must have.<br />Also, check out some of his 'radio broadcasts' of this work.<br />While they don't have great sound quality, they have the energy and momentum.
B00005JKYS|5.0|The acting of Mel Gibson is superb, and superb is the epic recreated by We Were Soldiers.  It is so intense that for the first time since Saving Private Ryan, I left the room overwhelmed by the silence of the rest of the audience.  We all left the theater with our eyes bathed in tears.<br />This is an American war film.  A few times the American flag waves on the screen, and yet We Were Soldiers becomes not a jingoistic solliloquium of how well a few Marines performed on the battle field.  This American field shows the tragedy of war from both sides, the American and the Vietnamese.  The Vietnamese general, for example, ends up regreting that the Americans have gotten engaged in a battle and suffered so many casualties; he foresees at that point that that war had become American, and that many thousands would have to die before America would finally pull her troops out of Vietnam.<br />This is a very fine movie depicting the stupidity of war, of dying for one's country.  Every time an American dies, or a Vietnamese, or an Afghan, an universe of beauty dies.  There is no logic behind it, there is no point to it.  A country, if great, would never trade a life for economic might.  Please go see this movie; let us stop waving flags and believing that we are better than our neighbours.
B000002KK2|5.0|On Saturday Afternoons In 1963 is one of my favorite songs.  It's got such a wonderful achingly slow melody.  There's not a bad song on this album and it plays well as a whole cohesive album (how many of today's offerings play well as a whole???).  One of the all time great debuts.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Thriller is absolutely a trmendously creative album in MJs catalog. No wonder it became the biggest selling album of all time selling 47 million copies worldwide!<br />Noone will ever forget the incredible title track with the Vincent Price narration and the timeless video. The same goes for the tile glowing video 'Billie Jean' or the angsty 'Beat It'. MJ really expresses a &quot;don't mess with me&quot; attitude with class. Beat It will last forever.<br />Most of the rest of Thriller to me is similar to Quincy Jones' 'The Dude' LP.<br />In fact I often enjoy the lesser known songs on Thriller a bit more. Human Nature is absolutely a lovely song and is almost opposite to Thriller. I consider this one of my favorite love songs of my lifetime. Lady In My Life is my other favorite song on Thriller. Sorry dudes but while the whole album is great, The Lady In My Life and Human Nature share the crown as my top favorite songs.<br />The remastered edition includes new liner notes, interviews about the albums making, and a few bonus songs. Someone In The Dark is a very beautiful song although the E.T. singing was a bit jarring. There is a demo version of the huge hit 'Billie Jean' that was recorded before the regular version was eventually made. The last bonus track Carasoul is a bit dissapointing. It's only one and a half minutes long. The song should have been at least three and a half minutes long. Oh Well.<br />At least there are great new liner notes, and great photo stills taken from the video and behind the scenes.<br />Although the remastered edition could have been better this CD is absolutely incredible.<br />It's a shame that so many people my age completely missed this album during it's heyday although it's still immensely popular. I was only about 4 weeks old when it came out but it is one of the earliest memories I have of listening to music.<br />Thriller I bet will more than likely be still available in 2082, 100 years after it's release. It's that good. This CD is timeless.od. This CD is timeless.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I love the old Wilco/country rock sound but I still appreciate what they've done with YHF...geez...listen to the CD as an isolated event...the Beatles went through the same thing when they grew beards and started on about walruses...get over yourselves and hear the songs for themselves...not that I'm any way comparing Wilco to the Beatles...
B00006690F|5.0|There is so much in the news about Eminem: he is a misogynist, a homophobe, a drug addict, a violent thug and so on.  But more than any of that, Eminem is a real guy with real problems and who is not afraid to face up to his own shortcomings, especially on his new album, The Eminem Show.<br />I loved his previous 2 CD's which made me laugh (a lot), think, take pause to be more than a little disturbed and realize that this might be the best rapper out there today.  This CD is his most mature, thoughtful and tight.  If you are an Eminem fan, I think you will enjoy seeing where he has progressed as an artist.  If you have NEVER liked Eminem before, I think this CD could be an eye opener for you.  Eminem never pretends to be perfect, but this CD certainly show his depth of talent and his own ability to cast a trained and critical eye on himself.  The results?  One great CD.
B0000028P8|5.0|With critics having the time of their lives saying that Mariah was just a regular girl with studio magic, Mariah had a lot of fun proving them wrong with her first ever concert, originally taped for MTV Unplugged in 1992. The album begins with &quot;Emotions&quot;, complete with a dramatic piano intro, where Mariah ad libs her heart out. The best part comes at the end, where she takes her whistle tone higher than the heavens above. The audience's applause makes the listening experience even better. &quot;If It's Over&quot; is next, and with the aid of the Saturday Night Live horns, Mariah tears the song up, singing with emotion never heard from her in any previous studio albums. &quot;Someday&quot; tears straight into an a capella version of the bridge, with the capable vocals of Mariah's background singers, who bring a gospel flavor to this song. When &quot;Vision Of Love&quot; begins, the crowd goes wild. The tune is sung beautifully, and the crowd loves it. &quot;Make It Happen&quot; is next, and Mariah sings this without any restraint. The piano playing and gospel singing only adds to this song, which is one of the best tracks of the album. The surprise of the evening came when Mariah launched into &quot;I'll Be There&quot;, possibly the best song of the concert. Trey Lorenz handled his featured solo beautifully, displaying some whistle tone talent of his own on the second bridge. The show closed out with &quot;Can't Let Go&quot;, where Mariah was accompanied only by piano and her background singers, and it was sung with a feeling of pain and fervor, which spoke to all listeners. This is truly one of Mariah's best efforts and everyone is urged to purchase this.
0684847248|5.0|(this is in reference to the old edition - i haven't opened up the newer ones, but i'm assuming the content hasn't changed significantly). a couple of points to just build up on the other reviews:<br />1. to say that this is a &quot;self-help&quot; book i think is a bit unfair - i say this in context of this whole genre of books that promise solutions for the problems in your life but are actually just there to make money of you. i think the book is more a reflection on life that it is anything else - it's just a good book to read. i have the old edition - (1978)....got it from my parents. pages are yellowing already. the book wasn't intended to be in this genre...although it seems with the new editions that that is the direction the publishers are taking it, and are trying to milk it off it's original success. <br />2. to say that peck is an overzealous christian i think is a bit far-fetched. For example, he presents a case wherein his patient, who because of an overly-rigid religious upbrining, and &quot;unquestioning belief&quot; in god grew up to be emotionally damaged and immature - it was only by turning away from religion did she start to mature as a person. On the whole, the book does lean towards chrisitianity but I don't think it is as overbearing as other comments have suggested. Regardless of religion, I think the book has some nuggets of wisdom that everyone can benefit from.
0679601686|5.0|This book made me laugh, it makes fun of the 18 century society and mocks all their greatness. It is a must read, must have. Great way of telling the story and it is bitchin' how all falls into place at the end.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|If it was possible to give this CD no stars, I would have. I am not a fan of Ms Aguilera. I don't like her voice and the way she uses it nor do I care for her image. She ruined the Diane Warren song, \\"These Are The Special Times\\". Celine's version is much better. Christina is a white singer trying to sound black with all of those endless and needless emblishments and constant trilling. Nothing is more annoying. Can't she sing any song normally? I wouldn't describe her voice as beautiful...all she does is scream. She is a teeny bopper pop tart just like Britney Spears, whom I equally despise. If you want to hear a good Christmas album, buy Celine's \\"These Special Times\\", Mariah's \\"Merry Christmas\\" or Jewel's holiday CD.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD! from the depth of SHEEP to the fun and silly BIKE, this cd is a must have for any classic rock fan! i bought it on a whim and now i listen to it all the time. its impossible not to like the infectious tunes of ASTRONOMY DOMINE, HEY YOU, MONEY, ECHOES, THE FLETCHER MEMORIAL HOME, and all the other songs that you cant help loving. definately buy this one, you wont be disappointed!!
038533558X|5.0|Harlan Coben makes his second departure from the Bolitar series (please, Harlan, don't forget Myron Bolitar entirely!) to skillfully plot another great thriller about a missing person!<br />Coben's newest is set in surburban New Jersey and NYC, and his hero is a social worker, Will Klein, whose life is a series of<br />tragedies.  His old girlfriend was brutally murdered, his brother accused and disappeared for the last 11 years, his mother succumbs to cancer, and his girl, Sheila Rogers, disappears and is feared dead.  Will enlists the help of his friend, Squares and Katy Miller, his first love's young sister.<br />He feels compelled to try to unravel what is happening, because the FBI and local law enforcement appear to be involved in a cover-up regarding his brother, Ken.<br />Squares is an enormously entertaining \\"yoga master\\" with a checkered past, and real devotion to his friendship with Will.<br />Another great character that Coben explores is John Asselta, a sociopathic acquaintance of Will's brother, known as \\"The Ghost\\".<br />All in all, Will encounters a lot of evil events in his search for Ken, a search that ends in a group encounter in the last chapter that has more plot twists and turns than I've ever seen.<br />Gone for Good is engrossing, well-written, and makes you care about Coben's main characters.  The women in the book, unlike many suspense novels, are well-defined, and you care what happens to them. Coben succeeds, where others fail, at defining relationships while he builds suspense.<br />Don't miss Coben's latest, it looks like it will top the charts for a good long while, and the only thing to criticize is the neon yellow dustjacket....although it is an improvement from \\"Tell No One's\\" deer hunter orange jacket!<br />Get it, and get into it, as soon as you can!
B000065V9N|5.0|For a long time Peter Gabriel and the idea of a commerical breakthrough seemed polar opposites. With So Gabriel suddenly  demonstrated that there was a market (again) for intelligent and well crafted songwriting. Although not necessarily PG's best, SO functions as a snapshot of the artist in top form.This edition of SO differs a bit from the original US release. The songs differ both from the original album, cassette and CD releases with In Your Eyes as the final track. On vinyl the last song was We Do What We're Told which made sense both artistically and musically. The CD release duplicated the line up of the cassette release featuring Gabriel's collaboration with Laurie Anderson This Is The Picture (Excellent Birds)as the final track.  Reportedly, the track order here was the way the original album was intended to be released. Due to the limitations of vinyl sonics, Gabriel rearranged the line up to the traditional previously released version. The album's original smooth continuity suffers on the remastered edition. The final track (In Your Eyes) is a classic to be sure but putting the chilling We Do What We're Told in its new position robs that powerful track of much of its power. I certainly appreciate the fact that SO is now as its maker intended but there was really nothing wrong with it to begin with.The sound quality is stunning with considerably more depth, clarity and definition. This is particularly noticable on the album opener Red Rain and the two outstanding ballads of the album Don't Give Up and Mercy Street. The latter which is probably one of PG's greatest ballads has more warmth in the sound than ever heard before. SO stands (along with Melting Face aka Peter Gabriel 3) as PG's most compelling and powerful collection of songs. While slicker than Melting Face, it also has a humanity and warmth missing from that dark masterpiece. The two form curious bookends to Gabriel's style and, listened back to back, they each illuminate the other album in unique and powerful ways.The limited edition US digipak is inferior to the traditional vinyl like sleeves issued in Japan. It's something of a bastard child; half vinly artwork/half CD. Really, it doesn't make anyone happy. If the spindle that holds the CD breaks (which, by the way, was the case with half the reissues I purchased), there's no way to replace it. Sadly there are no bonus tracks. Demos, outtakes and b sides would have been welcome. One can understand why Gabriel would want to stick with the original album and not tack on extras; most of the b sides (save the minor classic Don't Break This Rhythm) really would sound of place here. Still, one could argue for the inclusion of the various alternate mixes for Sledgehammer, Big Time and Don't Give Up. I suppose they're saving it for a boxed set so they can fleece the public one more time.The booklet now comes with a number of rare and new pictures. Unfortunately, there's no essay about the making of the album and the credits are standard issue as well. The original song lyrics are included as well but, again, some thoughts on the making of the album would have been interesting.A great album mishandled in its reissue, SO still deserves a place in any CD collection. Gabriel's sweeping stylistic jumps and arrangements finally sound as great (if not, dare I say it, better than) as they did on vinyl. A pity they couldn't have gotten the packaging right.ue and powerful ways.The limited edition US digipak is inferior to the traditional vinyl like sleeves issued in Japan.

B00005JKNB|5.0|It was my birthday when I decided I wanted to watch this movie in the theater. This was Jim Carrey's best movie since The Truman Show. I couldn't believe it! Jim Carrey only acted silly at parts where he was drunk. Other than that, he took on a very serious role and stunned me. I loved this film and you would too. Gosh I thought The truman Show was the best serious role Jim Carrey was in. The Majestic completes it. Thought the end was rather cheesy it was a good movie and I recommend it to anyone who would want a touching, shocking, and lovable film. Jim Carrey isn't only serious in this film, he's fantastic. Buy this movie for what it's worth. I recommend it!
B00006690F|4.0|1st and formost, if you burned this cd off the web, you really should buy it because your cheating a great artist out of money he deserves, and the dvd is pretty cool. <br />I would have given this cd 5 stars but some of the songs i didnt like. Noteworthy songs are definatly my favorite \\"Superman\\" because i, even as a girl, can relate to what he is saying, and im sure a lot of the guys out there will be for it. You gotta hear it. \\"say what you say\\" is awsome as well,gotta love the beat, and his little tounge twister are cute. \\"Hallies Song\\" is so sweet. He doesnt even sound all that bad either. He shows his soft side (as mush as eminem can) in this song, and you can tell he truely loves his little girl. The song with the aerosmith excerpt was great too. Very creative on ems part. \\"Dads gone crazy\\" is a good one too, little Hallie even has a part on it. <br />I cant even descirbe how great this cd is, you just need to get it. Although, people who just like his mainstream stuff may not enjoy it, but his true fans will love it.
B00006690F|5.0|I mean, tho not all the songs on the record are real hard material, but nun of the songs [stinks], it's a solid record with lotta great tracks. cleaning out my closet is emotional, without me is funny as hell, soldier is hard, it got somethin for ey'one in it, and real eminem fans gotta luv 'the eminem show'
B000058983|5.0|Wow. One of those truly rare albums where the 'skip track' button on your CD player will remain totally unused however many times you listen to it. From the beauty of 'andmoreagain' & 'old man', the power of 'bummer in the summer' & 'maybe the people would be the times or between clark & hilldale' to the total madness of 'the red telephone' & 'live & let live', this is drug induced music at its very finest. I hope Love do not enter the 'Napster Generation' - while I want everyone to hear & enjoy Love, one of these tracks, while all beautiful in their own way, would be lost without the others. Here on 'forever changes' are eleven tracks that work superbly off one-another.<BR> I first heard love described as \\"a cross between The Doors, Simon & Garfunkel, The Red Hot Chilli Peppers & lots of acid\\" - how can this not intrigue and excite any true music fan?!?! My copy is now totally unfamiliar with the case, now being just something the CD arrived in, it's home for the past three months has been my CD player itself. I really hope you buy this album. May Arthur Lee's lyrics give you as much to think, smile and enjoy as they do I.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I first heard of Secret Garden when I tuned into the New Age station on the TV, and fell in love instantly with their music and went out to buy one of their CDs.  <br />Songs From a Secret Garden will enchant your soul and mystify your mind with the awesome collection of touching and beautiful songs.  The overall of the CD is very mournful, almost, but gives your heart something to think about.  'Ode to Simplicity' is my favorite song on the album; I could not stop listening to it.  The other songs on this CD are wonderful to listen to as well, especially 'Nocturne' and track 7.  (the title slips my mind at this moment.)<br />If you like to listen to Enya's music then you will definitely like this group.  New Age fans will adore this CD and this group.
B000066C1N|5.0|This album was wonderfully and beautifully composed. I love the whole album, and after listening to Bryan Adam's songs, I am very happy with this CD.

0201633612|5.0|It's been a couple of years since I bought this book, but I never had to time to actually sit down and read it - until now. And what a masterpiece! Having worked in the software industry for more than 10 years, I recognized a lot of the patterns described in this book (though not always by name), but I also discovered a couple of new ones that I will probably find use for in the future. <br />There is not much I can add to what has already been said about this book (just look at the sheer number of positive reviews at this site). It is very informative, yet easy to read. In my opinion, one of the most influential books you can find on software design and patterns.
0345448898|1.0|The author is obviously talented and it's a shame that the thrust of the trilogy was to try to denounce God's existence and authority. In the first book, the author takes a section of chapter 3 in Genesis, adds a few lines of his own and presents it as a direct quote. The second novel denounces God and his place by name and goes to great effort to do so while skillfully weaving this within the fantasy of the story line. The third book states \\"The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\" This was quoted by a character, ironically named Mary, who denounced her faith in God and became a physicist specializing in \\"shadow particles\\". Her character concluded that there was no God and that physics was much more interesting. Portions of the story could have been a wonderful tale and did not need to utilize atheistic theology or undermine faith in God. It presents the Kingdom of God as a tyrannical place that denounces freedom and real thought. The thrust of the books was to overthrow the Kingdom and make it a republic. God was presented as a weak, old deceiver -- an angel claiming to be creator hiding behind the tyranny and hypocrisy of his churches. The main characters were to aid the rebel angels in a new battle, thus creating a republic that would let free thought reign and put them in complete charge of their own destinies. God was unnecessary. I am still trying to determine how this could be considered such good reading material for children.<br />One caveat that I would like to add is that this is NOT an epic story on good versus evil where this time the other side wins.  This author lets the reader get interested in a character and at the end of the first book starts in on a direct battle with God.  But then he gives it minimal effort as to why this is a battle, why there is such a vicious attack on the validity of God's very person, and then lamely says that it's the \\"life stories\\" that are most relevant.  He tries to completely nullify good and evil and then doesn't provide a clear-cut battle ground or resolution.  For an author so capable of depicting the feelings of his characters and making them seem personal, this was beneath his talent and seemed more a venue for expressing his contempt for God and wrapping it around the facade of a children's story.lify good and evil and then doesn't provide a clear-cut battle ground or resolution.

B00000J2PH|5.0|Why has Carol King's 1971 recording Tapestry stood the test of time?<br />  Two words: sincerity and emotion.<br />  The CD I bought from Amazon came with a sticker announcing: \\"4X Grammy Winner! Over 11 Million Sold! Every song's a classic!\\" But that really doesn't explain why, whether you're an \\"old timer\\" who got the original on vinyl or a young person experiencing King for the first time, Tapestry is so fresh, vital and appealing from start to finish.<br />  It's not just King's superb white-soul sing-along melodies, or her music's wonderful rhythms, or the incredible variety of songs on this beautifully remastered CD.  King wrote for a LOT of other artists who recorded her music and became very famous doing so doing the songs on this CD.<br />  Indeed, when she recorded this in 1971 she was not as well-known to the general public as her music -- but that quickly changed when this became one of the great-selling<br />LPs of all time.<br /><br />  The secret is in her unpretentious, 100-per-cent post-liberated woman singing. She means EVERY word, every phrase and it comes across. Each jaunty song is a tasteful, at times playful, mini-drama. People often say that \\"so and so\\" (fill in the blank here) is the female equivalent of Frank Sinatra, considered the King of singing lyrics with supreme sincerity. But the REAL queen is definitely King. Her lyrics (happy and sad) don't just come alive, they're bursting with life-force as much as her music is bursting with worldclass melodies and rhythms.<br />  Example: James Taylor grew increasingly famous (and rich) with his smash recording of You've Got a Friend. But his does not contain one-millionth the sincerity of King's rendition. Anyone who's ever \\"down\\" should listen to her sing the song -- and you'll feel like you do have a friend. And gift this to a beloved friend or relative and tell them THAT SONG is for them and when they listen they will completely get the message, a message King delivers right from the heart.<br />  When the concert-challenged (she did not like to perform in public) King sings her songs the more famous versions of her music performed by more famous artists seem like<br />elevator music in comparison. Her \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" is laced with vulnerability unmatched by any other singer. `It's Too Late\\" takes on a near-defiant tone due to her phrasing.<br />  She also does unparalleled work with the more upbeat songs such as \\"Where You Lead' and (my favorite) `I Feel the Earth Move\\" (our unofficial theme song here in  California).<br />  If you've heard King, get, listen to and savor this remastered CD. If you love someone, gift it. If you're a young musician or singer listen to and EMULATE a master writer and<br />performer. King's lyrics, music, rhythms and sincerity haunted and moved me in 1971 and they do today since this CD is every milligram good as it was when it was first recorded.<br /><br />  According to the liner notes, Tapestry was #1 for 15 weeks, on the charts for more than six years, and earned four Grammies including Record of the Year (for It's Too Late) and<br />Song of the Year (You've Got a Friend.\\" This CD also contains two wonderful previously unreleased bonus tracks.the heart.<br />     When the concert-challenged (she did not like to perform in public) King sings her songs the more famous versions of her music performed by more famous artists seem like<BR>elevator music in comparison.

B00003CXXP|5.0|AI is a film about love. It is sentimental. Why? Because sentiment is beautiful and deep.  This film is a lot deeper than most people understand. It asks questions about society and love, and it doesn't give us answers. It wants us to think. The main character in AI is a robot named David, and at the beginning of the film we think he is only artificial because he seems not to have feelings.  We eventually realize that this robot has ideal qualities of compassion and tenderness that aren't present in any of the people - living or robots - around him.  This leads David in an emotional journey, always looking for love and acceptance and unfortunately never finding it. Does this echo many peoples' lives of unrealized love?  I think it does, and we have unsentimentality to thank for it. We should all learn to love with the tenderness of a child.  <br />   Because David was a robot created with the ability to love, he was unique compared to all that surrounded him.  Nobody could love him. Because David was created with feelings, in many ways he was a real child. But the tragedy is that we created someone with ideal love in a loveless world. David's quest for that love goes on for thousands of years....as all of the people he loved die.  There is no doubt in my mind...AI is a melodrama in the finest sense of the word. It is one of the best love stories since \\"Camille.\\" It made me cry. Anyone that knows how it feels to love someone who can't love you back will understand and be deeply touched by this magnificent, artistic, beautiful film.  Haley Joel Osment displays a gifted talent for conveying love and emotion...he is a great actor.  Jude Law is memorable and eventually heart-breaking as David's robot friend. AI is a classic, with a timeless message about life and love.
0783225792|5.0|This movie is absolutely fantastic.  It plays two roles, a gritty organized crime bit, and a up-and-up business venture.  It's beautiful to see crime boss's meet in the back of a supermarket in the mid-west, while trench men like DeNiro and Pesci are on the front lines making them rich.  I like this movie for a few reasons.  First it brings all aspects into play: there is a hint of media/cop present, there is the inner-workings of the organized crime ladder, there is the business ventures of staying alive in Las Vegas, and to top it off a family to raise.  And it is exciting to see how it all fits together like a puzzle.  Next I like the casting.  I think it is important to have some sort of intimidation and style that is believable.  When Pesci jabs a pen through a guys neck, you get that feeling.  Lastly, the musical score was great.  All-in-all for the true buff of this genre, you owe it to yourself to view this pleasure.  Definately worth it.

B0000027D5|5.0|Lotus is a dream come true.  A recording of two Santana concerts in Osaka, Japan in support of Caravanserai, it blends songs from the group's then-current (mid-70s) jazzy period with old favorites, and is dished out by both the \\"New Santana Band\\" of the time and the \\"Old Santana Band.\\"  Yes, a live Santana CD with Michael Shrieve, Chepito Areas, and Armando Peraza (New) all on percussion!  Tom Coster remains most prominent with his Hammond organ, but Lotus also features Richard Kermode (New) on keyboards.  In substance, only one song from Caravanserai is included, a great version of \\"Every Step of the Way,\\" but Welcome is represented by \\"Samba de Sausalito\\" and the pretty \\"Yours Is the Light.\\"  Coster bedazzles on the rockers from the first three albums as well as Airto's Brazilian jazz \\"Xibaba,\\" one of the best moments in so many great ones.  There is a 16-minute, unforgettable version of \\"Incident at Neshabur,\\" with an extended, lovely coda--What more could you ask for?  Carlos's superpowered guitar is mesmerizing, always; the entire atmosphere is otherworldly, dark, beautiful, modern jazzy (there is also a nod to Chick Corea), and most of all, electrifying.  Early Santana and Lotus rule.
B00000099Y|2.0|I've heard many say that Tool is a great band, especially 'Aenima'.  OK, my curiosity was finally peaked enough to go out and borrow this release, and listen to it 3 times.  I guess it is a matter of personal taste, but I am with some of the previous reviewers who disliked it, even after a few listens.  And I love hard rock and metal.  Tool is a band that seems more concerned with creating sound effects with their instruments, as well as darker chord progressions.  The end result is very dark and angry, but not musical nor groundbreaking in the least.  If you really like good music, do NOT waste your money on this disc!  It is indicative of how rock music has declined in quality over the decades.
B000002NJS|5.0|Fresh Breeze - those were the words that first came to my head to describe &quot;Ray of Light&quot; after hearing it. The music is quite moody and relaxing. Her straightforward lyrics about her increased spirituality, motherhood, and lost love contrast well over William Orbit's layers of electronic effects, live guitar and programmed drums. The best songs are where the electronica and live music blend so perfectly together that they transcend both genres: &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Frozen&quot; which are both enhanced with the cinematic string touches of Massive Attack collaborator, Craig Armstrong, and uptempo tracks like &quot;Swim&quot; and &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; where Madonna recites Yoga Taravoli text over a deep bass Eastern beat. Sometimes, Orbit intentionally floods our ears with a circus packed with beeps, thumping drums and bells e.g. &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Skin&quot; and &quot;Sky Fits Heaven, then balances with subtle arrangements such as &quot;Drowned World&quot;, &quot;Mer Girl&quot; and &quot;Little Star&quot;. Even if you're a Madonna fan longing for the next &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, you won't be turned off by the techno because the songs are still essentially pop.

Africa is a large contintent made up of over 50 countries and several hundred ethnic groups. In the South and the East where the soil is rich and the material benefits large, white settlers can still be found. Fuller conflated a particular white settler Rhodesian childhood with African somehow. Like the South African afronaut, this is a silly claim and misleading if you are truly seeking to read a book on Africa and Africans.<br />On the plus side, she loves animals and gives nice descriptions of the non-human native life forms.
B00000DFSK|4.0|Is U2 the greatest band in the world?  They could very well be, and this collection is a nice survey of their work for the first ten years of the band's recording career.  We're treated to the hits: &quot;Pride,&quot; &quot;With or Without You,&quot; &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday,&quot; &quot;Desire&quot; and so on.  These songs have aged gracefully and still hold up well.  Yet, more discriminating fans will note that this collection is somewhat incomplete.  Where, pray tell, is &quot;Gloria,&quot; one of the most important tracks from their early recording years?  &quot;In God's Country&quot; wasn't as big a hit as, say, &quot;Where the Streets...,&quot; but it was nonetheless one of the stronger cuts off the &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; album.  Unfortunately, that song, too, is missing.  That gripe aside, I still recommend this disc.  The early editon had a bonus disc of b-sides and rarities.  If you can find a copy, you should get your hands on one.  Otherwise, this single-disc edition will do.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I was bowled over by Mulholland. I had read nothing about the movie before I went to see it, just going on the merits of Lynch as a director. I have always loved his style of directing and vision. There is always a good-natured naiveté about his work. Something very pure and honest (this is why he goes on about the quality of coffee in his movies, I think)and of course very very weird.  He loves filmmaking and it shows. His work is uncompromising and pure. It is brave and very rare in Hollywood.<br />Mulholland Dr follows into that vein but there is an underlying tone of evil from the beginning that is fed by the goody goody nature of Betty (just too good to be true..too wide eyed and innocent) and the leering old couple when they leave Betty on the pavement of LA airport. But you just don't know where Lynch is taking you with this. I just let it wash over me and it was astonishing. Creepy, funny and devastating the story is a loop but you only find that out, of course, at the end of the movie... It Ends where it began.  It doesn't deal with normal time notions but it gives you clues as to what state of reality Betty/Diane is in.<br />Just look for the ashtray in the shape of the Piano. The lampshade and the robe and the hairstyle... If you keep your eye on that you will know what is real and what isn't.<br />But then the question is.. What does it all mean? The Blue Box? The key? The Cowboy, Silencio? The bum, The old Couple? The Thugs, No one can answer that (perhaps not even David Lynch) but one can only guess... and that is just part of the fun of this movie. There is no wrong answer but the symbolism is logical to a degree. (Think Pandora's box, the key is the key to Diane's release of her obsession, Silencio the calm before death, or death itself, The old couple her innocence lost..coming back to haunt her,  The thugs are validating her belief that the director was bullied into choosing Camilla and had nothing to do with Diane's lack of talent or star quality) It stays with you long after you have left the cinema. Like some vivid dreams they can baffle you as to their meaning but make you richer for having them... I was bowled over by Mulholland. Even after seeing it three times.
B000001EAQ|5.0|While Depeche Mode abandoned their electronic roots for rock a few years ago, U2 did the exact opposite: they strayed from their rock roots to dabble with electronica.  The result is &quot;Pop&quot;: their most electronic-sounding album to date.  Yet, for all the occasional synths and drum loops, &quot;Pop&quot; is a rock album all the way.  &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot; and the dynamite &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot; are classic U2, as is &quot;Do You Feel Loved.&quot;  However, I think fans were most turned off by &quot;MoFo,&quot; which sounds more appropriate on a Prodigy album, to be very honest.  This album didn't flop, but it didn't exactly sell through the roof like &quot;Actung Baby&quot; (the group's sole classic of the 1990's).  Too bad, because &quot;Pop&quot; really has enough merits to stand on its own as a great album.
B00001ODHF|5.0|Using advanced scientific techniques, I've isolated the three basic reasons why Sam Raimi's \\"Army of Darkness\\" exists.  They are:<br />1.  To quench the appetite of those Raimi-files not sated by the gore-and-goofiness of \\"The Evil Dead\\" and \\"The Evil Dead II\\":<br />Yes, it's pretty gory:  A fire hose caliber spray of blood erupts from a torture pit; an evil deadite appears to have no lips or skin; animated skeletons get run over by a beat up yellow Oldsmobile.  But thankfully, it is also very goofy: the arms of buried bodies poke through the ground to perform a neatly choreographed Three Stooges routine; an army of mini-Bruce Campbells appears, and attack their Gulliver-sized doppelganger, Lilliputian-style; an evil witch is blown to pieces by a double-barreled department store shotgun, as the audience gets the bullets'-eye-view.  The meshing of gore and goof is a Raimi trademark, and it is in no small supply here.  Prepare to hold your stomach, because you'll either have the urge to vomit, or need to hold in your omnipresent laughter.<br />2.  To show off contemporary versions (circa 1990) of Ray Harryhausen-esque stop-motion techniques:<br />The special effects, while dated in the face of CGI prodigiousness, are enormous and spectacular.  A vast skeletal army emerges from the darkness, each with his/her own unique personality and movement.  The battle they undertake is credible and real and awe-inspiring.  It is ridiculously hyper-kinetic, full of carnage and mayhem, more than any climactic fight scene I've ever seen.  Never put anything past Sam Raimi.  Even on a miniscule budget he can create something that'll knock your socks off, and tickle your feet.<br />3.  To give the glorious Bruce Campbell more moments to shine.<br />Above all else, this is the real reason why this movie exists (Raimi thinks so: by the opening credits alone you'd swear the movie was called \\"Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness\\").  Campbell has the unique ability to play Ash, hero of thefirst two \\"Evil Dead\\" movies, as both intensely cool and dumb as a post.  It's a nice mix that allows him to display the pomposity of a superhero and the self-awareness of a post-modern ironist.  One scene in particular shows this off nicely.  It takes place in a graveyard, in front of an altar where the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) is kept.  Only there are three books, a number Ash wasn't expecting.  Casually opening the first one, he reveals a powerful vacuum/vortex, sucking into its gaping maw all that come near.  Ash is one of the first casualties.  But he emerges heroically, unharmed except for a ridiculously elongated chin.   The joke is that Campbell's chin is his most notorious selling point (he called his autobiography \\"If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B-movie Actor\\").  Mocking himself so mercilessly, it becomes an even more delicious moment.<br />His other skill, besides his self-deprecating sense of humour, is his delivery.  Raimi and his brother Ivan deliver an almost purposefully banal script, knowing full well that the verve and intensity of Campbell's delivery will amplify its humour.  And they're right.  Ash's lines, so eminently quotable, appear rather dull when typed out (\\"Groovy\\", \\"Hold on Mr. Fancy Pants\\", \\"Baby you got ugly\\", and \\"Baby give me some sugar\\" being the most notorious examples).  The power comes from the way Campbell's reading is combined with the way Raimi sets up these lines perfectly: a dramatic pause, then a quick zoom in on Bruce's loopy mug, then the slick delivery of the line.  It's an addictive concoction that had me roaring in delight each time.  Furthermore, add the fact that all the actors around him play their scenes stone straight, and you find yourself wondering why Campbell isn't a bigger star.<br />\\"Army of Darkness\\" will not add up to much for those uninitiated with (or underwhelmed by) the \\"Evil Dead\\" series.  But for those that are, it's more of the good times promised by Raimi and Co.  Check your mind at the door, paste a goofy grin on your face (you'll need it later), and get set for 81 minutes of mirth and mayhem.
B000001G1E|5.0|When I hear young people talk about what great grooves today's rappers have, I want to just grab them by the ear and make them listen to this entire box set.  Hip-hop was not invented in 1993 by Tupac; it started here!!  Everyone owes a debt to the Godfather of Soul.  If you can play someone this set, and their toes are not tapping, you better call 911 cuz they're dead.  Today's young people certainly don't know enough about history, but they also need to be made aware of musical history, which to many fans like me, might just be more important.  This box set might just be the greatest Christmas present you ever receive.  Ask Santa now!!!!
B00005LC1H|5.0|When i first watch Fawlty Towers i was on the floor laughing my head off my husbane is so into comedy and he loves Fawlty Towers John Cleese would have to be one of the best actors of all time everyone in my house loves a good laugh and i have to give my thanks to the team of Fawlty Towers for so much laughter in my house Thank you...You are the best...
6305171769|4.0|As Chucky (& his love) finally revived his power with the third sequel, so this famous John Carpenter classic film got a modest, well-deserved treatment with this fairly good installment.  And looking back from now, it is a miracle that stars like Josh Hartnett (\\"Pearl Harbor\\" and \\"Black Hawk Down\\") and Michelle Williams (\\"Dick\\") have been brought in here (Well, but once Renee Zelweger was in a 1995 sequel of \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacare\\" so ... remember that?).  Well, this is what we call muscle of now influential studios Miramax and Dimention Films.<br />The story is very simple.  Just forget the other sequels, and consider yourself transported to 20 years later.  Now Mike Meyers's sister (Jamie Lee Curtis returning to her \\"Screaming Queen\\" role with very apt opening entrance with her BIG scream), still afraid of the terrible events years ago, is found in a posh private high school, where she is now principle.  She is living with her son (Hartnett), who thinks, quite understandably, his mother is over-protective.  But why, he does not know Mike brandishing a knife, and this Mike is supposed to be burnt to death ... until now.<br />With a well-crafted, complicated opening scenes which show  clearly the touch of acclaimed writer Kevin Williamson (co-producer here), \\"Halloween H20\\" starts promisingly, gradually setting the background of each possible victims.  The film, though never overcoming the handicaps of being a sequel, which naturally has to preserve the rules the original made, fares pretty well, always keeping a good pace.  Steve Miner (known with Lake Placid\\" and many others) knows how to engage our interests even though not his skills are not on par with that of Wes Craven, whose \\"Scream\\" series have something in common with this film: funny in-jokes about horror film genre, and a bit predictable, but still well-executed set-pieces.  <br />Probably, those who have seen the original \\"Holloween\\" and many other older films (like \\"Psycho\\") can get more joy from this sequel.  If you haven't seen them, I suggest strongly see them before watching this.  You may miss many things, without which, you can still enjoy yourself, though, and the ending of the film (which reminds us of that of another famous horror film) is not a little surprsing, considering the fact that this franchize is still going on.  But OK, forget it. <br />The best thing of this film is, in my book, the welcome re-entrance of Jamie Lee Curtis (whose mother Janet Leigh, in ... what else, \\"Psycho,\\" can be seen as a cameo).  LL Cool J also appears as a guard.<br />Overall, satisfactory, if not perfect, this is a unexpected revival of the series that seem once dead already.  My verdict about the work per se is actually 3 stars, but with its good, tongue-in-cheek reference to the genre, one star up.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|... This film, the story of the frustrated artist who longs to be creative free from the rules of the established order, who goes on to win the hearts of his audience while the \\"establishment\\" looks on disapprovingly and refuses to grant innovation it's due reward could well be said to mirror director Baz Luhrman's own career.<br />This film is a David & Goliath and Cinderella story set in the world of Australian ballroom dancing. And if that seems the most boring idea for a film imaginable then you couldn't possibly be more wrong. For this is a brilliantly innovative and satirical look at the world of ballroom dancing with great camera shots, angles, and has a simple story that belies the fact that it is really quite complex and subltlely plotted. It really repays repeated viewings to catch all of it's themes and ideas and it's brimful of them.<br />The developing relationship between the two principal characters is cinema magic. Mecurio, a professional dancer, said in in interview after this, his first acting experiance that they \\"hit it off right from the start\\" and that \\"she taught me (to act) as much as I taught her to dance\\" and it shows. Tara even sings \\"Time after Time\\" in the movie and her voice is terrific. The chemistry between the two really gives this film great heart and grounds it amongst all the silliness going on around them. And what great comedy it is. From Barry Fife the ADF president to Scott's mum there are some terrific comedy performances here. (Sadly, Pat Thomson, who plays Scott's mum, died before this film was released.) Even though she scrubs up well Fran is still not the best looking girl around and you really do believe Scott falls in love with her because of her courage, determination, and integrity rather than because of her good looks. The film's brilliant finale is not one you'll forget in a hurry either. Great camerawork and terrific storytelling really keep the tension alive and the result will have you cheering as loudly as the audience in the film. If the purpose of good cinema is to inspire and leave the heart soaring then this film succeeds brilliantly.<br />This film was one of Australia's biggest hits of 1992 and it made household names out of it's stars, and Tara Morice is one of Australia's best known and respected actresses today. Although she spends more time being a partner and mother these days she still finds time for occasional zero budget films and TV and stage appearances every now and then. Craig Pearce who co-wrote this film with Luhrman and who has the enviable postion of being Mr Tara Morice also co-wrote \\"Moulin Rouge\\" and Tara has a very small part in it, just at the very beginning of the film as the camera ducks under an archway, there she is.<br />This low budget masterpiece, Luhrman's first film, is an unmissable treat for all ages, a true family film. It should become a classic.
B00005T30L|4.0|Alright. I love Thora Birch. She puts mannequin actresses like Shannon Elizabeth and Sarah Michelle Gellar to shame. So there's no possible way I could dislike something she was in. And indeed, Ghost World was astounding in so many ways. I am Enid, in many areas, and myself and those like me are the audience this film is intended for, those of us who KNOW (not think) the majority is stupid. Those of us who KNOW pop culture is vapid, and those of us who find joy in tearing down even the most sacred of hollow traditions. <br />However, if you want the FULL enjoyment of a movie like this, then I sincerely reccommend picking up the Ghost World screenplay. I bought it long before I saw the film, and I was blown away. So I was more than a little disappointed when a lot of what made the screenplay great was left out of the movie, like Enid's infatuation with Josh, Seymour's fight with Dana, and so on. Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes put together a much better script than the final film.<br />My only other major reservation was the extremely unfunny and unsympathetic performance by Scarlett Johansen. I understand she's supposed to be cynical and disinterested, but there were times I had to turn the volume up just to hear what she said. It was that inarticulate. She was much better in The Man Who Wasn't There, but she did absolutely nothing for this movie, and I cringed every time she talked because it just brought the movie down so much. <br />And finally, a word to all of you who &quot;didn't get&quot; this movie: stick with American Pie. This obviously isn't your kind of humor, and you're obviously not who it's intended for. Because we all know American Pie is sooooooo funny :(
B00005B36H|5.0|First of all, I am a big Tool fan and must say that this album is not necessarily \\"softer\\" than any of their other albums, namely Aenima, (just listen to \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" for proof), but it is definitely different than the others.  The reason I have to say that this album is their best is because, like a concept album, it works as a whole CD, it flows wonderfully from song to song, just like NIN's The Fragile.  <br />Tool may have made some better songs in the past, especially \\"Eulogy,\\" but then they disrupted the rest of Aenima with \\"Message to Harry Manback,\\" \\"Die Eier Von Satan,\\" and especially \\"Intermission.\\"  If they had removed those tracks, or replaced them with more fitting instrumentals, like \\"Eon Blue Apocalypse\\" on Lateralus, the album would have had a much better flow, would have kept a more consistent tone, and could have actually been a superior album to Lateralus.  Before I start going into more detail about the album, I must say that you have to give this album time to sink in, you'll probably like it after the second or third time listening to it all the way through.<br />There is just not a bad song on this whole album.  \\"The Grudge\\" eases you into the album kind of the same way that \\"Eulogy\\" builds up to the actual singing.  I love the chanting sound at the beginning of the song and lyrics like, \\"Clutch it like a cornerstone, Otherwise it all comes down... Saturn ascends.\\"  Then, \\"Eon Blue Apocalypse\\" slows you down for \\"The Patient,\\" which is one of the most reflective Tool songs I can remember.  Then \\"Mantra\\" transitions you into \\"Schism.\\"  The way that Maynard sings \\"I know the pieces fit\\" has always made me wonder if he's stating it as a fact or trying to convince you and possibly himself of this, it's similar to a question of narrative reliability in a novel, you're never really sure what to believe.  This is the kind of the thing that adds to the surreal sound of Tool, which is what first drew me to them.  My favorite part on the album isthe quiet \\"Parabol\\" and then the crashing guitar to start \\"Parabola\\", which ranks right up there with \\"Eulogy\\" as songs go.  <br />Next, comes \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" which is much harder and angrier than any track on the album, harking back almost to the Opiate EP.  Then comes the title track, I'd say almost a tie with Parabola for the best song on the album.  More great lyrics like, \\"Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.\\"  \\"Disposition\\" usually passes without most people noticing.   Things move on to the fairly quiet, but very good \\"Reflection.\\"  Then an instrumental, \\"Triad\\", as epic and interesting as \\"Orion\\" from Metallica's Master of Puppets ends the \\"musical part of the disc.  Any Tool fan knows that there's always got to be something strange, that's not really a song.  This would be the last track, a guy talking about experiences at Area 51, which sounds like the end of the X-Files Soundtrack only not obnoxiously rambling.  It sounds like it might be out of place but its weirdness actually fits, unlike the delightfully funny \\"Cries of the carrots\\", Track 69 on Undertow.<br />This album will take on a great musical journey that will not get old, if you're willing to let it.  It's like taking the step between Radiohead's The Bends and OK Computer, if you give Lateralus a few good complete listens, with headphones preferably driving in the car does not really allow you to appreciate the album properly, you will discover what so many have been talking about when they tell you about how great this album really is.
0140186395|5.0|\\"East of Eden\\" is a truly wonderful story in which explores the meaning behind evil and good and contains incredible character psychology. The main storyline of this book follows the inevitable cycle of two generations of brothers in the Trask family to live out the classic Cain and Abel story. Two brothers live in conflict as one receives love from a father figure while the other does not. It is interesting alone to watch how each brother progresses in his character so that the generation flaws will be repeated. The story alone is well written, but it is the characters that truly drive the storyline. Throughout the whole novel, I find myself trying to find out why a certain character does the things they do, pondering upon their psychology. The character of Cathy is definitely one that will keep you on your seat. Cathy is a character in which has no sense of goodness within her and has the power to manipulate people to her will. Throughout the story, I find myself completely attached to the book just to find out more about Cathy so that I could analyze her behavior. When I thought I understood her character, she would do something that would change my whole view of her. Her character becomes even more complex as it is intertwined with Biblical references as well. The characters all are complex and as deep as Cathy. I do have to admit that the characters initially seemed odd in the first third of the book. Cathy uses her \\"body\\" to get her way and Adam, Cathy's husband, is completely oblivious to everything around him, but the characters eventually grown on the reader. Each of the characters explores the different parts of human psychology. One characteristic that becomes familiar is the damage of broken families on children. One character develops a fake imaginary world in order to cope with the fact that his mother was no longer with him. The depth of characters is so great that you will find yourself reading on just to find out more information on the characters.<BR>     The characters are great but also the theme of good and evil also plays a major part in the story's greatness. This story questions the actual what good and evil are. It truly makes the readers think about the good and evil in their lives, whether the book is right or not. With the good and evil theme, the option of choice comes into play. The reader will grow familiar with the word \\"timshel\\". This is the Jewish word relating to the choice of mankind. \\"East of Eden\\" specifically refers to the Biblical wording of the Adam and Eve story. In the original manuscripts of the Bible, God actually said mankind \\"mayest\\" conquer over sin rather than the common belief that mankind will conquer sin. It puts the choice of man to whether or not conquer sin. In the story, the character of Cal has to choose whether he will follow the path of his mother sin or to live his own life. Cal believes that the sins of his mother have passed on to him. All this and more are contained in the book \\"East of Eden\\". The philosophy will keep you thinking about not only the story's characters, but also your own life. <BR>     \\"East of Eden\\" is an entertaining story about the story of Cain of Abel being repeated through generations of brothers. However, its main strength is the fact that it makes the reader think. Whether it be about the character psychology or the philosophy of the book, the reader will be captivated by the complexity of the book. Though the concepts may be complex, the characters are used in a way in which they will embody such concepts. In this way, the concepts become as clear as daylight to any reader. Overall, this book is great for those who like to be intrigued and to follow growth of individual characters.
B00005JKL8|3.0|OK, this is a typical American-made military movie.  Yes, I can say that, because I AM an American.  There are lots of explosions, bullets flying everywhere, etc., and it's all based on a true story!<br />It's really not bad.  Owen Wilson is spot on as a Navy flier fed up with milk runs and police duty.  He's turned in his resignation and is just clocking time till his service is up.  On a recon mission, he and his pilot spot unusual activity \\"off the beaten path\\" in territory that is supposed to be off limits. Their plane gets shot down as they do an unauthorized flyover, getting them caught \\"Behind Enemy Lines.\\"  The plot follows Owen's character, the sole survivor, as he tries to reach a safe rescue spot.  As these kind of movies go, it's very watchable.<br />Well, there were a few places where you think, \\"No way is anybody going to go through all that and walk away.\\"  Hollywood bad guys never can shoot worth a darn.  I thought the ending in particular was way over the top, but what the heck.  I'm not sorry we rented it.
B00005QZWI|4.0|I have seen the movie five times, and I never really noticed the music all that much (the visual stills keeps me enthralled).  When I got the CD I put it in, and really wasn't 'captured' by it.  However on the second listen it started to pull me in, the third listen hooked me for good.  By the fourth listen I was re-living the movie in my mind.  I really like the fact that the tracks follow the movie score, it doesn't jump around, so you can follow the movie in your mind,<br />Why didn't I give it five stars?  To me a rating of 5 stars means everything is perfect!!!  I will almost never give out five stars, but this is 4 1/2.  The tracks by Anya, nice, but not spectacular.  On another note: the last time I saw the movie my wife and I were treated to previews of 'THE TWO TOWERS'.  I can hardly wait.
B000002J1I|5.0|...There will never be another Close to the Edge...I don't want YES to always do what is expected, what fan does? Seems there was a cloud of anxiousness in the atmosphere when Yes made this album...Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson would leave right after...The \\"let's just get it done\\" mood, ironically,gives it its distinctive driving force...Squire, Howe, and White - Rock n Rolls finest trio - shine and show their talents and tightness...The intro to \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" is awesome, \\"Release, Release\\" is great. \\"Circus of Heaven\\" and \\"Onward\\" are great. One of YES's only protest songs appear in the song \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\" ...buy it...great cruising cd!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000J7SS|5.0|If you've never heard this album before, you've probably never heard anything like it before. Yes, it's an &quot;essential&quot; collector's recording, documenting a sea change in jazz studio work. And yes, Miles' ensemble here went on to become Weather Report, Mahavishnu Orchestra, and some of the other seminal fusion bands. But this album is like nothing before or since. <br />Appreciation requires close, attentive *listening*. It's about the interplay of musicians and development of themes over 20+ minute tracks. The sheer brilliance of the artists requests and requires our respectful attention. My focus shifts from listening to listening, but these days i'm caught up in the interplay of drummers Jack DeJohnette and Lenny White. Other times i've marveled at Bernie Maupin's bass clarinet, or the interplay of three electric pianos, and of course Miles' guidance coming in the form of exquisitely phrased trumpet. <br />I will listening to this album the rest of my life. And i will not be bored.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden's disk Affirmation takes us on yet another saucy, impetious and yet meaningful ride into the world of pop-rock music. The group has grown more mature with this latest album which includes many more lively songs than its predecessor. Of course everyone has heard the infamous &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; that has topped the charts for weeks now, but fans will be surprised at the rest of the worthy songs on the disk.<br />The title track features good lyrics and a catchy tune but only stumbles on a few minor points that are personal blips. The rest of the songs deal with love, infatuation, warnings, and last chances, but the CD's most unexpected track is &quot;Two Beds and a Coffee Machine,&quot; which takes on domestic abuse, and views from the side of a battered wife. <br />My personal favorites are &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; (another hit radio song), &quot;Crash and Burn,&quot; and &quot;Gunning Down Romance,&quot; for its lethargic lyrics, but I play the disk from beginning to end. There's no skip here, unlike a lot of other groups that I enjoy. For new fans and old, Affirmation aims to please.
B000060P79|5.0|This album is for punk lovers. It's filled with awesome songs and great music.
B00006690F|5.0|I have been buying eminems cds starting from when he was on the underground scene and i think his style has dramaticly changed but i still think he is by far the realest mc out there!
B00003CXS4|4.0|Three smoking barrels is what Guy Ritchie said he hoped this movie wouldn't be.  Well... It is.  Fortunately for him I liked Lock-Stock, and I think Snatch is actually a slightly better movie.  If you like complex interweaving story-lines, then Guy Ritchie's your man.  The only real difference between this and Lock-Stock, is Snatch had a few more experimental camera shots and surreal settings than I remember Lock-Stock having.  Funny, Brutal, and Interesting.
B000066C1N|5.0|This is one hot cd! The music on it is a mixture of slower songs and ones with a more upbeat tempo. When I saw the movie, I thought it was fine, but I immediatly had to purchase the soundtrack ! It is incredible, really showing Bryan Adams' diverse styles of singing! You will not regret purchasing this soundtrack, as it will become a loved family piece...better yet while you're at it buy 2 or 3 of these soundtracks, because you'll listen to this so often the cd will become unreadable from all of the playing scratches!!!
B00005V9HH|4.0|A very good movie, but if you've heard that there's a surprise ending (which most of these reviews point out) you'd have to be an idiot to not know what it is 1/4 of the way through the movie. So don't watch it for a \\"Sixth Sense\\" caliber twist, watch this movie for the story telling.
B0000640SA|4.0|I waited until the Limited Edition of Memento was released to see it for a second time. I was plesantly surprised. Not only can you watch the film with director Christopher Nolan's commentary but you can also watch the film in chronological order. It is amazing that backward or forward...the film works both ways and is one of the best psychological thrillers in years. Memento is that rare film that can be looked at over and over again and you will always find something that you missed the first time around. Highly recommended.
B0000399WI|5.0|I don't think I can say enough good things about this movie.  Great performances by Freeman and Robbins.  Great story telling made intensely more effective with Freeman's narration.  Characters you can truly empathize with.  A really beautiful movie.
B00006690G|5.0|I've been looking forward to this album for a long time now since the \\"Marshall Matthers LP\\".It's  has been almost 2 years since Em put out a solo album. He has definitely not dissapointed with this project. 15 solid tracks with 3 skits excluding intro and outro. I cant really pick out a \\"best\\" track because they are all good. Eminem spits heavy lyrics in every song and really takes his time to perfect his rhymes.In my opinion, this album is better than his previous 2 hot projects. No more \\"playful\\" type stuff, just business.Album is definitly worth [the] bucks.If you like him, pick up this joint, if not, still pick it up.
B00005UKE0|5.0|By the time the Beatles had broken up in 1970, George Harrison was already working on his first official solo album (His Wonderwall and Electronic Sound projects were instrumental not solo recordings) 'All Things Must Pass'.  When with the Beatles, George was generally given two songs on each album therefore he had tons of songs in the can for his 1970 solo debut.  It was already evident that George was a master songwriter with such Beatles track as 'Something' and 'Here Comes The Sun'.  All Things Must Pass could very well be considered the finest Beatles solo album.<br />The album starts off on a slow note with the beautiful I'D HAVE YOU ANYTIME but quickly kicks into the hit MY SWEET LORD.  WAH-WAH and WHAT IS LIFE are wonderful up beat rockers.  ISN'T IT A PITY was the double sided hit (with MY SWEET LORD) though I find it a tad long and depressing.  IF NOT FOR YOU and BEHIND THAT LOCKED DOOR show Harrsion's country rock side.  LET IT DOWN is a beautiful tune and RUN OF THE MILL has some nice guitar work.  The bonus tracks on disc 1 are quite impressive.  I LIVE FOR YOU is rather quirky and WHAT IS LIFE is just the backing track but BEWARE OF DARKNESS and LET IT DOWN are wonderful acoustic takes and MY SWEET LORD(2000) has some improved guitar work but Harrsion's vocals are a little worn still worth a listen though.<br />The second disc starts with an easy going BEWARE OF DARKNESS.  APPLE SCRUFFS is fun.  BALLAD OF SIR FRANKIE CRISP(LET IT ROLL) has a folky feeling to it and AWAITING ON YOU ALL is another up beat rocker.  The title track ALL THINGS MUST PASS is a beautiful anthem.  I DOIG LOVE is a quirky piano number.  ART OF DYING is another rocker.  ISN'T IT A PITY (VERSION 2) is a nice reprise and HEAR ME LORD is the wonderful album closer.<br />I have neglected to metion the APPLE JAM.  Now don't get me wrong it is okay to listen to once!  However I find it rather annoying and boring.  It is not something I would listen to repeatedly but it does have some good guitar despite it's rather shoddy quality.<br />The 2001 reissue of this fantastic album has special packaging to replicate the original vinyl LP record.  However if you want to store these cd's safely purchase a double cd case or cd carrier along with this album.  It would be more appropriate than the little cardboard slots that hold the cd's.<br />Overall All Things Must Pass is an essential album of 1970.  Harrsion may have produced the best Beatles solo album ever!  It was unfortunate that he passed away but thankfully he left us this remastered marvel of musical genius.  Thank you George!  God speed!  Highly recommended!
038533558X|5.0|I usually shy away from books that are written in first person, however I decided that I would give this one a try.  This was one of the best books I have read in a very long time and I usually read a book a week.  There is a cliff hanger at the end of just about every chapter that makes you keep reading and reading until the very end.

B00000I2UC|4.0|The Mary Chain is one of my all-time favorite rock band and I have most of their stuff, minus the b-albums and others.  All their albums have great songs, but I like Automatic the best because most of the songs are great and it is the most rockin' Mary Chain album by far.  The two throwaway songs are &quot;gimme hell&quot; and &quot;sunray&quot;, but besides that, it is a strong album.  &quot;PsychoCandy&quot; gets all the critics review but I can take only so much feeback; I need some real substance.  &quot;Darklands&quot; was the first Mary Chain album that really caught me, and it's a good one with it's catchy melodic tunes.  Honey's Dead is good also, but I keep refering back to Automatic with it's catchy hard rockin' tunes!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Like Alanis, Shakira's music is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. Of course, even non-devoted fans are not going to be able to resist the catch first single 'Whenever, Wherever' (and its Spanish counterpart 'Suerte' - which literally means &quot;luck&quot; or &quot;fortune&quot;). Shakira's voice is raw, which explains why it cracks every now and then. But that's just her - she is vocally gifted to say the least, and she is also a great lyric and music composer. 'Poem to a Horse' is my least favourite track and doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Yet, I still listen to it because it is very creative and off the wall. I think that is what makes Shakira so appealing to so many people; This is not Britney territory. Every song is unique, both lyrically and musically, and is unlike anything this world has ever heard before. Shakira is just what the the pop music industry needs: Fresh talent that is loaded with creativity. I hope 'Eyes like Yours' will someday be a single, with its awesome Arabic flavour and fast paced rhythms. Originally written as 'Ojos Asi,' the English version does not take anything away from the original Spanish version, and, if anything' just adds more to this exciting tune. Shakira is here to stay, and I could not be happier with her English debut.
B00003CXI1|4.0|The DVD was very entertaining even though we saw the movie twice in the theaters (once with our 4 yr old granddaughter). What was even more fun was the second DVD. My husband and I had a great time searching for things on the DVD and can't wait to try the 'extra credit' on the CD-ROM.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Once again, No Doubt has transformed its addicting sound.  Rock Steady is an album that is all about fun.  The music makes you groove and dance around.  The lyrics are amazing and are easy to relate to.  Don't be afraid of the band's different sound, it just demonstrates their diversity as artists.
B00005PJ8I|4.0|I have seen this movie on HBO, and I had multiple feelings to it. Watching this movie, I had several different reactions.  One was the horror I felt during the crash scene--very horrifying.  Another was amazement-- amazement at what a person will do to survive under the most desperate circumstances.  Yet another reaction I had was sadness--I really felt sorry for Chuck as he was sobbing after losing Wilson, his only &quot;friend&quot; on the island.  I also felt sorry for him when he comes back home, eager to see his girlfriend after four long years, only to find that she is now married to someone else and has a child. I also felt that what happened to Chuck was a matter of fate--I think this incident needed to happen so that he could be forced to see what was really important in life-- the need to slow down and cherish relationships more.  &quot;Cast Away&quot; is a movie that will evoke your emotions as it did with me.
B00006690F|5.0|I dunno what ATL Playa was thinkin, but the MMLP was def. a classic, u cant tell me that wasent ment to go down in history. And He must have no taste in music. This album is on of eminems best to date. <br />I have always enjoyed his album, which most of the time just [make people mad]. But this time its different. He is talkin about what he is thinking about.<br />The beats are great on this album, and as usuall he spits mad well. even when he sings (hailies song) it is interesting and fun to listen to. Til i collapse is also a great pump up song so i dont see where ATL Playa is comin up with callin it garbage. This album is worth the 13 doller. Dont think, just pick it up. The music is great and it is going to have great replay value, the songs just dont get old. ATL Playa has no clue what he is talking about, dont go by what he says, hes wrong
B00001OH82|4.0|...I consider it a Bowie classic. Deconstructed from his elaborate eariler efforts, this cuts too the bone with an alternative sound pre-dating Nirvana by several years.  While this does not stand up to classics like Scary Monsters or Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust, it is a hell of a lot better than Let's Dance or some of Bowies other recent works.  Give it a shot!

B00003CXI1|4.0|All right, so the movie is awesome(as are the books). I love Harry, and Ron and Hermione are very cute together. I knowmany people say it is too much like the book-- I don't understand the problem with this. The book comes alive in this first installment. <BR>The DVD itself though, is very FRUSRSTING. It was so hard for me to find the deleted scenes that I had to go online to figure it out. I like the idea of making a quiz out of finding the scens, but the way it is set up is not very logical.<br />So, the movie is great, but the DVD needs a bit more work.

0792838912|4.0|I love this movie.  To me, it is basically a mood piece.  The acting, scenery, and lighting are all well done.  It's very romantic and seems to depict a relationship that's true to life.  I think that the way it ended seemed realistic as well.  There was so much passion between the two main characters, that things eventually turned out badly between them.
B000063S6Z|1.0|Uggh.  When will you all wake up and realize this person is a hack?  Am I the only one who notices that Moby's primary songwriting technique is stitching a few paltry loops together and playing them OVER and OVER and OVER until the listener wants to scream?  It's pathetic, especially when there are so many artists out there with actual talent who are starving while this moron is raking in the bucks like there's no tomorrow.  Wise up.  Pull your heads out.  Stop and think for a minute and see if you can actually think up two or three concrete reasons why you really \\"like\\" this drivel.  Moby is garbage.
0694003611|3.0|This book has a wonderful reputation, but it did not live up to it in my mind. The story line is practically nonexistent as a child tells of the things in his bedroom and then says goodnight to each one in turn. The repetition and rhyming couplets aid in the decoding of words and rhythm of the speech. However, the rhyming and too frequent use of the word \\"and\\" mimic neither speech patterns nor the conventions of writing. It must be explained to children beforehand that the text is poetic and not prose. The text can be hard to read in places with red lettering over a purple background. The illustrations switch from colorful, rich cartoons to black and white isolated sketches, which is characteristic of the times when it was published (to save money).  But, they do give a feeling of discontinuity. This book did nothing special for me and I don't plan on using it in my classroom...
B00005QZWI|5.0|Composer Howard Shore has produced a musical landscape as far and wide as Tolkien's Middle Earth for THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING soundtrack.  Much as cultural styles were varied for all the different races and places, Shore has composed playfully and lightly for the Hobbits, darkly for the Orcs, grandly for the battles and all along the scale for all the other musical emotional moments.<br />The use of Celtic vocals is gentle and well-placed.  The Oscar nominated single by Enya &quot;May It Be&quot; rounds out the collection.
B00006690F|5.0|Considering Eminem's last two albums created contraversy with songs that were made to test the public's attitudes towards rap, this one takes an entirely different route. Eminem has proved that he can become a much more serious rapper, with less dis'es on this album, and emotionally packed songs like \\"Cleaning out My Closet\\" \\"Till I collapse\\" \\"Soldier\\" and even a track where he attempts to sing (and pulls it off in a weird sort of way) dedicated to his daughter \\"Halies Song\\". <br />Now I will admit there are some tracks that do lag, like \\"Drips\\" a horrible song featuring D12, as well as his new one \\"Without Me\\", which sound awful. <BR>Probably the most stand out track is \\"White America\\", where Eminem comes charging out the gates ready to tear it up again, which was a great choice for the first real track on the \\"show\\". Especially since he lays it down to Ms. Cheney and Tipper Gore where he yells \\"F YOU\\" to both of them, because as you all know, they are the main advocates of censorship which of course violates Em's 1st ammendment right to freedom of speech. So in closing, this is his best album yet, and he is correct in saying \\"F YOU MS. CHENEY, F YOU TIPPER GORE!\\" Eminem will keep rapping to entertain the masses and just to piss off you old white women. <BR>Peace
B000001FVL|5.0|Yes, Virginia, video did kill the radio star.  It happened just a few years before MTV was born, in the UK.  Trevor Horn, the music production star, was just getting started.  He and fellow bandmate from Bruce Wooley's Camera Club, Geoff Downes, formed a synth duo and turned out a bunch of snappy pop tunes about a futuristic, plastic landscape.  Old fan rumor has it that Horn is a fan of Brit sf writer J.G. Ballard, and that the weird lyrical themes are drawn from his writings....<br />Within a few years, the duo did a brief stint for the album \\"DRAMA\\" with YES, the video for \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" would kick off MTV in '81, Horn would start to produce some of the biggest nusic of the 80s (Art of Noise, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Seal), and Downes would hold down keyboard chores for supergroup Asia.  Wow...  \\"Age of Plastic\\" is what they did before they did all that.  See how it all started...

B00003CXE7|3.0|Over the years, it seems that Hollywood has forgotten how to make great Roman era epics. Watching Ridley Scott's award-winning \\"Gladiator\\", it was obvious to me that they still can't remember. <br />\\"Gladiator\\" follows the story of Maximus Decimus Meridus (Russel Crowe), the emperor's new favorite to become his heir. The emperor's son, Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix), is enraged. He kills his father and exiles Maximus, who escapes to find that both his wife and son have been killed. He is found by slave traders, who sell him to gladiator trainer Proximo (Oliver Reed, who died during production*). As he competes in matches in the Colosseum, Maximus's life soon becomes a quest for vengance. <br />This is a brainless action movie posing as a thoughtful one. The fight scenes, when they occur, can either be exhilirating or an incredible bore. The opening sequence in Germania is yawn-inducing, while some of the Colosseum fights, one involving tigers, are quite something (albeit very similar to WWF matches). <br />It is very hard to accept this as a popcorn flick. There's too much campy drama, brought about by a monotonous script. Apparently the writers forgot how to use a thesaurus; the words \\"Rome\\", \\"glory\\", \\"vengance\\" and \\"kill\\" (seemingly) serve as the complete vocabulary for all of Rome. The characters are incredibly flat. Smiles, good humor and anything else that would have lifted the spirits of these dreary characters are nearly nonexistent. <br />The film's visuals are depressingly ugly, with a very limited color pallette. The audience is treated to brown, orange and tan for two and a half hours- the whole thing might have just as well filmed in sepia color tones. The special effects are bland, colorless, and lack detail. People will no doubt be impressed with the digital work to restore the Colosseum, but this feat pales in comparison to other films which have a much richer quality to their visuals- \\"The Phantom Menace\\" or \\"Sleepy Hollow\\", for example. <br />The actingis mediocre. Russel Crowe gives a stable performance, but it does not consist of much more than yelling, grunting and stabbing. Joaquin Pheonix whimpers all the way through his performance, which gets very tiresome and comes off as pathetic. The only real balance comes from Connie Nielsen, who plays Commodus's well-meaning sister. She does well in an otherwise dull ensemble. <br />There is no way \\"Gladiator\\" could have been a great film on the level of \\"Spartacus\\" or \\"Ben Hur\\". However it could have been a fun popcorn movie, had it stuck to being just that. But in the end, poor decisions in art direction, casting, and a deplorable screenplay turn this summer blockbuster into a wannabe of epic proportions. <br />*Fancy editing and computer effects were used to give the illusion of Reed's presence in scenes he did not complete.
B000002UV1|5.0|Mother's Milk is one of the greatest albums of all time. It's better than the Peppers' previous albums and much better than Californication and One Hot Minute. It supplies your body and mind with energy like no other album except of the masterwork, Blood Sugar Sex Magik.<br />Mother's Milk introduces Chad Smith on drums and most important,<BR>John Frusciante's funky guitar work. You can hardly call it work,<BR>it sounds like all the members having the same fun and excitement<BR>like the listeners.<br /> The first 2 songs are exciting, especially the remake of Stevie Wonder's Higher Ground which has a great bass solo. This and the bass on 'Stone Cold Bush' established the legend of the 'funky ass flea bass', you also can hear the genius of flea on 'Taste the pain' where he plays trumpet. 'Knock me down' is the most beautiful and melodic song on this CD but better don't keep it too much in your head cos the lyrics of the chorus really knock you down. That's why I prefer 'Sexy Mexican Maid'. <br />All in all, Mother's Milk is a classic that has only 1 or 2 low points: 'Nobody's weird like me' is overshadowed by the other, much better songs and I can listen to 'Punk rock classic' only 1 time a month. But you shouldn't forget the other 11 tracks that make you wanna go out and improve the world!
B00005JKL8|2.0|\\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" is exactly the kind of film that I will not spare harsh words for. After all, was I not made to sit for two hours watching a work so devoid of passion, truth and entertainment value? The film is predictable down to the very last detail. It is a work processed straight out of the Hollywood Money Making Machine with no touch of humanity anywhere to be found. I think it would be more appropriately titled \\"Run Owen, Run! (Brought to you by Coca-Cola, Chevrolet and Ice Cube.)\\" If you've seen the film you know exactly what I'm talking about.<br />If you must know, the plot involves Owen Wilson as Chris Burnett, a Navy lieutenant running away from his Serbian foes. Gene Hackman is Admiral Reigart, the one trying to pick Burnett up and bring him back home. The trouble is, a peace treaty was recently signed between America and those chasing Burnett, so if Admiral Reigart dares and goes after him, his entire command is at stake. War is a complex subject, and a good war film should never be able to be summarized in three sentences. But this isn't a good war film, and I just did it, didn't I?<br />I probably don't need to tell you how unrealistic this whole affair is. Am I supposed to believe that with an entire section of the Serbian army on his tail, Burnett gets out completely unscathed? Are these guys really such bad shots that out of all of them, not one can even hit Burnett in the leg? With the carelessness Burnett shows, he's pretty damn lucky that Hollywood \\"magic\\" can pull him out of a jam whenever he needs. I say Burnett is careless, let me elaborate. If I were in his position, and had a chance to escape by blending in with the opponent, there is no way I would take off a ski mask that was concealing my identity (even if I did get rewarded by hearing that triumphant music in the background).<br />I am also sick of directors coming into Hollywood, placing a bunch of radical camera tricks in their film and thinking that makes them Orson Welles. POV, 360 degree rotation, Slow-Motion (one of the inventions the film world would be a better place without), lightning-quick montages, it's all here, and ALL the time. Director John Moore never gives it a rest. English should be a required course in film school so directors can forget about the lenses and the camera speeds for at least a minute and focus on the point they're trying to get across.<br />Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman do their worst in this film. Owen Wilson is a generally good actor who somehow lets all his acting skills go to waste and create a completely bland, stupid character. And Gene Hackman? It would be a huge understatement to call him a fantastic actor who's had some classic performances, but he is scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one. I can safely say that this is one of the worst performances of his fruitful career, and I am in shock that such a smart actor as him would choose such an empty project. However, Gene Hackman at his worst is better than Ben Affleck trying his hardest. The one reason \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" is on a level slightly above dreck like \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is because it is graced with his presence.<br />\\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" is the kind of film built to [bring] in money, and maybe grab a few awards along the way.

B0000640VO|4.0|What a fun film! From the moment it begins, \\"Amelie\\" bursts with joy and energy. It's a fable of sorts, a love letter to a Paris fondly dreamt of by many. It may not be the real world, but it is such a delightful fantasy that it doesn't matter how unbelievable some of it may be. \\"Amelie\\" is the rare romantic comedy that has both the romance and the comedy. It isn't very surprising that this has been a hit in France for a while now, and I have no doubt it will find the audience it needs in the States as well. <br />Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) is a naive girl working at the Two Windmills Cafe. When she was a child her mother and teacher was an innocent victim of a suicide gone awry. Amelie stayed with her father until she was old enough to leave and lead a life of her own. One day she finds a small box of treasures behind a tile in her wall, she decides to return it to her owner and become a natural do-gooder. Later on, she catches a man groping for lost photos under a photo booth (Nino Quincampoix, played by Mathieu Kassovitz), and it's love at first sight. She decides to go on a quest to find this man and help anyone she can along the way (including her father and co-workers). <br />I said before that this film was a love letter to Paris, it is also a love letter to Amelie herself. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director and co-screenwriter) conjured the film like a dream, as if Amelie is his dream girl and he is trying to save her and bring her to a happy ending. It's not hard to want everything to work out for her and her friends. Amelie Poulain is the kind of person who you wish was your best friend, your neighbor or your sister. She bounces along with good grace and whimsy living life to its fullest, yet keeping a mischievous grin. She has her own idea of justice that isn't very disagreeable. The tormentors must in turn be tormented; the lifeless must be brought to life. The film is like a non-musical \\"Bells Are Ringing\\", with our heroine bringing so much life to thosearound her but neglecting her wants and needs. <br />After seeing Audrey Tautou as Amelie, I can't possibly imagine anyone else in that role. She embodies Amelie like no one else could, she is a rare find that pulls off the job of breathing life into Amelie in spades. Wait, I take that back. She does not just breathe life into Amelie, Tautou makes her jump off the screen and pull the audience into the story. It would be a crime for her not to get a Best Actress nomination for her role. <br />Magical is the world that Amelie lives in, where photos and lamps come alive to aid her quest, where TV shows are showing nothing but her story. The story this setting surrounds is pretty standard, and presented plainly could have just been another machine-processed romantic comedy. Is it too sappy? No. On the contrary, the film takes quite a few steps to make sure it doesn't become tacky or conventional. The rich, storybook setting and a witty screenplay (asides are taken to deepen our connection each character, little things that each likes and dislikes) make the film all the more a delight to watch. The cinematography, crafted by Bruno Delbonnel, does wonders for \\"Amelie\\". The camera captures the action with an eye of a child in a candy store, beautifully bringing about each shot as a new discovery. <br />With films like \\"The Widow of Saint-Pierre\\", \\"With a Friend Like Harry\\" and box-office hit \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\", French cinema has had quite a year. It's a delight that we round off the year with \\"Amelie\\", a fresh, funny journey that could have easily just been more Meg Ryan-esque romantic comedy fodder. If not for anything else, see it for Tautou's performance, but prepare to be smothered in a dream world.

B00005JKQZ|4.0|On the surface, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is a biopic of John Nash, one of America's great mathematicians. But that statement is misleading. \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is not a film that paints a big, sweeping portrayal of the events of one man' life. Instead, in the way that Ed Harris did last year with \\"Pollock\\", Ron Howard gives the viewer a more personal look at the subject of the film. Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman don't take the easy route and merely dramatize everything that Nash accomplished, for that would really only be a two-hour way of saying \\"Won Nobel Prize for...\\" They let us get to know Nash as only those who were closest to him knew him, and most remarkably show us how his mind processed and who he was. <br />John Nash (Russell Crowe) is a math student studying at Princeton College. His friends are studying and building on the works of what he considers to be \\"lesser mortals\\", while what he really wants to do is come up with a truly original idea. He spends his time alone, trying to find definitive patterns to everyday movements, games, etc. He gets encouragement from his roommate Charles (Paul Bettany), but I'll jump the gun a little and tell you this is where the trouble starts. Suddenly, he does find his original idea, and it is so revolutionary that he is given a grant to study/teach at MIT. There, he meets Alicia, a student of his that he has begun to court. The two get married a while later, but during this time, Alicia doesn't see that Nash is being plagued by delusions, one a CIA operative (Parcher, played by Ed Harris) who enlists him on a \\"top secret mission\\" to try and discover secret encoded messages in periodicals supposedly being sent out by Russian spies. His empty quest starts to devour him, as he dreams of the Russians coming after him and other secret forces closing in. Alicia begins to notice that something is definitely wrong, and starts to help her husband try and realize what is real and what isn't. <br />\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is a solid, powerful drama. I'll re-iterate that it doesn't tell us everything about John Nash, and sometimes that irked me. I admit I did not know much about John Nash's accomplishments, and going out, I wasn't in the least bit enlightened on that front. His supposedly breakthrough work on game theory goes relatively unexplained here, and that was one thing in the film that could have used a little tweaking. However, this is about the man, not the work. Many people have complained about the film's ignorance towards Nash's bisexuality, and I would have to disagree with them to an extent. There are moments in where bisexuality is most definitely hinted at. This would be more of a problem if the film was not so obviously trying to focus on Nash's paranoid schizophrenia, something that is portrayed magnificently. <br />Akiva Goldsman has fashioned his screenplay in such a way that we are put in Nash's shoes, and then brought to see a more objective view. At first, we have little idea as to what Nash's delusions are, they all blend into reality seamlessly. Then, they start to get more outrageous, and when Nash's fears of these images start to be brought out into the public, we start to look at him from another viewpoint. However, we feel for him, because we have seen what he is going through, and we feel for those affected by him (especially Alicia) because he has become so out of touch with the world. <br />This film is a prime example of what Russell Crowe can do when he's not out toga partying with Ridley Scott. He gives one of his best performances, portraying the schizophrenia without over-doing it or milking moments for their dramatic value. Another actor might immediately approach the subject grimly and teary-eyed, but Nash at first cannot realize what he is seeing does not exist, so why should he be afraid? Jennifer Connelly gives the other extraordinary performance in the film. Connelly has been one of the most under-appreciated and hardest working actresses in the business, and it is wonderful that she will now get the recognition she deserves for her powerful, passionate portrayal of Alicia Nash. <br />\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is compelling film that never stoops to endorse melodrama or over-acting. It doesn't get all the details of John Nash's life in, that much is true, but it doesn't need to. It has a purpose, and it executes it in magnificent form. It is a fine, intricately constructed vision of paranoid schizophrenia and a man who had the will to defeat it. And although skeptics will attack it until the cows come home, the truth is that \\"Mind\\" is beautiful.
0671027344|5.0|I like this book. It was so great. I found myself liking Charlie and wanting to be more pensive like him. And I think I have become more analytical about things, which is good.
B00005T30L|5.0|The so-called \\"teen movies\\" offered in recent years have been of a dull and empty variation. The basic formula usually includes the geek who gets the girl/guy, the nasty popular kids, the jocks, the unlikely couple and more uses of the word \\"like\\" than any normal person is able to tolerate. What a rare treat it is that in the middle of the season usually full of teen movie trash that we had \\"Ghost World\\", a film that remembers that not everybody fits into easily accessible categories (adults and teens alike). <br />Thora Birch is Enid, a high school grad unsure of what to do with the rest of her life. She thinks she will rent an apartment with her best friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), but with no job and summer school (for flunking art), nothing is certain. In a similar spot is Seymour (Steve Buschemi), a record collector who can't see any real meaning to his actions. Enid and Rebecca play a seemingly harmless prank on him after seeing a classified ad he put in the paper. Quite to the surprise of the duo, this little stunt really hurts Seymour. Guilty, Enid feels obligated to hook him up with the girl he was looking for in the ad. <br />What is remarkable about \\"Ghost World\\" is not that it is more entertaining than your average teen entertainment. No, what strikes me about \\"Ghost World\\" is how astutely it remembers the feeling of displacement that plagues so many teens. Enid doesn't seem to have many friends who respect her, and as cynical as she may get, human contact is the obvious ingredient missing in her life, even though she is constantly pushing it away. Rebecca urges her to get a job, so she gets a job working at a concession stand in a multiplex. That same day, she's fired for too many wise remarks about the theater and it's customers. Enid doesn't feel the need to \\"fit in\\", instead she sees the whole world collapsing around her and would rather observe and snicker than get away from the problem. She tries to move on with her life, yet everyone around her is trying to keep her grounded. Thora Birch seems more alive as Enid than in any other of her roles. In \\"American Beauty\\", she played a similar character, but I was less than convinced with her portrayal, mostly consisting of pouting. In \\"Ghost World\\", it is like she has woken up, and really works as Enid. Her chemistry with the other actors ranges from comfortable to repellent as the story requires. <br />Seymour is just as miserable as Enid. He collects all kinds of junk- from jazz records to old posters from the fast-food company he works for. He wishes he could have a more rewarding career and a more exciting life. \\"I hate my intrests\\", he remarks. Where Enid is a little more honest and will say anything that comes to her mind, Seymour builds a shield against pain with his collections and obsessions and rarely takes a chance. Enid does not care about the consequences; Seymour is constantly running away from them. Steve Buschemi is wonderful in this role. He does what an actor should as he doesn't overact but really gets into the character and inhabits him. As we watch him, we feel just like a picture Enid draws in her sketchbook: \\"Go Seymour!\\" We want him to get the girl, to succeed and live happily ever after. Unfortunately, his own self-pity comes back to haunt him when he realizes he has nothing in common with the woman of his dreams. <br />In the end, Enid is off to create a world of her own, while Seymour is left behind back where he started. He does have his experiences with Enid, but how far does that really take him? We will never find out, but we are sure that he will start to come into his own; we now have gained confidence in him. The film has that personal touch that most films lack. Coming from Terry Zwigoff, a man who threatened to commit suicide if the subject for a documentary he was making didn't cooperate (\\"Crumb\\"), it's easy to see why the film is so accurate in its portrayal of emotional emptiness. \\"Ghost World\\" has so many strengths to deem it one of the best films of the year. And as much as some would like to disagree, it is not a teen movie in any way, shape or form.
B00005YW4H|5.0|this is just a great cd.  its just fabulous.  this women has such a beautiful and such a unique voice it's mesmerizing.  These are all really great jazzy songs with her playing the piano, also i'm 17 and i love it, and so does my dad so it's really for anybody with good taste in music
B000066C1N|5.0|SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON is a truly amazing, intelligent motion picture, the best yet from DreamWorks and one of the best of all time, animated or not.  Since the filmmakers made the bold choice not to have the animals talk (contrary to most animated features these days), the music had to do more for the film than be an underscore.  It had to carry the film on its shoulders and convey the emotional feel of each scene.  I am pleased to say that it does so perfectly.<br />The score from Hans Zimmer (The Lion King, etc.) is the standout on the CD - vibrant, exciting, rousing, saddening, and happying, it had me cheering Spirit on all throughout the film (and I didn't get thrown out!)  The lyrical songs by Bryan Adams aren't the usual Broadway musical-style songs from Disney, but they work extremely well for DreamWorks in this feature.  &quot;Here I Am&quot; as heard in the movie (track 8 on the CD, not the track 1 single version) is amazing and truly expressive of what the film is while &quot;You Can't Take Me,&quot; &quot;Get Off My Back,&quot; and others also lend to Spirit's tale amazingly well.  They and the other lyrical tunes are not as impressive as the underscore, but they'll have you rocking along in no time and are very fun to listen to and sing along with.<br />My only gripe about the actulal CD release it that the score pieces provided here are obviously abrigements.  I wish the complete score had been issued!<br />All in all, this is a great soundtrack which helps the movie consideably, and I highly suggest you pick it up, fan of the movie or not, for a great listening experience that will lift your spirits.  Enjoy!
B0000640RX|5.0|John Rambo (deity Stallone) has gone through blood, sweat and tears in this untouchable trilogy of a lifetime. In \\"First Blood,\\" the loner just wanted a bite to eat, but a wily, fat cop wouldn't let him. How dare he! The cop then arrests Rambo for not leaving the town. Oh no. After taking some beatings from the cop's goofy partners, Rambo kicks some stern and flees the station. He hides in the woods and cooks some meat. Raw! After defending himself, he goes on a rampage and destroys many stores and finally defeats the cop at his own game. In \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2,\\" Rambo goes back to Vietnam to rescue some prisoners. It was truly remarkable when he fought with explosive bow and arrows. I wouldn't have thought of that. Many explosions and inferno for the whole family to enjoy! I was trembling with excitement when Rambo flew a helicopter all over a village and wreaked havoc. Immortal! Finally, in the epic conclusion \\"Rambo 3,\\" Rambo stick fights a guy who looks like he hadn't taken a shower in a month! Rambo goes to Afghanistan and saves a whole bunch of people from evil legionnaires. My spirit was uplifted when Rambo drove a tank straight into a helicopter. There are many memorable moments in this divine trilogy, but why should I spoil every minute of it? You need to support Sylvester Stallone and always unite yourself within your heart to become a genius just like Stallone. I am worthy!
B00003CXA2|5.0|i absolutely adore this movie.  with every time i watch it, comes more and more tears.  it is incredibley moving.
B00004STDN|5.0|Gabe Walker (Sylvester Stallone) was haunted by a woman falling to her death. Her equipment started to break while she was dangling stories high from the ground. Mountain climbing had never been so difficult and Walker pulled himself toward her to grab her. He caught her as she fell, but her hand started to slip. It was a terrifying moment. When she fell, he was devastated and felt guilty for many years. It wasn't his fault, it was slippage. Well, in present day, John Lithgow (wannabe wiseguy) has dropped millions of dollars into some snowy mountains. He and his group of hooligans try to recover the money and they have the deity and Michael Rooker to help them get it back. Lots of mayhem and avalanches galore! I was amazed with the  ability that Stallone had. Climbing a freezing mountain in only a t-shirt, jumping off of cliffs and swimming underneath some ice. Gargantuan! Stallone vs. Lithgow at the end was a bit pitiful. Why let the 3rd Rock guy even punch you a couple of times? That was nice of you Stallone. Well, Renny Harlin's \\"Cliffhanger\\" does deliver and it won't disappoint any Stallone fan. Icy entertainment!
B000003S09|5.0|This album, released in 1969, basically started the genre known as progressive rock. It's historical significance is enormous, if you are a new prog rock fan and want to trace prog back to its beginnings... It is essential to know your roots if you are a fan of 80's prog rock bands. Give this one a spin.. It is not only the first prog CD ever created, it is ,undoubtedly, one of the finest.
630460288X|5.0|I was astounded by the creativity by this action film. After being cyrogenically frozen since 1996, Los Angeles' most forceful police officer John Spartan and Los Angeles' most ruthless criminal Simon Phoenix, have been brought back for the fight of the galaxy! Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes are dynamite. Phoenix (Snipes) has been brought back to assassinate a homeless rebel leader and Spartan (Stallone) has been brought back to stop the sadistic man. Oh my word! Phoenix learned martial arts and curses up a storm at a bank machine. I know the feeling! But, a censoring program will not allow Phoenix to swear and he gets even more upset. Hostility! The year now is 2032 and San Diego and Los Angeles have been merged as San Angeles. It is a time of peace and 'be well' amongst society. Unfortunately, all of the smiley faces have been introduced to Phoenix and Spartan! Phoenix goes to a museum and gets some artillery. Spartan follows and they fight to the finish. Spartan took time to get used to the 'new' times. He swears plenty, wants to eat meat and doesn't understand Sandra Bullock. The mayor of San Angeles dresses in bedsheets and told Spartan to 'be well' when he was angry. Spartan's response is ultimate and forever will be memorable. You'll have to see it to live it! This movie made me want to go back in time and see it for the first time again. Too bad there weren't any special features on the DVD. But, it's ok, this movie is a masterpiece and was overlooked at every awards ceremony. Rip-roaring entertainment that anybody would love. I saw this movie when I was nine-years-old and I will watch this movie forever.
B000003JA7|5.0|When I first saw this at the music store and looked at the back and saw that it was only two songs and about 21 minutes long each, I figured they would be boring... (this was when I hadn't yet gotten into prog rock...) But, Boy was I wrong. Before I bought this superb 1972 release, I got my feet wet in other prog albums. I bought Pink Floyd's &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (which only contained 5 songs but clocked in at over 45 minutes) among other albums, and realized the key theme to prog.. Progressive rock never stays the same throughout a song. The songs may run continuously throughout an album (SEE Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;) and the mood usually changes many times on one track.<BR>These are some of the wonderful characteristics of progressive rock that many people need to realize
B000050FEN|5.0|Seven is gripping from the beginning to the end. The strength in this film is the very intricate and well developed plot, the excellent casting (including Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann from Full Metal Jacket) and the powerful statement. In every single David Fincher film, he always questions our modern society and the way we function in our every day lives. He makes a bold statement in the movie using the quote towards the end &quot;We accept it because it is common.&quot; The movie really makes you re-think modern society and our station in life. The movie takes place in a dark, cold and overcast urban environment where crime does not seem to be a stranger. There are motifs to many classic books such as Paradise Lost. All actors and actresses did an excellent job, most notably Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset, a retiring  homocide detective who has traditionally been good at his job. The movie screams for attention, and the audience cannot help but obey. The movie left me shocked, amazed and mesmerized. This movie is one of the greatest of its time. It is well directed, well played, and well written. Almost as good as The Usual Suspects.
B000002KKS|5.0|It seems such a shame that i have only enjoyed the cassette ver-<BR>sion of this album.  Already i have had to buy three tapes of this album.

B000002UAU|5.0|The album \\"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" first released on June 1, 1967, is an unquestionable milestone in rock history.  Taking some 700 hours to make, it was a tour de force of music, put together by the lovable lads from Liverpool, George Martin (their brilliant manager), Geoff Emerick (a talented engineer) and a large number of symphonists.  It kicked off the Summer of Love, and, in the words of literati Kenneth Tynan, was \\"a decisive moment in the history of western civilization.\\"  Of course, this is risible now, but the album's place in rock history has been established.  As with most albums, \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" is many things to many people.  In fact, people's opinion of this album can be separated into two categories:  those that love the album and consider it one of rock's best, and those that can't stand the \\"silly, psychedelic [stuff].\\"  Obviously, I fall into the first group, and would think (or at least hope) that most other listeners do as well.  Because I cannot add anything which hasn't already been said, I will leave with this recommendation:  anyone who wants further information about the album, or the Beatles in general, should check out the book \\"A Day in the Life\\" by Mark Hertsgaard, a journalist who was the first outsider (ever) to listen to the archive tapes of the Beatles, locked away in a vault at Abbey Road Studios.  <br />i'd love to turn you on
B00006690F|2.0|this is by far not what i expected, the marshall mathers lp was much better than the eminem show. The marshall mathers lp was more in your face than this record, all of the songs [stink], there is not 1 song that you would want to listen to over and over. The only good thing about this record is the dvd that comes with it. There are way too many skits, and you would think that with everything that is happening in the world, eminem would have something better to rap about than getting std's from women, dissing moby, and petending that he's batman in half the songs

B00003CXV4|5.0|I really liked this movie.  The more you see it, the more it grows on you.   I was surprised that it didn't make me cry the first time I saw it but it does whenever I watch it now because I already know ahead of time what is going to happen and I understand the choices that Sara makes.   I especially liked the 12 days of Christmas.  Nelson went from a totally emotionally unattached (the guy was through having sex with his girlfriend as soon as the alarm clock went off!), unfeeling workaholic to remembering the item \\"that started it all.\\"  I believe Sara pulled it off rehabilitating him back to Earth.   Every time I watch this movie, I see something that comes together that I didn't catch before.  Charlize Theron does a wonderful job as Sara. ... <br />The movie gave me mixed emotions.  I like the ending.  Anyone who has ever had to watch a loved one die would understand Sara's decisions.
1577311523|5.0|Just got through reading \\"The Power of Now\\". I've read all the spiritual classics: \\"I Am That\\", Vivekananda, Yogananda, Adi Da Samraj, Ramana Maharshi, Ram Dass's \\"Be Here Now\\", Shankara and Vedanta, Buddha, all the major religions, Rajneesh/Osho, \\"The Impersonal Life\\", and they are all very good to great but this book is by far one of the most clear and practical. Maybe I was just ready, but the book gives direct and specific instruction for entering \\"THE NOW\\" in plain, modern day, unpretentious language. Some of the other spiitual books, though not all, used either too much indecipherable parable, ancient language, excessive moralizing, or had a non-western view point that made application unclear. I sometimes only got fuzzy, ephemeral glimpses of the here and now. <br />In contrast, this book just hammers you into the here and now like a sledge hammer busting up the deluded mind, the dysfunctional mind, the neurotic mind, the desperate mind, the lost mind, the angry and confused mind, like a boulder dropped into a pond we drop to the bottom of the here and now.<br />At first the plain western looking cover with a white guy on the inside back flap didn't look impressive. It looked like some sort of self help, psychotherapy pap. The author was not from India so what credibility does he have? Every one knows that the East has the metaphysics thing down to a science. Western psychology is just superficial rearranging of neurosis. They have no idea what enlightenment is. Only yogis, swamis or spiritual masters can open the doors to enlightenment. Plus the author said his enlightenment or realization was sudden. He did not appear to have prepared through meditation, but in the midst of a personal crisis this white guy suddenly figures it all out! Come on! But looks are deceiving. This guy knows what he's talking about. Now that I think about it, Ramana Maharshi had a similar unexpected realization of the truth.<br />The author makes no claims to any religious traditionor spiritual, path yet in light of the understanding uncovered in this book, many previously cryptic spiritual parables become clear. There are few examples of this given by the author. <BR> <BR>BE WISE. Don't wait for a disaster to strike to be forced into accepting the here and now. Do it NOW. Read this book again and again until it sinks in. I'm glad there are so many good  reviews. The more people who utilize these teaching the saner our world will be. I'm going to buy the CD to listen to while in the car.
B00005JHAB|1.0|I have got to say that this is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. Come on, the guy manages to rescue her on horseback when her horse runs away with her. The beginning was kind of promising, but as I got to see what an idiot the Jennifer's love interest is I just kept wanting to shout, \\"Stay away from him.\\" It's not like he's a sicko, but he's an idiot. So much sappy stuff happens, such as the aforementioned rescue. He actually rescues her several times. The plot is so predictable anyone could recite the dialogue along with the characters. In short, don't waste your time on this movie
B00005NC66|4.0|You can read the other reviews to hear what a great classic of French New Wave cinema this is.<br />My only complaint with the DVD is the narrow-screen &quot;pan and scan&quot; format, and the sound quality.  The picture quality is very nice but they made this DVD from a VHS restoration, so the sound quality is only so so, with a low hiss permeating the sound track.  I wish they had a letterbox edition!
0783114222|5.0|I love how each episode looks at a part of the Apollo program through a unique perspective.  For instance, the episode about Apollo 13 is from the point of view of the TV reporters covering the story, and attempts to show the differences between old-school and new reporters.  My favorite episodes are &quot;Spider&quot; (about the design, testing and flight of the LM) and &quot;1968&quot; (about the Apollo 8 mission and the first humans to orbit the moon).  If you are interested in the human side of the Apollo program, get this DVD set.
0786915749|3.0|Before reading \\"Dragons of Autumn Twilight\\", I had been told it had a reputation as one of the finest novels based on Dungeons and Dragons ever written, and that it was good enough to stand on it's own as fantasy outside the world of gaming fiction.  Having now read it, I found it was more like revisiting a somewhat well-run D&D game rather than a landmark fantasy epic.<br />Plotwise, the book cruises through a few pivotal weeks in the lives of nine main (and another four or five secondary) characters as they catalyze the greatest war that the planet Krynn has ever seen.  In the nine, you find your typical D&D adventuring gang, some fighters (including a barbarian and a paladin), a rogue, a cleric and a mage.  All we really needed to make this the stereotypical gaming group would be a bard - we've even got the standard backgrounds, romantic entanglements and character conflicts.<br />It's basically fluff, but it's certainly readable.  Having been a former gamer, I found it nice to go back and escape into a D&D world briefly without having to write up a character concept or worry about whether or not I stocked up on trail rations in the last town.  As a fantasy fan, I found it nice to have a good, old-fashioned meat-and-potatoes story of good vs. evil.  However, the Tolkien and George R.R. Martin fan in me wanted a lot more from the characters.  None of them really hit three-dimensionality and only one or two even made it past being total stereotypes.  Even the story was rather straightforward - betrayals and love triangles happened rather than being formed and, in most cases, came completely out of left field.<br />Ultimately, I recommend this book to the fantasy fan looking for something very light to read on the beach during summer vacation or the lonely D&D fan missing his or her group.  If you're looking for something more substantive, though, stick with Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, Robert Jordan or even Terry Pratchett.

B00003CXI1|4.0|The staggering success of J.K. Rowlings' Harry Potter novels put enormous pressures on the producers of the movie version of the first book in a the series, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\". This was the most eagerly anticipated movie based on a book since \\"Gone With the Wind\\" sixty-two years ago. <br />I am happy to report that the movie turns out to be quite good. If it has a problem, it is that it is too slavishly faithful to the book. This prevents the movie from soaring to the great heights a visual medium can reach on its own terms and makes it run a bit too long. Two and one-half hours is a long time for most kids to sit still; however, there are enough sights and thrills here for most of them to tolerate its length happily.<br />For those of you who don't know, Harry Potter [Daniel Radcliffe] is an orphan who lives in the cupboard under the stairs of his uncaring relatives' suburban home. One day he and his guardians are inundated by letters [delivered by owls!] which say that Harry has been accepted into Hogwarts School. This is how Harry finds out that he's a wizard. After much magical persuasion, Harry gets to go to Hogwarts. There, he meets wizards and witches, sorcerers and trolls, and other fantastic creatures. For the first time ever, Harry feels like he's at home. There are a lot of happy, magical moments at the school, but there are also dangerous ones. Among them are a dark wood that students are never to enter, an evil professor, some not-so-nice fellow students, and a demon that wants Harry dead. Harry and his new best friends, Ronald and Hemione [Rupert Grint and Emma Watson], are in for many fantastic adventures. <br />The excellent cast includes some of Britain's best actors, including the legendary Maggie Smith as Minerva and Richard Harris as Demeledore.  Robbie Coltrane is remarkable as Hadrid, the loveable giant who is always doing and saying the wrong things, and so is Alan Rickman as the nasty Professor Snape. Radcliffe, Grint andWatson are gifted young actors and play their characters without the annoying cuteness that is found in many kids' movies. <br />Some of the special effects are amazing, especially the flying Quiddich game sequences and one involving an encounter with a giant chess set that comes to life. Many of the effects don't look lifelike, but, considering the movie's big budget, this may have been done on purpose, in order to give the movie a fantasy, dream-like look. <br />Some of the movie may be too intense for very young children. This has always been a problem with movies, though. When I was five or six, I was totally traumatized by the wicked queen and her poisoned apple in Disney's \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\\". I don't like apples to this day. But, then, I was pretty high on the wimp scale.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|After watching this movie numerous times over the past three years I have owned it, I can say that this movie may contain the best sound versus visuals of any movie to date.  I thougroughly enjoyed &quot;Pi&quot;, so I decided to rent this movie and was blown away.  I have also read Hubert Selby's &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; and loved the rawness it possessed.  The movie and the book it was adapted from really show a side of all humanity that is common among us all.  We all have are vices, some are good and some are bad, but when they are taken to an extreme, the result is usually negative.  Love someone or something too much, you will always be left broken-hearted or dead, respectively.  Much like the X-Files, there usually is some music playing in the background.  I have never seen this technique used to perfection as it is in this movie.  The shots, dialogue, music, etal. are as original as it comes.  I enjoy showing this movie to friends just to see there reaction.  There have only been two responses, they either love it or feel that it is too disturbing.  Nonetheless, this is a truly great, original American movie that offers something of value to every distinct viewer.
B000060P79|5.0|Any one who is interested in any musical scene, would be able to find a great deal of enjoyment from No pads, No helmets...Just balls. the lyrics are awesome and very inspiring, and the sound is to die for. Jeff, Dave, Chuck, Pierre, and Seb are all extremely talented in wat the do...bass, drums, vocals, and guitar. I recommed this cd for anyone who just wants to listen to so kick [butt] music...so get your butt off the couch to either the computer or nearest record store and buy No pads, No Helmets... Just balls!
B00003CXI1|2.0|I've enjoyed every Harry Potter book that has been released so far, however the film adaptation of the first book is very disapointing.  I'll concede that the books certainly weren't wonderful peices of literature, however they did tell an entertaining story and have well crafted characters.  And unfourtunately the movie does neither of these things.  With many crucial scenes being delted (to keep the attention span of young viewers, which is already a stretch at two and a half hours) the story becomes nothing more then a series of plot points, losing many of the charming aspects that made the first Potter book so captivating.  The viewer feels dragged along from scene to scene, missing out on the in depth attention to detail that makes Rowling's writing so immersive.  As a result of this unfourtunate fact, it would be almost impossible for one who has not read the books to get anything out of this film other then a lackluster, mildly confusing, seldom entertaining, child's movie.  Another point of fault is the casting.  It's understandable that eleven year old actors won't be of wonderful quality, however the kids in this movie react in wooden, artificial, ways.  At every scene I could just imagine an acting coach to the side saying &quot;Alright, now try and look amazed, now sad,&quot; etc.  Even the adults in the movie suffer from this affliction.  Characters don't really convey what the books meant for them to, instead being unsatisfying cardboard cut-outs that facilitate special effects and plot points.  Speaking of the effects; they were another disapointing aspect of the production.  None of the CG really seems to mesh for me.  The quiditch match is alright, but there are times when it looks far too blue-screened.  Added to this the child actor's sub-par ability to have emotional responses, and often the CG and the real motion fail to mesh -- it appears as though the actors are simply responding to onstage prompts, and aren't actually a part of the CG.  <br />All of this combines together to form a movie I could barely stand watching.  Despite the fact I enjoyed the books, characters most of all-- I felt a dull apathy for the characters in the film.  Harry especially.  If perhaps only one of the afore mentioned negative points had been present in the movie I would have enjoyed it much more, but all of them together robbed Harry Potter of any enjoyment, turning it into a boring, annoying, lack-luster production.
B00005RY7X|4.0|I live in England and when this cd came out it was awesome.  Party hard was all over the radiostation.  The one thing that i dont understand is that this cd came out in england like 2 months before the states.  anyway it is a must have cd.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I wanted to see this movie ever since I read the book.I loved<BR>the action in it.  One of my favorite parts was the quidich <BR>match.  I had know idea how the game was played.  I would <BR>reconamend this movie to any  one  who is a Harry Potter fan<BR>and beyond.  Good work to all who created this movie, and to<BR>J.K.Rowling for writing such a great book.

B00005QGAV|5.0|All I can see is that this would have to be my favourite album that I have ever bought. It's absolutley beautiful. I bought it today actually because I'd heard what a great CD it was and now that I've bought it I can see what all the fuss is about. I'm paticular about music but this music is a work of Art. I was literally moved to tears when I listened to &quot;Keep the faith&quot;  and &quot;Will you be there?&quot; Jam is a classic right from sadness to raunchy to just heaps of fun. This cd is a work of Art and I have to say inspiring,something which we all need every now and then is real inspiration. My favourites are:... ALL OF THEM! Especially &quot;Give in to me&quot; This man is a real genius GO GET IT!
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down makes some of the bounciest yet best sounding modern rock.  They time signature changes lighting fast, and Serj's vocals can range from a death metal roar to a great choir sound.  The songs each display these characteristics in good ways, resulting in a great disc for rock and metal fans.<br />#1: Prison Song: About politics, prisons, police corruption, and just about everything wrong with the legal system.  For obvious reasons (once you have listened to it) this is the funniest on the cd.  10/10<br />#2: Needles: Very bouncy, and sounds very strange, even for SOAD.  Good song.  8/10<br />#3: Deer Dance: Follows the same subject matter as Prison Song, but in a more serious fashion, and with riot topics thrown in the mix.  Great song.  9/10<br />#4: Jet Pilot: A very fast and short hit, and this one sounds like nothing but noise........   Not so great.  6/10<br />#5: X: Kind of like Jet Pilot, only shorter. 6/10<br />#6: Chop Suey!: The year's weirdest single, and really cool.    <BR>    10/10<br />#7: Bounce: Funny song, confusing, and cool.  10/10<br />#8: Forest: A great song, heavy, and the best on the cd.  10/10<br />#9: ATWA: Doesn't make much sense, but it's ok.  7/10<br />#10: Science: Good song, not much special about it. 8/10<br />#11: Shimmy: The same style as Jet Pilot and X.  7/10<br />#12: Toxicity:  Cool song, about city life and the poison <BR>     of it.  10/10<br />#13: Psycho: Bouncy song about cocaine crazed groupies.  9/10<br />#14: Aerials: Much longer than a typical system song, and <BR>     really cool.  9/10<br />This is a good cd, and modern rock/metal fans will find it very enjoyable.  Classic rock fans, on the other hand, probably won't.  Altogether, it's a good cd, recommended to modern rock fans.
0440219078|5.0|this is the best book i have ever read. Its perfect.You have to read it. You will never forget it.
1559275561|5.0|I first read ZAMM as a sociology class assignment in 1979. I hated it! I wondered why a sociology professor would want us to read this book. I bought the book second-hand, paying $.95 for it. What a DEAL! I still have it, full of my notes from my first reading.<br />In 1987, an interest in Zen caused me to pull the book off the shelf and reread it. I discovered something the second time around...this is a GREAT BOOK.<br />The relationship between the narrator and his son Chris evolves into something wonderful. The author's search for his former identity (pre electro-convulsive shock treatment) is a mystery tale unfolding. And the quest for the meaning of Quality hits home for me in my search for that inner peace that comes from &quot;caring.&quot;<br />You've got to care. Quality is about caring.<br />You can see it at the supermarket when a checker really &quot;cares.&quot; Most of the time, however, you see the uncaring. Ask the checker how he/she is doing, the answer you get is likely, &quot;I'll be doing great when I get off.&quot; There's no heart...there's no caring. And so, Quality of service suffers.<br />ZAMM gives timeless tips on how to get the &quot;caring&quot; back into the things you do. My life has been greatly changed by following some of the tips. It became evident in a statement that came to mind a few months ago... &quot;Work is a state of mind we engage in when we feel we have no other choice.&quot; We always have a choice. It's only work if you don't enjoy what you're doing. The choice is clear...either change what you're doing, or change how you feel about what you're doing.<br />Peace of mind comes with caring about what you're doing. All &quot;work&quot;, every job, in some way or fashion, makes the world a better place. Find meaning in that. Find out how what you do makes the world a better place, and dwell on that contribution, rather than the short-term goal of getting off work.<br />By the way, I'm on my 12th rereading of ZAMM. And every time I read it, I gain some new little insight.<br />Enjoy!time I read it, I gain some new little insight.<br />Enjoy!

6301620208|5.0|This is the single scariest movie I have ever seen.  I am 56 years old and lived through the \\"duck & cover\\" years, the Cuban missile crisis and this movie really brings it all home.  \\"The Day After\\" shows real people from the heartland living through the most horrific experience imaginable-a full nuclear exchange between the US and USSR. Anybody that watches this movie will never consider building a bomb shelter.Who would WANT to survive?
0767817664|5.0|I agree with everyone's assessment of Fright Night. It is,by far, the best vampire movie of all time....it's funny, yet serious and spooky. And isn't overly gory and it doesn't exaggerate on killings. It gives you just enough to satisfy your vampire tastes. And what makes it even more great is that it is a very open-ended movie, by that I mean that although we are shown that Jerry is a vampire, we see his fangs, we see him turn into a bat etc., it is not necessarily set in stone.....could it just be Charley's overactive imagination? And for that matter, Peter Vincent's imagination as well, as he has just ben fired from his long time job and perhaps needs something to make his dull life interesting? The plot is very unique,and it's up to the viewer to decide. And the dance club scene is the stuff of legend.....it simply rocks.Anyone who hasn't yet seen this movie has surely been deprived of top notch entertainment. So if u are tryng to decide whether or not to buy this movie, it's very simple: Buy it!! It should be part of everyone's video library!!
B000002UWF|5.0|More fun than a barrel of hyper New Orleans Italians, Prima and his band--Sam Butera and the Witnesses--rocked Vegas for eight years with his weirdly hyper jazz/R&amp;B interpretations of old standards.  Read the other reviews here...they say it as well as I ever could, and they are all right...funny thing, though, when I was growing up I would see Prima on the Ed Sullivan Show and didn't like him much...I guess we all change our tastes with age...and no, it doesn't matter that most of my reviews are of classical recordings, a great performer is a great performer, and Prima was nuttier than a grocer's case full of fruitcakes!!
0060194995|5.0|Harper Lee writes a wondeful novel that shows us the very best and worst parts of life.
B00005T7HX|2.0|I don't know what the person who wrote this script had in mind, though the central plot of the great British weepy &quot;Goodbye Mr Chips&quot; does spring to mind. Unfortunately the script and the score total undermine this excellent plan.<br />Richard Dreyfuss does his best to make Glenn Holland, the initially reluctant but eventually dedicated teacher, believable - and a very good best it is. But in the end there are too many clichés and not enough that is true-to-life.<br />Above all else there is Mr Holland's &quot;Great American Symphony&quot;. This is a key element of the plot because:<br />- His need to make money whilst he composes his masterpiece is the only reason he becomes a teacher.<BR>- His dream that the finished symphony will enable him to become a full-time composer is what keeps him going whenever things go wrong.<BR>- The final climax of the film centres around Mr Holland's pupils, past and present, getting together one last time to play this masterpiece on the day that Mr Holland is fired from his post.<br />Yet the symphony itself, when we finally get to hear it, is actually brief, vacuous, laughable, and totally unmemorable. If you've been paying attention to the plot you have to wonder how come Mr Holland himself is so unaware of his obvious lack of talent as a composer.<br />The second major fault in the film also appears in the final scenes.<BR>Throughout the film Dreyfuss/Holland has regularly clashed with Vice Principal Wolters (more brilliant character acting, this time by William H. Macy), who regards the music department as a waste of time, space and money.<BR>In the end it is Wolters who informs Holland that, due to budget cuts, the music department is to be closed and that Holland's services are no longer required. When Holland comments on how happy Wolters must be to see him go, Wolters replies:<br />&quot;I care about these kids just as much as you do. And if I'm forced to choose between Mozart and reading and writing and long division, I choose long division.&quot;<br />Sounds level headed, huh? But it ain't. If the script writer had actually known anything about modern teaching then he would have known that there were already a number of reputable studies in existence which show that a regular helping of classical-type music (at least once a week) will actually RAISE all-round academic performance - including in reading, writing and long division.<br />So what do we get? An overly long film (just under 2.5 hours) with a fairly banal plot and an ending which features the triumph of mediocrity - both in teaching methods and in the symphony.<br />I cannot help but imagine what it would have been like with a tighter script, a shorter running time, and an ending where the dawn of a new era of enlightened teaching was welcomed in by a genuinely creative piece of orchestral music.<br />Bottom line: this film is like a damp rocket, all fizz and no fire. So sorry Mr Holland, if I want to watch a positive film about education I think I'll stick with Edward James Olmos in &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;. Apart from anything else it is based on true events - not just a giant helping of schmaltzy fiction.

B00005YTFG|5.0|I love Ewan Mcgregor, I love everything about him. From his toes to his head. I was angered to see that most people didn't like the sound of his voice. Of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I can't understand how anyone would find it &quot;ugly&quot;. <BR>  Nicole Kidman, by the way, is a superb actress. (Being an actress myself, I should know). She seems to be very flexible in her roles. She's played everything from a madwoman, to a cabaret dancer. I enjoyed her singing, also. She has the type of voice, that doesn't knock you off your feet, but is pleasant in it's own way. <BR>  The movie, itself, was amazing. I love Baz Luhrmann's usage of color and music, which you don't see in any ordinary film. It's the type of movie which could be acted on stage just as well. That's the best feature of the film. It's likeness to the stage. Most people can't get out every night and see a real play, so why wouldn't you enjoy this??<BR>  With all these factors combined, I was overwhelmed, astonished, etc., by this brilliant masterpiece of a movie. Ewan Mcgregor, to me, though, was the very essence of this film.

B00003CY5J|3.0|When I heard that Ed Norton, Deniro and Brando were going to make a movie together I was very happy. But I must say that when it came out... Well the performances are very good but the story was predictable and only ok. Its worth watching but not a classic by any means.
0140186395|4.0|Although the novel is full of imagery and situations mimicking the Bible, the book itself does not revolve around these themes.  Instead, the story delves deep into the realm of love, death, and relationships between human beings.  The distinct characteristics that Steinbeck provides in each person set the stage for an excellent novel.  Not only do the characters (such as the moral but foolish Adam Trask, and the evil, sly Cathy Ames) invoke emotion in readers, they also stir the audience to action.  After reading the novel, I wanted to personally do something about the unfortunate situations presented.  <BR> The story starts off describing two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons, across the nation, who later come together via unlikely events.  The great friendships between families last forever, until the manipulative Cathy Ames steps into the mix.  The friendly looking lady seems cheery on the outside, but what is she really like on the inside?  These inner features are what make her a dangerous character, and you need to read the novel to find out what I mean.  In addition, sibling rivalry is represented like the scenes from Cain and Abel, and can be seen through Charles and Adam, and Cal and Aron.  Although both Charles and Cal are inherently evil, Cal is able to use advice from the family servant, Lee, to fend off his immoral ways.  <BR> I recommend this book not for a quick skim, but for a lengthy, indulgent read.  Paying attention to the subtle details that Steinbeck includes calls for increased enjoyment.  East of Eden is a highly entertaining book, while discussing topics that provide stimulation for the mind.
B000067D8W|5.0|That would be great, even though \\"Smallville\\" has just ended its first season. I've seen every single episode of \\"Smallville\\" since Day One, so I can easily say that this was one of the best new series on TV...despite the fact that it's a \\"teen show\\". A lot of critics tried to compare \\"Smallville\\" to \\"Alias\\" and said that \\"Alias\\" was better (later on during the season, after they had already said at the beginning that \\"Smallville\\" would be a great show), but I also saw \\"Alias\\" and I have to say that I enjoyed \\"Smallville\\" a lot more--and I was never even a huge fan of Superman! <br />\\"Smallville\\" is a show about the teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling), living in Smallville, Kansas and who will someday grow up into Superman. But for now, he is trying to fit in with the normal human being life of a teenager...all while trying to win over the girl of his dreams, Lana Lang (formally known as Lois Lang in the Superman comics and movies), played by Kristin Kreuk. Then there's the rich Lex Luther (Michael Rosenbaum), who is friends with Clark but also trying to find out how Clark saved him when he hit Clark while driving and crashed into a river in the Pilot Episode, which you will find on this disc. Lana is also going out with this guy named Whitney (Eric Johnson), who later in the show becomes so-so friends with Clark when they start to trust each other. Clark lives with his parents (played by Annete O'Tool and John Schinder, I think that's how you spell their names) on the Kent Farm and Clark has two best friends, Chloe and Pete. <br />In every episode, you watch Clark Kent save at least one person from the \\"ultimate danger\\". Every episode gets more and more interesting, until you get hooked on the show and can't stop watching it (that's what happened to me!). The entire cast are all very talented, and the screenwriting is excellent. The special effects are also quite amazing, too. And Tom Welling is very hot, and even more hot when he takes his shirt off! So besides thiscast being very talented, there's also some great \\"eye-candy\\", too. <br />As for this disc, it contains the full \\"Pilot\\" episode and the second episode, which is called \\"Metamorphisis\\". It's a Canadian Import so you can only buy it from Amazon.com, but if you love the show then it'll be well-worth it. I hope this means that \\"Smallville\\" will get \\"complete seasons of\\" DVD box sets, but they'll be released here in the United States, too. I can't wait for next season because \\"Smallville\\" is the best new show on TV. If you haven't seen it yet then you are seriously missing out! I highly recommend this DVD to all fans of the show and to those who didn't catch the show but would like to try it to see if it's your cup of tea. But trust me...all the better episodes come on later during the season, so don't just judge by the first two episodes!
0142000655|3.0|East of Eden, written by John Steinbeck, takes the reader back to the early 1900's, when horses were being replaced by automobiles and California still had open, fertile land for beans. The competitive relationship between twin brothers follows the story of \\"Cain and Abel\\", but is easily followed by a reader who is not Christian. <BR>  I recomend this book for the teenage readers. Although filled with numerous chapters, the book reads easily. With an intricate plot and characters whose secrets are slowly unraveled, Steinbeck creates a novel full of characters with complex emotions, motives and relationships. Although rarely a dull moment exists for the Trask family and their companions, the book encompasses so many characters that it takes some getting used to Steinbeck's ever-changing focus in the chapters. The book often introduces an under-developed character who dies, unfortunately, directly after the reader has formed an attachment to him. <BR>  I would not say that this book should become a part of your permanent library, but it deserves consideration. John Steinbeck is a creative writer and easily displays this in East of Eden.

B00000AFGM|5.0|This is by far Marilyn Manson's most depressing album ever. If you enjoy Manson's fast and intense songs, you probably won't enjoy this album. It is filled with slow, gloomy songs. The era of MA (Mechanical Animals) is probably most of the Marilyn Manson fans favorite era though (from what I've learned at MarilynManson.com's BBS). This album is Manson's most metiphoric album by far, with more hidden messages then ACSS (Anti Christ Super Star).

B00005JKED|4.0|I liked Training Day. I have always liked Denzel and been luke warm to Ethan Hawke. But I must say for this roll he is perfect. Denzel is also very very good. The story is a good one but I felt like they did the standard Hollywood feel good cop out in the end. Also, though I usually like Scott Glenn, I personally found him to be miscast. Suprised to see Tom Berenger show up too, though he was very good in his small roll.
0425170349|4.0|When I finished this book for the first time I was ready to give it 5 stars. But 5 stars is probably too much.<br />This book excels in its action scenes. There is nothing else I liked more about this book than reading each encounter with a terrorist threat and how they used psychology, negotiation, and planning to clear a room full of terrorists in as little as 10 seconds.<br />The visuals he gets into your head are amazingly true to life but not enough to make you turn away in disgust. As is usual with all Clancy novels, there are brief, but constant reminders of the sex lives of all of his main characters.<br />Like many other readers, I was also let down a bit by the ending. But if you can appreciate the super-secret nature of the counter-terrorist organization and if you can for just a few moments imagine the terrorists as being truly evil, then you will be better able to enjoy this book.<br />Unlike his newer novels, Clancy remains more true and fair to politics in this novel. He does not ramble on about his views. Instead he focuses a lot more on the ideology of terrorists, which I loved reading. It's basically the way that hostage rescue teams classify terrorists and calculate what their best course of action is, and it is compelling to read just to be informed.<br />There's really no way you can not be drawn into the action scenes in this book. This is what he excels at. The vivid descriptions of military ops and personnel will definitely be easy to visualize and follow, but be prepared for several moments in between the action where things slow down a lot. You may also be a bit confused about the constant changing of points of view. It will switch from John Clark (one of the main characters) to the terrorists to some strange people you've never read about until 200 pages into the book, and will swing around yet again. I had to go back and read several parts over again just to make sense of things that happened later on in the book. There's also a little bit of humor if you'll allow that. The Russian character in this book is as usual depicted in almost a comical fashion of clumsy cold war spies and people who will shift loyalties at a moment's notice.
B000002WPI|5.0|I caught a glimpse of the truest hip-hop album of the 90's when I was 9.  My older brother purchased the cassette of 36 Chambers and had me listen to it a few days later.  I have come back to it ever since.  When the current well runs dry and hip-hop dies in the mainstream politics of selling records, I find myself reentering the 36 chambers for pure genius and intellect. The phenomenal beats, machine-gun lyrics, and martial arts sound effects are crisp clean air in a industry of pollution.  If you have never entered these chambers I suggest you rethink your hip-hop library.

B00005RYL9|3.0|I liked this movie when I was 16. Sean Connery was great (still is the best part of this movie). It had an interesting concept for the time and I was...16. I watch it now and think its ok. I would have given it a 5 stars back then now I find it difficult to give it a 3. Maybe its because back then Christopher Lambert was a rising star and not the straight to video poor actor he has become. The appearance of the Fabulous Freebirds and the Queen soundtrack are really good.
B000068IEU|5.0|This film is gross. It's revolting. It's crude. It's one of the coolest flicks I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. Two lil girls go out to a concert and end up getting kidnapped by a gang of escaped convicts who take them into the woods and have a little over-the-top fun with them, taunting them, humiliating them, violating them, and finally killing them. It's too bad the parents find out about it, because they soon plot revenge. MGM finally will be releasing the most complete version of LHOTL on earth. ...
B000002B7U|5.0|Of course The Ultimate Sin is not as great as No More Tears or Diary of a Madman, but it is still very impressive.  If everyone would stop comparing it to Ozzy's other solo albums, they would realize that too.  The solos are very good, and Jake Lee is a good guitarist, but not the best(that would have to be Zakk Wylde).  Songs like the title track, \\"never know why\\", \\"fool like you\\", and \\"shot in the dark\\"(my all time favorite Ozzy song)are those type of songs you just never get tired of.  Don't listen to everyone else- buy this- you wont regret it.

B000021YQV|3.0|The introduction explains it all. Serji still has the heavy metal spunk that makes him awesome. With the others they make some good music. Most of the songs are too heavy and freaky for me. Nonetheless, songs like &quot;Toxicity&quot; are quite good keeping the song slow and soft with some alternative rock. I got the cd, but the song &quot;Science&quot; got messed up so I missed out on a song.

B00005JKHP|3.0|I loved the film in the theater. The new director's changes weren't noticable, &amp; the time &amp; money would have been better spent on making a good quality transfer to DVD. The detail &amp; image quality is worse than about 75% of my DVDs. There's no excuse for a big company like that putting out such a poor quality disc (but Disney &amp; Fox do it all the time too). Did they think we'd all be viewing the DVD on a 12&quot; black &amp; white TV &amp; not notice? Get with the program, it's the 21st century, most of us have big TVs now. My screen is 8 feet wide. If you got widescreen home theater, you'll be disappointed.

Though their demos (&quot;My December&quot;, &quot;Step Up&quot;, &quot;High Voltage&quot;, &quot;Carosuel&quot;, etc.)are so much better, this cd is good for just chilling. I would recommend Dry Cell instead.

It is like Fools Overture,just more pace and a little more trippy.Cannonball is nice and bouncy(8min.)No Inbetween 5 min.is a beuatiful, mainly piano ballad<BR>which is 30 mins.of exellent music here.Better Days is not bad<BR>either,so this is not a total waste you see.Ok.
B000002UDB|5.0|Magical Mistery Tour in my opinion was the second part of Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.This album have rockers, rockers and more rockers.The result was wonderful.&quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; are my favorite songs but i loved &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, a massive hit.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I loved the film in the theater. The new director's changes weren't noticable, &amp; the time &amp; money would have been better spent on making a good quality transfer to DVD. The detail &amp; image quality is worse than about 75% of my DVDs. There's no excuse for a big company like that putting out such a poor quality disc (but Disney &amp; Fox do it all the time too). Did they think we'd all be viewing the DVD on a 12&quot; black &amp; white TV &amp; not notice? Get with the program, it's the 21st century, most of us have big TVs now. My screen is 8 feet wide. If you got widescreen home theater, you'll be disappointed.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|any of you people who say that this movue is not hilarious must be taking crazy pills. this is the funniest movie i have seen in a long time. watch it you'll love it.
6303314015|5.0|To me, this was the last Disney production that was excellent.  The animation is astounding and the plot keeps you watching.  Im 15 years old and i still watch it.  The music is stirring and the emotions of the movie almost move me to tears every time i see it (you cant help feeling incredibly sad when Mufasa dies).  The bottom line is, if you havent seen this movie, no matter what your age, see it. Then see it again and again.

B00003CXFG|4.0|Science Fiction (and horror, for that matter) films are so numerous that their stories have been copied, remade, expanded upon, narrowed down so much that there is hardly an original idea still floating around in this genre.  \\"Pitch Black\\" does little to change that fact.  The concept of a rogue alien species endangering and eliminating human life is hardly a new one.  The Alien Trilogy provides the seminal work for this type of story and several dozen other movies have tried to copy that formula to varying degress (mostly lesser) of success.  \\"Pitch Black\\" manages to avoid the pitfalls of the path already paved in its approach to re-telling a similar story.  A transport ship carrying 40 commercial passengers (and 1 maximum security prisoner) encounter a meteor storm that forces a crash landing on a barren planet seemingly devoid of life, leaving only about a dozen of the passengers still alive.  The initial trick is in making the viewer think that the now escaped prisoner, Riddick, (played with remarkable style and depth by Vin Diesel) is the true threat to the survival of the rest of the passengers.  The real danger isn't Riddick, but a species of carnivorous, raptor-like animals (seemingly inspired by the species in Aliens) indigenous to this planet.  Initially, these animals are not much of a threat as they are deathly afraid of light (which scalds them) and this planet is privy to three (!) suns.  However, in an unexpected twist of bad luck, the survivors find out that they are about the experience an event that occurs only once every 22 years on this world... a total solar eclipse of all three suns.  Once the eclipse starts, these creatures are free to roam the surface of the planet and devour whatever prey they may find (humans, in this case).  The goal of the survivors becomes trying to transport energy cells from the crashed ship to an intact escape ship left behind by the previous set of unlucky souls from 22 years earlier.<br />With the interesting twistsin its premise, this movie would still not be much more than sci-fi rehash with a gimmick if it were not for the stellar performances put in by an underrated cast.  Diesel is the most noteworthy as convicted murder Riddick.  This role practically sets itself up for a mail-it-in performance of detached coolness.  Yet, Diesel brings surprising pathos to Riddick that enables the viewer to empathize with his struggle to do whats right for Riddick (because, he is a criminal after all) or do whats right for the survivors (because he is human at the core).  One scene early in the movie demonstrates this range perfectly.  Johns, the mercenary cop who tracked down and captures Riddick, taunts Riddick while making a deal the ensure his cooperation and assistance in trying to get the survivors off-planet.  To drive home the point that Johns is definitely in control, he quickly points and fires his rifle at Riddick, intentionally missing him by a few inches telling him, \\"Now I want you to remember this moment, as a way things could have gone, but didn't\\".  Johns, gets a little too close to Riddick after this and gets surprised when Riddick, now unrestrained by the cords holding him at bay, grabs the rifle from Johns, quickly flips around in his face and screams at him \\"Now you remember THIS moment!\\".  While it would be easy to display over the top rage or unnatural coolness during this turn of events, Diesel's facial features betray a sense of frustration and fear in knowing very well that Johns could have killed him and that he does indeed control Riddick.  <br />Vin Diesel is a relatively new actor who first came to audiences' attentions playing Private Caparzo in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  He has such a prescence that watching him on-screen is truly compelling, from roles like a shady stock broker in \\"Boiler Room\\" to science fiction a**-kicker in \\"Pitch Black\\".  Diesel's Riddick makes some of the characters played by Schwarzenegger and Stallone look like Little Lord Fauntleroy.  Diesel could own Hollywood before it's all said and done.  Cole Houser adds strength in the role of the merc cop Johns.  Johns is seems focused primarily on greed (Riddick is a large payday to him) and his next drug hit.  He is so cold and calculating that by far exceeds Riddick as the most dangerous human.  Radha Mitchell as the ships surviving crew member and Keith David as an Arab holy man also turn in effective performances in the struggle to survive this alien world.  <br />While certainly not an original story, \\"Pitch Black\\" takes familiar plot elements and weaves them together into a re-telling that is refreshing and captivating.
B00003CXXO|3.0|I saw Artificial Intelligence about a month ago, and I'm still wondering what the whole point was supposed to be.  To create a robot-boy that can love unconditionally is a wonderful idea, especially for a family such as the one portrayed in this movie.  The obvious problem with this idea is that human beings do NOT love unconditionally.  This means trouble for a robot that can also feel emotional pain and suffering.  I think the very beginning of this movie is the most intriguing part of the film.  I'm referring to the scene in the large conference room where the seemingly brash and pretentious creator of David is explaining what they have accomplished.  If I remember correctly, near the end of the scene, someone in the room poses a question something like, \\"This robot will love it's family, but what obligation does the family have to love it back?\\"  I think the creator-guy just smiles at the questioner and says nothing.  Probably the greatest introduction to a movie I have ever seen.  Well done. My question is this.  Why didn't the creators of David simply take away the robot's immense need to feel a reciprocation of love?  Why create a robot that can feel BOTH love and sadness?Hasn't everyone asked this very question to our own Creator at some point?  Why do we have the ability to do/feel/decide/act anything but what we know to be right and good?  Why do we have a free will?  That's the basic struggle of human existence.  Have we not learned ANYTHING?  I don't know, maybe the whole point of the movie is that we haven't learned anything, and that all the imperfections our Creator passed on to us will in turn be passed on to our creations.  Maybe our Creator ceased to exist long ago, as the movie seems to hint at in the very end.  Maybe we are alone.  Pretty bleak.  Pretty depressing.   By the way, those were robots at the end, NOT aliens.
B00000J6AG|1.0|At  first  I  kinda  liked  the  album  although  it  wasn't  much  to  listen  to . After  a  few  more  listens  it  just  fell  apart . Added  to  this  was  that  the  feeling  you  had  heard  all  the  songs  before  and  by  now  it  had  really  begun  to  grate  on  your  nerves . It  has  the  feeling  of  one  song  been  sped  up  and  slowed  down  and  there  are  incidental  words  just  thrown  across  it  every  now  and  then  without  thinking  of  the  consequences . If  you  are  a  pop  loving  soul , then  by  all  means  buy  this  album ( if  you  haven't  got  it  already ). If  like  Eminem ( which  I  also  don't  like  but  I  think  he's  got  a  point  with  Moby ) then  just  don't  listen  to  this . If  you  are  looking  for  some  really  nice  ambient  dance  music  may  I  suggest  The  Orb  or  Boards  Of  Canada . They  make  music  with  a  lot  more  imagination  than  you'll  hear  from  this  pile  of  waste

B000056V73|4.0|Cameron Crowe wrote and directed this movie (which is semi-autobiographical) about a precocious teen ready to boldly brave the waters of rock jounalism,if only he could get backstage to interview the almost famous band, Stillwater, for Rolling Stone magazine.  This is the story of William Miller, baby-faced, honest to a fault, and anxious to try his new wings, even though his teacher mom is so fiercly trying to protect him from the one thing that William is so eager to interview: Rock stars.  Well written, directed and acted, with lovable charactors such as Penny Lane, Russel Hammond, and Lester Bangs, this is one movie that I didn't want to end. The music is great, too. You'll love it!
B0000072KY|5.0|...Now I'm bored and old. The begining to Nirvana's last album, and in many a true fan's opinion,mine included, their greatest.It may not be the Rock solid, all the way through listen \\"Nevermind\\" is, but these songs are amazing as what they are. This is Kurt letting the emotion flow, and doing it with amazing talent from all involved.<br />The album begins with the heavy and thoughtful \\"Serve the Servents\\" ,songs emotional, and beautiful, like \\"Heart Shaped Box\\", \\"Frances Farmer will Have her Revenge...\\" then my favorite, the amazing and haunting \\"Dumb\\". There are tracks not so great (Scntless Apprentice and the UK version's tacked on track, \\"\\"gallons of rubbing alcohhol flow through the strip,\\" come to mind) and even a dud or (those with adversion to feedback would be well advised to avoid \\"tourettes\\")<br />but the the good outweighs the bad, no contest (if it doesn't why did I give it five stars?).<br />Bottom line:If you want to hear a talented group of people letting their emotions flow into awesome music get this.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Two of my co-workers talked me into reading the Harry Potter books.  From the first three paragraphs in the first book, I was hooked.  At first I was a bit embarrassed about being so caught up in what was supposedly a children's book, but I quickly learned that Harry Potter is for young and old alike.  In fact, I have talked to many adults who have read this series of books and are anxiously awaiting the next (me included).  I was very curious to see if the movie would follow the book and it does.  Obviously they had to condense the book or else the movie would be hours long.  But the screen writers did an admirable job and this movie absolutely lives up to the hype!<br />The movie is 2½ hours long but it will have you spellbound the whole way through.  The actors are superb and the special effects are outstanding.  It's rated PG for `scary moments and mild language.'  I believe that only very young children might be frightened by a few of the scenes, they just aren't that bad.  One scene, as an example, shows a dead unicorn with the villain, Voldemort, bent over the unicorn's neck, drinking it's blood.  Voldemort has to do this in order to continue his evil existence.  There is no closeup, nothing graphic, no gore in this scene; it was done as mildly as possible.  The director gets the point across without the `blood and guts.'  It is also stressed about what an evil and cowardly act it is to kill an innocent animal and that the person who does it must pay the price.  Still, you do see a dead unicorn with the knowledge that the bad guy killed it.  A very young child may have difficulties with it.  As for the language, it is very mild, nothing to worry about.<br />I have heard about many people wanting the Harry Potter books and movie banned because they say it's about witchcraft and the dark arts.  Harry Potter is indeed a wizard, as are his friends, Hermione and Ron.  But the books and movie stress that wizards only use their special powers for good, not evil, intentions.  The power of love, strong moral values, courage to stand up for your convictions, the value of friendship, sports etiquette, and perseverance are some things that J.K. Rowling addresses in her books.  In Harry Potter's world, good always conquers evil.<br />I recommend the DVD version of Harry Potter because of the added features of the 2nd disc.  I tried it on my computer and did enjoy the tours and game that were included.  I have not been able to view the never-before-seen-footage however.  They should have made that more accessible.

0140186395|5.0|John Steinbeck's East of Eden is a captivating novel that uses many interesting devices that make it one of the classics of literature. The text is sophisticated and descriptive without being overburdened by wordiness. The author's tone, message, and intent are clearly conveyed through the simple, easy-to-understand words so there is less room for misinterpretation. The plot continues to evolve throughout the book as interesting characters are intertwined in this story of love vs. hate, good vs. evil, and reality vs. dreams. Even though he uses such common cliches as his main themes, Steinbeck effectively depicts each point through two generations of two different families--the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The characters are so diverse that every reader can feel a common relation or similarity. Set in California at the time period between the Civil War and WWII, Steinbeck depicted the American's typical values or beliefs pertaining to home and to war at the time. This book is also known for its biblical parallel of Cain and Abel to the Trask brothers in the age-old story of sibling rivalry. Neither an unrealistic fantasy where all goes well nor a depressing account on the bleakness of life, the East of Eden offers a balance which tries to the depict the many sides of life without giving it a false generalization.
B000056NX5|1.0|So this is what our Moulin Rouge culture has done to us. In order for musicals to be entertaining, they must have all of the following: hard-rock scores, overly dramatic expressions, bright costumes (all leather, just so people can pay attention to the characters), gyrating hips, and thongs. We must have thongs in order to sit through these musicals.<br />As a Jesus Christ Superstar fan, this version was a huge disappointment. However, I've never seen the play performed, and frankly, I don't want to. There isn't a stage director who can pull off a decent production of this dated play. So if you can't make it good, make it cool to the majority of the idiots who watch movies. <br />As soon as the movie started, I was disappointed. I don't want to see it in a modern-day setting. I don't like the modern score. I want to see hippies prancing around in the desert, dammit! I grew up listening to the original concept recording and saw the Norman Jewison film many times. That's what I want to see! I don't want to see Roman guards who are dressed like comic book villians. I don't want the high priests to look like aliens. I don't want the \\"Pilate's Dream\\" scene to look like porn! WHY?!<br />In addition to the poor \\"modern\\" adaptation, this version is plagued with horrific acting. Renee Castle is pretty good...she could carry the whole production. Jerome Pradon as Judas is crap. His portrayal of Judas as Jerusalem's bully is ridiculous, overdramatic, and unconvincing. However, when he begins to sing, he seems whiney. I kept trying to figure out what he was attempting to do; when he performed \\"Damned For All Time,\\" he kept running all over the place, and I kept thinking, \\"Why???\\"<br />Caiaphas kept looking like Mr. T to me, and I was expecting him to sing, \\"I pity the fool who loves Jesus!\\" at any time. His group of high priests walked around looking like some kind of gang. The actor who played Pilate looked like he only got the part because he can sing and has played villians.He makes you wonder how such an evil looking person came into power in the first place.<br />The apostles all dressed in Abercrombie-like clothes and acted so happy and joyful around each other. \\"Hey, it's Jesus. Let's all hug each other and smile and honor him now.\\" It did seem logical during the Last Supper like all of Jesus's words were way over their heads. <br />When the comic relief (the intended comic relief, at least) finally comes in as Herod, played by Drop Dead Fred himself (Rik Mayall). It could have been a good sequence if Mayall acting completely off-base with his audio...is it that hard to lip sync to your own voice? <br />\\"Could We Start Again Please,\\" my favorite song, also could have been a good sequence, if it wasn't mixed with a beating of Jesus. It wasn't upsetting at all...it was too dramatic and filled with slow motion shots of Jesus being thrown around between a group of what looked like stormtroopers. <br />When the time for \\"Supestar\\" to be performed, I was so ready for it to be over. And it looked like a cross between a really bad music video and a Victoria's Secret commercial. I think it was supposed to be disturbing, but wasn't effective at all.<br />And then Jesus was crucified, and it was again trying to be shocking and disturbing. It could have been, if all of the actors weren't stretching their faces in \\"grief\\". Overall, the actors looked like they had just left an acting workshop and wanted to try out their new methods. If this is the type of acting they teach, it's surprising there isn't more worthless crap floating around out there. If you're interesting in seeing a good version of the play, see the Norman Jewison film. It might be cheesy and dated, but at least it isn't horrific filth.
630587493X|4.0|Similar to \\"Artificial Intelligence,\\" this movie is about the possibility of man creating a new form of life.  Robots are mass produced, which somewhat resemble humans, and are meant to serve some purpose.  In the case of Andrew, his purpose was to be a butler to a family.  It turned out that he became a member of the family, being treated more and more like a human than a machine as he evolved.  His owner realized that he had feelings and thoughts that none of the other robots had.  So he allowed the robot to read books and that began his journey.  He learned how to make crafts, and that's what he did in his spare time.  He eventually earned a very high income and his owner let him keep the money for himself, even opening a bank account for him.  He gets modifications done, first to allow his face to express the feelings he feels, and eventually getting a nervous system, artificial organs, skin, and a human face.  He desires freedom and his owner eventually gives him that- he builds his own house and supports himself.  He eventually falls in love with the decendant of his original owner's daughter (he lives to be 200 years old hence the title).  They want to get married but the law won't allow her to marry a \\"robot.\\"  So he completes his evolution to the point where he is considered human by congress.  He pleaded before them saying that just because he has artificial organs does not disqualify him from being human because many humans have artificial organs that he himself invented.  It seems that the final requirement of congress for him to be considered human, and thus legally able to marry another human, is that his body age and eventually die.  So he \\"acheives\\" this.<br />I guess the movie was supposed to be inspiring how the robot wants so badly to become more and more human.  But basically he had all the attributes of humans only more-- he had greater intelligence, memory, and calculating abilities, he did not require sleep or food, he could never age or die,he was capable of self-maintenence, etc.  I could understand him wanting upgrades but not wanting to downgrade from posthuman to human.  He could have lived with her just the same only without being legally married.  <br />In this movie, the robot is benign to humans.  However, if man did ever create artificial intelligence like this, a being that could think and feel on its own, it wouldn't necessarily be so nice to us.  And by its more advanced nature it could potentially break free from our control.  I think robots and machines should be advanced, but not given feelings.  They are supposed to be our servants, not our family.  We already know how to create people, but machines are supposed to serve us and if they were given feelings it would start to become unethical to make them work for us.  Also, if the robot could evolve towards being human, wouldn't it be likely then that humans could evolve towards being robotic?  They could keep the human attributes they want while taking on desirable robot features.  Imagine how much more fun and productivity we could get out of life by not requiring sleep.  Imagine how much faster we could learn if we could implant a computer chip into our brain.  Imagine being able to live through two centuries-- or longer.  If we ever decided we didn't want to live any longer, like the robot, we could end our existence at any time.<br />Like \\"Artificial Intelligence,\\" this movie attempts to bring about the issues that will face us in the future-- rapidly escalating technology, posthumanism, robots/ computers that could potentially become humans, etc.  However, I think both movies do a poor job of effectively presenting the issues.  They really only introduce the concepts and nothing more.  If you want to learn more, just do an internet search of \\"transhumanism\\" or \\"posthumanism.\\"  I liked Bicentenial Man better than AI because its funny.  That robot really was cute and funny at times like in its reaction to when its owner explained sexto him, or how it gives people insults unknowingly, etc.

He explains that \\"O'Blivion\\" is not the name he was born with, that it's his \\"television name,\\" then goes on to predict that \\"soon, we will all have \\"special names.\\" <br />Now, 17 years later, how many of us are now divided into cubicles, staring at a screen, using our \\"special names\\"? Of course \\"Mr Pants\\" is not my real name, it's my internet name ...<br />Had Cronenberg been able to forsee the advent of the Web, he could have made some very interesting insights about it with Videodrome. But in some ways I think I appreciate it more without its connections. Its dated aspects only serve to make it seem all the more prophetic.
B00003CXI1|4.0|The deleted scenes DO exsist, on disc two. It is hard to get to them, you have to work your way trough the 'game' of the second disc, starting on Diagon Alley, getting your wizard money at Gringotts and then your wand at ollivanders, then going to the classrooms and starting in Transfigureation, go to the stand with the owls on it. It will take a bit of time to figure it all out but you can finally see the deleted scense, you basically play through the book. I am dissappointed by this, as it took me a long time to figure it out. This doesn't dampen my spirits though, the movie is still `number one, though it cut out some minor thingsfor the sake of time. Overall it's a great buy, if you have kids, if not, still worth it to keep the movie forever, since DVD's, unlike VHS tapes, don't wear out, only break.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|When my nineteen year old son suggested that we watch Shrek, I only grudgingly agreed, especially as he had already seen it. Still, how often can one get a teenager to do anything with his mother? So, we hunkered down to watch the film, and am I ever glad that I did. It was absolutely hilarious! This totally irreverent film pokes fun at many fairytale icons. Based upon the book of the same name by William Steig, this is a no holds barred, fractured fairytale, laden with humor, superlative animation, a great script, and a surprising ending. What more can a film lover ask for? It is simply a fabulous film that is sure to appeal to young and old alike.<br />Shrek (Mike Myers) is a giant, green ogre, who is definitely not a candidate for Mr. America. He lives a solitairy, sterile, and lonely life in a swamp. One day, his whole world is turned up side down. When the diminutive and evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) decides to evict all fairytale characters from their homes, the homeless begin squatting in Shrek's swamp, and Shrek is outraged. After making the acquaintance of a loudmouthed, infectiously funny, talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has muscled in on Shrek's swamp, an outraged Shrek pays Lord Farquaad a visit, demanding answers about the influx of the homeless in his swamp. What happens at their meeting results in Shrek agreeing to rescue a Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon's den and bring her to the ambitious Lord Farquaad, so that he may make her his bride. In return for a successful rescue, Shrek will once again be allowed to reign supreme in his swamp.<br />The adventures that the donkey and Shrek have in their determination to fulfill their quest are fun filled and funny. Shrek, who speaks with a soft Scottish burr, is an ogre whose size and fearsome demeanor is belied by his tender heart. Mike Myers infuses this gentle, green giant with a tenderness that makes the viewer fall in love with Shrek. The donkey is brash as only Eddie Murphy can be, totally irreverent and outrageously funny. John Lithgow is wickedly droll, as the size conscious, power hungry, scheming Lord Farquaad. Cameron Diaz, who probably had the toughest role of all, is fine as the fiercely independent Princess Fiona. As Ms. Diaz does not, however, have a distinctive voice, her characterization pales alongside that of the other characters and is the weakest link in this otherwise sensational movie. The film has a surprise ending that is utterly charming and novel. It is an appropriate one for this unique and fiendishly clever film. Shrek is simply a great movie, animated or otherwise. Bravo!<br />This two disc DVD is loaded with eleven hours of bonus features that will provide fun for the whole family. It allows one to record one's voice over that of one's favorite characters' lines and star in one of twelve entire scenes. It also provides over fifteen interactive games. It features music videos, as well as the more traditional filmmakers' commentary and the always funny technical goofs. These are just some of the special featured provided. The quality of picture and sound is, of course, superlative, as to be expected in a first class DVD. This is a value laden DVD, and one that is well worth having in one's personal collection.tally irreverent and outrageously funny.

0142000655|5.0|East of Eden is not just a retelling of the biblical story of Cain and Abel.  The story of two generations of brothers and their relationships is ultimately (at least in my interpretation) about human weakness as well as the strength that derives from the power of choice.  Of course, there are many other themes that are prevalent throughout the entire novel, such as ancestry, love, jealousy, identity, redemption, and good versus evil.<br />Although the story traces the Trask family from Cyrus's sons, Adam and Charles, to Adam's twins, Cal and Aron, the message of novel culminates in Cal.  The offspring of an inauspicious union, it is in Cal that the forces of good and evil battle.  However, he does not only represent the fight between good and evil; he also demonstrates the choice that humans have, the choice that makes us human, timshel - \\"thou mayest,\\" and proves that every man's destiny is not a result of what he is born as, but rather what he chooses to be.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Oh wow! \\"Spider-Man\\" is here! Yahoo! A movie I have been waiting to see for a long time- And I couldn't have asked for more! Tobey Maguire is excellent as Peter Parker, a ordinary teenage boy who only dreams of winning the heart and admiration of the lovely Mary Jane Watson (Who is wonderfully portrayed by Kristen Dunst), his next-door neighbor. While on a field trip to a science lab, Peter is accidentally bitten by an genetically altered (Or is it  radioactive?) spider-and gives our protagonist the ability of a spider! It is enjoyable when we watch Peter discover and develop his special abilities. When his beloved Uncle Ben (Who, with May Parker, had raised Peter since he was orphaned as a child.) is killed, Peter learns that \\"with great power, comes great responsibility\\" and promised himself  to fight crime as the amazing Spider-Man! The movie is entertaining to watch because the storyline is well written-it is original, creative, and they don't tend to copy from anything. I like when the story has original elements (Unless it is based on a book.). The actors were well chosen. Spidey's web-slinging looked so real-I loved the special effects. The action scenes were awesome, but what I liked most about the movie-had to be Tobey Maguire's performance. No one could have done it any better! One of the things I didn't like-was the Green Goblin's costume. Hello?! It looks like something that came out of the \\"Power Rangers\\". But that wasn't so important. I enjoyed the movie-and I await the sequel and the DVD release with great anticipation! Arachnophobics beware! Here comes the Spider-Man!
0142000655|2.0|This book is by no means a good representation of Steinbeck's ability to write.  He uses the most overplayed theme in literature of good vs. evil.  The seemingly obvious plot and significance of motifs (or lack there of) lend to a pretty weak recounting of his family history with the infamous Cain and Abel tale woven into the plot.  Much of the book is spent in narrative form, and when the simple and stolid characters do get a chance to talk, their words are tasteless and lack energy or fervor.  The plot didn't seem to move anywhere as I was repeatedly caught hoping for the book to end (it drags on for 602 pages).  In addition, Steinbeck attempts to use old fashioned cliches and metaphors, and fails miserably.  It is obvious that he tries to incorporate deep significance to certain aspects of the book and fails miserably.  For example, he uses this metaphor several times: \\"she must have had a pelvic arch of a whalebone, for she had big children one after the other.\\"  Maybe it's just me, but that's not very inspirational.  Lastly, Steinbeck crushes all chance for the reader to think for him/herself (even though there wasn't much thinking to do about this book anyway).  He reveals all the symbolic, deep thinking, significant ideas through his character dialogue and by outright statement of them.  At the beginning of Book IV, he expressly states the main theme of the novel to the reader, ruining all chance for the reader to think beyond the level of a first grader.  Overall, I was not very impressed with the level of writing in East of Eden.  Maybe this is because I had such high hopes for Steinbeck material.  Nonetheless, many people happen to like this novel.  It could be better (much better).
B000002KKC|3.0|With bar set so high for Fleetwood Mac after the enormous success of their last studio album \\"Rumours\\" it was surprising just how different a direction they took musically. It has long been known that most people treated this album as mediocre album however die hard fans and even non fans found this harder edged rock in roll album quite good. \\"Tusk\\" was the idea of guitar player / singer Lindsey Buckingham who wanted to make an album on a smaller budget and the result is a 2 record set with a varying degree of songs. \\"Tusk\\", the albums title track recorded with the USC Marching Band is a great rock tune while the ballads \\"Storms\\" and \\"Sara\\" are magical songs that prove just how much of an enchanting voice Stevie Nicks has. Christine Mcvie fares best with \\"Brown Eyes\\" and \\"Never Forget\\" while Buckingham does a good job with the hit single \\"The Ledge\\". Overall the album is good, but since allot of the material is radically different then the usual hits it makes it a tough sell.
B000002J6H|4.0|The Amazon.com review didn't quite hit the mark here.  Stills, in fact, *was* the most accomplished member of CSN.  He also wrote the best songs that will last the longest of the trio.  (..leaving out Mr. Young here since it would be tough for anyone to top that poet/visionary..)  Strongly advise picking up both of Still's first two solo albums; they fit together well.  Stills continued the great work with his band Manassas.  Soul is a good word to associate with Stills.  He sings and plays with soul, and examines the soul.
B000002KXO|3.0|After the band explored new musical styles and met with mixed results on their last album 1979's &quot;Tusk&quot; (Not counting the 1980 live album they made) they went back to the drawing board and they have come up with an offering that should please most Fleetwood Mac fans but more discriminating listeners may find this offering too safe. The band tries many different musical styles and comes up with only one really good tune, the intriguing &quot;Gypsy&quot; which seemed tailor made for Stevie's raspy voice. Other songs do impress like the lead single &quot;Hold Me\\" with Lindsey and the band seemingly having a good time on the song, which has no conviction but is a fun tune just the same. The problem for me is that most of the songs are just average. Most of the album just doesn't have any depth or conviction in the musical numbers. The songs, which range from the slow love song &quot;Oh Diane&quot; to the disappointing &quot;Eyes of The World&quot; just, do not play well to any kind of audience. The album is worth a listen, but don't expect anything in the vein of &quot;Rumours&quot; or even &quot;Tango In The Night&quot;
B000062TU1|4.0|I have to say right at the get go that I know absolutely nothing about Harry Potter. Zilch. Nada. Never read any of the books or heard anything about them. I had no idea what the blazes a hogwart or muggle was. But, I have to admit that I was a wee bit curious. What was all the fuss about?. I went into this film stone cold and was very surprised. First of all, you don't need to be a Harry encyclopedia. Things are pretty well explained to you. You won't be lost. I was expecting it. Daniel Radcliffe plays 11 year old Harry Potter, who is dropped on his aunt and uncle's doorstep as a baby. Flash forward 11 years later and Harry is living a most miserable life. His relatives are the most horrid bunch. They make Harry sleep under the stairs. Then, Harry begins to get letters from Hogwarts School. A large giant of a man named Hagrid(played by the loveable Robbie Coltrane)comes and tells Harry that he is a wizard and takes him to Hogwarts school for Wizardry. There, Harry befriends Ron(Rupert Gint), and Hermione(exceptionally played by the drop dead adorable Emma Watson). While learning his abilities at the school, Harry and his new friends discover that the sorcerer's stone is hidden under the school and that someone is trying to get to it. Who is it?. Why do they want it?. These are questions you will have to see the movie to find out. The supporting cast is the best of the best. These people include Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and the great Richard Harris. Keep your eyes open for cameos by John Cleese, John Hurt, and Julie Walters. They are all teriffic. Next up is the score. You can always count on John Williams to deliver the goods. He is a god. His musical score really catches that right whimsical fairy tale sound that is dead on perfect. Haunting and beautiful at the same time. The outfits were outstanding, as was the scenery and sets. Many sets were absolutely breathtaking. The castle itself is a wonderous piece of beauty in itself. I will say that the movie did seem a tad long. Then again, so are the books. The long running time did hurt it a tad bit. Daniel Radcliffe is exceptionally good as young Harry. He has wonderful charm and a great smile. But, I was in awe of little Emma Watson as Hermione. This young girl is wonderful. A star in the making. Director Chris Columbus(\\"Home Alone\\", \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\")really knows his stuff. The cast is great and he keeps the film tight and sharp looking. Kudoes to you Mr. Columbus. As for how faithful the movie is from J.K. Rowling's book, I can't say. I haven't read them. But from what I hear from everyone else, the movie was very faithful to the book. Maybe I should read them?. There are a number of whiners commenting on the movie being long and boring. If you are interested in quality than quantity, then this shouldn't be a problem at all. If you have short attention spans and have a hard time staying focused for a three minute video on MTV, then this is not for you. Critics have hailed this film as \\"The Wizard Of Oz Of Today\\". They just may be right.
B00005YU1O|4.0|mine's a four 'cause god didn't write this flick. (Or did she?) Indeed, the protagonist, in the scene where he's watching the movie about holy moments, when you realize the soul you're talking with is god manifested in mortal form, he's watching the movie, and get this--his face becomes the face of god, some kind of Inca fire god. For if god is omniscient, god needs to know what it's like to be you, including your aspect that doesn't know you're god. God thinks she's you, while she's you. Why choose this fragmentary fate, being ants and people reviewing this movie with the consciousness of ants? Because god chose life and not death. Not that ants don't have a sublime consciousness--a hundred thousand of them can coordinate the manufacture of an intricately nested tunnel-permeated nest, which seems like more than the people who rip on this movie as being superficial and meaningless have going on in their skulls. OK--I admit, taste in art varies crazily from spirit to spirit. Beauty may be truly relative and subjective, incapable of being shared, except by telepathy, which as Ethan Hawke explicates, is a real possibility in a world where rats can learn mazes faster when thousands of other rats in far away labs have already learned them. Beauty may be such that these reviewers can't see it in a film which at parts is as highly crafted as Dali or Monet, or maybe even subtler, because of the real human substrate behind the animation, a variable that makes the facial morphisms uncannily evocative, perhaps even more interesting than actual faces, due to artistic freedom, which normal people only have partial control over in the everyday life of their face expressions. The writing in this film has been variously attacked by these people as philisophical, as undergraduate, as pop-theoretical, as stonerist, as trivial, as primitive, as overly complex, indecipherable, blatantly obvious and heavy-handed. In short, the negative reviewers have used their own limitations, fears, and prejudices to brew up invective whose intensity bespeaks the possible validity of the film, given the personalities behind the attacks. I'll try to address the criticism. One--philosophers are not out-of-touch, abstract eggheads spouting irrelevancies from safe within their ivory towers. Instead, I have learned that they are people, damned by bigots merely because their brains are capable of intricacies unavailable to the average sheep--people with often truly elegant explanatory ability, who dedicate their lives to sharing their discoveries with each other or the rest of us, discoveries they consider meaningful and useful. They are sharers. And that's what the world needs, if you think it needs anything in the way of help. (Some view business as usual as a special gift, without realizing their luck of birth could have been different, leaving them in predicaments unspeakably tragic). Two--undergraduates are not the stupidest folk around. So labeling this movie's dialogue such is not really a criticism. There are youngsters whose poetic skills, musical inventiveness, spiritual spirituality, strength of vision, and so on rival, I dare say, what these critics can even dream of. This film is attacked by people who don't dream well. People who can only see what they've already seen. And we can probably submit to reality and say this is as it should be. We want to bother the critics in any way possible. Making them watch the faces of god, listen to the voices of angels and devils, think about things actually worth thinking about, is perhaps fitting punishment. Those who yearn for movies, like intravenous opiate drips, which \\"entertain\\" and \\"comfort\\" their fragile mentalities, can't be really told anything about the higher levels of human existence. They simply don't believe how good thought can be for people like the characters in this movie, who are farther above the sheep than the sheep are above ants. Should we even suppose the anti-waking-life critics are conscious? What do they do that would lead us to believe they are not automatons? What's going on in there besides darkness and twistedly pathetic computation? They may be artificial, but never intelligent. But what do i know--I'm lucky enough to have eliminated this type of critic from my immediate vicinities--I only know them through their sickening diatribes in venues like this. PleaSe tell me I'm wrong. I want to be. I know we live in a giant robot-world, eating nature and producing mostly misery--but I wish that most of the human moviegoers were not robots themselves. Proponents of strong AI may say There's nothing wrong with being a robot--leave them alone--they have merely been programmed a bit wrongly by insignificant and unenviable childhoods--you'd hate this film if you were one of them. Here we go, with the grace of god. I've been told not to listen to the negative ones. I guess i'm just programmed to take reviews seriously, even if their authors don't deserve to see Waking LIfe, let alone have access to DVD's, MAC machines, fast food, spectator sports and all the other lovely elements of their lives, which they can't examine, but which they force us to examine here when we're trying to contemplate what it means to see real artists doing their thing as delicately and powerfully as they can possibly struggle to do. It is a shame. But remind me--this shame is but a spoonful in the ocean of shame that is history.
0792844882|5.0|This is a great movie. Verhoeven has made many great movies, with the exception of his last \\"Hollow man\\" which I found incomplete. <br />However, I think Showgirls is an instance where most Americans don't get the point, whereas (Northern?) Europeans do get it. Americans seem to think that humorous movies have to be inherently inoffensive. That's not the case, and that is obviously not what Verhoeven (who is Dutch) did here.<br />This is not a \\"good bad movie\\", and it's not inane in any way. It's obscene, it's camp and it is a dramaturgical masterpiece. Also the acting is top notch and the photography wonderful. The only thing that made people hate this movie is because it deals with sex in a camp and unpretentious way. It's a modern \\"All about Eve\\" and it's right up there among the Ninja-feminist flicks such as Faster Pussycat by Russ Meyer (but the ending of the movie is better). <br />It's already reached cult status.
B00006690F|5.0|this cd is AWESOME! i luv it and i have only had it for 2 days!...i reccomend it to all the eminem fans in the world!... my fav songs are without me and hailie's song and and and all of them!...this wuz worth my money! i cant say any thing about the dvd tho cuz i dont have a dvd player but i bet its jus as awesome as the cd wuz!
1590710037|5.0|Buying this book was a gamble.  It sat provocatively upon the shelf as a slim volume shrink-wrapped on the shelf.  When I took the dive and purchased it, I realized many of the pages were only a quarter or half filled with text.  Had I been cheated?  Absolutely not.  You don't get a lot of words for your money, but you do get wisdom.  Pressfield puts forth the highly believable theory that many of our problems in life come from not fulfilling our calling and from an almost pathological need to take the path of least resistance instead of the path of greatest fulfillment.  He repeats the old advice about writers being committed to write everyday, but there is much more about the nature of inspiration and how to focus on the work itself, rather than obsessing about the fruits you hope to obtain.  The icing on the cake is that Pressfield takes you through his own history and shows how he finally triumphed over his own self-defeating behavior.  This is one self-help book worth the price of admission!
0141301066|4.0|This story is about a young girl that has extra-ordinardy powers that can move and lift objects from where they are. Matlida would visit the public library everyday, right after her mother left for bingo. Matilda's parents didn't really care for their incredibly gifted child. Her parents didn't know that she was reading material that they didn't read until  they were in ninth grade and here was a six year old that was reading Charels Dickens! I found that very cool, even though it is not true. After entering kindergarden, her teacher, Miss. Honey, saw Matlida for what she really was, a bright and yet small child with the facination of learning.<BR>     I picked this book because, there was nothing else to read in my house. Even though I have read it before I still forund it interesting to read. I enjoy the book much more than I enjoy the movie. The movie has the story all wrong from what Roald Dahl's story is like. I mean, in the book the setting is in an English town, but in the movie, it is set in a regular town, like Cerritos is.<BR>     I recomend this book to any reader, old or young, because, I found it rather enjoyable to read even though I read it when I was seven years of age. I loved this book just as my family has enjoyed it for years before me and for years after me.
B0000025BL|5.0|I was introduced to this album during the mid eightees as a teenage boy. The first couple of times I listened to it I merely thought it was OK, but something kept me listening and after a number holiday, much of  which was spent with Bat Out of Hell playing quite loudly in my headphones I fell in love with it. MeatLoaf's voice is one of the most amazingly powerful voices I have ever heard and suits the music perfectly. If you get a chance to hear MeatLoaf sing Gershwin on Larry Adler's tribute album, A Tribute to Gershwin, you will hear how wonderful his voice is. Having said that his best work is on Bat Out Of Hell, in particular the Ballads. For Crying Out Loud is one of the most pwerful and operatic rock songs ever and Heaven Can Wait is simply one of the most beautiful and moving songs ever recorded. If you only know Paradise by the Dashboard Lights give the album a go, Heaven Can Wait, For Crying Out Loud and Two Out of Three Ain't Bad in particular.<br />Bat Out Of Hell is one of the most popular albums ever, I believe it is still in the top 200 in the UK and US? It was not just a one off fad that sold heaps, it has kept selling heaps year after year as new generations discover its power and passion. <br />BTW, unlike most sequels, Bat Out Of Hell II is a worthy bearer of the title, seeing MeatLoaf and Jim Steinman once again reunited.
B000001FOL|4.0|Chelsea Girl, Nico's debut album, is made up of pretty songs, dominated by strings and woodwinds, supplemented by soft guitar, and with some interesting arrangements.  Most of the songs were written by by Jackson Browne, who played back-up guitar for Nico at the Electric Circus in New York during the time, and combinations of Nico's then-recent Velvet Underground mates.  Tho Browne was still a teenager, his three very pretty tunes here (the first two tracks and \\"Somewhere There's a Feather\\") outdo the uneven entries of Lou Reed/John Cale/Sterling Morrison.  \\"It Was a Pleasure Then,\\" the only song Nico was involved with authoring (she co-authored it with Reed and Cale), reflects a negative aspect of the Velvets, to allow themselves to be self-absorbed in eccentric, drag-on, incoherent stuff (e.g., \\"European Son,\\" \\"Sister Ray\\"), although the feeling of isolation is evocative.  But in spite of some distinction among songs, Chelsea Girl is above all a coherent, atmospheric album, if not a concept album.  That is, in some way, everything has a similar texture:  a somber but not deep sadness, a beauty that is not exactly dark, evoking perhaps a misty evening in the country, and at the same time having a subtly urban, urbane feel.  I'm not going to engage in the tired-out debate on Nico's voice, except to say it is pleasing to me.  It is rich and pretty, even if somewhat dry, and lyrics are clearly pronounced.  Her voice is the most prominent, consistent thing in the atmosphere, which I like.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I wasn't ready for the way this album was to change my life, when I was 13.  When I first listened to it I skipped over track 1 because I saw the whole page its lyrics took up in the booklet.  But I still remember the time I finally did listen to &quot;Front Row&quot;...it became one of my favourite songs of all time and an epitaph to my eighth grade year.  That might sound silly and sophomoric, but this entire album is responsible for getting me through adolescent depression (along with Radiohead's &quot;The Bends&quot;).  <BR>To me, every one of the 17 songs is an essential part of a cycle...Alanis' journey in trying to find herself, to grow up.  Her ability to eloquently wrap her feelings around her music is what we can relate to.  None of the songs are filler; they are all performed passionately, especially &quot;Front Row&quot;, &quot;The Couch&quot;, &quot;Thank U&quot; and &quot;Your Congratulations&quot;.  For anyone who thinks Alanis' music is unoriginal, just listen to the scathing drum loop at the beginning of &quot;Sympathetic Character&quot;, and the layering of synth and vocals on the choruses of &quot;Front Row&quot;.  Her vocals are raw and affecting, especially on the mini-epic &quot;The Couch&quot;.  And one overlooked gem is &quot;Would Not Come&quot;, about the elusiveness of happiness, which is strangely comforting.  The only drawback to this album, and Alanis in general, is the narrow musical range which her backing band seems to occupy most of the time.  With better musicians in tow, she could develop her sounds even further.<BR>I saw Alanis live in 1999 with a friend.  We could not believe that people were streaming out of the Air Canada centre doors during Alanis's performances of SFIJ pieces, only to stream back in at the strains of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; or &quot;Ironic&quot;.  This is Alanis's best album by far, although &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; is an earnest effort in a follow up to this masterpiece.  I believe that in 20-30 years from now, this will be remembered as the peak of her creativity and inspiration.  It will continue to inspire for years and years to come.
B0000026CN|3.0|Arguably Santana's strongest work within his mediocre '80s studio output, Blues for Salvador is a listenable CD with some high moments.  The soft jazz/rock \\"Bella,\\" a love song to Carlos' daughter, deserves a place of honor on any list of pretty Santana tunes.  With Chester Thompson's keyboards joining Carlos' guitar to create exquisite music with an atmospheric, relaxing texture, \\"Bella\\" has its own sound rather than the rehashed high-pitched guitar twangs of the triad of \\"Samba Pa Ti,\\" \\"Europa,\\" and \\"Moonflower.\\"  In the title cut, Carlos' guitar expresses a sort of yearning, passionate but not intense, and sometimes even smug, with a modified blues feel.  It is also very atmospheric, because of the perfect overlaying of Thompson's keyboards with Carlos' guitar work.  However, while the other tracks are decent, they contain nothing earth shattering.  \\"Hannibal\\" has some good guitar soloing but is just a moderately improved remake of the Zebop version, and \\"Deeper, Dig Deeper\\" is an instrumental of the verseline version of Freedom.  Among the other songs are a concert jam and two outtakes from the \\"Love Never Fails\\" sessions.  The material from those sessions never became a solo Santana album as planned, instead appearing here as well as on Freedom and Viva Santana.   Thus, Blues for Salvador largely amounts to a patchwork CD.  Vocals are ephemeral; the music is the thing, and there is some good stuff, but not enough to justify a fourth star.
B00006690F|5.0|I think that Eminem is great. He is the only rapper that does not sing about souped-up cars, money, and sex. In fact, on the contrary, he seems to make fun of it. I admire this in a person. I do not think that people should be limited on what they can say or do. Eminem is a role model to me, except for the sueing, the guns, and the makihng fun of his momma. I do give this CD a 5 outta 5, for it's expressivness and such. ...
B0000640RX|4.0|When i was a boy,i sneakily hired the original First Blood on VHS...i also watched what was the start of the eighties action movie.I love all three of these movies as they symbolise all the entertainment i loved when i was a kid.<BR>Stallone is great as Rambo and what he can't do in the acting department, he makes up for in the action. The original Movie has its moments but its parts two and three that really has the bulk of the action as Stallone personally re-fights Vietnam and then kicks the Russians out of Afghanistan personally.   <BR>Being from England,i can understand the feelings towards the character of Rambo by the American people in the eighties as he symbolised the American hero who defended his country with honour. I personally enjoyed watching Stallone wipe out the Russians without any remorse in the first sequel and fighting his own Vietnam battle and winning.<BR>I already own this boxset. I had it imported from the U.S because in England, Rambo III is censored badly (as is Cliffhanger,another favourite stallone movie of mine)<BR>Buy this now...Hollywood doesn't have the guts to make them like this anymore!!
B00006690F|2.0|This is no where near as groundbreaking as his previous efforts. Eminem used to be groundbreaking and now it seems as if he is trying to fall in line with every other 2 bit rapper on the music scene.
B000021Y77|5.0|Great film! In fact, it's pretty scary how many times in the past couple of years it's been [copied]. When I watched the first episode of \\"Alias\\", I couldn't believe how blatantly they were stealing from \\"Run Lola Run\\".<br />It's fun, it's fast-paced, it has a great soundtrack and it's worthy of some respect. Plus, I think Franka Potente is remarkably sexy in this movie. <br />The DVD has some okay extras. If you're not into reading your films, then you can access the english overdub. And for fans of the soundtrack there's a music video for the single. But the real reason to but this DVD is re-watch-ability.

You have to play an unending stream of nightmarish games to use the DVD! <br />The disc with the movie is easy enough to figure if you work it out logically. You'll be shown a quickly edited series of words. Then the DVD will ask you which word wasn't shown to you in the sequence. To start the movie, pick the word \\"Watch\\" out of the menu. Movie will play. <br />But put in the Special Features DVD and it's just dumb luck if you find ANYTHING. In fact, by the time you see something, you'll be so annoyed you can't enjoy it.<br />I know they were trying to simulate psychological tests or perhaps the experience of having no memory. But they went too far. It's infuriating, it's monotonous and it's not worth [the money] for the aggravation. Rent it - Don't buy it!
0142000655|5.0|The bible is possibly one of the oldest and most read book in the world.  There have been countless numbers of books based on biblical allusions, and \\"East of Eden\\" by John Steinbeck ranks top among the ones that I have read.  The novel is a modernized re-creation of the story of Cain and Abel, two brothers in the Bible.  Steinbeck incorporates the themes of this old biblical story to explore the truths of the human soul.  <BR>The story details the layers of good and evil through the characters and relationships of the families of Adam Trask and Samuel Hamilton.  Adam Trask is a man who, blinded by illusions and a lost within himself, travels to California with his beautiful, but insidious, prostitute wife.  There he meets Samuel Hamilton, a man poor in money but wealthy in life.  The novel chronicles the development and relationships of the two men, their families, and the people surrounding their lives.  It is an excellent novel, for Steinbeck effectively integrates his message throughout the book.  <BR>This is not a carefree, happy novel; rather, it is very dark as it explores the blacker areas of the human soul.  Despite the foreboding mood and circumstances of the novel, Steinbeck manages to assert an uplifting message about the strength of human goodness and the perseverance of the human soul.  Although the novel is fiction, he magnifies human nature through exaggerated circumstances.  We may see a hidden part of ourselves, whether it is deceit on one occasion or jealousy on another, through the characters in the novel.  We may also realize that the true message of the novel is indeed a very essential part of our lives.  Perhaps this is why I feel that East of Eden is such an exceptional novel: not only does it bravely delve into an exploration of human morality, but it causes us to reflect on our own existence.
B00000K31V|2.0|Well, for a start it's nothing like The Matrix. eXistenZ is in my opinion one of davids weakest movies. He's trying to do a flash virtual-reality, cyberspace, &lt;insert fave cyber word here&gt; movie, but it just doesn't work. The acting is average at best, but you get the impression it's not the actors fault (read: bad script). The problem is this: The movie makes little sense, the plot jumps around all over the place, and there are gooey, bio, odd looking things all through it (which is of course one of cronenbergs trademarks). Very low budget stuff, and as one person said earlier, it's clear that cronenberg knows nothing about computers (ie. ever heard of backing up your precious data!! I really have no idea what he was actually trying to do with this one (oh and it has no real special effects, just lot's of 1970's gore and goo effects instead).<br />There is better stuff out there by far. Try Brazil, or Dark City for much better sci-fi, or Mulholland Drive for more weirdness.<br />High point of the movie: Jennifer Jason Leigh (she has great legs)<br />Low point of the movie: the bio-pods are just sad......
B00005JKCF|3.0|The movie I could say was pretty good, the costumes were well done, the computer graphics were well played, Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were good as the leading parts. However, if you like movies that have a romantic ending, this is not the movie for you. I won't give away what happend, but the way the movie endend seemed like a total waste.The way it ends may satisfy a guy, but girls who see this movie may be a little dissapointed.I enjoyed Spider Man, but I had to give it 3 stars because of the way it ended.
B000066AXE|4.0|I didn't know what the hell was going on at first. I didn't know what to believe until I got to the end. I was wondering all through the movie \\"Is he crazy or not? The end had a magnificient ending proving that anyoone can overcome dissabilities and excel. I also liked the message that the wife sent to us movie goers and her message said to me to stand by the one you love, even if it may be tough. Go see the Movie. One Love.

0767802470|4.0|I find this movie alot more interesting in it's original German language, and boring in english, I mean all of the cast members are German except a few (Jurgen, others) & so I rather own the dvd because elsewhere you have to watch it english dubbed & in 2 parts (Credits roll at the end of part 1 on VHS/TV). I also recommend the DVD to help you learn German as a second launguage as it is an easy language to learn. One last thing- Scene selection is nice, as this movie is about 6 hours long which eliminates the fast forward & rewind buttons & the irritation that comes with doing that. As a half American-German my heart is very much open to the German people & this movie is strange to live with because it's like being a part of that war, & I was born in America. -BTW-<BR>I wish that the American & German people had never fought! I can see that war is meaningless & that the language barrier splits us apart. In the film you can hear them speaking of dislike of the nazis.<BR>You'll see that the crewman are like American people but have a different launguage & serve a different type of leader. At that time (1941) they were fighting british people only, America entered in 1943-44. I would highly recommend Saving Private Ryan 'along' with this movie!
0142000655|5.0|John Steinbeck's East of Eden has been one of the most influential readings of my life.  Within merely 600 pages, Steinbeck enlightens his readers with the most controversial and enthralling issue of life: its purpose.  If you have ever doubted your existence or questioned who or what you are living for, this book will definitely pour you with insight.  Contrastingly, if you have never encountered these doubts, this novel will force you to reevaluate your cordial acceptance.  Steinbeck oversteps the boundries of traditionality and conservatism and audaciously expresses his unfiltered, most purest thoughts.  There is never a dull or meaningless moment in this book.  Although the plot of events may appear somewhat unorganized and haphazard,  each incident has its unignorable significance within the novel and a single misplace or change of word would desecrate its message.  Not only that, Steinbeck is amazing in his character analyzations.  Through his detailed and meticulous descriptions, the readers are able to protrude into the character's deepest thoughts and scrutinize it from every single aspect.  There is not one character that stands out as the main protaganist; each individual has his own complex personality and mindset and Steinbeck magnificently portrays this complication, inflating his characters into realistic, 3-D human flesh.  He also addresses common themes, or rather experiences, that the common reader can relate to.  The most developed theme within the book is that of the struggle between good and evil, but he also discusses issues such as a parent's favoritism of one child over another and the disastrous effects that are imposed upon the unpreferred child.  We also see frequent themes such as love and rejection, which make the story a very personal experience.  All in all, this is a mind-blowing masterpiece, as well as a heart-warming tale, that will leave you breathless and asking for more.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I really enjoy this movie.  The cast was fabulous.  This was Audrey Hepburn's last appearance on the big screen as well, in a role as \\"Hap\\", the angel who Pete (Richard Dreyfuss) first encounters after dying from his plane exploding.<br />Holly Hunter shines as Dorinda, Pete's girlfriend, who tries to come to terms with Pete dying.  John Goodman is also funny and loveable as Al, one of the pilot trainers.<br />I was really disappointed when \\"Ghost\\" (although Ghost is a good movie in and of itself too) came out a little while later, because it seemed to have stolen many themes from \\"Always\\", such as male lead having problems saying \\"I love you\\", male lead being able to have an influence on surviving loved ones after dying, lead female being able to be told eventually \\"I love you by lead male.  Ghost seemed to get more of the rave reviews and sentimental following than Always, because it was a \\"sexier\\" movie. acted by \\"handsomer\\" actors.  Always was told more like a fairy tale.  Anyway, I digress.<br />I found this movie to be magical and I really enjoyed it.
B00005UQD5|3.0|I was at the video store looking for a trashy horror movie to have a good laugh over. I encountered Session 9, and thought that it actually might not be a half bad movie. A review on the box said it was a \\"psychological thriller in the style of the Blair Witch Project\\". So I rented it. I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt for most, if not all, of the movie. I quite enjoyed the psychological elements of the movie, although my friend did note that the characters spent most of the first half of the movie talking. It was interesting talk, at least. I loved the psychological sessions, and particularly the character of Billy. Princess was good, too. Then there was Simon. I'm not sure how much I can say about where the movie went wrong without giving too much away, but I'll try. At the end of the movie it turns out that it wasn't really a psychological thriller at all. Oh, no, no, no. It turns out it was a... * spoiler alert * case of demonic possession. Well, at least it was an excuse to * spoiler alert * kill off most of the main characters. What occurred to me at the movie's end was that the movie had been ambitious, and the director had clearly tried hard to make it a good movie. Good effort. They almost made it.
B000031EGV|4.0|The first time I saw this (on cable), I was very surprised.  From all the commercials promoting the film, I thought it was for children.  Possibly that's why it didn't do as well in the theaters as it could have done--once parents spread the word, it was hard to find an audience.  This is NOT for children.  It's too dark a story line and I was a bit creeped out by the spiders scene.  Now, that said, I did enjoy the film but ... it was missing something but they couldn't put their finger on it.
B000068OCS|5.0|Upon seeing that it is to be released in a few months, I had to immediately preorder it.<br />This movie is the definition of hypnotic reverie.  The time lapse and slow motion cinematography set to the haunting and beautiful Phillip Glass music describe the duality of the \\"man in nature/man vs. nature\\" myth.  At the end you are emotionally wrung out feeling hollow and exalted at the same time, fearing and hoping for the future of mankind.<br />You MUST see this movie.
6300213668|2.0|The worship of this movie must cease.<br />First of all, I don't even think they deserved to use the name \\"Grease\\" since it bears so little similarity to the Broadway show.  Missing from the movie are lovable characters Doody and Roger, replaced by a hybrid of the two named Putsy, who basically sits in the background for the entire show.  The two deleted character's songs?  \\"Those Magic Changes\\" basically becomes a background tune at the prom, and I have no idea (can't remember) what happens to \\"Mooning\\", but both songs completely lose their luster outside their original environments.  It also results in the deletion of one of the best scenes in the whole play, where Roger proclaims himself the Mooning Champion of Rydell high.<br />Also deleted from the movie--\\"Alone at the Drive-in Movie\\", reduced to an instrumental.  It was a funny, goofy tune, that fit in well with the parodical nature of the original show.  It is replaced by the 70's sounding \\"Sandy\\", which is too overdramatic and overwrought for that scene. The funny \\"Alma Mater\\" is reduced to background music in the opening scenes.  \\"Look at Me, I'm SAndra Dee\\" is moved way too far up in the show, in a really nonsensical part of the movie.  it originally came at the end of the first act in the play, which made more sense.<br />And, worst of all, Greased Lightning is sung by Zuko, and not Kenickie, like in the play.  This makes little sense.  Zuko singing about Kenickie's car?  The idea behind the original song was that Greased Lightning was a pile of crap that only Kenickie believed in, and got scoffed at for, so his song was him vowing to turn it into a champ.<br />Alright, but changes aside, how is the movie?<br />Again, not great.  Scenes dragged on aimlessly for too long. Danny trying out for sports could have been easily cut down by 3 minutes or so.  The gag wore thin.  The prom's length was okay, but very boring, and basically a vehicle for Travolta to show off his dancing.  Yes, in the play, it's a big\\"dance\\" scene too, but it is way too straightforward in the movie to be all that enjoyable.<br />Rizzo's \\"serious\\" scene is pretty much lost in the movie since it's pointlessly taken to the drive-in and tossed aside minutes later, rather than being done at the later party like in the play, and being a somewhat emotional scene.<br />So many of the funniest scenes are deleted from the original play.  And even the melodrama is removed.  The funny parts aren't funny enough, the serious parts are too overdramatic for what this body of work really was--a parody of 50's culture, music, and life.<br />Moreso, all of the \\"high schoolers\\" in the movie looked about 30 years old.  Most of them could not pass for high schoolers even with makeup and costuming.  Sonny looked almost 35. Perhaps if they had done a better job of wardrobe and makeup this would have been avoided.<br />Overall, I think the only decent part ofthis movie is \\"Greased Lightning\\" for it's dance moves.  Other than that, this is a soulless remake of a great show that doesn't do the original justice.<br />P.S. I'm playing Roger now in a local performance of Grease.  So I know from experience!
B00005B36H|5.0|First of all, I must say that I am (or at least used to be) a New-age listener with little or no respect for Metal. Tools &quot;Lateralus&quot; was the album to get me into that kind of music, and i must say it had done so well!<BR>The music is definately different than your avarage metal, and the lyrics and singing amazingly blend in to form a masterpiece. MJK's voice is truly one of the best voices ever to sing. <br />Perhaps one of the least noticable advantages that Lateralus has is its lyrics. For us Occultists, the \\"weird\\" lyrics could actually strike up a meaningful idea, even if it was presented in segments spread across the song. Now, weather the band actually intended the lyrics to be that way or not, is something I cannot tell. But anyone with some occult background might agree that someone mentioning Saturn, lead, stone, water, transmutation and grudeges altogether is clearly referring to Hermetic ideas. This is just one example of the many occult allusions present in this masterpiece. <br />I would recommend this work to any metal-listener who has interests that go beyond the usual thrashing and roaring commonly found in metal songs (but worry not, you'll find some of that here!). I would also recommend that to any occult or new age listener who doesn't mind heavy music.
0345440900|4.0|This book strikes a good balance if you are drawn to a structured, scheduled style of parenting, but you find &quot;Babywise&quot; too unyielding.
B00005JKBC|2.0|The story is actually interesting, but unlike Tom Clancy, the writer(s) don't create a story around a true view of reality.  Instead, they start with a warped Hollywood view of intelligence operations and CIA agents, and then develop a story that makes heroes out of their two primary stars.  It's pure Hollywood, but it is entertaining.  If you're a Brad Pitt or Robert Redford fan, you'll like it.
B00003CXI1|5.0|It was great to watch Harry Potter again and revisit the world of Hogwarts.  The book literally comes alive with the performance of this children's movie.  My kids enjoyed not only the movie, but plays for hours with the enclosed special features such as making potions,clicking on the characters to make them talk and the game.  The extra disc (which has the extra footage and bonus games) is a nice feature to keep separate the movie from the extra fun (and less chance of damaging the movie).  Overall it was an excellent choice to purchase for the kids!<br />The only complaint I had was that many scenes from the original big screen production was that some scenes had been trimmed to make the movie shorter (ie Dudley's birthday trip to the zoo).  I would have prefered the original movie unaltered, but it still is a great story!<br />rick from florida
0553208845|5.0|A very interesting book that tells the tale of searching for enlightenment, a timeless topic, that brought with it lots of understanding and peace. I never read a book that I enjoyed this much! Being sixteen, I feel that this book will continue to influence me for many years to come, the pages old and worn.
0140186395|5.0|This book is a masterpiece that richly interweaves mesmerizing characters, enduring themes, and human impulses.  Steinbeck's style and tone as a writer was what made the book magnificent from the beginning.  He is a true storyteller, in his exposition of characters' natures, lacks, and desires.  He portrays characters with exploratory truth.  Samuel Hamilton is the wise, philosophical idealist who only wants to get a rich drink of life.  Cathy, on the other hand, is a being that is not human, and has consequential evil tendencies.  Brothers, such as Adam and Charles, and Aron and Cal, go through the endless tales of jealousy, love, and hurt.  <BR>     Steinbeck eloquently explores many themes-perhaps they are the eternal themes of life.  He explores the struggle between good and evil, the fight for parental love, and the question of identity.  Rather than keeping the scope of the novel narrow, he connects it to the history of the world.<BR>     I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes being moved by literature.  It will stir emotions and stimulate the mind.
B00006690F|1.0|Yes, imo his first 2 albums are works of art, but that's the reason I was so shocked and disappointed when I heard this CD.  I don't see what people see in the single at all.  It puts me to sleep, and the beat sounds way to similar to Purple Hills.  And the  tame lyrics here are about him, which I don't want to hear or care at all about.  See, the first 2 cd's had songs so good you got into it instantly, but there isn't ONE song here that got me hooked.  Not one.  The beats are tired and seem like they came from the early 90's.  He annoyingly thinks that the press still gives a care about him, and includes uncalled for 9/11 references.  He even refers to himself as a \\"soilder\\", which is something he has no idea of what that really is, besides song #7 is an immature rant someone like Master P used to cook up.  Of course this CD has skits, they are funny for the 1st time then you won't want to hear them again.  Also, on that song where he sings, he wouldn't get to the quarterfinals of \\"Popstars\\" with that voice.  If Eminem released this as his first album no one would pat any attention to him.  Because right now one of the worst rap singles to ever come out is number 1 for a while now.  But if he realeases another album like this, he may have to start counting his change.
B00005JKGK|5.0|&quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; is a ground-breaking film with universal themes that anyone can relate to regardless of age, gender or nationality.  Truly epic in its scope and haunting vision, the movie is also deeply heartfelt and familial, enhancing its ability to speak to the audience in myriad, boundless ways.  This is an intimate portrait of two generations of Asian women - the mothers who risked everything to create a better life for their daughters in the United States.  At this juncture in American history, the movie resonates more than ever by reminding the viewer of our fore-mother's immigrant experience.  In doing so, &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; serves as a vibrant contemporary document on freedom and the pursuit of happiness.<br />Ming-Na Wen (now known to millions as Ming-Na or Deb Chen on NBC's top rated drama &quot;ER&quot;) is superb in the central role of June, greiving for her recently deceased mother with the 3 &quot;aunties&quot; who miantain her place at the mah-jon table.  Their gatherings continue, with June's presence, and in the process form the backdrop from which these women's personal stories and life-journies are shared.  Each auntie - and their now-adult Americanized daughters - explain their often-harrowing attempt to escape Communist China and their difficult transition to an American way of life in the U.S.  Tears flow in both generations, not only for what has been lost, but also for what has been found here - a society with different values that challenges these women in unexpected but nearly universal ways.  As both generations - and all eight women eventually - share their stories, the viewer literaly steps into each life, aware of where the characters end up, yet fully experiencing the challenges each of them faces.  Set against the backdrop of June's trip to China to find her long-lost sisters (whom her mother was forced to leave behind in one of the film's most powerful sub-plots) &quot;The JOy Luck Club&quot; can be ANY family's story, regardless of how long they or their ancestors have lived in this country.  In doing so, it succeeds at building bridges to the past, while staunchly looking ahead to the future.  This is the sort of film that embraces real life and human themes, but also puts a face on what it means to be a zero-generation immigrant, or an exile in a land far from one's home and culture.  Like the current spate of Latin and Soviet block immigrants and the last century's explosion of new Americans from Europe and Africa, we recognize through the characters the meaning and value of freedom, family and peace as well as the unimaginable challenges our elders faced in coming to this land of opportunity.<br />The cast of Asian-American actresses is uniformly superb, straddling a delicate balance for the viewer that requires they be both accessible AND remote at once.  Although long seen as a &quot;woman's movie&quot; the film deserves to be widely experienced by all people, including men, who might otherwise reject the film as nothing more than handkerchief fluff.  In fact, since few similar films exist with central male characters, &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; stands as a film I believe many men would embrace if they give it a chance.  The film speaks for our fathers and brothers, not just our sisters, mothers or wives.  This is grand, epic storytelling with a heart, beautifully directed by Wayne Wang and amazingly accessible in every way, due to its stellar cast.  Had there been a Best Ensemble Oscar designed to honor the contribution of a group of actors at the top of their form, &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; cast would have surely been honored.  <br />A magnificent film that fully captures what it means to be an American of any descent.
B000067DNC|5.0|SG-1 is crazy good, and Season 2 was arguably the best season so far.  As with many TV adaptations, the sophomore year is when a series tends to truly expand its horizons from the original, and this is certainly true with Stargate SG-1.  Season Two lays the groundwork for many of the key storylines of the series, so it is a must for any viewer.  I've been awaiting this since the first box set, especially with the Region 2 DVD's being up to Season Four.<br />I cannot stress to anyone enough who has not watched the TV series that it is superb.  If you would have asked me over a year ago about SG-1, I would have dismissed it easily as a cheesy Made-In-Canada (don't fret, I'm Canadian) Sci-Fi series.  True, a lot of that would have been from my bias from the movie, and that it starred Patty and Selma's hero MacGyver ;-), but after only seeing a few shows, I became quickly hooked.  I was blown away by the unbelievable chemistry of the cast, the great story writing, and the quality of the special effects.  We truly need more advocates for the series, as good TV is often hard to find.  I'm about to preorder my copy now...
B00005A46T|1.0|Now, when I first heard wait and bleed, I thought, wow! What an awsome song. Slipknot also hit it great with songs like surfacing and spit it out. So naturally, I went right out and bought IOWA. What a mistake! Slipknot has absolutely no talent what so ever. They masked this fact in their self-titled album with some nice riffs and so-so lyrics. When you listen to IOWA, this reality is blown in your ears with moans, screams, and yelling. I know this is what metal is (and I love metal), but give me a break. If I could cut a cd by screaming and cussing into the microphone, I would, but I have integrity. Please, do yourself a favor, download \\"people=....\\" off the internet and buy a quality metal cd!
B00006690F|3.0|In Eminem's new album he rails against the politicians who preach free speach, yet deny the rapper his; angrily analyses of his relationships with his daughter, mother and wife, and spends a lot of time denying the accusation that, as a white artist making African-American music he is selling the art form short. If this sounds familiar it is not suprising, since Eminem has made exactly the same album he made last time.<BR>This is a pity since at times this record proves how powerful and individual a voice Eminem has, and suggests how important he is capable of becoming. <BR>On White America the rapper critisises state-sponsered hypocrisy then ends with the most feeble of cop-couts. Sing for the moment is a passionate defense of Eminem's art, but the rappers ramblings become so convoluted that it is impossible to tell what point he is trying to make. I could go on but it is fair to say that Eminem could do much better.<BR>He is a gifted rapper; he is an often brilliant, frequently witty writer, nobody doubts this any more, apart, it would seem, from Eminem himself.<BR>But his frame of reference is desperately limited. If only he was to add some substance to all that style, he would surely produce the significant record that he still threatens to make.
B000002H97|5.0|No doubt that any of Metallica's cds are great, but this one I really enjoy to listen to.  It has great hits like Enter Sandman, Holier than Thou, Sad But True and The Unforgiven which has a follow up song of The Unforgiven entitled The Unforgiven II. This was one of the first Albums I became hookes on Metallica and is also a good starting point for any one else. All of thier songs and albums are truly tremendous but this is a really great item for any true Metallica fan.
B000001DQI|5.0|This is one of rock/pops classic albums and has been a favorite of mine for over twenty years now!.  Staring with Funeral For A Friend / Love Lies Bleeding, IMHO one of the best songs in rock history, this album shines all the way through.  The band behind EJ is incredible, listen to Davey Johnstone's guitar and Dee Murray's crackling bass on the opening track and you will be sold.  Candle In The Wind, The Title track, and Bennie And The Jets got the most radio play.  The real classics though are the above mentioned opening track, All The Young Girls Love Alice, Roy Rogers, and the beautiful Harmony.  Writing this makes me want to listen again and this classic collection of outstanding songs is second only to Madman Across The Water in the EJ catalog.  A must have!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|i've been listening first to his acoustic renditions (downloaded) and to room for squares since a year ago march when my daughter saw him live in tuscon.  i saw him recently in california.  he is a major superstar in the making...in the same songwriting league as joni mitchell, james taylor and paul simon.  his guitar work is beautiful.  each of his songs is as unique as were the beatles',. his lyrics are truly touching, and his voice evokes deeply felt emotions.  john mayor is in a league of his own.  however, i agree with another reviewer that his acoustic renditions are more beautiful.  he is one artist who sounds better accompanied by only a bass guitar than backed by a band.
B000066AXC|4.0|For those of us who remember \\"The Andy Griffith Show\\", and were wondering what would become of the actor who played Opie--here he is. Ron Howard's directorial masterpiece is displayed here as he depicts the story of mathematical genius and Princeton University legend, John Nash.<br />When John Nash arrives at Princeton in the 1940's he is granted, a little strange and eccentric and not always entirely friendly. But that doesn't mean there is anything wrong with him, does it? As he struggles to complete his rigorous courses in graduate school, he is accompanied by his loyal and literary-minded roommate, Chris Herman. When Nash manages to complete a revolutionary theory on economics, he is told that he is either extremely pretentious and supercilious or has changed the world of business transactions in an unimaginable fashion. Fortunately, for him, the latter proves to be true.<br />Nash is given a position at the prestigious Wheeler Institute and teaching position at Princeton. It is here that he meets the beautiful, intelligent, and compassionate Alicia. As he cultivates a friendship and affinity with her, he is also astounded to be enlisted as a decoding expert for the CIA. The job is intense as John Nash realizes the consequences of what will happen if he fails (possible destruction of the US by the Russians) or gets caught. Yet his desire for love leads him to propose and marry Alicia, and for a while it seems that Nash has the life any intellectual would dream of.<br />Yet his work becomes more and more constrictive and his mysterious boss regards his attachments and prospective family with contempt. Things close in on John Nash when he is giving a lecture at Harvard University. A psychiatrist approaches him and gives him an order to be taken to a psychiatric hospital. It is hear that his reality comes down around him with a crashing halt. As Nash gradually realizes the truth about his life and his illness (schizophrenia), he is forced to make some dramatic decisions about his life. The medication for schizophrenia at this time, had severe side-effects including drowsiness, sexual dysfunction, and withdrawal. Yet when Nash tries to dismiss his illness, his attempts prove gravely dangerous. It is only when he enlists his profound intelligence and the support of family and friends that he can learn to push aside his illness and regain his life.<br />This was a spectacular movie! The portrayal of John Nash's delusions delude the audience as well. I had always thought of Russel Crowe as being kind of a diva, but he actually proved to do a very good job in this role. And relative-unknown Jennifer Connelly was perfect as Nash's adoring and loyal wife. The only problem with the movie is that if you dig beneath the surface, you realize that Nash was not exactly the tender, gushy-about-his-wife sweetheart that he was when he accepted the Nobel Prize. Rumors of adultery and arrogance have run rampant after this movie came out. Nevertheless, I think Ron Howard did right to leave these details out as he was trying to show the audience psychosis in a different light. Although it is long, this movie is very powerful and intensive in many of its scenes, particularly after Nash's initial hospitalization and diagnosis. I believe this is an important film that can counter-influence stereotypes brought on by the recent Andrea Yates case. I hope Hollywood decides to promote more movies of this genre.
B00006690F|5.0|I have been a fan of Eminem ever since i can remember him coming out, even before he became \\"big\\" and this is by far the best i have ever heard from him. It still has the regular, controversal Eminem perks but it has more depth than other albums. He is actually rapping about reality and things that matter in his life to him and i think it is just great! I loved every single song the first time i hear them. But the best one on the album, by far, is \\"Hailies Song\\". I think it is totally great to hear almost a compasionate, serious side of eminem, especially when he is talking about his daughter. Overall, this is a great CD and i encourage everyone to check it out!
6305784078|3.0|Our kindergartner daughter, who has a very low threshold for Disney witches and other \\"mean people,\\" really enjoyed this movie, especially the Warner Bros.-ish hijinks involving the butler Edgar and the two dogs.  East Asian parents, or parents of East Asian kids, beware though:  among the ethnic stereotyping typical of Disney, there's a horrid (though mercifully brief) caricature of a Chinese person in the jazz scene involving \\"cats\\" of various backgrounds.  Did the most vicious stereotype in the movie have something to do with its production during the worst years of the Vietnam War?

B00005NEUF|5.0|Okay , I'd heard the hype, but I'd also heard the music and I couldn't deny they had some great songs, so when I finally found the vinyl version I snapped it up. Boy am I glad I did too.<br />this is a great ALBUM, and I mean ALBUM it's not some pop band with a couple singles and the rest of their album will be filled w/ throw away tracks this is one complete piece of work. You don't find a complete album much any more, artists (if you can call most of em' that)seem to be interested in a hit single not a great record. The Strokes however are not some fluffy pop band they are rock and roll, and they made a rock and roll album. They're exciting, they're retro-modern, they're just plain great.
0802130208|5.0|A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole. Highly recommended.<br />He's egotistical, erudite, ejaculatory (literally), and explosive. He's \\"emptily verbose\\" (Merriam-Webster's definition number 3 for \\"gassy\\"). He's also that-gassy, a man with a flux. He's Ignatius J. Reilly, a monster of a man with a master's degree, a faulty pyloric valve, a love for Boethius and The Consolation of Philosophy, a hatred for modern life, a passion against anything to do with sex (at least sex involving a second person), and a distinctly lower-class New Orleans lifestyle. He's also a man about whom his own pet phrase could apply: \\"Do I believe what I am seeing?\\"<br />Set in the New Orleans of the 1960s, A Confederacy of Dunces begins with an incident with an overzealously inept policeman that leads Ignatius, one of the most unforgettable characters of American fiction, into a world with which he is unfamiliar and ill-equipped-work. As a result, he encounters a cornucopia of characters-from the cynical female owner of the laughably named \\"Night of Joy\\" to the wizened owner of the equally ill-named \\"Paradise Hotdogs\\"-who are as unforgettable as Our Hero. The most memorable is undoubtedly the generically named Jones, who, behind his dark glasses and his cloud of cigarette smoke, manages to see the world, its people, and the ironies of situation all too clearly. There are also Ignatius's wine-loving mother, his irascible neighbor, and \\"Myrna Minx\\"-the closest Ignatius has ever had to a girlfriend.<br />Ignatius, taken away from his magnum opus (written on a series of Big Chief tablets strewn everywhere in his room in his mother's house) and the modern movies he so likes to deride, touts the value of The Consolation of Philosophy and bemoans the work of Fortuna while attempting to leave nothing to chance. To feed his laziness and lack of desire to work, he works hard at being sly, devious, and manipulative. He carefully plans and plots his efforts from the perspective of a man who has little perception of human nature; the results are hilariously unexpected-the whims of Fortuna. In the end, Ignatius's life, such as it is, will never be the same thanks to his forced interaction with the outside world.<br />A Confederacy of Dunces will make you laugh out loud and, at the same time, you will probably detect an undertone of sadness, even hopelessness. As Walker Percy notes in his introduction, perhaps this is due to the knowledge that author Toole committed suicide. But perhaps it is equally due to the absurdity of modern life that the adventures of the larger-than-life Ignatius reveal at every turn.<br />Diane L.

0446677450|1.0|I will save you the expense of purchasing this book by telling you its only worthwhile point:  Buy income-generating assets and limit liabilities.  I haven't spoiled anything.  This is found in oodles of basic economic textbooks.  There.  Now you can go outside and play in the sun with loved ones rather than wading through the mind-numbing contrast of a financially rich dad to a financially poor dad.  Also, the title should have a disclaimer that &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; apply merely to finances, for it's exactly the opposite the case when it comes to the richness and poverty of character for each dad.  In fact, if it weren't for the thickness of the crass consumer, I'd suspect that this were confederate agitprop for Marxism.  I'm sure Marx is smiling in his grave over the depiction of a rich dad who got that way by exploiting workers with the smallest wage possible why the dad who actually cared for others had financial difficulties.
B000066C1N|4.0|The main reason to buy this cd is for the song &quot;Run Free&quot;, it is perhaps Zimmer's best piece of orchestral work ever, and the best piece of score that I can remember in recent years. The Bryan Adams songs get better everytime you hear them, but it really helps if you saw and liked the movie (which I did).
B000007491|4.0|I don't usually consider myself a big Supertramp fan. Personally I felt Breakfast in America was rather overrated. I admit they made some fine music, but the problem is the production, as the band sounded often obsessed with studio perfection. Not this, their 1970 debut. Roger Hodgson and Rick Davies are here, with future King Crimson lyricist Richard Palmer-James on guitar, and drummer Bob Millar. Hodgson's voice is still very unmistakable, it just occured to me how much he sounded like Yes' Jon Anderson, particularly on this album. But Rick Davie's voice is still very unrecognizable here, and you won't be able to tell that this was the same guy who sang \\"Bloody Well Right\\", \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", \\"Lover Boy\\", \\"Your Poppa Don't Mind\\" (from 1971's Indelibly Stamped, for those who aren't familiar with that song, which are many), and many others. In 1970, Supertramp was more of a typrical prog rock band. Lots of Hammond organ, some electric piano (but not played in the style of \\"Dreamer\\" or \\"The Logical Song\\"), more guitar than I'm accustomed to on any of their other albums, some occasional use of flageolet (a six-holed recorder). Several ballads like \\"Aubade\\" and \\"Words Unspoken\\", plus a big prog rock epic in the form of \\"Try Again\\", and a couple of great rocking numbers like \\"It's a Long Road\\" and \\"Nothing to Show\\". Their debut is obviously greatly underappreciate not only by the fans, but even the rock critics. The material definately isn't the most accessible (which is pretty normal in the world of prog rock, to begin with, that's why 99% of music listeners are rather bewildered by that kind of music). Regardless, it's still quite a decent album, and forget what certain critics or Supertramp fans might say of this album because it's quite good.
0684830515|3.0|My opinion on this book is that it was not bad but yet not what i expected it to be at all.  This movie was basically about sex, violence, drinking, and many love affairs.  Personally I would say that many people can relate to this book because it is exactly most people's lives today.<br />   Hemingway is an exceptional writer.  I do like some of his work.  This book was based on his life.  All of his love affairs, how much he loved to drink and violence that he had gone through (the wars).  It is interesting how a person could just sit down and write about his life for the world to read.

B000021Y77|5.0|Luckily I caught this one on IFC today.  I think I'll buy the DVD.  One fun ride from beginning to end, end, end.  Run Lola reminds me of Magnolia but without the religious baggage.  Lola offers what the disappointing Magnolia failed to provide.  Magnolia's problems were many among which were length, superfluous dialogue, and characters for whom I felt no sympathy.  Lola, however, minimizes dialogue yet you are compelled to sympathize, and even root for, the otherwise despicable protagonists and the average bystanders whose time critical paths cross randomly.  What if you hit the snooze button on your alarm just one more or one less time tomorrow morning?  What will happen...or not?  Will it be a joyous or fatal decision?  Every moment is fleeting and life really is a roll on the roulette table, so enjoy it to the fullest.  Take note Hollywood.  Great filmmaking has nothing to do with big budgets.  It starts with the script.

B0000004F9|5.0|in rock, it WAS Soft Machine (their piece Dada Was Here from Volume 2, most likely was no accident) though \\"supreme egoism\\" is replaced rather by extreme egocentrism (which is not unusual in rock and varies only by level) and total disregard for the audience (at least it applies to their first two records). In case of Soft Machine, it resulted in absolute artistic freedom, they don't strive for perfection in the usual sense of it, some of the things they do appear to be unfinished, but in fact this is their forte. Take the titles of their albums: Volume1, Volume 2, Third, Fourth, 5, 6... it's not a display of originality, it's why-waste-time-on-inventing-a-fancy-title-when-there-are-more-important-things-to-do. Same with their music: it may seem to be raw and incomplete in spots, but it's more like waste-no-time. It sounds very improvisational, but even if it's not, they play it that way. Unquestionably excellent musicians, they sandwich pretty complex compositions between some seemingly simple ones as though they just laugh at you, but the point is how they play it. Besides, what critics called \\"good humor\\" is rather jest. So at first listen, reaction may be quite negative, especially after following a repetitive line in We Did It Again for a few minutes.  Definitely, it requires a few tries to start making sense out of it and don't take it personally, their approach could be described as let's-play-and-see-what-happens, they play it for themselves and if you like it you can go along.  Volume 1 is very good and highly recommended.     Volume 2 is an excellent jazz-rock record, in my view better than Volume 1, and the interesting part is that it can't be split into separate tracks, it's a whole thing, must be heard in its entirety. Plenty of jest as in Volume 1.  It starts with jest, both Pataphysical Introduction and British Alphabet (how about the alphabet in reverse in Part II) are just that but they are great and fun. Hibou Anemone and Bear is great, and so is Dada (do they really sing in Italian or it's another joke?) and He Lies Perfectly Still though the latter two are more like songs. Fire Engine is an avant-garde crap (too much of avant-garde in Out Of Tunes too) but it doesn't spoil the feast and is followed by Pig (great), Orange Skin (excellent, take the repeating two notes as the rhythm section and listen to the real action behind it), Door Opens (brilliant) and 10.30 (what a mix of everything!).  It needs a few listens to get to it but when you're through with it you will love them. Volume 2 is their most free-spirited record.

6301966015|4.0|I liked this film overall; although it moves very slow [for a 1960s film] and if you are not in the mood, can be boring, especially to younger audiences. I appreciated what seemed to me to be deliberate \\"low-key\\" acting styles to simulate a realistic movie-watching experience, but at times certain characters' actions seemed inappropriate to what was happening around them.<BR>Although it was filmed in England, Blow-Up feels very much like a foreign language film. It's almost peculiar at times that the dialogue does not require subtitles, beacuse it often feels as though it should, even though the characters are English. <br />The film is extremely well cast. David Hemmings is brilliantly cast in the role of a free-lance photographer and swinging Londoner about town. He's the right age, he's got the right look, and he's so believable in his role as to make it almost impossible to tell where the actor's true identity ends and the character acting begins. Yet he's totally believable in this role, he's good-looking, but also unique looking enough as to seem like a \\"real\\" person in a \\"real\\" environment living \\"real\\" scenarios.<br />I will give big points to a genuine effort to make a unique film here. This is definately not one of your typical \\"formula films\\" of today! It did manage to hold my interest throughout, although I'm still not entirely sure what this film is about, and I have a hunch that some of it is another example of \\"The Emporer's New Clothes\\", which is why I can only give this movie 4 stars. <br />This film was highly influential in it's day and I do recommend it to any fan of 60's culture and art films in general; especially for a rare chance to see both Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck performing together in this short-lived lineup of the Yardbirds.<br />This film is usually considered Michelangelo Antonioni's best film, although I disagree. I feel that \\"L'Avventura\\" is his masterpiece. But I must ask - why is this film not available in a DVD version yet? I can't believe that. C'mon Criterion - get on it!
B000063UR2|5.0|C'mon Ridley... I barely made it through the film. The DVD set is definitely worth the purchase, but the director's cut is only worthwhile as a study. I don't understand you whom give praise to the original. I am usually a fan of the \\"original masterpiece,\\" but for any of us millions of kids out there who grew up on Legend and fell in love with Mia Sara and for years to come would catch a bit of Legend on TV, and relive these childlike imaginative moments found only in our dreams, this other version is boring. The score completely distanced me from the film. I completely respect Jerry Goldsmith, but it came across as a seperate entity, not part of the film. As soon as I turned on the US version with the Tangerine Dream score I was transported right back in my childhood. I'd say that this was just due to nostalgia, but first-time viewers of the film agreed with me as well. Just after watching one scene, the consensus was that the TD score and the pacing of the US version just work better. This is a children's movie, correct? The pacing in the director's cut is way too slow. I had to struggle to stay awake. Admittedly, the ending of the US version is very cheesy, but is a cheesy ending always bad? I'd rather sit back and float through a magical fantasy world than stare impatiently as a seemingly endless stream of long drawn out scenes drags across the screen.
0783225903|4.0|Sam is a character that i can really relate to. He is obsessed with finding his dream. The truck driving woman is just the down to earth person to take this dreamer back to reality however. How funny that the embodiment of a dream can lead back to reality. <br /> The cameo appearance by Robert Deniro is quite amusing. Not to mention the scene of Sam's mother having her face lift. It is always good to have a good laugh. If only this woman would stop meddling in his life, Sam believes that, then, things would get better. He can't seem to forgo his promotion to information retrieval however so things will continue on as they are. And then comes his dream woman as he figures out the common sense solution to his bosses bureaucratic problem. But before he meets this truck driving lady. He has to bring a check to a horribly distraught woman and ask for her signature. She is the man's next of kin. Well Tuttle or Buttle something like that is his name. The typewriter seemed to have been unsure and had a bug. Of course signing on the dotted line as the woman takes the check is always a dramatic event and central to the theme of the movie. This poor widow only wants to know what has happened to the body of her husband.<br /> Other then that, I have to level with you. This film left me totally baffled despite multiple viewing. BUT, that is what i liked so much about it. Other then the few aforementioned scenes I never knew what i was looking at when i was watching the film. BUT, that made me feel like i was walking through an art gallery. And that was only enforced by the previous reviewers comment of the film being Avant Garde.<br />As in any gallery i ask myself, 'What work will be timeless?' I'd like to think that this film will be. It was off to a good start when they opened up with 'Somewhere in the 20th Century'. However i think they might have said 'Somewhere in Modern times'. After all, hey!, this movie was from the 80s in England and it did not seem too outdated to meeven now in the 21st Century. Surely we can all relate to that continuous mention of the dreaded 't' word that continued to crop up in the film. In this case however good and bad were not so clearly delineated. The rogue air conditioning repairman seemed like a bad guy but he sure was able to help things out. And once again when our main character is rescued from a terrible situation of near torture the bad guys seem quite useful. <br />All in all the film is quite entertaining and I'm glad i saw it in the 80's and once again now on the new dvd format. The 80s did seem like a much gentler time however, so maybe the film is better off watched in this, 21st Century. Kudos and contiued Kudos to Gilliam and i may try to see more of this persons' films.

B00005LMBK|3.0|The previous reviewer asks the question, \\"Does Damon Albarn ever sleep?\\" Well he seems to be doing a good job of it here. Hype and creative animated visuals aside, the music simply doesn't hold up as a complete listen aside from a few great moments. And, not surprisingly, those brilliant moments happen to be the singles Clint Eastwood and 19-2000, so you're not missing much. \\"Songs\\" like Latin Simone and M1A1 are somewhat humorous after the first listen, until you realize you've plunked down [item price] for this CD. Albarn has to be one of the most frustrating musicians around today. We all know he's capable of great things, but he seems more content to indulge in pretentious, self-indulgent, jerking off than putting together any sort of consistently brilliant music (Blur's The Great Escape is the closest he's ever come, IMO, and even that pales in comparison to truly great pop artists).<br />Buy the singles and forget the album.
0140186395|3.0|East of Eden has so much potential to be a book which has more of a satisfactory impact. This book, was at times poorly written, contradictory, confusing, and unfortunately boring. I say the book was poorly written at times because John Steinbeck spent so much time writing this book (several years I believe) and he could not manage to create many characters which interested me. Also, he included too many characters which were not important to the novel and even makes it unclear who the narrator is in the novel. I think the book is somewhat hypocritical because the novel's emphasis on freewill as one of its themes is not expressed through all the characters. Cathy Ames for instance, is condemmned as a devil during the entire course of the novel. How can you claim that freewill exists, and then permanently condemn one of your characters to a satanic status? I think that makes the book boring because it causes the plot to be too predictable, and at some points dry and corny. I am not saying that this book was completely awful though. The three stars I gave were for, the decent character development of Charles, and the insightful amorphisms provided by Lee, the Chinese servant of Adam. Also, Steinbeck's development of Cathy also had its strong points, but overall, I was disappointed at the way many character's dealt with their dilemmas. At times I was left feeling jipped at the outcome, or craving for more than what was provided. Overall, the book has strong themes, and a sufficient plot, but is hindered by its poor organization and mild character development.
B00005LQ04|5.0|I first discovered \\"Suspiria\\" on French TV ; I loved it, and although it was not my Argento's favorite, I decided to purchase this limited-edition (mainly because it included the soundtrack...

The transfer is -- let's say the word -- a masterpiece, and the beautiful rendition of the colour effects and camera work are fantastic, almost a miracle ! But most af all, this version is uncensored. I thought French version was complete (which was the case for \\"Deep red\\", for instance) ! How nave ! All the killings were partially cut ; believe me, for those who knew what can now be called \\"the old version\\", the end of the first murder is an astounding and perverse surprise ! To conclude, I'd congratulate Anchor Bay for their great work and their respectfull and delicate treatment of that cult movie. The extras are great, and the box set also contains stills... I love stills... Don't miss this one, you could be very sad...

0142000655|3.0|Steinbeck's heart-fulfilling allegory to the biblical story of Cain and Abel demonstrates the qualities and emotions of what it is to be human.  The tension, jealousy, and agony are portrayed through characters who make up the entire spectrum of human characteristics.  It is a tale of the emotional drama that persists within a family will leave readers engaged.  East of Eden will take the reader on an emotional journey because it provokes thought and opinion, making it a piece hard to put down.  The language of the novel is like an art which gives literal subjects an unique meaning and interpretation.  Each character shows a part of human nature.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I am a fan of Altman's work, so going into the film \\"Gosford Park,\\" if nothing else, I expected to be entertained.  Much to my surprise, not only was this a funny look at class structure in the 30s, but this is Altman's best film since MASH, which he made more than 30 YEARS AGO.  Altman seems to be getting better with age.  In my opinion, Altman and not Howard should have won an Oscar last year, let alone two.  If he had it wouldn't have necessarily been a career award even though it probably would have viewed that way.  This film was THE BEST FILM of 2001.<br />  I have always respected Altman for doing challenging, and interesting projects, but not necessarily box office friendly ones.  This was, however, one of the rare cases in which a few people went to see a good movie in the theater.  The success of the film is due to the impeccable acting in the film, a credit to Altman and the talented cast, which includes: Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Clive Owen, Michael Gambon, and Emily Watson just to name a few.  But I am forgetting to mention the outstanding Oscar winning script, by first-time writer Julian Fellowes, based on an idea by Altman and Bob Balaban, who oddly enough has become one of my favorite actors.  Balaban was in my two favorite movies last year, \\"Gosford Park\\" and \\"Ghost World.\\"<br />  Altman is one of my favorite directors of all time because he is a talented man who takes on interesting subject matter, and injects it with a visual style that is very unique.  The opening shot of \\"Gosford Park\\" is impressive, in that it is a continous shot introducing all of these great characters within this one setting.  Most of film takes place at a large mansion.  The fluid camera movement through the mansion catching these characters in the middle of their conversations in the very beginning of the film set the tone of the film very well.  This is a technique he used, to great effect, in \\"The Player.\\"

6305535264|4.0|John Barry and Stanley Donen's misunderstood sci-fi brainchild was panned on initial release, but happily is coming under re-evaluation in a later age.<br />Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett run a hydroponics lab on Saturn's third moon, Titan, which helps feed an overcrowded and progressively more sociopathic Earth.  Douglas and Fawcett are \\"paired,\\" though not actually married (or at least it is never understood that they are), she being an innocent naif who has never seen Earth and lived virtually her entire life with him, and he a disillusioned older man who never desires to see Earth again  -  though he encourages her to visit their home planet one day, if for no other reason than to further Fawcett's natural development.<br />Earth has decided that Douglas will soon be \\"obsolete,\\" and sends captain Harvey Keitel to assemble a robot to eventually run Saturn 3.  Keitel, however, is actually an impostor  -  he was washed out of the robot programming division because he was \\"potentially unstable,\\" and, proving the point, murdered the man given the assignment in order to take his place.  The reason is never stated, but the implication is strongly present  -  given his immediate fascination with Fawcett  -  that he wanted the assignment in order to be closer to her.<br />The robot  -  \\"Adam\\"  -  has a human brain, directly programmed by Keitel.  Since Keitel is a homicidal psychopath...well, you get the picture.  It isn't long before Saturn 3 becomes a battleground for supremacy with a mad metal titan.<br />This is really a great movie, if flawed.  The ending is too abrupt.  Douglas sometimes seems uncomfortable in his role, or acts as if he is in a different movie than Keitel and Fawcett.  The special effects are uneven, though generally pretty impressive.<br />But the script is solid and the suspense never lets up.  The action is pretty gripping, shooting out of a gun from the first scene, when Keitel coldly murders the astronaut whose place he is taking by flushinghim out into space.  The production is gorgeous, and unified.  The sets are beautiful, and incredibly colorful.  The matte shots for space and Saturn hearken back to 1950's pulp magazine covers.  The costuming is futuristic, but functional.  And the robot, Adam, is a nightmare out of Leonardo da Vinci's sketchbooks of human anatomy.  The terrific music score, by Elmer Bernstein, is mechanistically haunting.<br />A great movie it isn't, but it is very good.  There is a nice undercurrent of human feeling to this film, which is emphasized by the contrast of the warm and loving relationship between Douglas and Fawcett with the predatory intrusion of the coldly sociopathic Keitel.<br />This is wonderful sci-fi pulp, and if that's what you're in the mood for, you won't be disappointed.
0140067477|3.0|Overall, &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot; is a good introduction to Taoism, and some of its chapters are extremely well-written. I was disappointed, however, when the book began heavily criticizing other philosophies, specifically those personified by Rabbit, Eeyore, and Owl. I don't see Taoism as being that intolerant, or unable to see the wisdom and logic of other theories. I think this would have been a much better book if it had focused on what Taoism *is,* instead of what it is *not.*

0671027573|5.0|I normally don't write reviews becuase I never know what to say but this book was so good I had to write something. I have read a couple of other books by Linda Howard but this was the best yet. I don't remember ever reading a mystery book that kept me laughing throughout the whole book. Although all the charecters where pretty good, I enjoyed Jaine and her sassy attitude the best not to mention the good looking detective. I really hope that Ms. Howard writes a sequel to Mr. Perfect with the original living charecters. I highly recommend this book!!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Personally, I loved the movie, but I know most people didn't, so I'll review why you SHOULD buy this DVD.<br />The best feature is a documentary about how they made the film. It is over an hour long, and is well worth the price of the dvd...just that one feature. There are many other documentaries (4 that run around 8 minutes each), which are very interesting to watch.<br />Those who hate the movie -- watch it one or two times on the DVD. You will begin to realize that Jar Jar Binks really isn't in the movie that much. You will warm u pto it, and end up loving the movie.<br />Buy this DVD.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED A CHILD'S VIDEO GAME!!!!<br />DISK 1:  5 stars.  My entire family, from 8 yr old to 46 yr old parents, loved this movie.<br />DISK 2:  ZERO STARS.  When we heard this would be a 2-disk set, we had visions of behind the scenes documentaries, pieces on special effects, make up, locations used, etc.  WE GET NONE OF THIS!!!  JUST A FRUSTRATING, STUPID GAME!!<br />Look at Star Wars I, Planet of the Apes:  they appealed to a wide audience, and the 2 disk DVD gives us gobs of good stuff.<br />I am horribly disappointed by this release.
B00004YYDI|5.0|The movie consists of a blend of different elements to provide the best movie ever.  People who have never watched the movie know it contains violence but it also has drama and comedy.  Rarely does a movie express so much.  The movie is not just for males like most of the movies like it.  Everybody can sit down and enjoy.  The extra 24 minutes are marvelous.  They add to the love story which comes to an ultimate climax.
B00003CXRP|4.0|This is not an adventure story this is a subtle drama of a man left to himself and survival.  Nothing much happens in the movie we just get to watch how he survives and grows through some of the most unusual circumstances.  You'll probably find yourself trying to help him make decisions. It's fun; just don't expect the wrong thing.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Even twenty years after its original release, I am an unapologetic fan of Tron. This story of a programmer's unexpected absorption into a powerful computer system was an exciting visual and metaphoric journey. I think it had great effects and a terrific story, and this 20th anniversary edition DVD does justice to the film. It looks great, sounds great, and there are enough extras to keep you busy for over five hours.<br /><br />Supplemental material includes an hour-and-a-half documentary, &#34;The Making of Tron&#34;, with commentary by the actors and artists; audio commentary by the director, producer, associate producer and visual effects supervisors; two interesting deleted love scenes and deleted prologue text; early development features, including video tests and concept art; demonstrations of backlight animation and digital imagery; two scenes with music (where music was not used in the final film); publicity trailers, stills and merchandise, including clothing, toys and games; design features about the &#34;programs&#34;, vehicles and electronic world; storyboard to film comparison and storyboard artwork; and previews for Disney's Return to Neverland and Atlantis.<br /><br />This two-disc set is a terrific tribute to a groundbreaking movie, and even die-hard fans will find enough DVD extras to satisfy. Greatly appreciated and highly recommended.
B00005YU1O|4.0|Sure, Waking Life is a mind-numbingly pretentious excursion into pseudo-intellectual territory -- or so you may think.  For most of the film, I was sure I was laughing AT it.  That is, until the last fifteen minutes or so, when it surprisingly turns out to be as profound as it's been pretending.  Suddenly the monologues, ravings and bull has a point: representing all our human theories about life, death, and dream, they eventually fall away and become negligible.  The animation hightens the unreal feeling of what had to be a surreal film even in live-action, and allows the viewer (if willing) to accept the central conceit that makes it all worthwhile; or, at the very least, to keep us laughing derisively until the last reel blows us away.  That, I say, is what makes a good film.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|The first scene makes it clear that Lara is in no danger, and she remains in no danger throughout the movie.  This is 90% of the plot, and the rest is even less worthy of discussion.
0142000655|5.0|I enjoyed East of Eden immensely. Not only was it a very entertaining read, it was also very enriching. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, it is beneficial for the reader to be knowledgeable about the Bible (specifically the book of Genesis) prior to reading this book. It is the type of book that, after finishing it, will make you just sit and reflect. It offers a lot of insight on human nature, focusing on the potential for good and evil in everyone.<br />The struggle between good and evil is the dominant theme in this book. Steinbeck talks of the choice that everyone has to be either good (represented by the character Adam) or evil (represented by Cathy). The cast of characters is one of the best developed and most interesting I have ever encountered in a novel. All the characters have a purpose and bring the story to life. I highly recommend this book. You will not regret reading it.
B000001FAW|5.0|When it comes to the Bee Gees' music from the 70's, it doesn't get much better than \\"Children of the World\\". At the beginning of 1976, the Bee Gees were facing a potentially disastrous problem. Due to record company difficulties, the assistance of Arif Mardin (the Bee Gees' producer for the brilliant \\"Main Course\\" album) would no longer be available. Arif told the Bee Gees, who were nearly in a state of panic, that they could do it on their own. The result was phenomenal. Right off the bat, the Bee Gees released the irresistibly funky \\"You Should Be Dancing\\", which skyrocketed to # 1 during the summer of 1976. Another top 3 hit, \\"Love So Right\\", followed (A BEAUTIFUL falsetto lead by Barry) and the top 15 hit, \\"Boogie Child\\" after that. Even the non-hits off of the album are fantastic, too. \\"Children of the World\\" is one of the few albums where almost every song is memorable. My favorite is the Blue Weaver co-written ballad \\"The Way It Was\\". The production and the piano work are remarkable, along with the incredible non-falsetto Barry lead and signature Bee Gees harmonies. Other outstanding tracks include \\"You Stepped Into My Life\\", \\"Lovers\\", \\"Love Me\\", \\"Subway\\" and \\"Children of the World\\". This is the perfect album for any new Bee Gees fan or for anyone just interested in hearing some of the finest music made in the 70's. \\"Children of the World\\" is perhaps one of the finest Bee Gees albums in terms of the outstanding vocal performances, production work, and songwriting ability, and it will easily remain a favorite amongst Bee Gees fans, young and old alike.
0066620694|5.0|Great book. Highly recommended reading on why large technology companies are often unable to win against startups.<br />Also recommended: 'The Slingshot Syndrome: Why America's Leading Technology Firms Fail at Innovation' by Reid M. Watts
B000001EYW|5.0|Out of the four albums released by the Bee Gees during the 90's, I must say that \\"Still Waters\\" is possibly the best. As the biggest hit for the Bee Gees since the \\"Spirits Having Flown\\" album in 1979, \\"Still Waters\\" was huge. Released in the year where the Bee Gees were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, picked up numerous lifetime achievement awards around the globe, and kicked off the first of the One Night Only world tour shows, the album peaked at number 11 on the US charts and number 2 on the British charts, and contained three top twenty singles: \\"Alone\\", \\"Still Waters (Run Deep)\\" and \\"I Could Not Love You More\\". This album was literally what the Bee Gees needed to boost their popularity in the US in 1997. Apart from the three hit singles, the whole album contains a large amount of commonly overlooked gems. \\"I Surrender\\", which was almost (and should've been) released as a fourth single, is my favorite track. Also outstanding is the ballad, \\"My Lover's Prayer\\". Barry's clear vocal range is apparent as he switches from his amazing non-falsetto lead in the verses to the falsetto driven harmonies during the chorus. \\"Irresistible Force\\" and \\"Closer Than Close\\" are the first two Robin and Maurice leads of the album. \\"Irresistible Force\\" is a fantastic song performed by Robin, with an almost 80's flavor to it, while \\"Closer Than Close\\" is an enjoyable track; a true favorite amid the Maurice Gibb fans. An instant Bee Gees classic, \\"I Will\\" is a wonderful song, beautifully sung by Robin. All in all, \\"Still Waters\\" is a great effort from the Bee Gees. As an instant favorite with fans, and an enormous chart buster around the world, \\"Still Waters\\" exceeded everyone's expectations. Great job with this one, Barry, Robin, and Mo!
0066620996|5.0|If you are wondering what makes some companies succeed when other fail miserably, read this book. It will fill in at least part of the answer to the puzzle.

B000001FG5|5.0|The year is 1979. \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" is still dominating the airwaves, and the Bee Gees are about the biggest band on the planet. Not wanting to lose the momentum, they head into the studio to create the post-Fever album, \\"Spirits Having Flown\\". Considered to be the most pressure-filled time that they had ever experienced in their lives, the album was an enormous success. The three number one hits \\"Too Much Heaven\\", \\"Tragedy\\" and \\"Love You Inside and Out\\" made the Bee Gees the only recording artists to have written and produced six straight number one singles in a row - A feat still held today. Because of their perfectionist attitude, the Bee Gees created an album full of could-be-hit singles. Although not embraced by some fans because of the use of falsetto during almost every song, \\"Spirits Having Flown\\" is truly one of the better albums that the Bee Gees have ever released. It's incredibly easy to lose yourself in the distinctive, but beautiful falsetto voices in \\"ballads\\" like \\"Reaching Out\\" and \\"Until\\", and in the easy-going pop songs such as \\"Living Together\\", \\"I'm Satisfied\\" and \\"Search, Find\\". Ironically enough, one of the best tracks on the record is the title track, \\"Spirits Having Flown\\", which happens to be one of the only non-falsetto leads on the album. Eventually released as a single, \\"Spirits Having Flown\\" has an amazing lead vocal by Barry to go along with the irresistible \\"island\\" beat. Unfortunately, the single was released during the disco backlash days, and made very little impact on the charts.  Not surprisingly, the album has become the biggest selling LP of the Bee Gees' career, selling over 16 million copies. In Barry Gibb's words, \\"This is a total listener's album. Well, if you can stand the falsettos, that is...\\" If you can get past the falsetto, then you're in for a truly wonderful musical experience.
078401213X|1.0|How dare they use the term &quot;Number Theory&quot; in this movie?!?!?!?  I'm outraged and insulted by the nonsense that numerology would be considered mathematics!  Pi is a number like any other number.  There are an infinite number of numbers with the same properties as pi.  So what would make pi any different?  That is the one that every student of basic geometry learns about and &quot;someone&quot; didn't do the research to bother to find out of the plot would make any sense to anyone who studied higher mathematics!
B00003CXI1|5.0|HIGH MARKS FOR CHRIS COLUMBUS. THE DIRECTOR HAS FINALLY BURIED THE SUCCESS OF HOME ALONE WITH A MUCH BETTER PIECE OF FILMMAKING. I HAVE NOT READ ANY HARRY POTTER BOOKS, BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THIS MOVIE NOT DOING THE BOOK JUSTICE. I THOUGHT THIS FILM WAS PURE MAGIC THAT ADULTS MIGHT ENJOY EVEN MORE THAN CHILDREN. I MUST SAY AFTER VIEWING THE MOVIE WITH A GROUP OF KIDS AGES RANGING 4-10, THE KIDS HAD MANY QUESTIONS. THE MATERIAL MAY BE A LIL' ABOVE CHILDREN UNDER 13. HOWEVER THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE YOUNGER KIDS DIDN'T LOVE THE MOVIE. ANY DVD COLLECTION WOULD LOOK BARE WITHOUT THIS ONE, SO ADD IT TO YOUR COLLECTION TODAY! I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT HARRY POTTER ADVENTURE.
6300217019|5.0|There are very few movies that turn a woman on so much.  Most movies about sex show it as agressive, this is the exception: a story about a man who wants to make women climax.  Gere sizzles in every sex scene. But aren't some of those scenes clipped inthe video?
B00005OAIE|4.0|My wife and I heard \\"No Such Thing\\" on the radio, one of the stations that is contractually bound never to tell you who just sang that song you like. I finally learned that the guy's name was Mayer and checked out samples as well as the views of my fellow Amazon types. I like it. I do not totally agree with the Dave Matthews comparison. No one sounds like Dave because Dave seems to have been influenced by everyone except the old guy in Florida who packages boy bands. There is a similarity in vocal style. Neither one has great pipes, and both use a \\"breathy\\" delivery. The reviewer who mentioned Michael Franks is much closer in my opinion. This is interesting to me, because Franks' career had basically come and gone by the time Mayer would have been open to \\"influences\\". Maybe it shows just how good Franks' \\"Sleeping Gypsy\\" really is. While you're here, buy a copy!<br />There is a bit of sameness to the songs, but Lennon and McCartney took a while to hit their stride, and they were gods, or so we are told. The music is fun, the lyrics are better than you have read here and I love the implied challenge: you live your life to meet other's expectations, I'll pursue my own dreams and we'll get back together in ten years to compare notes. <br />The more I listen, the more I enjoy it. If you have even the slightest appreciation for jazzy folk-rock, this is a keeper.
0800129806|4.0|This movie was definately entertaining.  The story does move too far from the tradition of King Arthur for my taste, and yet the question remains whether it could be done with out the Athurian Legend.  The movie is well rounded and entertaining.  Gere does not do justice to the characte of Lancelot, but it was not just his acting.  Lancelot is protrayed as just an ordinary rogue who happens to become a knight of the round table by accident, and not chivalry.  If you can get passed this, then the movie has good action scenes and is definately worth watching.
6300214354|5.0|One of Val Kilmer's early performances. Top secret is a perfect movie if you're a fan of films like Airplane or the Naked Gun series. It's stupid but funny stupid.
B00005QATY|5.0|O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a delightful tale of three convicts escape from prison in search of \\"hidden treasure.\\"  The movie is set on a back drop of bluegrass music from the 20s, 30s, and 40s which bring the story to life.  Although the characters are fairly stereotypical, they have a life of there own.  Many hidden suprises await both the convicts and the viewers on their journey.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is my FAVORITE band.Chester's vocal is very powerful and Mike is the best rapper I've ever seen.Their music style is so \\"hybrid\\" that it really surprises me and change my point of view of rock music.Highly recommend this CD!!
1558908420|5.0|\\"Cop Land\\" is truly an Oscar-worthy film and Sylvester Stallone should have been nominated for portraying a quiet, local town sheriff. After saving a young woman when he was a teenager, he damaged his left ear losing all hearing. So, in present day, he does his job sluggishly and is peaceful. But, one day, a city police officer killed some young men thinking they had a weapon. He was mistaken and disappeared without a trace. Corrupted city cops covered for him, but he slowly came out in the open. Freddie Heflin (Stallone) investigated the matter and took it into his own hands... I was deeply astounded by Stallone's performance and the cast. Harvey Keitel is always sneaky, Ray Liotta is a riot and Robert DeNiro is always the man. This is truly an epic film with powerhouse performances that all cop dramas should follow.
B000063V8R|5.0|This is perhaps the best of all the seasons of every Star Trek.  Without a doubt, two episodes stand out as the best Star Trek has ever produced, and they are both included in this set.  \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" is a great tragedy that even Shakespeare would have been proud of.  The return of Tasha Yar is done excellently.  The ethics and conflicts involved are classic.  \\"The Best of Both Worlds Part 1\\" needs no introduction.  This episode shocked the television world with the greatest cliffhanger in T.V. history and a story that left people saying \\"they didn't just do that\\" or \\"they can't do that\\".  This episode set the trend for T.V. finales that most shows who copied this format failed miserably.  Nobody does it better than Star Trek, and none has been better than this episode.  This episode alone generated more speculation, more impatience, and more debate and discussion across the nation during one summer than any Star Wars movie could.  It kept people guessing for three months, including the writers, about the outcome.  These two episodes alone are worth the price.  Excellent acting, great stories, and nail-bitting suspense makes this season of Star Trek TNG the must have gift of the millennium.  I can't wait to get mine.
1558908846|5.0|All hail to Judge Dredd: Judge, Jury, and Genius! This movie revolutionized the world and is the best thing that ever happened to me since taking my first footsteps. Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante are comic geniuses. To much of my delight, they threw in Rob Schneider and Diane Lane. Ultra purity. From betrayal to retribution, this movie cleansed my mind, body and soul. Immortal!
B000021Y74|5.0|Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt) is one of the best European Alternative films to come out of the past decade. Directed and written by the great Tom Tykwer and starring Franka Potente (born exactly 10 years after me) this film starts out with a clock.  You sense you are about to go on a time trip, and soon you're in the race against time.  Incredible avant-garde cinematography mixed perfectly with cartoon animation focuses on Lola, a red-haired high energy time vortex.  She has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 marks all in the name of love.  If things dont go quite right it's okay, because here alternate reality comes into play ala the great Polish film Blind Chance (Przypadek by Kieslowski).  Profound questions are asked, and the film puts forth the idea that a butterfly (Lola) flapping its wings in Japan will effect American weather.  The quantum pure spontaneity of conscious decisions effect events at every Lola turn.<br /><br />  A great soundtrack drives it all and the whole film fits together perfectly.  A rare avant-garde success which is similar to and every equal of Aronofsky's Pi in significance.  Also captures the Berlin (I think that's where it is) atmosphere great; city chaos and freedom.  You must have a taste for the underground European avant-garde to really appreciate this.
0140186395|5.0|East of Eden, set in the rural areas of America during the early twentieth century, is a captivating novel exploring a person's struggle between what is good and evil. Steinbeck uses biblical references to enhance his ideas about basic human nature. With a foundation based on the story Cain and Abel, Steinbeck goes above and beyond and produces a variety of fully developed characters through his analysis of their outer and inner turmoil. Steinbeck establishes a moral spectrum of good and evil through his characters, and he effectively portrays how a balance good and evil is necessary to maintain order in a society.  <BR> I found it mesmerizing as the plot would thicken, which it continuously did, and was impressed by Steinbeck's thorough exploration of the mind and heart of an individual. I highly recommend reading this book.
B00006690F|2.0|I have a few problems with this album.  Obviously, Eminem is still the master of wordplay.  He still shines even though he is comparitively more tame than his last two albums. That aside. . .<br />It seems that the production has been slowly going downhill with each album.  By this, I am talking about being OVER produced.  There is nothing raw about this album at all.  I wouldn't be surprised if these bubble-gum sounding songs had the same producer as boy bands.  The same techniques are used, and Eminem is better than that.<br />The next problem . . . the choruses!  They are completely annoying and unneccesarily long!  You will be engrossed in what Eminem says in the verses and hate in the choruses.  Seriously, they feel like commercial breaks.  The worst being in the awful \\"My Dad's Going Crazy\\" album closer.  Basically, Eminem  lets his daughter sing the chorus, and it is THE MOST ANNOYING THING YOU WILL EVER HEAR!!!  As a closer, it leaves a sour taste in your mouth for the whole album.<br />This album doesn't feel earth shattering like his last two did.  I played his last two albums over and over,hearing something new in every listen.  I was ready to put away this album after two listens.  Simply put, Eminem needs some fresh perspective at the mixer controls.<br />Tony
B000066AXC|3.0|Yes, Ron Howard is a heck of a director.  And he's never better than in showing the difference between what's inside the mind of someone afflicted with schizophrenia, and the reality that everyone else sees.  Even I, a practicing psychiatrist, was surprised to discover that Howard/Crowe/Nash had been leading me down a primrose path to hell.  It's elegantly understated, very watchable, and completely accurate.  But it may be the only accurate thing in the film, which is completely misleading.<br />I haven't read Ms. Nasar's biography, which I understand is considerably more honest about Mr. Nash's life, so I do not blame her for this film.  The film is completely misleading. Mental illness is not like a cold that randomly affects some of us, who then take better care of our health and it goes away. Hallucinations can not be willed away.  Mr. Nash did not earn the Nobel Prize BECAUSE of some special creativity his disease gave him.  He did not even earn it THROUGH his psychiatric symptoms;  early in his disease, during (no doubt) a remission of his symptoms, the part of his brain not ravaged by the disease manifested it's greatness before schizophrenia made a mess of his life.  That came later, and fortunately he got treatment for it. But the disease remains.  <br />I fear people will watch this film and think, \\"Wow, you can have schizophrenia and still win the Nobel Prize!\\" And that thought is an insult to the victims of schizophrenia.  I include in those \\"victims\\" their family and friends, because their lives are devastated, too.  If you want to learn what mental illness is like (and not just what great film making is like,) watch \\"Niagra, Niagra.\\"  This is a film that shows the hell that untreated mental disease becomes for everyone involved . . . not a trip to Oslo.
B00001IVOR|5.0|This cd is definetly one of the greatest cds of all time.People who say they dont like this cd are dumb deaf and blind. like rza said , people wont feel this album till the year 2000.

B0000640VO|3.0|Though \\"Amelie\\" has great promise and filled many art house theaters with people, I found the movie to be a bit overrated.  While it does inspire a sense of joy, the movie never completely connected with me.  French screen ingenue Audrey Tautou was pleasant and the over-the-top visuals of acclaimed director Jean-Pierre Jeunet were inventive if not occasionally distracting.  In its favour, one must admit that the movie succeeds at its seeming purpose: to capture the essence love.  On the other hand , enjoying this film requires one to leave the brain at home and wear his or her heart on the sleeve.  <br />For a pure sense of wonderment with a deeper sense of purpose, I suggest the superior \\"Time Bandits\\" by Monty Python alum Terry Gilliam.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Bought and watched it, being a huge fan of the books.  The movie is FANTASTIC!  Then I went to find the 7 deleted scenes.  You have to navigate through endless childish games and play stupid puzzles to unlock them.  This is ridiculous!  All I wanted was to see the scenes, I bought it on DVD with that as the purpose, and here I am, over 45 minutes later, and I GIVE UP!  I still haven't seen the scenes, and I can't imagine any child who would sit long enough to play them all.  It gets so boring after the first 5 minutes.  And it's unbelievably difficult.  You have to click on EVERY SINGLE FEATURE!!  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!

B000067FP8|4.0|Anyone remember the theater scene in Gremlins 2 w/ Hulk Hogan that was in the actual theatrical release? I wonder if they'll include this scene on the DVD. The television broadcast has the Gremlins taking over a t.v. station and somehow they interact with a John Wayne Western instead.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Incredibly fresh, a progressive ( in lack of  a better word) sonic emotional blast. Melodically and harmonically heavenly inspired.  It's like listening to something that you've never heard before but  that sounds as something that you've been related to for long time . It is beautifully complex as that. If music is a subjective experience in itself, Sigur Ros extends this concept  to its limits what makes any review about their music an opinion not capable of reflecting a general feeling. Buy it and let your soul explain it to you in its own personal way. So good to know that there are people in the world capable of doing music like this.
0738206679|4.0|Updated 28 Dec 07 to add links.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this book.  On the one hand, it is coherent, thoughtful, and tells a story about the emerging science of networks that anyone, who can read, can understand.  This is a non-trivial accomplishment, so 4 stars.<br /><br />However, the book is also--being brilliantly designed to be understood by the lowest common denominator, an undergraduate--somewhat shallow and empty.... especially when compared with Stephen Wolfram's \\"A New Kind of Science\\", 1197 pages not counting the index, which is at the other extreme.<br /><br />Although there are good notes, there is no bibliography, and the author fails to use network methodology to illustrate and document the emerging literature on networks--called citation analysis, this would have been a superb appendix to the book that would have taken it up a notch in utility.<br /><br />Among the key points that the author discusses and which certainly make the book worth buying and reading, my above reservations not-with-standing:<br /><br />1)  Reductionism has driven 20th century science (and one might add, all other knowledge), with the result being that we have experts who know more and more about less and less--and )as CIA and FBI recently found)while leaving us devoid of generalists and multi-disciplinary artists and scientists who can \\"connect the dots\\" across these fragmented foci.<br /><br />2)  Contrary to the prevailing wisdom about networks being equally distributed and thus largely invulnerable to catastrophic meltdown, the author does a fine job of documenting the importance of selected \\"hubs\\", so important that their removal ultimately breaks the network down into isolated pieces.  The functionality of the network, its strength, is also its weakness--vulnerability to deliberate attack against the hubs (the author does not mention the Internet domain directories except in passing while discussing a table error, but MAYEAST and MAYWEST would be two obvious directory hubs that could be better protected through replication).<br /><br />3) The author inadvertently makes a vital contribution to our understanding of how to defend America against terrorism--discussing why no single authority can close down the Internet by fiat, he notes \\"The underlying network has become so distributed, decentralized and locally guarded that even such an ordinary task as getting a central map of it has become virtually impossible.\\"  LOCALLY GUARDED--this is the key phrase.  Federalizing counter-terrorism, and using federal agents and computers at the state and local levels, will not be effective against terrorists in civilian guise within the homeland--only a complete extension of counterintelligence and counterterrorism methods to the state & local level--teaching them to fish for terrorists, rather than trying to catch the terrorists with federal trawlers, is the way to go.<br /><br />4)  The author flirts with what is known as nomadic computing, making the point that nodes built around individual people are becoming as important--some would say more important--in a networked economy than nodes built around static organizations.

B000056V73|5.0|This movie goes to prove William Goldman's quote that in Hollywood \\"nobody knows anything\\" is true. This deservedly won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar but was pretty much ignored. Having finally gotten around to seeing it I must say that this is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. Cameron Crowe's autobiographical film about a young music journalist wannabe who ends up on the road with a rock band is truly brilliant. Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson and Patrick Fugit all give terrific perfomances,in fact the whole cast is excellent. Heartfelt, funny, sad, touching this is a must see. If you haven't seen it yet don't waste any more time. I guarantee you'll LOVE it.
B000067DNC|5.0|The minute I knew this DVD was coming out, I started putting away for it's purchase. While there are one or two mediocre episodes, what series can say every single episode is gold? The good far, far outweighs the bad here and it's well worth the price. The writing, the acting, everything about this series is top-notch. I can't wait until September!
B000002MP2|5.0|Everyone who was in high school during the 90's remembers (if not owned) this great album.  Every song is a fantastic song.  I personally listen to mostly classic rock from the 60's (beatles, Floyd, Jimi, etc..)  and still Billy is a great song writer.  I noticed a lot of bad reviews because they are to &quot;pop&quot; for some people's liking.  Rememeber even Kobain wrote a pop song which to this day is nirvan's biggest hit.  These guys are not pop, thats they're sound, and its a great sound at that.  True musical giants of the 90's.  If not for bands like Green Day, we'd be stuck listening to another boy band. Thank god they still make records for those who hate the music that for the last year have been heard on the radio.  This is a must buy!!
B00002E233|5.0|This movie is tied with The Matrix in my movie list. This and The Matrix are the best movies I've seen. The plot is geneous and the cast is great. It was a huge surprise when Samuel L. Jackson dies, but makes the movie scarier. One moment he's rattling on about the avalance and the next he's being ripped in half by the generation 2 Mako shark and a generation 1 Mako. If you have'nt seen the movie yet and are reading this sorry about spoiling that part. I won't spoil it anymore. This movie is a must see if you like intense horror movies about sharks. If you liked Jaws chances are you'll love this.
0679777547|3.0|I began this book expecting something great, but my expectations fell steadily as I read on and on -- and on and on -- until, at long last, I reached the mundane end of what was, at best, an average novel.  <br />Readers respond well to high-class mystery tales with literary themes.  Unfortunately, the author didn't have the imagination to come up with an extraordinary, unexpected, knockout conclusion. Instead, he hemmed and hawed for the last hundred or so pages while he tried desperately to find a satisfactory ending to the book -- and failed miserably. <br />The good points are that the book is well-written, the story line intriguing, and the mystery is mysterious enough to keep you reading -- albeit with increasing and well justified suspicion that the author has nothing to say and is saying so at great length. I'll give the book three stars because I learned something about Dumas and demonology and the antiquarian book trade.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Not just a great movie, Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge explodes on DVD, putting the format to great use with extra camera angles, alternate shots, commentary, bonus features, and more!
B00004TH7Z|4.0|This one is good; the best since \\"Seventh Son.\\"  Yes, I wish (like many) that Martin Birch would have produced this, although the vocals and drums came out real good.  The songs are excellent with \\"The Wicker Man,\\" \\"Dream of Mirrors,\\" and \\"Out of The Silent Planet\\" as the real standouts for me.  \\"Blood Brothers\\" is also very good with the triple time signature giving it a hint of celtic roots.  You can hear elements of past ideas from Piece of Mind, Somewhere in Time, and Seventh Son of A Seventh Son but it sounds up to date; it sounds like exactly where Iron Maiden should be right now.<br />Bruce Dickinson has never been better and that goes for Nicko McBrain as well - amazing.  It took me about two or three listens per song to appreciate what they are doing, but this is one of those albums that grows on you.  I listen to it all the time now.  This album is refreshing and really stands out, especially in light of the [quality of music] that is labeled \\"rock\\" right now.<br />The bottom line is this:  This album rocks and if you like Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son, you will like this. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the production could have been better.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Great plot, good symbolism, moving and some of the best Anime art that I have ever seen. The closing sequence is AMAZING! BTW, I love this movie so much I made a larger than life model of a character (a Kodama, or forest elf/fairy/spirit/gnome) and have a username as it.
B000001OAA|5.0|It's hard to believe that I've been a fan of Garbage since 1995 and that I'm only eighteen years old but it's true! This was actually the first CD I ever purchased and I played it non-stop for about a year. I just refused to listen to anything else because I was so taken by their guitar and keyboarding sound with loop-filled electronic rock that's experimental yet gritty.<br />I remember seeing the video for \\"Queer\\" with Shirley Manson walking around the streets with her hands beckoning the camera to follow. I was completely captivated, to say the least, for I had never seen anything quite like it before. I also think that this album helped me deal with my parents moving me around so much in such an early stage in my life. It was getting to the point of me finding it useless in making any friends. I strongly believe that this album helped me deal with a lonely time in my life.<br />I actually saw them live for [a] second time ... and it was really amazing. When they performed the silky ballad \\"Milk\\" it reminded me of this album and how much it meant to me. It seems that I'm always listening to VERSION 2.0 (which is my favorite album by them) or BEAUTIFULGARBAGE (because it's their newest). Either way, each individual album is an absolute pleasure to listen to. Garbage's unique style of postmodern technopop with dark, angst-laden lyrics will appeal to alternative, punk-rock, and even techno/electronic fans. They were the groundbreaking artists of their time and I truly believe that they are going to be creating great music for years to come.
0060090367|4.0|I would probably have given this book a five, but I read Sushi for Beginners, also by Keyes, right before Watermelon nad found it's writing to be a bit more tight and clean. I have heard Watermelon is one of her first works, and it is amazing debut if so! I was hooked from the first few pages.<br />I will not go into what the book is about because all one hundred and something reviews do so. <br />Claire, the protagonist, is a great character, someone I would love to be friends with. She is funny, intelligent, loyal, honest and witty. Her outlook on life is actually quite inspiring considering the relationship trauma she was put through. Her resiliency is amazing. I am hoping that Keyes either continues Claire's story at some points, or lets her readers know what has happened with her life in other books! <br />The men in Claire's life and her relationships as well as her new baby are the focal points of this book. Her maturity towards her baby is fantastic as she realizes despite her husband leaving her, the baby must come first. It is also fun to see Claire's inner battles as she experiences a new relationship. Her outlook is so healthy and fun! <br />Although this is a light, fluffy and fun read, it also manages to be deep and heartfelt. But Claire's sense of humor and wit manages to make the could-be-heavy scenarios less intense. This is a feel good novel that I would highly recommend. The Walsh family is a hoot, and I cannot wait to read more of Keyes books so that I can experience more of their zaniness and fun!<br />I plan to read all of Keyes books from this point onward, and will buy them in hardcover because I will not be able to wait for paperbacks! I might even have to go to Amazon.com.UK so I can get them sooner then they are released in the US.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This is my favorite Dylan album since &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;.  Witty narrative rolls off of Bob's tounge like gems from a pirate's bounty.  Does he even write these lyrics down?  After the excellent &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; I was worried Bob was sinking into a dark mire of bitterness and pain, the end seemed near.  But now he seems reborn  and fresh combining his sage venerable self (something he could do even in his twenties), with his youthful vigor.  What an icon.
B0000640SA|4.0|With 590 reviews out there, I'm sure someone has already revealed the great secret behind these &quot;mind-bending challenges&quot;, but I'm going to do it once again so it will be up front and easy to spot for all those frustrated kids. Plus I just figured it out myself and I feel like showing off. Okay here it is, the classic dilemma of making something much harder than it really is -- To access the special features on Disc 2 of the Memento Special Edition DVD set, choose one of the following icons: Binoculars (for Trailers), Globe (for International Art), Skull (for Anatomy Of A Scene), Clock (for Short Story), Book (for Director's Script) and the Math Compass Thing (for Stills, Sketches &amp; Journal). Once you've decided what feature you would like to access, simply select the corresponding icon and continue answering &quot;C&quot; for EVERY question. (Yes, even if you *do* hear voices ALWAYS and not OCCASIONALLY.) Sooner or later, but guaranteed to work, you will get to the feature you were looking for. There is a maze out there, sportsfan, so if you'd like to go wandering aimlessly, by all means do. But the most simple and effective way is taking the ol' straight &amp; narrow. Of course there are some hidden features that require a slightly different game plan. (For example, to watch the film chronologically, arrange the tire-fixing photos in reverse order when they come up on the &quot;Clock Test&quot;) In any case, this a great movie, and a..unique DVD. On the one hand, I think the menu design and test questions are interesting and fairly entertaining..at least the first couple times..and we shouldn't stifle creative designs like this one just because it gave us all a couple minutes (or sadly, hours) of angry desperation. On the other hand, it can be a little annoying when you wanna skip right to the meat &amp; potatoes; an off-switch for the brain-busters woulda been nice. Speaking of which, I'm flipping the off-switch on this amazing and mind-expanding review. Blah.
0875847706|4.0|This book reminds me of &quot;Who moved my cheese?&quot;, though it's relatively longer. With outstanding stories and practices, such as &quot;giving an A (to all those aspirational)&quot; and &quot;rule number six (dont take yourself so goddamn seriously)&quot;, the authors had put something important but easy to remember concepts into the readers mind, which certainly help them a lot in getting the right perspective/mind/means in dealing with most daily life problems. Can be a classic. Shouldnt be missed by those regular readers of self help/improvement books.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This has got to be one of the best CDs I have heard in a long time, her sound is so different than the cookie cutter artist out there!!  Norah's voice is both soothing and seductive at  the same time, if you don't get this cd then you are  missing out on an icredible listening experiance!!
B000001GQQ|5.0|Actually this 3rd piano concerto of Prokofiev is the best of the rest 4 piano concertos. Argerich was 26 years old when this magnificent performance is recorded. This exceptional work is performed by many pianists even reperformed by Argerich later but none of them is comperable this Argerich's referance performance. Very good.
B00005Y228|5.0|I'm not the biggest pop music fanatic in the world but for the past two months I've yet to remove Kylie's FEVER from my CD player.  I'm in love with this album.  The fun dance grooves don't stop which makes it a perfect summer driving disc.  &quot;Love at First Sight, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Dancefloor&quot; will make you dance in your seat and the title song, &quot;Fever,&quot; will, well, infect you.  I leave it on repeat AND workout to it.  Put Britney on the back burner and give Kylie a try.  Those Aussies and Brits know what they're doing.
B00005JKED|5.0|This was a great flick. Hands-down, it's the best work Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke have each done, respectively. Washington plays corrupt detective Alonzo with so much charisma, it is frighteningly convincing. This story (aided by the superb acting) is a perfect demonstration how charisma and strong personality can overwhelm those unsuspecting individuals who are in a \\"I look up to you\\" position. <br />The heart of the film is Ethan Hawke's portrayal which functions as a perfect counter to Washington's. Here, we see the idealistic young cop faced with the reality of the jaded, corrupt, and ultimately evil cop. As Alonzo uses his \\"training day\\" with Hoyt (Hawke) to serve his own needs, it becomes apparent to the viewer and to Hoyt, that he is being used like a pawn to serve a greater, sinister plan. It turns into a struggle for Hoyt's ideals and ultimate survival in the end.<br />Excellent film overall. Stunning and engrossing, it only gets better with repeated viewings.
B000063UR2|3.0|I have been a huge legend fan since I was 11 years old and have viewed the american cut upwards of 500 times.  Naturally, I have been excited for the last 2 years for this ultimate dvd, complete with director's cut, to FINALLY be released.  Now, I am delighted to own this fabulous fantasy in widescreen, with beautifully-restored color.  However, I must admit that I was severely disappointed with the extra material on the disc.  The director's commentary was so boring, it actually put me to sleep the first time!  Ridley has failed us in this money-making endeavor of re-release, especially after he made us wait so long for it.  His commentary lacks interest- and simply re-iterates  much of the information given in the 'making of' featurette, which also left much to be desired.  With the exception of a few wonderful, but short, interviews with some of the actors and crew, the featurette was dominated by Ridley Scott doing a lot of whining and complaining.  He is clearly insecure about this film, especially the american cut, which HE DECIDED to butcher; not the studio.  He actually goes so far as to blame marijuana for the ill-acceptance of Legend in america!- ironically, leading to HIS paranoia and the butchering of his own movie!  Anyway, the disc IS worth owning, if only for the wonderful Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack and the opportunity of experiencing Legend in glorious widescreen.  I only wish Mr. Scott had realized sooner that Legend was NEVER going to appeal to the mass public, but was to become a cult classic for a select few to treasure for many years to come.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I just watched A.I. for the second time, and my first time on DVD. Let me start by saying that is is a beautiful DVD. The clear and colorful photography is captured perfectly on this disk, and it looks as great on the smaller screen as it does on the big screen.<br />I liked this film a lot better the second time around. The first time I saw it I felt bored and annoyed with some of the sequences. The \\"Flesh Fair\\" sequence in particular was quite weak. I also disliked the obvious \\"real kid dislikes the fake kid\\" bit, and the \\"we have to get rid of the fake kid for the better good of the family\\" stuff. Although it is essential to the plot, it just seemed a bit too manufactured for me. <br />On the positive side, it is a thoughtful picture that is an interesting take on humanity's attitudes, prejudice, and the universal need for love. Jude Law and Haley Joel Osment are fantastic as individuals and as a team. Their chemistry is great. Visually, as I mentioned before, the film is a winner. It just looks absolutely beautiful. The sets, costumes, digital landscapes, and so forth are top-notch. <br />I guess it shouldn't have suprised me that critics and audiences in general bashed this film, in an era where a great picture like \\"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones\\" is not appreciated. I'm sure that there will be crusty, jaded, sci-fi fans that won't like \\"A.I.\\", but as with \\"Clones\\"...who wants to listen to that miserable bunch anyway???
B00006690F|5.0|when i got this amazing CD i just couldn´t stop listening to it. It´s a bit different from his last two CD´s. But different isn´t necessery a bad thing. It´s much more deep and meaningfull and that makes the CD a lot better, because you don´t get bored.<br />My faves songs are: Business, Hailie´s song, Without me, Sing for the moment,´Till i collapse, Cleaning out my closet & When the music stops. Rest of the songs are not bad but just not outstanders. They are \\"ONLY\\" great.<br />So if you are an Eminem fan i recommend you go out and buy this phenominal CD. Easily the best of 2002. Highly Recommended.

630179513X|5.0|This would be no doubt the best out of the excellent Back To The Future series. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd star in this rousing conclusion to the popular series from executive producer Stephen Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis.<BR>Stranded in 1955 after a freak burst of lightning, Marty must travel to 1885 to rescue Doc Brown from a premature end. Surviving an Indian attack and unfriendly townsfolk, Marty finds Doc Brown the blacksmith. But with Doc under the spell of the charming Clara Clayton, it's up to Marty to get them out of the wild west and back to the future. Back to the future 3 has got everything-action,laughs and romance in this grand finale to the blockbuster time-travel series.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This one albums has to go down as one of the greatest albums of all time. Lets just start with the fact that The Clash was not just some punk band from london (no that was the Sex Pistols). The Clash were extremley talented and played so many different kinds of music from rock to reggae to ska to urban to even gospel. and they covered a lot of that ground on this album. sure the Sex pistols may have been the trail blazer but The Clash (and this album) paved the road and set some really high standards. this album still stands the test of time today. many many bands try to copy it's unique sound (you know who you are RANCID) and are influenced buy it.
0066620996|5.0|While I am only a student merely begining his entrepenuerial studies, I would recomend this book to anyone looking to gain a true insight into how some of the greatest companies of our time have managed to become so succesful. This book is interesting and provides case studies on how certain corporations, mainly 11 very succesful ones, combine leadership and forseight to maitain success for many years. The eleven companies were selected on very strict parameters and ones that have not only achieved success but have also maintained it. I recomend this book to anyone within the business community. It can help all people and companies achieve greater success.
B0000399WI|2.0|This may be my all time favorite film, which is why I have the most trouble understanding why it recieved only minimal treatment in the DVD format. With all the great &quot;Special Editions&quot; and &quot;Criterion Collection&quot; films that have come out, films that are worthy of true in-depth exploration, why hasn't Shawshank gotten its proper DVD release for the people who love this film. I try to get the most for my DVD dollar, and love DVD's for the &quot;behind the scenes&quot;, &quot;making of&quot;, &quot;directors/actors commentary&quot; &quot;alternate endings&quot;, &quot;storyboards&quot; special features. Shawshank doesn't have any of these to speak of....just production stills and trailer. This edition is really a glorified VHS copy, and that is a true shame....a big let-down for me.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I don't need to address the merits of the movie itself -- everyone knows it's great, and if you're reading this you've probably seen it anyway.  The issue here is to review the way the movie is \\"packaged\\" into a DVD for consumers to buy.  Sadly, whatever marketing genius was put in charge of this important project failed miserably -- the extra disc, which contains all the \\"Special Features\\" is a classic example of \\"let's show how clever our DVD product engineers are, and let's ignore any consideration of user-friendliness and user enjoyment\\".  The entire 2nd disc is, for want of a better term, a video game, where you have to spend hours digging around and running repeatedly against frustrating dead ends, in order to actually \\"see\\" anything.  I have 2 kids, ages 8 and 10, both highly intelligent and video-game literate, and they both expressed their frustration at the false starts, the blind alleys, and the overall lack of \\"entertainment\\" throughout this whole 2nd disc.  It's really a pity -- they had an entire DVD's worth of digital storage capacity into which they could have packed truly useful and entertaining things -- interviews with the 3 child actors (there are none, anywhere), bloopers (whouldn't that have been great?) and in addition, some sort of on-the-side interactive video game which was not so full of inconsistencies and frustrating dead ends.  Did anyone at the production company actually audience-test this package (including all age groups) before producing the final product??  I can't possibly believe that they did.  Great movie, but extremely disappointing and frustrating DVD...
B00004ZAV3|5.0|If you like the Beatles, you have to get this CD. It's got all of the #1 songs and the sound quality is great. This is one of those CD's that you won't want to skip around, looking for a good song (like I usually do). I always put this on from beginning to end, because every song is good. Even if you didn't grow up in the Beatle era, you should get this CD to see what the Beatles were all about. I've got all of the Beatles's CD's, but this one is my favorite.
0142000655|4.0|East of Eden provides a interesting reading experience and never fails to suprise. The characters are all very complex and change throughout the story.  It is about two families, the Trask's and the Hamilton's whose path meet in the Salinas Valley of California.  East of Eden also parallels the biblical story of Cain and Abel.  The rivalry between Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb directly parallels this story, the only difference being that Aron and Caleb (Adam's children) manage to resolve thier rivalry with each other.  Cathy represents the evil character while Adam is the Ultimate good.  Adam starts off very naive and gets taken advantage of by Cathy; and not until later does he finally become more aware and sees what Cathy really is.  A theme in this novel is the need to be loved. Charles and Caleb, both feel that thier father's do not love them and this creates an extreme jealousy of Adam and Aron respectively.
B00006690F|5.0|I think this is the best Eminem album to date! The other ones were good but this one kicks all their butts. in this CD the lyrics actually have more meaning and are a lot more insightful. I think his skills have gotten a lot better. My favorite songs are( even though all of them are kick [rear])White america,business,cleaning out my closet,soldier,goodbye hollywood,hailie's song,and Till i collapse. Out of all of these my favorite would be \\"leaning out my closet\\" because the lyrics are so strong. The first time i put this into my cd player I was like,\\" whoa, this is kick-[rear]! You should go out and buy thi scd now. It comes with a cool dvd too. It's got a cool performance with Marylin Manson!
B00004YRQA|5.0|I think this card is awesome! It has plenty of storage and is super fast!...If you are gentle with the card when u put it in the console and dont just jam it in it wont break. And the cards are super fast the reason that they seem slow is the game itself. I would highly reccomend buying the card. The only thing that could make it better is if you could save ps1 games on there or after you save a game on the card you shouldnt need the game anymore and just play it off the card. But i guess thats illegal.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is one of those rare books that absolutely everyone should read; I reccommend it unceasingly to anyone and everyone. Though it is long, it is very readable, and you'll probably go through it quickly because it's so entertaining. Aside from its sheer fun and humor however, is the true message behind the book. It is often cited as being one of the great ant-war novels - and, indeed, it is just about flawless in this respect - but it goes much deeper than that. Catch-22 is really a book about paradoxes, and the sheer (necessary) insanity of modern life. The title itself is now a common - and oft-heard - refrain in the English language, and many might be unaware of its original source. The dictionary defines &quot;Catch-22&quot; as &quot;a problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule&quot; - and that is exactly what the novel presents: situations showing the sheer necessary insanity of modern life. (War is one such - perhaps the most obvious - instance, but there are many others. This book offers satire on other subjects as well - i.e., federal aid for farmers.) And could life as we know it exist without this inherent madness? The question might be a lot more difficult to answer than you think. The premise of this book can also be summed up in a phrase from another great author, Fyodor Dostoevsky, &quot;If everything on earth were rational, nothing would happen.&quot; That is what the book tries to say. It is not merely a simple anti-war book, despite what some shallow-headed readers and reviewers might say. I suggest that you read the book with an open mind: it's well worth it. The book is quite hilarous as well - the satire being very sharp-toothed. The book does not have a plot - indeed, it does not even attempt to tell a story, at least not in the usual sense. (Nearly) every chapter is named for a character in the book, and that chapter gradually portrays some of that particular character's crazy antics. Little bits of plot are glimpsed here and there, and then revealed gradually. The book is very non-linear and quite scattershot. It's similar to the way Kurt Vonnegut writes. I reccommend that everyone read this book. Quite aside from its near universal praise and the fact that an everyday word has sprung from it, it was in the Top 10 (#6, I believe) on New Modern Library's Top 100 Books of the 20th century. Put it on your reading list.

Adam starts off very naive and gets taken advantage of by Cathy; and not until later does he finally become more aware and sees what Cathy really is. A theme in this novel is the need to be loved. Charles and Caleb, both feel that thier father's do not love them and this creates an extreme jealousy of Adam and Aron respectively.
B00003CXI1|5.0|As one of millions of adult Harry Potter Fans, I was a little skeptical of how well the movie would follow the book. I was glad that it was pretty true to it. <br />We watched it all weekend long with both of my kids (ages 6 years and 3 years). Both boys enjoyed it and didn't get scared.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I love this movie,i only hope they schedule it for a sooner dvd release!This is a movie that has evrything!A great plot,funny, entertaining, and even a mean villian!Its a whole lot better then SHREK which was not good at all!It was certainly a huge success!<BR>   Story<BR>     It starts off as the rivals Sulley and Randall compete in their daily scaring routines to get childrens scream,which support the monster city.Now sulley as the top scarer wins by about 900 points or something and gets Randall mad only to come out to no good and then the trouble starts!When Sulley finds a little girl in the monster world he goes crazy being taught that humans are toxic!When he shows her to his best friend Mike in a resturant,she gets loose and everyone goes on a chase to find the monsters who have the child!While Mike and Sulley try and return her to her home bonds grow between them and betrayals start when the boss of Monsters inc. and Randall find out that Mike and Sulley have the child!
B000060P79|5.0|every song is a classic, but i must make special mention of Perfect. the lyrics are superb, makes you cry actually.<br />my alien has a different rhythm and beat, very creative. and of course, who could forget the irresistible first single, i'm just a kid.
B00005YW4H|3.0|No, it's not jazz, per se, but I think Norah Jones is no to something.  I got the disk at a local ... store for [price], and figure it's worth at least that much.  I think Jones has effectively crossed genres, mixing jazz and folk/alt-country, and the band sounds good.  <br />The biggest problem here is the original material.  Most of it was written by a couple of her band members, who need to take some creative writing courses--their lyrics are really weak.  She would have done better to go with more covers.<br />If you want some truly excellent jazz/americana fusion, try Cassandra Wilson.  Her new album, Belly of the Sun, has some real gems on it.  I also love her album New Mood Daughter.
B00005LC3Y|5.0|I have read a lot of people's reviews of this film and they talk about the director being a sham and the acting phony and so on.<BR>But I will say as a vet, that every step of this movie is real. It is so real that it is hard for me to watch. It is how life in combat is. It takes place in Vietnam but could as well be any other conflict at any other time. Watching those men die by the sniper near the end almost cracked me because that is how it is. As far as I see it, this film was made for people that don't go to combat because the film makers what those people to see the confusion, love, hate, and down right wonderment that vets face everyday of their life. This movie is real. \\"The Deer Hunter\\" and stuff like that is not.
B00005QDW1|1.0|....it's more like floundering.<br />I've been a fan of No Doubt since their 1995 release &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; which was PHENOMONAL. Return of Saturn (2000) was a mediocre disc, and so I eagerly awaited their next release.<br />When I first heard the song &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, I was thinking &quot;This is a hit- the cd must be awesome. They're experimenting with a new style; this is cool&quot;. Little did I know that 'experimenting with a new style (styleS is more like it)' meant totally abandoning their ska roots which hooked so many of their fans in the first place. <br />There are a few tracks which are good- Hey Baby, and the predictable current single Hella Good- which totally preaches of this band's need to please. They used to be an original, inventive, and upcoming band. Now that they've hit the big time, they've decided that original is not always good.<br />So, No Doubt, if you ever read any of these reviews, please take a hint.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This review is a bit late considering Ive owned the CD for over a year now. Despite that however, it is still one of the few cd's Ive kept in constant rotation in my car.  <br />India Arie has been compared to all the other female &quot;neo-soul artists&quot;-Erica, Jill, ect., but I think she's got a style all her own that gives me hope that one day soon well get back to real music instead of the booboo R&amp;B that's out today. The fact that she failed to pick up a single Grammy goes to show that true talent is often overlooked while mediocre arists get all the fame(prime example--Alicia Keys).<br />If you have yet to pick up the album, do yourself and your ears a favor and pick it up!
B00003CXI0|5.0|It's one thing to say that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone didn't align directly with the book.. However, for a movie with a target audience of children it's not possible to incorporate every single part of the original storyline unless you wanted a 5 hour epic.  Credit must go both to JK Rowling and Chris Columbus for this project which capitivated almost all sectors of it's audience.  <br />The performance of Tom Felden as Draco Malfoy seems to have gone largely un-noticed...  I believe that he equals if not out-doing Daniel Radcliffe.  Also, the all-British casting of the show worked to great effect as it kept a sense of continuity in the  accents and subtle nuances of the character.  <br />This movie is amazing.. sure! buy it for your children (but get a second copy for yourself while you're at it) You'll be swept away by the amazing characterisations, the music, the cinematography and the pure magic which goes to make up &quot;Harry's Wonderful World&quot;
B00003CXI1|2.0|I have not read the books so I am rating this as a new viewer.<br />This movie started out great and had a touch of class few movies have anymore.  It was catchy and entertaining.  However, it takes a twist into a D&D segment and totally throws you for a loop.  I lost interest as my kids who were dying to see it.  The ending was really weak, as well.  We all know that Harry is the hero, but come on!  They could've done something a bit better than that TOTALLY EXPECTED end sequence when the different houses were being awarded for their points. YAWN. <BR>All I suggest is you rent it before you buy it... I'm glad I did!
B00005V9QJ|2.0|This is an unfortunate attempt to stage the beautiful studio recordings of Sade and her collaborators on a &quot;live&quot; stage. Never a strong live singer and a rather shy performer, there is no reason for anybody to go to a live concert or buy this album, as most of the tracks are perfect copies of the studio originals (incl. soundeffects) and add nothing new. This does not mean that this is not beautiful music, on the contrary, but just not suitable for a live concert.
B0000640SA|2.0|The only reason this movie keeps you guessing is through the use of deceptive editing. Had the director used a straight-forward timeline, the \\"mystery\\" would be immediately evident.. I personally don't like contrived confusion.  If the screenplay isn't clever enough to engage the movie-goer then throw in a few \\"cuts,\\" jump the time-line around, and \\"voila\\" instant confusion.  Much the same effect as Quentin Tarantino uses. When the movie ended, I felt cheated because the mystery is so profoundly mudane.  Give me Hitchcock any day.
B00005JG6R|5.0|Akira is an awsome anime movie. It has awsome graphincs &amp; animations. WHen my friend first told me about it, I wanted to see it really bad. I finally got to see it, &amp; I loved it! I went out &amp; bought the movie. Since then, it's been my absolute fave movie, &amp; that was like back in March. They did good work on the characters, too. Each one has his/her own unique personality, which is a good thing in anime movies. Akira IS a masterpiece.
0792844882|4.0|I finally rented it after hearing all the negative [stuff] about it.  Just goes to show you need to see a movie and judge it for YOURSELF!  I enjoyed it beyond any expectations.  I have now purchased it for my DVD collection.  Elizabeth Berkley is hot (except her rear view wasn't all that great...) but Gina... YUMMY.  The very ending was a bit easy, but comical.  I loved the movie.
B000060P79|5.0|This CD is the coolest CD and I made sure all my friends bought it.  The guys from Simple Plan are so cool and their songs are so incredible because any teenager can relate to the songs and realize that other people are going through it too.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem really surprised me with this record. I expected the same I recieved on \\"Slim Shady LP\\" and \\"Marshall Mather's LP\\". I was partially looking forward to have some explicit, humourous tracks to listen through a couple times, but was shocked with what I recieved. First off, I noted it was less explicit then his last CDs and more...well, smart. The tracks are much more well down, and more thought out. The lyrics are clever and intellegent, and for the most part don't rely on ... tricks and shock value. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. Each song is atleast pretty good on this CD, and it is EASILY better than all his other CDs.Heres my lowdown of the tracks.<BR>------------------------<BR>-1. Curtains Up (skit)- 0/5 - Its an intro...what can I say, I'm not a fan of intros and skits.<BR>-2. White America- 5/5 - This is the track the convinced me I was in head for an amazing album. The beat, the lyrics and the over all composure of this track is beautiful. <BR>-3. Business- 4/5 - After the first song, this song is a great way to lighten you up. Its less serious, and more fun (I love the Andre and Rapboy bit...) However, the repeated \\"Marshall!\\" got to me after awhile.<BR>-4. Cleaning Out My Closet- 5/5 - Another track on this CD is absolutely love. I can listen to this track forever. The only weak point I find on this track is the first verse starts off pretty monotone and boring. However, it picks up into a serious and well scripted telling of his life.<BR>-5. Square Dance- 5/5 - And another comedic track to break from the serious. This track has an awesome beat, and I love the lyrics. The chorus is awesome too, and sounds really neat. <BR>-6. The Kiss (skit)- 3/5- 3/5 is an EXTREMELY high mark for a skit to recieve with me. However, this skit has a great mood set with the dramatic music in the background. It is also the most serious, and most meaningful skit I have ever listened to.<BR>-7. Soldier- 4/5- Soldier is an okay song, with a good beat and fairly goodlyrics, but it falls short compared to the other stuff. <BR>-8. Say Goodbye Hollywood- 5/5- Another one of my favourite songs on this CD. The chorus, the lyrics, the story. Its like a perfect display of events explaining his life and position...brings a tear to your eye.<BR>-9. Drips - 4/5- Drips has one of my favourite choruses on the CD, and the message is good...I think. It has a good beat as well, and gives you a good taste of whats gonna come from Obie. <BR>-10. Without Me- 3/5- Without Me is probably one of my least favourite songs on the CD...although I still enjoy it. It is a good party song, but Is the new \\"Real Slim Shady\\" (thats to say its good...until you hear it too many times)<BR>-11. Paul Rosenberg- 1/5- Another boring skit...<BR>-12. Sing For The Moment- 4/5- I like this song...especially the melodic chorus. Its a good song, and shows his artistic growth.<BR>-13. Superman- 6/5- I LOVE this songs chorus. The chorus of this song is amazing, and the verses don't fall short either. This is my favourite track on the CD, easily.<BR>-14. Hailie's Song- 3/5- EMINEM's attempt at singing isn't the greatest, but I actually like this song. Especially the fact he acknowledges he can't sing, and only is singing for his girl. <BR>-15. Steve Berman- 2/5- Another Skit...It got such a \\"high\\" mark because I like Steve.<BR>-16. When the Music Stops- 4/5- -This song gives some of the variety that makes this CD so great. I like some of D12s stuff (Especially stuff like \\"I'll Sh*t On You\\"<BR>-17. Say What You Say- 4/5- Yet another good track..but you probably saw that coming. He teams up with mentor Dr. Dre for this track, and this track helps remind us how em got big in the first place.<BR>-18. 'Till I Collapse- 4/5- Another song I really like, although just for the chorus more than anything else. Nate Dogg was very well picked for the part of this song's chorus.<BR>-19. My Dad's Gone Crazy- 5/5- I love this song. The lyrics are a little iffy, but thats because the songis about him...well... going crazy. Hailie is perfect in this song too, making it an awesome chorus. The only thing I really don't like in this song is Hailie's creepy laugh at the end...<BR>-20. Curtains Close- 3/5- What can I say...Its a skit yes, but there is singing making fun of the worst song on this CD...
0465068359|1.0|Iris Chang states that the objective of this book is to refute the recent claims by Japanese reactionaries that the the Rape of Nanking either did not happen or was something of a much smaller scale. By presenting legitimate information side by side with stories and photographs long ago proved to be false, she failed dismally in this objective and ended up giving more ammunition to the rightists than before. It is the brutal rule in the world of history that if you include one very sloppily researched piece of data in your work, your detractors will say that the rest of your book must be just as sloppy. Chang invites such criticism by including dozens. This has had no noticeable effect on the American audience, but has given great deal of material to Japanese reactionaries, the very people Chang set out to discredit. <BR>Yoshinori Kobayashi, a best selling writer and conservative revisionist in Japan, has sited Chang seven times in his work, as if to say \\"Chang is a phony, therefore her subject matter must be equally fake\\".<BR>A the closing of the Second World War there were plenty of sceptics and doubters about the Nazi Holocaust. There are few such sceptics today because a lot of historians put in an enormous amount of shoe leather work. The Rape of Nanking has recieved considerablly less serious investigative attention and the addition of an amature like Iris Chang does not help the victims of the massacre or the truth that needs to be told.<BR>This book is just a quick and dirty shot at the fifteen minutes of fame. Serious students are advised to avoid it.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|I thought it was the biggest wasted of time.  If I could sue for my time back, I would.
B000002KAT|5.0|Astral Weeks is to Van Morrison, as What's Going On is to Marvin Gaye, as Sgt. Pepper is to The Beatles, as Automatic For the People is to REM, as A Love Supreme is to John Coltrane, etc.<br />In other words, this is a Masterwork by a legendary performer that is unlike anything else he has ever done and ever will do.  <br />It is an album of rare beauty, balance and coherence.  Astral Weeks is not for everyone, but if you are patient, you will be rewarded.

However, if you're one of those immature people that only listen for the making fun of people and homosexual disses...look somewhere else.

B00000DGSN|5.0|Ritchie Blackmore's sheer speed, technical ability, tasteful playing, background in classical music and live stage presence and flash make him by far, the best rock guitar player, ever.<BR>Ian Paice's chops and speed are still standards by which modern drummers aspire to.<BR>I have both the original Made In Japan CD and this re-release and the audio clarity, detail and dynamics are amazing.
0671781383|5.0|Man's Search for Meaning is an interesting and inspirational book that asks the question, what motivates the human race to survive?  After surviving the hardships faced during his 3 years in four different concentration camps, Viktor Frankl created a theory known as Logotherapy.  From \\"Logos\\" the Greek word for Meaning.  During his time in the camps Frankl attempted to rewrite his life's achievement his manuscript.  It was taken from him when he first arrived in Auschwitz.  Whenever he found a small scrap piece of paper he would write down what he could.  Frankl believes that the rewriting of his manusript is what allowed him to survive.  In the second section of the book entitled \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\", Frankl describes his theory of man's primary motivation being his meaning of life.  Throught this section of the book he describes where you may find this meaning and how to go about searching for it.  I personally have always shown a deep interest in concentration camps and the Holocaust.  Therefore it was very easy for me to deeply enjoy this book.  I found it interesting and unique that he wrote this book not about the tragic events of WWII but his personal experience.  This book inspired me to search for the meaning of my own life and look more deeply into the strength and power of the human mind.  In my favorite quote from the book, Frankl describes how not only is he a professor of two sciences, but also is a survivor of four concentration camps who has seen the bravery and strength of the human mind and body.
0743216458|5.0|Having watched the HBO series when it first aired, I wanted to pick up the book to read coincident with the replay of the series on HBO.  I'm glad that I did.  I felt the series was excellent--truly visually compelling.  As most books do, however, the additional essence of what the men of Easy Company experienced from the first day of training to the end of the war in Europe could only be provided by the written word.  The additional depth and breadth of coverage in the book provided insights not available by simply watching the series.  Although not necessarily flowing smoothly like fiction normally does, Band Of Brothers was an easy, compelling read.  Whatever choppiness might exist can be forgiven as the reader gets more and more insight into the tenaciousness, courage, perseverance, valor and honor of the men of Easy Company.  This is truly a worthwhile read, regardless of whether or not the reader has seen the HBO series.
B000005HN6|5.0|Virtuous use of acoustic and electric guitar melodies, power chords, death vocals, and so many other things I haven't yet come close to understanding. The changes in tempo are effortless throughout, which makes for great music. Quickly becoming one of my favorite albums. OPETH is a force with whom to be wreckoned.
B00006690F|5.0|I listen to many different types of music. Eminem's style of music is one of my personal favorites~ I don't consider him a \\"white rapper.\\" I consider him Eminem.. and he has a music style all his own!I loved his first two CDs and this one lives up to the expectations of the others! His voice is different in some of the songs.. Almost a little of a new side of Eminem maybe?<br />Without Me is one of the best songs on the album. It's no wonder it's the first single off this new album. Some of my other favorites are Superman, Sing For the Moment, Clean out my Closet, and Till I Collapse.<br />This CD is a definite 5 stars. I was disapointed though. The whole CD I kept waiting on Ken Kaniff. I think that makes an Eminem cd complete... well I was in for a surprise on track # 20 (Curtains Close). :-)<br />Eminem fans- you won't be disapointed! Eminem has done it again!
B000065U1N|4.0|Instead of the typical gung-ho, high-fiving, politically correct, technically innacurate rubbish that comes with most Hollywood war movies, this movie was a breath of fresh air.<br />Finally, somebody has created a film that captures the horror, chaos, confusion, comradeship, and individual bravery of soldiers caught up in a war zone. Moreover, the film is technically accurate. (A colleague of mine is a ex-Ranger company commander. He said it was so true to life, right down to the operating procedures and tactics.)<br />I would also recommend reading the book by Mark Bowden. Like the movie, this will also keep you on the edge of your seat.
B000063JDE|4.0|I was as excited about this SE release as anyone.  The extra I was most looking forward to (like anyone else) were the \\"deleted scenes\\".  I got the disc early and that's the first place I went.  When you select this feature you get some diatribe about how two hours of footage was lost.  You then get a montage of studio stills set to creepy music.  No dialogue, no explanation, no commentary, nothing.  It's nice for novelty sake, but I think it's misleading to call them \\"scenes\\" which were deleted.  It should have been called \\"stills from scenes which were deleted\\".  The documentary is GREAT which features new interviews with the stars spliced with old interviews with Lynch. The transfer is beautiful and the sound (5.1) is a definite improvement over the previous release.  At the end of the day, the transfer, sound, and documentary is Heineken.  The deleted scenes are Pabst Blue Ribbon.
1567184855|5.0|I am an Ordained Minister in the Spiritualist religion.  I have studied and read most of all the past great books on \\"Spirits\\".  I rate this book a 10 star book. Belief is not an option.  Knowing that this author's process took many years with detailed analysis, over writes all other so called \\"Channeled\\" or \\"Spirit Inspired\\" books. Read it, you will NOT be disappointed.  All other books will then be measured by this one.  Afterwards, read also his first book on this subject \\"Journal of Souls\\".  It to is rated very high on my MUST read SHORT list of 5 books.
B00006690F|3.0|I was really dissapointed in this album... Virtually every song on the album EM is yelling into the  mic.  Dude is a millionare and I dont feel him any longer, Why is he yelling??  Cause his mom has issues??? Come on now!!!  Three songs on the album pass due to good production...
0140186395|5.0|As the title implies, East of Eden by John Steinbeck contains a plethora of biblical allusions. These allusions primarily stem from the first book of the bible Genesis as references range from Adam and Eve to Cain and Abel, even sometimes quoting the passages directly. The many parallels add interest to the novel as the reader is able to see the interesting interpretations presented by Steinbeck.<br />While this book does maintain a great tie to the Bible, knowledge of the Bible is not required for one to enjoy this novel. Steinbeck's masterful intertwining plots along with his thought provoking style are engaging, creating a desire to continue reading. His writing is not immensely difficult to read, yet was dense in incite. East of Eden causes one to question aspects of one's own character, leaving an everlasting impression on one's way of life. East of Eden was truly a pleasure to read. ...

B00004R99L|3.0|My favorite Disney movie of all time is Alice in Wonderland. When I realized that it was out on DVD and I hadn't bought it, I looked for it everywhere and couldn't find it, until I bought it here at Amazon. I was curious about the extra footage on the disc, considering that the film was over 55 years old, I didn't expect there to be too much.<br />What I found was a rerelease trailer (note: not the original theatrical trailer!) and an amusing and informative documentary called \\"Operation: Wonderland\\" from the 1950s featuring Walt Disney himself. I was satisfied with the disc, that is, until I did some researching.<br />Apparently the Laserdisc version of Alice has many more extras on it. Why Disney opted to not put them on the DVD is beyond me, but I think it really hurt the disc. Not to mention, the picture quality isn't that fantastic. I would have loved to give Alice something higher, but I have to be fair and give it three stars.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plans cd &quot;No Pads, No Helmets....Just Balls&quot; is really awesome. There are no bad songs on this cd. They are upbeat and energetic. I would really recommend this cd to anyone who's thinking about buying it.
0783225849|4.0|The picture and sound quality of Psycho on DVD are great. Bernard Herrmann's score is especially chilling. The strings all are sharp enough to send shivers racing down your spine toward the Bates Motel. The 90-minute documentary on the DVD is great, as are the other extras (which include the 6 minute trailer, promotional footage, production stills, and other things of the like). <br />Unfortunately, the extra footage gets very redundant very quickly, with the promotional (and mislabeled &quot;newsreel&quot;) footage basically restating what was said in the documentary. Not to mention, the promotional footage is redundant enough of itself. The static menus are a bit dissapointing also, but besides, Psycho is a great buy! One of my favorite DVDs.
B00003CXI0|5.0|This movie is by far the best movie ever! I absolutely love it! Since I bought it I've already watched it six times! It might seem crazy but the movie is everything I expected it to be. It's pretty true to the book as well. I can't wait till &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.&quot; The whole cast was great too. Daniel Radcliffe made an amazing Harry Potter and Emma Watson was great as Hermione Granger. But I think that Rupert Grint gave the best performance. For being a newcomer he was great! I think everyone was great though. I would love to know how they made Robbie Coltrane look so big but I guess that is part of the magic behind the movie. I highly recommend buying this movie. Their are only two deleted scenes on the VHS but they are cool.
B000063WDH|5.0|\\"Makes them White Stripes sound like Herman's Hermits,\\" my pal Lennie said the other day as we spun the Big Come Up for the fifth time in a row.<BR> Dan Auerback (guitars + howlin') sounds like a toothless old Mississippi codger, moanin' like he does. And his guitar rings truer than just about anything else you're likely to hear this side o' Judgment Day. Patrick Carney makes a lotta noise and it all sounds real good too.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I wrote a review of KID A and then I started seeing the same sort of storyline in Amnesiac.  I think it's another album about the Son of Kid A.  Onward.<br />the opening moment of this album-the child of Kid A is recovering from amnesia.  the album is the story of HIS life.<br />packt like sardines in a crushd tin box--<BR>daddy's in the ground.  it's a response to his father (who was Kid A)'s funeral.  he is saying to his father, as well as the reporters who are asking him stupid questions at the funeral, that he's reasonable--just to leave him alone right now.<BR>this song also foreshadows what will happen to the boy later on.<br />pyramid song--<BR>the fact that he is alone again in the world, no cloned daddy or human mommy, depresses him, and he jumps in the river and finds a new meaning, as he almost DIES, he realizes he is a moron and that he should quit fearing his life and doubting himself.<BR>HOWEVER, this song is also about Kid A in heaven and how he goes there.  Perhaps the entire Amnesiac album is a duality from Father and (hmm, why not?) Son.<br />pulk/pull revolving doors--<BR>almost like a near-death experience in the river.  he knows that he should, um, quit drowning and get out of the water, but, um, he can't...and has a near-death experience with his dad, and sees the doors...all the doors of heaven and hell.<BR>this also applies to his father, doing the same thing, before Kid A says \\"what are you doing here, go home!\\"<br />you and whose army--<BR>he's back out, settling in to his life in the world.  he's leading some sort of separatist movement, or he is rejecting his lover.<br />i might be wrong--<BR>well, I might be wrong about all of this... :)<BR>but hey.<BR>he is out living his life, taking risks, he seems to have a love for the water (since it connected him to his Dad), and he might be a nature guide, \\"let's go down the waterfall\\", and \\"think about the good times.\\"  living easy in the wild, he leads people thru the forests and the rivers.<br/>knives out--<BR>he encounters his love that he dumped in \\"you and whose army\\".  she is with her boyfriend/husband on a nature trip, when out of his innate jealousy and hate, he KILLS him, and since they also seem to be lost in the wild, suggest we eat his body to stay alive.  in the end, his plan works out perfectly, as he gets the girl, but not before...<br />morning bell/amnesiac--<BR>again.  but it's more human this time, and different.  the son of Kid A divorces his love on the same grounds that separated his parents.  <br />dollars and cents--<BR>now that he's free of the witch SHE turned out to be, he can move on, now in his fifties and rooted in the real world of money-changing, even in the temples.<br />hunting bears--<BR>on vacation, he has to relive the experiences he had in the song \\"knives out\\", and his ex-wife, not so stupid after all, comes along and says \\"hey, why couldn't we have just hunted the bears in the woods?\\"  that night, on the news, \\"the son of Kid A has been arrested and charged with murder...\\"<br />like spinning plates--<BR>oh no, he thinks. I was doing so well, before it all started coming down around me.  what is this nonsense?  the plates are going to fall, i'll get 35 to life.  oh no!<br />life in a glass house--<BR>the title.  he's still under the media's eye, he's the only child of a human clone, after all.  all he does is watched, and then in the end, he is in trouble with the same government who created his father, his only friend, the reason for his being in the first place.  this is when he finds US, the listeners, the millions captivated by his and his father's lives, and he'd love to talk to all of us, but how can he? the government is listening in.  also, of course, he's denying he killed the man, with the ironic line \\"i'd love to stay and chew the fat\\".  he's being sort of, er, flippant, so that we won't suspect him, and it remains to be seen if we do or not, since the song stops without a resolution.
B00005RFAI|4.0|This album is so brilliant, I got the first album and ever since then I've been waiting for another one and this doesn't disappoint. My favourite song personally has to be the soulful 'Eventually'. It makes full use of Pink's fantastically deep and soulful voice and combines it with powerful lyrics. A close second is 'Numb'. The raw emotion is chilling and makes the perfect song for taking out any anxiety! The only disappointment on this album is the bonus track. The track 'Respect' seemed at first like another disappointment, but it soon grows on you. 'Misery' with Steven Tyler is another thrilling track which shows off the incredible range of Pink's vocal abilities. This album is definitely worth the money, you want to listen to anything else after hearing it.
0380789035|5.0|The Gods Must Be Crazy....<br />When I picked this up, I vaguely thought it was some kind of murder mystery -- I read the back, which said something about man just released from prison finding out his wife has been murdered.<br />That's only the beginning of a long and delicious story told by a master storyteller.  A mixture of a hip road trip across America, along with magical rides with mystical creatures, the eternal external and internal battle 'twixt good and evil, Christlike sacrifice and suffering, human and godly greed, wit, trickery, violence, poetry and much more.<br />Set in the US in our time, the main character, Shadow, looks forward to reuniting with his wife Laura after serving 3 years in prison. Instead, he  finds out she's been killed in an accident.  He's released early and flies home next to a man named Wednesday, who knows everything about Shadow and shows up in the most unexpected places until Shadow agrees to be sort of a bodyguard to Wednesday.  He has dark and mystical dreams; the lovely, but slowly decaying Laura, pays him wistful visits.<br />He meets some ancient foreigners as well as some younger and more stylish folks on separate sides of an escalating disagreement.  This is the classic story with a contemporary twist. The old Gods men used to worship and sacrifice for (virgins and the innocent) are battling the new gods humans worship and sacrifice for (time, original thinking and more) -- TV, consumerism and technology.  Gaiman's satire runs deep.  How about a modern goddess named Media -- 'isn't she the one who killed her children?' one god asks.  Another answers &quot;Different woman.  Same story.&quot;)<br />Though it doesn't always help to compare one writer's style with another, there are shades of Stephen King's The Stand with a touch of Bukowski and Kerouac.  Since reading this book, I've read two more of his and am searching for more. All were excellent,  managing to be similar, but very different.<br />Gaiman is clearly a gifted storyteller -- whatever I read by him leaves me wanting to read more.  Thought provoking, riveting, humorous,  wonderfully written.a gifted storyteller -- whatever I read by him leaves me wanting to read more.

B00003CXI1|4.0|This movie is just fantastic. Very true to the book, unlike most films. This is a definite plus.<br />With the good come the bad. The deleted scenes are a pain to find. I originally thought I'd been had and it was false advertising. However, once I discovered it was at the end of the game, I felt better.<br />The picture quality is okay but I've seen better. There are moire patterns with the passing Hedwig on the menus and the visual effects are not blended very well. Even my kid said, \\"now that looks fake\\". Blanching I said, \\"yes it does\\".<br />As far as the movie goes, the acting was very good. Emma Watson was a little too over-dramatic for my taste but she's the only one. The casting was superb. The set was 'just as I imagined'. Perhaps even better. I liked the dark look about it.<br />I take away a star for the visual effects problem and the Hedwig/Menu/Moire pattern problem. I don't take away more stars for the visual effects because I think it's the setting that caused the problem. Can't describe it, you'd just have to see what I mean instead.
B000056QE5|5.0|All the songs on this album are splendid and worth singing over and over again. It's great for both children and adults. Plus it really impresses people that I can sing the WHOLE &quot;Spoonful of Sugar&quot; song and that I know all the words.

This music PERFECTLY hits the moods of the movie.. Both happy times and sad times..<br />The 3 best songs are:<BR>\\"You Can't Take Me!!!\\"<br />\\"Get Off of my Back!!!\\"<br />\\"Sound the Bugle\\"<br />Buy this album..!!<br />It is a classic...!!!

B00005QG9J|1.0|Its pretty obvious that this CD has taken a split. Almost all the hardcore old fan base(you know, Fungus Amongus and S.C.I.E.N.C.E fans) hate this CD and most of the newer fans like it. That is not to say all older fans hate this CD, but the vast majority of the older fans don't paticularly like Incubus's new direction. I'm one to lean toward the opinion of the older fans, but not just as an alienated fan, but a music fan as well.<br />The sad reality is this music is flacid, weak, and unispired. All the elements that made Incubus, well Incubus have been striped away for sub-standard alt. rock. Everything on here is nothing special, even with some \\"experimental\\" sounds on here. The guitar work is the worse yet for this band. Boyd's lyrics' are unpoetic stuffed with some really bad similies. The drummer relies to heavily on cymbals and can't really keep time, AT ALL! Finally Kilmore, once a very inventive DJ(check out some of his scratch work on Make Yourself and compare), now can't seem to mesh with his music he's working with and plays some pretty boring samples. Overall, this feels like a rushed, capitalize on the popularity of a song style record that we're all too familiar with these days. The only positive thing I have to say about this record is that Boyd's singing is even better, showing off an impressive display of pipes(too bad his lyrics [aren't very good]). Between this and Oysterhead, \\"Mourning\\" View is one of the most disapointing releases of 2001.
B00005RIKD|3.0|This album is &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;different&quot; and contains a lot of gospel music. It's great from the cerebral, Sting-is-a-genius point of view, but for regular listening I prefer the albums.
0151003084|5.0|I discovered the twisted genius of Edward Gorey as a lad in rural Oregon. Some subversive, or uninformed, librarian in our small town had stocked the cartoon book section of the library with several Gorey books and I devoured each with fiendish glee!<BR>Thus began my slow decent into the murky world of cynical humor. What a delicious trip it has been.<BR>Mr Gorey also produced the opening credits for PBS' Mystery! series in the 1980's to my utter delight. I would often watch the credits only and skip the predictable british fare that followed.<BR>The character referred to in my title is my favorite Gorey drawing. It shows our poor mr. Titus, a rather dull looking lad, holding a package that will, no doubt, bring about his rude demise. That is the genius of Gorey's works, so much is left to the imagination that it's like running a mental marathon! So few works of modern writing encourage your brain to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot;. This is the stuff that will leave you begging for more.

B00005JKCF|2.0|I watched the Spiderman cartoon as a kid and I don't remember the love story behind it all being rammed down my throat the way it was in this movie. Granted I didn't read the comic book, so perhaps it was more of a theme there. I thought they went way too overboard with the love story in this movie. I don't have a problem with love stories, but I didn't go to watch Spiderman for the romance. For the amount of action that did happen in the movie, it was great. Willem Dafoe is awesome. No doubt about that. I recommend people see him in the movie Shadow of the Vampire if they liked him in Spiderman. Toby McGuire did a good job too, even though the guy had to spit out the most nauseating romantic lines I've heard in quite a while. But Kirsten Dunst, talented actress that she is, just didn't seem the best suited to the role that she played. I think the movie could have been a lot better if they had chopped out 50% of the romance and substituted it with more action.
B000059XY5|4.0|Batman Returns is very odd.  Having introduced the most of the main characters and gadgets in the previous film number two had to work harder to be surprising.  Returns is lighter in tone than the first Batman film but never descends to embarrassing camp of the later films.  Here Batman fights against the power hungry Penguin and the vengeful Cabwoman.<br />Returns is arguably the best film of the four.  It is certain the most well written.  It also contains the best performance as Batman.  Keaton was never an obvious choice for the role but gives possible the definite performance as Batman.  Keaton makes a great Batman and is given a lot to do both as Bruce Wayne and his cowled alter ego.  Whether he's respondsing to Penguin's threats or showing his distain for Max Shreck Keaton is great.  And of course, the sets are great.<br />It's far from perfect.  Some of the lines stink and some parts could be better.  Never does it rise to the standard of the animated series and the soundtack has gone slightly down hill.<br />When Batman Returns is good, it is really good.  The confrontations between Devito and Keaton have a certain magic.  Devito's scene in the graveyard is also well done.    However, I think that the Masquerade ball is the best part of, not just the film but the entire series.  Bruce Wayne is falling for Selina Kyle who he realises is actually Catwoman.  It is a wonderful, touching, off beat scene which goes a lot of places.  It is just annoying that none of the following two films have asended to this level of quality.<br />If you're a Batman fan you could do a lot worse than Batman Returns.
B00005OAIE|4.0|So I don't fit the marketing matrix of MTV-2, but there I'am and all of a sudden I see/listen to the John Mayer song &quot;No Such Thing&quot; and I'm taken back to the early 1970s and the acoustic rock of America and Batdorf and Rodney.  The prominence of the acoustic guitars with subtle electric backing and harmony vocals reminds me of the day when &quot;Tin Man&quot; and &quot;Ventura Highway&quot; ruled the airwaves. I've now listend to the entire album and it's a winner in every way.  This middle agester has found a place for this artist in a huge and varied collection. A little Motorhead, followed by some Moody Blues, backed with some Zep, soothed out with Mr. Mayer, and then on to Tal Farlow, Air Sculpture, and finally some Eloy, America, and Venom. Buy this guy's stuff!
0761536434|5.0|This is the kind of book that I have been waiting for.  After reading Kent's last book \\"FIRST QUARTER\\" I felt that everything had been covered in the annals of video games...I was wrong.<br /><br />Starting at the birth of the pinball games and the people who bred life into them Kent takes us on a wild ride through memory lane that I did not want to end.<br /><br />I felt myself glued to this book pages after I wanted to put it down and anyone who thought that they knew everything about everything about video games will find themselves scratching their head learning something new [There is no knowledge that is not power] and insightful about the genre.<br /><br />Finally, I take my hat off to Mr. Steve Kent for giving me a look back to the days when video games were king and quarters were the gateway to another world.

B000062TU1|5.0|I have not read any of the books and had no interest in the film when it came out because I didn't understand what all the hype was about. Now I do. I absolutely loved this movie. Wonderful special effects, brilliant costumes, and a very charming and likeable cast make this one of the best films of the year. Its magical,clever,engaging,funny, and exciting. Theres not a dull moment in this film and I can't wait for the second installment.
B000002H97|4.0|Well there are mixed reviews. this album is good. is is well played and the production is great the cover and the marketing and commercial status around it was also good. But the material itself on the LP well the songs are good and the musicianship is great but the songs lack of speed and lack of that hard rock garage heat that could be heard on their previous LPs. The songs are shorter and many of them sound to alike. The album containes a bit originality and is certainly not their best. But this album is okay and good and is worth to buy. But if you expect a really fast hard metal this will be a disapointment.
0393317552|5.0|Ever wonder why Europeans conquered the New World?  Sure the easy explanation is that the Europeans had better technology and organization that the Native Americans could not overcome.  But, ever wonder why it wasn't the Inca who sailed over the Atlantic and conquered Europe?  Or why Africa was colonized by Europe, even though Africa is the birthplace of Homo sapiens?  Guns, Germs and Steel tries to answer this question.  <br />Diamond has written a facinating book trying to answer that question.  He argues that the early domestication of plants and large mammals (cows, horses, etc.) allowed civilizations in Europe and Asia to develop much faster than civilizations in the Americas, Africa or Austrailia.  Contributing to this (relatively) quick development is the fact that Eurasia's main axis is east-west, which allowed an easier spread of basic food production package from the Fertile Crescent to Europe, as well as the Chinese food production to spread throughout Asia as the local hunter-gatherer communities had to either adapt the sedentary way of life or get overrun by the more populous farming societies.  <br />I don't want to give much more away, since the author really explains the points of his thesis quite well.  Some reviews have criticized him as too repetitive.  I found it quite easy to follow his arguement since I didn't have to waste time trying to find the specific page from 10 chapters previous to refresh my memory.  <br />Also, as I read some of the previous reviews, I found that many of the negative reviews were based on two objections.  One deals with a sentence at the beginning of the book where he states that an average New Guinean is smarter than an average westerner because of our sedentary lifestyle vs. their hunter-gatherer lifestyle.  Personally, I don't think there is a way to create a test which would prove or disprove that statement.  <br />Others have claimed that the author is too PC, and has made some Marxist statements.  I was going totry to refute those arguements, but instead I implore anyone reading this review to get the book and judge for yourself.  Is it perfect? No.  Are his theories air-tight?  No.  He admits this himself.  I encourage everyone to read this with an open mind.  You might be suprised.

0142000655|4.0|John Steinbeck's East of Eden is a complex work of art.  Through only 600 pages of writing, Steinbeck is able to fully develop each of his few dozen characters.  Each person, whether he plays a major or a minor role, fits in the novel perfectly.  The most interesting character is undoubtedly, Lee, a Chinese cook.  Through Lee and the other characters in this novel, Steinbeck explores the important themes of love, family, trust, identity, and jealousy.  <br />Although it is a little lengthy, East of Eden is far from boring.  In every chapter, something significant happens and encourages you to read on to learn more.   The only drawback is that this novel is entirely based on the Bible and it may be difficult for non-Christians to fully appreciate Steinbeck's allusions to the Book of Genesis.

And why not, they take up an entire DVD all to themselves.  Unfortunately, the special features on the 2nd DVD are really lame!  I can't believe how cheesy the games are.  My kids played it once, and I'll bet it never goes back in the DVD player.

0140186395|4.0|John Steinbeck thoroughly demonstrates human nature within each character of this novel.  Themes such as good vs. evil, hate, jealousy, love, and family relationships are present throughout.  Steinbeck successfully retells the Biblical story of Adam and Eve in a modern version set in Salinas California.  He also manipulates the story of Cain and Abel through two generations of brotherhood.  Although there are allusions to the Bible, the foreshadowing of events is not as predictable as one may think.  One suggestion that may increase the understanding of this novel is to read the story of Adam and Eve, and the story of Cain and Abel found in the first book of the Bible: Genesis.  All in all, Steinbeck does a spectacular job in accurately referring to the Bible, and using his creativeness to capitvate the reader.
B000002R67|2.0|Why did the orignal Animals break up? Because converted hippie Eric Burdon convinced himself that aping Jimi Hendrix and San Francisco psychedelia made him more of an 'artist' than gritty, substantive R&B. Need evidence? Pick up WINDS OF CHANGE. Read Eric's front cover essay. It's the summer of love, baby, and thus no time for E.B. to get down on himself. Why? Because he \\"loves you and wants you to gain something from these new sounds, as I gained something from the saints of my past.\\" Now, open the sleeve and read the dedications (\\"Ho Chi Minh--whom I hope will listen--maybe with LBJ\\"; picture that). Then, peruse Eric's bios of his new cohorts (the patronizing profiles of Tom Wilson and John Weider smack of unintentional prejudice). Finally, listen to the contents. Nearly half of the songs are not songs at all, but monologues. The title track opens the album with a cringe as Vic Briggs lets loose with his third-rate Ravi Shankar imitation on the sitar. Enter Burdon, whose phased voice name checks every musical icon from Billie Holliday to Jimi Hendrix in a string of bad rhymes (\\"Frank Zappa zapped/Mamas and Papas knew where what was at\\") that make Nigel Tufnel's history of the Druids look positively trenchant. (Even Briggs thought it was \\"stupid\\"; read ANIMAL TRACKS) In \\"The Black Plague\\", Burdon addresses class conflict in the Middle Ages with the insight of a sixth-grade book report; once he gets to the \\"bring out your dead\\" refrain, you'll wonder if Eric Idle will take him away for nine pence. But hang loose, daddy-o, cause there's still \\"Man-Woman\\", Burdon's beatnik bongo babblefest about a crumbling relationship. Here, Eric's narrator hopes his woman will \\"pull some tricks from her feminine bag\\" to keep together a relationship squandered by his drinkin' and cheatin' (so much for detox, marriage counseling or an apology). Luckily, the rest of WINDS OF CHANGE is comprised of tracks where Burdon actually sings. His voice is in top form, as usual, but his materialis all over the place, ranging from appealing to crass to flimsy---often all in one song. Such a song is the hit \\"San Franciscan Nights.\\" After exhorting listeners to \\"save all their bread\\" and fly to the Bay Area so they can \\"understand the song,\\" Burdon eulogizes Hell's Angels, uptight cops and minorities with the help of a lilting Spanish-style acoustic guitar melody. It's a kitsch masterpiece that makes the Seeds sound hardheaded. Weider's violin enhances the drama of the clunky confessional \\"Good Times\\" and the gentle \\"Anything\\", a lovely, if slight ballad that's easily the best track on the whole LP. \\"Poem By the Sea\\" is also appealing, as Burdon indulges in hippie humility without overstaying his welcome as a gong tolls in the background. The mariachi troubadour blues of \\"Hotel Hell\\" overcomes some duff lines (\\"the cigarette blows...\\") thanks to a superb trumpet from Tony Terran. Oddly, despite their intensity as a jam band (check out ROADRUNNERS), the New Animals only rock out on three numbers--a passable, if overlong, cover of \\"Paint It Black\\"; \\"Yes I Am Experienced\\" finds Eric paying tribute to Jimi Hendrix with the restraint of a psychedelic lounge lizard; and \\"It's All Meat\\", a fierce, effects-laden blues rocker that---you guessed it---name checks Burdon's musical heroes (this time, Eric Clapton, Ravi Shankar and Roland Kirk). A must for those who prefer songs about rock stars to songs by rock stars. If anyone emerges from this album with credit, it's the aforementioned Tom Wilson, whose deft production touch creates a sparse, dark sonic atmosphere that amazingly makes even the silliest material listenable. A definite curio, WINDS OF CHANGE is filled with songs that will please the inner Austin Powers among you. Those less keen on kitsch should avoid this trip and pick up Love's FOREVER CHANGES instead.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Like the director, Chris Columbus, I believe that since the book was so well done, the movie shouldn't change anything significant.  I needn't go on about the actors, scenery, music, etc.  It's all very well done and extremely entertaining.<br />The movie itself gets 5 stars from me.<BR>My review subtracts a star for the second disk which I found extremely frustrating.  There is some very nice material included but it's so difficult to find while wading through the inconsequential filler material that it almost isn't worth it.<br />BTW - if you have a search function on your DVD player (on my remote, it is accessed through the 'Display' button) the deleted scene access screen is #77

B00005QIPH|5.0|I heard The Strokes on the radio.  I heard Last Nite and Hard To Explain.  I was impressed.  I went out and I bought this CD, and i am AMAZED.  I always liked The Strokes, and they put on a great show at the HFStival, but I never knew that they were THIS good until I bought the CD.  Is this it, The Modern Age, Soma, Barely Legal, Someday, Last Nite, Hard To Explain, and Take it or Leave it all get 10/10's.  The rest are 9's or 8's.  WOW!  I've never heard NYC cops, but i know i will one day.  Its supposed to be a great song too.  I cant wait till The Strokes come back to DC/Baltimore.  I recommend this CD to anyone....Very impressive, Mr Casablanca, VERY impressive :).
0393317552|3.0|Reading this type of book was definitely a first for me.  I've enjoyed reading various specific accounts of history, but to approach history in such an all-encompassing view definitely made me think and question some of my own thoughts and opinions.  Because of that I would definitely recommend this to others.  There are many times throughout the book that new ideas were presented and even if I didn't completely follow or believe the author's reasoning, the final conclusions oftentimes still made sense.  I did find the book to be somewhat long though, and although the author's initial questions and his opinions/hypotheses on the answers to those questions got me hooked throughout the first few hundred pages, by the end of the book I thought he was starting to be repetitive and was just waiting for it to end.  Still though just going through the process of thinking about the various questions the author proposed makes this book definitely worth your time.
B00004XONN|1.0|HUH????  I was expecting music from this CD, good music, like most Radiohead music.  But I listened to a track on this, and it sounded like something my 3 year old cousin was doing on her keyboards!  And what was up with the vocals????  It was just mumbling and none of it made sense.  The only two OK songs on this CD are optimistic and idiotheque.  MY GOD this was disappointing.  Radiohead is usually so good too.......:(
B000002UDB|3.0|The strongest songs, &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, were actually meant for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.  But there was so much material for that album, or so the legend goes, that they were convinced the two could be released as singles.  They released them as double side-As.  They were feeling confident!  And then, horror of horrors, they were kept from reaching No. 1 in Britain by Englebert Humperdinck's &quot;Please Release Me&quot;.  &quot;Penny Lane&quot; did become No. 1 in the United States, but their streak, and probably their tower, in UK was broken.  Then Eppy dies, they lose/miss his guidance and skills and they wind up with that horrible MMT movie.  They still make great songs but the albums, until &quot;Abbey Road&quot; only get goofier.  The band was on a tailspin.<br />How do I rate the album?  I got it for the two &quot;singles&quot; and got &quot;Walrus&quot; as a bonus.  Love that droning string sound as John talks about semolina pilchard.  The rest is still strong.  There are a couple No. 1s in this disc, including &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; (those backing vocals, never mind Paul) and &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;.  If you haven't got these singles in any format yet, buy this CD.
0060090367|5.0|What a wonderful book!  It was so humorous.  The characters were well-developed and lovable (as well as hateable, whichever the situation called for).  I would highly recommened it to anyone who enjoys funny, insightful, edge-of-your-seat, can't-put-it-down books.
B000002LQR|5.0|BloodSugarSexMagik is one of the best albums of the 90's. Powerful ballads, funky rockers, and the Chili Peppers' unique style makes this an essential listen. I keep rediscovering them every time I listen to this album and kick myself everytime for not having their whole catalog in my collection. Please make this your first Peppers purchase.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I waited about an hour and a half for the movie to finally start.  When I realized that it had, I spent the rest of the movie waiting for something - anything - to pull it all together.  I'm still waiting.  This is probably the most disappointing movie I have ever seen.  I like to think - I really do.  I like movies that make you puzzle out the answer.  I like the moment of revelation where everything suddenly clicks.   This movie has no answer.  I'm not even sure that it has a question.  It is simply a bunch of unrelated, badly directed scenes strung together in some incomprehensible order.  I wish I could give this movie the 0 rating it truly deserves, but that doesn't seem to be an option.
B000002MFN|3.0|Usually when Madonna doesn't try so hard, she makes something brilliant. But something so calculated as Erotica and it's coffee table companion SEX is not Madonna's best work. While SEX shouldn't even be mentioned in the review of the Erotica album, its impossible to not think of one without the other. I mean who could ever think the over priced, over hyped book was good? Sure Madonna is beautiful and looks great naked, but the awful text is straight from those letters to Penthouse. Madonna wrote like a horny teenager writing letters to her boyfriend. It was a mess if you ask me; but back to the Erotica album-the thing that matters. The title track is not her best single, but it is interesting and can rank among the album's songs worthy of mentioning. Its trippy, loopy, but fails to seduce the listener the way it intended. Much of Erotica is a tease, nowhere near as smutty as a SEX fan would expect. The suggestive titles \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" and \\"Whys It So Hard\\" are metaphors: falling in love and the need for love. It is said that \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" is about homosexuality. It would have been better if these songs were more straightforward and less mere imitations of the 1991 classic \\"Justify My love\\". Still, the disco of \\"Deeper\\" is Madonna's classic formula of effortlessness. It saves the dark album from destruction. Erotica sounds like a scorned lover's letter. \\"Bad Girl\\" tries hard to sound pitiful, but Madonna's vulnerability is not believable. This is a woman that humped a huge bed two years earlier. \\"Fever\\" is almost the fiery sex anthem that Peggy Lee's classic was-but its all about bump and grind and no feeling. There are other disasters along the way, with an occasionally good song like \\"Waiting\\" and \\"Words\\", which will never represent Madonna's best, but their druggy over the edge vibe is worth a listen. \\"Rain\\" is probably the best gem here. Its beautiful texture and warm atmosphere ranks among Madonna's best ballads. While Erotica didn't quite work for some fans, you have to respect the woman's constant experimentation and reinvention. Just think of it as a long road trip that you liked only because its over.
6304011431|5.0|This movie,to me,was one of the greatest movies I've seen. I rated it a 5 star because the story is so amazing while heartbreaking. Some of the great \\"stunts\\" are just so mind-twisting to me that I stared in amazement while watching the movie. The true fact of him being an Albino in the movie just helps the person watching the movie look more closly at the unbelievable things he does. As my mom and I watched the movie we had to grab a box of tissues. I would recommend this movie to anyone because  it shows how people act if you look different.In the movie,Jeremy,has to go to an orphanage.What he finds there are a lot of troubled people.The whole movie is based on this one guy,and what he does to change the  people that are around him.I think that the story wants to help us,as humans,to try to accept people that may look different either by skin color or eye color or whatever.I am going to end this so Good-Bye.<br />                    The End
B0000636UN|5.0|One of the great motifs of the 1960's is the life-affirming refrain, \\"Everything's all right.\\" It was echoed through the reverb, repeated through the polyphony of sound and meaning, raised to the coolest passion with staccato footsteps, crying: \\"Feel all right\\" \\"I feel all right\\" \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah,\\" \\"Well, c'mon c'mon, baby.\\" \\"C'mon C'mon, darling.\\" \\"Oh, Oh, Oh,\\" \\"ooouuu...ooouuu.\\" You know, \\"like Steve McQueen,\\" it seemed to take an \\"all American rebel\\" to enjoy this kind of encouragement against a backdrop of war, assassinations, and various forms of radical civil and social unrest. Do you see any difference, now? Well, no not exactly, says the poetess, Sheryl, between the musical lines, C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, and find the suffering agonist, who'll \\"Break my heart again/For old times sake.\\" Find the ideal,\\"You're an original, baby,\\" she can see, with the horrifying realization,\\"Turn around and you're looking at a hundred more.\\" Though contradictions abound, \\"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon,\\" she's moved to say as the thought arises,\\"I'm gonna soak up the sun/Before it goes out on me.\\" The music of the album clamors with a kind of luxury and cartoon superficiality, which doesn't seem altogether unsensible. Her voice thunders across planes of compassion in \\"Safe and Sound.\\" She bursts the scene of the 90's, through cracks of multitudinous \\"lost causes,\\" and yet manages to assemble a most colorful mosaic for the eye and ear. Sheryl Crow is as beautiful as all romantic truths we know. And through her CD, she makes it all seem virtually simple, \\"Gonna tell everyone/to Lighten Up!\\" Well, C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, pick yourself up, \\"Everything's all right!\\" Hey, you! C'mon, C'mon, C'mon the Open Road...with Kerouac, Whitman, or Steve McQueen. It's a \\"Great Escape,\\" and there's only a little ways to go.
B00004Z459|5.0|I'm a 43 year old mother of 3 who...well, probably is not technically supposed to love Linkin Park. I heard some songs on the radio and I HAD to get this CD. I love it. I hope I don't embarrass my kids when I play it full blast while driving thru the neighborhood..but I can't help it. I love the combinations of the may music genres they use in their songs. I even love the rap parts (did I say that?) Highly recommended.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Turn out the lights, hold your loved once close and be enveloped in the smooth, sultry tones of Norah who sings with a feeling that disguises her age. Great vocals. Cannot wait for her next CD.
6305077630|5.0|This is an awesome movie, but where is Amazon getting off charging [so much] for it on DVD?? I paid 20% of that for Casablanca on DVD-- which do you think is the more time-honored classic???
B000002GQL|5.0|As noted by a multitude of previous reviewers, this album was the last of the classic 7 from the Moodies from the period 1967 to 1972.  It was also, like the 6 preceding it, different from the others; \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is the most middle-of-the-road rock album of the bunch.  Very little progressive rock, no real experimentation, just plain, solid rock.<br /><br />Clearly the Moodies had become better and better at orchestrating their style of music throughout the six classic years period.  By the time they reached this album, they were fully mature in a rock style all their own, and yet fitting with the times.<br /><br />Looking back, it is difficult to see how they went from \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" to this album.  EGBDF was progressive rock with a fair amount of fantasy and science fiction.  Seventh Sojourn is very down to earth, reflecting a more mundane and earthly orientation.<br /><br />The synthesizer is a fully matured instrument in \\"Seventh Sojourn.\\"  In the Moodies' previous albums the mellotron was used for novelty and to enhance the unusual nature of their albums.  In \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" the Chamberlain replaced the mellotron, and became part of the orchestration.  The use of the Chamberlain is sometimes so subtle that I find it difficult to know when the Chamberlain is being used.<br /><br />With all these differences, the change to a more earthly orientation, a middle-of-the-road rock sound, and a new instrument, with some groups you might worry that the album was so different that it is no longer true to the group; not correct in this case.  When you listen to the classic 7 in order from \\"Days of Future Passed\\" to \\"Seventh Sojourn,\\" there is a feel of evolution, and perhaps, a feel of balance.  Sometimes I become sad when I listen to this album because I knew the group would never be the same group again.  However, as we all know, the group has continued to evolve while trying hard to stay true to their roots.  The results continually amaze me.<br /><br />Of the classic 7, this album is the least cohesive in terms of a common theme, and yet there are themes.  As noted earlier, the principal theme is the orientation back in the world as we know it.  No dreams, no people from other planets helping us; merely a recognition that this is the place and time in which we live, and darn, while we wish it would be better, it's us that has to make it better, and we can only do so much.  What more of a theme do you need?<br /><br />This album is excellent.  The themes are excellent.  The Moodies for the first time came back to earth and said:  We aren't magic; we have to focus on the real world; we are just a rock and roll group, we are as lost as you are.  These thoughts were sobering for those people that somehow thought the Moodies were gurus for a new world order.  The weren't, and didn't want to be.  \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is a reality check.<br /><br />Given all the positive comments about the album, which should be one of the best 100 rock albums of all time (and isn't, according to those narrow-minded people at VH1), it does have one flaw:  It is too short!  There are only 8 wonderful songs.  Two each from Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward, and John Lodge, one from Ray Thomas (\\"For My Lady,\\" my favorite Ray Thomas song from any album), and one that was a collaboration between Graeme Edge and Justin Hayward.<br /><br />\\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is the most polished of the classic 7, and would rank as one of the best Moodies albums by some people.  Of course, there are others that didn't care for the melancholia and mundane topics and got all bummed out and gave it a bad review, which just goes to show, you can't please everyone all the time.  I read one reviewer who hated \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" and loved \\"Seventh Soujourn.\\"  Another reviewer described EGBDF as being original and true to the group while \\"Seventh Soujourn\\" was too much pop and not the Moodies best work.  Who do you believe?  Listen for yourself.  When I'min the right mood, this album is awesome.  Other times I need something uplifting, and I listen to another group completely.<br /><br />All good groups generate controversy.  The Moody Blues are no exception (which by definition should make them a good group).  They have always defined their own path in a unique way.  \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" closed the second chapter in the story of The Moody Blues, counting \\"Go Now\\" as the first chapter.  Enjoy this album for what it was and what it is:  a good album by a great group.in the right mood, this album is awesome.

0618001905|4.0|This is a compelling read.  The author goes to great pains to demonstrate the extent to which personal greed fueled the effort by Europeans to slice up the world at the end of the nineteenth century.  If there is anyone who wonders why the West continues to viewed with a jaundiced eye by many folks in the Third World, this book will demonstrate just why that is the case.<br />The strongest parts of the book deal with the savagery employed by the Belgians to ensure the production of rubber.  Further, the book also gives a fascinating look at the private life and motives of King Leopold himself.  In many respects, he becomes the focus of the book and stands in for the general greed of white Europeans.<br />Finally, the use of missionary societies and \\"philanthropic\\" societies comes in for strong critique in this book.  While Christianity has done great good in much of the poorest parts of the world, it was shamelessly employed as a form of soft imperialism to grease the skids for the real purpose of European presence in Africa - to steal and make a profit off of other people's misery.<br />Good book. Recommended.
B000000OSE|4.0|This album is very good I don't understand why it gets bashed . Sure AFD was incredible but so is this one it's just that this is a different type of album than it's predescesor . The songs are of strong quality and the cover of Live and let Die in my opininon is better than the original  ,  I love the \\" When ya gotta job to do \\" lyrics . IF your new to GNR and think they were only about AFD then you should give this album a try you won't be disappointed .
B00006690F|5.0|Get it! The Eminem Show has shown the universe how gould hip-hop can be. Just when everyone thought that MMLP was Eminem at his best, Eminem comes out and slaps us off our barstools with his most incredible piece of work yet.<br />Not only has Eminem once again blown us away, he has evolved in so many ways. There is so much more seriousness in his music, he raps with a purpose, a meaning and an attitude. Its no longer just haha, diss everyone rhyming rap, but a mature and  influential evaluation of the state of the world. The beats are cleaner, more G-funked and just straight out awesome. <br />There is not one song on this album that i dislike. It is consisantly....perfect. Eminem raises serious issuses in his album and approaches them with sincerity and maturity. He sets the record straight with his mum in 'Cleaning Out My Closet', Raps against std's in 'Drips', admits his mistakes and details his arrests in 'Say Goodbye to hollywood' and of course declares his undying love for his daughter, Hailie Jade in 'Hailies Song'. However his old style of rapping still leaks through into songs 'Without Me' and 'My Dads gone crazy', which are little bit bizzare, but i believe they still out do MMLP.<BR>What makes eminem so controversial? He frightfully tells the truth. So if you found MMLP to be disgusting, then be prepared to be scared.<br />To top it all off, Eminem has proven himself as a real producer. Taking on the majority of the producing duties, Eminem has become quite a fine producer to make an even, non-repetitive and hair-raising album.<br />If you haven't got it yet, Get it!
B00004R99I|5.0|I have to say that &quot;Pocahontas&quot; is my favorite Disney cartoon film...and I just don't get the bad reviews for it! Yes it might not be historically &amp; politically correct (note: even the term &quot;native american&quot; is not politically correct...because &quot;native americans&quot; came from Asia!) accurate but neither were previous disney films that were considered &quot;masterpieces&quot; (those include &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot; may I go on??) The point is, you shouldn't be completely focused on what's &quot;politically correct&quot; or not. The animation is the most interesting animation Disney has done (Eat your heart out, Tarzan!!) and the music is one word: SPECTACULAR!  &quot;Colors of the Wind&quot; definatly deserved a Grammy.  Anyways, this story depicts (not historically accurate of course) the tale of Brittish settlers first coming to soon-to-be Jamestown in 1607. The opening is just fantastic and really gets you excited. I can't help but watching this movie again again...I saw it 3 times in theatres!!  It has your typical cooky and crazy disney characters (Cute &amp; playful Meeko the Racoon and Pursey the Pug, Mean and angry Captain Radcliffe &amp; his funny and somewhat dumb assistant *the animals thankfully dont talk) and your typical disney love story (this time with Pocahontas and Brittish explorer John Smith *no relation to me, hehe*...and also portrayed by brillant actor Mel Gibson).  I really reccomend this to families who haven't seen it, for everyone will enjoy it. I saw it when I was in 6th grade so it's good for all age levels. And I'd be suprised if you don't get the soundtrack to it when you're finished seieng it, for the music will leave you singing along with it! Overall, Pochahontas is my favorite disney cartoon and definatly did not deserve a 3 1/2 Star rating...rather I think it deserves 5 1/2 and my grade for it is an A++. I also reccomend the full Soundtrack to adults and the kids sing along sountrack for families with little children.<br />Thanks for reading!<br />Erice kids sing along sountrack for families with little children. <br />Thanks for reading! <br />Eric
B000002AH7|5.0|After reading some of the other reviews posted here i felt compelled to contribute to the dialogue. I believe that those from the jazz and classical 'camps' who complain that sketches of spain isn't 'really' jazz or is not faithful to the traditional orchestral approach most so-called classical recordings have taken to the adagio section of rodrigo's concerto de aranguez (the centerpiece of this album) are missing the point. This recording is one of the most important performances of the 20th century and is clearly the best in the series of collaborations between miles and gil evans. Gil evans has remarked that his arrangements were designed to provide a backdrop for miles' lyrical and passionate playing. This is indeed the case here-lush and exotic, yet not overpowering orchestrations cushion some of miles' best playing of any of his periods (cool, bebop, modal, fusion, etc.). Miles is to contemporary music what picasso was to contemporary art. This album represents uncompromising artistic expression at its highest. Sketches of spain is an absolutely essential recording, despite some less than enlightened claims to the contrary posted here. Reardless of your preference in musical expression, this recording belongs in your collection!
B00001QEBQ|5.0|I love &quot;Mulan.&quot;  I wasn't sure if it would be as good as the previous cartoon musicals I've seen (Aladdin, Lion King etc). I ended up loving it!!  I thought it was a very good message about defying the norms of society and being yourself.  a very big step for Disney.  Eddie Murphey portrays the amusing Mushu dragon who helps Mulan on her way to join the army in honor of her grandfather, who is sick and cannot fight anymore. The songs are great...especially &quot;Reflection&quot; which has beautiful lyrics (also song brilliantly by Pop singer Christina Aguilera on the sountrack).  The animation is great, and very similar to my fav movie &quot;Pocahontas.&quot;  If you loved &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and didnt get to see &quot;Mulan&quot; in theatres, then I urge you to buy it. This in my opinion is the last great film in the wave of Disney musicals (beginning of course with a classic favorite Little Mirmaid). Now we have to put up with annoying stories of ape-boys and Aliens visiting Earth (yawn). So that said, I really reccomend &quot;Mulan.&quot;  I think she is a good role model for girls and in addition the story is great! This will become a classic...and is reccomended to anyone of all ages (I was 15 when I saw it). Overall grade for &quot;Mulan&quot;: A+<br />Thanks for reading!<br />Eric
B00003CX5P|5.0|As others have pointed out, the DVD itself is spectacular.  The menus are animated with movie sequences, it's loaded with extras that are actually interesting (though a lot of them were taken from the starwars.com website).  The transfer is beautiful, the sound is the kind that makes you want to run out to your local stereo store with someone else's credit card.<BR>As for the movie itself... what needs to be said?  It has some serious flaws, but I have to say that the first few minutes had me feeling like a seven year old again, watching with awe.  Then Jar-Jar showed up and the awe vanished.
B000056N8X|1.0|I just finished watching Endgame on the recommendation of my brother.  Well, I don't know what movie he saw, but I have to say that Highlander:  Endgame is not only the worst of the four Highlander movies, it's not even good enough to be an episode of the series.<br />A lot of the other reviews point out the in the original movie (we aren't even going to discuss #2 or #3) that Connor won the prize.  That's true, but I can understand the writers and producers forgetting that little tidbit since they discovered people wanted more of the Highlander world.  But this is the worst possible way to move from Lambert to Paul.  Connor is turned from a dark brooding hero to someone who just gives up.  And as others have pointed out, Kell does not even begin to stack up as a movie villian.  <br />Frankly, the fight should have been Connor and Kell if we must follow that logic.  Connor had the grievance with Kell, Duncan didn't even know who he was until half way through the movie.  <br />And maybe I missed something, but Duncan kills his own wife to be with her forever???????  On Connor's advice??????  Please.  Someone needs to look at the series, which was decent in it's own right, and the original movie and find a better way to move from Lambert to Paul.
0142000655|5.0|Yet another powerful classic, East of Eden by John Steinbeck traces the history of the Trask and Hamilton families to their origins in California. Three generations of their stories are told through wonderful prose and imagery from the beginning until the very end.<br />Essentially, East of Eden retells the story of Cain and Abel - a biblical story. But, reader beware, you don't have to be religious to enjoy such an exquisite book. Morals lurk in every corner as Charles faces the arduous task of gaining his father's love, which his brother Adam already has. Relative to our very own lives, you'll find yourself flinching at the destruction caused by Cyrus's unwillingness to accept Charles as his son. His eager acceptance of his other son empowers the book with themes of jealousy and the struggle between good and evil. Steinbeck then manages to push his cyclical themes through into another generation of people - Adam, Aron, and Cal - who seem to share the same problem. However, the plot and evil thicken. A brothel manager named Kate seems to get caught up in the mess as well - her evil; a vice of destruction. Supplemental to the main theme of good vs. evil are hints of other themes such as timshel, and knowledge which will become self evident as the book is read. Steinbecks fascinating ability to animate characters will mesmorize you until the very end. And, surprisingly, there is even room to spare for brilliant quotes and memorable lines.<br />East of Eden is a magnificent story that'll leave you turning the pages until the end, keeping you east of eden,  ---- and wishing there was more.
B00005ABIP|4.0|I heard a song on the radio that put me in stitches. That song was \\"Rock and Roll Lifestyle\\", and for years after I never ever heard it again, and wondered many times who had penned it. It was Cake, and  just recently I finally decided to buy one of their CDs when the new \\"Comfort Eagle\\" record had been released. I figured I should start somewhere else besides their new stuff, and I remembered how much I liked \\"Sheep Go To Heaven\\" and \\"Never There\\" anyway, so I settled on Prolonging the Magic. Certainly a worthwhile stop on the road to all things Cake. Tracks 1-5 are all choice. First song is the best, \\"Satan Is My Motor\\", a laid back analogy of the authors psyche if he were a car. \\"You Turn the Screws\\" is a catchy GenX rant about corporate America. Also worth noting, \\"Hem of Your Garment\\", in which the author feels unworthy to touch a femme's said piece of clothing. Great use of the trumpet, minimalist music that doesn't grate on the ears, cynical, smart-alecky lyrics, this is a good piece of Cake.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Even though I haven't read the books and really had little interest in going to the theater to see this movie, I'm glad my wife rented it.  It was great, so great in fact that we bought the DVD.  Buy it, it's worth it.
B000056K04|3.0|Although this album is much better than most music which is being released right now, as far as the Dave Matthews Band goes, it is their worst. If you are beginning to get interested in the DMB I would suggest starting with Under the Table Dreaming (my personal favorite); however, this album does have it's high points (Everyday, When the World Ends and If I Had It All). DMB will obviously continue to impress their fans, just not always with album tracks. I also suggest trying their live albums, especially Live In Chicago.
B00004Z459|5.0|I've been listening to linkin park for a year or so now they are great. But yes they are repetitive. I love all their songs dont have a favorite only band ive ever not hated one of their songs. I listen to it about once every week but i can't listen to it more then once a day or it does get repetitive. But overall i think i will be listening to their album for years to come. can't wait for their next album!
B000002H2H|5.0|I am 19 years old now, and the first time I ever heard this album was when I was a wee lad of the age of 9. Little did I know what to expect when I embarked upon listening to this album. Fade To Black is my favorite song of all time and has been since my first few listens to this album. I have heard quite a bit of music, metal by far being my favorite genre, but I do listen to Techno, Rap, and normal Rock. I have around 300 CDs. But this one song, it is the most incredible 6:56 I have ever heard in my life. Right from the get-go, this has been my favorite song, and I imagine it always will be. The way Hetfield's vocals touch your soul, the way the guitars weave in and out of being acoustic/electric, and, of course, the killer guitar solo to close out the song. Simply incredible. This song alone makes the CD worth buying, but the other 7 songs are awesome, too (Creeping Death is another notably incredible song). Overall, I think that Puppets is their best CD, but this one is a very close second in my mind. Get it, listen to Fade To Black, and be blown away.
B000002KD9|5.0|This is the kind of album you never get tired of.  Bought it when it first came out three decades ago and am still impressed everytime I listen to it.  Great stuff here!  Also recommended &quot;Guitars, Girls &amp; Motels.&quot;
B00005R2M3|1.0|whenever wherever is about the only song i like on this album. the rest i don't care to listen at all. and how did she become  a diva anyway? i watched her sang &quot;underneath your clothes&quot; on divas las vegas, and it was a dissappointment. she sounded like her mouth is full of words, i coudn't understand what she was singing. i was like spit it out! i believe she has a talent, and most singers i think has their own style when it comes to singing, but please don't overdue it. if you have a voice show it, and don't sound like your drunk or something. if this cd doesn't play on the computer like some viewer says it won't, then i won't buy it, even if i like the cd. i play my cd on my pc most of the time. and i think i know why some new released cd's are encrpyted. well, that won't make me help buy them.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Like a lot of Bob Dylan albums, you put this one on and wonder, &quot;What was he thinking?&quot;  And after a while, you figure it out--maybe.  But in an age when most albums sound like reruns of everything you've heard before, Bobby D puts out something fresh and new.  If you don't have it, get it.  Also recommended:  &quot;Guitars, Girls &amp; Motels.&quot;
0553208845|5.0|This simply-written novel by nobel-prize winning Hermann Hesse is easy to read yet incredibly profound. The story is about the son of a Hindu priest, Siddhartha, who is living at the same time as the Buddha. Like the Buddha, he sets out on a spititual journey to discover how to cope with life's inevitable suffering, how to be satisfied with what we have, how to control our constant urges, how to be content. Siddhartha's journey has many parallels with the Buddha's--they have the same first name and both go through extreme suffering and then overindulgance in their search. However, Hesse's genius is that Siddhartha's story is brilliantly clever, profound, and ultimately supremely creative. For anyone who has asked, &quot;Why do we suffer and how can we cope with it?&quot;, for anyone studying Buddhism (although the book is not religious), for anyone struggling with the drives of the ego, this sparkling gem is truly a gift to humanity.
B00005RYKU|4.0|With the revealing trailers shown in theatres, I already knew what to expect.  I sort of just half-watched the film at the start, knowing what would happen to whom, who are the bad guys, &amp; all those sort of things.  But somewhere in the film, I suddenly found myself too engrossed &amp; too excited from the suspenseful build up &amp; was so surprised to realize that I was covering my eyes on the scenes which I supposedly 'knew' &amp; 'expected what would happen next'.<br />It has been a while since I saw a good suspense movie.  Despite the film's predictability, it was still a good watch.
0385503954|3.0|....Talk, talk, talk.<br />This should have been written as a short story or three part magizine piece. While the premise is interesting, I found that it lacked suspense and true bite. I know all the critics are raving about but I don't see it.<br />I do not even understand how the story advanced as far as it did. What kind of defense attorney did this guy hire? Briony should have ended up in prison, but the author has a quick fix for that.<br />The ending is very pat and so unsatisfying.<br />If you like &quot;wordy&quot;, you get it. Otherwise, pass on this and move on to other books.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Having read all HP books &amp; having watched the film in the theatres, I regret to say that I was sort of disappointed with the film.  I agree that with the millions of readers &amp; viewers of the HP series, it would be difficult for the cast/crew to satisfy each &amp; everyone's expectations.  So, when I got hold of the DVD, I skipped the film &amp; proceeded to see the speacial features.<br />I would say the idea of coming up with 2 discs, one for the film itself + theatrical/teaser trailers &amp; one specially for its added features is a great marketing concept.  Going through the 2nd disc made the film seem more interesting &amp; erased all my qualms --- so I ended up watching the film again --- but only after going through the 2nd disc.
B00005JKJA|4.0|The movie was interesting, frustrating, captivating, puzzling and bizarre. The other reviews can shed more light on the movie. I wanted to comment on the DVD itself. This must be the first DVD released by the manufacturer! The DVD lacks any interesting extra features and also lacks the most basic of DVD features. The worst part about the DVD is the lack of chapters. If you want to return to a part in the movie, you must fast forward through the entire movie! Hopefully, the will re-release this DVD with at least the basic DVD features.
B00003CXRP|3.0|The symbolic ending of this movie finds Tom Hanks at the dusty crossroads of a small town in Texas after returning to his job as a FedEx worker. <BR> Four years prior to this, he survived a plane crash that left him stranded in the South Pacific and presumed dead by family, friends, and colleagues.<BR> The years spent on that primitive isle are realistically boring and lonely for him. Viewers watch as a soccer ball with his bloody imprints becomes his best friend, his hair grows long, wild, and sun-bleached, and he grows mentally ill.<BR> By the time he is able to build a raft and finally free himself from his island prison, we realize how much Wilson has come to mean to him, and how Wilson has come to symbolize the human contact that Chuck so desperately craves.<BR> We feel sad that his wife, Kelly, played by Helen Hunt, didn't pay attention to her gut instincts about whether or not her husband had survived, and instead listened to friends who told her to move on with her life.<BR> This film reminds me a little of &quot;Forever Young&quot;, except that the ending leaves us hanging regarding the ultimate fate of the hero. But we know that at least now that he is back in civilization, his destiny is back in his own hands, and we wish him all the best.
B00005JKDR|5.0|First of all, let me just say that I am in my third year of college and decided the movie had a cute story behind it, so I went to see it right when it came out.  I don't usually like computer animated movies, so I was skeptical, however, I have never enjoyed a movie so much!  I can't get enough of this movie, as I have gone to see it three times already and it has taken forever for them to release it!  This movie has been a hit with all of my friends who are in their twenty's.  Way to go Disney/Pixar - I love you guys!  A must see, over and over again.  It is hilarious and heart-warming.
0790729628|4.0|The DVD version of this film is definitely worth seeing; details and images which were not discernable in the videotape version are clear as a bell here. The sound is also very clear and projects well, even on a purely stereo system. My only caveat is that the original version has not been made available; I may be swimming upstream on this one, but I enjoy the narration. First, the fact that it's a bit corny just places the film squarely in the film noire tradition, where the private detective hero frequently provides a cliche-laden voiceover. Second, it adds to our understanding of the character. Ridley Scott's contention at the time the director's cut was released that the voiceover didn't add anything to the film is simply not true and must be attributed to pre-release hype; without the voiceover, for example, we wouldn't know that Deckerd had a failed marriage in his past caused by his emotional coldness (he was as cold as sushi), which adds to our understanding of the emotional toll caused from his job as a Bladerunner. However, the director's cut does restore the original, haunting ending and provides a useful service by deleting the tacked-on and awkward sunny ending added to the film originally. All in all, a great release and a classic film.
0425152251|1.0|I would've given this book 0 stars...  This is a [bad] novel, and drags as a philosophy text.  Sophie is just there as an excuse to make this book more than just a textbook.  I thought I was reading just another text on philosophy, instead of an interesting novel...  Do you honestly want to listen to this: \\"Kant also formulates the 'categorical imperative' in this way...\\" yada yada, yawn...boring!I think gaarder, honestly, should've just written a plain philosophy textbook because that way, you get what you expect: long philosophical departures and notions.  Because gaarder attempted to lodge all this philosophy into a novel, he ends up producing a failure--a failure at a book as well as a failure as a philosophy text.  Do not buy or read this book unless your philosophy professor forces you to do so.
B000002JKS|4.0|...and this, my favourite of his solo work, was the result.<br />(Too bad Plant didn't realize that...)<br />Before he regressed back to the large, bombastic, quasi-metal, 'big hair' songs of his 'Now and Zen' period, Plant released this, his final album with his best solo band.  Robbie Blunt, Jezz Woodrooffe, and a couple of drummers you should know (some guy named Phil, and the best drummer Jethro Tull ever had) released this wonderful piece of music.<br />Experimental, innovative--but most of all fun--this record finally had Plant putting his former Zeppelin bandmates behind him, and finding a new direction, and a more contemporary voice.<br />&quot;Sixes and Sevens&quot; and &quot;Little by Little&quot; are the best songs here, carrying on the mellower feel of the previous album's &quot;Big Log&quot;, but nearly all of them are wonderful.  <br />Apparently, Plant was disappointed with this record, and if you are looking for Zeppelin-esque hubris, you will be, too.  Stick to &quot;Manic Nirvana&quot; or &quot;Fate of Nations&quot;, and steer clear of this.<br />If, however, you'd like to hear what could have been, if Plant had decided to keep his shirt on and get serious, give this disc a listen.<br />Keith.
B00000AFHM|1.0|I was heartened to see the bad review of May 8, because I was starting to wonder if the world had gone mad. \\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\" at least had some dynamic to it, something moving it forward. This is just excruciatingly fey, innocuous pap - I can imagine nothing more embarrassing than having to listen to it in a room with other people. All that recommends it is its softness, its background-musickishness.<BR>I think it appeals to people who desperately want something soft - very soft - but don't know where/how to find good soft stuff. Or perhaps they're just too shallow to \\"get\\" Nick Drake.<BR>This will probably cause howls of protest - the wimpier the band/singer, the more intolerant the fans, Morrisey's being a case in point - but if you haven't bought a B&S CD before, give the sample tracks on Amazon a good hard listen first. Ignore the hype.
B000051ZST|5.0|This is one of those movies that I could sit in front of (and do) whenever it comes on cable.  DJ Qualls is hilarious - just watch his reactions to situations.  Great ensemble cast.  You won't get anything philisophical out of this movie, but you won't care.  Tom Greene is good, but nowhere near his MTV Show antics (which, for some, may be good...)
B000065U1N|5.0|As a military member, I felt intense anger and frustration with the enemy and our own leadership.  This movie shows the selfless heroism of real Americans caught up in an impossible situation.  Yet, they went forth and fought and a \\"populace enemy\\" that outnumbered the GI's 50 to 1.  I sweat and trembled while I watched this movie.  The viewer will hear bullets whizzing like bumble bees and explosions so real that the audience winced around me as if waiting for shrapnel and debris to shower the theater.  There was complete silence in the theater after the movie finished, and then intense clapping and cheering for a great tribute to common soldiers and uncommon valor.
B00005RFAI|5.0|All I can say is WOW!  I don't care for most hip hop music or rap, so I never paid any attention to Pink.  I took notice of her talents when she participated in the remake of Lady Marmalade, but then didn't pay very much attention until I heard Don't Let Me Get Me.  The words were both meaningful and personal and it piqued my interest in her.  I went out and bought her CD and realized this young lady is incredibly talented and full of soul.  This is definitely not an album that caters strictly to the very young teeny bopper crowd.  This is an album anyone can appreciate with an open mind.  If you like Rock, Alternative Rock, R&amp;B, and Soul music, you will enjoy this album.
B00005Y228|5.0|If you like to dance be sure to get this album because it's got a lot of great tunes to dance to.  For example, &quot;On The Dance Floor&quot;, you'll feel like you're in a disco dancing like you never did before.  Then, you have the infectious tune of &quot;Can't Get You Outta My Head&quot;.  Some of her music may take some time to get used to, but it'll sound cool the more you hear it.  You should check out her Light Years album too.  It's pretty impressive.
B000067DNC|5.0|Although it has taken a long time for them to be released, these DVD's have definitely been worth the wait. Stargate SG-1 is one of the best sci-fi shows that has been around in years, taking an original and interesting premise (originally introduced in the Stargate movie, although expanded and changed a little) and weaving it into a detailed and complex storyline that continues to entertain.<BR>The second season sees Stargate SG-1 really come into it's own, finding it's feet after a mostly hit-and-miss first year. Among other things, we see the introduction of some new characters (both good and bad) this season, which adds a whole new dimension to the show and sets up some brilliant story arcs. The mythology behind the Stargate is explored a little deeper as well, allowing for some interesting discoveries and character development.<BR>Featuring such memorable episodes as The Serpent's Lair, A Matter Of Time, Holiday, 1969 and The Fifth Race, this is a collection that I will be re-watching and enjoying for a long time to come.
B0000025ZF|5.0|I've read a number of these reviews and enjoyed the sparring from various parties. Many people swear this is the best album ever, some see it as great but flawed, others ridicule the approach and output. <br />Before I start, I'll baseline my background. I worshipped Pink Floyd and identified early that Waters was the driving force. I love Gilmore's guitar work and have (and enjoy) all of his solo work but remain a Waters fan.<br />So where do I stand ? <BR>I don't think this is the technically best album ever;<BR>I think Dark Side, Wish You Were Here and Animals were all stronger albums;<BR>I think Amused to Death was Waters highest quality work;<BR>But this is my favourite.<br />Why ? Because, I value the little flaws. I enjoy the rawness of the production, the risks with the arrangements, the challenge of keeping track of the story. I don't look for singles and therefore savour the lack of accessibility of the individual songs.<br />Importantly, as much as I love Roger Waters, I enjoy the rare sentimentality of this album. Roger is a great story teller and lyricist but so often tells such a cynical story. Pros and Cons provides respite and relaxation within the Waters catalogue.<br />The magic of listening, uninterrupted, to the duration of the album and finishing with 'Every Strangers Eyes' and 'A Moment of Clarity' is a joy to behold. I challenge anyone to put down their headphones at albums end with less than a satisfied grin.
B00000J7I3|5.0|This was one of my first records in the heavy metal category, and I have been hooked since. The song LIVEWIRE opens the CD with extreme, raw, fast metal, and has the listener wanting to drive at high speeds(Caution when driving the highway). TAKE ME TO THE TOP is quick, and very melodic. The guitar work is indeed a winner, and the sound defines the metal of the 80's. STARRY EYES, PUBLIC ENEMY #1, PIECE OF YOUR ACTION, TOO FAST FOR LOVE take the rest of the cd into a fistful of attitude, which makes the listener &quot;Headbang&quot; uncontrollably. This cd in general does not dissapoint. It is raw, straight up metal, and not for the faint of heart. The front cover and inner sleeve, of the cd, pave the way for the attitude, and &quot;wildside&quot; of the 80's teenage generation(I was there).
B00005NOOH|4.0|The DVD error (duplication of disk 1, side 2, on disk 2, side 2)has been corrected. This is a great series.<BR>However, it does present a decidedly European &quot;socialist&quot; &quot;pacifist&quot; slant. In the post 9/11 world, that viewpoint is quite dated. <BR>Keeping this in mind, it is, however, an excellent series. I am giving it 4stars, only because its political premise does not stand up today.
B000063UR2|4.0|No cheesy CGI monsters here.  This is a visually stunning movie; the vivid colors and use of light vs. darkness are marvelous.  The heroine and the Devil are wonderfully cast in this Euro-dark fairy tale. Tom Cruise does a decent job in a younger incarnation... in a role far from anything you've seen him in.  A good \\"date\\" movie... something for both sexes here. The \\"making of\\" extra on the DVD is interesting (just how did they get all that stuff blowing in the wind?). Oh, and gratuitious use of unicorns, if you must know. Recommended.

B00005JKJA|4.0|First, this ain't your typical movie. It is at least 2 movies in one, and is a heckuva ride.  You'll want to watch it through first, then see parts of it again and again, as the broken pieces (hopefully) piece themselves together in your subconscious.  If you like movies like Vanilla Sky or Magnolia, this is one you don't want to miss. Recommended, unless you only like movies that go happily from point A to B to C to nicely wrapped ending. Only 4 stars, because there are no real extras on the DVD, and no chapter previews... a disappointing omission.
6305903182|3.0|Although I am not a HUGE fan of the Scream series, I still enjoyed them and have seen them all.  As most other viewers have noted, the series kind of goes downhill after the first one, and continues with, in my view, the weakest of the three with Scream 3.  To me, something just seemed different with Scream 3.  The previous two were very well acted, and you cared about the characters, and you wanted to experience things with them.  But, after viewing the third scream, I just didn't get the same sense of connection.<br />Sure, it was still entertaining to guess who the killer was, and there was always a twist, and I am not knocking the ending completely, but...because of the ending they chose, they really didn't need to make 3 screams, because this ending just kind of comes out of the blue.  They could have really just made this last one as the only scream and everything would have been fine, because the first two don't really mean anything after seeing the third.  Atleast, that is the sense I got from it.<br />Again, it is entertaining, but, the acting just falls off completely, everything seems [poor], and the actors seem to fake every scream (I am wondering though, because they are the Stab actors, maybe Craven wanted it that way, to display how fakey and cheap \\"Stab\\" was supposed to be).  I also didn't like their loud screams anytime something happened, like someone startled them, everyone was always screaming, and this tends to annoy you, and lessen the meaning of real screams, so they don't startle you as a viewer much anymore.<br />Not a bad movie, but, just didn't seem to flow with the previous two Screams.
B00003W8NM|5.0|... once you get over the violence in the film.<br />Yes, the movie contains a lot of violence and other sorts of disgusting stuff (bags of fat from a lyposuction clinic, etc.) - which is intentional, but you'd have to watch the movie a few times to get over these things and get to the points it raises.<br />I think that 'Fight Club' is somehow similar to 'Dead Poets Society' in its message about how wrong conformity is. But where 'Dead Poets Society' is very naive and is plainly from the teen age point of view, 'Fight Club' is the adult version of the same theme, more cynical and disillusioned. 'Dead Poets Society' gives you some hope when it ends, even after Neal is dead, and you see Mr. Keating leaving the classroom after being fired, because his message would 'live on' with his remaining students. While in 'Fight Club', on the other hand the ending is seemingly happy - 'Jack' has gotten Tyler 'under control' (I'm trying not to spoil this for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet), but we all realize that all the damage that's already done has to be fixed, and that the 'Space Monkeys' are still around to do some more.<br />I think the movie goes beyond showing us in what a 'rotten' society we live in. Even though Tyler tries to build a completely opposite kind of society, but instead of creating a 'perfect' society based on lessons learned from mistakes we've made, he gets a very similar society, that suffers from the same problems that ours does. Does the phrase 'group of nameless people dressed the same' describe Tyler's 'Space Monkeys' or what he sees as 'slaves with white collars'? Tyler can only give 'Jack' a view of his problems - not find a solution for them. Even when he tries, 'Jack' finds himself in the same place he started in. In one of the commentaries someone says that Marla is the equivalnet of 'Jack' only she has her life under control. Only when he makes peace with Marla, does he start to actually solve his problems, and not expect someoneelse to do it for him.
B000002MG1|5.0|What's to be said here that hasn't been said.  &quot;I have seen things you will never see...leave it to memory, me. I shudder to breathe.&quot;  This CD is pretty incomparable; it's beautiful, irreverent in places, and strikingly honest and quick to the core of life in others.  There's no accounting for taste but I still don't find it R.E.M.'s best, it probably has the best mass appeal with something for everyone, even though it doesn't come near to sounding like that's what the band was shooting for.  It was the Athens Four making music that felt right to them at the time and that comes through and rings true.<br />It probably does have the best instrumentation around and shows off the brilliance of all the band members.  Remember when Mike Mills provided those beautiful background vocals and made their music so rich.  The R.E.M. of today is a step in another direction and still is as catchy and explorative as ever, but sadly gone is the rich melody of Mills backing vocals leaving Stipe hanging fairly solo on &quot;Reveal.&quot;  But we are back to &quot;Automatic For The People&quot;...it truly is great and ranks as my 15 all-time faves, but it's behind &quot;Life's Rich Pageant&quot; and &quot;New Adventures in Hi Fi&quot; for me, but that's my taste.  The album close with &quot;Find The River&quot; and it's worth the price of admission alone.  It's the single most beautiful complete song R.E.M. has produced.  &quot;Watch the road and memorize this life that passes before the eyes...all of this is coming your way.&quot;  And Mills voice hauntingly soars in the background.  Simply beautiful.  Get this CD.  It's a must!
B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie was great! the only downer was thestoryline moved along too fast. Tobey Maguire does an excellent job of playing both Peter Parker and Spider-man.
0446310786|5.0|I'm really not the kind of person who likes these types of books. Mostly I prefer fantasy or action books. But, even though this book didn't really have a major conflict until around the middle of the book, it kept my attention throughout. This is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read. For this to be Harper Lee's first novel is amazing; it quite literally shocked me that it was so good. On the outside it seems like a simple tale of a young girl's life growing up in a small town. If you dig deeper, though, you find that it is a complex story that deals with such topics as racism. The plot is wonderfully woven in this book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read; this book is that good
6300182452|5.0|Several readers comment on the existential qualities of this movie, and they are right on. The Stranger, the character Eastwood portrays, is really something of a Nietzschen superman. He acquires this role because he possesses the attributes that the denizens of Lagos revere: courage and a quick draw. As a superman, the Stranger is able to impose his ideas and morality (or lack thereof) on Lagos. His vision--to use Nietzsche's term--for Lagos involves painting the town red, teaching the men to use guns and turning the town into a Hell for those who wronged it in the past and dare to return. This vision is scary to watch unfold, especially since the townspeople put up so little resistance considering the magnitude of the Stranger's demands. It is astonishing that the superman can so easily win over and conquer the women, religious figures and political figures of the town, thus underscoring Nietzsche's point that most people are timid and can easily be crushed and proselytized by a superman. <BR> <BR> Aside from this (probably unintentional) philosophical motif, High Plains Drifer is just plain fun to watch. Eastwood is the director, and is brilliant in the familiar role of the Stranger with No Name. The scenes in the barber's office, bar and country store are classic. In addition, the finale is dark, dramatic and demonic. <br /> Two minor flaws are worth pointing out, although they in no way detract from the experience of viewing the film. The first flaw is the confusion set up about whether the Stranger is the ghost of the slain U.S. Marshall. The movie implies--toward the very end--that the Stranger IS the ghost of the Marshall, because the Marshall's grave is open at the conclusion of the film, as if the Stranger were returning to it. Also, the Stranger has recurring visions of the Marshall being whipped, as if the Stranger has been through the experience himself. This seems to contradict the fact that the whipped Marshall looks nothing like the Stranger, and that no one in the town recognizes the Stranger, when you expect they would recognize him, if he had been through the town. I call this contradiction a flaw because it is irritating. It is impossible for the Stranger to both be and not be the ghost of the U.S. Marshall, which is what the movie leads one to believe. <BR> The other flaw is the fact that Lagos was so blatantly thrown together in one week. Half of the buildings in the town look like they would blow over if a child kicked them. In the West, miner's towns may have been constructed quickly, but I doubt that any old Western towns contained such a high percentage of rickety structures. <BR> Despite these (small) flaws, High Plains Drifter should rank as one of the best Westerns ever made. It is dark as sable cloth, but is also exciting and dramatic. A great movie that all existentialists, Eastwood fans or Western buffs should be familiar with.

0451204530|1.0|I don't know what happened to Ken Follett's writing but this book reads like it was written by a junior high school student.  It's superficial, trite, and not worth the time.  Having read some of Follett's previous books, such as Eye of the Needle and Pillars of the Earth, I had to wonder if this book was really written by him.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie has problems.  Big problems.  His classmates find him weird.  He isn't too great with the ladies.  A jet engine fell on his house.  And a giant bunny is telling him that the world's going to end in just 28 days and change.<br />Well, what can I say about this movie?  I went into this film knowing nothing more than a couple of my friends liked it and it starred the kid from \\"Bubble Boy.\\"  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I found it gripping, intriguing and all the other words you can find in the thesaurus that mean the same.<br />Richard Kelly is the man to thank for this.  He is the first time director and writer behind \\"Darko.\\"  You just got to love those rookies that come out with a movie that makes you anxious to see the next one.  The script is intelligent, very well thought out and terribly cryptic.  Now, about the characters...<br />Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal, \\"October Sky\\") is an odd little lead.  Not quite sure whether to embrace him and try to empathize or just distance yourself and try to find someone else to connect with.  Then there's the girl, the \\"love interest.\\"  Gretchen (played by Jena Malone).  We hardly know what this girl is all about, despite the information we're given.  I'm not sure if it's a script thing or an acting thing or if that's the way it's supposed to be.  We have the parents (Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell) that I would have loved to have seen more of.  The rest of the characters seemed pretty damn two-dimensional, which actually is fine by me.  This isn't a PT Anderson epic, after all.  However, I do believe that Mr. Kelly is capable of producing such an epic were he to try.<br />The film deals greatly with the subject of time travel.  Basically I'm saying get ready to open your mind a little bit and start thinking.  This isn't a \\"Back to the Future\\" type of film.  You'll be quizzed on the material later.<br />So, to recap:  I loved the movie.  I loved watching the ending and being forced to think about things.  I loved learning about a new director who obviously cares about film and puts thought into his projects.  I'm curious as to what he could do with something he didn't write.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see.  As for now, I'm going to go to sleep and hope the darkness and depression that can come from this movie doesn't consume me or give me nightmares.  What a great closing line.  See this movie.
B00005U1YO|4.0|This latest offering by the Chemical Brothers is another great, sonic excursion. This one will not &quot;set the trap&quot; as quickly as say, &quot;Surrender&quot; and requires numerous listens to gain a true appreciation.  The Brothers Chemical produce an electronica of exposition.  It takes time and effort to appreciate the amazing layering of  sound chemicals and this is especially true in &quot;Come with Us.&quot;  If you are a Chem fan, of course you'll get it.  If you are just beginning to experiment with the Chemicals, I would say, &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; and &quot;Surrender&quot; would be the best entry sequence. I believe this album indeed explores some new areas- albeit subtle ones.  &quot;Star Guitar&quot; is a brilliant one!

Well we all know now that he has put down some of the best music to come out in years. The public all to eager to pigeon hole a band, label them Altcounrty. They are in a genre all thier own, no label applies, they just make beautiful music. And YFH is no exception. Do not comapre it to Kid A, radiohead lost their way on that one, Wilco is just finding thiers. I for one ca not wait to take that trip with them
B00005K3OT|2.0|OK, I saw \\"Chocolat\\" about three times on a trans-Atlantic flight, on a small screen lodged in the seat ahead of me, with all the discomforts of air travel, so this is a review tainted by circumstances. Still, each viewing of the movie brought me nothing in the way of insights, nothing in the way of repeated pleasure.<br />This is, quite plainly, a film for women who want a feel-good experience. \\"Chacun a son goût,\\" as the French say. Speaking of the French, I suspect that the creators of this bland confection chose 1950s France (or, more precisely, small village France) to poke Catholicism in the eye. Let's just say that if Juliette Binoche had set up shop in cosmopolitan Paris, there'd be no story.<br />The visuals are nice, though. I give the film stars for making chocolate look great onscreen. But the characterizations are a bit too cardboard (the stuffy, self-righteous mayor who's harboring secret lust, the doormat wife who finds oodles of self-respect by the film's end, and the simpering deacon who delivers a nauseating PC sermon) to believe. If the feel-good aspect is all you're looking for, then why do you especially need all these vignettes about repressed people and a bunch of ragtag Gypsies?<br />All you really need is a decent box of chocolates. It'll cost less and taste better in the end.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Ok! I have to admit I wasn't exactly thrilled to recieve this album because I got it before i knew who Shakira was. Now it is like the CD always in my headphones! I really thought the songs were vivid and very well written, especially from someone with English as a second language. My favorite song is Underneath Your Clothes because I really like the lyrics and Rules because I thought it has a pretty cool chorus! So buy this album if you like pop and r&amp;b with a latin flavor.
0790733226|5.0|I'm a believer in extra-terrestrial life for the exact reason this film's characters believe in them: if we were alone, it would be a pretty large chunk of wasted space. ALIENS EXIST! this film does a masterful job at how people would react to this message received back. and there is a powerful message about faith and science being able to work together, though that message may seem a bit heavy-handed. <br />On a side note, i doubt we'd ever come into contact with aliens, and not for the lack of trying, but just because the distance is far too great. i would love it if we were to contact other beings, but it wont happen just yet.
0316286850|5.0|I've had this book for a couple years and I have to say, it's the one of the best makeup books I have.  There are so many pictures and tricks that I haven't gotten through all his tips yet.  I'm Chinese, so it's been difficult to find makeup ideas, but the ideas in this book are good for anybody!  The section on different looks are incredible - I can have a look for any occasion.  The only down side is that he doesn't list which companies make good products for his looks, but if you know makeup, or just copy down the description and bring it to a makeup counter, you'll find something that works!  Anybody who wants to play with makeup or try a different look should get this book!
6304698542|5.0|This is a great story based in Berlin at the rise of the Nazis to power. it has some wonderful songs, some of which will be familiar to many. it also has some wonderful acting, especially by Joel Grey as the MC of the KitKatKlub. While the Supporting Actor category that year was deep with wonderful performances by the trio from The Godfather, i do think Mr. Grey deserved it for his role as the MC. just wonderful.
0792844890|4.0|I'm not familiar with mr. Brooks' other movies, but I've watched Spaceballs since I was a child and it never fails to bring me down laughing.<BR>From the incredible Dark Helmet, to 'combing' the desert, it's a grand parade of laughs.<BR>If you haven't seen this, I recommend you do.<br />On the technical side, the video quality is very good, although the full-frame version is a bit worse than the widescreen, although that's understandable.<br />There're some extras on the dvd, but frankly their video quality is appalling (something like VHS) and doesn't hold a candle to the feature film. But then again, I didn't buy this dvd for the extras.<br />I missed English subtitles, because I'm not a native English speaker, but the audio quality was good and clear, even though it sometimes overwhelmed my poor hifi-set's speakers. I had little trouble keeping the music/soundeffects and speech separated.<br />May the schwartz be with ya!
B00004STDN|2.0|this movie started off really well. i love the beginning part, and was fixed on the screen as the tragedy happened on the cliffside at the beginning of the movie. but from there on, i actually lost interest. they made the first part of the film too good, so that the rest seemed paltry.
B000002UAR|5.0|Abbey Road may be better crafted, The White Album may be more consistently interesting and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band may be more of a milestone, but, song-for-song, Revolver is probably the best album The Beatles ever made. The band was really on fire here. By focusing their impeccable wit, radiating creative energy and amazing song-crafting skills on issues more complex and adult than the simple boy-meets-girl/boy-looses-girl formula that had previously monopolized pop music, The Beatles created a set of deeply felt, sincerely affecting and utterly spectacular songs. Listen to the seething empathy of \\"She Said She Said,\\" the open-hearted devotion of \\"Here There and Everywhere,\\" the droll bitterness of \\"Taxman,\\" the heart-wrenching sorrow of \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" or the drugged-up terror of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and you will clearly see that The Beatles were gushing with excellent, poignant material at this time. On Revolver, the ever-developing fab four do not, however, loose all the aspects that made their cheekier, early hits so enjoyable: wittiness, cuteness, charm and merriment (Revolver is home to a few excellent, for-fun only songs such as \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\"), but there is definitely ascendance to a whole, new plane here. Inventive, adventurous, memorable and authentic, Revolver is simply an absolutely stunning record.
B00003CWNR|2.0|i thought this film was not only not good, but definitely not oscar-nominated worthy. it was boring, simply boring. it did not draw me in to like the characters. i didnt really care what happened to them. Flash Gordon was a better movie than this one.
B00005QIPH|4.0|While most rock bands who have been playing together a mere three years are barely expected to attract more than thirty people to their next show, The Strokes were being heralded as the band that would save rock and roll from its current state of Matchbox 20-ish blandness and restore it to its former glory. On the strength of only a few years worth of gigging around their hometown of New York City, opening slots on the tours of fellow indie bands, The Doves and Guided By Voices, and just two EPs, The Strokes were being unanimously glorified by critics as the saviors of rock. Of course such a showering of adoration caused significant backlash among skeptical music fans and when The Strokes' first album, the sardonically titled Is This It?, was released in October 2001, \\"overrated\\" was the term most often used to describe it. The biggest criticism was that The Strokes are highly derivative of proto-punk bands such as The Velvet Underground, The Stooges and Television and thus not daring or inventive enough to push rock into a new era.<br />It is unfortunate that advanced hype has colored the way in which Is This It? is viewed because, despite the fact that The Strokes' influences are fairly easy to see, the album presents some excellent rock and roll. Lead singer, Julian Casablancas writes lyrics with a forceful, drunken sincerity. Listening to him bubble through regretful, self-recriminating explanations and deliberations on songs such as \\"Barely Legal,\\" \\"Trying Your Luck\\" and \\"Hard to Explain\\" is amusing and enticing. Meanwhile, the band shows a penchant for wondrous riff-rock, full of steady, thumping basslines and gorgeous guitar hooks. Their winding arrangements are somehow both abrasive and engaging. Few songs written within indie rock's aura of self-preserved unconventionalness are as catchy as \\"Take It Or Leave It,\\" \\"Last Nite\\" and \\"The Modern Age.\\" Truly, The Strokes are a talented band who have found their niche and are exploring it to its fullest.<br />Yes,they thoroughly mirror the aforementioned proto-punk legends. The Strokes are not outstanding because they are highly inventive or overly original. They are outstanding because their music is melodic, stylish and (unlike most rock music today) entirely sincere. Whether or not this combination is enough to \\"save rock\\" remains to be seen. In the meanwhile, The Strokes can be proud of making some darn good music.
6305736650|2.0|you know, i'll get like 1-300 helpful votes on this, but i didnt like this film. i honestly didnt like it. it seemed that humphrey bogart's character could do nothing but whine all the time about his love affair in paris and then get drunk at the bar. there were some powerful scenes, like when the opposing groups sang their respective nationalist songs and the ending was beautiful. but i just didnt like it. too melodramatic and humphrey whined too much.
0679721037|5.0|On August 6th, 1945, a bomb with the explosive force of 12,500 tons of dynamite was shot into the heart of the Japanese metropolis of Hiroshima. Not only did the initial blast virtually topple the city, maiming and killing tens of thousands, but the radiation unleashed by the atomic bomb inflicted countless more with radiation poisoning that caused chronic sickness and even more gruesome deaths. Less than a year after the attack, journalist, John Hersey, interviewed six survivors for a special edition of the New Yorker. The issue sparked a sensation, selling out within hours and gathering extensive acclaim from Hersey's peers. The article was sent to members of the Book-of-the-Month club as a selection and was read aloud on special radio broadcasts all across the world.<br />Reading the paperback edition of Mr. Hersey's extensive article, I had little difficulty seeing why it gathered such acclaim. He does not just take readers to the scene of the bombing; he takes them behind the eyes of those affected. Mr. Hersey temporarily disregarded the sociopolitical and moral debate concerning the atomic attack and told a straightforward, compelling and vivid story of human beings coming face to face with mammoth, almost surreal, tragedy. This new addition, featuring an additional chapter that reveals the fates of the six survivors forty years later and describes the social stigma, medical difficulties and psychological and philosophical adjustments involved in being a \\"hibakusha\\" or \\"explosion-effected person\\" only makes this journalistic triumph even better. I highly recommend Hiroshima to anyone interested in atomic warfare, World War II, Japanese culture or those who simply wish to read about the human experience at its most grave and epic.
B00003CXRP|4.0|i liked this movie and, surprisingly--since i'm a big fan of music--i really enjoyed the huge section while he is on the island where no music was being played. it gave a great sense of being away from civilization. <br />i think that the film did as well as it did was that everybody had Survivor fresh on their minds and they were still excited about someone being trapped on a deserted island. Great work Tom Hanks for taking advantage of that and making a few extra bucks! <br />my one complaint with the movie comes at the end. (dont worry there is no spoiler here--the trailer spoils it for you anyways) that is my complaint. We already knew, going into see the film, that he would make it back. it was a bit of a letdown. the ambiguity of survival would have been better left hidden in a shroud of mystery, left for the viewer to discover as he went along on the journey. the ending just seemed anti-climactic. <br />but all in all, the film was great.
B00006690F|4.0|I like this album.But my favorite MM record is still his first one.But on this album Eminem tries different things like sings on the song called \\"Halie's Song\\".I like the way Eminem gets creative in all his albums that's what makes him so different than most rappers.I tell you one thing this Whiteboy can rap his [bum] off.He changed the face of rap 4-ever.Eminem keep doing yo thang playa.Also my favorite track on this album is number 12 \\"Sing for a moment\\".The beat from the song is from a older rock song , which I forgot the name of but once you hear it you'll know you heard it before.
B00002Z83J|5.0|I'm out of words to express the sheer joy that is to listen to this absolute masterpiece by the late Rory Gallagher. Man, this album is just unbelievable!! It has some kind of magical texture, some kind of chemistry seldom witnessed in his records, in any kind of records. Of course I love all of Rory's work, but CALLING CARD is his best, period.<br />ALL THE TUNES are killer, mixturing blues, rock, jazz, funk, whatever you want.<br />Rory, wherever you are, be sure that this is your best album, and I'll listen to it always!!
B00006690F|5.0|This album is just plain amazing. It is pure showcase of all eminem's talents, in haleys song he sings in white america he raps madly and in without me he uses his slim shady persona. If you dont have this album yet i strongly sugest you go out and pick it up i gurantee you will not regret it. This cd can be listened to from beginning to end with out a dule moment. Go pick it up!!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books nor have I read any books or watched any movies about wizards and their great magic.<br />Well, make one exception..The Wizard of Oz.<br />I really had no desire to see this movie, I didn't want to read the books because I just never had any interest and they were not what I Like to read.<br />My husband rented this, and I watched with him.  It has opened my eyes to a new genre of film! (if not books)<br />&quot;Harry Potter&quot; is a fun, enchanting, and quite involved look into the world of how wizards come to learn the craft, and how they are chosen, and Harry Potter is the main character.<br />Speaking of characters, he comes across some mighty interesting ones in his quest for the stone.<br />I recommend this one for the entire family.  There may be a few close to scary momments for the young ones, but it really is great film that you can safely allow your children to view. It has something everyone can appreciate. Plus, it is fun to watch and the story is easy enough to follow. Just don't take your eyes from the screen, there is so much to see in the visually stunning movie!<br />Worth renting for the acting, which was oustanding by the whole cast, and it's special effects.
B000066744|5.0|After Cinema Paradiso, I thought Giuseppe Tornatore had peaked. Wow, was I wrong. The Legend of 1900 is a rich and moving film that is sure to capture the hearts and minds of the viewer. Tim Roth, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and Clarence Williams III, among others, perform at their very best and the soundtrack rivals any soundtrack in recent memory. With  early Jazz and Big Band tracks, the music with take you to a place and time, we seldom get to see or remember. Please do yourself a favor and watch:The Legend of 1900
B00005JKCF|5.0|This was a movie I had highly anticpated seeing once I had heard that it was in the making.<br />I grew up reading the comic strips, and watching Spidey do his wall climbing on the children's show \\"Electric Company\\".  I always thought Spiderman was one of the best super heros every created.<br />I went into the movie with a clear head, no expectations, and just planned to enjoy a night out at the cinema.<br />Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spiderman, and he did an outstanding job.  I remember how complex and sad Peter Parker was in the comic strips, and Maguire brought him to life in what I thought was the best light possible.  I can't imagine any other actor playing this role.  He was perfectly cast. Fans of Tobey Maguire, you will definitely enjoy his high energy and intensity and his Spidey moves.<br />I loved this entire film!! I wouldn't change a thing about it, and I don't have one negative thing to say about it.<br />It was fun to watch, and it kept my eyes glued to the screen as I watched Spiderman duke it out with the green goblin, played fiendishly by William Dafoe, and watched Spiderman win the girl, played by Kirsten Dunst.  I've watched her grow up on the big screen, first in \\"Interview with a Vampire\\", and most recently in \\"The Virgin Suicides\\" and \\"bring it on\\".  I think she has transitioned quite well into somewhat more adult roles than her previous work.  She is a fine actress, and I think she and Tobey had an amazing chemistry together.<br />Spiderman is worth the price of admission!! It is a visually stunning film that has great action, a great story, and great actors that all play their roles perfectly.  This was the best time I have had at the movies in a long time.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
B00000JT9E|5.0|I bought this video simply because, Slayer are the best death metal band and are one my favorites. As soon as I heard the opening song Raining Blood I knew that Live Intrusion would be the perfect video for me! The fans are out of control and the song that I think they went crazy on was War Ensemble. My favorite song and performance on this video is a full on raging fist fight between Raining Blood, War Ensemble, and Divine Intervention. The picture and camera angles are great! All Slayer fans must get a hold of this video for it doesn't just give a performance out of Hell but, also has scenes on and off the road! Go out buy this video and enjoy!
B00005JKCF|5.0|I begged my husband to take me and the kids to see Spiderman for at least a week before he finally succumbed.  I was prepared to see an only slightly upgraded depiction of the old 70's version, but was completely knocked flat by what they'd done to Spidey's web-slinging character.  I mean, he REALLY slings webbing!  It's not a device attaced to his wrist that he fills with a web chemical.  It is one of the profoundly coolest effects offered by the movie.  All that from a genetically altered spider, eh?  Makes me want to visit a lab too.<br />If you like heart-pounding action scenes, unrequited love, mystery, adventure and just a little touch of fantasy (like the fact that humans generally do not defy the law of physics and hang onto the side of a building with wee hairs on their fingertips) then this is the one you don't want to miss.  I actually made noise, a \\"wow\\" here and an \\"oooh\\" there.  It was great.  If I could talk my hubby into it, we'd go see the thing again!<br />Tobey is not one of my all time favorite actors to be sure, and I really expected his nasal, whiney-butt voice (Pleasantville) to make Spidey seem more of a lad than a grown man, but he pulled it off.  Miraculously, he pulled it off and Spidey was a masculine character after all.<br />Will be purchased on DVD when available FOR sure.
B000002B2T|5.0|Mad Season is one of the Seattle super groups to come out of the nineties.  What I find so compelling about this record are two things. Mike Mcready's bluesy at times manical guitar work and the sincerity in the late Layne Staley's voice.  Layne's vocals on this record have very little processing on them and you get to hear how truly great his voice is.  There's a truth to these songs and a passion on this record that both Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam don't always have.  Check out the track &quot;Lifeless Dead&quot;  and &quot;Above&quot; both feature Layne displaying a wail that will send chills down your spine.  With guest appearances by Mark Lanegan and a sound that is reminiscent to that of early seventies hard blues rock this album delivers.  If you love rock in its purest form GET IT!!  Not to mention Layne Stayley was one of rock n rolls most talented singers!
B00003CXI1|2.0|I haven't read the Harry Potter books, so I was coming at this movie from a relatively objective perspective.  I was looking forward to it, however, if only because I'd heard so many comparisions to Peter Jackson's mighty &quot;Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;<br />I've got to say that while Jackson's film is destined to be a classic, and it transcended the typically poor fantasy genre (see the loathesome &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; as an example), the film version of Harry Potter did not, and it will certainly be forgotten by most.  You can smell Hollywood in every frame of this picture, which is just about the worst thing one can say about a &quot;fantasy&quot; film, and unlike &quot;Fellowship,&quot; the CGI is very poorly done and calls much attention to itself.  There just isn't much imagination invested here.  Maybe if Terry Gilliam had made it, it would have had more of a genuine atmosphere...<br />For those of you who were subjected to all the comparison/hype like I was concerning these two films, forget it.  Each film has wizards and a troll, but that's where the similarities end.  Where &quot;Fellowship&quot; is an achievement and a fantastic tribute to the original books, I have to assume that the Harry Potter books are far superior to this film version!<br />And as for the extras on the DVD...terrible.  Too complicated for kids, too childish and boring for adults.
B00005YXZH|5.0|...to offest the negative reviews from people who don't see this for what it is: the best album of the year (so far) and a great addition to the American musical lexicon.
B000002U82|5.0|It is said that music charms the savage beast, if you want to relax and take it easy from the daily stresses of life, then this band is for you, In a nutshell they are like a modern day beethoven, genius.
6305907145|5.0|The book was not my favorite of Austen's.  Fanny Price always seemed like a needy wimp to me.  In Rozema's adaptation, Fanny is transformed into a strong, opinionated woman.  Rozema showed what Austen could not: the feelings of love, loneliness, hopelessness, etc.  The direction is fascinating and brilliant.  This is the movie that keeps my aspirations of directing alive.  It's a thing of beauty that haunts long after it's over.  In my opinion, it doesn't deviate that much from the book. Austen could not have written about Maria Bertram's--indiscretion--explicitly, it was the 1800s for heaven's sake.  It was implied what happened, though, and Rozema just gave the implication life.  Austen could not write passion well, seeing as how she never experienced it, so Rozema showed it for her.  Rozema also made Fanny have a little more spirit and modeled her after Austen herself, in ways.  The stories Fanny reads are Austen's, etc.  All in all, Rozema took the book and brought it to a new level of feeling.  She didn't stray that far from the original.  It was a wonderful movie that anyone should see even if Austen isn't to your tastes.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie has become one of my favorites.  I watched it because all of the mainstream movies out right now left me in need for a movie that actually required brain power to watch.  Needless to say it did.  The ending was amazing but leaving more questions in my mind then answers.  Luckily, on the DVD you can listen to the Director's commentary and he explains every scene, and best of all the ending.  <BR>     Also on the DVD there is a music video for the beautiful song that plays at the end and numerous other features that make this a must-buy.<BR>     I think that the deeper meanings in this movie are so worthwhile.  I just wish that the kids I go to school with would give this movies and those like it a chance (as compared to watching the typical teen movie of the week).
B00003CX5P|1.0|I realize that this isn't exactly original but I need to cleanse myself of the built up JJ angst that is welling inside me.  This film promised so much and delivered so little in large part because moviegoers were forced to endure that nauseatingly brutal creature and it's infuriatingly annoying voice.  There is no way in hell anyone with a light saber and the ability to use it wouldn't have decapitated that annoying piece of dung within ten minutes of meeting \\"it\\".  In the end this movie goes down as one of the biggest disappointments ever, boring, pointless and worst of all ANNOYING, you couldn't pay me to sit through another viewing of that film, I'd cover myself in honey and dive in an anthill first.  DON'T BUY IT.
6305537798|4.0|Maybe leading lady Julia Stiles 1st big role.Julia Stiles steals the show with a nasty attitude about those around her. She wants to be accepted so badly that she won't get close to anyone. She wants to be in control which leads to hateful things being said about her. For those of you who have trouble fitting in, making friends or being accepted accepted at school this is a must see.<BR>The soundtrack is lively.
0788812408|3.0|...I bought the new \\"Masterpiece\\" edition as well as the newly digitized DVD version. Upon close inspection of the copies, I noticed not only a cover difference, but footage in the new one is altered. That is to say, the DVD and Masterpiece are shortened. Towards the end of the film, where Eric is about the be married to Ursala, there is the seemingly innocuous priest, who, while giving a sermon, is wagging his \\"phallus\\" up and down. Yes, you will see that in the Classics edition, but you will be cut short if you have the DVD or Masterpiece edition.<br />...As far as Little Mermaid is concerned, I hail it as one of their masterpieces because it is the last Disney cartoon to be fully hand-drawn as well as just a great movie unto itself. The three stars are towards the Masterpiece edition of the movie, and not the Classics edition. I may be making a fuss over a small issue, and it may even seem to others right for Disney to make the change, however, I just feel Disney should not be held responsible... If Disney wanted that little bit of humor in the film, then they should leave it in there.
B00005YXZH|4.0|...It IS different.  But it's a great album.  It's mellow, that's for sure.  It's experimental, that's a given... It's goofy, but the experimentation is much what Wilco does on a lot of this album...
B000005DQR|5.0|I wrote a review a year and half ago about this CD. DJ Shadow, has crafted a masterpiece!! It ages like fine wine!!! If you happen to come across this message board, you will think to yourself \\"of course, all the fans write in.\\".  Well read the reviews carefully and you will notice with how much care everyone who has listened this album, cherishes and loves it. There is a reason for it...it is the type of album that changes your perspective in some way or another: personally, artisically, emotional, etc.  Simply, a landmark in music.
6305508550|5.0|This is a great movie, but I only reccomend it to people who have real senses of humor.  Many people have an obsession with movies like &quot;Meet the parents.&quot; A slighly funny movie.  You can solve this problem by buying them a copy of office space after hitting them in the head with a base ball bat.
B00006690F|5.0|Its MM, that much we know but it isnt the old predictable shady we all know and love... this time he has some REAL points to make, no longer blindly offending he has a directed approach and makes valid points... White America... about time someone said it this way... has to be the stand out track on the disc... cleaning out my closet is also great... Mm doesnt leave you hanging definelty a great album and if you like MM then it needs to be in your collection!!! The beats are PHAT!!!
B000002UAR|5.0|With the 1965 release of Rubber Soul, The Fab Four revealed that they were about to shed their teenybopper image. Rubber Soul was indeed a masterpiece and a work of great depth, but there were a few numbers that were remniscient of their early work. But with Revolver, The Beatles did it. Almost every track on here is a classic. Harrison's top-notch guitar playing and sharp wit come together to create a brilliant opener in Taxman. His other two songs on the album are the sitar-influenced Love You To and the introspective I Want To Tell You. Love You To is my least favorite song here, although its Eastern stylings add to the album's flavor considerably. I Want To Tell You is one of Harrison's most underrated numbers, and a favorite of mine. Lennon's work is excellent here as usual, with the rockers She Said She Said (inspired by a comment made by Peter Fonda) and And Your Bird Can Sing. Doctor Robert is a catchy little number, but I'm Only Sleeping and of course, Tomorrow Never Knows rank as Lennon's best here. But on Revolver, it's McCartney who shines brightest, with everything from the haunting (Eleanor Rigby, For No One) to the joyous (Good Day Sunshine, Got To Get You Into My Life). And then there's the beautiful Here, There, and Everywhere, in my opinion Sir Paul's finest love song. And we can't forget Yellow Submarine, a delightful ditty sung by none other than Ringo Starr.<br />Is Revolver the Beatles' crowning achievement? Maybe, and maybe not. But either way it is one of their greatest albums and one of rock music's greatest as well.

Doctor Robert is a catchy little number, but I'm Only Sleeping and of course, Tomorrow Never Knows rank as John's best here. But on Revolver, it's McCartney who shines brightest, with everything from the haunting (Eleanor Rigby, For No One) to the joyous (Good Day Sunshine, Got To Get You Into My Life). And then there's the beautiful Here, There, and Everywhere, in my opinion Sir Paul's finest love song. And we can't forget Yellow Submarine, a delightful ditty sung by none other than Ringo Starr.<br />Is Revolver the Beatles' crowning achievement? Maybe, and maybe not. But either way it is one of their greatest albums and one of rock music's greatest as well.
0783227272|3.0|Movies about historical subjects often fictionalize. Amistad has a strong ideological slant. The history it revises is available in the excellent book, Mutiny on the Amistad, by Howard Jones. A review essay in the February 1998 issue of Commentary Magazine describes the movie's bias and offers examples. Here are others. <br /> The film consistently overstates the Black and understates the White role in the effort to free the Africans: <br />1. The historical role of Dwight Janes (a white New London abolitionist) of alerting American abolitionists to the arrest of the Africans is transferred to Joadson, a fictitious black abolitionist, played by Morgan Freeman.<br />2. The historical role of Baldwin and Tappan (both white abolitionists) in requesting the help of ex-president John Quincy Adams early in the case is transferred primarily to Joadson, whose appeal is portrayed as more intellectually and morally cogent than Tappan's.<br />3. The historical role of Adams in helping defense counsel to improve their case by peppering them with legal questions is transferred to Cinque, the African leader. <br />4. The historical pressure from white public opinion in the North, widely favorable to the Africans, is omitted.<br />5. The film gives no sign of the impressive intellectual strength in the white abolitionist ranks, e.g., the speed and acumen with which central issues in the case were grasped. Within a few days of the Africans' arrest, Janes had outlined the argument in their defense that would be adopted by the Supreme Court. Within two weeks, Seth Staples and Theodore Sedgwick, white abolitionist lawyers, had addressed a memo to President Van Buren, reinforcing the Janes analysis and arguing powerfully against any executive move to take the case away from the courts. <br /> Fictions are employed to suggest that the story's blacks are sharper and wiser than the whites: <br />1. Joadson's opinion that the destruction of slavery is necessary to complete the American revolution, rudely put down by Adams at their first meeting, is echoed and vindicated by the close of Adams' argument before the Court. Here a person who never existed is represented as making an argument in a meeting that never took place, supporting a thesis that Adams never adopted.<br />2. Cinque's superb intelligence enables him to figure out what Baldwin means by drawing lines in the sand, to raise a host of possibly relevant legal points and to teach Adams the perspective that crowns his argument. The divination, the legal advice and the crowning argument were all fanciful.<br /> The film also misleads by anachronistically positing the danger of civil war if the Africans won in court: a fictitious warning by the Southern Senator John Calhoun that their release would be a long step toward war and a fictitious willingness by Adams to accept that result as completing the American revolution. This grossly exaggerates the portentousness of the case. People were not predicting or threatening civil war, despite events far more divisive than a Supreme Court decision based on the illegality of the transatlantic slave trade. The beauty of this case for the abolitionists was that the men who claimed to own these Africans were not Americans. Here actual slavery could be vigorously and triumphantly combatted by the substantial body of white opinion that considered slavery and the slave trade morally wrong, but did not wish to press abolition on the South. <br /> More important, the film creates a false impression re the kind of arguments presented to the Supreme Court in behalf of the Africans, and the basis of their victory. It suggests that the captives were freed because Adams persuaded the court to stand tall with the Declaration of Independence and the Founding Fathers. But in fact only a few seconds of Adams' eight-hour argument referred to the Declaration, and the argument that counted with the Court was made by Baldwin. <br /> According to the Court's opinion, the question was whether these Africans were owned by the Spanish claimants. The decision that they were not was based on a law and a fact: the Spanish law banning the Atlantic slave trade, and the fact of fraud in the ship's papers identifying the Africans as ladinos.<br /> The injustice of slavery is now so central to our moral code that it may be hard for people to understand how any Supreme Court decision could stop short of it, if the justices were responding to the merits. But the Court was applying the positive law of its time. It accepted the rationale argued by the abolitionists from the beginning (Janes to Baldwin, Staples and Sedgwick to Van Buren) and presented by Baldwin as his second argument. This rationale protected mutinous blacks, provided they had been illegally held as slaves. <br /> In his first argument, Baldwin sought a wider protection, a rule under which the status of a black fugitive would be determined not by the federal government but by the state to which he fled. By this proposal mutinous blacks fleeing places other than the American South could be declared free on their arrival in a free Northern state, regardless of their slave status elsewhere. But this argument (which the Court's opinion ignored) was as firmly confined to positive law as the argument that triumphed. In an early sentence, Baldwin invoked \\"the great principles of the Revolution,\\" the Declaration of Independence and \\"the genius of our institutions,\\" but he did not profess to derive his legal conclusions from these premises. <br /> Adams made JUSTICE in caps a continuing theme of his speech, but he was not thereby referring to any provision of the Declaration or any position on the morality of slavery. He was arraigning the Van Buren administration in detail and at length for favoring the Spanish claims when justice required impartiality, and for intervening in ways that justice would have barred. An ex-President exposing the machinations of the current chief executive, a former Secretary of State examining and scolding every step and misstep of the present Secretary!<br /> Yes, a helluva story - the reality much more interesting than the transmogrifications!
B00003CXI1|4.0|The movie itself is one of the best I have ever seen.  The way that they come up with the special efects are amazing.  They followed the book very closley.  The parts of the book that where cut out where not needed to tell the story even to those who haven't read the books.  Otherwise the movie would have been 4 hours.  The secound disk is some what hard to follow if you are an adult.  However this is a kids movie and it makes it fun for the kids to go through and they feel they have accomplished something when they get done.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie was not intended to be shown in one sitting.  Originally conceived as a television drama (much like Twin Peaks), it only became a film when it was not picked up for a television market.  David Lynch then re-imagined what he had already created and worked to fashion a film, seeking foreign producers and a distributor that trusted him.  While this short history of the genesis of the film does not explain its intricacies, perhaps it will help to soothe the frustrations of someone watching the film for the first time.  Can you imagine trying to piece together the entire history of the X-Files in one 3 hour sitting?  It would be difficult at best.<br />In my opinion, one big clue to the movie is in the opening shot (not the beginning credits, but the first \\"film\\" frame).  It is of a pillow and a sheet...that quickly dissolves into a rather nostalgic ride down Mulholland Drive (the road that runs behind the famous HOLLYWOOD sign).  The movie does not return the viewer to that shot ... of the pillow again until Diane wakes up nearly 5/8's of the way through the film.  It can be assumed that this whole portion of the film has been one long dream, a dream that gives us a great deal of insight into the personal desires and fantasies of Diane.  The rest of the film is a mish-mash of (in my opinion) drug-induced daydreams and paranoia, seen through the beer-bottle goggles of Diane.  She over-emphasizes the importance of things she is suspicious of, and sees things that are not really there--ultimately leading to her making some bad decisions that she cannot deal with.<br />Several characters appear in both worlds (the dream, and the warped/drug altered reality of the end).  These characters, we assume, have had some kind of impact on Diane's life.  Her fantasy/inner vision of the characters is seen in her dream, the somewhat-subjective reality of them revealed only in the latter part of the film.  There are really only two characters that are enigmas: the person behind the diner, and the cowboy.  In my opinion, the person behind the diner represents a drug dealer (making things happen) whom Diane buys from (who controls Pandora's box).  The cowboy, to me, represents the simple, logical, American person that Diane hopes is out there, striving to right the wrongs of LA.<br />The dream sequence is Diane's subconscious exploring her feelings for the people and places in her life, and rewriting her experiences in a version she likes better (she is an amazing actress, who is only deterred from certain stardom because of a conspiracy, and who loves someone that would love her fully too, if only she really knew who she was).  When she wakes up, she must then come to terms with her life, and muddle through the confusing haze of people and relationships in her life within LA culture...confusing matters incredibly with her drug/fantasy/day dream visions.<br />The movie is a masterpiece of writing, direction, cinematography, and ultimately conviction to telling an unconventional story...Lynch, Herring, Watts and others never waver in their commitment to the story...even when it gets scary, erotic, or convoluted.  The result is an incredibly entertaining and though-provoking experience that will leave you wanting to see it again and talk to others about it.  The casting is largely from television actors and recognizable faces (no doubt attributed to the fact that the film was originally going to be a television series), revealing and introducing some amazingly talented actors and actresses (Naomi Watts--clearly stretching beyond the matronly parts she has previously played, Laura Elena Harring, Justin Theroux, and Dan Hedaya in the most obvious occurrences).<br />The DVD is an interesting example of the mind of David Lynch.  It was his express directive that there be no chapter breaks in the movie.  It was also his express directive to disallow additional information beyond a cast list and the trailer.  His reasoning is that the additionalmaterial detracts from the experience of the film.  And in this case, he is right.  The additional material would allow the viewer to remove him or herself from the film, reminding them that it all was make-believe and without meaning.  In his own way, by starving the viewer of these extra tidbits, Lynch has created even more of an enigma for viewers to question well into the future.
B00006690F|4.0|... Em's writing has gone from ripping on people such as bizkit, pop groups and icp, to reflective piecesabout his mother, his success, his downfalls etc..  Cleaning out my closet has the most personal lyricseminem has ever written, and his song to hallie shows that not only can this guy rap, he aint a bad singer either.<br />I only gave this album 4 stars because I dont think every song is great.  I can listen to the marshal mathers LP from track 1 til it finishes without ever skipping around, but on this disc I go from 1 til 10, skip to 18 (til i collapse is the best song on the album) and hit 12 or 13, sometimes 14, and rarely the D12 or Dre song.  <br />The DVD that comes with the album is also quite good. It has over an hour or so worth of interviews and live footage... But like with all things I download, If i like it, I buy it.<br />So if you like Eminem, its a no brainer, pick this album up for some of his best writing and insane flows hes done to date... He mentions batman A LOT throughout the album and the chant \\"your left, your left, your left right left\\" can be heard in the two of the tracks.  Just an observation.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I walked out of this movie in the theatre, preferring instead to view it on DVD.  Having read the books, I was extemely excited about the movie.  I LOVED the introductory scene between Richard Harris and Maggie Smith.  The tone was right, there was just enough \\"magic\\" and the acting was superb.  Then the movie flash-forwarded (as does the story) to introduce the ten year-old Harry.  And Daniel Radcliffe was TERRIBLE.  Not only was he over-acting in his responses to every single situation, he was uaing an altogether incorrect response.  The Harry of the books was scared and confused by the things happening to him...at least until he arrived at Hogwarts, but Radcliffe gives Harry no surprise to find out he is a wizard...sure he says the lines, but they are uninspired and completely lifeless.<br />I would give this movie an even lower rating if it were not for the remarkable supporting cast.  Rupert Grint was DELIGHTFUL as Ron Weasley, coupling a youthful wonderment with the shyness and embarassment of an underpriveledged youth.  And Sean Biggerstaff as Oliver Wood easily comes across as the most believable character in the entire film--watch this guy, he's going to be big someday.<br />Overall the film has a gold-veneer polish that will at least make you smile at a few points, but it is not the entertaining juggernaut it has been made out to be.  Go read the books to find out what you're missing.  Let's just hope that in the next installments, Radcliffe either learns to act. or is replaced with someone who has more going for them as an actor than merely looking like the character drawn on the book covers.<br />The DVD itself is fun, incorporating an interesting (if time consuming) game on the second disk.  The DVD will appeal more to children (as per its design) than it will adults, but makes for a good rental.  You will undoubtedly want to add this to your permanent collection if you are a Harry Potter fan, otherwise, skip it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|First off, let's get a few things about the movie out of the way: <BR>1. The Force. I don't think that they used it enough. If you really watch it, the force is only used a few times in the movie. <BR>2. Medichlorians. The explanation for the way the force works is totally bogus! There should not have been ANY explanation. Nobody WANTED an explanation! <BR>3. Anakin. First of all, Jake Lloyd is a horrible actor. His high, whiny voice was annoying. There was also no evidence that he was going to become this person who is practically evil incarnate. Getting back to Jake's acting though, he didn't really use any real inflection in his voice. He'd say something like \\"Uh oh, R2, I think we're in trouble\\" like he was ordering an ice cream cone or something. Also, the part at the end where he accidentally destroys that ship is corny and stupid. <BR>4. Jar Jar. <BR>Those are the major problems I had with this. Everything else, and I really do mean EVERYTHING else was perfect. Except for the lightsaber battles, which were absolutely phenomenal. <BR>So, enough about the movie, everyone's seen it anyway. On to the DVD. Forget T2, forget Die Hard, forget EVERYTHING! Because this is simply the best DVD ever to grace the marketplace. Yes, you may have seen a hundred other reviews for a hundred other movies that flippantly say the same thing, but I'm serious. This is THE BEST DVD ever:<BR>1. Sound and video quality: Come on, this DVD comes from the guy who invented the companies THX and ILM. Is there any doubt that this is going to have the best possible sound and video? Of course not. <BR>2. The Beginning: Making Episode I. This is the best and the truest documentary ever. I say the truest because it isn't the filmmakers being interviewed about the film or anything like that, it is the ACTUAL making of the film. You see all kinds of things that went into the making of the film. Storyboarding, budget meetings, the shooting of scenes, the casting of the role of Anakin, a test screening of the movie with Lucas, McCallum, and a few other people involved in making the film, all the way up to the opening night of the movie. The best part is this documentary isn't biased or promotional, as most other purported DVD \\"documentaries\\" are. The documentary is honest and therefore, much more interesting and insightful than we would even have had a right to expect. Anyway, just let me say this: no matter how good you may think this documentary is going to be, it will be better. Oh yeah, and it ends with Lucas beginning the script to Episode II in his \\"home office\\", which is cool. <BR>3. Deleted Scenes: These are some of the best and most significant deleted scenes ever to be released on DVD since the Godfather Collection. And yet they even go beyond THAT, and add an entire half hour documentary that is specifically about the deleted scenes. Amazon has already listed what the scenes are if you look above, so I won't list them again. But, they are relevant to the movie, not just thrown in to make the DVD look good. And the accompanying documentary (telling you why directors cut scenes, and how the editing process works) is interesting also. <BR>4. Web Documentaries: If you are a big Star Wars fan, then you would have seen these already, but even so, I'm sure you'll be glad that they are included. For those who haven't seen them, they are 12 mini-documentaries that each focus on a different aspect of the movie making process. They are each just about 5 minutes long or something like that (it may be longer, I don't remember exactly), so they add over an hour more of how Episode I got made. Any fan will find these interesting. <BR>5. Featurettes: These are five little features which discuss even more about the making of this film. They cover the costumes, the fight scenes, the story, design, and special effects. These I'm pretty sure are all just under 10 minutes, so they add a little over half an hour of behind the scenes info. There is also about a 4 minutefeaturette about the making of the Star Wars: Starfighter video game, which is really more of a commercial, but still worth viewing. <BR>6. Animatics: If you are like me, you looked at the extras on this DVD, and said to yourself \\"What the hell are animatics?\\" Well, I'll tell you. Basically, it shows you how two scenes were created; from storyboard to final cut. The two scenes are the Pod Race and the Submarine sequences. Also included is a 10 minute introduction to these scenes in which the whole production process is explained. In this section of the DVD, you will also find the print advertisements for the movie, including posters and other things. Not the best part of the DVD, but interesting to go through once or twice. <BR>7. Trailers: The trailers, teasers, and TV spots are really cool in my opinion. I know that they are on every DVD, and really aren't anything that special, but I love to watch these things. In this section of the DVD you will also find the \\"music video\\" of the Duel of the Fates. This is an extremely cool extra. Trust me, you'll love it. <BR>8. Commentary: Again, I know that you have read this in many other reviews for other movies, but this is the best DVD commentary ever. It stays focused on the scenes in the movie, and doesn't go wandering about into other things that no one is even interested in hearing about. Trust me, this is one of the few commentaries that is not only worth listening to, but worth listening to MULTIPLE times.
B000063S6Z|2.0|When I first popped this CD in and listened, I loved it! But after about the third or fourth listen, I've panned everything out, and this disk is just average at best. I really wanted more out of this album, but I just can't buy Moby's pretentiousness about having recorded so many songs for this album. If he recorded 2 or 300 hundred songs for this album, I find it hard to believe he picked the best 18. This album should have been called \\"Play: the BB-sides, cuts, outtakes, and other nonsense I didn't like about my last album.\\" There are some shining moments. I personally think the song \\"18\\" is the best out of the bunch. Completely reminds me of \\"My Weakness\\" from Play. 1 or 2 others stand out, like \\"Signs of Love\\" and \\"One Of These Mornings\\", but thats really all I can listen to. I hope Moby changes his theme from Gospel on his next album. Quite frankly, I'm turned off by it. He got away with it in \\"Play\\" because it was new, but now its just repetitive and annoying. I can't recommend this album unless your a die-hard Moby fan, so I guess that counts me out...
B00005RG6M|5.0|First of all, yes the song Good Company is supposed to have that &quot;skipping sound&quot;, and second,  Everyone who loves great music should buy this disc.  It's so great, I'm even considering buying a special DVD surround sound system. Buy it!!  Every track is better than the cd or record, etc.  Although I don't really like the songs Brian May or Roger Taylor sing, it's worth it for the songs Freddie sang.

B00004XONN|4.0|OK, so its not like any of their other albums (Apart from Amnesiac), but this album will go down in rock history as one of the most influential albums since pink floyds, &quot;Dark side of the moon&quot;. A good mixture of sounds ranging from the awesome one off song, &quot;Idioteque&quot; to the chilled out, &quot;Evrything in its right place&quot;. There arent many bands brave enough to release something as totally unique as this, but radiohead have pulled it off and come out with another phenomenal album. Forget what the critics say, the more you listen to this album, the more youll grow to enjoy it and appreciate the skill and emotion that goes in to creating an album like this. Even if your not a devoted fan, youll still love this....
6304077955|5.0|this is one of those films that just lurks under the public conciousness simply because it is british.<BR>worth watching for many things. you've seen the other reviews, so you know all about thewliss' performance. but take it from me, there are other bits of value. prime cases:<BR>- the \\"end of the world is nigh, Bri\\" speech. thewliss spends 20 minutes in metaphysical discussion with intellectual security guard brian. then goes over the road and shags the woman he has been lusting after for years<BR>- the ultimate mission. thewliss' character steals a car in the single most impressive fashion i have ever seen in a film - robbing it while a couple are packing it to go on holiday even, then driving mad-cap to london where he \\"combat parks\\" the car and just keeps going!<BR>- the \\"spot the drugs\\" game. thewliss' character stays up over three days straight. count them! not once do you see him taking speed - it is not even mentioned. but he is on it - believe you me. am still hunting for a definative confirmation - but i suspect it has been left out on purpose.
B00005JKCF|5.0|We all really liked this movie, ages 3 to 70.  My teen kids have seen it 3 times now, at different theaters, tiny to mega, and still appreciate it.  The little guys, 3 & 6, had \\"met\\" Spider Man in FL a couple months ago, and have been looking forward to the movie.  It was a little scarry in some places for the littlest of the gang.  The computer graphics aficionados gave it high marks.  The photographer-wanna-be especially liked the way they portrayed him as a photographer, much better than in a couple of the cartoons they've seen.
0618001905|5.0|This very well written book open the doors of a segment of the African history unknown for most of the people.  This is a shocking research that show us how a huge area in Africa became an ivory and rubber hell where the brutality, cruelty and ambition of the Belgium king and his employees reduce the native population to a slave condition by force but also shocked me the doble morale of those people who denounced the crimes and exposed the reality of the colony and the other face of King Leopold so strongly but said nothing or almost nothing against the British, French, German and Dutch Empires that were committing the same or worst crimes in their colonies at the same time applying the same policy of robbery and cruelty as King Leopold in his Free State of Congo later known as the Belgium Congo.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Rarely have I been as prejudiced about something as I was about \\"Moulin Rouge\\": an unintellectual love story filled with clichés, people dancing in ridiculous costumes and actors singing their own lines, I thought.<br />You can probably guess that I'm not the biggest fan of the musical. However \\"Moulin Rouge\\" proved to be a huge exeption from that opinion. <br />The movie is directed by Baz Luhrman, who has also co-written it with Craig Pearce. It's not a typical musical but an exeptionally good, two-hour long music video, exept that it works better. It doesn't even try to show reality in a light way; it's pure description of an imaginary reality.<br />\\"Moulin Rouge\\" isn't a typical musical: predictable, irrelevant american movie/theater performance where characters just burst out singing, leading to the realistic plot losing it's credibility, hence making the story a \\"musical\\". It's just a dreamily unreal world, that you feel like awakening from when the film is over. On top of that the vide variety of musical segments of the film aren't just made up of separate scenes that are forcefully implanted to the story, but are rather the primary method of storytelling.<br />The movie is set in a fantasy world that somewhat resembles Paris and it's erotic cabare, the Moulin Rouge at the dawn of the 20th ceuntury. It's a tragic tale about a british poet and a prostitute, of emotions and the cruelty of the world. It's a tale straight from the romantic era of literature, but it's execution as (post-?)postmodern as it can be.<br />Baz Luhrman's directing is challenging. Artistic and unconventional enough to have made an impression to the experts of art films around the world. Writing isn't so good, but couldn't be any better if it were to fit the film that's full of symbols and dreams, giving no place to dialogue.<br />All the actors do a creat job in bringing their two-dimencional characters to life. They were reportedly instructed to overdo their performances, and if you'llwatch \\"Moulin Rouge\\" you'll understand the reason for that: without overly emotional and melodramatic performances by the actors the characters would drown in the flow of the movie.<br />And I must say that the actors do a creat job in overacting and yet conveying something deep about their purposefully stereotypical characters. Especially Nicole Kidman as the faihfull curtisane Satine manages astonishingly well in that. A lot better than her co-star, too often less-than-perfect Evan McGregor.<br />But the terms used to defy ordinary hollywood films don't apply with this musical. You see, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" isn't a film with music in it, it's music with a film in it. Sounds corny, but it's true. The idiotically stupid and predictable love-story-combined-with-tragedy-- storyline, wich is all too typical for musicals, doesn't bother at all because you don't even notice it.<br />What comes through is a breathtakingly visual storytelling combined to a working musical complexity. It's like a two hour long educational session about the history of music. The movie carries the viewer through the most well-known pieces of classical music to the hits of today, combining them to a completely functioning musical spectre. Mozart and Nirvana are one. It's all about music, not about certain types of music.<br />How long the various musical performances take of the film's time is hard to estimate, because it's hard to notice the beginnings and ends of the music scenes, if they even exist. This is why the usually so irritating singing of dialogue doesn't bother at all. You don't even notice it, so naturally it's incorporated into the fantasy world of the Moulin Rouge. When the whole movie is like a dream, unrealistic scenes don't matter.<br />On top of this, musical pieces aren't being used as complete tunes; some are heard only for a few beats, sometimes completely separate from any other music. That's why I wasn't afraid of the next overly jovial music scenes as I usually am when watching musicals. Infact, I was even surprised when I realizend one was being performed.<br />The musical scenes also vary radically in terms of tone and color and are everything but just ridiculous entertainment numbers to soften everything that's serious in the story.<br />The visual storytelling of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is exeptional. Slow-ups, speed-ups, special effects and experimental photography in complex sets are used to a breathtaking extend. And I must point out that I don't usually pay any attention to the visual quantities of a motion picture. This is mainly because they usually serve only as effects to enforce something else.<br />\\"Moulan Rouge\\", on the other hand, has left predictable plot, well performed but superficial characters and bad dialogue to stand aside. And I don't think the film would have worked any other way. \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is as good as it could possibly be, think I.<br />But the essence of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is the dreamworld created with visual art and music that's bigger than life. It has so much surface it compensates for the complete lack of depht. \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is... different.
0780624890|5.0|I have to mention upfront that I have not seen this movie on DVD yet.  I own a VHS copy, so I cannot attest to all the DVD extras, although I'm sure they are a great addition.<br />I think most of the reviews of this movie are right-on.  The night-club scene at the beginning of the film had me hooked.  The music is great, and the fight scenes are for the most part well-choreographed.<br />There have been a few reviewers who have gone on and on about vampires and how this film doesn't get them right.  Whatever.  Blade is a Marvel comic book character from the 70's (a series that ended recently, but has been begun again as a result of the popularity of the two Blade films).  Snipes plays Blade, a daywalker who has all strengths of vampires but none of the weaknesses, save one--he must control his thirst for blood.  He gained his powers as a result of his mother being bitten by a vampire while she was going into labor.  His life has been spent dedicated to eradicating vampires and searching for the one who &quot;killed&quot; his mother.<br />For all those who complain about how daywalkers can't exist, and how silver doesn't affect vampires, how vampirism is not the result of a virus, etc., I just have to say this--get real.  This is not a documentary on the myth of vampires.  We all know that vampires don't exist (except for those freaky people who like to drink blood), and since this is a horror/action flick based on a comic book, vampires can do whatever the writer and director want them to.  And I think that the movie does a great job of explaining vampirism in medical terms (of course not real, but it works for the movie).<br />For those who like action movies, don't mind gore, and like a pounding sound track to set the mood, then this is a great movie to own.  Snipes is really ripped, and his martial arts moves are top-notch.  I have watched my VHS copy so many times that the wear is starting to show.  Guess it's time to buy the DVD copy!
B00000I0XW|3.0|I fell in love with the Divine Sarah after watching the La Luna video and listening to the La Luna album!  But one of my favorite songs that is on the video, The Music Of The Night, is NOT on the CD.    So I bought this CD because it has The Music Of The Night on it.  I had no idea at that time that she had already recorded albums in many, many genres, so I expected something like LaLuna.  And this album is nothing like LaLuna.    However, it is wonderful in it's own way.  It shows her incredible diversity and unique ability to sing pretty much any kind of song.  Now, it's about time for her to do a Country and Western album!  LOL!  However, if she decided to do one, I'm sure it would be wonderful!    The only negatives about this album are the songs Gus: The Theater and Mactivity: The Mystery Cat, which leads me to believe that perhaps I simply don't like the music from Cats, but Memory is a wonderful song!
B00005NICK|4.0|This CD is just a UK only highlight's compilation into 13 tracks on 1 disc from the original Familiar To Millions 2 disc 18 track CD that was released in the USA & the UK.  It is a different color and features a sticker on the front to promote their \\"10 years of Noise and Confusion\\" mini tour of the UK.  <br />If you are a hardcore oasis fan & collector like me, you should get this one to complete your collection.  If you just want an oasis concert on CD get the original 2-disc release, or even better get the DVD, both are available on amazon.com (and are cheaper than this import!)  I gave this one 4 stars only because it was sort of re-hashing the other release, and I would give the first one 5 stars. <br />Note for collectors - It could be argued that this disc was the fist release from Noel's Big Brother label, instead of Sony/Epic having a hand in it and therefore a sort of \\"test-run\\" of the Big Brother system so that gives it more improtance!
B00005OWIU|5.0|I love the eirrie feeling this music gives you when it starts off and ends. It leaves you thinking. I've found it is especially helpful to do my homework and projects while listening to it. Even if you hate Harry Potter you are going to love this C.D.
B00006690F|5.0|\\"the eminem show\\" is a cd with a more mature approach by slim shady with songs dealing with real life situations instead of killing everyone and everything, he shows his love for his daughter, his hate of his mother and ex and tells his critics to kiss his ... . By the far the best songs are \\"cleaning out my closet\\" which he explains his problems with his mom,\\"Hallies Song' where he sings YES he sings and he's pretty good at it if u ask me but he explains how much he loves his daughter and how he would die for her. \\"Say goodbye to hollywood\\" is a song with a catchy chorus and a true look at what would happen if em wasn't has famous as he is. \\"sing for the moment\\" is a remake of aerosmiths dream on and em makes this older classic a new age hit. and lastly \\"till i collapse\\" is a song where he tells everyone he's goin to be around for a long time no matter what you try to do. So this cd is a close 2nd to the marshall mathers lp with a newer sound but a good sound any hip hop fan needs to pick this one up and actually listen to the words cuz u might learn something maybe one thing is you'll find out he know's what he's talkin about. just to let you know \\"my dad's gone crazy\\" and \\"drips are the cd's weaker songs my dad's a little 2 cute and the background sounds like the main theme from \\"ernest scared stupid\\" and drips has a good meaning but dont have a good flow besides those 2 the cd is great even the skits have something to do with the cd instead of a waste of cd this time.
0452281881|5.0|I loved this book so much I keep checking back to see if Matt Beaumont wrote anything new. In fact I bought about 15 copies to give away because I wanted to share with my friends and family. The sarcastic British humour is perfect, and the book is written all through Dilbert-y email dialogues. You get to know the characters and their quirks really well and you will not be able to put the book down. The worst thing about this book was that it had to end. I hope Matt Beaumont writes more of these funny novels...
B0000666DW|5.0|This CD is The SICKEST. Hard Fast Raw Intense I could go on But Buy It and see for Yourself. You will Love it and Tell all your freinds. And also If they come to your town go and see them I saw them last night they are SO SICK!!!...
0767842693|5.0|After reviewing a crushingly disappointing screen adaptation of a book with &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot;, I thought I'd perk up my mood with one of the best adaptations ever done.  It still amazes me how a black-and-white film can portray something that seems so incredibly real.  I'm completely convinced that the 1950's actually happened in black-and-white.  <br />This film scores magnificently in just about every way you can think.  First, the source book by Larry McMurtry was fabulous by depicting a desolate form of small-town life that somehow made you want to experience it.  While McMurtry in later years wisely went the mini-series route for many of his stories, here they did a great job with the screenplay to leave the essence of the story in.  <br />While directory Bogdonovich would make his share of klunkers in later years, it was obvious in this one that a lot of care went into the movie.  Maybe he was given more time because he was a young director, but the time was well-spent.  Once again, he took very ordinary occurrances, and made them breathe. <br />Finally, the casting was magnificent.  Except maybe for Jeff Bridges, did any of the actors make an impression in the film world anywhere near as big as this picture afterwards?  Can't really think of anything, and we're talking thirty years down the line.  <br />Sometimes you just catch lightening in a bottle.  This was one of those times.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is one of the hottest new artists out there. He will defintiely make a huge name for himslef.. if you think hes big now.. well hes just only begun! Everything about his music is just appealing and intriguing. All the melodies have that pop sense that just stays in your head the whole day.. the hooks are just really catchy. But his music is not pop by any means... it is very alternitive if you even classify it as that.  I'm a fairly new listener- only about 2 months now. But the minute I heard him, I liked him! The actual notes to the music are just really calming. even if it is a fast beat song. Even if they may sound sad, just listening to his music calms me down and actually makes me happy. Also, his lyrics are genious! They can relate to just about anybody anywhere in their own journey through life. That's because he writes his own stuff-he has thought it up from his own experience. There is none of that rhyming stuff either. Its real everyday experiences- the hard core events that mold each person to be the person they are. And he plays the guitar while sinigng!  Not that many people do that nowadays.  and hes humble.  Everyone WILL find something to like if not love, about John Mayer and his music.
0345350499|2.0|I was cautious about this book even before I read page one, because the promo page at the very front says of the main character that she has but one quest: \\"to wrest Britain away from Christianity... and the return it to the worship of the Mother Goddess.\\"<BR>This book is very well-written and it's a good tale (that's why I had to give it a 2), but there is an overt scorn for the Christian faith. Christianity is depicted as suitable for the simple and uninitiated, but the more sphisticated have their minds open to the realities of multiple gods, reincarnation, ad esp. the Mother Goddes, who is worshipped sexually. Chastity is scorned and it is said that Christians worship a \\"dead god.\\"<BR>The book is basically a tract for Wicca and promotes the neo-paganism of our day. It's obvious to one who know the Scriptures that the Druidism shown here is no different than the perverted Canaanite religion of the Old Testament, with its rituals based on sex, which Jehovah condemned and sought to eradicate. Thank God this religion was indeed banished from Britain with the coming of the Gospel.<BR>I might add also that to make her point, the author had to depict a distortion of true Christianity (just like Barbara Kingsolver did in The Poisonwood Bible). Yes, there have been and are Christians and ministers of the Gospel who emphasize law more than grace, who believe sex is wicked (instead of recognizing its sancitity in its proper place [marriage]), and who revere ritual over a relationship with the Creator, but these facets are not the essence of the true Gospel of Jesus Christ.
1567184855|5.0|This is the most amazing book I have ever read.  When I was at a point where my faith was in question, and my need to believe in life after death was strongest, I searched a number of churches and found nothing.<BR>When I read this book, it was like opening a door to knowledge and truth that has brought me tremendous comfort.  I have a friend whose 13 year old son was tragically killed in a bicycle accident.  I recommended this book to her and it has set her on a journey to learn techniques to get in touch with him and to deal with what has happened to them.  <BR>This book has made a difference in my life and the lives of family and friends who have also read it.<BR>Try it - even a skeptic has pause to reconsider after reading this book!
B000002J1U|5.0|When you talk about Rock NRoll, you talk about Led Zeppelin. <BR> Released in 1970, &quot;III&quot; is from the beggining until the end the perfect demonstration of an album with great guitar work (not only electric, but also acoustic) and great vocal interpretations. But what makes this record their best? I think the answer is in the balance that is present through the whole music in it. From the powerful &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; to the beauty in &quot;Thats The Way&quot; there is a smooth progression created by the mid-tempo rock sounds (&quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Celebration Day&quot;, &quot;Out On The Tiles&quot; or &quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot;), the dense blues of &quot;Since Ive Been Loving You&quot;, the psychadelic end track &quot;Hats Off To (Roy)Harper&quot;, or the acoustic sounds in the sweet &quot;Tangerine&quot; and the close-to-&quot;country-music&quot; &quot;Gallows Pole&quot;. This album is about maturity. <BR> When you talk about a Rock NRoll Masterpiece, you talk about &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot;. Led Zeppelin are immortal and thats what Im talkin about when refering to this record. A fundamental part of the process of have a great CD collection.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Diana Krall's impeccable musicality can only take a listerner so far before ennui takes over. If there's a missing ingredient in her musical persona, it's passion. She's the aural equivalent of a quaalude. All of these standards are tastefully rendered, virtually pristine in a tapestry of lush arrangements. The unvarying emotional tone, however, virtually smacks of minimalism. It's as if Krall is afraid of exposing some awkward, inexplicably human feeling. For another set of standards, try Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now. Unlike Krall, her good taste doesn't freeze the material.
B000063UR2|5.0|I have to say that the new Legend dvd delivers and is worth your time and money for fans of the movie and fantasy. Don't expect perfection in story and it's not free of errors but the first half of the movie is breathtaking! Second almost as good. This is not like anything you will see. It relies heavly on beauty and art I mean totally. Watch it for that only! and you will be amazed! I do think that both versions director's cut and theatrical are great but the director's is not 100% superior. Let me tell you. <BR>I think it's better because the Meg Mucklebones(a water witch) is extended and other nice seens but the new score don't make you feel for the unicorns as much, but its terrific it don't set the mood as well either but overall it is as good if not better.<BR>  The seen where Jack(Tom Cruise) finds the dead unicorn is much more heart felt with the Tangerine score and when jack walks away,<BR>regardless of the score the look he has on is face walking away from the unicorns is awesome GO RIDLEY! I have to say that the perfect movie in my humble opinion would be. Tangerine dream score most of the time with some Jerry Goldsmith in some of the seens, No song at the end, Director's cut length. There is two things unexplained still though the sword that Jack gets in the cave just disappears after he slays Meg. The director's cut still does not explain this, and how he says &quot;I know nothing of weapons&quot; and is able to sword fight Darkness at the end. I guess you have to use your imagination. That he lost his sword in the swamp. He does not have it when they get through to the to Darknesses lair. When they slide down that hill and his shield comes flying but no sword? It was overlooked I guess, does anybody else notice this? but anyway Great Movie and I love it!
0788821075|5.0|This is a Fairy Tale of a Prostitute (Julia Roberts) and a Rich Business Man (Richard Gere) who fall in love.  There it is naturally classified a romantic comedy; but the reality of it is it's so idyllic it's truly a Fairy Tale.  Very Beautiful.  Story all lovers of Romance must see it.
B00005JL3A|3.0|I have played none of the video games so I must judge Resident Evil as a movie alone, and this is a good one.  There is a disappointing beginning which sets up the movie as standard Hollywood formula (i.e. garbage). As events progress it becomes clear that the writers actually know how to make a good movie (we must keep Hollywood from killing or corrupting them!). There is a scene which looks like a formula-movie contrived ending, but it isn't the end! This gave me a letdown, followed by a swift kick; an incredibly refreshing approach to audience entertainment.  The atmosphere becomes extremely intense after the Doomed Elite Team discovers they have been lied to by their employer, the Faceless Evil Corporation. Be warned: There are a lot of cheap scares, especially with the infected bodies (zombies) and I felt that detracted from the overall effect.  I don't normally get into horror, but Resident Evil is effective. I'm already waiting for the sequel.  Wow, what a ride.
B00005OC06|2.0|If I'm not mistaken, this should be the same production as the video with the same actors and director, even though they aren't linked in this site? It was the Freni/ Domingo VIDEO I saw.<br />While this production does have possibly some of the best singing of any, I had to wonder whether the director purposely intended to make some sort of comic parody or caricature of Puccini's opera. If this was his intention, then he perhaps succeeded. A number of unfortunate choices in staging, costuming, and characterization made it all but impossible (for me, anyway) to take the characters or their tragic situation seriously. Goro looked like some great buffoonish clown, and Cio-Cio-San's mother like a vacant-minded old hag; not one of the characters seemed remotely Japanese to me. Then, there are the American and Japanese puppets Freni toys with, the child who is shown well before the dramatic revelation to Sharpless, and faithful Susuki actually ASSISTING Butterfly with the suicide! The overall effect seemed closer to farce, or mockery, than high drama and serious tragedy appropriate to the story.<br />Worst of all, for me, the consul Sharpless, presumably the moral backbone or conscience of the piece, manages to come off nearly as spinelessly degenerate as Pinkerton himself. When Goro offers to show him his selection of mail-order brides, so far from \\"laughingly declining\\"- as the script indicates- he puts on his spectacles; he asks Butterfly about whether she \\"has any sisters\\", with a grin and a twinkle that would have had me wanting to lock my own baby sister away somewhere safe (one rather wonders why he bothers to warn Pinkerton against toying with his marriage and his bride, at all); he puffs distractedly away at a cigarette while trying to read Pinkerton's letter. One of the more affecting incidental details of the 1996 film version by Mitterand (Troxell and Huang) is toward the end when Sharpless takes away a bottle from Pinkerton with which he, Pinkerton, has beendosing himself when he realizes what he's done; here, however, it is the consul who is seen fortifying himself in the crisis with the contents of a similar bottle. <br />All in all, I could not find anything in this film to recommend it- beyond, again, some excellent singing, which its negative points for me far outweighed. I found it an embarrassing travesty of Puccini's masterpiece.
B000062TU1|4.0|I usually dislike a movie that is from a book because it is usually missing a lot of important details that the book has which I know cannot be helped.  Sometimes things are changed which is a big no no!  But picking out key elements is a must have if you are going to be successful with the movie, fans, and readers.  I thought the movie did well with following the plot of the book, key elements were targeted and things that were left out weren't really needed.  The characters were very convincing and were just as I had imagined them from the book.  Other movies from books could take a few notes from this one.  I just hope they are just as successful with the next Harry Potter movie.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Thanks to exposure to some of Lynch's previous work, I anticipated being confused but ultimately sufficiently enthralled to make the movie-watching experience worthwhile.  I was disappointed.  The nonexistence of plot would not be so egregious, perhaps, had the first half of the movie not implied that some form of film noir convention would be in place.  When does a movie cross the line between being quirky and being pointless?  It does so here.
B00005MP58|4.0|I first watched the movie on PBS.  I didn't fully understand who some of the characters were and how they fit into the picture. I bought the movie so that I could watch it again.  I now understand what was going on.  I know things back then are not the way they are now, except the fact that most of the time money is everything. How did we get from there to here?  Some standards have gone down the trash. The ladies and gentlemen all talk so proper.  Lizzie is so stubborn.  But her mother got to me the most.  I found her nagging voice very irritating and the way she could change her opinion of other people so quickly so she does not look stupid to her family and friends.  Mr.Darcy is proof that you can change the first impression you give other people. But it also helps you to see that if you never tell anyone how you feel, how will you ever know how they feel.  And most of all I did get that warm and tinglely feeling at the end of the movie.
B00005A46T|1.0|this CD is more like complete garbage. These guys claim to be metal, but are nothing of real metal at all. And they even call thenselves death metal!!! You want a real death metal band? listen to DEATH or Possesed, those are real death metal. Not wannabe metal like Slipknot!
B00005ONMJ|5.0|There are others who went in great detail regarding this performance.  I will only add that this is the best Don Giovanni performance I've ever seen or heard.  Siepi is absolutely the most superb and sexiest Don ever and this is why he is so believable.  The acting of others is great too, and this is all on top of extraordinary singing.  Although I like the La Scala production with Thomas Allen, and other Dons were OK - like Raimondi and Ramey, this is an absolutely outstanding performance from all standpoints - singing, conducting, acting, costumes and everything else.  A true work of art and a must-see for opera fans.
B000001FXX|5.0|It is often said in the world of raggae music that there are bands other than Bob Marley and The Wailers out there. This is true, no doubt. But, it is also true that Bob Marley and The Wailers in their many forms are the best raggae musicians that ever lived and  that will ever exist. Their music cannot be matched because they were inventing the true spirit of raggae, not simply following a formula as musicians do today. Although Bob and his bandmates wrote a number of great songs, &quot;Natty Dread&quot; is perhaps the most complete and perfect album they put together. Anyone who considers themself to be a connesieur of music has to not only have this album, but know it inside and out. If you're just entering the world of raggae, be careful with this album. Once you listen to it, you will forever be hooked by the infectious grooves of Bob and his band. You'll never listen to music the same way again.
0553381709|1.0|At the end of the second novel I could not wait for the next book.  Now who cares? Martin has killed every character worth following in the series.  By eliminating the vast majority of characters one feels attached to in the first 2 books he leaves the reader with an emptiness that I don't see being fufilled.  The plot is now spread in so many directions that following a long complicated novel only to see who you cared for killed seems a waste of energy.  This is not to say the thought, detail, and writing are bad, quite the opposite, which makes this book all the more disappointing.  By killing or regulating the only people that one cares for to uninteresting circumstances Martin has destroyed the reason for reading the following installments.  Normally at the end of a series one looks forward too and genuinely misses the characters, but why should I care about anyone whose left?  It is a rare ability to make such a great series into something where I could stop reading right now and no longer care about the story.
B00006690F|5.0|I believe this is Em's best release...he has grown as an artist and his maturity can be heard in his lyrics. He even sings on a couple of tracks, adding variety to his former just-rap albums.<br />\\"Cleaning out my Closet\\" is the most autobiographical song Mr. Mathers has penned; a lot can be gleaned from this cut re his relationship with his mother and how he realizes his responsibilities as a father to daughter Hailey, even though he and Hailey's mother may no longer be together.<br />My favorite song, however, is the lead cut \\"White America\\"--it deals with his persecution as a rap artist while trying to defend his freedom of speech, to which we are all entitled. It's a catchy tune, it speaks the truth, and I promise you will hear it blasting from teen autos and boom boxes all summer long.
6304383827|1.0|This Hollywoodized version of \\"Emma\\" completely bastardizes the story and diminishes it in every way.  The film is more about Gwyneth than the story itself.  Even her hairdo is \\"clueless.\\" Gwyneth simply prances around \\"playing\\" the part of Emma with a \\"Look at me! Aren't I cute!\\" attitude.  She turns the film into a comedy, completely missing its finer aspects.  Low-class and cheap.

6304346107|4.0|Compared to this version, the Gwyneth Paltrow version really does appear &quot;clueless.&quot; This version of &quot;Emma&quot; is superb.  Don't waste your time with Gwyneth Paltrow.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Of course hearing &quot;Last Night,&quot; one is going to be already convinced to want to hear more of The Strokes. Let me say that maybe not all of their songs on this album measure up to the well written words, production quality of &quot;Last Night,&quot; but the rawness of most of the songs are beautiful and makes you love rock n' roll in a whole new light. It takes a good ear to hear the melody in the guitar chords, but they are there and very innovative and lovely.
0553106635|5.0|Why did it take me so long to read this series? I have been encouraged to read 'A Song of Ice and Fire' for some time and held off thinking it was a standard sword n'sorcery type epic. However, I read Martin's short story 'The Hedge Knight' in the excellent TOR anthology 'Legends 3', which was set about a century prior to A Game of Thrones and decided to give his epic a try. <BR>It was certainly worth it. This was a very hefty book, yet the story lines are actually getting tighter and the action more furious than in the previous two volumes. A word of warning though: I am not averse to starting series in the middle but I wouldn't try it with this one. A lot of the denouments in this novel are actually twists on denouments in previous books, so the full effect would be lost if the first two haven't been read. That's just beside the extreme complexity of this series which would make it difficult to pick up partway.<BR>The style is what could be termed 'historical fantasy', which other authors such as Guy Gavriel Kay and Kate Elliott, and also perhaps Robin Hobb, are having great success with at the moment. I think several of the features of this style are apparent here, such as little or no magic, a cast of thousands, a marked resemblance to a real historical period, and also the tendency to be very 'cruel' to protagonists. A number of readers of his work seem to find the main characters' spiralling loss of control over events, sometimes resulting in their death, as very difficult to deal with or otherwise very brave and skilled on the part of the author. This is really noticeable when contrasted with traditional fantasy where everything works out okay in the end, with the good guys triumphing over evil. <BR>Historical fantasy takes an approach a lot closer to real history or historical fiction: people are rarely black and white, and heroes often don't make it to the end (for example, most of Sharon Kay Penman's historical fiction sees the hero dead before the end ofthe novel, or the same in GGK's fantasy). This doesn't mean it is all without hope; invariably if a dream was worth dreaming or a mission worth undertaking, the dream will live on even after its heroes fall by the wayside, the banner caught up by others and raised again. <BR>'A song of Ice and Fire' has been said to have a War of the Roses feel; if you go into it keeping that in mind I think it doesn't seem as bleak. in the War of the Roses, the war was equally tragic for Lancastrians, Yorkists and England, and in the end Henry Tudor was probably one of the last people who should have got the disputed crown. Yet, the result of Tudor getting the crown was the sucessful Tudor dynasty, producing two of England's most famed monarchs (Henry VIII and Elizabeth I). <BR>I have no pretensions to being able to predict where this series will end up; Martin is too good at building false trails and setting up suprises. But I do feel that in the end, even if winter is coming, summer will follow after.
B00006690G|5.0|I picked up this CD 5 days ago and haven't stopped listening to it since.  Like all Eminem music, the lyrics are fascinating and although he has (surprisingly) included the lyrics to read in the CD, it's nonetheless great to hear his sound back.  Sure, there are a couple of tracks that sound like standard Shady that you've heard before, but this album definitely shows Eminem's growth as an artist in songs such as the \\"hit you over the head\\" rock-rap opener \\"White America\\", and the revealing \\"Cleaning out My Closet\\". \\"Saying Goodbye to Hollywood\\" and \\"Haylie's Song\\" give you another view of Slim and are among the most interesting tracks on the CD. Sure, \\"Without You\\" was written to be the pop smash that it is, but just when you start to think that the CD might be selling out and using old topics, he hits you with real honesty, truth, and anger that is genuine.  The only miss on the CD is \\"Drips\\" which serves no purpose and wastes the talents of Obie Trice.  Other than that, all the songs hit the mark in very different styles and ways, and I have been listening to The Eminem Show start to finish. <br />Fans of Eminem can argue which is his best work to date, but all will get into this CD.  Personally, as powerful as the Marshall Mather's LP was, I find this expansion of his sound to result in his best work to date....the best CD I've purchased this year...
B000002UEB|5.0|I have had this album for over 10 yrs and still listen to it every week.  I love all types of music from soft jazz, to country, to Metallica.  I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan, and my top 10 albums (there are probably 30 of them :)) contain a lot of Floyd albums. BUT this album is in the top 3!  This album takes you on a journey of one mans life who begins being young and swept up with rebellion, aware of the radical groups out there, so he finds himself a member in one of these extremist groups, which takes him into corruption, drugs, sex, and violence.  His life is turned inside out when told by the powers that be, to kill the woman he loves, and they run.  She is killed anyway and he falls into a dark lonely world ending up being caught and locked in a mental asylum.  Each song moves you through this sobering story, with amazing balance of energy and melancholy.  This is by FAR Queesryches best album, the songs continue from one to the next w/o pause between some are little acents to the story that are just awesome!  If you like music with lots of passion and that can take you to another place and show you amazing things YOU MUST BUY THIS CD!!!!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is a great album from an artist who promises that she has much more in store.  Yes, she is young, and her vocal range is not all that broad, but still the music on this CD is superb.  And thank you, Norah, that I don't have to look at your belly-button.  Yes, a young female singer, and she's dressed!!  That's because, she's a true singer, a musician, and an artist not a model doing videos, though she is beautiful and the video for &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; is gorgeous, just one highlight from the album.  Others include &quot;Turn Me On,&quot; &quot;The Nearness of You,&quot; the stunning &quot;Painter Song&quot; and &quot;Something Is Calling You&quot; (on the import version).
0767825411|5.0|OK, there are thousands of reasons why, I can't list them all.  The funniest part of the movie is the end and the reason I watch it sooooo many times is because of the big guy. Gozer can't even hold a candle to him (if Stay Puft got to be his own entity). <br />I like the witty dialogue between Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and co., and scene with Slimer is a classic. And all the lines are very memorable. I'd admit I was scared of this movie when it first came out (I was 7) and started liking 'Busters when the sequel came out, but this movie is much better of the two. <br />It deserves a place in your movie collection.
B00005221L|5.0|An alien from another galaxy has crash landed in an isolated jungle. Unfortunately for the big ugly thing, Arnold Schwarzenegger is in the same jungle. &quot;Dutch&quot; as Arnold refers to, has taken a squad of commandos to rescue some prisoners. After their attack on a base located in the deep jungle, the alien starts to get rid of Dutch's gang. He is the lone survivor and masters some elegant barbecue skills. Knives on sticks, powder bombs, and major logage defeat the 'Predator'. Arnold Schwarzenegger is once again a brilliant lord. The action is top notch and made me wonder if they are aliens living among us. I mean, the thing was invisible and collected skulls for fun. I was disgusted, but it reminded me of the time when I collected Power Ranger toys. A classic movie. The creature tried to devour a deity, he should've known better.
630027120X|5.0|This is a BEAUTIFUL movie. With a magnificent music score by Morricone (the Good, the Bad, the Ugly et al.), wonderful photography, we travel through the jungle and walk with the  guaranies in a particular moment of their history. The moment of their contact with the white man and their &quot;redemption&quot; by  catholic missionaries, during the brutal colonization by spaniards and portuguese.<br />On the other hand, the central line is a poignant exploration of the intimate journey of a man (De Niro) from ruthless adventurer and murderer, to humble and enlightened follower of the jesuits. His process of expiation and penance is absolutely moving, as it is set in very rugged and beautiful surroundings.<br />What a pity that we can't get it on DVD..........
B00005YW4H|5.0|...but i will try.  her voice is smokey AND sweet.  the songs are jazzy and soulful and beautiful!  this cd is among my favorites, and i am a lover of diana krall, sarah mclauchlin, natalie merchant, all the female greats... i play Norah Jones from beginning to end, over and over again.  it's the perfect background music for ANYTHING - romantic dinner, a summer afternoon alone, a rainy day indoors - it makes all occasions musically fulfilling.  i will immediately buy her next cd.
B00005R87Q|4.0|This movie was one of my most inspirational movies I've ever scene. I love cars and I have been racing them for the past few years. Racing cars is like a huge adrenaline rush and watching this movie was the same. It has all the fun and games I love like, cute guys and fast cars.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Some kind of legal thing?  Anyway, I'd like to give a vote to Tim Holt for the all-time unappreciated performance award.  He's the necessary element in this film to make it great, aside from merely being a foil to Bogie, who hams it up pretty good, you gotta admit.  Bogart's character, well, it didn't come as any surprise that the gold would work on him, but Holt's moral decay into participating in the aborted murder of Bennett, and his redemption through losing the gold, that's what this movie is all about.
0790729628|3.0|I think there is large audience out there, waiting for the origional cut to be released on DVD.  Now is the time to upgrade the soudtrack and release the version that won awards. I have seen both versions of this movie in the theater and although the origional is among my top three all time favorites, I don't want to own the directors' cut on DVD.  Release the origional cut on DVD and it is my contention it will outsell the directors' cut.
B00005NEUF|5.0|Lets forget the hype, the coolness and the clothes. This is an excellent piece of music made by five men who love their music and have been equally influenced by it. IS THIS IT is superb. The opening track, the album title is a dreamy and comforting beginning. It then quickens into The Modern Age and Soma as the band lead by Casablancas stirring vocals, Morrettis pounding drum and Valensi and Hammond Jr on soaring guitar, nicely backed by Fraiture on the bass. Barely Legal is a top track. All 11 songs are a delight to listen, it is short but it gives you an opportunity to listen to it again straight away and become sunk into the guitar and J. Casablancas.  Personal highlights are The Modern Age, Hard to Explain and Take It Or Leave It. For me it was the best album of 2001, perhaps it has given rock and roll the kick up the backside, which it needs. Last Nite has become a rock anthem and example, which other bands will have to try and better. An album for the 21st century... I'll Take It! JE
B000066NW0|5.0|Anything but ordinary is all I have to say to describe Avril Lavigne.  This album has got to be one of the best albums within the past 10 years!  From beautiful lyrics and heavy guitar rock to a hauntingly melodic voice, Avril has it all; and she's only 17! I definately recommend this album to any music lover!

0671027344|5.0|probably the best book I've read in a while. You immediately care about the main character, Charlie, who is a very kind and gifted kid who goes through some pretty odd stuff. I've forced this book on pretty much all of my friends and they have all loved it. I think Stephen Chbosky is an incredible writer, and I cannot wait for him to come out with something new!!
B000031EGV|5.0|When Alan Parrish finds an old board game in a construction site, he has no clue what awaits him.  When he and friend Sarah Whittle start to play, he is pulled into the game and she is chased from the house by bats.  Fast-forward 26 years to when brother and sister Peter and Judy Shepherd start to play.  They free a now grown Alan from the game, but in the process release monkeys, mosquitoes, and a lion.  They realize they must finish the game to make everything return to normal.  Reuniting with the adult Sarah, they attempt to stay alive long enough to do just that.<br />This movie is a fantastic fantasy/action movie.  It starts out well, and the suspense continues to build until the climax.  At the same time, it's got some great one-liners and funny scenes to break the tension.  The entire cast does well with the material, including all the special effects.  The special effects show their age today and are a bit more stylized then realistic, but they serve the movie well.<br />A word of warning to parents.  This is a very intense movie.  Even though it was marketed as a family movie, many small kids will be frightened by it.  Keeping that in mind, you might want to preview it before you show it to them.<br />This DVD is a perfect showcase for the movie.  The picture is sharp, and the surround sound puts you right in the middle of the action.

B00005Y228|5.0|I have been lucky enough to see Kylie perform at two Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parties and experience the thrill of 5,000 gay men screaming their heads off at 2am for this Aussie princess and icon. Always loyal to her audience, the Fever CD once again proves she can do no wrong. Her performance of \\"Better the Devil You Know\\" with little red devils horns and 30 male dancers in red speedos and devils horns at a Mardi Gras party is one of the memories of my pop culture infused life. Charming, having as much fun on stage as her audience, camp, coquettish and just pure pop. This album sums it all up. America, count yourself lucky Fever has relaunched Kylie in the States with a CD of pure infectious, danceable pop. A superstar here in Australia (and in the UK) for around 20 years I feel its time we share her around more. America, accept this precious gift as a sign of Australian friendship and just DANCE!<br />PS Check out the Kylie Live in Sydney DVD for the perfect concert experience.
B000002UDB|5.0|There was a time when \\"I Am the Walrus\\" (\\"No you're not,\\" said Little Nicole) was my favorite Beatles song (today it is probably \\"If I Fell\\") and I would try to cause trouble by arguing that \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" was a better album than \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\"  Hey, I was a debater, trained to argue things I did not really believe with an overwhelming passion and sometimes even convincing rationality.  Today I would just say that I think it is fairly obvious that \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" represents the high point in terms of drug use by the group.  Ironically, the two songs I can stand the least are the two \\"hits\\" from the album, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Penny Lane.\\"  I would rather hear the title track and \\"Walrus\\" again instead.<br />The album includes the lyrics for the first six songs with lyrics (that excludes the instrumental \\"Flying\\"), which were show songs from the Color Television Film, which was about four (or five) Magicians, who lived away in the sky, beyond the clouds, and who cast wonderful spells that turned the Most Ordinary Coach Trip into a Magical Mystery Tour.  Nope.  Nothing metaphorical or allegorical here.  Besides, as a bonus you have all of those in the \\"Paul is Dead\\" mystery.  Decide for yourself: \\"I buried Paul\\" or \\"Cranberry sauce\\"?  Then move on to \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" for further clues.  Pop Culture Note: There was a Batman comic where Robin investigated the death of a rock group obviously inspired by the Beatles and discovered that it was not \\"Paul\\" who was dead, but rather the rest of the group.  The fake clues were to divert attention away from the truth.  Not a bad comic book story.
0517122707|5.0|There were 519 other reviews posted before I wrote this one here, and in those you will find all you need to know about the author, the lead character Ignatius, and the setting in 1960s New Orleans. Having just finished reading it, I'll try instead to discuss the reasons why I found this book one of the most enjoyable I've ever read (and I read a lot!).<br />First, it's funny, very very funny. The writing has a sharp sarcastic wit to it, and the author weaves his take on the human condition expertly through the plot scenes, and makes great use of his characters' dialog and actions.<br />Secondly, all of the characters are very well-developed, and it's quite easy to see them, to hear them, and to get a good feel for what their inner motivations are---no small feat since there are several characters sharing the stage with Ignatius throughout the book.<br />Also, the plotline is actually several storylines moving forward simultaneously towards a single converging point at the book's climax. Each of the lesser characters' futures has a stake in the future of Ignatius (the lead) as the book careens to its finish line. The bringing together of all these separate agendas was masterfully done. I disagree with the previous reviewer's opinion that the ending wasn't up to snuff. I was happy to see that the book ended the way I wanted it to, given my 400+ page investment up to that point.<br />A rich delightful book.
0385505833|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. You understood where each character was coming from, lessons were learned, and the ending was great. Take it on a holiday.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This is a really fun CD to listen to, because it has fun and energetic songs. Shakira has a really pretty, strong voice.  Her songs are fun to sing to and have a good beat. I like the lyrics also!!
6302000823|4.0|A fatherless child in post-World War II Sicily falls in love with the movies shown at his tiny town's Cinema Paradiso, where he pesters an irrascible projectionist into teaching him the trade.  Although their relationship is initially based on a love for the audience as a community, they also develop a profound friendship that has powerful and far-reaching effects in both their lives.<br />There are several cuts of this film, and there seems to be an on-going controversy re which is best, with those who have seen the original Italian cut and the director's cut proclaiming they are greatly superior to the American version.  If that is true, they must be very fine indeed, for as it stands the more widely available American version is a brilliant film--charming, touching, and bittersweet.  Some have described this as a movie for those who love movies, but I find that only partly true; it is more a film about both community and how the people of our past make us the individuals we have become.  The direction is smooth, the cinematography memorable, and the cast--particularly Philippe Noiret as the projectionist Alfredo and Salvatore Cascio as the child determined to befriend him--is very fine.  An elegant, loving film; recommended.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is one of the finest albums I've heard in the last five years. I thought Summer Teeth was magnificent, but this easily laps it. Every time I start getting tired of Jeff Tweedy's voice, he pulls something like this out of his back pocket and rocks my little world. A simple wow should suffice.
B00005RFVL|4.0|Being a fan of the Frank Sinatra and Big Bands, I couldn't help but to take a listen to the album. All I have to say is that Mr. Williams is in top form here. I love his renditions for each track with his wonderful energy. I also purchased Robbie's one night only concert performance at the &quot;Albert&quot; and it's the best thing I've seen in a long while. Anyone should give this CD a try as well as the DVD concert. Robbie is one cool British cat that needs our love!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Sae it in Japan. This is a GREAT and I mean GREAT movie. slightly better than Mononoke. I understand Japanese so I knew what was going on. This DVD is something I really want. Spirited Away is funny, stunning, great, and probably one of the best Anime's I ever saw.
B00003CXXS|3.0|With a Jurassic Park film, state of the art special effects are a given.  Each film features cutting edge technology of various kinds bringing to the screen the most exciting, realistic and scary dinosaurs possible at the time.  On that issue, JP III delivers the goods, and this time we also get flying dinos too.  Besides the reptiles, an interesting, credible, and less predictable story would have been nice.<br />Pressured by the need for funding, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil) is improbably deceived into becoming a guide on a trip to the island Isla Sorna (Site B), by thrill seeking couple, William Macy and Tea Leoni.  The \\"Kirbys\\" are actually divorced, and are searching for their son Eric, who is apparently lost on the island, which is an unsupervised haven for Hammond's creatures.  Disaster strikes almost immediately after their plane touches down on the island, and soon the group is minus one plane and two crewmembers.  Only through the magic of film editing do the survivors manage to outrun both a T-Rex and a Spinosaur.  The survivors have cuts and abrasions after the plane crash, and it is a distraction, and continuity nightmare trying to insure that these injuries appear consistent thoughout the film.<br />If we are to believe what is presented, raptors are driven by an amazing instinct to protect their eggs.  And like man, they can kill for reasons other than for food or self-protection.  \\"Human\\" family values are also important, and young Eric is of course still alive, having survived alone for over eight weeks.  We never find out exactly what happened to Ben, who paraglided to the island with Eric.  The intimate family banter between the reconciling Kirbys might be engaging, if we really cared about them, but both characters are rather irritating, and ultimately responsible for putting everyone in danger.  The group enters an abandoned Jurassic Park facility where flying reptiles were bred.  Surprise!  The hungry pteranodons are still around, providing a new kind of dinosaur terror.  Laura Dern reprises her character from the original Jurassic Park, making a small but crucial appearance.<br />While JP III can be appreciated as a technical achievement, a well written story would have certainly been a big plus.  Well, maybe next time.  Most The DVD extras include a \\"Making of\\" feature, and a commentary track with special effects master Stan Winston, and members of the various effects teams.  This commentary is basically SE geek talk, consisting of a lot of technical information, with a hearty dose of complementary back slapping mixed in.  The dinos are after all, the real stars, and along with Sam Neil, are the main reasons to check this out at least once.ew kind of dinosaur terror.

B00003CXI1|4.0|J.K. Rowling's novels have been such a phenomenal success that the film version of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE had a built-in audience that had to be pleased--and director Chris Columbus set out to do precisely that by cramming as much of the book as possible onto the screen.  The result is a fast-paced film with arresting visuals and plenty of special effects.  But while it looks magnificent, it doesn't really capture the novel upon which it is based.<br />The problem, of course, is that Columbus and company have crammed so many of the book's details into the film that there's not much time for either story or character development: we're too busy looking at owls, shifting stairs, and the like, and it becomes somewhat difficult to keep track of the main story line and the numerous characters who support it.  Fortunately, the cast is strong enough to carry it off--the young Emma Watson is particularly enjoyable, and the main characters are supported by a host of distinctive actors whose memorable faces help keep us more or less on track.<br />Ultimately... it is a fun film, very enjoyable for adults as well as children, and you'll probably watch it several times over and enjoy it each time.  But it does not live up to its billing as &quot;the event film that doesn't disappoint,&quot; nor is it really imaginative enough to be considered &quot;the Wizard of Oz of this generation.&quot;  The second DVD has a number of add-ons designed largely for the younger set (some of them require a computer) that they will enjoy; there is little in the way of special material for the grown-ups.  Recommended nonetheless.
B000066NW0|4.0|Ok, so at first i thought this was alannis but i was wrong. To label this little rocker an Alannis Clone would be doing here a terrible disservice. Her Album is spunky and fun - full of energy and she definitely got the pipes to hold her own. Skater Boy (Sk8ter Boi) fits nicely on the shelf next to other &quot;punk-pop&quot; groups like blink182, while her balads and journal entry style songs canhave anyone relating to her. Great first album - curious about follow up potential... By the Way, i'm def. not part of her target audience but i'm enjoying the album just the same! You little punk rocker you!
0679746048|4.0|The book was an emotional story that involved the reader to a point where they felt like they were Susanna. The story taught readers about the distress of mental hospitals and how lucky peoploe are and how they should appreciate life and what they have. Susanna Kaysen brought i humor to her story to try to lighten the mood but at the same time gave the readers her perspective on life and craziness. She often asked herself what defines craziness? Am I just as crasy as the next person? Her ideas about the first interpreter vs. the second really messes with the readers mind because we can all relate to what  she was asking.Does it mean your crazy when the voice of the second interpreter doesn't interfere with the voice of the first?
0553278223|3.0|I really enjoyed The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury .It was a very interesting and at times disturbing novel.The book is about the adventures of a few different crews as they make their way to Mars.My favorite part of the book by far was the chapter entitled<BR>The Third Expedition.This chapter was about the men making their way to Mars only to find all of their dead relatives there.Like I said I really enjoyed the book but at sometimes it did drag, but i still reconmend that you read it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Nora Jones is wonderfully refreshing!  Each and every song on this album has become a favorite of mine.  She has developed a style all her own that is both entertaining and restful. It is easy to tell she has been an admirer of greats such as Ray Charles and Willie Nelson.  Her sound is smooth and elegant. I've enjoyed playing this album on road trips, at dinner parties, and during quiet evenings at home.  I never tire of it! And this coming from someone whose album library consists of mostly compilation c.d.'s and soundtracks.  Even if you are not a huge jazz fan, but are looking for excellent, restful music, you will love this album!
B0000072VM|5.0|This is the superior version of the second album from Prematia Forneria Marconi. This Italian original came out in 1972 and is not marred by the clumsy and forced Peter Sinfield lyrics which replaced the Italian words on all but one track on the English version which Emerson, Lake and Palmer released on their Manticore label in 1973. Ironically, that English album came in a gold-vanilla toned sleeve with Victorian style illustrations which captures the impressionistic feel of the music better than the interesting surrealist-influenced sleeve of the Italian import. That English version, entitled PHOTOS OF GHOSTS, also had an exquisite instrumental, OLD RAIN, which is not on this Italian release. A good album for equalizing anyone's period of melancholia, or too much Henry Cow.
B00005V1Z5|2.0|This movie is mostly just downright stupid and takes half an hour to get any good. Depending on your sense of humor you may find it hilarious to see Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson strutting and preening like a couple of peacocks and some of the movie actuallly is pretty funny, but I found it mostly embarrassing;I guess it all comes down to personal preference. However there are lots of cameo appearances (everyone from Donald Trump to Madonna) which may maintain your interest.Though if the phrase \\"stupid is as stupid does\\" sums up your personality, then you'll probably love this.

0312954468|5.0|Wow. I love this book. I've read it so many times the cover is starting to fall off. It's epic, it's fantastic, it's emotive, it's heart-wrenching, it's human, it's gory, it's everything you'd want in a book. Hell, it's so good, I wrote my A-Level music film music composition for it!!! Buy it, read it, read it again, then buy the seventh scroll and warlock and read them and then read the whole lot again! And again! OK, I need help now....
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an enchantingly lovely album.  Jone's vocals are wonderful and the cast of supporting musicians are terrific.  I looked in vain for anyone I had ever heard of, but I sure was impressed.  The songs run the gamut from things I had never heard of to standards like The Nearness of You.  My favorite was a thing called Painter Song.  I am a little reminded of a less bluesy Bonnie Raitt.  The guitar work on several of the cuts is outstanding and extremely tasteful.  Highly recommended!
B00003CXI1|1.0|I am a fan of Harry Potter and have read all the four books. I was quite disappointed when I watched this film. This film is only a &quot;trailer&quot; of the book. The story, instead of flowing smoothly and full of humor, tends to just rush and jumped from one chapter to the next one. The sense of humour is missing and to make matters worse, some important parts are not there (e.g. Hermione's role to solve the logic problem before Harry finally met the Dark Lord).<BR>This is film perhaps is only good for those who have not read the book yet.
B00005U8EM|4.0|I'm going to forego a review of the movie. Let others do that. Here's my input on the bonus stuff:<br />What's good: <BR>&quot;The weight of time&quot; documentary - What makes this documentary somewhat unique, is that it allows the screenwriter some screen time to convey what his vision of the movie would have been. It's a gutsy move that Ramis allowed this on his film, since the original concept of Groundhog Day was far darker than the final product. It's an interesting watch, although it would have been nicer if Bill Murray made an appearance in the documentary.<BR>Director's commentary: Ramis' approach is to tell small anecdotes about minor characters, how people were cast, how the scenes were filmed, etc. It's interesting and entertaining in its own right. He doesn't just drone on and on like many directors do. I think his acting and comedy background helps make him be more interesting, personable, and accessable for viewers to listen to.<br />What's lousy:<BR>I'm probably alone on this, but the animated menus are annoying, silly, and slow. You have to wait for the animation to get going before you're allowed to make your choice. It'd be forgivable if there were any easter eggs hidden, but I know of none. So, it's just annoying.
0441172717|5.0|Are you people nuts?  This movie has got it all mystery, suspense, plenty of action and even some humor.  <br />Overall-<BR>For those of you who like to see a WELL THOUGHTOUT scifi book read this  <BR>For those of you who like to study islamic culture and see what such a culture could be like in the year 26,000 read this book <BR>For those of you who like everthing good and decent about literature buy this book.  I do however advise you to stay away from the &quot;prequels&quot; of the 90s that lack both the depth and scope of the original.  I would say more but I like this book so much I would use up my alloted space.  For now I will leave you to discover the mysteries of Arakias(also known as &quot;Dune&quot;) for yourself.
B00004STPT|5.0|I heard this soundtrack before I saw the film as it had been recommended to me many times. I have never (with the possible exception of John Williams Schindler's List score) heard such emotive, original and evocative music. I've always loved good film music because of the aforementioned qualities and this is no exception. From the eerie 'Progeny' that leads through to 'Battle', Zimmer manages to convey every angle of the musical kalaedoscope. His use of the duduk in particular left me with goosebumps and my current composition is heavily influenced by this sound and 'Earth'. By using a full orchestra, with heavy and extensive percussion, the music is powerful in every track without exception. Lisa Gerrard's haunting and soulful vocals are more of an instrument than a vocal performance and add an extra dimension that most soundtracks don't have. If you're wondering whether to buy this, listen to the 'Earth', 'Progeny,' 'The Wheat', 'Battle' and 'Honour Him' track samples to get an idea of every aspect of this CD. You won't eb disappointed.

B00006690F|3.0|Beats and breaks are not Marshall's cup of tea and he proves this on his 3rd solo album, \\"The Eminem Show.\\" The velvety touches of Dre's sonic genius (barely rivaled in today's anemic pop market) grace only a few tracks. The rest of the song's beats (produced by Em himself) are passable workman-like fare, hardly worth humming.<br />Redundant kick-drums aside, the words of Marshall Mathers are hands down brilliant. By his critics, Eminem's rants are often taken for face value as 'gangsta' posturing, ignorant homophobia and frightening misogyny. To his fans, the Shady lyrics are an anthem. And somewhere in-between lies the truth.<br />With deft use of slant rhyme, repetition and irony Eminem creates an abstract, emotional portrait of his world. Not everything he says is literal and not everything he says is the truth. But everything he says should be considered for its meaning before it is dismissed. He is a witty, angry, tongue-in-cheek, unreliable narrator whose skill at breathing life into characters and situations, with the simplest turn of a phrase, rivals some of histories great writers.<br />In his work on \\"The Eminem Show\\" this dyed-blond wordsmith expresses his wicked sense of humor through scenes of anger and frustration on track after track of new music. Sure, some are better than others: \\"Cleaning out my Closet\\" is head and shoulders above \\"Superman.\\" \\"Without Me\\" & \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" are raucous, fun joints that will be enjoyed much longer than the P-Diddy-esque \\"Sing for the Moment\\" ever will be.<br />All in all, this is a darkly comedic, often violent, sometimes preachy, but always entertaining and enlightening jaunt into Eminem's mind. Some of his stances on issues and subject choices are questionable, yet then again Shakespeare was frequently bawdy, offensive and melodramatic... buy the album, you won't regret it, and after a careful listen - decide for yourself.
B00004XOWM|2.0|When the history of post-Nirvana rock is written, Chocolate Starfish will probably have a worse reputation than it deserves.  I say this because it wasn't until after Limp Bizkit put out this album that I really noticed any comparisons of nu-metal to 80's hair metal.  After seeing the heights Limp Bizkit was capable of in Significant Other, watching them crash with this one is all the more painful.  <br />What is wrong with this album?  In a word, filler.  I don't mind filler on albums, as long as it doesn't distract the listener from the good stuff.  The filler on Starfish, however, is either bad, or entertaining in its badness (like an Ed Wood film).  It sounds as though Durst realizes his conflict with his ex-girlfriend has finished, but he's still angry.  Probably the biggest mistake is starting out with \\"Hot Dog\\", Mr. Durst's ode to his favorite four-letter word.  I might have been able to forgive this, had it not been for the track that immediately follows.  I didn't expect \\"My Generation\\" to have any connection to my favorite song by The Who, but when Durst launched into the chorus with a cheap imitation of Roger Daltrey's stutter, I became so incensed that the rest of the album, was, for a intents and purposes, ruined for me.<br />Although there are some reasonably good singles (\\"Boiler,\\" \\"My Way\\"), the bad tracks make this purchase questionable for anyone who isn't already a Limp fan.
B000003TAW|5.0|Do I even need to talk about Weezer. I just wrote this review to add to my reviews page. This is the group that started my fascination with indie/emo music, even though they are more on the outskirts of the scene. Weezer's rise started back in 94/95 season and acquired a loyal fan base that has remained faithful even through the Green Album(just kidding). They have catchy, kind of pop rock songs hosted by Rivers unique vocal stylings.I don't think that there is even one bad song on this cd. I was surprised to see as many negative reviews that are posted. If you like this, I would recommend The Get Up Kids.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Assuming that you already like this movie enough to consider buying the DVD, this is a GREAT set to own.  There is a ton of extra material in this set, and it is all very interesting and informative for you if you are a Star Wars fan.<br />It is not actually one DVD, but two.  The first DVD is the movie, with the regular soundtrack, and then a very interesting commentary soundtrack with George Lucas and some of the other important players that helped bring the movie to life.  I especially liked the commentary on the sound effects -- it's interesting to hear the tricks used to make the sounds for the pod racers and the ships.  For example, they recorded a refrigerator motor and used it as the engine for one of the ships.<br />The second DVD has a short, documentary-like feature about deleted scenes.  There was an entire lap of the pod race cut out that you will get to see.  Lots of commentary goes with each deleted scene, including how it was made, and why it was cut out.<br />The second DVD also has a made-for-DVD documentary about the making of the movie.  It shows basically everything from the Anakin Skywalker tryouts to the very first screening.  It includes a lot of behind-the-scenes look at how the animation was done.  It shows the lightsaber fight at the end being rehearsed and shot too.  Great stuff.<br />And of course, the DVD includes the obligatory trailers.  Those are always fun to watch.<br />If you are a big Star Wars fan, or if you just liked this movie, then this one is a can't miss.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer knows what it is to be 25--a refreshing singer amidst the teenie-boppers and the 30-year olds whose mostly down-home ballads hit home.  I highly recommend this CD--it hasn't left my CD player in weeks.
0140186395|4.0|This unique novel places the Old Testament in Salinas Valley in the early 20th century.  The book's apeal lies in the combination of alluring characters and pictorial descriptions of the California setting.  Powerful displays of human emotions--ranging from unconditional love to hatred--are hallmarks of the characters and key to the insightful value of the book.  This wisdom is as compelling as the characters that reveal it--or fail to see it.  The characters are a great highlight of the book--Steinbeck leads the reader to feel the same emotions as his characters.  This Nobel Prize winning novel promises and entertaining and enlightening read.
B00005QCYC|5.0|These movies are great fun, the sequels are sort of weak story wise but still get the job done entertainment wise. I think for the 4th one that here Spielberg might be doing, they need a fresher story. I think they should just go ahead and make Jurassic Park an actual theme park already and dump the whole &quot;I hate this island but I'm here anyway bit&quot;.  The whole theme park thing would be cool and would allow just regular people there and not just scientists or hunters like in the others.  Of course one or 2 actors from the original or sequels should return but I think it should be a less known character, like Vince Vaughn's from the Lost World. Could possibly even have one of the kids from the original return as a grownup.<br />  Well anyway, anybody that's into  Dinosaurs should love these films, it has every type you can think of.  Plus even if you're not you should still enjoy them, they're just flat out fun pop-corn movies.
B00002E285|3.0|the first time i heard THE WALL was from an LP.i was in my late 40's, not a rock fan but this music hooked me.so when i came across a laserdisc a few years later i purchased it.the disc was pan&scan(3:4) with an analog soundtrack.i watched it at least 20 times through the years enjoying it more each time.the disc then was issued with a digital soundtrack and in a widescreen format.i found the sound to be about the same but the widescreen format took away some of the life in the transfer.recently i purchased the dvd and found the latest sound transfer to be a major disappointment.it was lacking in the deep base of the laserdisc. the sound on all the added sections of the dvd were excellent.the widescreen picture was sharp but still lacked the life of the pan&scan.i have watched this film on a 25 and 32 TV as well as my 109 front projector LCD. also as was mentioned on the commentary of the DVD a subwolfer is a necessity to fully enjoy the soundtract.text refers to dvd and laserdisc
B00005NWM3|5.0|i would have to say that people of all ages would enjoy this cd. my mom is in her 50's and i catch her listening to this all the time..... my 6 year old son can sing every song on this album..... i think they are great.
B00005JKNB|5.0|I went into this movie not knowing *anything* about it.  I don't even think I knew Jim Carrey was in it.  I came out of it amazed!  Awesome movie that I ended up seeing twice in the theater.  It's not a heart-pounding, keep you glued to your seat type of movie, but more of a modern classic.  Don't take my word for it though, check it out for yourself.
B000067FP8|3.0|A lot of people hate Gremlins 2 but I always found it to be goofy and creative fun. It's not as original and good as the first eventhough some critics actually gave it better reviews than it. Possibly because they thought the first one was a little too dark for kids and this one is a lot more lighter even if it still does have violence. It's mostly just goofy violence though. It gets creative with it's type of Gremlins this time around too. Since their is a mad scientist played by Christopher Lee who's chemicals they get into. One turns into a half gremlin half spider, one turns electrical, one has a face with vegatables all over it and another gets wings and can now fly. That's all fun stuff but at least I think so since I know a lot of people that hate this movie.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I must say that I agree with reviewer Kethlenda that though it's a good movie, I don't think that anyone who hasn't read the books would understand it. I have read the first four books many, many times, and I plan to read the fifth book the day it's released in the U.S.. However, my older brother has not read the books, yet he watched the movie with me. He was constantly asking, &quot;What?&quot; and said at the end that he didn't understand about 3/4 of it (not his words exactly, but from what he told me, I'd say that I'm being generous when I state &quot;3/4&quot;). <BR>I also agree that the part about Hermione solving the potions part of the puzzle should not have been cut out. I was horribly distraught when I saw that they had cut that part out. For me, that was one of the coolest parts. I wanted to see how they would show the fires that appear at the doors. It wouldn't have been that hard. They could have used CG (computer graphics) for it, just like they'll probably have to do in book #4. <BR>Anyway, overall, good book; one of the more faithful movies that I've ever seen, but DEFINITELY not perfect.
0062502182|1.0|This book is a collection of recyled 'wisdom' told through <BR>a boring and hackneyed plot with a patronizing tone. We should all go green and put this one into the recycling bin.
B0000636UN|5.0|Its a great album!  It rocks and its fun without sounding like too much top 40 pop.  If you like Sheryl Crow buy the disc and enjoy!!
B00005QIPH|5.0|Just eleven songs long, this is perfectly to-the-point rock, with lots of great beats and loops. Lead singer's voice is rough, engaging and appropriate, like the music, which is mostly about being young and wanderlust. The instruments really take on their own character and are at times more engaging than even the lyrics. Often compared to Lou Reed and Velvet Underground, Stooges, Smiths, etc, because its hard to find a direct contemporary comparison, but toss influences of Cure,Brit pop,Guides by VOices alongside and the roots of their sound come about. But they aren't derivative. Their sound is unique in itself. Easily one of the best albums in contemporary music, probably destined to be written in the anums of music history, but for now, just worth paying fifteen bucks for and making it a part of your record collection.
B000062TU1|2.0|Being a big fan of Harry Potter books I really did not enjoy the movie.  There were several casting errors (Maggie Smith comes to mind) but the reason for the low review is this..<br />My 30ish sister rented the DVD to see the extra scenes.  After spending an hour an a half trying to figure out where they were on the DVD she asked me to try to figure it out.  After I couldn't do it (I'm the technowiz in our house) I went online to discover she had to play the game to view them.  Needless to say, after all the packaging and ads screaming &quot;deleted scenes&quot; she was very disappointed.  She was too burned out at this point to play the game so we returned it.
B000065U1N|5.0|A gripping, gritty portrayal of our elite fighting forces and the tragedy surrounding their operation against a brutal warlord in Somalia. These men fought bravely and hard, and although they did not receive the support from higher up that might have turned a long, bloody day into the planned shorter operation, they seemed to accept their fate and many were willing to go back in and rescue their comrades. This movie makes you proud to be an American and gives you new respect for our young warriors.<BR>See the movie, read the book by Mark Bowden, then see the movie again.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  My children have watched it about 20 times in the 3 days that we have owned it and I have watched it at least twice.  I had never read the Harry Potter series novels and had no idea what to expect from this movie, but I was not disappointed.  The movie is fast paced and I found it easy to follow.  This movie made me want to purchase the other Harry Potter novels and left me anxiously awaiting a sequel!<BR>I did watch the deleted scenes and out takes.  I didn't find it hard to get to them, but it was a little time consuming.<BR>Overall, I think that this was a very entertaining movie and good family entertainment!
B00005K3O0|5.0|One of the best films of the late 1970's. A spine-tingling tale about an eleven-year-old girl who has nightmares about a former existence when she died in a car fire .Susan Swift gives a touching performance as Ivy Templeton. Sir Anthony Hopkins , Marsha Mason and John Beck also star in this bittersweet and   horrifying film based on Frank De Felita's best-selling novel.Watch this one with the lights out.If you're skeptical about reincarnation it might just make a believer out of you yet.<BR>If you like this one I also recommend &quot;The Changeling&quot; (1979) staring George C. Scott and Trish Van Deer .
B00004YYDI|5.0|I've always enjoyed hitman films, but this one really got my attention. It feels as if Jean Reno is actually a hitman himself.  To anyone whose thinking about buying this film, think no further, BUY IT!!!  The Uncut International Version on DVD. This is one of the best movies of all time!
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is one of the best CD's EVER!  I'm not joking!  You have to get up and get yourself a copy!  If you don't, you're missing out on a great thing.  Here's individual track ratings:<br />'Losing Grip'-nice rock feel, nice lyrics<br />'Complicated'-first single, good message, good lyrics<br />'Sk8er Boy'-reminds me of someone I know, some-what dancable<br />'I'm With You'-nice feel, nice lyrics<br />'Mobile'-nice<br />'Unwanted'-nice angry feel<br />'Tomorrow'-one of my two ABSOLUTE FAVORITE songs on here!  I LOVE THIS SONG!<br />'Anything But Ordinary'-this song is one of my theme songs, like the lyrics.  Is it just me or is this song kind of like 'Soak Up the Sun'?<br />'Things I'll Never Say'-nice feel<br />'My World'-catchy beat<br />'Nobody's Fool'-I like the part where she just talks, doesn't sing, it just sounds cool.  Well, cool but weird.<br />'Too Much To Ask'-nice and slow<br />'Naked'-one of my two ABSOLUTE FAVORITE songs on here!  I LOVE THIS SONG!<br />GET THIS ALBUM!
B0000214F0|5.0|One of a kind, there will never be another movie made like this one.  Malcolm McDowell is a magnifacent Caligula that is going insane. Yes the movie has graphic sex, but this enhances the realization of the period and the power of one person during the early years of the roman empire. I have seen the NC-17 version, and it does not do it justice.  The only way to obtain the true realization of the period is through the unrated version. It is XXX. If it can be done, it is in this movie
6304466498|1.0|Spaceballs must be one of the stupidest movies ever made!  If I could give this movie 0 stars I would.  This movie was cheaply made and not at all funny.  Tacky and tasteless.  No storyline and the special effects were nauseating-literally.  Don't waste your money like I did.
B000002LFZ|3.0|Greatest hits albums are the devil.  Especially for band, like this one who don't really rely on singles.  Fleetwood Mac is a band that can sell 3 million albums without a hit single.  In the process, songs that weren't originally singles become their most popular songs (i.e. Landslide, Gold Dust Woman, The chain).  With that fact and greatest hits album becomes inappropriate for this band.  This album left me unfulfilled, yes it has two new tracks (which by the way are pretty good).  But what they left out just left to much to desire.  An example of what is appropriate for this band is, The Chain box set, which was realeased four years later in 1992 (someone please tell me why the only one you can get is the two cd version anymore, its really a shame).  This album just seems like an attempt to fill the void after Lindsey Buckingham's departure the previous year.  One big plus for the album is that it includes the full version of Sara, which is not available on the Tusk cd (who's decision it was to edit it should be fired).  My advice is don't by this particular album until you have their previous albums.  And even then, only if you're a die hard Mac fan.
B000060P79|5.0|simple plan plays some awesome music. pop-punk but tere still awesome and have some great catchy tunes!If you listen to rufio, new found glory any thing like that ypull love this cd!
B00005JKJA|4.0|Okay.  This movie was accurately described in the above reviews, but there's something left out.  This movie is disturbing.  The actors are protrayed like little dolls, some with exaggerated experssions, some with none at all.  The thing about this movie is that there's so much parallel action taking place, it's extremely confusing to sort the movie out in your head.  Sometimes things don't make much sense, such as the compeltely recorded orchestra (NO HAY ORQUESTRA, NO HAY BANDA!), and the little blue box that opens to reveal apparently nothing.  But after about an hour of thinking, I figured this movie out somewhat.  It's in backwards order.  The last 30 minutes of the movie are actually the first minutes chonologically.  If you put it into that perspective, the movie is a lot more understandable.  I gave it a 4 because it was brilliantly designed, but the movie is so irregularly arranged, it gets completely disturbing and almost too unbearable to watch.
B00006690F|5.0|I love this CD it is so personal, and if you listen to what the lyrics are saying, and you know a little about Eminem you will understand what I am talking about.  I just can't see how anyone could give this less than Five stars, they must not appricate or know music.
B00005RYL2|5.0|I first saw this movie when it came out.  The DVD has alot of extras, behind the scenes and blurbs about the actors.  For those who like action, scifi, romance, blood &amp; guts, this movie has it all.  Sean Connery lights up the screen and Christopher Lambert is just plain awesome.  I would recommend you get all the Highlander movies.
B00006690G|5.0|Here's my reasoning.  I can listen to and actually enjoy every single song on the CD.  Not many CDs meet that criteria and for that reason this is clearly a 5 out of 5 stars CD.
0887307396|1.0|I was unfortunate enough to have to read this book for a Plant Management training program.  I found this book to be inane and the conclusions drawn by the authors to be ridiculous and uninformed.  Further, the &quot;case studies&quot; presented in the book are incomplete and involve an obvious &quot;slant&quot; based on the personal opinions of the authors.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN OBTAINING ANY USEFUL INFORMATION.  This book should not rate even 1 star.
B000005IS1|5.0|8 live tracks, a Troggs cover, &quot;I Want You(Right Now)&quot;, that is almost a different song the way they do it, another cover is &quot;Motor City is Burning&quot; by bluesman John Lee Hooker which is a LITTLE more faithful to the original. The 5 also do some live versions of their own older material, and it all ends with &quot;Starship&quot;, a free jazz/NOISE piece that is heavily influenced by Sun Ra and has a touch of psychedelia. This is basically high energy heavy metal that draws on various unlikely influences, not all of them musical, and the &quot;early punk rock&quot; tag it gets seems justified. Half the time the rythm guitar is slightly out of tune and really seems to dominate the other intstruments in the mix. The feeling is very high energy, not unlike AC/DC or the thrash bands of the 80's might've sounded in the late 60's-if you can dig that. Could be the best album/tape/cd around.
B00006312Q|1.0|I must say that Celine is amazing and too many people make fun of her or say &quot;Oh I hate her music.&quot; They evidently haven't listined to her newest work. Well, that said, I would recommend you don't buy this single because you already have two versions on the original CD and the Christian B version is really no different. I was sorely disappointed because I thought I was leaving the store with a dance remix (after I heard it in a dance club in San Diego).Not the case - I guess we'll have to wait for this.
B00006690F|5.0|I listened to the album and I must say this is his best work yet.  All of his songs in this album come from his heart.   I am also sorry to anyone who was affended by Marshall's previouse albums, on second thought I'm not sorry.  His first couple of albums where made for people with a sense of humor.  Taking words from a rap song like (I'm gonna Kill you__track 2--Marshall Mathers LP) to the heart is truly your own stupidity.  Honestly do you think he actually does that, you have a brain use it.  Other than that this cd was incredible.  The song (Square Dance) was one that i liked the most.  This song told of his thoughts on war and going in at 18 years of age.  See Slim is not using his SENSE OF HUMOR in this cd very much, thought I'd clarify that for some one track minded people.
B00005R2M3|2.0|I was expecting something really great and original after hearing the hype about Shakira.  She is a middling singer at best and has only one good song on this album.  Most of the songs are simple retreads of better music.  She should have spent more time in the studio and with a singing coach.  But the album has good production values and good studio musicians.  Too bad the material is so weak.  This album will be forgotten in 5-7 years but &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; will probably be played on the radio for many, many years to come.
B000002B30|4.0|I'm no huge fan of Springsteen, but I have always respected him because he speaks for the common, everyday bloke.  He doesn't fall into the trappings of the &quot;typcial&quot; pop star creating &quot;manufactured&quot; music.  His songs have endured over the years because we can relate to them so well.  This collection is a fairly decent survey of his biggest chart hits; the cornerstone of this album seems to be the cuts from &quot;Born in the USA,&quot; which in itself is a greatest hits album.  Even though I am not a huge Springsteen fan, even less rabid fans will notice that this collection is incomplete.  I would have gladly dumped the 4 new songs and replaced them with the near-classic &quot;Rosalita,&quot; for instance.  Heck, even the b-side &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; would have been a more welcome addition.  Until the Boss releases a proper hits collection that covers his recording career more comprehensively, this album will do.
B00006690F|5.0|I bought this CD last weekend because I saw the interview Eminem had with Sway on MTV, which made me believe this CD wasn't just dissin' celebrities, because before I saw that interview, I thought that this CD would be 20 songs of material similar to \\"Without Me\\", which is a good song (not to be overdone though).  But this CD has great hip-hop music and the lyrics have a very important message.  He reaches out to his fans who feel like commiting suicide, have broken homes, having a ton of sex (and in return gettin STDs) and therefore he CONNECTS with kids.  He believes (and rightfully so) that parents and the law do not understand how well he does connect.  The song that might exhibit that best is White America, perhaps one of the most scathing songs I have heard about America's generic politicians and house wives doing everything they can to hide their kids from entertainment such as that of Eminem.  I feel that this is a very important album and it deserves to sell as well if not better than the Marshall Mathers LP.
0792101448|5.0|The more reviews you read on this movie the better sense that you'll get that it affects all of its fans the same way.  Conversely reviews can't adequately describe this movie at all.  For reasons that I don't think that I can adequately express this is my favorite movie.<br />Reviews have adequately captured the film's historical and realistic backdrop.  The main film musical theme as well as the character musical themes are superb and for this reason even if marginally distracting at some points are completely excusable.  I can't imagine how there could have been any better performances than those given by each of the main character actors.  They could never remake this movie.  I honestly think that although most of these actors have given fine performances in many other movies, that they gave their finest performances in this movie!  All of the dialog could easily have fit in a 30-minute film.  The only thing left to fill in the remaining 135 minutes was acting - and act they did.  To this day I can't see a movie with any of them in it when I don't think about \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\". <br />Sometimes the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  The feeling that you get when you watch this movie differentiates it from all others.  It's this feeling that makes me appreciate it every time I watch it.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is one of the best C.D.'s Ive ever listened to. I dont usually get over excited about the release of new bands, cause they're all the same nowadays...but this girl? Uh uh...she obviously different, just from the looks of her. And every single song on this album is fantastic. It portrays the views of millions of teens, but it also has a way of not making people all depressed about the way they feel. It's very self empowering, I suggest you take a listen!
0440219078|4.0|This book hooks you from the beginning and you don't want to put it down!  Every reader cheers for Jonas as he finds free will, yet your heart aches for his not being able to use it.  I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I thought the ending was severely lacking.  The conclusion came too close to the climax of the book.  I just like to KNOW the ending of a book without drawing a million conclusions out of imagination.  Still a must read book:)
B00003CXI1|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theaters and still do when I see it again on DVD. But.<br />There is still but about this DVD. I was eager to get this and was delighted to read that it would be on 2 DVDs. I thought that the first disc would have a magnificent picture with Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and DTS ES tracks. It was a disappointment that it didn't include a DTS track, even though there seem to be space for it, since there are no audio commentary or other special features on the first disc. The picture was good with vibrant colors and the sound track was good too, but it lacked that extra dynamic sound that SO many DVDs lack, that almost all newer laserdiscs had (even on movies in mono sound).<br />But I bought this movie mainly for the movie itself. The movie is magical in every way, with a virtually perfect cast. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry has just right amount of charm and charisma to make the character work on the big screen. Robbie Coltrane, Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith are just a few of the great English actors who star in this movie. I think this movie will endure for many years to come.<br />Now for the negative side, the special features disc. It is true what other reviewers have said that it is made like a kid's game. I wanted to see the documentaries about the different aspects of the book to film process, but all it contained (or at least what I have found) was a 15 minute documentary that reminds me of the bad 'behind the scenes' programs on E! or other entertainment TV stations, that are shown when the movie is in the theaters and don't really say much. The documentary did say some, but it was all in bits and pieces. There should just have been a link to a game version of the features for kids and a normal features menu for adults.<br />The movie, though, is worth the movie I paid for the entire release, but I don't think I'll be watching the features disc much at all.
B000002NJS|5.0|This Madonna album has got to be the best album to debut in 98. It Madge's best in years and it true keeps the heart and soul dancing till the end. She has truly had over 10 years of vocal training to achieve the sound. Maddie is the true survivor of the 80s and has completely ruled the Pop World ever since.
B000059PQQ|3.0|I was dying to see this film for years (being the cult film fan that I am), but when I did it really messed with my mind. It's a typically enoyable Terry Southern farce (although I like THE MAGICA CHRISTIAN more) with some symbolism that you may -or may not- want to read into ... <BR>The drugged out humor is quite dated but many of the jokes work well - Brando does a fabulous job as the guru and John Austin is a panic (as he always is). However the very ending will blow your mind and you'll have to think about it for a while.<BR>As a previous reviewer had said, \\"they don't make them like this anymore\\" is a trusim - then again I don't think they would allow them to make one like this anymore (or no one would have the guts to do so).<BR>If you like Southern's counter culture humor and cinematography like that of MYRA BRECKENRIDGE you may want to try some CANDY.<BR>Cheers!
0380789019|5.0|Once in a while whilst visiting your local library (or bookstore, or online shop, whichever you perfer) you reach the far corner shelf. One with missmached dusty books that you never heard of. Thats when I met this jewel. As soon as i finished reading it I wondered why in the world my friends hadn't already read it. It was a hit, a success, and inspiration. Welllll maybe thats taking it a bit far. But this is one of the better books I read.<BR>From start to finish it introduces a constant string of charecters, some you instantly hate (the bad guys) and some you grow to love. The book is so greatly detailed that you find yourself screaming &quot;get out of the way!&quot; or &quot;dont go in there!&quot; instantly to realise that yes, it is a book and no, they cant hear you. Then you blush and look around to see if anyone saw you. <BR>But it is a wonderful book, a great read, and an overall classic. I can only pray that Mr. Gaiman writes a sequel.
0140186395|4.0|John Steinbeck's East of Eden creates a dramatic story that keeps the readers on the edge of their seats waiting for what might happen next.  It talks of human nature in both extremes, good and evil.  These extremes are incorporated in his theme of good versus evil.  People aren't born as good or evil.  Rather, everyone has a choice to become better people or not.  This key theme of \\"choice\\" or \\"timshel\\" is carried throughout the book by Lee, the Chinese servant, and Cal, the manipulative child who matures through mistakes.  <br />The book is so vivid because John Steinbeck grew up in Salinas Valley.  This personal experience adds to the realistic settings he creates.  It makes the extremes of human nature more real.  The theme of good and evil explains our personal conflicting emotions.  In the end, like the characters, we learn that our choices determine our destiny.  East of Eden is a great book to learn about human nature and destiny with his realistic imagery.
B000003489|5.0|A lot hasbeen written about this important album, and I can't duplicate or improve on much of it. It was one of the first examples of what a gifted composer Trane was, and not just a sax monster, etc... What I will remark now, after several listens, is to set aside the historical importance of this recording - that this music can be placed next to today's music and sounds even fresher and cleverer than when placed into the context of Trane's ouvre. Try it.<br />You can also use this album to discourage young musicians from taking up the tenor saxophone, so be careful.<br />We only got one John Coltrane, and we'll never have another one.
630575067X|4.0|Face it, you either love EP 1 or you hate it.  I happen to like it mainly because the lightsaber battle scenes are phenomenal and you get insight as to how the series began and you can start to see how all this fits into the original 1970's-era Star Wars trilogy.  Meeting R2D2, C3PO and Anakin AND KNOWING what will eventually become of them is somewhat fascinating.  Granted, the addition of Jar Jar was added for comic relief, but he is annoying and a large part of what made Episode I so bad in many viewer's opinions.  If you look past that, the rest of the film is excellent and if you recall, Return of the Jedi had a similar childish theme when the Ewoks were introduced and they were just as annoying.<br />The film is pretty good as far as VHS is concerned.  The mastering process was done well and the packaging matches the newly released Star Wars Trilogy (Episodes 4, 5 and 6) so you can put them on your movie collection shelf and have a consistent look.  Not much in the way of extras (none actually) but that's what the DVD version is for.
0440219078|2.0|A review by Kaytee<br />The Giver is a novel set in black and white talking about the color of emotions. This book is focused on telling the world how there should be no hate, no crime, no hurt or pain. It also describes everyone being happy and living a cheerful life, as we all know, that's not how it is in this world unfortunately. A young man given the name Jonas was given the chance to become the quote on quote \\"Receiver of memories.\\" As he turns 12 years old he's known as The Giver. He sees everything in a good way but realizes how much of a difference there is in the world. <br />I didn't enjoy reading \\"The Giver\\" at all. The beginning of this book was so boring, and didn't catch my attention one bit. But as a read on and on I would get more into it. But soon enough it would lose my attention again. The beginning was a little bit strange at some parts. Towards the middle I enjoyed a lot! I think it is because that's where all the action is, and the ending, well, let's just say the author really lost me there! I think this book deserves two starts because it's that kind of book that can catch your attention at some points but others you just feel as if you don't want to read it anymore. Hopefully next time we choose a book to read I'll know its one I actually have an interest in. <br />I strongly do not recommend this book to a young adult. I think this book should before mature audiences because he talks about injections as well as his love for a lady. I don't think that should be allowed for a 9 or 10 year old.
B00004XPP0|4.0|What more is there to say about the SW trilogy?  The packaging is well done (and matches the Episode I packaging) and the overall film quality is quite good.  Each film has been re-mastered and these are the &quot;Special Edition&quot; releases that were brought back to the theaters in 1997 with the added scenes and CGI.  I also like the fact that Episode IV's (a new hope) packaging describes the fact that this episode takes place 30 years after the Phantom Menace...nice touch.  What was cool was that you got a brief sneak peek at Ep II (which has since been released) at the beginning of a New Hope.<br />Out of all the films, I'd say Episode VI-Return of the Jedi is the weakest.  This is a must-have until the original trilogy is re-released on DVD (which George Lucas has been heard saying won't happen until AFTER Episode III is released...and that will be at LEAST 4-5 years since filming won't even start until June 2003!).
0792165020|5.0|This is the best movie ever!  It doesn't get better than this!  Watch out if you don't like bloooooooooooooood!
B00005QZWI|5.0|This soundtrack is enchanting.  I am not a huge soundtrack fan, but knew that when I saw this movie I had to purchase this cd, and I was not dissapointed.  The Prophecy is dark and mysterious, a great opener.  Gollum's theme is simply haunting!  Concerning Hobbits is clever and the playful style depicts the Shire perfectly.  A Knife in the Dark is as the title says, dark and spooky.  A highly underated track is Flight to the Ford, which is my personal favorite.  From Arwen's Theme to the absolutely beautiful opening music to the frightening Nazgul chorus, it is sweeping and epic.  It sends shivers up my spine!  Many Meetings provides the much needed hopeful break in the midst of an ever-darkening soundtrack.  Aniron is gorgeous, and Enya's contribution to this cd is very organic, quite fitting.  The Ring Goes South is a great intro to the journey ahead, and Lothlorien is mysterious, as is Elizabeth Frasier's voice befitting in Lament for Gandalf.  The Breaking of the Fellowship is also another great track, and May it Be ends the album on a faithful note.  A must have for any soundtrack fans.  I especially love the way Shore dispersed choral passages throughout this soundtrack.  It adds that historical touch, and enhances the music.
B00003CXI1|3.0|This is the tail of two DVD discs; one gets 5 stars and the other gets 0 stars.  If I could give a 2.5 star rating I would. <br />First let me start off with the good things...the film itself.  This was one of the best adaptations of novel that I have seen (the best being The Green Mile).  I thought that the characters came to life and that the images and effects were wonderful.  It really transports the viewer to Hogwarts.  The DVD captures the film beautifully and I thought the picture quality was very good.<br />Now on the other hand, disk 2, the Extras.  Well, I guess they would be great if you could figure out how to see them.  I read that it is like a game where you are a student at Hogwarts and need to get all of the things for school prior to going and exploring the grounds to find the deleted scenes.  Well, if you are an adult have fun because it is near impossible to figure out.  I guess it would be fun for the children and I guess I should face the fact that this movie and DVD was intended for children.  <br />All in all Great Movie, and DVD, just not such great extras.  I would buy this DVD if you liked the movie and have some time to spend to try and figure out the Extras!
B0000640RX|5.0|Wow, it's been a while, but rewatching these classic '80s action movies on DVD has been a real trip!  \\"First Blood\\" was a gripping novel that inspired an excellent movie, and to date it remains my favorite of the three because it has the most unconventional take on the \\"action hero\\"... who's just another poor, damaged, and misunderstood soul left over from the wake of Vietnam; his actions may be questionable, but we sympathize with his plight because the writing coupled with Stallone's perfect performance allow us to believe that he truly has been wronged.  \\"Rambo: First Blood Part II\\" is the quintessential action movie of the '80s; its character arcs aren't as compelling as in \\"First Blood,\\" but it's an entertaining movie through-and-through and manages to retain some depth by exploring the issue of forgotten MIA vets still in Vietnam.  \\"Rambo III\\" has a very clever take on the real-life US intervention in Afghanistan against the Soviets during the Regan era, but has the least depth of the three movies because ultimately it's more about Rambo rescuing his friend and mentor (a well-portrayed-as-always-by-Richard Crenna), Sam Trautman, as an excuse to create 2 hours' worth of nonetheless exhilarating action scenes.  All of this is wholeheartedly complimented by Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful score; his Rambo theme transitions wonderfully from hard-driving action to passionate ballad and resonates in your mind after each film is over!  Stallone is a smart screenwriter and actor, and he knows what makes these movies work, which I think is well-evidenced by their enduring popularity now in 2002.  This excellent DVD package has it all, and is definitely the perfect experience for anyone wishing to relive the fun and excitement that made the action movies of the '80s so great!  Particularly these action movies, which have a true and recognizable main character (not just an actor blowing things up), which I think truly sets them apart from the pack.  Watch and enjoy!!
6302098440|4.0|Robert Wagner stars as a young Scandian prince in exile whose quest to win back his father's throne leads him to King Arthur's court and the arms of beautiful Princess Aleta in this extremely well-made and enchanting 1954 adaptation of the famous comic strip character.  A delightful mix of adventure, comedy, romance, and royal intrigue, Prince Valiant is brought to life by a marvelous cast (Wagner as the titular young knight; Janet Leigh as his lady Aleta; James Mason as the traitorous Black Knight; and Sterling Hayden as Val's mentor, Sir Gawain) from a heady script by Dudley Nichols and the exhuberant direction of Henry Hathaway.  Non-stop fun right up to the amazing trial by combat at the end (one of the best sword fights ever filmed), Prince Valiant is a first class family film that everyone can enjoy.
B000066JES|5.0|Warriors of the World is my first Manowar album, so I can't really look back at the other releases. <BR>I reallt enjoyed the musical skill in the music, it creates a great athmosphere! I really like the way these guys play. The lyrics are good but the words \\"Fight\\" and \\"Die\\" get repeated all over again. Still every song has it's own style and is enjoyable. <BR>This is really good release!
B00003CXI0|5.0|Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone is one of the best movies I,ve seen in years.<br />This movie unlike most in recent years almost pulled almost every image from my deepest imaginations. HPATSS is a movie of pure magic.<br />The story tells of a young boy whose parents were killed by an evil wizard and that Harry would become an admired magician. He wouldn't know anything about his parents until he was 11.<br />The school in the movie with the awesome special effects and magic wands makes me wish that school in real life was like that. Many school would've been so much more interesting than it is in real life.<br />The movie would retain the top spot as the number one movie only briefly before the Earth-shattering masterpiece Lord Of The Rings overtook it.<br />Harry Potter is a movie for all ages to enjoy. Even my 83 year old grandmother loved it. Guess it shows that this movie was made for all ages although it might spook the very young.<br />I,m not going to tell everything about this movie. You just have to go and see for yourself.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I own the dvd.. how come i can't tell without doing something to you. I don't see resident evil (the movie) getting so much praise as the video game which came before it got. Yeah, sure it was nice enough, but nice doesn't really cut it when it comes down to this genre of film. <br />Mila Jovovich (fifth element) gives an outstanding acting performance and the Dark Angel chick wasn't half bad either. Yet they failed to really make the movie. The special effects, the setting and the plot were highly unoriginal and the makers should have deviated more from the game story line to make this movie into what it could have been.<br />If you want to see what I mean with \\"could have been\\" watch Jeepers Creepers or Blade II and you'll see what I mean. A cocktail of gore, suspense, credibilty and high tech cinematography....<br />That's what I expected and did not get.. therefore.. yet still entertaining..
6304712936|5.0|This movie--words don't describe the beauty and the amazing life of a brilliant composer: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The first time I watched this movie, on DVD actually, I put the CD on the wrong side. I was impressed at how great the movie was even though I only watched 45 minutes of it and understood nothing of what was going on. After I watched the wrong side of the DVD, I played the right side and was mesmorized by the acting and how impressive Mozart's life was. His laugh was the best part throughout the entire movie. I told my parents that they should watch it and my mother loved it. The backdrop was made to be so real, that if someone had never experienced that era in history, it would have been like they had been there all of their life. I am running out of things to say, but never before had I given a thought to the hardships people faced before my time and many others. The awards this movie won were well-deserved and should, in my view, have brought home more. Only one complaint for the whole thing: I really didn't like the beginning, and how graphic the director was. That is the only draw-back (if you have a quesy stomach, skip the very beginning). Everything else was masterfully done!
B000002540|5.0|This is very possibly the best live album ever produced by any band ever!! To say it merely rocks is a massive - almost insulting - understatement. This album shifts tectonic plates somewhere deep beneath sea level. Whilst other live albums including BOC's own ETL may have cleaner, sharper production none has the raw, live energy this one has. This is probably as close as you'll come to actually being there. I'll start as they do with The Subhuman - oh wow excuse me while I babble incoherently for several hours - where to begin? This song was already one of my favourites from Secret Treaties but this version blows that one out of the water on so many levels. This is how the song is meant to be heard. There is a guitar solo to bring you stamping and whooping to your feet and tears of wonder to your eyes and begs the question is Donald Roeser the most underestimated guitarist in rock history? This is followed by a kick [rear] version of perennial favourite Harvester of Eyes. No let up either when they follow up with an exuberant and enthusiastic performance of Hot Rails to Hell or the pure adrenalin rush that is the Red and the Black. This version of 7  Screamin' Dizbusters  is enough to make grown men beg for mercy - the pace is relentless. Buck's Boogie once again showcases  Roeser's formidable talents. Last Days of May what can I say -  there's an intensity here that's almost painful to the listener. Cities on Flame, ME262  and Redcap - their own material is so strong  here that the competent if not outstanding cover of Maserati GT seems to be almost unnecessary although  Born to be Wild is not a bad version. This is heavy, heavy metal in fact if it were any heavier it would make your ears bleed.
0380789035|4.0|American Gods is the story of an ex-con with the single name of Shadow who is reluctantly recruited to participate in a war of the gods.  The ancient gods are fading as they are being forgotten, and new gods, representing television, computers and other modern objects of worship, are coming into power.<br />Gaiman, more well-known for his critically acclaimed comic book writing does a good job here.  At times the story does drag a little and at other times he is a little unclear, but overall, he has written a good novel.<br />The obvious influence for this novel seemed to be Harlan Ellison's Deathbird Stories (with its tales of the gods of modern life), and I was pleased to see Gaiman acknowledge this influence in the afterword.  In style, however, this book is more reminiscent of Clive Barker at his peak.  As dark fantasy, this is a good work, and although there is some room for improvement, I'd be willing to read more by Gaiman.
B00005OAIE|5.0|There is music for every instance in a person's life. Everyone has their favorite CD to put on when in a party, pissy, or content mood. Room For Squares touches all of these emotions for me. I discovered John Mayer on the radio from his single &quot;No Such Thing&quot; and I liked it so I went online to look up some of his other songs. I heard an accoustic recording of &quot;Why Georiga&quot; and in 5 seconds I had keys and purse in hand and was on the way to Best Buy to purchase the CD. Mayer's soulful voice and intricate guitar playing is like no other. The songs have a unique blusy sound to them that is soothing to the ear and mind. Another noteable about Mayer are his lyrics. They are insightful and more than words that ryme. This is not something that can be commented about every artist who is popular at this time. Sure, the music might be good, but sometimes when you really listen to what the person is singing it either doesn't make sense or is not interesting. So when listening to Room For Squares it is great for background music or to sit down and enjoy the lyrics as well. I highly recommend this CD to anyone. Even if this review doesn't describe the music that you normally listen to, give it a chance because the songs have a potental to reach a large listening group of people.
630027120X|5.0|From the opening scene to the breath-holding finale, this film is best compared to a awe inspiring work of art.  The story is simple: man struggles with man, man struggles with himelf, man struggles with \\"God\\".  The morality of the movie is somewhat lost in the visually appealing location that the movie was filmed in.  Several times I had to remind myself to take a breath.  The movie, along with the soundtrack, are easily one of the best pieces of art Hollywood has every released.  For those wanting romance, adventure, drama, or an assault on the senses; The Mission will deliver.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie in short is brilliant.<BR>Im sure a hundred other people have given their synopsis of this movie. Im just here to add my name to the extremely long list of people who only have praise for this movie.<BR>I loved the story, the atmosphere, the setting, and most of all the characters. <br />The worst thing about the movie is that it ends.<BR>:(
B00004U8H4|3.0|I have seen better, I was hoping it would be more exciting. It just had a guy that was so vain, it made the movie pathetic.
6304493681|5.0|Ghost in a shell is a classic anime which is worthy of every anime fan's dvd collection. Along with Akira, and the Ninja Scroll, this anime boasts incredible animation, atmosphere and creativity. Ghost in a shell also has a very crisp and clear sound track and digital effects.<br />GS is quite an interesting movie, which is actually quite hard to describe plotwise without going two pages long :)<br />Its basically the matrix of anime, which has probably been said enough times to be a cliche.<br />Anyhow, be sure to catch this one, it'll be worth youre 90minutes<br />:)
0679731725|5.0|Who would think that a story about a stodgy British butler could be a great read? But, this is exactly what \\"Remains of the Day\\" is. The book has a remarkable, quiet intensity<BR>     You can find details of the story in the other reviews. I will say that the serious reader will find many important themes in \\"Remains\\"; self-deception, love, history, racism, family, politics, and war. The story has two of the most intense scenes I've ever read, each having to do with Steven's persuit to be the very best butler he can be.<BR>     \\"Remains of the Day\\" is my favorite story of all time. The book is much better than the movie, but you can't go wrong with anything starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson! But, by all means, READ THIS BOOK!
B000000WJZ|5.0|i Dont think ill ever grow out of this cd. Each song is an absolute classic. Its the type of album you can listen to no matter what mood you're in, and really, there arent enough ways or words to praise this creation.<BR>Billy Corgan rocks the house in every respect, and i think this is the pumpkins greatest cd.<br />Buy all the others as well because theyre also good.<BR>But start with this one if you're new<BR>:)
6302994063|4.0|This is actually my favourite of Baz Luhrman's films, closely followed by Moulin Rouge and miles ahead of Romeo and Juliet.  The story is simple and predictable, but that only adds to its charm, rather than detracting from it.  The joy of this film comes from all the little moments, like Scott and Fran's father dancing beside the railway track, or flashback's to Scott's parents careers.  The sets and costumes are great, and in many ways this film is a kind of prequel, or companion piece to Moulin Rouge.  The performers are for the most part dancers before they are actors, but they are all perfectly competant.  The dance numbers really make the movie with wonderful music, slow motion, and slightly less frenetic editing than Luhrman's other movies.  The great, funny, romantic, sweet movie, to enjoy time and again.
0345440900|5.0|I read this book along with Brian Symon's book 'Silent Nights' and they both work. They did for me anyway. Both books are easy reads although have different strengths - I think they both compliment one another and make mothering an easier thing - well it did for an older mother like myself without a plethora of support around.<br />I really like Tracy's 'Easy' system, not just for the baby but also for my partner who was having difficulty figuring out what to do next. It was easy to explain and he didnt' have to read the book (which he flatly refuses to do). <br />Tracy has a whole section of analysing babies crys which is kind of useful - apparently all cries are the same world over no matter how individual we think our babies are. But in the end once you have a happy baby in a sort of routine then the cries don't usually matter as you seem to be able to predict what a baby needs pretty easily. She also helps to analyse what sort of baby you have and the best way of treating them to give them the best in life.<br />I like the confidence she gives to mothers in dealing with the babies needs and I also like the fact that this is a short relatively straightforward book.<br />If thereis one thing I dislike in all self help books it is the 'real life problem solved' stories. No matter how good Tracy is I got a bit sick of hearing how she solved everyone's problems - I know the book would be no good if she didn't and so that isn't really fair comment, its just a dislike I have for those sort of stories I guess.<br />Even though Hogg is the 'author of the moment it is a worthwhile read. If you are having problems with your baby, not having proper sleep, your baby is crying alot and you don't know why, or you know someone about to have a baby I would reccommend this book. I would also recommend you read the book by Symon as well though.
0800103661|4.0|A great, understated, low-key film that is intelligent and philosophical.  The filming is beautiful, austere without being cold, and nicely uncluttered.  Ethan Hawke turns in a nice performance as a normal man battling his natural genes and the society that rejects him because of them.  He has an easy chemistry with both his co-stars, Uma Thurman, who is perfectly believable and looks convincingly like a genetically engineered human, and Jude Law, turning in an effectively heart-breaking performance, and a spoilt, genetically perfect man, who nonetheless cannot live up to his potential.
B000002AGB|4.0|The Who worked and worked and worked to make themselves the best live band on earth, and it paid off to such an extent that a die-hard Beatles fan such as myself became a full-bore convert to Townshend and the powerhouse that was, in Roger Daltrey's words, \\"that bloody awful Who.\\"<br />There are striking similarities between the Isle of Wight show and LIVE AT LEEDS--they were recorded within just a few months of each other, after all--but these are different shows. I prefer the sound of LIVE AT LEEDS--the echo is warmer--but that is nitpicking. They are both great live LPs in their own right, and owning both is the way to go.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Just face it, Britney Spears is unstoppable, the most successful female artist of all time, fastest selling female artist of all time and winner of endless amounts of music awards- You must admit Britney must be doing something right!!<BR>This album definately proves to people that she is here to stay and expressing to the world that she is not a little girl anymore. Right from the start of this album you sense a great amount of growth from the song \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" which was produced by The Neptunes with its infectious and addictive  dance beats. The song shows a more R'n'B/Hip hop side to Britney's music which we haven't heard before in her last two smash hit albums. \\"Boys\\" follows the same kind of vibe and is another irrestiable dance-floor filler! But although Britney has changed her music direction more into R'n'B and Hip Hop those Pop Classic Britney songs are back with Max Martin writing a few of the songs just like \\"Overprotected\\", \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Bombastic Love\\". Britney even gets involved in the writing credits also by co-writing 5 songs including the amazing \\"I won't take your ... attitude song\\"~\\"Lonely\\" which expresses a very moody and angry sounding Britney which we have not heard before!<BR>This album is without a doubt a Classic and surpasses anything Britney has done before!<BR>I would recommend that everyone jump in and come for this ride with Britney because she is going to be here a very long time to come!<BR>********U gotta Buy this!!!**********
6305907145|1.0|This movie left me with a bad taste and upset me. The personalities of the characters in the book are unacceptably altered in the movie, and an important one, William Price, is left out.  Sir Thomas, who is a misguided, but kind man, is turned into an odious, cruel, hard monster.This movie is not for those who love Austen's novel. In fact, it should not have been called Mansfield Park. It has little in common with the novel.<br />If it had a different name, and was not advertised as &quot;based on a novel by Austen,&quot; it would not have been seen by people who are fans of Austen, which would have made the makers of it lose money. Oh, what they do in order to attract a larger audience!<br />Too bad that there is no option to give 0 stars.
B000063UR2|5.0|Alas, the art of creating great film villains is a dying one.  Hollywood villains these days are little more than maladjusted amphetamine abusers with a \\"kill me by the end of the third act\\" sign pasted to their arse. It's getting so I can't recall a big screen baddie who I actually ROOTED for.  Okay, there was Jack as the Joker in Batman.  And sure, I did shed a tear when Dafoe's Green Goblin got waxed by that effete webslinger.  None, however, compare to Tim Curry as DARKNESS.  Evil characters should be sensual, powerful, arrogant, beautiful, intelligent, violent, and above all, have a great smile.  In short, the film villain should make the viewer wish - if only for a little while - that they could be a villain as well. So . . . do you want to WANT to be bad??? Get your dose of Darkness.
B000002JS8|5.0|one of AC/DC's best albums. I think Bonn Scout has an awsome voice.
B00003CXI1|4.0|The movie adaptation of JK Rowling's wonderful Harry Potter books was wonderful.  Yes, there were some deleted scenes, but overall, their absence did not detract from the plot.  Books will always be better than their movie adaptations, regardless of who wrote them.  I have yet to see a 100% true adaptation that was entertaining.<br />One of my favorite parts of owning a DVD player is seeing the deleted scenes.  In order to get the scenes for the Sorcerer's stone, though, you had to go through a series of &quot;visits&quot; to Diagon Alley, Hogwarts grounds, &amp; classrooms.  While, theoretically, this would be fun, in reality, it was way too much to go through in order to get a paltry extra 10 minutes of footage.<br />It was a worthwhile buy, though, and I'll watch &amp; rewatch it for years to come.
630469878X|5.0|Thelma & Louise is one of those unfortunately all too rare movie gems which really engages the viewer. Watch it with a good friend and you'll find yourselves energised by the zest for life displayed by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon in their stand out performances. Like Thelma and Louise, you'll want to ditch your jobs for the weekend and beg, borrow or steal a classic convertible car, before setting off on a road trip adventure along the USA's dusty mid-western highways.<br />The premise of the film is simple - put two ordinary people in an extraordinary situation and watch what happens as events start to snowball. Davis's bored housewife and Sarandon's diner-waitress are typical of thousands of women the world over. A chance encounter on the way to a run-of-the-mill weekend holiday in the mountains starts a chain of happenstance that thrusts the two friends into a situation where there are no signposts and no rules. <br />Thelma & Louise is often classified as a 'chick flick', but this is perhaps somewhat misleading. Certainly it is true that this is a film about two women, and the men in the story are shown as ineffectual or lacking in understanding (although watch for an entertaining appearance by Brad Pitt in what is regarded as his breakthrough role). However one of the main themes dealt with is the emotive and perennially grey area surrounding attempted rape and how the reporting of it is dealt with - this is clearly not the fluff and insubstantiality usually associated with chick flicks. Despite this and despite the outcome of the film (which on one level could be viewed as tragic), the brilliant and insightful cinematography of Ridley Scott leaves the viewer upbeat and with a tremendous sense of freedom.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Wonderfully done movie for all ages and the cast is well put together!  We recently bought this movie and really enjoyed it.  Not much to say about the second disc though as it didn't live up to our expectations.  Not only is it slow to manuver through but the interviews were short and rather dull.  Definetly look for the deleted scenes on the second disc though as they are worth finding.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is a hot new sensation. She is a talented vocalist with a sassy attitude. Miss Lavigne is my new idol. Her music is great to listen to. I admire how she just loves music and plays it from the heart; its true. (She doesn't really know the technical way to play the guitar, avril taught herself) She has what it takes- individuality. JUST DON'T TURN INTO A TEENYBOPPER!! ahhh
B00005JKBC|4.0|I recently viewed the new Robert Redford movie \\"Spy Game\\", and really enjoyed the experience. As someone who worked within the federal bureaucracy for decades, I can readily verify that those aspects depicting the inner workings of the Central Intelligence Agency are certainly accurate and on point in this new film with Robert Redford and Brad Pitt.  Pitt plays an agent who possibly has gone rogue, and who has been taken prisoner by the Chinese. Redford plays his former handler, now re-engaged to decipher Pitt's action on the day of his own retirement, who smells something foul in the skunk works at the last moment of his own incumbency, and starts playing double-dare internal spy games with other CIA officers within the facility who seem to have some hidden ulterior motive for wanting to throw Pitt's character to the wolves.<br />Of course, one does well to recognize Redford's masterful hand in all this activity, since he has a well-earned reputation for questioning the nature of our intelligence agencies, their inbred culture of gamesmanship, and the way they work. Like spy thriller author John LeCarre (The Constant Gardener), Redford seems most interested in exploring the darker side of the so-called invisible government and its corrosive effect on the character of the men who populate it, and in the first hour or so, the film builds the tension between someone who wants to do right thing by an agent in the field and an agency looking to protect its own political agendas. As a result, Redford starts going out onto that precarious limb he had long ago advised Pitt never to venture onto, and learns some things about himself in the process.<br />The truth is revealed in layers of deceit and games, and one has to keep his wits about him in understanding why Redford takes some of the actions he does and what the agency is doing in the meantime. Yet at the conclusion all is clear, and the standoff ends with Redford driving his older Porsche off into the sunset of his own career and a much different future than he had imagined just a day or so before. Pitt plays his own part quite well as an iconoclastic recruit who learns enough about himself and the spy-game to understand there has to be a better and more purposeful way to live. This for me is the real strength of the movie, and the understated message Redford wants us to get; Our intelligence agencies work in service to goals often so twisted and altered from their original purpose as to be preposterous monsters, yet such conduct is all too common within the framework of how they operate. This is a cautionary tale told with purpose; to convince us the game is out of control.s own career and a much different future than he had imagined just a day or so before.

B000065VB0|5.0|You may ask yourself, \\"What have these songs in a minor key have to do with me?\\" Plenty. Often compared to Bowie's trilogy of albums, PG 1, 2 & 3 are all unique in their own way. PG 3 (which is compared to Bowie's Scary Monsters. No comparison really Gabriel wins hands down)stands as Gabriel's darkest, most compelling masterpiece.<br />Melt has often been acclaimed for its production and arrangements. At the heart of any PG album is the song. PG rarely was as focused as he is here. The lyrics occasionally drift into the preachy, trite arena but not often: Gabriel manages to dissect why assasins kill; take aim at social injustice; investigate the peeping tom in all of us. There's never a dull moment and the lyrics are often thoughtful and powerful.<br />The music matters on PG3 as well. While not as diverse as So or even Security, the monochromatic sound of PG3 works well at brining out the contrasts that fuel life. The cover black and white photography perfectly captures the mood of the album.<br />Enough hyperbole. The sound quality is outstanding and, aside from Security, shows the most improvement of all the PG albums re-released. The packaging for the limited edition consist of the original lyrics and rare photos from the tour to support PG3. What's missing? There's no bonus tracks or liner notes just the original credits at the very back of the booklet. It would have been interesting to hear the work-in-progress tapes for the album and live performances recorded during the tour. The only reason I can surmise as to why the re-released albums don't have bonus tracks is a potential boxed set on the horizon (it would tie in well with the re-releases and Gabriel's Up which is going to be released later--finally--in 2002).<br />The highlight of the PG trilogy, Melt focuses on both the seamy and the profound and finds that there's common ground between both.
B00005A46T|1.0|Blah blah blah, way to tone down your songs for the radio.  Way to release the same album about 6 times with slight changes so hardcore fans have to buy each.  Way to have some of the most pathetic lyrics in the world.  Listen to some Killswitch Engage and the new Soilwork is you want real metal
B00005MP58|4.0|The film itself is utter perfection.  It gets better every time I watch it!  However, I have to give this DVD only 4 stars because the quality leaves something to be desired.  I don't mind the widescreen transition; it's the color of the film that bothers me.  A former owner of the 6-tape collection, I know how the colors of this movie are intended to look, rich and fall-like, and to accomodate this new DVD I have to turn my contrast way down so as to not be blinded by the washed-out whiteness of the movie!  I don't know why they would mess with colors, and that's my only qualm with this DVD.
B000066NW0|5.0|When I heard the first single \\"complicated\\" from her album \\"let go\\" I was completley blown away by her deeply fullfilled voice.<BR>In my openion she is way better than michelle branch and all those other teen singers in terms of vocals and actaul talent.<BR>This cd has some really good songs like \\"Im with you\\" and \\"Things i''ll never say\\" along with some others.All you pop and alternative fans should defenitly pick this one up as soon as possible!
B00003CXI1|4.0|The movie is not nearly as good as the book.  What else is new.  I just don't understand how they could do the movie without Peeves.  That really is too much.  Aside from the terrible CGI I really enjoyed the Movie.  The DVD is another matter.  It is only worth it if you get the Widescreen version.  Other that the deleted scenes with are very hard to find, there is little else to enjoy more that one time.  I am ready for the new book, but it doesn't appear that we will get that anytime soon.  So enjoy the Movie.
0515123447|4.0|Lee Child displayed his natural talent on his first book. He has a straightforward, masculine manner which is reflected in the protagonist's personality and his often scornful view of the other characters. From the first page, he dives into the plot when Jack Reacher, the good guy, gets arrested for murder when he stops for coffee in a strange, small town.<br />Without giving too much away, there's a lot of detailed action scenes and Child, who was a tv writer, sure researched forensic science for the investigations and theories are thoroughly explained. Child favors action over sex in a book because when it comes to love scenes, we have to settle for one sentence summaries. Maybe Reacher who is tough, seasoned, and practical wouldn't waste time reciting the bed's ventures when he could be out coaxing strategies to catch his enemies. I even learned things about currency, analyzing crime scenes and scenarios.<br />I was quite drawn by the events and was happy to be stringed along. I was let down by the brash conclusion and Reacher's reaction to it but this book is a thriller and a thriller's #1 rule is: People are drawn to thrillers for the build up while attempting to analyze and solve the puzzle themselves and when they do solve it, it's just a picture of a silly bird, plane, or whatever. The outcome is not the point, we just like being toyed with. I still think the ending could have been better though.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I always enjoy David Lynch movies because they are so twisted.  That puts this one right up there.  I thought it was a little easier to follow than Lost Highway, but it was still twisted enough to really enjoy the way your brain feels like jelly when it is over.  I heard this was originally planned as a t.v. series.  I wish it would have been done that way.  A friend told me that the box was the key to how the series would have worked (turn the key and everything changes), but I don't know for sure.  Anyhow, if you enjoy David Lynch, then this is a must see.
B00005JY1B|5.0|I have to admit that I was initially attracted to this movie because of the Enya music--there is no more romantic music to listen to when you are in love or to make love to than Enya's music.  James Cameron realized that and tried to get Enya to write songs for \\"Titanic\\"--but it turned out that she did not have time to do so.  <br />Regardless, this movie is a definite top rate, excellent chick-flick tear-jerker if there ever was one.  Of course, what better city in which to set a romantic movie than San Francisco, which is where this movie occurs.  Sara Deever, a quirky 90's style woman chases after Nelson Moss, a hard driven ad designer.   After she sends him a cute little dog, he immediately returns the dog to her and, as she is cleaning up his left hand (that he had cut earlier in the day), he tells her about his day:  \\"I got fired.  They took the company car.  And my GIRLFRIEND left me\\"  \\"Perfect!\\", she says.  \\"Define 'perfect'\\", he says angrily. Perfect in this case is the lead in to the rest of the movie, a series of romantic crises, wonderful love scenes, ultimately leading to a two boxes of Kleenex ending.  This is my number 9 chick flick of all time (see my list of all time chick flicks).  And if you end up liking this movie, you will love the soundtrack!!!
B00006690G|5.0|Once again eminem has managed to out-do himself. This cd simply proves how much of a genius eminem is. He is amazing at what he does, and is one of the best rappers of all time. Everyone should should own this cd...whether you're black, white, a fan of hip-hop, or not....this is an album that will remain in the limelight for years to come. Keep up the good work Em!!
B00003CX5P|2.0|This movie was [poor], big disapointment from the other 4. The DVD seems to be good though, I don't know, haven't seen on dvd! I don't plan too, because this movie blowed!! Looked like your in a game, and Mr. Lucas even admitted himself that this movie was made for the children!! Too bad, I think it was Jar Jar who ruined this movie, for the most part, it's too bad!! Hopefully the 3rd will be more like the 2nd one than the 1st, cause this one wasn't good at all! Especially all those dumb looking aircrafts, looked like they were made of really cheap wood or metal. Dumb movie, the rest of STar Wars is great so, skip this one and watch the rest!!!
031286504X|5.0|I have always been a huge vampire fan, and I think this is my favorite vampire story of all time.  The pace is quick, and you are thrust into the story from page one.  There is a lot of intelligent speculation on the part of the character as far as his situation of being the last human left in a world of vampires.  This is appropiate though, as he is the only character in the story, and the book still has a very fast pase that can leave you wanting more at the end.  This story has some elements of &quot;Aliens&quot; and &quot;The Stand,&quot; and if you liked those and like vampires you will enjoy this story.
B00004XPP0|1.0|I am a huge Star Wars fan, but I can't understand why George Lucas refuses to release the original trilogy on DVD. It's difficult to find a widescreen VHS copy of the original trilogy, so I picked up the pan-and-scan version. I'm not picky; I just want the original Star Wars trilogy in widescreen, with restored and remastered picture and sound.<br /><br />Lucasfilm created an awesome DVD for Episode I, so why do we have to wait until 2005 for the original trilogy? George Lucas, you're an awesome filmmaker, but you have to realize that DVD is superior to VHS. You showed us that in Episode I. Great films, though.
B000000W5L|5.0|Recorded in the huge basement underneath Keith Richards' mansion, \\"Exile....\\" is an enormously fun and challenging LP. The 18 tracks here are all acoustic, blues based, gospel inflected and darn near perfect. Mick Jagger sings as if he's slowly being buried alive and is clawing his way back to daylight. Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman lock into a groove and don't let up for a minute and the acoustic/electric interplay of Richards and guitarist Mick Taylor hold the whole shebang together. The sound is deliciously muddy and while I would normally compalin about such a production flaw, it actually works to this album's advantage. At times the lyrics are indecipherable (\\"I Just Want To See His Face\\") trite (\\"Happy\\")nonsensical (\\"Turd On The Run\\" & \\"Ventilator Blues\\") but the grooves are so airtight and catchy you can easily overlook the half-baked songwriting. \\"Sweet Virginia\\", with it's deliberately ragged harmonies and stomping rhythm is still my personal favorite, but the entire LP is a stunner. The key to enjoying \\"Exile...\\" is it's sound and dark texture, just surrender and you'll be rewarded for your effort.
B000002ADT|5.0|I could sing praise forever, for it is a truly magnificent recording, but it might fall on ears unconvinced. I promise you can buy this album and enjoy it, regardless of your interests in music. So much of Davis's musical legacy is woven into all forms of music, it's impossible to appreciate the impact of albums such as this. <br />After comparing it to the original version released by Columbia on CD (as opposed to this remaster), it's safe to say that the timing issues and sound quality are much improved, when compared to a parallel listening to vinyl. <br />The only negative thing I can think of is the alternate take on Flamenco Sketches that ends the album. It seems a little rough, and disrupts the mood created by the original set; I imagine it was introduced by Columbia in order to make the album more marketable, but I think it could have been safely let off.<br />If you do listen to this album and find it enjoyable (and you will), some other music you may find enjoyable is Miles Davis' Sketches of Spain, Bill Evans' Sunday at the Village Vanguard, and Cyrus Chestnut's Nut.
B00003CXI0|1.0|BOY was I surprised! Really surprised about that bad movie I'd just seen while leaving the theatre. Most people who have seen the movie know the Potter-universe as good as their pant pockets. Not me, but I really like kiddy-movies, it's always very entertaining and the kids mostly show up with enormous lust and fun for acting. Not little Harry. He's just REALLY terrible and it takes a lot for me to place such statement. His 3-hour-lasting-smile completly spoils his character, his look on the face doesn't change a bit - or if, then a little cute bit. He's been trapped in his tiny room for his whole so-far-childhood and is being &quot;released&quot; by his unimaginable destiny. There are two extreme situations but Harry (re)acts like he's just luckily found 5 Cents...<br />Storytelling is extremly inpatient, journeys between real and Magic-world are unspectacular and some scenes are just ridiculous, like the final chess-battle, where the other kid is riding the horse and acting as if the end of the world depends on him. Hey, you're just sitting on a chess horse probably made of wood you could jump off (or did somebody paste you on it?). The ideas are brilliant, the whole university-stuff is undoubtly very cool. Nevertheless: the things that happen in that environment are being prepared somehow &quot;carelessly&quot;. <br />I think the movie is more attractive to the people who've also read he book and some of them confess that the story is really difficult to follow the way it's being told in the movie. I had my troubles following the much-too-fast-paced storytelling. It's a MTV movie that requires a lot to stand throught the whole 3 hours!
B000003N7G|5.0|John Coltrane is well known for his technical prowess, as manifested on the impossible-to-play &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, but he truly distinguishes himself through his ability to hypnotize the listener with his intensely penetrating and spiritual saxophone work. Much of his work with his early 60's quartet was spent searching for a deeper emotionalism. 1962's Coltrane, though uneven, is an excellent example of the beginnings of this style, which is typefied by long, intense, modal soloing and a great facility with producing a variety of sounds, some rather uncouth, on the horn. 1964's Crescent shows Coltrane in a similarly contemplative form throughout, simplifying his style even more, to the point of playing only the head of &quot;Lonnie's Lament&quot;. But the ultimate crystallization of Coltrane's spirituality is the album that was his gift to God: A Love Supreme. A suite in four parts, this album calls into question where one &quot;song&quot; begins and the other ends. The album flows together in an amazingly natural way, and takes the listener on a ride accordingly.
B000065U1N|5.0|That's it. Shock Value. That's what is packed in this movie, folks. This movie doesn't have slow scenes like in most war movies. Almost the ENTIRE movie is fighting, blood, war. That's not necissarily a bad thing though, in my opinion anyway. This movie didn't have too mch charicter depth, but you still feel for the soldiers in Samolia. Charicter depth in movies comes from, long speach scenes mostly, to explain to the audience about a charicter's past and whatnot. But in actuality, if you're caught in a war, you don't have time to talk and walk around. Saving Private Ryan was different. It was based on multiple battles, and in between battles is where the charicter depth was created. This movie is based on one battle. No time for charicter depth. But the reason that you still feel for the soldiers, is from the shocking reality that they ACTUALLY went through this and they were EXTREMLY out numbered. Imagine if you and several and several buddies and buddies of theirs walked in to the middle of town, then everyone started shooting at you and the only way you could live is to fight your way to the next town. I can't count how many times my jaw hit the theatre floor. Scenes like when the Hummvees came back to base, and a young soldier looked in to see bullet holes, empty casings, and blood and gore/bone chunks, of his fallen soldiers, was really dramatic. War is NOT pretty, and this movie makes that, shockingly, clear. This movie is most definatly going to be in my DVD collection when it comes out.
0385121679|5.0|I've read a lot of books and this has to be one of the best. Very gripping, you can read for hours on end before you have to put it down, but only because your hands get sore holding the book! Mainly about a kid at the age of 5 who has a power to see into the future and/or read peoples thoughts, called The Shining. He starts getting visions of evil, murder, and (the classic word of the book) REDRUM. The evil comes, letting go a mighty wrath.
B00005YW4H|4.0|One of the most impressive debuts of recent memery, Jones uses her sensuous vocals and understated piano work to great effect. The material lacks variety in a couple of places, but there is far more to enjoy here than to second-guess. <br />This album does what a solid debut should do -- makes us want to see her perform it live and hope for a follow-up soon.
B00006690F|5.0|I can understand how some people well not like this,but the fact is this well be the best rap cd this year,and it is eqaul to his first,if not better,Marshall Mathers,is still a lot better. Anyway-here is the track listing and a comment with them.<br />White America-One of my favorite,the beat is ok,but the lyrics are amazing on how he relates to white america.<br />Business-One of the few happier songs on here,i usually skip it.<br />Cleaning Out My Closet- A near masterpeice,its great,takes shots at his mother once again,but in a more mature way.<br />Sqauredance- a political song on the thing going on with the world right now,i like the lyrics,but not the chorus.<br />Soldier-I couldnt stand it at first,i still hate the chorus but i skip that and just listen to the verses,they're pretty good,not one of my favorites.<br />Say Goodbye To Hollywood-I really like this one,i like the chorus,and the lyrics,the beat is ok also.<br />Drips-Words cant explain my hate for this <br />Without me-you've heard it<br />Sing for the Moment-The Areosmith sample is creative,but he gets a little too touchy feely,i still like it.<br />Superman-A bouncy song,i like the beat,it is a good club song<br />Halies Song-Yea,he cant sing,but you cant help but like it.<br />When The Music Stops-Eminems verse is good,but D-12 ...<br />Say What You Say-Its alright,i like the beat,but Dre comes weak,this was a rushed track<br />Till I collapse-this is a anthem for sure,nate makes this track my favorite slightly over cleaning out my closet.<br />My Dads Gone Crazy-A silly sort of song,exept the third verse,where the beat changes and em comes very ill.<br />I'd reccomend this to any rap fan.
B000050XEI|5.0|This woman was the ONLY artist endemic to the decade, whose work was worth purchasing in the 90s!! Her ethereal, noble music is kissed by the angels, in the temple, by the moonlight, wa-dee-doo-DAH!! NO ONE was up to her level, with the possible exception of 80s holdover Sting, and as far as I'm concerned, she ruled as Queen Regent of the decade's female artists. As male artists turned out sound-alike songs obviously imitating some predecessor and generally cranking out mediocre crud, Enya was turning out the music of the spheres, music where you could almost SEE the cherubim flying out of your speakers.<br />This is probably her best album, as far as exceptional melodies are concerned, beating out previous albums  &quot;Watermark&quot;, &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; and &quot;Memory Of Trees&quot;, matching her first epinymous album for sheer sweetness. Highlights are &quot;Wild Child&quot;, &quot;One By One&quot;, &quot;Lazy Days&quot; and, of course, the grossly overplayed &quot;Only Time&quot;. This is also the latest album by this present from Heaven to reach the Billboard top ten.<br />Personally, I can't wait for her next one....!
B000003N89|5.0|I'm dead-up, I really can't believe how modest she is when it comes to the talent she possesses.  I almost admire that quality about her.  That she could make it all sound so effortless, but still be so humble in her every word.  Put Diana Krall behind a piano along with her bassist Paul Keller and guitarist Russell Malone and she is somethin' else.  But then give her a set list of twelve standards from Nat King Cole during his much-overlooked days with the Trio in the 1940s, and she is gonna give you what you're looking for and more.  This is one of the best tribute albums I've ever heard, and instead of directly copying Cole's style, pianistically and vocally, she adopts the tunes on her own terms and allows the music and her influence to speak for itself.  Her playing is refined and mannered, her vocals, 'specially on the ballads are romantic and elegant, and overall she jus' brings somethin' truly special to the table.  <br />She kicks the up-tempo and mid-tempo numbers with class and style like 'I'm an Errand Girl for Rhythm' a perfect way to open the set, 'Hit that Jive Jack' in which her group joins her on the vocal sing-along, and one of my personal favorite Cole recordings 'Frim Fram Sauce', that bouncy little who-knows-what-the-hell-it-means number, but the real stand-outs are the lush ballads.  Hearing her sing tunes like 'You Call it Madness' and the absolutely stellar 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams', ah, it's that late night thang, fa'real, the kind that puts me in a smoky club at 2 a.m., the hour when everybody has gone home except the people with nothing to go home to but trouble.  I'll smoke a cigarette, throw one back, and then lay my head on the bar, close my eyes and get lost in the beautiful elegant sounds of Ms. Krall crooning 'I'm Thru with Love' into that microphone.  Oh, and when she sings 'A Blossom Fell', all the pain and heartache of the song comes pouring out.  I'm dead-up, I could cry listening to this song, and it's my personal favorite number she does on this album.  My other favorite directly follows it and that is 'If I Had You', in which Benny Green handles the piano, and Krall makes this a sorrowful, wistful number, very close to an all-out torch song.  This music has been given beautiful treatment by a true student of one of the greats.  Well, what else can I say, whether she's at the piano or singing, or both, she is somethin' special.  Nat would be proud.  This was the first piece of music I bought by her, an' I'm hooked.
B000066NW0|4.0|I bought this CD because my friend and I fell in love with &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;I'm With You.&quot;  I bought the CD, and what I heard was what sounded like a mix of Alanis Morissette, Gwen Stefani (Sk8er Boi), Michelle Branch, Pink, and I am sure a bunch of other artists I am leaving out.  &quot;Complicated,&quot; &quot;My World&quot;, and &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; are my favorite tracks.  If you like the artists listed above, you'll love Avril.  This is a great CD to sing with and if you are a lover of female rock artists, the CD is definitely worth buying

B00003CXB2|5.0|This picture is why we see movies. It is big, it is larger than life, and Sir David Lean took the art of motion pictures to its logical pinnacle with this movie. Every &quot;big&quot; movie aspires to tell its story on the same scale as Lawrence of Arabia, that is why it is a classic
B00003CX5P|5.0|There is NOTHING out there that could beat this DVD. This is how ALL DVDS should be released in the first place. It has all the extras that DVD buffs dream of. From exclusive commentary by the film makers, to deleted scenes, to documentaries, to multi-angle sequences, to featurettes, production photos, postesr, ad campaigns, and exclusive StarWars.com content. Absolutely amazing.<br />The picture quality cannot be beaten. When filmed digtally, it looks absolutely amazing on the movie screen. The transfer has absolutely no artifcats at all. It's just as clear as it was on the movie screen.<br />The sound is wonderful. The best sound is 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound. Many DVDs have this, but this DVD destroys all their quality. The podrace sequence shakes the walls, the lightsabers snap-hiss and hums echo through the air. Nothing can beat this.<br />The extras...Lucas proves he is a movie-making god. Just watching the making-of net featurettes will make you appreciate the film so much more. The hour-long documentary is stunning. The deleted scenes...they don't add much to the story at all, but it's always good to see deleted scenes around. The multi-angle sequnces blow away the multi-angle sequences on the Unbreakable DVD. Seeing the submarine chase and the first lap of the podrace from storyboards to animatics is just fun. The trailers...just brings back the excitement and anticipation of Episode I. The music video it just like a trailer. Nothing to special, but it's a wonderful piece of music. All in all, the best set of extras on any DVD.<br />Buy it, experience it, and love it.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Fair Warning is the best work by the original Van Halen line-up. This CD has it all. Although Unchained is the only song on this ablbum that gets any air play, the whole album is Rock solid. Sinners Swing rocks, When Push Comes to Shove will bring you back to earth with a R&amp;B thud. Outstanding album.
B00005TT77|3.0|...but it still has some merit.  I'm a pretty big Beatles fan, grew up with parents that were fans.  I bought this CD based upon the strength of Eddie Vedder's cover of &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; and found that much of the CD is highly enjoyable.<br />It's not the Beatles, if you are the sort of person that will be highly disturbed if it should not properly represent the Beatles, don't buy it.  Yes, all of the songs were John and/or Paul songs.  Yes, some of the covers are much less than stellar.  But I feel it's worth it for Eddie Vedder's cover, Rufus Wainwright's cover of All Across the Universe (beautiful), and Ben Harper's cover of Strawberry Fields.
0618084746|5.0|This novel -- astonishing in its power, being Carson McCuller's first -- has justly come to be considered to be a classic of modern American literature.  McCullers' creative prowess is breathtaking -- she has brought to life the 1930s American South, in a non-judgemental, gently-written yet cinematically focused style of prose that has few equals.  Her characters spring to life with all of their beauty and warts intact, all of their despair and hope, all of their love and hate, all of their joy and pain and anger.  The prejudice that existed (and, unfortunately, still exists in many places and hearts) -- against blacks, the poor, the uneducated, the politically radical -- is laid out before the reader in such a way as to allow us to make up our own minds about it.<br />Each of the characters in this wonderful novel seems to inhabit their own private pocket of loneliness.  There are those who dare to hope and dream -- chief among them the unforgettable Mick Kelly -- and they keep a tight rein on these hopes.  McCullers brings this point home well on p. 199:  '...by habit they shortened their thoughts so that they would not wander out into the darkness beyond tomorrow.'<br />The story evolves into a languidly expanding, yet unstoppable diaspora of desperate, lonely people -- all of whom seem to have at least part of their hopes for life focused on Singer, the mute who is at the center of this work.  The musical metaphors McCullers employs in Mick's life are brilliant in themselves -- but there are many brilliant things about this work, it is filled with them.<br />McCullers is a great example of a talented artist whose life was much too short -- but she has left us with an astounding body of work of the highest quality.
B000066NW0|5.0|Completely awesome! This chick is my new idol...lol One of my new fav albums...  I bought it yesterday and have been listening to it non-stop...This album is choice!  Avril has an amazing voice, where she can scream in one song and sing in another and sound great doing both!!!  Music is awesome as-well, some pop-ish catchy stuff ('complicated', 'sk8er boi'..), punk/rock ('losing grip', 'mobile'..), a little flowing in one of the songs ('too much to ask') and then you hav your slower songs ('i'm with you' (my fav.) and 'tomorrow') Every song is awesome! ...BUY IT, it's worth it!!!
B000066NW0|3.0|Avril is a cool artist but punk? I hightly doubt this. She has to constantly remind everyone she's a punk skater girl.<br />Her music is cool though, more like pop with the guitars, but cool anyway. So check her out if that's what you like.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver was about a boy named Jonas and his perfect world.  He had everything going great.  His friends were always there for him, there was no war, and no pain at all.  Everything was in peace.  When he turned twelve, he was assigned a special role like no other.  Jonas was selected to receive special training from an elder man, who was called the Giver.  The Giver showed him things that happen in the real world, introduced Jonas to things such as snow, sleds, runners, colors, downhill, and many other things that we experience in normal life.  Then it was finally time for Jonas to get the truth, so he showed him the pain and pleasure of living a \\"real\\" life.  <br />My favorite part in this book was when the \\"Ceremony on Twelve's.\\"  It just came around the corner.  This event shows a group of children who are to turn twelve.  All of the children were assigned a job.  These are the jobs that they must attend to for the rest of their lives.  During this event, Jonas was the last to receive a task.  This part was very exciting.  <br />Overall, I think that this book was great!  It had a lot of cliffhangers.  I couldn't stop reading on and on.  It was an extremely exciting book.  I would definitely recommend this book to readers who enjoy suspenseful stories because this is definitely one.  Read this book!! It's very exciting!
B000066JES|5.0|After 7 years Manowar finally puts out a new studio album, and it definitely rocks, but you'd think by now that they'd realize that we don't want the one or two stupid songs that they always have to put on their albums. There are a few tracks on this album that you'll probably want to skip, so the album isn't solid, but there's a lot of triumph and promoting of Manowar. Amazingly, the word \\"loser\\" is not said once on the album as this is one of the most positive albums about victory, honor, pride, thunder, wind, rain, steel, blood, and Manowar. Probably their 2nd best album next to Kings of Metal or Louder than Hell. A must have for any man who loves to hail and kill!
0140186395|4.0|John Steinbeck's East of Eden is an exemplary story of the battle of humans struggling to make choices. What I liked most about the book was Steinbeck's ability to characterize without favoritism or bias. I enjoyed each character not because s/he was \\"good\\" but because Steinbeck (with the exception of Cathy), made every character a real human, with emotions, good and bad. The balance Steinbeck created amazed me and made the plot exciting and unpredictable. Steinbeck's honesty and frankness helped recreate a story that was real and enjoyable. The lines of humor spread through the book made me smile: I could not put the book down. Furthermore, there were many parts where I noticed Steinbeck's skill as a storyteller, and as I flipped back to previous places in the book, I saw how all the parts were intertwined and weaved together. This is an amazing book; even if you've never liked Steinbeck before, the spiritual and intellectual value will capture and win you.
0140186395|5.0|In East of Eden, Steinbeck craftily analyzes and challenges many aspects of human nature. He expressly voices a powerful message in 'Timshel', meaning that people hold the choice over their fate and over their defeats. Steinbeck conveys this idea passionately throughout the book as he represents the story of Cain and Abel between two generations of brothers. East of Eden rejoices in the human spirit and is made to inspire one in time of trial. Since Steinbeck portrays life where one can overcome defeat, he captivates people with the ability to triumph.<br />Through compellingly lifelike characters, he constructs the human spirit and shapes them with infinite shades of darkness and virtue. Characters such as Sam Hamilton, Cathy Ames, and Lee are deployed to depict the free and inventive soul, reclusive guilt, austerity, and the influence of religion and human power. Steinbeck not only employs the characters with superficial features, but investigates these character's souls to communicate a deeper understanding of their nature. East of Eden's portrayal of human phsyche and universal philosophy is magnificently strewn and engrossing.
B00005JL3A|5.0|It won't win an Oscar, but who cares.  I totally loved this movie, I can see it over and over, the special effects were cool and the lead actresses, YUMMY!<BR>Buy this if you want mindless entertainment, if your looking for great cinema-watch the evening news.  The soundtract rocks!!!
1573225517|4.0|Read the book because it is insightful regarding relationships from the male perspective,because it gives a glimpse into the mind of a fanatic collector(music or other), or  because it's doggone entertaining. But read the damn book. The protagonist decides to examine his life after, as is often the case, a painful episode in his life. Normally this type of book is a turn off to most men, but this book is so funny, and so dead on accurate that you don't mind taking the trip through Rob's(the protagonist) psyche. <BR> The humor comes in many forms. Rob's co-workers provide some hefty laughs with their top 5 lists, sarcasm and realistic portrayal of music geeks. Rob himself supplies many laffs with his self effacement and irony. And the turns the story takes itself are sometimes hilarious, sometimes just strange.( Wait til you find out what happens at the funeral of Rob's ex's father)<BR> The poignancy and depth of the book sneaks up on ya. One minute your chuckling over Rob's frustration with fans of Phil Collins, the next your sharing in a truthful,sometimes almost brutally so, insight into his mind.<BR> I guess what I'm trying to say is that any book that can take a self -obsessed guy's ruminating on music,relationships and life in general, and keep me interested because of the humor and truthfulness of the inner and outer dialogues, is a damn fine book. Try it. It makes soul searching fun!!!
0385334206|4.0|This book really isn't about the story so much as it is about criticizing society. The satire is way more important than the story. In fact, there isn't much of a plot here. He often totally leaves it to be satirical, creating a very minor character or the plot of a book written by Kilgore Trout to do this. He does it very well, but is not one for subtlety; in most isntances it is very obvious what he is trying to say. However, I dare you not to laugh at some of the shots he takes at society.<br />I found his writing style annoying as the novel began, though I adapted. He is too cynical at some points, and too condesceding in others. I did laugh a lot, though.<br />A mistake I made was that this was the first novel I read by Vonnegut. I should have read Slaughterhouse-Five first (it is better and a good introduction to him). I did read it after, and am planning on reading Cat's Cradle soon enough. <br />I definitely would recommend this novel, but you may want to introduce yourself to Vonnegut before you do.
B00006690H|5.0|this is the greatest album ever created.  My favorite song is Halie's song, its different but awesome.  Some other good songs are superman, soldier, square dance, and till i collapse.  Eminem features aerosmith in sing for a moment, and dr. dre in say what you say.  I would recommend buying this as quickly as you can go to the store.  (edited version is my favorite, go mormons)
B000000Y87|5.0|Scott Laforo's bass playing alone makes this an incredible album. Nobody before this was doing what he did on the bass. He treated the bass a as a lead instrument while still providing a canvas for Bill to paint his impressionistic solos over. Bill is at his peak here as well. Bill Evans and Art Tatum are often considered to be the greatest jazz pianists ever. While Art Tatum may have been faster, Bill just has a style and feel that no one can top. His influences from Debussy and Ravel add to this. He would never match this except with his duets with Jim Hall and his last trio with the drummer Joe LaBarbara. Take 2 of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard. The clicking of drinks and talking of the audience in the background makes you feel as if you were at the Vanguard that night. This is a perfect introduction to Evans' work and one of the most beautiful albums in jazz.
0783219598|5.0|They released a fullscreen DVD version with NO extras.  How dare they do that to a film shot so beautifully and carefully as this one!  It deserves WIDESCREEN and extras.<br />The film itself is 5 star... this DVD is 0.  And I round 2.5 to 2.  Until the next release of the DVD at fullscreen you may as well stick to your video tape version! :(<br />EDIT: IT's FINALLY OUT IN WIDESCREEN!!!!! WOOT!!!!!!!!
0553278223|3.0|I really enjoyed the novel The Martian chronicles by Ray Bradbury.It was a very intresting, and at times disturbing book. The novel records the events that take place on a number of expeditions to the planet Mars. My favorite part of the book was pages 48 to 59.This part of the book is about an expediton  that when the crew gets to Mars everyone's dead relatives were on the planet. This is a very intersting piece of sci-fi. Even though at sometimes it did ddrag,but i still reconmend it.
B0000636UN|2.0|Sheryl Crow is one of the most renowned popular singer/songwriters around. I have never really enjoyed any of her previous work, but I gave this one an unbiased fair shot.<br />It's cotton candy. There are some really catch tunes here: 'Soak Up the Sun,' 'Steve Mcqueen,' 'You're an Original.' The problem is that this very little musical or lyrical substance to any of it. <br />Crow is indicative of what the mainstream music industry has become. She churns out an album every few years and feigns to know what it's like to be an ordinary joe on the street in her pseudo-confessional style. She may not be ordinary but this music  sure is.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I have waited for ths for a long time. I thought that the DVD would be much more advanced in flavor than expected. They made such a big deal and it didn't even have a special look at the second movie. I paid extra money just to get it on the &quot;Special&quot; DVD.
B00003CXI1|3.0|The movie is great and true to the book.  The DVD is an atrocity.  Someone had no clue about user interface design.  The special features are unimpressive and it takes forever to get anywhere.  I do  not know who thought following an intricate 18 step process to get to the deleted scenes would be fun.  For a video game with controllers, great, with a remote in hand, preposterous.  There are few interviews and no commentaries.  You get two disks full of annoying and ridiculous graphics..I would be insulting game designers everywhere if I refered to them otherwise.  They should release a new single disk DVD with the movie and some decent features that you can reach in a straightforward manner.
B00005OWEG|4.0|...provided a better way to see both versions.  New scenes are identified in the scenes menu, but it would have been nice to be able to see the old version &quot;straight through&quot; via the same DVD and compare it to &quot;redux&quot;. (I suppose there might be technical problems with that, but I could live with a hiccup or two as the new &quot;redux&quot; scenes were skipped).  On balance, I agree with those who think &quot;redux&quot; is not really an improvement.  It's cool to see the extra scenes, but they don't add enough to the movie to justify themselves.
B000002UB3|5.0|Simply, Side 2 of Abbey Road is the crowning achievement not only of the Beatles, but of Rock Music, to date. And for once, I'll bet I am not a lone voice. Now go review the rest.
0790731479|5.0|What can I say? This is a CLASSIC! I've seen this movie so many times I actually have most of the words memorized. This movie is hilariously funny, but at the same time it has a touch of drama in it. It's an all around great movie.<br />Michael Keaton does an excellent job of playing the odd, funny, and perverted Beetlejuice who causes quite the chaos with a newly deceased couple, Adam and Barbara. Let me just say no one and I mean NO ONE could've been better for the part of Beetlejuice.<br />The only disapointting thing about the DVD Beetljuice is there were no deleted scenes or extra footage.. I was disapointed, but I love this movie so much it was still worth it!<br />If you haven't seen Beetlejuice, then YOU MUST SEE IT. And for all the Beetlejuice lovers and fans out there this is a must have to your video or DVD collection~
B000066NW0|4.0|Where do I start?  Avril Lavigne is a very talented new artist whom I predict will be HUGE.  First of all, she has amazing vocal talent.  Her voice is very pretty and yet powerful, and she has an incredible vocal range, which she shows in &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; and &quot;Losing Grip&quot;.  (Losing Grip is my personal favorite :).)  She has a catchy and unique sound that goes far beyond that of &quot;Complicated&quot;.  It's girly and yet tough and punky at the same time.  The reason I didn't give it all 5 stars is because of her lyrics.  Some of her lyrics sound a LITTLE bit thrown-together (mainly &quot;Too Much to Ask&quot;).  Then again, it's her first album, plus she's a teenager who's all about self-expression.  Anyway, overall, I think it's a great album.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie is hilarious! I laughed so hard! I fell in love with the characters. It's just one of those movies that you can't resist. I was like &quot;this is a kid's movie. Should I watch it?&quot; Well I went ahead and watched it. This is a classic.. it's not just a children's movie. There's a few &quot;inside jokes&quot; that adults will get but the kids won't. I was surprised at how many people actually fell in love with this movie. I wonder.. did more adults or kids love this movie? :-) I know I love it!
0446678430|1.0|This book is filled with so many innaccuracies and errors of omission that I would not recommend it. The information on stocks and financial planning is incomplete and erroneous. For ex:The writer talks profusely of the tax consequences of owning mutual funds,yet fails to mention any of the great tax shelters available to remedy this problem. Roth IRA's, Education savings plans, and Tax efficient mutual funds(index funds) are available to practically everyone on this planet and mitigate these tax consequences. Not a word on this! This is financial planning 101 stuff which is always the foundation of a solid financial plan. P/E ratio's are described wrong. Too much quack theory and very little practical advice.  Another thing, starting a business CAN be profitable, but for MOST is not. Most businesses FAIL and therefore should only be started by people who have it to lose. The vast majority of folks are best off with a allocated MIX of stocks, bonds, cash, and real estate. This mix is determined by your Time horizon, risk tolerance, and education level(i.e a real estate agent may be comfortable with more real estate holdings) Loading up on any one of these asset catagories at the expense of another will increase your risk-another basic missing from this book.
B000066NW0|5.0|If u like Alanis, Pink, and Michelle Branch, u will definetly love Avril Lavigne! She kicks [rear]. I just got the cd today, and I reccomend all of you do the same!
0783227019|4.0|Wow!!! This movie was GREAT! I first saw this film when it came out in 1993 and I really didnt understand it but I just got done watching it and it was just terrific Al Pacino was great and so was Sean Penn and so was Penelope Ann Miller they all work so well together on screen and Brian De Palma has made in my opinion yet another classic. I've only seen one other movie by him \\"SCAR FACE\\" but they are both so well made I can't say what one was better all I can say is this is one of Al Pacino's best work and it still proves to me that he is one of the great actors of our time. The movie starts great right from the start.. Sprung from prison on a legal technicality by his cocaine- addled attorney (Sean Penn), former drug kingpin Carlito Brigante (pacino) stuns the local underworld when he vows to go stright. taking a job managing a glitzy , low-life nightclub, he tracks down his onetime girlfriend (Penelope Ann Miller) and rekindles their romance, promising he's changed for good. But Carlito's dream or going to legitimate is undermined at every turn by a murderous former cronies and even deadlier young thugs out to make a name for themselves. Untimately, however, his most dangerous enemy is himself. Despite good intentions, Carlito's misguided loyalties and outmoded code of \\"HONOR\\" will plunge him into a savage life-or-death battle against the relentless forces that refuse to let him go.
B000066NW0|5.0|I was eagerly anticipating the release of Let Go for about a month before it actually came out, but I never dreamed it would be this good!  While Avril Lavigne has been stuck in the same category as Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton (who are both talented artists in their own right), Lavigne has a very different sound, and, frankly, I like her music better.  The songs are catchy and somewhere between rock and pop with an edge to it, and the variety of styles on the CD is great!  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants something different, an artist with actual talent.  Avril's voice is unique (in a good way...she's definitely no nasally Britney!) and her music is superb!  Definitely worth the money!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Hypnotic, beautiful, and at moments legitimately terrifying, this is Lynch at his unsettling best.  The self-destructive insecurities at the heart of the Hollywood 'dream' are the subject this time, and Lynch dissects them with a chilling precision - which probably accounts for the ludicrous lack of Oscars.  But I suppose in a year in which the hallowed Academy also saw fit to ignore 'Memento', what else could we expect?  Lynch is easily the most original and consistently interesting director working in America today.  You owe it to yourself to see this film and discover just how different and challenging a movie can be.  Don't be daunted by the phalanx of reviewers who deplore its impenetrability.  It's a simple story you've seen many times before, just told in a different way.  So take the ride, and see what you make of it.  At the very least you won't be bored - which is more than we can say for many Oscar winners.
B000002JS6|5.0|Maybe the most representative album for classic hard rock, it is my all time favourite, at least as far as rock music is concerned. <BR>Every time I listen to it I wonder what happened to rock, why is it you can't hear stuff like this any more.<BR>All tracks are great, which is something else that doesn't happen any longer on recent albums, regardless of the artist. Whether you like AC/DC very much or not particularly so, this is something anybody that has any liking for rock at all will find absolutely great. This music makes you feel like there's no worry in the world that can bring you down, it's like you're ten feet tall, nothing can touch you and you can only have good time every day of your life.<BR>If you want to have a complete picture of what hard rock is about, you cannot do whithout it.I highly recommend it.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Once again, Hollywood underestimates the intelligence of its audience by torturing a socially-conscious novel into an over-hyped, under-cooked, popcorn movie. Do the guys at Dreamworks seriously believe we are so unintelligent that we cannot cope with a decent adaptation? Would we all run screaming from the cinema, demanding our money back because there weren't enough romantic scenes, chase sequences, plot holes, or cortex-splintering special effects?  Or maybe their reasoning is more sinister: perhaps a dystopian fantasy about an effete leisure class living off the misery of a race of underlings is simply too close to the actual relationship between Hollywood executives and the audience. But hey, it wasn't all bad, I guess. The time machine itself was beautiful, and the initial trip to 2030 was superbly done. The music wasn't bad, either. And Guy Pearce did a fine job, given what he had to work with. I just wish Hollywood would leave sci-fi novels alone - or have the guts to do them properly.  If you want to tell your own time travel story, fine.  Go do it.  But don't call it 'The Time Machine' and try to trade on the success of novel you clearly don't respect.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is the kind of film that you will watch and then see it again... and again.    It has so many hidden layers of social criticism that I was just impressed and fascinated with what the director intended to convey in this (beautifully shot) work of art.  The direction is perfect, the acting is flawless (even Meat Loaf and Jared Leto put on some wonderful performances), the storyline is twisted, intelligent, and carried out at the right pace.  <br />What makes Fight Club the great movie that all reviews below tout it to be?  Its radical criticism of modern consumerism is just one of many reasons.  Another one is its call for intelligent anarchy, one which seeks to awaken the modern man from the robotic position that social norms have designed and assigened to him.  One more reason would be the fact that it deals with one of humanity's primal insticts: violence.  Its depiction of violence as an art and a release from modern stagnation makes this movie, without a doubt, one of the best flicks of the past decade (and, certainly, of all time).<br />As far as this DVD goes, it is worth every penny that we pay for it.  The original and artsy packaging is just one reason.  The extras and quality of the DVD itself is the other.  It is definitely worth buying.  Just renting wouldn' allow the viewer for further exploration of this brilliant film.
0767836286|4.0|An engaging if slightly melodramatic thriller, distinguished by the bravery of its shockingly downbeat ending.  Kruger's thematically strong and neatly structured screenplay doesn't pull any punches with its climax, and that's the way it should be.  That even the most earnest opponents of terror can still be manipulated by it, and by the way it's reported, is the whole point of this story.  So I'm astonished that so many reviewers criticize the ending.  Does every film have to leave you with a warm and fuzzy glow?  Can't a movie actually be ABOUT something?  Even something important?  Of course it can, but that sometimes means the viewer has to take a pretty solid kick in the guts.  Congratulations to Kruger, Pellington and their financial backers for having the nerve to go through with this.  And shame on an audience who, in the same year, spent almost five times as much on tickets to 'Wild Wild West.'  For the love of God, America.  Wake up to yourselves before it's too late.
