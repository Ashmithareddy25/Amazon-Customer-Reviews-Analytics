B009KS4XRO|5.0|My husband and son have played this for months on the Kindle and laptop. I just never realized what a great game it was until I received my Samsung Galaxy Tablet for Mother's Day/My Birthday and downloaded the app. I love it.  There was one day that I 'spent' bingo coins on cards for a game, then the game froze. I simply sent a help message to the easy-to-find service contact, and they refunded my coins, no questions asked. New games added regularly for seasonal fun. You do not have to spend your own money to have fun with this game. You get so many tokens free daily, plus 5 hands of the daily tournament.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|easy gameplay- pretty much just a fun twist on farmville!  Runs like a charm- if you have issues, just restart
B001JYEMOQ|4.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the buffoonish snob Freddie Miles outdoes Patricia Highsmith's original character. Instead of being beaten to death with a heavy ashtray, he is brained by a marble bust of Caesar Augustus (or someone like that). This is a death slightly more appropriate, and perhaps an improvement on the original.<br /><br />Most of the other players are just adequate. You can't blame the actors, generally; it's a problem with the script. The East-50s bird-bar gay culture that Highsmith recalled from Manhattan of the late 1940s is completely written out, so you don't have the maybe-queer-maybe-not backstory of Thomas Ripley, which provided so much underpinning of the novel's action. Gwyneth Paltrow does a fair job with Marge, the rich boy's girlfriend. She is so bland, however, in both novel and movie, that the screenwriters give us an extra female character (Cate Blanchett) to balance out the cast.<br /><br />Jude Law just misses as rich boy Dickie Greenleaf, the shipbuilding scion whom Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) is supposed to spy on, and winds up murdering. Law doesn't \\"read\\" correctly as a wealthy young American expatriate who dabbles in painting. The screenwriters substitute a Jazz fixation for the art interest. This makes Dickie seem more like a rich hipster than the Hemingwayesque brute/aesthete that Highsmith created. Law's Dickie is sufficiently hateful, so we don't mind when he's murdered by Tom Ripley in a rowboat off the Cote d'Azur (as in the novel). But since the homosexual suspicions are removed from the script, Tom's immediate motivations for killing him are unclear.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I like this game as it is multilayered and doesn't require coins or any of the crazy things that are needed to do different things within the game. My only negative is that it requires many uses of the hints go figure out what the next step is.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app all the time! I have the two versions that I use most downloaded and I love it.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|Great story idea, good dialogue and strong female characters: this book has everything a picky reader could want. Stick with this series,  book #2 is even better!
B00B7IJDMA|5.0|Great, only wish they put more cuts on it. I loved all but one. Could listen to this many times and did.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|We didn't know what to expect so we really enjoyed the unfolding of the story.  The images were magical and dramatic.
B00C1BHQXK|3.0|Well written but light on content. Anyone who is caught up in a overtasked, multi-tasked life already knows that focused proactive effort is more effective than scattered reactive crisis management.
8866135887|4.0|I'm a student and I think this planner, of all the Moleskine ones I've had, is the perfect size and layout. Aside from the sticker sheets all Moleskine planners come with, this includes an insert of blank, lined, tabbed pages on which you can jot extra notes, memos, places to see, etc. and the planner includes sticker labels (blank and titled) for you to put on. Love it, but it is a hard cover (which I didn't realize when purchasing) - I do prefer the softer covers a little more.
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|Good film, wasnt the cheese fest I thought it was going to be.  The Story isnt drowned out by action, but what action there is... is great.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easy to use and gas much more useful information than other free weather apps. The graphs are very good.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Best deal I've seen on this set.  Recieved  within promised time.  Am in process of watching now, everything fine so far.
B002M87V0A|1.0|I was so disappointed with my order that was sent.  I had gotten 3 dvd's that I had ordered but the 4th one that ordered,\\"The Music Man\\"  came in blue ray form.  I do not have a blue ray player nor do I ever intend to purchase one.  So the film that I was looking forward to seeing was of no use to me.  I'm sure it is a superb movie.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|This movie was action packed and leaves you wanting more. It was everything I had hoped for. A great movie!
B00006ZXSK|4.0|This movie was done very well in real life characters.  I really enjoyed the great acting in this film.  It makes it enjoyable to watch, even for a grownup.
0345529057|3.0|Story is great.  Even if you've already watched the series the book is still awesome.  You become better connected to the characters.  The only downside is that the pages are so thin.  I always feel like i'm going to tear them when i flip pages.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Another great season, can't wait for next one. There have been a lot of turns and twist. Gibbs is in trouble but  I'm sure hell get out of it OK.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love playing this game. it is very addictive. even got my finance hooked on it. now we love playing it together
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have excellent accuracy with this keyboard. The word prediction is very good and saves me a lot of time. Definitely worth the cost of the app.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This is a great movie. I can't see how someone wouldn't like it. Great story, great acting, and great comedy.
0060837020|5.0|I have never read this particular work by Sylvia Plath, but as always I was not disappointed.  I could not put it down.  Her detailed account of a nervous breakdown captured and held my interest from the first page.  I highly recommend if you are a Plath fan.  If you are not, yet, you certainly will be after this read.
B008JFUO72|5.0|The people who didn't like Iron Man 3 are the reason why Michael Bay gets to keep making movies.  Seeing Iron Man \\"out of the suit\\" and still kicking ass, still being a hero, was awesome.  Robert Downey Jr. defined the role, and in Iron Man 3 they let him play Tony Stark as much as they let him play Iron Man.  Movies with character, movies with depth, we need these, and it kills me that so many people hate on Iron Man 3 because that implies they just want a big mechanical suit shooting stuff for two hours, ala Saturday Morning cartoons.  To me, that says that we lack the attention span to enjoy a film with depth, character, and humor.  Iron Man 3 was a huge film, a huge success, and a ton of fun.<br /><br />I loved every minute, and unless you're one of those people that caused films like Transformers 2 to get made... you know who you are... then you too will love Iron Man 3.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|You would think being a \\"complete\\" edition of a series, especially on Blu-ray, it would actually be that. But buyer beware, it is not. I originally watch this series on the DVD edition, the true \\"complete\\" editions, that contained all the none edited footage. So to my dismay, after paying close to $200, this set kept leaving out scenes I knew we're there. The reviews for this set, which I didn't read until after I bought this set unfortunately, warned me not get it. Too late :(. It's only the stunted versions of each episode that aired on TV. Also it is in wide screen format, which is great because they boasted that Friends was originally recorded that way, but all they did was zoom in to get that effect, removing even more than the TV versions. You would think that after that much wait and that much of a cost, NBC would produce a \\"full\\" collection, but again we are the victims of the corporate greed machine. So do yourself a favor and get the DVD editions that say bonus footage because video quality is that of a DVD, not Bluray so you won't be missing in that department. So, yes, DO NOT BUY THIS!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game a lot of fun to compete with facebook friends. Although there are a lot of buy to win asspects ob the game, and it is constently trying to shove deals down your throat.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is a true movie about a family that is vacationing on an island and get hit by hide tidal waves and what they have to do to try and survive, IF POSSIBLE?
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Amazing, just gorgeous music.....I could listen to this anytime.  His genius, soul exposing lyrics, & rich voice, blended with the accompanying musicians, saxophone, harmonica, guitars; it is just a wonderful way to experience Leonard's genius. I simply adore this music.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The story was well written, exciting and highly entertaining. The 80's being the main theme of the book made it somewhat of a treasure hunt for the 80's inspired plot points and references. The mix of love, sci-fi and adventure was perfect and harmonious. In my opinion, Ernest Cline hit a home run with this book!
B0058SNI94|5.0|These shoes run a bit big. I ordered an eight to fit my regularly 8 1/2 size foot. That fits fine. Otherwise they are just great! I can shop or work on my feet for hours wearing them without fatigue in my legs or feet. They look acceptable to wear in most casual situations too. Just an all around good buy!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|For anyone who likes 80's music, this movie is a real pleasure to watch.  All the performers (especially Tom Cruise) are wonderful in it.  There's no graphic sex scenes but a few so suggestive that I wouldn't recommend it for younger children.
B0000047GA|5.0|Tony Williams - Emergency<br /><br />  My first encounter with el-drummer-extraordinaire was during my Miles Davis days but it was my boosom pal Doug who &#34;put me on the track to burn a little brighter now&#34; with the solo albums of Willams.<br />  Emergency was a very influential album back in 1969 and is considered one of the watermarks in the Fusion genre still today.<br /><br />The Tony Williams Lifetime was a combo of Williams,  guitarist John McLaughlin and organist Larry Young aka  (aka Khalid Yasin) .  Musically this is pure fusion !  Gigantic drumming and percussion with endless organ grinds, riffs and swirls all held together by the dynamic and ever changing creativity of McLaughlin's fret work!<br /><br /> &#34; Emergency&#34; had a profound impact on Miles Davis who would recruit this band for work on his masterpiece &#34;in a silent way&#34;.  No question that &#34;emergency&#34; also spurred on The Mahav and Return To Forever revolution of FUSION!  It was an original album full of strange and very unique sounds and at first was shun by the jazz and rock world and it wasnt until years later that this album was truely discovered and appreciated.<br /><br />  &#34;Emergency&#34; is definitely NOT an audiophile's dream......in fact my copy comes with a  disclaimer saying it was poorly recorded — two albums in two days! And acknowleded that the original eight-track tape was distorted, but regardless Polydor released this as a double vinyl record set with sound flaws et all!  .....but to be honest it is this imperfect live electric vibe that I like about this album and I persoanlly would not want it any other way!<br /><br />  In many ways this album reminds me of King Crimson with a mix of acid jazz and rock with progressive characteristics.....check out the song &#34;Spectrum Road&#34; with its Robert Fripp like guitar work!<br /><br /> Vocals are aptly handled by Williams himself and although not an overly vocal intensive album, he does a reasonable job !<br /><br />This is an essential album !  Dont let fusion scare you or the age ofnthis recording.....it is an essential gem!e job !<br /><br />This is an essential album !  Dont let fusion scare you or the age ofnthis recording.....it is an essential gem!
159463176X|2.0|I could not wait to read this book and then I was so let down.  I read all the good reviews and usually fall with the majority, but not this time. Khaled is such a gifted story teller that it is hard to believe he wrote this book. It was not a smooth sail.  Some of the story lines were most uninteresting and some never finished.  It jumped all over the place and was hard to follow, by the time I was nearing the end I skimmed just to finish it. If you must read it get it from the library.
B00B4804KS|5.0|If you have 3-D available on your TV set with the necessary 3-D glasses to get the full effect, you will be surprised how different the video is from the original release in 1989.  Hold on to your seats and enjoy!  Yeah, it's still scary as the dickens, only much more so.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|It was fast paced, super confusing, and well...  Just not my cup-o-tea.  Glad it was part of the amazon free app of the day and I was able to try it.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|This is a series we really enjoyed, as there was always a 'surprise twist' that kept us captivated.  If you don't mind a little violence then you probably will enjoy this video, as it takes you back to the 1930's 'gangster style'.  Yes, the acting is very good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was skeptical of a free app, but this turned out to be a good game. The puzzles were challenging while still being fun. I am glad I gave it a try!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The best part of card games on the Kindle Fire is not having to shuffle a deck of cards!  This game is easy to play and very enjoyable.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Everybody needs an explorer some android devices have my files app which functions like one but this gives you a lot of control. This is almost industry-standard.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This was recommended to me by my sister-in-law.  I am glad I added it to my Kindle because it's lots of fun and different every time.
630471193X|1.0|The movie was too damn small for the screen.  So if you like watching tiny versions of things, this is the product for you!!

B009ZXT4BY|1.0|It wud be more fun if it gave u more time it is a cool game but the only purpose for the demo is when u run out of time they want u to buy it which I think sucks
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|My 4-year-old grandson found it a joy...for about 5 minutes, then was totally done with it. For my part, I created a few dense designs and would have done more but for lack of specific instructions. If they're there, it's a mystery where they might be.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun!  Would recommend...makes you think!  Need more rooms.  You just get the hang of the game and you run out of rooms.
B004GYY714|3.0|Pandora alternative, but not as slick...however, the GLOBAL component is a boon! Easy to use, and works well on my Kindle Fire.
1400095204|5.0|Adichie is one of those writers who spoil you for almost every writer you read after her. I agree with another reviewer who said she wished she hadn't read the book so fast. But in the heat of reading it, I couldn't stop myself. The story, well described by other reviewers, was compelling and sad. The characters will roll around in my memory for a long time, I am sure. Finding a book like this is like finding not a needle, but a diamond, in a haystack. I wish I had taken myself and the book to a seaside room for a weekend, shut the door, and ordered in until I was done reading and thinking. I envy you, because you could do it. Better yet, take a week and pack all her books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is a great take on the distopic novel.  The characters are well developed and woven together with skill and care.<br /><br />At one point, I began to care about the antagonist.  It takes a lot of skill to write a villain that is well rounded.<br /><br />Well done Hugh Howey
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Read thru the book, so many twists and turns and plots... I think the author was trying to show you how many times there was a &#34;connection&#34; that could have been made... But wasn't?
B0090KZDSK|4.0|A great read.<br />This whole series has been great. Keeps you interested the whole way. Highly recommend it to all
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this game yesterday for my Kindle Fire, and I can't put it down!  The graphics are great and the courses are varied enough to keep interest.
B000FVE3BG|4.0|The watch is beautiful.  I wanted big and I got BIG.  The tan leather band is striking and against the gold and blue face of the watch it's just a good looking accessory.  Haven't had it long enough to comment on how it keeps time.  But I have other Invicta Watches and they've always performed well.  The price, under $100, is perfect.  Much more expensive looking.  You can't go wrong.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|The idea of the game is good, but the controls are tough.  It is not clear where you can place cubes, and it's difficult to place them where you want to.  A very frustrating game.
B00AALHW6Y|4.0|You need to get  the song Radio on the Radio it might the best song on the CD. I can't wait to see him in Paso Robles!!
B00DGNOMB6|1.0|I love the movie, but this recording stopped right in the middle of the story and wouldn't play anymore. I never had this issue before, but it is happening now. I want my money back.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I rated this a five because I have enjoyed every single season and have got several friends and relatives hooked as well.<br />The characters develop and their relationships change and grow.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|Singing in the Rain!  What's not to like?  Great talent, great music, great fun.  And our grand daughter loves it.
1781162646|4.0|A wonderful change in King's genre.  But, as usual, his character development is great.  I have already share it with others.
B005BX3NAA|5.0|I think they should of put more of GNR's hits like Nightrain, Mr. Brownstone, Dust n' bones. Definitely do buy!!
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I should have known better....<br />If the rating system would accept \\"zero\\", then it would get ZERO!  However, for the new agers out there, this movie has it all.....big corporate oil bombs a passenger plane in order to kill one man........all of the white people but two are evil and one of those is a coward........heart warming, weepy \\"true love\\" (homo-sexual)......and finally, in the end all is good because we are now all one, beige colored race..........<br />They even managed to make Halle Berry un-attractive!  Don't waste your hard earned money!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Have uninstalled and installed twice and it does nothing. Was really excited about playing this game.<br /> What am I doing wrong?? Help??
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very tricky, but intriguing. I enjoy the challenge. Very different from the other games I have tried.
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|Gripping mystery drama. My kind of airport fiction! At first, you sort of wonder why we're spending so much time getting to know these teenagers, Neil and Rachel and Jack Callahan, but as the mystery unfolds and becomes embroiled in their school -- all the plot threads start coming together and everything starts to make sense. And then the threesome thing happens! Wow. I really want to know what's going to happen next! \\"Bodies: Staged Fright\\" is told from the point of view of the youngest kid, Neil, who feels like the outcast in a family of very extreme individuals. Almost too extreme. Some of the characters feel borderline farcical at times, but since the overall tone feels like a fun, tongue-in-cheek Hollywood story, that's not a big problem. Overall, this is a very entertaining book! I'd recommend it for a quick, fun read.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I think its funny how amazon is saying the dvd boxed set is worth $149.99 but will give it to you at a discounted price of $98.96 at a %51.03 discount lol. I went to movie stop and preordered the boxed set and the set is only going to cost me $39,99 to $49.99 they arent sure the price yet cause they want to be the cheapest in price . so if you have a moviestop go to them.  for the price this sites asking you can get 2 to 3 of them.

B00D02Z1EA|4.0|This album surprised me in so many ways. The very first were the vocals which I had addressed in my review of Leveler as being pretty straightforward are augmented to become a highlight in many cases of the album!  The lows are LOW growls, and the annunciation is perfect, letting you hear and understand everything. They have added a semi melodic yelling style of singing that accentuates a couple tracks.  The lyrics surprised me in the case of \\"Treatment\\" whereby Jake Luhrs screams his disapproval of religious zealots who live for the afterlife and don't do anything to make the world a better place.  Also his lyrics in the next song  \\"Spirit Breaker\\" has a very candid spoken word section where he speaks of love, longing, a quick thank you to god, then screams the same lyrics in the spiraling and enthralling finale. Both are a little uncharacteristic of these guys but work to incredible effect.  There are some definite rough spots in tracks like \\"Creative Captivity\\", (do I hear a xylophone? Steel drums? What the hell is that?) and only the sung line 'Hear the Angels sing', in \\"Beauty in Tragedy\\" is just a little hollow sounding and not delivered that well. In every other case, this album is tight.  An experimental lean is apparent throughout the album and really works to the band's benefit.  While an album like Constellations is awesome in it's own right as it's the traditional metalcore sound perfected, this album like Leveler seek to take their particular sound further than the scope of their earlier records. Their ambition traces and dabbles in some middle eastern sounding riffing as well some 80's hair leads, both later in the album, as well as a host of other instruments mostly concentrated on a few tracks. Their heavy stuff is damn near Tech Death at points where they are just shredding these incredibly layered and melodic tracks on top of change-up driven rhythms. There is no denying that most of this is pulled off as only virtuoso musicians could. There are some minor hiccups beyond the ones I mentioned, but nothing to detract from overall excellent songs. The songs have a powerful individuality that lets you actually remember and distinguish them from one another. However consumed as an album all it's different moods and tones create an excellent experience. This already accomplished crew has their sights set high. Like real high. I mean, what's higher than heaven?me minor hiccups beyond the ones I mentioned, but nothing to detract from overall excellent songs.

B0035XVVDY|5.0|My college Mid-Terms are right around the corner and I had to chose a movie from a list to write about. Right now I am taking a Sociology class in college. My teacher gave all of the students a list of movies that she approved to choose from and then write about the movie. I chose Law Abiding Citizen because it is the kind of movie that I like. I love action movies and TV shows. I enjoy watching movies and shows like this because of how our society is. When I watch movies or shows I think about how some of the things done on the show are similar to what happens in everyday life. Everyone know that Movies and TV are fiction, but if you think about our society today, some of the things you see actually happen in everyday life. That is Reality versus Fiction. Think about one and the other and see how they compare. I really enjoyed this movie. I would recommend to anyone who likes action movies to buy the movie. I think you will love it.

B006362ZR6|5.0|Scars & Stories is the best album The Fray has released yet. Every song is a unique gem and each provides a different emotion which is a quality most albums from other bands these days struggle with. The pure, original sound of this band is legendary, and it is only going to get better in the future with their next album coming out soon. But hands down, this is a must have album for anyone who enjoys true, pure, beautiful music with great stories and tunes that will make you feel as happy as you did the first time you heard them with each listen. This will be forever among my favorites, I can't wait to get it on vinyl next.

With that said, however, despite having heard a multitude of people RAVING about John Green and Paper Towns in particular I don't see what the thrill is all about!<br /><br />I didn't realize until later that this book was directed towards young adults, but even still, I found the book to be childish, slow, monotonous, and I don't think it did a great job of catching my attention.<br /><br />I have heard that his others books are better, so I am going to give another one a try.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is an easy to play old fashioned space shooter. It gets gradually tougher as you go.  There are some fun power ups including a 3D mode.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have the first 2 seasons and enjoyed them . So glad to have the 3rd and now are waiting for the 4th. Hope there are more to come.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I think the is and excellent album. In This Moment is capable of sounding like Manson, Gaga, Otep and Terminal Choice all at the same time,
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|First off, Sylvia I love your work! I love this installment of the crossfire series. I love Gideon and Eva's story. I am so sick of people saying you took the 50shades story line and put a different spin on it people need to realize both Bared to You and Fifty shades of Grey were published on the same day, HEAVEN FORBID two authors write similar story lines because that never happens?!?!?! GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSES people, if you dont like what she is putting out there then dont pick it up! Sorry had to get that out, back to the book. OMG OMG OMG I love it! I am so GLAD you are making it more than a trilogy! I love that i get to look forward to another book about them! I can say i am SICk or Corinne and Brett being in the way, as head strong as Gideon and Eva read to be, the should have told them off by now!  THE ENDING KILLED ME, i was like flip to next page and WHAT!!!!??? Way to leave us hanging Sylvia!!!! GIVE ME MORE GIDEON AND EVA SOOOOOOOOOON PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|The second book was even beter than the frist one and I cant wait to start with the Third one ASAP, zo hopefully Brandt Legg Will be publishing it soon...<br />The books have definitely started my own soul searching and I am certain That we all have the powers of the soul described in here...
0307352153|5.0|What I love is the idea of not having to apologize for being an introvert. Finally. That is who I am. I love solitude. I love projects I can do alone. I feel proud of who I am and what I have accomplished. Every time I try to function outside of my nature, I feel so anxious and ill at ease. That doesn't mean I hate people or I am not empathetic or generous. That doesn't mean I am not emotionally attached to others. It just means I am happiest being who I am, a quiet person.  This book explains and celebrates the introvert. No, potential interviewer, I am not a team player. I have never been on a team. I don't care for team sports. I detest cooperative learning groups. Yet, I can do a wonderful job for you if you leave me alone. Let the quiet unite. Read this book.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I think I'd still stick with 2. Ok, I've never read the book. From the movie, I'm pretty sure I'm going to keep it that way. But I like movies and fantasy and I watch MANY movies so I run out of good ones I have not seen. So I was bored and thought I'd rent it anyways. Meh.<br /><br />The development of the 2 main characters' relationship seemed almost nonexistent. Suddenly, they are in love. Going to end this review and say I think this movie is for 14 year old girls who also liked twilight.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is better than temple run because in temple run you have less characters.It is really really pretty awesome.
B005721W9O|5.0|I'd seen this movie before and rented it again for an evening of enjoyment. If you are a sci fi nerd, there is nothing about this movie that's not fun. It's a good quality spoof on scifi tv shows and the things that are hokey are meant to be. Decent effects for the time it was made as well.<br /><br />Never seen it? Rent it, get some snacks and drinks and have a good time. If you are not a sci fi nerd, why are you even looking at this?
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|When i first heard Jack Bugg on the radio i thought it was an older artist, like Dylan or similar. All the songs have that same feel to them but Jake is 19 (I think).  if you like the sound of lightning Bolt, you'll like the album.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|At least a good original horror movie. I find it hard to review this without spoiling the movie. Here goes. Solid acting, good story and production values. Superb directing. I like how this movie creates some creepy scenes, but then reveals the truth behind them. I did have a slight problem with the premise of the story though. Why does mama have to be what she is? The movie is solid but I think they went the easy way and they could have made her into something else.<br /><br />Regardless, If you are a horror fan, you will enjoy this movie.
B00APYKXFS|3.0|The music is bland,  the graphics are pretty enough,  but for an actual bullet hell style game it's pretty blah.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|i liked the game alot better untill the update. sure the daily homework was a nice idea and all but it just wasnt as interesting as nemo learning all about the reef and the contribution of ideas from dori and marlin.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|I have always been a reader of the last page at the beginning, and a skip forward to see what was happening before it is to be revealed. With my kindle, I could do neither, so was absorbed into the story as it unfolded.  This is the third book I have read by Kate Morton and I think it is my favorite.
B00942S4OY|5.0|This cd arrived in good condition..very fast shipping ! My daughter loved it she said it was her favorite birthday present. I think its a great cd for tweens & teens to listen to up to date boy band I even enjoy the music !
1452115567|5.0|I had seen bits and pieces of this work but oh my...the collection will make you want to grab your pup and camera and travel...or just simply enjoy this beautiful animal on &#34;things&#34; from your armchair!
B0036UMM84|1.0|The cd arrived in good time and looks very good. I put it in my tv player and started it. It did not even play through but stopped and would not restart. I started it again and it did the same thing in the same place on the cd. I am very unsatisfied with this cd. Thanks for the chance to voice this.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Indy on Blue Ray. I have these on VHS and DVD. So why not on blue ray. Nothing like a good old fashion adventure.
1577314808|5.0|It was very good reading and was well written about a subject that should be seen by many people. My wife is reading it now but very slowly.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a very good game, but falls just short of being a great game. For some reason, it fails to respond to some of the finger inputs. This is not consistent, but does tend to be frustrating. Other than that, the game has great graphics and the challenging and constantly varying routes make it addictive.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|I thought I had ordered a CD and was thinking of returning it, but decided to watch it (for the 100th time).  What an entertainer she is, great video!!
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Was anticipating this albums release, since I first heard it on satellite radio.....fits right in withpreviously released material from this band
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very addicting and challenging....love the pieces to go together to get to the rest of the puzzle.job well done.....holds my interest
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app  I use it all the time a ND it says. Read sent and delivered its awesome now I could communicate  with FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!:):)
B00C4YZ12C|2.0|I enjoy the game, but don't understand why it keeps needing to check/log on to play.  Can't play if your in airplane mode.
1594488886|5.0|Lives destroyed under the thumb of power - the power of money, an antiquated social system  or guns and rockets. Mariam, born out of wedlock, is condemned to a life at the lowest stratum, treated like dirt. Leila, born into aspiring middle class, might have a life of happiness and great promise. This ends in the crossfire of Afghanistan's warlords. In their struggle for power homes and lives are turned into rubble.<br />Leila ends up next to Mariam as second wife to Rashee. Malicious and violent he drags their lives into debasement and brutality. This domestic violence mirrors Afghanistan's destruction by warring sections and the Taliban.<br />Yet, amid destruction hope remains, the knowledge of something better, of a thousand splendid suns. And a love strong enough to give your own life<br />The lack of artfulness gives this book an excruciating honesty. I was sometimes overpowered and had to interrupt reading. It's the type of book you finish with the intention to change your life.<br />Excellent!
1781162646|5.0|I love Mr. King's work and this lived up to all the others.  Not scary by any means; just really good story telling.
161655164X|5.0|I love this art book! But be warned there are spoilers in here so play the game before looking at it!
B00APYKXFS|3.0|I don't really understand why so many people are rating low based on the ships being the same color it doesn't matter at all if you really can't keep track of your ship I don't really know what to say... That being said there isn't a lot of content to this game it's a very basic quick front scrolling shooter that doesn't seem to stand out in any way.
B003V1WXKU|4.0|This guy had an amazing life. I am glad to have learned more about him. A great read for anyone who loves science.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very fun game. i played it for hours. i love a challenge.  hoping to play more before the night is over
0596806027|3.0|Read the book cover-to-cover and never once did I feel that there was any organization or theme to the book
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|I was so excited to share this with my kids now that they are old enough. It was a good now as when I saw it in the theaters years back!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love this spider solitaire better than any others I have had. But, I would pay for a version with no adds. I hope you make that available. I like to play without having to cancel the add each time.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved The Hunger Games movie.  So fun to watch on Kindle Fire!  The book trilogy is wonderful, too.<br />Can't wait for the next movie!
1439153663|5.0|I checked the libraries and realised that this book had quite a long waiting list. I was very happy to purchase it from you. It came promptly and I was able to enjoy reading it as it was in great shape . Thank you
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed &#34;Searching for Sugar Man.&#34; What an incredible story. His impact on South Africa is amazing. Likewise the films from 1998 that provided some of the content, made Sixto Rodriguez look good: 'kind of a Buddha&#34; was how one of my friends described him. The exposure he got through this documentary has revitalized his career and given him a new lease on life. Now he's everywhere- just did 5 days of sold-out concerts in Paris and London and did a couple of performances in Michigan. Cool dude. I am happy for him and find his story inspiring.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie. I wanted to get a copy of it so when she comes over we can watch it together. Thanks for your fast shipping and low price
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My kids and I love trying to solve the puzzles together.  Great family fun together. We love to try and see who can figure out the clue first.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Clever puzzles. Just hard enough to be challenging but not so hard as to be frustrating.<br />I recommend this game.
B002QE3CTY|1.0|Like a mix of The Hunger Games and Capricorn 1. It was slow to start. The middle action was enough to carry through. However, the end, like a daytime soap opera was more about leaving you with tomorrows cliff hanger, than completing a story line. Sequels are great, but not when they're the objective. I felt a little cheated.
1400064287|4.0|Needed for a Professional communications class. Great stories would recommened to read before creating new products or ideas. Good book.
B003L1ZWG2|4.0|When I heard the premise for this I'm like &#34;How can you make a movie about people getting stuck on skilift? People don't just get stuck up on one in the middle of the night.&#34; Well appearently they do when they're college kids and the people in charge of operating the lift aren't so great at their job.<br /><br />After that it's another movie with a small cast and mostly takes place in the same location. The characters are mildly interesting, but it's the athmosphere that really hooks the viewer to this film. The desperation of the cast and the odds against surviving the film are what truely holds the viewer to the movie.<br /><br />There's not much more to mention other then, don't watch the trailer closely, if you do, you'll be able to peice together a lot of what happens in the movie. Thankfully I didn't watch it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and intend to read the entire quartet. It was very well written and enjoyable. I'm intrigued for the movie now.
B001CTDH76|4.0|a silly show, this makes spending time at home when it is rainy and dreary outside - more fun... was surprised how many i had seen in reruns - and then also surprised how many I had missed...
B007TNS6JI|5.0|So addicting cant stop playing this game one of the bezt tablet rpgs out there!!!!!! Wishing had more customization like a pet companion maybe
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Good price for what i wanted and needed.Fits good and would buy again.It had the right length for what I needed as well.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|It's great! It is very addicting :) it has good characters . I just wish that more hero's would be available for free. Plus the ones you buy aren't very good.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|The was challenging and made me think, however what was the point? I feel like I just solved a bunch of puzzles that had no real point. At least with Nancy Drew games I understood what the end result should look like.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I highly recommend this app.get it free today.This awesome. I'm taking with me to a lake like I did last year
B005JCT4B0|5.0|It was a great deal of a band that put heavy metal on the map! It took me back to a time when all that was important was havin a hell of a time!
B0014JKJJI|2.0|I have had the shoes just over 2 months and only wear inside the house. The rubber sole is coming off already.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It give my girls a little bit of responsibty of taking care of an animal<br />My girls like the horse app
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|If you like Nat King Cole and George Benson with some excellent guest artists, this is a perfect, perfect album.  Really enjoyed the style of the Nat King Cole replays.  You can't go wrong on this album.  I have played it over and over and over.
B003MC5N28|4.0|For some reason this book stuck out to me in middle school and now as an adult I wanted to read it again, forgot how short it was but its a great read.
B002KKCVY6|5.0|Even my husband likes them, and he hates sandles.  Fit is true to size.  We would highly recommend this product.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|We had heard a lot of good reviews for the series. Couldn't get on Netflix. We enjoyed every CD. Kept us interested throughout. I would highly recommend watching if you enjoy deception, politics and hunt for terrorists
0425264351|2.0|This was the third or fourth Jack Reacher novel that I have read. Had it been the first, there never would have been a second. Jack Reacher's character is never what you might call \\"believable\\", but in this book, it was just one head shaking moment after the other.  I truly just wanted this book to end.<br /><br />This was the second Reacher book that I had read with a small southern town setting. Having lived in the South all of my life, it would be difficult for any author who had lived in another country to accurately portray Southern life in a convincing way, but Child's efforts are just ridiculous. The vernacular, the settings, and the lack of any idea how small towns in the south work is just impossible to get beyond. The one example that just glares at me is the character stopping a cop in Atlanta to ask for the \\"commercial district\\". Really?  And the whole scene at the airport is just bizarre and totally unbelievable. And what's a \\"forecourt\\"?  Or magnolia scrub? That is not a word I have ever heard used anywhere in the US, let alone the South. Mr. Child really should have visited a small town in Georgia before writing this book.<br /><br />But worse are the holes in the plot that one of the trucks carrying cash could drive through. To think that this many federal agents and locals alike could be killed without the area crawling with the feds is just bizarre. And the Sunday denouement is laughable. This is just a really bad book. And Reacher's character is much more annoying in first person.<br /><br />Thankfully, Lee Child gets more comfortable with his Reacher character in later books. With this one, I just wish I had my money back.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love that it challenges me and forces me to think. It's hard but yet not impossible to solve these levels, it makes you feel stupid once you figure them out but at the same time you feel like a genius because you passed them! Can't wait for the new levels...
B008L40Q7E|3.0|I never saw the movie version of this.  Anyway, not bad... this is the third Bond novel I've read, and this one is getting a bit closer to the over-the-top caricatures and clichés that the movies are famous for, down to the supervillain who, rather than kill Bond outright, tells him everything in minute detail, and then has a long and convoluted scheme to kill him... and then doesn't bother to watch to see if he dies.  Sorry if that's a spoiler.  Anyway, maybe this wasn't a cliché back in 1956, and maybe it was this book and subsequent movie that helped establish the cliché in the first place.<br /><br />This book is also chock-full of racial stereotypes and derogatory terms which were probably taken for granted back then, but not so well appreciated today.  And not just the bad guys calling Bond \\"Limey\\".  I was also a bit uncomfortable with the love interest in this story - the depiction of \\"Honey\\" is both world-wise and childlike at the same time, and Bond's desire for her was a bit creepy given some of the childlike descriptions.<br /><br />Despite the flaws - overall not a bad read.  Once again (as in the other novels, but not the movies) Bond is not always so sure of himself, not always cool under fire, and sometimes makes mistakes.  Which makes him a more interesting hero.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It is so much fun. You can customize your person. its really easy to get coins to but things. if i were you i would get the app.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|You know, it's getting pretty easy to figure out what to watch.<br /><br />It goes something like this:<br /><br />Sequel--> Yes/ No<br /><br />If yes --> which director?<br /><br />If no --> which director?<br /><br />Why they handed this illustrious serious to such a d-grade director, it's anyone's guess. It's really critical to understand how this movie went wrong, really most if not all of the blame lies with Dir. John Moore.<br /><br />Let's just say that John McClane was not a character in this movie. The guns were not even a character in this movie. I think there was some broken glass, if that helps make anyone feel better. I think the only thing that comes out of this movie better for the wear is mercedes, that G-wagon must be made of some kind of carbon fiber titanium ceramic let's take out a second mortgage MRAP.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|i hate this game it is so boring and frustrating. it is super hard to move the hair where you want it so u can cut it. you have to upgrade (which costs money) to get more hair accesories and color choices. if i were you i wouldnt get the game.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|After reading all the negative reviews I was on the fence about buying this book, but I am so glad I got it. This book had me from the first page till the end. Only complaint I have is the fact we have to wait so long for the next one.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game it a liot of fun, it can be very addicting. the further you go in the game the harder it gets. if i were you i would get the app.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Liked the Cd, the case was cracked but arrived prior to the date promised. The CD was in good shape and enjoy the music
B000LTAY1U|5.0|So I've had this watch for about a month.  I was going to get a Seiko Kinetic but I thought I'd first try out a less expensive self-winding watch. Like most people have said, it runs a little fast but I adjust it once a month so that is no big deal.  I wear it all the time and often I just like to look at the movement.  For every second, it ticks three or four times instead of just once.  It is handsome but in an understated fashion.  It doesn't sparkle or look it was meant to survive armageddon.  I hope it just quietly continues to work for a long time and I'd be happy with that.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This seris not only makes you want to turn every page and never put it down, it also makes you find yourself...or the person you want to be in one of the characters!  Favorite part of this 3rd installment...that there will be more!!!! :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the best weather app I have found, the name says it all. It has everything needed to keep up to date on weather.
B00466HM28|5.0|I bought a Mac desktop and logic pro which cost me about 1,700 bucks.  I was tapped out after and this was the Midi keyboard I used for my initial setup.  Its nothing fancy but it was perfect for my introduction to electronic music.  Pads are a little stiff but they break in with a good pounding.  Considering the price tag I would say it is definitely worth it.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|My wife actually likes this more than I do, and it's in her car.  I've also got the DVD and it's worth getting.  Buy them both!!!
1451627297|5.0|I don't write many reviews but I felt this book was fantastic!  Great blend of historical significance with the King style that I love.  It is worth the time it takes to read a book of this size.  Bravo Mr. King, bravo.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I've just been introduced (via music and guitar mags) to Bonamassa.  He's into the blues,and I like that.  Great if you like the blues.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love how this show continues to stay relevant and avoid being trite and banal after the second season. It manages to sucessfuly weave in complex plots while staying grounded as well. I've loved this show from day one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Although this game is 6.99, which is more than I generally will pay for an app, this was certainly worth the money. The controls are decent, and the interface with the worlds is very good. Survival mode is great if you like more of a challenge, and want to deal with monsters like creepers, skeletons, etc. Creative mode is great if you just want to build the coolest buildings you can because you have unlimited supplies. My only complaint is that many of the worlds are smaller than the ones I have played on the free PC version, but they are still dynamic and enjoyable to work with. If you are sitting on the fence about whether or not to get this app, I say you should buy it.
B00821OX98|4.0|It's not bad but if you've seen one of these SciFi Aliens-take-over-earth-then-a-ragtag-group-battles-for-human-survival, you've seen them all. I watched one episode, it wasn't bad but it wasn't enough to grip me.
1843104954|5.0|I am a clinical psychotherapist. This helped me and I've bought copies for my clients.  Very readable and useful. Thank-you for this resource.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a good similar game play to shine runner on water. Very addicting and foolproof to have fun over and over.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Great picture quality, graphics, storyline; a movie to be watched over and over again and never tire of.  Had to have it for my small, worthy movie collection!
0545265355|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I loved how they changed up and kept me guessing. An unexpected ending to say the least. I really enjoyed it.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Oh what a wonderful,wonderful story. I love a story that blocks out today's reality and let's you disappear In to the story just as if you are a part of it. Doesn't happen often. Only discovered the wonderful Kate because I read an article a magazine had done on her, a fellow Queenslander. Thank you Miss Kate, all your stories have been wonderful and made me enjoying reading as I enjoyed it as a child reading Enid Blyton and Tolkein. Highly recommended reading very enjoyable.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher is one of my newest discoveries.  Although I watched the movie &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; on my PPV and was entertained, do not begin to judge this novel by the movie.  The beginning moved somewhat slowly, but the groundwork was being laid for what came afterward.  I enjoyed this first novel of the series, and have every intention of reading the next one, and next one, and next one!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I first played it on Facebook. Haven't had any problems from the moment I downloaded about a year ago. Very addicting but fun. I also like being able too play when I am not online.
B002SZQC7A|5.0|I just love Dr Who and having these at my finger tips is incredible.  I just love it. Totally love it
0062238310|5.0|I am totally hooked on Downton Abbey!  This special book helped me with the &#34;English&#34; manner of speaking.  The script is right there in front of you to read with ease.  One thing for certain, they don't speak &#34;Texan&#34; over there!  : )  I will be buying the other &#34;script&#34; books as they are available.
B00DBSZ6ZC|4.0|I liked this version of the old Grimm fairy tale.  It was a bit soft on character development.  I felt like I had been dumped into the middle of the movie.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|A co-worker recommended this app, and it has being one of the most handy applications I know, especially the 'to do list' since I have this app I'm not longer need to have a piece of paper with me that I always forget.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|If there was, this would be a 5. Sealed play is fantastic. Please add online play and I will love this
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This is a good move so I purchased it to watch.  It eventually came out on Netflix for free so I watched it again.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|This is a great value in auto watches. If you're looking for it you probably know most of the specs and comparative models. Mine has been pretty accurate so far. It consistently runs 5-6 seconds fast each day, which is pretty good for this price range.  My only complaint is the end links on the jubilee bracelet are hollow and very cheap feeling. It's not a big deal though because there are lots of aftermarket bands that this watch looks great on. Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for high quality, durable, daily wear diver watch.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Outstanding series, but sad ending. A season six would be in order to continue developing the characters. Merlin and Arthur were at a deciding point in their lives.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|I have loved this film since the first time that I saw it. This was a &#34;must buy&#34;! Great cast, great director, great script, great music - the whole caboodle! Love the behind the scenes extras!
B00APYKXFS|2.0|Nothing special move on. It's very hard and hard to see what's going on the screen. Thank god it was free.
B000001E3V|4.0|Recorded and released after Duane's death, his guitar is sorely missed on this live version of the Dominoe's. Great album though, and Duane's absence is the only missing star.
0395925037|5.0|Hitler did some bad things but as a political figure he was one interesting and amazing guy. This book is an eye opener. It really helps you appreciate just how visionary he was seeing and carrying out his own future, and writing it out before hand. He doesn't write like some stark, boring politician. His writing is full of passion and artistry, and you really get a personal feel for his background, and views. Everything he writes down has so much meaning to him and you can really feel that. I was impressed. Given the right background and historical setting, I can image how this book was inspiring to many german people. In terms of staunch individuality, he makes a great political figure, he has views and he doesn't care how radical they are, he believed in and carried out everything he promised in this book. It's too bad we don't have politicians like this anymore.
1892005034|5.0|The author writes clearly and uses examples to get ideas across. It is an easy read that you will re-reference and share with others.  The concept of NVC is an easy four step system that has so much more behind it but once you understand you will want to practice it daily!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Very entertaining.  My daughter asks to watch it at least once a day.  We've added this movie into her &#34;Good Behavior Reward System&#34;
B00847KFDS|5.0|If you love CCR and John Fogarty, you'll love these collaborations.  I especially appreciate that John and company (who include many of the best artists in music today) were not just content to do straight covers, but reinterpretations of some of John's best songs.  Very well done, John et al !!!
1451695195|5.0|Being from the medical profession myself, this book provided me validation of my own perceptions. I have worked with hospice and this serves as a great pool of resource.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|First, you need to know that Mr. Phillips is my all-time favorite Idol winner.  That being said, this album is an excellent &#34;coming-out&#34; for the talented young artist.  (And I mean artist.)  Yes, some of the songs are very similar in style and substance to others on the album, but it's still a great listen.  I expect even greater things in the future from this one-of-a-kind talent.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Keeps you wanting to read more...wish we would be able to read the novels that Stieg had envisioned for the series.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This game is interesting and makes the gameplay feel like real detective work. For me, this is on par with Portal, albeit a minigame form. But for 99&cent; this game makes the generic shooters that rule half the games industry look like a child with a bag of plastic soldiers designed them. Puzzles and mystery run rampant. Twisted Lands Shadow Town is an excellent game and I want many more like it.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|It's worth the money and it's charge fast it will be better if its has iPhone 5 input I recommend it for any one needs to charge a lot<br />Don't think twice place your order now.
B000004286|5.0|I liked listening to this more while watching he movie and not so much on cd. The music is good and it gets me moving.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun sometimes hard to click on items.  Challenging and entertaining way to spend an afternoon at the airport. Plus its free.
0783233477|5.0|Quick delivery. I actually sent this as a gift for Father's Day. It is my understanding that it was well received. Thanks.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Amazing movie. the soundtrack and snowboarding pair perfectly together. I have watched it many times and still enjoy watching them shred the mountains!! gets me pumped for snowboarding.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I downloaded Angry Birds Friends not realizing it was an online group play game via Facebook. I do not like playing games via Facebook and I choose not to share my game playing information with the world. After going through the tutorial, I immediately removed it from my device. It may be great for some people, but I'll stick with the other versions of Angry Birds on my Kindle Fire.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Another that was hard to put down.  Kept  my intrest from start to finish.  Cant wait to read the next book.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I'm so happy that amazon is selling this game. It won't show up on the google play store on my phone. It works perfectly on the Note 2. I always wanted this game on the go, and now I can play it any time I want. Just be careful, it drains your battery QUICK!
1439181780|5.0|Many people have wishful thinking and literal interpretation embedded so deeply into their psyche (can simply reading this book literally transform my life right now?) that they seem to be unable to take the realistic conceptual positives from a book such as the Power. For example, simply because the Power omits or de-emphasizes action does not mean it discourages it. Quite the opposite, I believe the book was written for those who have no trouble translating thoughts into action. In fact, everyone should have no such trouble, if one's belief system and \\"feelings\\" as the author puts it, are strong and positive enough. If you truly have an incredible positive feeling every minute, every second, if you truly can enjoy and appreciate and be thankful for every thing around you most of the time (51% of the time), then you can't help but spring into action; you can't help but do something positive; you can't help but work hard. In fact, working hard won't feel like working hard. It would feel like engaging in your favorite activity. That is the point.<br /><br />Many people seem to have a deep belief that nothing good can come out of enjoyable activities; that everything worthy must come out of hardship and toil. I completely reject that notion. My entire life has been the opposite: the only times I have made significant leaps in my skill level, knowledge, and my social standing is when I made the conscious decision to enjoy everything I do. Those are the periods where I made the most progress in life. And the periods where I made no progress or negative progress are those times when I didn't enjoy what I was doing; when I considered hard work as a necessary thing to make progress.<br /><br />There is also a deep-seated fear in Western culture that sitting still or inaction is a bad thing. In Eastern culture there is no such stigma, and hence a lot of people are receptive to the idea of meditation. In fact, in Eastern culture, many teachings emphasize not a lot of actionor constant action, but carefully chosen correct action; for example, the martial arts do not teach one to flail around hoping to win, but to concentrate, minimize action, minimize wasted effort, and only move in and take action when the time and opportunity is right. Or another example is speaking: in Eastern culture, constantly chattering about your thoughts is considered a waste; rather people respect those who speak sparingly but correctly most of the time. Economy of action is considered the critical skill. Meditation is also practiced for that purpose: if one meditates enough, one will have prepared a clear focused mind free of turbulence, such that when action becomes necessary, it will be the correct action.<br /><br />All of these so-called laws are self-evident and obvious to most people. However, the point of this book is not to communicate simply these facts. It is to make people realize the degree to which this is true and important. It is similar to knowledge that people have regarding smoking or dieting. Most people know what they need to do, but still are not able to do them. It is the difference between cognitive understanding, and a deeper level subconscious understanding. It is the difference between talking about something, and actually creating a set of habits that implement the ideas. What the author is aiming to do is to present these self-evident concepts in a way that may penetrate beyond your conscious guard and be implanted in your subconscious mind (hence the music, sound effects, etc). Once there, you will automatically start to create habits that are naturally positive. And once that happens, there will be changes in your life, simply from the laws of statistics: the number of times you will do something positive will be much much larger each day, and the probability of something good happening in response will start to grow and become much larger. When this is compounded daily, over many years, then the difference can truly be staggering. To me, this is not mysticism, this is pure and simple statistical mechanics.<br /><br />Now finally regarding this idea of just acting as if you already have something and your desires will manifest: I believe that this can be explained mostly by the concept of human attention. Most of us are so caught up in our anxieties and worries, that we are letting hundreds of opportunities pass by us without our notice. We live this way for many many years, until we are completely convinced that there simply are not many good opportunities out there. However, if we only were able to pay more attention to our surroundings, then we will realize that those opportunities do exist and are there for you to receive them. When one acts as if one already has the object of desire, one's mind becomes calmer but more importantly becomes tuned to seeing all things pertaining to that object. Therefore, when those opportunities do occur (since they are actually always occurring, except you never noticed them before), you will now recognize them. And if you have been practicing good feelings, you will feel no barriers to take action and pursue those opportunities.<br /><br />In fact this phenomenon involves a little more than simple attention. When we act as if we have what we want, our mind becomes calmer and happier. When that happens, our interactions with other people (such as prospective employers) become more confident and positive. We will leave a much better impression than if we were unhappy, insecure, and desperate. Hence we will likely get the job offer.<br /><br />Or back to objects of desire, acting as if we have the object not only tunes are attention to those things related to our objects of our desire, it will also open our mind up creatively about completely different ways to achieve our desire. Once that happens, an opportunity that we might have passed by before because it seemed unrelated to our desire will suddenly look like an obvious opportunity to pursue, becausenow you will clearly see the connection between that opportunity and your desire. In other words, if you are able to calm down your mind, stop being negative, and pay close attention to your surroundings, you will see that seemingly unrelated opportunities can be transformed to give you exactly what you want. I believe this is the true Power of this book and its message.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Very well written action thriller. About the time things are beginning to clear up, a new twist comes up and you are off on a new turn.  A fun and fast paced read.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have loved everyone one of his books thus far and this one does not disappoint. The twists and surprises still get me.  Excellent story telling and great characters. I can't wait tip the next book is done,
B009AMANBA|3.0|The movie as a whole did not meet my expectations. The production did not float my boat and at times I was bored except for Daniel Day Lewis' performance.
B007VTUYWW|3.0|Well. You have the eye candy that is LarA Croft. Nothing says tomb raiding like jiggling in a tight outfit. Story line is good. Acting..... eh. Good film to relax and not use your brain for a bit.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Five Stars for sure.<br />very well designs. looking forward for playing more.  strongly recommended game.<br />A game you want to play over and over.
B00CIS1OKW|5.0|I watched this movie with my son and after the movie he thought giants were real. That is how great the special effects were in this movie. We loved it!!
0529005298|5.0|loved this story and loved Tasha Tudor as an illustrator.  She has been my favorite since childhood.  Great service too.
B000W93CHC|5.0|The power of love, the love of power, intrigue, sex, and the strength and wisdom of the women, Caris, Gwenda, Mother Cecilia, Mair, Lady Phillipa, Madge Webber, made this a fascinating, entertaining read. I enjoyed learning more about the middle ages and could see where Shakespeare got so many of his strong female characters - they were all around him! Merthin is a man to cherish and dream along with as he builds his dream stone by stone. The description of the battle of Crecy was heart pounding. Recommended to anyone who enjoys a good, fast paced, historic drama.
B005IS565S|5.0|gift for my boyfriend he loves it said it is his fav he can't wait for the next one that I buy for him lol
B001BR5NN0|5.0|American Classic! Can't believe I waited this long to see it for the first time. I would recommend it to anyone
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is a GREAT fast paced arcade style game. The controls are simple and the game continues to be challenging no matter how many times I've played it. Loved it..
B004WMKXWM|4.0|Action packed, but fun for the whole family. Contemplating reading the books if they are even better than the movies.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Since watching the Avengers was backtracking through all the various related movies. This was definitely the best of all those I've seen and my husband enjoyed it  - a popcorn evening of fun.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|I really enjoyed the game.  It's something that I start up if I want something to play for a few minutes and also the soundtrack is pretty great.  The characters make me  laugh.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|This is a great album with all of the Number One hits by Michael Jackson worth having.  It is truly a buy-one-album CD.  I liked being able to download the songs right away, then have the CD trail along in the mail.  That is a super service, not outdone by anyone else to my knowledge.  Having the CD means you'll have your hits in the long run, through computer blow-ups and etc.  I like that.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved this movie, great actors, lots of action and that it ties into all the other movies I have watched.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|My son and I like the movie.  It was a good take on the fair tale.  Fun to watch and a good story.
B00AALX5SI|1.0|Not worth your time or effort to watch. Music was good but the behind look at her shows was kinda of stupid.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great way to find cooking and creating ideas, easy to use, lots of fun to find useful ideas for the house and body
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the way you can layer your own sounds.  I have a sleep machine but this has sounds that are more seamless.  You aren't subconsciously waiting for the sound loop.  I use it almost every night.
B001CDWFPC|1.0|I was unable to open this Bible or move about in it. Therefore, I deleted it and I expect to receive a refund.It's very hard to rate something you can't read.<br />Thank you,<br />Barbara Scott
B0084IG8TM|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I'd seen it in the theater and wanted to own it on DVD. The quality is great. Thank you.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The court cases in each episode grab you, and the ongoing storylines keep you coming back. This courtroom drama mixed with witty and engaging charcters is very entertaining.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I bought it for my dad ... he's an awesome archer. He was very happy with it's quality. Thank you very much.
B0086213XW|1.0|I never write reviews, but this movie was wrong on so many levels that I felt compelled. For all those who found this movie insightful or moving I feel sorry for you. Apparently your lives must be even more boring and meaningless than those of the characters in this totally empty film. Live a few more years then check your 4 or 5 star rating at the door. Or at least I hope you will.<br /><br />In a nutshell, nothing in this movie feels like real life. No one is honest or open. Everyone is floating through a totally contrived WierdLand. A 28 yr old woman who never behaves for one moment like more than an 8 yr old. A lonely artist plying the rickshaw trade who imagines hot times with said married 8 yr old, who - sorry Michelle - doesn't have a hot bone in her body in this flick. And a chicken cooking husband who might want to be seduced if his wacko wife wasn't trying to seduce him while he's working over a hot stove or talking on the phone.<br /><br />Quirky as it was, Lou and Margot are only one serious conversation and fun date away from possibly rediscovering why they got married in the first place. Nothing in this movie makes any sense and the emotional motives of any of the characters are highly questionable.<br /><br />Seems that this movie was rambling from serious marriage analysis to desperate housewives fantasy to heated love affair...sadly not hitting any of those marks.<br /><br />Watch at your own risk, but like an earlier reviewer, I wanted to pull the plug at the halfway point but forced myself to push through a dozen more pointless moping scenes. The first thing I did when I finished watching this movie was to spin my old copy of The Big Chill to get the bad taste of \\"Margot's a Mess\\" out of my mouth.
B002VWNID6|5.0|I bought it for my dad ... he's an awesome archer. He was very happy with it's quality. Thank you very much.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|If you upgrade to the full version, you will find hundreds, if not thousands,  of hours of playtime. The A.I. proves challenging without being impossible to beat. Unlock new decks, titles, cards for your decks, and achievements, and artwork.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|The Okuda's and everyone involved with the restoration of TNG film is doing an excellent job. Finally we can see the correct colors of the uniforms, and everything on the bridge is in crisp detail. I love a lot of this season's episodes, including &#34;The Outrageous Okona&#34;, &#34;The Royale&#34;, &#34;Q Who&#34;, etc. Great season for anyone who loves TNG.
0061733199|4.0|The amount of information in this book is ridiculous.  My only complaint is how much info there is i guess, I will have to read it a couple times to be able to retain a decent amount. That sucks because it's about 600 pages. Good thing it comes with an index for easy location for any information in the book. Great for BOB.
0545265355|5.0|Katniss Everdeen is a normal girl in a future America gone astray. In this frightening future, survival, oppression, hunger, poverty, and disease are facts of life. But in this world, a teenager's greatest fear is being selected for the annual hunger games, games that determine which district gets enough grain to eat for the next year. There is only one winner in the hunger games, the one who kills off all of his or her opponents. This year, Katniss is in the games.<br /><br />I reluctantly read this series at the insistence of my daughter. I normally don't enjoy the latest pop culture novel. But I was wrong about Hunger Games Series. These novels are among the best I've ever read. There are so many nuances about our culture in the novels while making it so the reader never catches her breath. Every time I thought I had a handle on what would happen next, another plot twist threw me for a loop. These novels are the 1984 of our time. I highly recommend them. My only warning is to buy all three. You'll want to start the next novel as soon as you finish the first. I love this series!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I loved the book. There was a love of friends and family. You don't find the values talked of in the book much in the modern world.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|blue-ray on the 3d tv, this movie lloks great!!!perfect!my broterther's quest forthis movie on buray has ended.I was doubtuful it t was even realasedon blu-ray becuseNO ONE hadit!!
B00BI6SSMC|4.0|Fantastic lyrics.  This is work that you listen to and then the lyrics will hang in your mind and you find them coming up again during the day at the oddest times.  Very enjoyable.
B009C7JS14|5.0|love this weather apps, it's awesome. It gives you a detailed forecast of the week. Pity that the only way to possess a full access to apps you have to upgrade it.
B004GYY714|5.0|It is hard to find music on the radio for the 50's and 60's. This is a great app I can listen to the music of my generation with out bothering anyone else.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|This was much better than I thought it would be...the premise was iffy. But it was entertaining, colorful, and masterfully done. James Franco-who I love--was just OK for me in this...not enough Harold Hill in him, but he filled the boots.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|We own the original movie on VHS and just had to have the remake...  Great movie!!!  The DVD and case were both in great shape and we had no problems watching it...  Thanks.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Ok movie for a Saturday afternoon movie. Kind of silly. Maybe it's just me but between Arnold and Sylvester I don't know who is getting harder to understand.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|would not work on fire hd. If it will not work on my kindle why is it in my kindle offers?
B007STBUIW|5.0|Spielberg was in top form when he directed this 1975 action/thriller. One of the most perfect films I've ever seen. The casting is spot on, the acting is amazing and the pacing is perfect. If you've ever seen the mechanical shark at Universal Studios, you know how fake it looks. Spielberg shows just enough of it to scare, but not enough that you can see how awful it looks. There is also quite a bit of comic relief moments that are very funny.<br /><br />The remastering on the blu-ray is top notch. It looks just as good as it did when I saw it in the theater 40 years ago.
B001KX50BK|5.0|always a good movie.. wanted to add it to my collection of dvd/blu rays. had it on vhs and no longer can play those.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My kids, my husband and myself are all addicted to this game. We play together and take turns or help each other with a game they are playing on their device.
1587613379|5.0|I happened upon this book discreetly lying about in a good friend's library, almost as if she had hidden it just well enough for the casual observer to miss but obvious enough for the curious. And with such a provocative title, could one not be curious about this book?<br /><br />Preface: you must be open-minded to get the full benefit to this book. If a world where the word \\"slut\\" is not an insult, but a compliment, is inconceivable or impossibly distasteful, save your money.<br /><br />However, if you think sex can be a good thing, if the idea that heterosexual monogamy *isn't* the only option, then get this book (if you haven't read it already, of course). If I was asked what the most important books on sexuality would be for a library, this would be among them.<br /><br />Eaton & Hardy demystifying other relationship possibilities, taking the time to explain all the basics -- sex/gender aren't the same things, gender preference isn't a binary thing, and loving only a single other person forever isn't the only way. They present the various ways all of this fits together, and gave me a good understanding of the core concepts that underly sexual, romantic, and otherwise (for the Greek-knowning, erotic, filial, and agape) fulfilling relationships of all kinds. There's no magic here, but that's the beauty of it. Keep an open mind, defer your judgment, and *communicate*.<br /><br />They give a great discussion on jealous, how it fits in, and how to manage it. You'll be shocked to hear that the answer to that is *gasp* open & honest communication. ;)<br /><br />If nothing else, you'll finish reading and find yourself more knowledgeable about others you may meet (or already know, as it turned out I did), while still being all the more confident in yourself. Perhaps you'll try something new out. Maybe that experience will change your life; maybe it'll just be a fun story to tell at parties. And all this while making a commitment to mutual respect that makes the world a nicer, sexier place to live.icer, sexier place to live.
0439023521|5.0|The story of this book is nothing you have read before. I found this book pretty interesting, i loved it so much that i had to take it with me to class. Despite of being a short book, its a well developed story, and it catches your attention since you start reading the first page. I highly recommend this book if you like fiction and particular stories.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Really stunning book, and highly recommended. Hard to put into words without giving anything away, so best to just say &#34; curl up, read, and be enthralled&#34;.
B00987MQRQ|4.0|I thought this book was going to be the 'generic', it wasn't..  It creates pictures in your mind, really makes you think.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a real room escape game and it doesn't suck. I liked it a lot. I have been looking for a good RE for a while and all ive been able to find are those 100 floors type games. Not sayin those don't pass the time, they just aren't the O.G. room escape I had hoped they were. This one is. Just needs more levels.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging without going overboard. I don't get stuck like in other lock out games. some levels are too easy for me but are good for my kids
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I loved the interaction of all the characters and how they managed to pull off saving NYC, despite major egos and flaws in them.  I love action movies and this one has plenty to go around.
B0024DF9MU|5.0|This movie has a good cast and the storyline makes it a feel good movie. Definitely watch it as a way of lifting of your spirits.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the story of Downtown Abbey and all the characters involved. But will miss Matthew. The plots are great. the customs are marvelous, and the scenery wonderful. Love the show. Watch it all the time.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Absolutely outstanding!  There was such a flow of interrelationships between the well to do family<br />and their servants.  Each level could not exist without the other. They all had their own life encounters<br />that wove in and out of the story.  Can't wait for the fourth season.
0316017930|4.0|I got stuck reading this book to my husband on a recent road trip.  He had to read it for a class in school.  Because I wanted him to do the driving, I was stuck as the reader so his assignment could get done.  I am the type of person who dreads reading books, especially outloud to someone else.  The story has to really engage me or I do not have interest.  I was dreading this book.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was hooked after just reading the first few pages.  I highly recommend reading this book, it opens your mind to the possibilities of the world around you.  It will definitely make me think twice about turning down opportunities that are presented to me.  It's an interesting perspective to the world around us and how those who are most successful became so.<br /><br />So interesting.  Considering other books by this author as well :)<br /><br />Easy read... may be good for a high school student to read also.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|An outstanding movie that will be enjoyed over and over again.  Nothing but geniuses put<br />this movie together.  The young star, Sura Sharma, was brilliant.  I understand he spent a year<br />learning how to show 'fear'...since the animals on the boat were computer designed.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|I bought this movie because i seen befor, was please and decided that the movie would be a good one for my collection, thanks for movie tike this
B009AMANBA|5.0|Excellent portrayal of Lincoln and the times.  More movies like this should be made.  My son-in-law<br />is from Georgia and he didn't agree with some facts. (:
B00003CXFV|5.0|will watch this movie my whole life, Julia Roberts played a major role, should have receive many awards, thanks for a great movie
B00APYKXFS|3.0|This is a super fast paced game, not gonna lie about that. I definitely recommend that you read the info on this product description on Amazon. I got the gist of this game without reading it, though I found the info useful.<br /><br />Truthfully, this game reminds me of that old Asteroid game but the pace is like four times more. I didn't have too much problems with the speed even though I die within about fifteen seconds. However, this kind of gameplay isn't my kind of thing. There are different options that this game offers: like switching from shake to 2 hand, changing the music a bit, and control speed. However, I believe my kindle sound isn't working right, so I can't comment on the music right now.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good, fast paced game. However, it just isn't for me. This game definitely brings back memories on those really old games, though. If you enjoy the old games where you are shooting at enemy spaceships and don't mind the challenge of a fast gameplay, then I definitely recommend trying out this game.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I don't have fb and haven't played bubble witch before but it looked like fun.  It is fun but it is frustrating not being able to have a &quot;help&quot;  to find out how to win stars and potions.  I'll stay with it for a little while longer.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|It's an ok cd...George is a good artist.  His tribute to Nat is very nice, but I would have liked him to have song more of his famous songs that were very well know, but all and all it's a nice cd.. recommendable.
B0058SNIC6|5.0|They are really that comfortable. I can work all day in them and walk almost 2 mi. back home and my feet are still full of energy!!<br />I was skeptical because they are flats and I am walking on nyc streets but they exceeded my expectations for comfort. I don't feel the uneven paved streets in them. I have to order a FEW more pair. They are also cute and stylish. Much better looking than sneakers and you can get away with wearing them in the office.
B0053KWDES|1.0|this may appear to be decent and cheap.<br /><br />actually it is just a cheap portable amp. lots of flaws...<br /><br />not worth the money.
B004NSULHM|5.0|Repeat, repeat. That's all I do, especially in summer. Repeat play: King of Limbs. This is a wildly underrated cd. And odd perhaps for a Radiohead album, King of Limbs is quintessential summer music. As the long twilight lingers, I just hit replay again and again. Why? Because Limbs is concise, dense, melodic, fascinating, and damn near perfect.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|\\"Free-App-Of-The-Day\\" - - - What a Deal! Easy to correct mistakes/undesirable strokes or 'ditch it all' and start over. Even non-artists can create somewhat works-of-art while sitting around relaxing in front of the TV. Takes a bit of experimenting to understand what the different brush settings and Your strokes are going to produce on the canvas . . .
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I could not put this book down. As a mom, it tugged at my heart strings. As a human, it made me angry. Phenomenal storytelling!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|A great entertaining game. very addicting and the games are very original. tons of fun games to unlock and play LOVE IT
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the scariest game ever, you have to buy it! I love my game! I wish they would make a new one similar to this. I would buy it. Am waiting!!!!<br /><br />SLENDERMAN is one of the coolest game ever i wish they would make a new slenderman game just like this one
B007ZUTNF6|5.0|Quick service...book condition as described!  Thank You!  Very thought provoking.....Would recommend to a friend of like mind...Will reread after I get a better grasp of it.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This mp3 player has been working great right out of the box.  As others have said, the music sounds far better when the songs are of a higher quality.  I use an online paid site to get all my music & they are cd quality with this player!  The feature I love is being able to use a stick flash drive.  It really doesn't get any easier to load/remove music than that.  No more CDs for me!
0140067477|5.0|If you are &#34;into&#34; Tao, Zen and the like, you should love this little book. I do. One doesn't read it like a story, it is more a daily - dare I say &#34;spiritual&#34;, read? You have to read beyond the facial story and think a bit. But isn't that why we read, except for an occasional James Patterson?
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one of the very best series out there.  My husband the vet never tires of watching this collection.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|This movie is a &#34;must&#34; in anyone's movie collection.  The trio of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor couldn't be more perfect.  Great family entertainment.  A very good transfer to Blu-Ray.
B003VS0CXS|4.0|I am a performer and was engaged in a successful show in Hollywood, when this film had its premiere, so I have happy moments of attending its first showing. My feeling then and now, are pretty much the same : Well made, charming, funny, way over the top in spots; but also extremely derivative, particularly of MARY POPPINS, even in many of the numbers and lots of the songs.Based on a novel by Ian Fleming(yes, the James Bond author), it lacks 'Poppins&#34; spunk, spirit and creativity. but, it, fortunately has Dick van Dyke and the lovely,&#34;road company Julie Andrews&#34;, Sally Anne Howes.<br />My granddaughters, 6,7 and 9 loved it, but even they said, &#34;Its a lot like Mary Poppins&#34;. But there are a lot worse films you could show your kids and even though it gets very long and repetitious in spots, you might enjoy it,too.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|For free it's worth a few minutes of play. But it definitely isn't worth paying for.  It looks like a game designers first rough draft that they weren't all that interested in building to begin with.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|I don't quite understand why the star average of UA is only 4 stars and the preceding and following recordings get 4.5 stars???!!! This album has good killer riffs and some serious shredding and about all are mid-tempo to fast. It's too bad that for guitar solos they can't do it tunefully like IRON MAIDEN or BLACK SABBATH but instead it's just a lot of shredding but that's just something you have to get used to. I think this is the best offering they've had since about YOUTHANASIA (that's a good bit of time). None of the songs are overly long (everything is under 6:00) which is pretty nice (I like long songs by some bands but not really from this band)!!! I think that this one may be 3rd place in their entire discography behind COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION and YOUTHANASIA but it could eventually be my second favorite after CTE. I'm not really sure why this only has a 4 star average when it should be at least a 4.5!!!! I would just tell amazon customers to give UA a chance and you'll really love it!!!!! I'm out!!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S. Forgot to mention that's this has about the best sound quality they've ever got from a studio album!!! The other great sounding recording was COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION way back in 1992 or thereabouts.

B0015AARJI|4.0|The product is very good, Good Holiday fully to people who wish to purchase.<br />I've tried several days without any kind of problems.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app is probably superfluous for most people. You can use the tiny little battery charge meter built into the Kindle. However, this one pops on when I open my Kindle and shows me with a nice large scale graph exactly what my battery situation is at that time.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|If you thought the biggest thing wrong with Farmville was Zynga, this is the game for you. Cute graphics, works just like it's meant to. I  am enjoying it and if you like these kinds of games, you will as well.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I use this on my Kindle to play Chess with the AI. The board is easy to see and it works well. Not a lot of options on the app but it gives you pretty much what you need to play well. It is an app I do keep coming back to and using on a regular basis.
1455526959|4.0|Book 18, in the Harry Bosch series<br /><br />After 18 novels over a 20 years span one would think Mr. Connelly would ran out of ideas for this series, but it seems this challenge is a no-brainer for a prolific author. \\"The Black Box\\" it is both a story of police procedural and one that continues the saga of the protagonist personal life. Harry has aged well through times, now in his 60s he has been working cold cases for years and has become a man sworn to speak for the dead.<br /><br />This latest opens with a chilling portrait of the war zone that L.A.'s South Central neighborhood became during the riots in the spring of 1992. When the body of Anneke Jespersen, a Danish journalist, is found in an alley, shot to death, Harry investigates, but amid the turmoil the case is not solved.<br /><br />Fast-forward to 2012, the 20th anniversary of the riots is coming up and there will be a great media attention to unsolved murders. Marty Maycock, the current chief of police assigns Harry to the daunting challenge of closing the Jespersen case.<br /><br />Of course there are few pieces to go by and Harry never failing zeal and his strong sense of guilt for not having solved the case in the first place provides the spark to get him started. He retrieves the archived boxes of Anneke's belongings and the investigative file. There's not much to go on, but some tantalizing leads develop before the nitwit lieutenant in charge of the cold-case unit tells him to drop it and w ork another case. It doesn't take long before the tenacious detective finds himself caught in a maelstrom of departmental politics and personal danger as he searches for the \\"black box\\" (piece of evidence, fact, etc.) But Harry never fails to amaze us and will eventually discover the truth.....<br /><br />Mr. Connelly excelled as always in building added tension into virtually all of Harry's decisions. He also pays attention to police procedural details while giving his protagonists lots of leeway. There are moments in the novel when the action goes into high gear and Harry transforms himself into a warrior, even in his 60s he still kick butts...all this for our enjoyment, of course I could not stop turning the pages to see what came next. The dialogue and narration are quite lively and fast moving exactly what we expect from the author. The result is a complex tapestry of plots, deftly crafted suspense and well-rounded characters.<br /><br />Even after all this time Mr. Connelly still manages to keep me a loyal fan...oments in the novel when the action goes into high gear and Harry transforms himself into a warrior, even in his 60s he still kick butts...all this for our enjoyment, of course I could not stop turning the pages to see what came next.

B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Has clear instructions on how to assemble. Easy to use. I had some pitting with the cutter when using but not sure if I'm applying too much pressure or if it was just the bottles I was using. The sand paper provided didn't last very long, other than that I like the product.
1587143879|5.0|While I have done the CCNA test before, this has proven to be the best study guide so far.  The chapters are short but still useful.  I really appreciate the study methodology that emphasizes immediate memory practice.
8866135909|5.0|This is the second time I've bought this same planner. It's just perfect -- the weekly format provides a journal-style page next to each week, which means I have plenty of room for to-do lists, etc. The soft cover feels nice, the bookmark is helpful, and the elastic band keeps it closed. There's a pocket in the back, and it actually came with a few sheets of stickers -- a nice bonus that wasn't included when I bought my first one two years ago.  Best of all, even though there's plenty of room to write, this planner fits in my purse -- meaning I actually take it places and use it! Highly recommended!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Ok...a.little slow...should be able to earn points quicker. Otherwise it's a fairly fun game over time.  I would recommend it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is so addictive. I love the history, the clothes, and story lines. I hope it goes on for years and takes right to the 1960's. simply fascinating
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Enjoyed this puzzler very much! Makes you really work to solve it and think about the clues. Fun and challenging and would love to go further with this one!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Boring..no substance at all. Nothing new was said. The greed to extend to a fourth book killed the third book by making it so bare that it was difficult to stiffle my yawns. Very disappointed. Huge let down !
B009WO7NQO|5.0|HD Star Wars is a lot of fun but not as easy as it looks. But it is a challenge and keeps the brain working
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|this is one of the classic books for conflict management and deservedly so as it is in a smooth format that transitions from topic to topic nicely.
0743297334|2.0|I had a really tough time with the character portrayal.  Characters seemed unrealistic to say the least.  This was a style really foreign to me and I was never really comfortable reading the book.  I kept waiting for something to happen.
B005VSRFEA|5.0|i stumbled upon this book and am glad I did. The world is a complicated place and this book is ideal for taking complex subjects and helping you understand a different way of looking at them to help break them down.
0446310786|5.0|One really saw the small southern town thru Scout's eyes.  Brilliantly written and a life's lesson on every page throughout the book.
B00AEBB8YW|1.0|So disappointed, this is one of my favorite movies, but this copy kept jamming and eventually just stopped altogether so that I couldn't finish watching it.  Since I'm in New Zealand it's not worth sending it back as the postage would cost more than the movie. :(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is amazing I love this game I love how I can change character when I want beware this game is very fun, addictive and amazing
B00021R7CG|5.0|This is definitely one that seems to have not made the radar when it came out.  Most people will find the story intriguing - highly recommended.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I have other games like this and this game is just as fun, and plus the neon colors are great.  When you start playing the levels are easy and as you continue the levels get harder.
B000001DQI|5.0|One of the best double albums of our lifetime.  It is rare that an album release is filled with hits; this one is top notch tunes all the way through.
B000P407K4|5.0|1964PG: This dark and serious subject matter comedy reminds me why I love films so much. They give us permission to mentally escape the horrible horrors of unpleasant realities like war. Each of us can see a little of ourselves in the twisted perspectives of Dr. Strangelove and idiosyncrasies of the other characters. The shameless mockery of how we expect people in power to behave is, in a Peter Sellers sort of way, beautiful. Case in point - \\"Gentlemen, you can't fight in here. This is the War Room!\\"<br /><br />This should be played in a non-stop loop on a big screen in the White House forever right along with Death by China (2013) - without the sound of course! Enjoy.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game, it really makes you think. graphics are good. I would like more levels. i wouldst recommend to friends.
B00BIR381W|5.0|I love Pretty Little Liars so everything about it is greatest especially the complete Third Season that u purchased at amazon.com
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game was interesting and challenging. I would like more levels to see if the difficulties will increase drematically. If this happens, a 5 star would result.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|i love the characters and they just keep you interested in what will come next in their lives. they are great for each other.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|It was great at the beginning but then it began to bore me when it became less  challenging. I hope that every one enjoys as much as I did at beginning.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Lee Child delivers another innovative plot. Will Reacher never get old? He continues to deliver insight and inductive as always.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I would definitely recommend it.  .I think it's good for a free game.<br />It could be longer but definitely  enjoyable. That is all I have to, say
1400031524|5.0|To coin a phase, a real page turner. Really I couldn't put it down. You have to just love this guy &#34;Wallander&#34;
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|This sequel to the 2010 feature Despicable Me was very well done and very cute.<br /><br />However it is a little short, as is the case with most sequels, when compared to the first in the series. I felt the first was at least a 8.75 out of 10 stars. I would rate this one more like 7.75 to 8.25 out of 10. A small step down but then the first one was very clever and well written. This one had a few more trouble spots IN/RE the story.<br /><br />The picture was superb and the sound was very good. Recommended for children and those young of heart.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Reserve a long weekend, since you will not be able to put this book down. Great detail, great characters and a good story, loved it.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|I liked this enough to buy it but understand those who think otherwise.<br /><br />Visually this movie is stunning. However the plot, character development and the actors performances left much that could have seen improvement. I didn't care all that much for either of the 'evil' witches. Their acting was at best ok. And I was disappointed in James Franco's performance - I've seen him do much better than this and that's the real problem - this movie NEEDED his best and didn't get it.<br /><br />The plot was uneven and the character development needed - well - development. The scene with the porcelain girl was great but the real problem was that was about it.<br /><br />I guess what is missing is a clearer vision of what they were trying to do. I was never sure what this movie was really about.<br /><br />It's a real shame as this movie had the potential to be a true classic. The start wasn't bad and the porcelain girl scene was great - the ending was ok as well - but the rest was just kind of there.<br /><br />If I could I would give this 3.25 out of 5 on Amazaon's scale<br /><br />On my (God - does that sound pretentious or what? LOL)scale I would rate this 7.0-7.5 out of 10.<br /><br />However on a visual basis I would give it a 9.0 to 9.5 out of 10.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|On the outside it looks somewhat promising, but lost interest just after just a couple minutes playing. I would agree with another review that recommends plasma sky.
B005UG542S|5.0|Loved the movie.....  arrived quickly and no skips or stalls in using the disc.  Great way to purchase if you live out in the sticks and don't want to go in town all the time!
B009A9BEHU|5.0|I recomend to buy it. Only a trouble; I receive it with a little damage in its plastic box. But this is not serious
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVE IT GREAT TO PLAY WITH OTHERS. NEED MORE ROOMS FAST. RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL AGES MY SON AND I LOVE IT.
B000002B35|5.0|I recomend to buy it;  for me it is the best concert album of Pink Floyd. Yhe sound is incredible
B00000IQCA|5.0|I saw many of my favorite stars in a comical light this movie was funny and I will enjoy watching it again and again.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|At times this book dragged on a bit but worth the read.  Made me laugh with the antics he got up to.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Ok i'm new to this I have done one other review and not sure what to write. I don't want to put to much into this and spoil it for others. I find that some reviews I have read that tell u about the book has spoilt it for me as I made a opinion based on the review. I try not to do that but can't help it which total sucks for me. So here it goes.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book I couldn't put it down and found that I didn't want it to end I just wanted more. I have found that Nalini Singh just can't go wrong in her books. I am so looking forward to her next books.<br /><br />All I will say is that we are now getting to know the Psy side of the story which I find very interesting and fascinating, I can't wait to see what see has come up with next.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I know alot of you are saying how it wasn't a good story line and Cassandra Clare just created another Harry Potter and I admit I thought it wasn't gonna be good too,but the minute I read the first page I could not put the book down.Everything from when Clary finds out she's a Shadowhunter to when Clary and Jace find out they are brother and sister (which you find out in the later books they aren't really),it's all just in my mind EPIC! I love all the humor in the book, the fatherness Clary feels toward Luke and NOT at all Valentine,the way Clare decribes every detail of what Clary sees,and just so much more I'd be typing all night long! So all in all I strongely recommend for whoever reads my review to read this book and the rest of them and after you read the book see the movie they made out of this books comes out August 21 and counting dowm the days till it's out! At 46 right now!!!
0345803485|5.0|My good friend wanted this book so bad so I bought it for her, she liked it a lot and read all of them. I've heard great things from everyone about how they were great and soft p*rn. She said she read it then well....jumped her man....

B008KOTNVA|5.0|One of the most useful toolkits you can buy working on computers and electronic. Not as nice case as the model up but really everything you need in one place for all those tiny repairs.
B000005JA8|1.0|The vast majority of people listening to this album would label it as &#34;absolute crap&#34;. But I'll try to be a bit more objective and restrained.<br /><br />To put it briefly and bluntly, this isn't really music. Oh sure I think detected a few basic blues riffs here and there (played badly of course) But the majority of the album is a sprawling mess of discordant jarring guitar twanging and notes accompanied by muffled bass and drums while Mr Beefheart barks, rasps and growls in yet another key. That's it! If you got an inmate in a lunatic asylum time in a studio with some mediocre session musicians and a pen and paper to write lyrics you might get this album. Some claim this album is carefully constructed. I don't believe them by the way but even if that were true it still falls flat, because if you played Beethovens Fifth Symphony at the same time as Abbey Road, Dvoraks New World Symphony and Neil Diamonds Greatest Hits you'd *still* end up with an gawdawful noise no matter how cleverly the parts may be constructed.<br /><br />Some say this album is &#34;Dadaist&#34;. Some might argue that rock and roll was never meant to be this pretentious. Whatever. But I don't think the spirit of Dadaism works for music. Music theory exists for a reason- it's what separates music from random noise. You can bend the rules of music a bit, people like Beethoven and Shostakovich did it a lot. But this album breaks the rules of music. Result? Just a horrible noise. You could record an album of retarded chimpanzees bashing a piano to bits with hammers and call it Dadaist and it would be hard to argue.<br /><br />I don't mind experimentation in music. The prog bands, alt rock, mood music (ie Tangerine Dream) all have some worthwhile moments. This album is proof to me that you can be as avant garde, wacky, zany downright KERRRR- AAAZY as you like but without good music to back the lyrics up you're wasting everyone's time. Yes it's a &#34;challenging&#34; listen, but that doesn'tautomatically class it as art. Listening to nails down a chalkboard is challenging, and who would enjoy that? People like it because it's odd, unusual, the type of thing that you shouldn't really like but feel a kick out of trying the taboo. The audio equivalent of eating chocolate covered grasshoppers or ants. The cover art, weird lyrics and arty mystique are the chocolate. The actual &#34;music&#34; is the grasshopper.<br /><br />It's something of an oddball album. Like Lou Reeds Metal Machine Music it can't be categorized readily, but there isn't much point to actually listening to it. My final, reasoned verdict? Trout Mask Replica is absolute crap.
B003GK22HK|5.0|This was a real page turner. It captivates you from the opening paragraph.Kate Morton is a brilliant storyteller .I loved this book.
1451695195|5.0|I'd seen this man on a talk show and was intrigued by his testimony of heaven..<br />I received the book within 3 days and started reading Proof of Heaven by Dr. eben Alexander and couldn't put it down!<br />Well done!
B0047VSW30|5.0|This movie is a great movie that open my eye to ancient history and how common they where to us modern humans, if human psychology has an evolution I think human have just barley have evolve I think 2000 year is just a millions of a second, It doesn't matter the religion or thoughts of human psych, just the idea of what is right to us humans counts as and evolution of idea will never evolve into another 1000 years
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is an enjoyable series that hooks the viewer from the start. The story lines are interesting and tend to keep you guessing.
B0074PNCRM|4.0|I liked the book but found it a sad read. The plot was interesting but you will need a box of tissues handy.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|This is the best blu-ray release yet. As all Trek fans know the 3rd season of TNG was the first to be really considered top quality. The effects and graphics quality on this release are great and the special features included have been great on all the releases. I will definitely buy all the seasons as long as they keep putting out quality products like this.
B00005JKZV|5.0|It came the day it said it would and I loved it and the movie so excited when it came
B006M4F67A|4.0|Fast,fun,very attention getting. I would recommend this to any one who asked.Much more fun than watching infomercials in an airport.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Like all 007 Bond movies, this is another blockbuster. It is action packed from the very start. I like it.
1451696191|5.0|I bought this on a whim and then was underwhelmed by the synopsis on the back.  For some reason, I decide to give it a read and COULDN'T put it down!  How unexpectedly delightful!  I haven't seen the movie, but for those who want a read that is great characters, a unique narrator, and an unpredictable book, read this!  Loved and and have recommended it to several friends!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Does exactly what you want it to do.  I would suggest integrating with some of the cloud storage apps out there and add a &#34;Download to $Cloud&#34; option.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|For any construction vehicle obsessed toddler this is a great gift- can't go wrong. I bought him other versions of diggers which were colored differently or didn't quite have enough detail to look like the REAL thing. Now every time we spot a backhoe on the street- which in NYC is quite often he screams with excitement &#34;it looks like my backhoe!&#34;<br /><br />For those wondering about how well it holds up- my son has used this to dig soil in the garden, and has bashed it around quite a bit. I've even run it under some water occassionally to clean it off- all works beautifully.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I was really impressed with the character development and would recommend it for adult viewing. Not suitable for a child.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|I really became angry reading about how the investment banks manipulated the system to increase their profits and had no desire to really understand what was in their phony mortgage backed products.  I also am upset that our government bailed out so many firms.  It really shakes up your confidence in our entire financial system.  But what other system can be made more honest.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|How Catherine Zeta-Jones made this movie I will never know.  She probably did this one for the money.  Horrible movie, terrible unbelievable plot line.  Next time please be more selective in choosing roles Catherine!!  Your acting is a whole lot better than this!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a powerful, interesting, educating story.  I had a hard time putting it down.  I highly recommend it to everyone.
B00CRWJ7VC|2.0|The acting was great by all, but the story was confusing.  I haven't read the book and got lost in who was who.  The way the same actors played multiple parts was very good and they were quite convincing.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Love this TV show!! Can't wait to see the other seasons! I love the chariters, Castle is so cute and Beacett is so cool

We  shared many stories we had not discussed before, bringing new appreciation for the diverse journeys women have taken, from our own mothers in the fifties and sixties, and our own experiences in the late sixties and seventies with career starts and stops while we raised our families. It was a lively and interesting discussion, and we agreed that &#34;Lean In&#34; should be shared with our sons or sons-in-law as well as our daughters.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|I love this CD! It reminds me of Adle kind of music. She has a great voice. Really moving lyrics
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|Viewed via Xbox.  The movie never reached HD quality- very disappointed.  Xbox was wired, I subscribe to 15mbps service (speedtest.net rates it around 10mbps when the movie was showing), and I've watched plenty of other movies and tv shows in HD with other services using the same connection.  Thought I would give Amazon a shot since the rental was a little cheaper.  In the future I'll be using Xbox Video, Vudu, Apple TV, or one of the many other options available to me.  I recommend that others do the same!<br /><br />Wish it would have at least given me the option do a delayed start to ensure HD- especially since Amazon had HD plastered all over the rental (or if it was available it sure isn't easy to find).  Also wish I would have checked around a little more before I rented.  It doesn't seem to be and isolated issue.  Buyer beware.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This show just keeps getting better with each season. My husband and I watch some of the episodes over and over.
B0000549B0|5.0|I saw Harvey when I was in the 8th grade.  I'm now 31 years old, and I've seen it maybe twice since.  One day I decided to search Amazon, where I buy a lot of things, and lo and behold I found it.  It was an immediate purchase.  This is a light, family friendly movie that's well worth the small price.  Jimmy Stewart does a really great job in this movie, however, I've read that he wanted the character to be darker than what was actually depicted.  At any rate, I enjoy the lighter version of this.  Funny, entertaining, and all around good movie to watch.
1442419814|3.0|So where do I even begin with this book. Well first of all the concept of the book is great. We already live in a world (or at least a country) obsessed with materialism, beauty, plastic surgery and all things Hollywood so why NOT write a book focusing on what the world would be like if we were all forced to be beautiful and undergo an operation to get there? Unfortunately the only thing that kept me reading all the way to the end was this concept. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br /><br />Things that were just wrong with this book:<br />1. There are no REAL problems in this dystopia. Yes they force you to undergo a surgery that makes you pretty but is beauty REALLY a problem? As the author said there are no more wars, green energy and recycling is taken to a whole new level (they don't even like to cut down trees...what is so bad about that?)and everything you could ever need comes out of a wall.<br /><br />2. I think the author created this dystopian future a little too perfect. In this case, the fact that the government is pretty controlling isn't that bad. For example, yes they put a lesion in your brain to make you feel happy and as if nothing is wrong (well nothing is really wrong to be honest) but they don't tell you what is the point of this lesion. Is it to eventually destroy everyone? Is it to turn them into zombie-like cyborgs who the government can use as their own little mind controlled army in order to destroy the Smoke? No...it is just to keep them mindless and having fun and reassured that everything is going to be cool so that nobody can complain. But even if they didn't have this lesion there is NOTHING to complain about. All cities are self sufficient and everything is perfect.<br /><br />3. The little romance the author attempts to create between Tally and David is pretty half-assed. They barely know each other and within a couple of days they are \\"in love\\" but they come off more as friends/people who need to survive in order to rescue their friends and family than anything else. Point-blank there is no real romance. It comes off very fake and forced.<br /><br />4. The Smoke actually comes off like a worse place to live in than the cities. You have to work a lot harder to get a lot less. When a person is used to something being provided out of a wall compared to having to trade everything you have for a few items which do you REALLY think they would choose?<br /><br />5. Shay comes off as the true heroine at first. Mature and wise beyond her years or experience. But as soon as Tally shows up to The Smoke, she becomes very childish and jealous over a guy she barely knows. When did she become so damn whiny?<br /><br />6. I have no sympathy for Tally. She complains the entire time, has no real goals and cannot figure out what she really wants. Even towards the end of the book she doesn't even know if she loves David but can't stand to not be around him? Yeah, okay, really believable. Shay asks her if she loves him and Tally's response is maybe...hmm yet you can't fathom the idea of being without him for more than a few hours. The girl is super confused all the time.<br /><br />I only gave it such a high rating because certain parts were good. When Tally firsts sneaks into New Pretty Town (wow what an original name) the book comes off adventurous. Also when she has to travel alone to The Smoke does the book pick up again. The last and final adventurous time is when they have to rescue everyone from their underground prisons and when she decides to go back to the city to turn pretty in order to go through with their plan to find a cure. Besides that the entire book goes on side stories that are kind of pointless for example going on and on about hoverboards, Shay wanting to always go on an \\"adventure\\" on hoverboards, etc. Also constantly carrying on about \\"Rusties\\" (aka us) and the environment when it really had nothing to do with the original concept of the story and adds nothing to the entirety of the book. I might onlycontinue reading the next book because I want to see if they go along with the cure and what Tally is like when she is pretty. Overall the book isn't all that it is cracked up to be and a pretty shallow and superficial story with no real point. In reality I agree with everything that the those who gave it a 1 and 2 star rating said. Maybe if given to another author the book could have and would have been a hit.
B00CATSONE|4.0|With this book, you get a sort of self-help book about imagination, i.e. thinking and doing.  You also get a short biography of Tesla.  I enjoyed both components, and Tesla is a really great icon of imagination.  This is a good read.
B00APJLY0Q|1.0|What could have been a great movie for kids with a cool concept or idea for a story just did not deliver. It was so incredibly boring and really just not funny (sorry but Adam Sandler stop being funny years ago). It was in fact so boring that I didn't even finish watching it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Touching, gripping and sooo well written! This is one of those rare books you will want to add to your permanent collection, share with those you love and reread every so often. An absolute must have! Buy it, read it, share it - you'll be glad you did!
B004FA8NOQ|5.0|I've had this processor since January 2013 and I have it up to 4.4ghz and haven't even really done any fine tuning yet to see what the limitations of it are.
1423140591|3.0|I'm 19, but my guilty pleasure is going back and reading the YA fiction series that I used to love so much (Max Ride, Percy Jackson, Harry Potter). Admittedly, at my age I am no longer the target audience for many of these books, and often I find the writing childish and overly-simplistic. However, I can still enjoy the plot and there is no arguing that reading teen fiction is fun if nothing else.<br /><br />I'm going to assume you all have read The Lost Hero, which I read with hopes that the second book would be much better, in terms of plot and character development among much else. Unfortunately, the Son of Neptune had virtually the same story. The main character has lost his memory and must undertake a quest to rescue someone in a couple days as well as defeat two giants. He has with him two partners who have some romantic interest in each other, and of course they both have deep dark secrets. Along the way they bump into various characters from Greek myths, etc. This worked in the first series, but it's starting to get old. Furthermore, Riordan seems to think that his readers really want romance because everyone is in a couple. Even if this is true, it doesn't change the fact that Riordan cannot for his life write romance. In PJO, romance sat in the backseat where it belonged and was never a major player, though it did appear here and there in appropriate amounts.<br /><br />The character development is stronger here than in TLH, though it couldn't have gotten worse. Blackjack had more character development  in PJO than Jason did in TLH. Here Riordan has created a couple more characters that are certainly more interesting (most notably Octavian and Reyna). We do get to know Hazel and Frank better as the story progresses, and they do grow as characters, so I can't complain.<br /><br />Finally, this third person writing style that Riordan has adopted doesn't work. Cover the names above the chapters when you read it and you will barely be able to tell whose point of view it's supposed to be from. Only when they have one of their flashbacks or dreams will you be able to tell. We no longer get to see the characters' thought process or emotions. We lost Percy's wit and humor. Riordan writes better in first-person. PJO and the Kane Chronicles speak for themselves. His choice to do this added nothing to the book, and if anything detracted from it.<br /><br />As a side-note, can someone tell me why Annabeth knew around where Percy was for about 7 months and did nothing to search for him, even though she was going crazy in the beginning? Or why Percy remembers his girlfriend of 2 months but not his mother? Or why Hera/Juno had to erase Jason's and Percy's memories because it seems like it would've been fine if Percy had retained his.<br /><br />3 stars. Enjoyable but needs improvement. A far drop in quality from PJO.of view it's supposed to be from. Only when they have one of their flashbacks or dreams will you be able to tell.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|enjoyed the game.  makes you think in ways you might not normally when trying to figure out the puzzle. would like more levels
B008RTE066|5.0|A very great set for magical Mystery Tour. The music and the film, It's all there with a magical mystery tour Ticket and a paperback book that has a ton of great MMT info. Inside there is a remastered reissue of the UK E.P. in mono. along with a blu-ray and a DVD of the film with comes with a multitude of spectacular special features. Satisfies ANY beatles fan. Definatly worth five stars!!
B00338QENI|5.0|Wonderful but sad story. I first heard of Henrietta Lacks in a cell biology class I took in college. My teacher p discussed the book rather briefly and ever since I have wanted to read it. Now that I finally have it was well worth the wait.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I enjoyed this series about the beginnings of Enterprise and its crew and I'm having fun watching it with my daughter who has reached an age that she is interested in it as well.  The only negative in watching this is that the video quality is pretty low.  Everything looks much darker that it should.  Other streamed shows don't have this issue.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|this game had a good idea, though it was very poorly implemented. Every time you destroy a ship you get several indestructable tracking mines. you can maybe take one for a hit, but two andyour ship is lost and you lose a life.  It also has no real balance or goal.  uninstalled.
0544002318|5.0|Really easy to read. Very inspirational. You don't need to be a vegan or a runner to be inspired by Jurek.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one of the most fun ways build huge mansions on creative and to survive in survival. I have played a lot of fun games but none as much fun as minecraft. I rated this game a five star because that's what it obviously deserved.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|In my opinion, I love this game. One of the best! Each level is harder and it's difficulty makes it more fun. After you find more clues they leave you on a cliffhanger. I'm waiting for the upgrades. I can't wait for harder levels! This game never disappoints! Good game! -Kassidy
B00AECGQF2|5.0|it's AMAZING! I love it! It is the best game ever! I play it everyday. It is a great game
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This movie brought me to tears, moved me to belief . Such beautiful scenery and strong emotion. Must own movie, destined to be a classic right up there with gone with the wind.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|I could (and do!) listen to this over and over.  It's a great mix of songs that are well performed.  Like the movie, this soundtrack is just a great summery break from anything serious.  I love it.
B009PAETCG|1.0|Highly recommend anyone to NOT use this app! Ever since I downloaded it for my son, the app would get stuck (never got it to work) and then my kindle would just suddenly shut off. App has been removed from the kindle but I still get the suddenly shutting down problem. AARRGH!
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Like a lot of people, I've gone back to this in preparation for a Before Midnight theater experience.<br /><br />Before Sunset picks up nine years after the end of Before Sunrise, its pleasant, conversation-heavy predecessor set in Vienna.  The tone is much the same here, but the characters are older and more mature - and yet demonstrate the same kind of youthful romantic attraction evident in the first movie.  It's charming.  The rapport between Delpy and Hawke's characters really feels like Paris itself. It's intimate, romantic, and perhaps friendlier and more familiar than you'd expect.  It doesn't move too quickly, but it's far from sleepy.  It's sweet, but not overly sappy.  And like an intense fling or a visit to the city of light, I wish it had lasted longer.
0345529057|5.0|I just started reading them and it engaged me that much that if my friends blow off our fridaynight partyplans lastimute I dont give a monkey coz that means that I have some hours now to read Game of Thrones 8-)
B000P0J09W|5.0|Happy that I found it on DVD because everywhere I looked, it was on VHS.  My son loves this movie and watches it all the time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game. It is easy to play and gets more challenging the longer you play, and its free.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Always good characters even if some other parts are lacking. I learned more about WWI than I knew before reading.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If your looking for a horse game this is it .it's awesome the best one you will ever find. Buy it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game! Makes you do a lot of thinking and remembering. This game is very good for the brain. Highly recommended!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This camera app is a good working app. Don't listen to the people that say that it doesn't work because it does. It has cool effects like solarize and mono or aqua and a lot more. It saves your pictures that you take with it. It also has a timercam. I recommend this app
B00129H7VS|5.0|I recommend this product to every adult in America, in fact I wish it were mandatory to watch it. Perhaps some of the na/sayers in this country would understand the necessities of some wars, and the difference we can make as American soldiers.  It is a moving story and portrayed very well. My grandchildren have watched it with me, and they too enjoyed the series.
B006S08RLU|5.0|This is a wonderful and delightful film to watch.  Everything about it is artistically done, from the music, the décor, the choice of colors, the script, the acting, the narrative and the story in itself.  One of the most beautiful ways to describe loneliness, love, and bravery.  Highly recommended.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Glitches ruin an otherwise great app.  Game doesn't save properly so any progress you made is completely lost.  Same problem with glory points.  Additionally, game often locks up when first loading forcing a complete system reboot.  Experienced same problems with other Gameloft apps.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this game.
0062124293|5.0|This is a must read for any woman. Moran's wit allows her to effectively tackle difficult topics in an educated, well-written manner. The comparisons to Tina Fey seem weak, however. Fey's prose is funny and skims the surface of feminist discourse, while Moran is hilarious and directly addresses urgent, gendered problems. Buy a copy for yourself and an additional copy for lending out!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Since I grew up reading Sherlock Homes the original, I was a bit skeptical and late to arrive to this one but once I watched one episode, I really got hooked on this one The relationship or interaction between Sherlock and Watson is done so perfect, the plots are fast paced, the script so tight and the supporting cast equally good (I just love Aiden as the Captain) that I will recommend this to everyone who loves suspense! Johney Lee and Lucy liu are just outstanding in their roles. I even got my 18 year old son to love this one.
B000JRYNXE|5.0|Every track is dope. Original and fresh. Love it Gwen. One of those records that will never get old! She doesn't disappoint.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Not hard to increase levels.  Very quick game to play &amp; catch on.  Get high score easy.  Easy to play.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|ANOTHER GOOD ONE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL ALICIA. SO CLASSY AND NICE LIKE USUAL. PLUS THIS SONG CONTAINS EMPIRE STATE OF MIND PART 2 WHICH IS FAR BETTER THAN JAY-Z'S VERSION. WORD UP.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This book just reinforces my love for Neil Gaiman, and it makes me determined to dig out that copy of The Color of Magic that I bought and haven't read yet.<br /><br />Good Omens is the tale of the apocalypse, brought on by the antichrist. There are a lot of characters in the book, but the main ones are the angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley. The two have been stationed by their respective sides on earth, keeping an eye on things and working for the eventual victory of their side. They do little things here and there to win souls for either heaven or hell. They have both been on earth since the beginning of humanity and have grown rather fond of both the earth and the humans who populate it. Neither is very excited about the idea of the apocalypse coming along to destroy it all.<br /><br />I'm sure that people who have been fans of the book for a long time already have realized the similarities between Crowley in Good Omens and Crowley from the TV series Supernatural. As this was my first read of the book, it was a pleasant little surprise for me.<br /><br />I mostly read this as a kindle book, but I have also listened to the audiobook of the first half. I have to say, the audiobook is pretty spectacular. Of course, I keep hearing the reader's voice as I am reading the normal ebook to myself but that isn't really a bad thing.<br /><br />If you've never read Neil Gaiman, this is a good jumping in point, it's funny and has great characters. The Four Horsemen were some of my favorites.
1576875776|5.0|I've seen Maier's original prints in exhibitions and this book presents a fine selection.  The  reproduction is great.  The book's a real bargain.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|Whoa ! What a great movie ! I normally only only write reviews about concert DVDs these days, but this flick was such a shock to my system I felt compelled to convey my impressions on it.<br /><br />I'm not one to give away the plot so I'll stick to the basics here : a group of amateur fellas shooting a pilot for a paranormal investigation series lock themselves up in an abandoned mental institution for one night. They do not even believe in the paranormal and are in it for the cash. But many a spooky surprise await them as the night develops.<br /><br />This is another ¨camcorder movie¨ in the vein of The Blairwitch Project¨ -which started the trend to begin with- only SO much better. It caused me to literally JUMP in my couch and gave me a sweaty nightmare that night, and I'm a 52-year-old fella and a seasoned horror movie buff who thought nothing could shock me anymore; man was I wrong !They didn't even resort to music to create the atmos and that's a tough acomplishment.<br /><br />The film is fantastically edited with great 1.78:1 pic (so it filled my screen,unlike so many horribly letterboxed movies that are OK at the movies but make you feel cheated if your TV is less than 50¨) with great sound to match. Loved the very convincing acting, the CGI -which I normally don't care for- and the fact that the purposely bland beginning gives way to one of the spookiest films I've ever watched.<br /><br />So glad I got it. Keeper.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have never been so moved by a Musical Production from start to finish!! Absolutely re-watchable multiple times!!! I recommend Les Miserables wholeheartedly!

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The puzzles in The Room are unique and the accompanying story holds your interest.  It is the best puzzle game ever!
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I ordered this since it was a dual charger.  It accepts the chargers for both my android based phone and my husband's iPhone (or our iPads).  This will be great when we travel.  So far so good for the item.  It is small enough to fit in the area where my VW has the power point (which is not overly roomy) and still has room for the cords to plug into it.  I gave it 4 stars for convenience.  Once I see how well it charges it may get an extra star.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game was pretty fun. It has good graphics and good minigames within it. I would recommend it for anyone who is just bored or looking for a horse game.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I liked that this book is written with a grasp of current events, facts and places.  I liked the characters especially Clay.  I did think that the plot was a little simplistic and everything fell into place a bit too neatly for Clay.  The story is well told.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The character development in this book went much deeper into the &#34;why&#34; Grey is the way he is, and why Ana means so much to him. I really enjoyed the plot development of this book much better than the first book as well. James did a good job of going into the psychology aspect without beating you over the head with a textbook about it. I look forward to reading the conclusion of the trilogy.
0812983459|5.0|This book is full of memorable and touching characters.  Harold comes to realize life is for living.  His wife, Maureen, makes peace with the past and forgives both her husband and herself.  Queenie, who meant so much to Harold in life, dies with dignity.  Get out the box of tissues for the end.
B005LY3VRO|4.0|Britney has some neat songs that I wanted so I could listen to the whole song and not just a minute of it in a sound clip. It was worth purchasing and I can listen as long as I like. Got to my house quite quick.
B00APYKXFS|4.0|Techno Trancer is in no way a terrible game. It's difficult yes, so the best audience for this game would be players who excel in 2D overhead space shooters, not for casual players looking for a new game. It's a fun challenge that I will play with friends to see who can get the farthest while avoiding millions of projectiles and collecting orbs for your invisibility shield. I would've liked a name input for the ranking system though.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Love it and wanted to own the series after watching them on TV. What can I say. FAN! Can't wait for season 3 to come out.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I am a big fan Of all of the Versions of out the rope games and this one is challenging and innovative . They do a great job coming up with new ideas and puzzles . If you loved Cut the Rope or Angry Birds you will adore this game. Great for kids and adults.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|Loved watching the show and I had to purchase the cd to listen to all the music. It really is neat how they decided to sing a song for the American fans.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very interesting game. Probably my second favorite feature on my Kindle after reading. Additional levels are available to purchase, but free ones take a while too. Just check out the 14x14!!!
B004KSQN7C|4.0|Came in a different case than what I was expecting, but it works and I like the songs and can listen to the songs over and over. I was shocked at some of the songs, but enjoy listening to them.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|Doesn't do much except for a full-screen battery picture, percentage, and whether your kindle is on AC power, USB or running on battery. Showing battery percentage remaining can be turned on in kindle settings anyways, and it will always be next to battery indicator - I deleted this app as soon as I found that out
B0006FO8RA|3.0|I like some of the songs on this album and some I don't of course. I purchased it and it got to me pretty quickly. I can re-listen to the album any time I would like to.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Thank you for making me aware of what I would do when I would not be afraid ! I will keep this quote in mind while I go for the executive role I want to achieve.<br /><br />Ilse
B00006J3WH|5.0|I was watching Buffy and realized I liked the music so I decided to purchase the soundtrack from the episode since some of the singing is totally awesome. Glad the actors were able to sing the songs themselves and not get doubles. Purchased it used and works great.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Not as good as the first.<br />Too many contrived situations, and more sex than necessary.<br />However, I'll probably read the third
B000AAF1U4|1.0|I hate the movie, but my sisters family loves it. I bought it for a family Christmas gift and her husband had it opened and watching when she got home. The family really enjoys it and keeps watching it over and over.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is perfect for people that think outside the box or who want to.  This game needs more levels! Hurry up and start updating please.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I did like this book, but it felt a little thin.  I know Collins has a spare style but I have to say that I prefer the movie versions of her books.  The movies are generally told in third person which helps give the stories a richer texture than her first-person narrative allows.  Still, I'm hooked and I'm going to buy the third book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun game.if you enjoy room escape game.. try it! works fine on the kindle. pay attention to everything in each room.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is just so funny.  She's so good at finding surprising ways of looking at things.  She's so good at the unexpected joke.  And she has such a breezy style, that it's easy to read this book in one sitting.  I had to pace myself.  It's just plain, good, clean fun.
0525478817|5.0|I am a self professed bookworm, but I am also a self professed non-crying bookworm. As in the only time I've ever cried during a book was at the end of Harry Potter 7 (and that was mostly to grieve for the end of my childhood).<br /><br />But this. THIS. The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. It's raw and beautiful and funny and profound and it has immediatelyshotuptooneofmytopbooksofalltime. OFALLTIME. I haven't read a good book in ages. And I mean ages, because in college I didn't have a lot of free time for leisure reading. And I mean good, because when I did have spare time, there was a lot of mediocre text my eyes unnecessarily wasted energy on.<br /><br />I'm obviously still riding the emotional rollercoaster (read: rambling), but I highly recommend this book. And I'm so serious about the laughter, because this author has got the snarky humor I love. And I'm also serious about the tears, because this book is about a terminally ill girl who unexpectedly falls in love. (What? It's a love story? YES SHUT UP, READ IT.)<br /><br />After I finished the book I continued to bawl my eyes out and obviously at that moment my sister barges in asking for a ruler and instead sees me pathetically crying on my bed. So through hiccupy sobs I give her my ruler and wave her away with some embarrassment. Yeah, whatever.<br /><br />Do I have to reiterate? Please read it, guys.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I find Tina Fey hilarious.  I loved her on Saturday Night Live doing Weekend Update.  I loved 30 Rock.  She makes me laugh constantly.  I enjoyed every page of this book and wanted it to go on much longer.  The jokes were funny and she revealed a lot of personal details about her life which we have no right to know (but I'm glad to know it anyway).  Good read.
0525952926|4.0|read the first book and knew i wanted to follow this family through the next generation.  did not want to wait for the paperbook to come out in aug. so bought the hard cover book and will pass it along to daughter who is reading the first book in the series.  liked amazon price and quick delivery.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm a big fan of Margarat Atwood, so I'm predisposed to loving dystopian, futuristic literature. The Hunger Games delivers on a bleak view of our society in years to come.  It's believable.  It's interesting.  And it's well written.  Love it.
B003L7DK74|5.0|Awkward humor in the same vein as The Office, combined with oblivious humor from Rhys Darby's Murray Hewitt.  There are episodes during which I'm laughing the whole time and unable to swallow my drink without fear of choking.  The musical numbers are original and clever as well.  Great show, too bad it got canceled.  I hope the movie is actually made and not just a Fleetwood Mac album.
1451695195|5.0|This was interesting as it was from a non-believing doctor's point of view.  Don't get to see that too often.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|The unit is a great connection for my Delphi Roady XM Radio to my Can-Am Spyder RT Roadster's input plug. Can play the XM Radio direct now instead of using the FM transmitter power plug. Great product!
B002VPE1WK|2.0|I bought this to hold my Nikon D7000 and my other lenses. It all fits in nicely with no room to spare. I have the chargers, cables, and card readers in some of the pockets. So from a storage aspect it would get 5 stars.<br /><br />Here is why I had to rate it 2 stars.<br /><br />I went to adjust the straps on it to wear it and this is where it is just about a deal breaker. The padded shoulder straps are way to short on the padding part. To try and wear it comfortably the pack needed to be down my back slightly which caused my shoulders to be right on the end of the padding. The chest strap is placed way to high, as all it will do is choke you if used. I do not consider myself to be large @ 5'10\\", 187lbs but this pack is just about unusable as a back pack. Which is what I wanted, carry my camera and lenses around while out doing things.<br /><br />Here is the kicker.<br /><br />I had my eight year old daughter try it on and fitted it up to her. It fit her perfectly and said it was very comfortable (minus how heavy it was). All the straps worked perfectly and were placed correctly on her tiny body. So unless you are 4'6\\" and 65lbs this will not fit your back comfortably for any sort of time in stock form.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Great product and great film a great series as well. This prequel seemed sort of rushed but had its moments.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I was a little nervous about ordering this, didnt want to get stuck with another one hit wonder CD.  The music is good, really good!  Actually looking to get one of his earlier recordings.
0425263924|5.0|Recieved my book in time for my vacation & got to read the whole book because of rain the whole weekend.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|This game was not impressive to me.  Your ship and enemies are same color.  To much moving around to stay alive. Playing field to small for what is required.  Played for 20 minutes and deleted.  Luckily it was free app of the day.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Let me start by saying, I'm a huge fan of happy endings and no cliffhangers. That being said, this book was perfect for me. I know the author has said there'd be a follow up, which is great, but this book doesn't leave you hanging and desperate for a release date.<br />The book is written in the lead Males POV and has you watching from the outside looking in. A cool different writing style I haven't seen yet.<br />You have a strong female who doesn't put up with a rich hotties BS, even though with some of the things he tries, I totally would have caved:)<br />Fun twists and challenges to a concept we're seeing a lot right now.<br />Definite 5 star!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is amongst one of Nicholas Sparks best books. It's hard to put the book down and it had twists and turns and romance and thrill. It was just plainly amazing. I highly recommend this book.
B003YMNVCA|5.0|Gives a really good overview on most of the things an unix administrator needs to know. I prefer the kindle version. The printed version would be too heavy to carry around :)
0061978078|4.0|Unlike Delirium which follows Lena's romance with Alex and her struggles with what she believes about the world she lives and the disease she was taught to fear, Pandemonium chronicles Lena's life among the Invalids and her struggle to fight to keep her feelings felt. Where Lena once felt that the disease was worse than death she now believes the CURE is much worse than she would have ever imagined. Along with a cast of new Invalids friends from the strong and authoritative, Raven, to the quiet and mysterious, Blue. These people Lena was taught to fear and hate accept her better than anyone else she knew in her previous life.<br /><br />As well as struggling with her new role in life, Lena was face facts that Alex was not going to be there for her while she learned the ropes of the Wilds. She mends her broken heart to the best of her ability with a little help from a new character, Julian.<br /><br />This book was interesting in the way it was formatted. Instead of having different character perspectives, it would switch back and forth through time. It would tell of Lena's \\"rebirth\\", as she put it, in the Wilds and then switched to the present where she was on a mission for the resistance, a band of Invalids who attempt to reform the society of the cured. Along the way is an interesting connection between Lena and Julian which left me feeling a bit uneasy. I was such a big fan of Alex from the first book and was not ready to let go of the Lena-Alex romance.<br /><br />When I first picked up the book and started reading and realized that Alex wasn't in it, I almost tossed it aside. That would have been an incredibly poor mistake. I am not one to leave things unfinished. Especially not a book series. So I pushed through and went along with the emotional rollercoaster. The book got better and the new cast of characters made for interesting back stories and interactions with Lena. I believe that this book did not fall into the dreaded slump that most sequels do. This one actually powered through and was about the same quality as the first book in the series. Overall, I liked the book and am hard-pressed to start Requiem because I am afraid it will be the end of the series. With fingers crossed that the series doesn't end and two thumbs up for this book, I can safely say that Pandemonium and the Delirium series are a must read.<br /><br />Review posted on: [...]e actually powered through and was about the same quality as the first book in the series.

B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Nice game.  So far has good pacing and is a fun time.  Lots of entertainment for the money. Hope the second half is as good as the first

B005VT42BS|5.0|Yes seconds after download, it worked and let me do all I wasn't able to do for the last few days, like watch videos, or Pandora, or Skype. I am out of town and encounter a new router which made it difficult for my Kindle to connect properly but with this app, it is a breeze now.

B009EHDU7U|5.0|I enjoyed the book because of the dry humour and the interesting subject matter.<br />It gave me a sense of history as well as optimism for elder people facing their future.<br />No matter how old a person is, they want to feel needed and be useful.<br />Also, everyone has a story and some have more interesting stories than others.<br />I enjoyed the novel because it was different and was written with tongue in cheek which made it delightful.

B00CMYRVAO|5.0|In his two decade career, Opelika, Alabama native Joe Thomas has maintained a level of consistency. He made a career off being the sensitive loverman and hasn't strayed too far from his roots. After he left high school, he signed a deal with Mercury Records to release his 1993 debut \\"Everything\\". While he scored a few top 20 hits, Mercury didn't know what to do with a singer who was the complete opposite of his onetime labelmate Brian McKnight. He asked for a release from his contract, while writing and producing for other artists- notably Hi-Five and Usher. He landed a huge hit with \\"All The Things (Your Man Won't Do)\\" while still being an unsigned artist. He landed on Jive Records in 1997, where he would release his classic sophomore effort \\"All That I Am\\". While still writing and producing for other artists (Profyle, Ideal, Xscape, The Temptations) and dueting with Big Pun and Mariah Carey, he saw his biggest success right around the corner. In 2000, he released his third album- the most successful of his career \\"My Name Is Joe\\". The next few years saw him release three more records for Jive- the underrated \\"Better Days\\", the middling \\"And Then...\\" and his final album for the label \\"Ain't Nothin' Like Me\\".<br /><br />He went independent for his next three albums on the reactivated Kedar Entertainment. He started with the uptempo \\"Joe Thomas, New Man\\", followed by the live instrumentation of \\"Signature\\" and 2011's \\"The Good, The Bad, The Sexy\\". He was handpicked by LL Cool J for the song \\"Take It\\" from LL's recently released album \\"Authentic\\". Joe's longtime manager Kedar Massenburg started a new label after the folding of Kedar Entertainment called Massenburg Media. It would be there where Joe would release his newest album \\"Double Back: Evolution Of R&B\\". While the album's title speaks of evolving, it's really a continuation of his 2009 album \\"Signature\\". Joe handles the writing and production of roughly half the album, though he brings along a few familiar names. The production team Stargate- who previously worked with Joe on the song \\"If I Was Your Man\\"- handles the song \\"Compromise\\", in which Joe tries to find common ground with his significant other. The production team The Ambassadorz (who previously appeared on \\"The Good, The Bad, The Sexy\\") contributes the sensual ballad \\"More\\". Producer Derek \\"D.O.A.\\" Allen (Best known for Blackgirl's \\"Krazy\\" and Tyrese's \\"Lately\\") handles production on four songs- \\"Easy\\", the Fantasia Barrino duet \\"Love & Sex\\", the Too Short featured \\"1 To 1 Ratio\\" and the first single \\"I'd Rather Have A Love\\". Finally, Joe sings of making poor decisions while falling in love on the ode to strippers \\"Magic City\\". Joe's \\"Double Back: Evolution Of R&B\\" is another great album from the veteran talent. With twenty years under his belt, he shows that he still has it and hasn't lost a step in his music.s.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Carefully plotted, with plenty of surprises and cliff hangers. Characters are painstakingly created individuals, all with flaws and (most with) merits, but the author doesn't give them an easy time of it -- neither the likable nor despicable ones.  A terrific read.  This is my favorite of the series so far.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Well, I grew up with the Eagles, and I must say this has everything and more.  They are STILL the BEST!!!!!  Go Eagles and keep those Final Farewell Tours coming!
B0091WNK8M|1.0|I wanted to watch this movie with my 9 yrs old  kid  but was really  annoyed by the  inappropriate language  and  some  actions in the movie,  like when a  kid  was mistranslating  into Spanish  intentionally,  meant to be funny,  however what's funny in saying \\" the attic  contains  sexual torchering devices\\"!
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|I liked this movie. My granddaughter watched it with me and wanted the movie. I bought this copy for her.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Good standard fantasy novel. Entertaining and quickly plotted a good and worthy read. Got what I expected from the blurb.
B001E75QH0|5.0|If you like the Indiana Jones series, then you already know about these movies.  Harrison Ford is so good in this and they are just fun.
B002KC8BSO|4.0|Found this cult classic to be a good movie.  &#34;This is my BOOM stick&#34; is a classic line!  A little on the gory side but it's meant to be over the top.
0767827791|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  What more can you say about William Holden and Kim Novak except they are great in this movie.  No dirty language or violence, just the kind of story that those of us that grew up in the 50s can relate to.  Love it.
B009RH9J7W|3.0|I got this kindle for me and this cover is OK. The descriptions and pictures do not tell the entire story of how it works. This product snaps into hard plastic and I still not sure if it will stay with out coming out easily.  Also the stand aspect has slots in the cover but not much of anything to hold kindle at position.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|Great compilation of Elvis and his music. This is well done and highly recommend. One of the better comps. of Elvis music.

B003QP4NPE|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in years.  It's uncanny predictions (about technology) are simply fact now.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really enjoyed the game. My favorite part is where u can fly on the rope. But the best part of the entire game is where u try to get the high scote
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Wow, I loved this movie !! The wit spectacular, and of multi-faceted dimensions. From sarcastic humor to both dry, and plain hysterical !! The characters different, and all intriguing in their own fashion. The plot very good, and leaving room for future sequels. Although I didn't care much for Mark Ruffalo, as Banner it didn't ruin the movie. I am quite happy I purchased it !!
0062080237|4.0|This was a great game of guess the god. They didn't all age especially well either. Odin, Queen of Sheba, Czernobog, Anansi, Horus, Anubis, Thoth, and even Kali are some of the old gods in this clever and funny novel.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|An excellent sequel, very anxious to see what happens next. Only thing that sucks is we have to wait probably at least till next year..
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good fun and good app. Like the visuals. Like the helps but do not need as many as there are.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|It remains pure classic Black Sabbath.  Ozzys voice is incredible. Tommys guitar is out if this world. Gezzers bass playing is awsome.  And then the drums.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|As a male this book could not leave my hands for one bit! I enjoyed it so much! And it leaves you wanting for more! A special romance which you can really learn something special from. Great book!  Well done Mc'Guire!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Start a new addiction with this must have T.V. Once you get started on the series you won't be able to quit until you are caught up.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I was hesitant at first to get this app but afterwards I was so glad I had!!! After a few minutes of listening to some of my self-made melodies both me and my dog were blissfully asleep!! I could literally feel myself becoming less stressed :)<br /><br />I would absolutely give this app the highest recommendation! It works faultlessly on my Kindle as well ;D
B00005N6KG|2.0|The plastic headband is too flimsy and doesn't stay in place well. I wouldn't buy this product again or recommend it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|À dreamlike fantasy. Very pleasing. Vintage Gaiman. Enjoyed every word of it. Appreciated the book not being longer than it needed to.
0393312836|1.0|A Clockwork Orange is one of those books that is chiefly aimed for brainless teenaged fanboys that have absolutely no idea what is cool or like to label uncool whatever as &#34;cool.&#34; Henceforth the oversaturation of love for Stanley Kubrick's vision of Anthony Burgess' heap of trash.<br /><br />It took me fifty pages into A Clockwork Orange to get used to the language and another 150 odd pages to get through the dreck of a read. Alex keeps referring himself as &#34;Your Friend...&#34; when he is never a one. Violence, actually ultra-violence, abounds on every page throughout the book while the slangy, viz. nadsat, words are being used for descriptive purposes.<br /><br />Because of the impossibility of almost every situation that occurs, A Clockwork Orange is one of the most unrealistic books I've had the displeasure to read. It is also manipulative in terms of human emotions, criminal proceedings, and physics.<br /><br />On the other hand, A Clockwork Orange comes in two different editions: the British and the American. The former consists of 21 chapters and the latter with one less. So there starts the debate: which one is better?<br /><br />Well, in my opinion, A Clockwork Orange should have ended at chapter 19 when Alex threw himself out of the window. Good riddance, right there.<br /><br />Philosophically speaking, the novella fails on so many levels that I began to laugh in spite of myself.<br /><br />All in all, A Clockwork Orange is one of those stories that has gotten way too much overpraise for all the wrong reasons although the only positive aspect about it is the clever usage of language.<br /><br />O my brothers, keep on peeting that chasha of real horrorshow cal.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|The best series on Rome I've ever read with very different and likable characters. This is the way Rome was thus it is for either adults or I would say young adults 17 and over. There is a lot of adult language, nudity, ( front and back ) sex acts, and violence. Nevertheless, it is the way Rome was and the depictions by the actors are nothing less than outstanding! Buy it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 10 year old son and I had a lot of fun with this game.  I wish it had more levels.  Great way to keep your mind active.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It was really good. I loved it. It was really really awesome.you must get it what made it better was it's free.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Keanu was perfect as leading man in the Matrix Trilogy....he does indeed what great actors must do to be great....suspends disbelief. A true timeless collectors item. I have no doubt Keanu could pull off another trilogy...Keanu is to sci-fi what Clint Eastwood  is to spaghetti westerns....a master.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|It was an a very good movie it has been watch ove and over along with the other sagas  glad I brought it
B007JNWQZS|5.0|Uma Thurman was perfect for the leading role in this 2 part movie. This is a timeless collectors item. The casting of the actors and roles they played was perfect.  No doubt Uma could pull off a sequel to this genre as she is to action what Clint Eastwood is to spaghetti westerns. Master.
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|We saw this film in the theater and found it even more lovely than we expected, full of extraordinary actors and dealing with the real issues many of us face in a sometimes hilarious, sometimes poignant way.  We knew when it ended that we would be buying it to see again and again.
B0037AGASG|5.0|Bought it for my 7 year old for his birthday, he wants to BE the next Justin Bieber, and he love this cd.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was fast moving and had a great twist at the end!  I have already recommended it to quite a few people.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|With each time I listen to this album, I start to love it more and more.  I wanted to much to like it at first that it left me feeling a tad bit disappointed.  But then I recall feeling this exact way with the prior two releases...Even the first time I heard them I thought there were only a few good tracks (Children Have the Right to Music) - to date, I love every minute of this album, as I do the rest.  This album is no different and I can already tell that I will love this in completely new ways and manners by the end of summer.  Amazing and so lucky to be living in this era of modern music (not being too old, not being too young).
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is pretty fun but it can be challenging because there isn't an option to get any hints.  Still not bad for free!
B0045OHUNM|5.0|She's young but she's brilliant.  I'm so lucky to not have died before getting a chance at hearing her works.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|One of my husband's favorite movies. Got it for him for Father's Day this year. Will enjoying watching it with him for a long time.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Yes I must say this is the best movie in the whole world!!!! I have watched it before I had gotten this film online and I must say It is a lot better on a t.v. =D
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Love this story. Disney rocks! Looking forward to enjoying this movie with my son for a long, long time together.
B0001AUAU4|5.0|There are only a couple of songs on the CD that are not excellent.  It's all in French of course, so she could be worshiping the devil or trying to tell my children to vote Democrat.  But it sounds lovely as she says it.  Well done Carla Bruni.
1781162646|4.0|I liked it and passed it along to friends with recommendations.  I hope King writes more of these.  Quick read.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|It started out funny with the first episode.  No long wait or disappointing beginning like Parks & Recreation.  Joel McHale is a stud.  Interestingly they find a lot of reasons to get his character to take off his shirt throughout the season.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It makes me feel like I have my own real living horse. Its like the horse I never had.
B008JFUOWM|5.0|Let Let me start by saying this move is awesome.  I'm an action buff and the more action a movie has the better.  I've been a big fan of Vin Diesel for a very long time and I've seen every movie he's made and I've been a fan from the very fist Fast and The Furious and I'll keep following them until the last one.<br /><br />This movie was great, I enjoy all the action and seeing all the character together again.  It was awesome seen Mia and Brian as parents to little Jake and us fans welcomed the new character with open arms.  However, there were things I didn't like in this movie was that Gal Gadot character (Gisele Yashar) died at the end and Vin Diesel left Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) for Letty (Michelle Rodriguez).  I know that Letty and Dom have a history, but he was with Elena know, why did they have to bring back Letty?  I hope that on Fast and the Furious Elena come back and fights for Dom.  She gave up on Dom to easy and to fast.  Awesome movie, I give this movie ********** (10) stars.  I can't wait for Fast and the Furious 7.  I hope it's as awesome as the last ones.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Intros should be catchy and ease listeners into the tracks that follow. While On Sight was definitely attention grabbing, it made me not want to listen to the rest of the tracks. So what did I do? I shelved Yeezus. A few days later, I decided to give the album another chance. So i put in the CD, and forced myself to listen to the album all the way through. When I got to Blood on the Leaves, I found myself pressing the repeat button numerous times. I'm not sure what it is about that track that grabbed my attention, whether it was the sample, the beat, or how I have never heard a soul sample combined with a beat in that fashion. I'm not sure what statement Ye is trying to get across with this album, let alone this track. Maybe he is trying to show how African American men are still subject to slavery, but in a different form. In the context of Blood on the Leaves, I think he is saying that African American men are held captive by their sexual desires which causes them to commit adultery. Their desires cause them to act hastily, and usually result in the impregnation of their mistresses. Faced with the news of the pregnancy, he must inform his wife, and will eventually end up going to court at least once to settle child support, or twice to get divorced. (Similar to Tiger Woods?) After both lawsuits are settled, the man is basically a slave to both parties financially, forced to pay alimony as well as child support.<br /><br />That's just my two cents on the track, only Kanye knows what this is supposed to mean. However, it is very dark. Like the rest of this album. The subject matter comes at a surprising time in his life, at the verge of marriage and fatherhood, which are normally happy times for people. I think this album would have been more suitable for the time period in his life after the passing of his mother and his separation with Amber Rose, it would just make a lot more sense, which I guess is the problem. I think he purposely does the unexpected because hefeels like he needs to prove himself as an artist, even though he has the respect of many musicians. While the beats are pretty strong, the lyrics seem very lethargic on some tracks. Misogyny is still a very prevalent theme which I hope will disappear in his works in the future due to him having a baby girl which should alter his views on women. Like 808s, the album is revolutionary in the sense that it will keep other artists on their toes, looking for new things to incorporate into their upcoming projects. Before listening, I questioned his guest artist choices however, he always seems to bring out the best in them.<br /><br />All together, I would give Yeezus a 84.5/100. While it was a above average album, I feel like his previous works were more than just above average. I know that musicians can never stay on the top of the charts forever but Kanye is an artist, and while I expected more from him, I was not completely disappointed. If this album came from any other musician, it would most likely garner better reviews because excellence is not what is expected of them. A+ is expected from Kanye, however this album was a B at most. Another factor that could be affecting his music is his lifestyle. Many of his previous works were fueled by his shenanigans, presented in a way that was enjoyable and laughable. Now that he has his act together for the most part, it seems like there is nothing very interesting in his life for him to talk about so he has to make social commentary, which if not done properly, is boring. Hopefully something interesting happens in his life which he can reflect in his upcoming albums but until then, people will continue to try to analyze Yeezus.

So I can't say how well it worked since it didn't!
B004QPUGRW|5.0|Mr. Swenson briefly gives an overview of Ashtanga Yoga as well as its history in the United States from his perspective garnered as one of the first generation of Ashtanga students of Sri Pattabhi Jois back in the 70's. Ashtanga Yoga - The Practice Manual adequately explains breath (Ujjayi), lock (Bandhas), flows(Vinyasa), gaze (Dristi) and posture (Asana) - the fundamentals of Ashtanga. The greatest feature of this Manual is a variety of alternatives for each asana; it simply makes Ashtanga more accessible to everyone according to their strength and flexibility. This fine final product shows that many key ideas are carefully incorporated into its production and planning, including how the book will be used and who will be reading it. Thick, durable sheets of paper in the spiral bound format that can be easily opened answer the former. Practitioners of all skills are a focus of the latter. The text is well organized. The step-by-step of each asana is numbered, and each number and text is bolded. The pricing is reasonable. The author is realistic in his attitude, not being too dogmatic that he allows his practitioners to use, with some caveats, props in some difficult poses. (In general Ashtangis are type-A personality. Some are even more intolerant and stricter than others.) The book covers both the Primary and Intermediate Series.<br /><br />Despite having given all of essentials of Ashtanga Yoga in this printed format, Mr. Swenson somehow does not include the opening and closing chants. This minor shortcoming still makes The Manual \\"The Manual.\\" If you can afford only one or two books on Ashtanga, this is one of them. You can always google and print out the mantras and add that page to your copy of Ashtanga Yoga - The Practice Manual. By the time you are halfway proficient in the Primary Series by practicing the sequence with a continuous flow without thinking what comes next, you will have then, too, recited the mantras by heart.<br /><br />He does his homework well. Five stars, as a result.ell. Five stars, as a result.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes you think, you have to be in detective mode to play! I love finding the clues and putting them together to open the doors! Fun and challenging.
B004AM5QT4|5.0|This Ken Follett novel was another exciting read combining science this time, instead of history, with an a complicated, challenging structure plot to ensure your interest.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|I am more of a fan of  Sarah Vaughn,  and Ella Fitzgerald,.and If I must pick a male singer it would be Mel Torme. Rod has one thing over these...He's still alive.
030789701X|5.0|I have never encountered a more thorough and complete guide.  Aside from being nicely put together it also includes codes to get the supplementary digital content and the interactive map on Prima's website.
0307271080|5.0|You need to read everything by Adichie. It's that simple. She is, indeed, the heir apparent to Achebe. Rich, complex characters in a world that is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a fairy tale. From the moment I read &#34;Purple Hibiscus,&#34; I have become a student of Adichie's work. I can only hope and pray that this is simply the next in a long line of modern canonical works by this supremely talented author.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book, I\\"d read them all again. I am glad they got back together, they had some crazy times. Wow
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I chose this book because the movie version is coming out. Now I'm not sure if I want to see the movie because the book was SO good & I hear the movie is different from the book. The author uses an interesting (but easy to follow) way to tell the story...which is riveting. And the story is told from such a variety of points of view that you really get a feel for what happens. I highly recommend this book!
B00992CF6W|4.0|ids fun and and all that but they hardly update it I mean its still on 0.8.7 and computer is at 2.1.2
1781162646|5.0|Excellent book.  I enjoyed the different style of story telling. Worth the read. Add it to your summer reading list if you're a fan of SK.
B008MM9630|5.0|Good game for girls. This needs a help or information button to help explain more complicated potions and where certain items can be found
B002OSXDAU|5.0|No doubt the message will go over the heads of many, but for those who grasp Rand's concept explored in this book, the rewards are for a lifetime. Didn't want this one to end...
B000ICXQF6|5.0|I love this movie and I wish there was a happy ending... The story was good and kept you guessing until the end. The cast also did a great job but they could have made a better ending. Every movie should have a happy ending!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I think it is really cool. The only thing I want to play on<br />the kindle is this game.Its awesome!
0307887448|5.0|I'm a pop-culture junkie. Undoubtedly author Ernest Cline is as well, because Ready Player One is a cornucopia of movie, TV and especially game references. Someone could not write these things so in-depth without loving the source material.<br /><br />But this book is not just about the 80s; the world it takes place in is vividly painted. The future is not a pretty place unless you go virtual. Even then, there's a definite disparity between the haves and the have-nots.<br /><br />Despite giving away the main plot point very early and very obviously, Ready Player One keeps you on your toes throughout. I recommend it to just about everybody, and just thinking about it makes me want to reread it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Not something I usually read, but so glad I did! Fantastic! Loved the main character and couldn't help but to root for him. I laughed out loud many times!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Fun read that keeps you enthralled. Fast page turner. Eccentric, imaginative, interesting, weird, different, and I won't write another review since it HAS to be of a certain length.
0761172726|4.0|3 years ago i had one with pretty scenery but can't find one in the last 2 years so moms is ok and love the idea for a family like mine, but i'm a great grandma
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell Reflect is a great little game to spend an evening playing or to play while sitting in a doctor's waiting room. Uses your brain and keeps you on your toes!  The best 99 cents I've spent recently!  Get it, you will enjoy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loves this series. I wasn't going to read them, someone talked me into it and never laid the books down for more than a second. I look forward to reading more books from ms James. It's been a pleasure.....
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I have seen the show Love 3 times now in Las Vegas, and it just gets better each time.<br />This DVD/CD set contains essentially the sound track of Love, and the Beatles music never sounded better.<br />The entire suite of music for the show was arranged by the man who produced all of the Beatles original albums, George Martin, along with his son Giles.<br />The DVD in this set is in multi channel sound and really recreates the atmosphere of the show Love.<br />If you are a Beatles fan this is a must have.<br />If you are only slightly familiar with the Beatles, this will convert you to a fan.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|If you loved The Kite Runner you will enjoy this book. Well written and a beautifully told story.  Loved it!
B0015AARJI|5.0|It's a brand name PS3 remote, so there's not much I can say. It works, and it's black. And it's a remote.
B00C81AVNU|3.0|but not nearly as good as winning all those Tonys would indicate.<br />I do like Cyndi Lauper and Harvey Feirstein (sp?)
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|It was just what I needed and/or wanted. Works perfectly. I would recommend this product to anyone. I am using all four ports and see no slowness.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|In terms of automotive films, this is the best you'll find outside of the GT Racer documentaries. Picture and sound quality are superb for such an old film, and despite the barely there sub-plot, there is no other film about auto racing that comes close. It's universally accepted that the car chase in Bullitt is the best; this movie makes that seem boring.
B008220BLG|5.0|A very entertaining movie that really has a great message running throughout.  A great movie to add to the Zombie genre.
B009X01ELC|5.0|Just a handy and useful item. You can pivot the Kindle anyway you'd like. Close the cover and the Kindle shuts down. Open it up and the Kindle comes to life. You can pivot the Kindle so that when you close the cover the charging port is available to access. Stand up for easy viewing and manipulating. Nice feel of the materials used to make this case. The elastic strap can be used to keep the case closed, securely, and &#34;flips&#34; over and out-of-the-way, when you are using your device. I have bought one for a the 7&#34; Kindle and one for the 8.9&#34; Kindle. They, both, are very good investments that help to protect and carry around your device. I, highly, recommend this product!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this game is pretty fun when I'm bored, but I wish things in the game changed like different coins, trains or power ups.
1432794426|5.0|I really like this book. When I bought it on my nook I couldn't put it down. I learned a lot of stuff I didn't know. I think this book is great for all ages. New fans of Michael should read this book. They will learn about the court trial and how messed up it was. I wish Karen would do a second book all about Conrad and also the Aeg trial. Thank you Karen for your hard work. Michael would be proud. I know he is smiling down on you!!!
B00B04KVMC|5.0|Great recording, songs are making. Wish it had more songs from the recording session but truly a great sound. Must have to any vinyl collection! Made me buy more vinyl recorded at Sound City!
B00BOA9MVI|4.0|This book shows that even during times of great conflict, the human element still comes to the surface.  Highly recommended.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Like many others, this app refuses to download for me. I'm think it appears to be a problem only for Kindle Fires so if your using a Fire don't waste your time or memory. other than that I play Magic on Xbox and in person and its a great game :) dissappinted this doesn't work though :-/
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|My boys watched it and only thought it was ok.  They would not want to watch it a second time.
1781162646|5.0|I HAVE ONLY READ ONE OR TWO NOVELS OF THE 51 I OWN SO FAR THAT I DID NOT CARE FOR.  THIS IS A WINNER.  IT IS A SENSITIVE NOVEL AND TUGS AT YOUR HEARTSTRINGS.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  THE WAY THIS MASTER WRITER DESCRIBES THINGS MAKES YOU FEEL YOU ARE RIGHT THERE EXPERIENCING IT WITH THE CHARACTERS.<br />THE FORMAT IS DIFFERENT FOR HIM, AND HE DID STATE THIS IS HOW HE REMEMBERS READING AS A CHILD.  HENCE, THE PAPERBACK AND OLD FASHIONED COVER.
1607060027|5.0|I only waited 5 monthes for this.... I'm rating this I love it, because I do.... but y'all shouldn't advertise something, sell me something, and not have it in stock for 5 monthes.  This was a Christmas present at first and I had to go and get it for a friend (in the stores around Christmas, it was hell).  I bought it WAY before the holiday and you said it'd ship before the holiday.  Needless to say, I was unhappy.  So I took the credit you gave me and bought one for myself..... which I had to wait another 3 months for.  Very disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it is a really fun game. but it quit working nd now I. cant play it it is an ok game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Captivating...it is a good easy read..enjoyed this book immensely. i can't wait to read the rest of the series..I highly recommend it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book! The Percy Jackson series is the most interesting books I ever read . I read the books , Percy Jackson and the lightning thief, the sea of monsters, the last Olympian, and now I am working on reading the Titans curse. This was the first book I ever read on my kindle Fire, I would recommend this book  9 to 12 because there a lot of killing,and blood. My friend read this book and as she told me it was a good book I went straight to my kindle and bought it. Some of the three star  and two stars are reasonable, but other ones that say \\" I did not like this book don't get it\\" reviews are just nonsense. If you want to waste a couple hours reading, this is the book you should read.
B008YI91HS|5.0|This is one of the best films of the 1990's. it was a no-brainer to add it to my collection. Great cast, great story and fantastic dinosaurs.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Read It again again after NAS4A2 by Joe Hill. I'm so glad you two exist to write! Thank you so much!
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|This is one of the best live albums of all time. Great sound...great music. Paul McCartney and Wings will alway ROCK.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing book loved the end it was very happy yet sad at the same time hope you like this book as much as I have.
0374531269|5.0|Summer reading assignment at Cincinnati Moeller High School. Great story whole family read the book. The book will  be discussed  throughout the year.
B004E5D2M0|3.0|i love the movie, but the sound is so uneven i have to increase the sound or lower the sound all the time. again, no quality control
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great way to give your fingers a workout. In fact, I had a problem with my Kindle once and this was the only game I would play. BEST GAME EVER!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think you are going to like it  it was pretty good and it was really fast at loading the game would be good if you have kids
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This case worked just the way I wanted it.  It functions very well in both the horizontal and vertical modes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun, entertaining and provide a good workout for your brain!  I played until the battery died the first nite.  It can become addictive......in a good way!
076790592X|5.0|I've been missin out... why did i do that!!!<br />I absolutely dislike reading books, but this one... i somehow managed to finish 75 pages in 2 hours (i'm a 10 page per hour reader... go figure.)
B009C7JS14|1.0|Inconsistant forecast @ opening of tab. Does not ope rate as stated. Unknown forecast. Opens with old 12hr temperature forecast
0385342071|5.0|The first book I've been able to read front to back, within a few days, in years. Lighthearted, cute, sweet perfect beach read. Making me want to read again.
1592533868|4.0|Expected a lot more on Quilling, so was dissapointed in the book itself..it's more for card making than learning how to quill.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I actually loved this game. Kinda easy but hey it's fun. I would recommend it if your bored or even on a road trip.
0425252868|5.0|I just finished reading \\"A Higher Call.\\"  What a story--and so well written.  I am in awe of those who retain their honor and demonstrate compassion in the midst of the horrors of war.  Franz Stigler, the German fighter pilot featured in this book, was that very sort of hero.  He loved God and his country, disdained the Nazis, and respected the Allied pilots and airmen who flew against him.  Franz Stigler put his life on the line not only for Germany but also to uphold his belief in the value of life for all.  Had his efforts to protect Charlie Brown and his B-17 crew been revealed to Nazi authorities, Stigler would have been executed.  Charlie Brown, his crew, and their families owed a great debt to Stigler and the code of honor he shared with many German pilots.<br />  The tale itself is mind-gripping.  But Adam Makos can be thanked for his extensive research and excellent writing, which fully absorbed my attention during the time I read this book. His description of a crashed jet on fire, the pilot within struggling to escape as his clothing and flesh caught fire--I felt as though I held my breath the entire time it took to read that episode.  I cried more than once while reading \\"A Higher Call.\\"  I am grateful that Mr. Makos had the interest and persistence to bring all of this to print.  For him it was a labor of love that lasted for years.  It was well worth the effort.<br />  My dad was a B-24 pilot, the same age as Charlie Brown.  He flew his share of missions over Germany.  Ironic, isn't it, that my dad also flew with his rosary in his pocket, just like Franz Stigler did.  My dad also survived his service and returned home to a good life in the USA, his country that he had fought to protect.  He later found himself working alongside a few former German servicemen who had emigrated to the USA.  One of them introduced himself to his new co-workers by proudly passing around a photo of himself in Hitler Youth attire, not realizing these men were all WWII US veterans.  Some of them didn't react too kindly.  But my dad laughed and soon became that man's best friend.  Like Franz Stigler and Charlie Brown, my dad knew that it was past time to set aside any fears and prejudices related to the war, a tragedy brought about by the madness and greed of a few.  The real \\"winners\\" of any war are those like Stigler and Brown, and my dad, who fought well, cherished their fellow troops and respected their opponents, and graciously moved on to peace-time without harboring ill will toward anyone, in spite of the horrors they had experienced.  Those are our greatest heroes.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|Dont waste your time. There is so much going on at once you cant even see how you play. Its galliga meets tron minus the entertainment.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am a recent convert to this series.  I was able to watch the prior seasons thanks to being a Prime member and now I can`t wait for season four.  You become very vested in each of the characters since the acting is so superbly done.  If you have not been a fan, be sure to get all the seasons!
B005LAIIN0|4.0|If the only reason you are planning on seeing this movie is to see the book onscreen then don't bother.  The two have little in common beyond the title. However if you want to see a good zombie flick that is well written and acted then see this movie.  This film does an excellent job of showing the true scope of the devastation worldwide without being overly gory which is quite a feat as most directors use the excuse of 'I'm making a zombie movie' to up the blood and violence and ignore the plot.  After all, it's just a zombie movie.  Now I don't mind gore and violence but found, to my surprise, I didn't miss it here. There are a lot of genuine suspenseful and terrifying moments. Terrifying because they felt real.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes zombies and likes suspenseful movies. Popcorn movies don't have to be brainless.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|After waiting for months for the third book in this series to  be published, I can't believe it ended leaving all the readers in suspense to find out which son has survived this deadly crash.  Now I have to find out how long it will be before the next one comes out.  I've really enjoyed these three books by Jeffrey Archer and thought it was only going to be three books.  Disappointed to have to wait!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great movie--glad I was able to find it here.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Excellent movie with endless action and thrills.  Was on the edge of my seat from start to finish.  The main characters (Hansel and Gretel)did an amazing job and were delightful to watch. I usually am not a fan of these types of movies but took a chance and am glad I did. Definitely, would not recommend for children due to the profanity (however, well done with humor and unoffensive) and very graphic content.
B00CW665VI|5.0|LOVED this book! It was a fantastic story, and the steamy parts were very well done! I couldn't put it down once I started reading. Can't wait for more from this series!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room is a puzzle game with beautiful graphics and great user interface. I was disappointed with the ending of the game as it seemed very abrupt, but the gameplay was still fun and challenging.  I look forward to other installments of The Room.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I loved this book. Delirium and Pandemonium sucked me in, and I was thrilled to have the continuation of the story! It didn't play out exactly as I had thought it would, which is always the best! Now if only the story could continue...
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Well acted and good story but sometimes hard to watch, the characters where pretty intense for most of the movie, shouting and arguing, which was necessary do to the mental condition of the actors but became a little tiresome. The movie was worth watching and I did enjoy it.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|This is the second CD of Bruno Mars that we have bought and enjoy his music very much.  My wife really enjoys his music.
B00000IZOR|1.0|Bought this for little one when he started picking up our phones to say hello, however this phone is nearly impossible to pick up as cord is sooooo short.  I just wish it was long enough for it to reach his ear.  When he picks it up the entire phone dangles mid air.  Everything else works just fine.  Wish I had researched this more in the store before I bought one.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|Like Bruno Mars.  Like the music.  We have bought other CD's of Mars and found this one very entertaining and will buy more.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|This movie ties everything together from the first (BEST!) movie wonderfully, and offers lots of places to talk to kids about decision making and how it affects those around us. There were some scarier moments that had my 10, 7, and especially 4 year old hiding their faces. I would still recommend it for those with older kids (older than 7), but prepare kids first.
B00005JLEU|3.0|The animation is impressive....and it is creative.  But, there is something slightly off-putting about it.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's just a bit too strange to really enjoy. Just my opinion.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|Very versatile take it EVERYWHERE! The rotating action makes reading or surfing web easy from any angle. I would highly recommend this case to everyone who is on the go & needs to protect their Kindle HD.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was very interesting for professional women who need a little peep in the step in terms of moving forward in your career.  Thought she spoke from a realistic viewpoint and gave some great examples of how to lean in.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game if I were the person that build this game should give<br />Me all the updates<br />This is the best game ever but it won't update
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is great, with awesome graphics.  One of the few out there you can play, and advance without spending money!!  Highly recomendedw
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was shown this game by my daughter and was immediately hooked, I then got it and never looked back.  I enjoy the different places that you have to interact with. My only quibble and its only small is there is never enough time to collect the little emblems of the places you are at and that's when they appear.
0783225547|5.0|Love the movie, it is one of my favorites!!  Would watch over and over and over again if I had the time.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The complexity of family relationships makes for a novel worth reading. The love of family transcends the difficulty of surviving in the world.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Enjoyed every chapter of every book. Most points it was hard to put down. Great idea to get all 3 books so I could continuously read
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Sad, but not as hard to read as I thought it might be.  Difficult subject handled without gratuitous violent details, while still driving home the reality of the utter cruelty these people had to endure in their unfair lives.
B002JVWRAO|4.0|OK I watched this series in the very early days and was bored. The acting was passable but the scripts seemed formulaic and yawningly easy to predict. Things have changed. I couldn't understand this series popularity until I watched the fifth season--wow. The plots are clever (even epic) and the repartee is witty--chock full of pop cultural allusions that can be laugh out loud funny and the acting has improved. Well done-- and good show for all horror fans.
0756404738|4.0|sent to my son he loved it and I will continue to send him similar books in the future... peace
B00B89WXYS|5.0|i absolutely love this cd because i love one republic.  they are awesome.  the cd and case were in perfect condition
B00CWY76CC|5.0|In each level the puzzles get more difficult to solve to find the &quot;keys&quot; to escape into the elevator and on to the next floor (room).
B007HO392S|5.0|this is an awesome cd.  carrie underwood is just amazing.  the cd and case were in excellent condition when i received them.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I received a copy of the game for the iPhone and despite the small screen I have played it for hours on end.  Just found it for the kindle, guess what...... been playing since I found it.  Great entertainment all around.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It had twists and turns that I didn't see coming and I always like that.  Great cast too.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Lots of guns i play it a lot when i am doing nothing it is a lot fun just like the real thing
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Interesting book. Gave me a good feeling to imagine my parents in a beautiful place as described in this book.
B001U7WUW8|5.0|I remember when this album came out. I was just 13 years old. And it was my first CD I bought on my own. I think this is a timeless classic. My favorite album of Green Day. Takes me back to my youth as a teenager. The songs are so catchy. You can't stop singing to the lyrics. And there was no scratching or skipping. Plays smoothly. And has good sound quality. Happy to be available in Vinyl. Another addition the my record collection. I'm so happy it was available when I searched for it. I got the last 1 in stock. So I feel honored to have it. Again Thank you Amazon you are truly the best store online.
014241543X|1.0|When I first started this book I was very excited to read it because everyone seemed to love it. I started to read it but after a couple chapters I realized that it wasn't getting better. It took me forever to read this book and it usually only takes me a few days to read books, but I just couldn't bring myself to read it. I do not recommend reading this book. Although it is a creative and interesting topic, it is poorly written.
B004Q3RKH8|5.0|I really love this album by Pearl Jam.  I got it in the vinyl format not the CD. And it arrived on time, and plays smooth. No scratches or skipping. Good sound quality. I listen to it everyday since I got it. The songs are addicting. You just want to play the song's over and over again. My favorite song off the whole album is Corduroy. Very pleased with my purchase. Is well worth the money.
0345529057|5.0|My son who never, ever reads books is devouring these!  We have watched all the GOT episodes on HBO and are now reading the books.  So far so good!  Happy to have the books to go to in the &#34;off season&#34; from the TV series.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I was shocked when I opened this box set. I got it in vinyl records not  the CD. Every Beatles album is in this box set. This is a happy addition to my record collection. So far I haven't had any problems with the records. Plays smoothly and little to no skipping or scratching. If you love The Beatles than this box set is for you. I feel honored to own this collection. You will fall in love with the Beatles if you own this collection. Again Thank you Amazon for making this available. Well worth the money. Money well spent.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A quick, worthwhile read. It was extremely insight ful and I probably will come back and read it again because of how excellent it was.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very challenging but a LOT of fun me and my son enjoy playing together.  good quality time together and helps him think outside the box
B00335EQ0E|5.0|This is a great movie!! The discs were in great condition, just as promised by the seller!! I totally recommend this one!
B007RTAR64|5.0|Bought this for a granddaughter for Christmas.  She loved it, especially, since Santa brought her a bow and arrow for Christmas.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|This is a great show!! The discs were in great condition, just as promised by the seller!! I totally recommend this one!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Somewhat challenging. Had to use YouTube for help. Had a great time playing though.  Can't wait to play again.<br /> Music gets annoying too.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This is a great movie!! The discs were in great condition, just as promised by the seller!! I totally recommend this one!
B003IY48PS|5.0|Since the chances for a Criterion reissue of this are slim, i was wondering if anyone knew where i could find the version of this that had the all the extras on a separate DVD?
B0019CSXAM|5.0|This is a great show!! The discs were in great condition, just as promised by the seller!! I totally recommend this one!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app is lots of and quite challenging. i was so into it that i lost time playing. I can't wait for more.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is a great movie!! The discs were in great condition, just as promised by the seller!! I totally recommend this one!
B00APYKXFS|1.0|hard to control, crashes a lot, bad graphics. disappointing compared to the description and screen shots. a definite thumbs down.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This is a Wonderful season!! The discs were in great condition, just as promised by the seller!! I totally recommend this one!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had a lot of fun figuring out some rooms and even had to stop for a few hours so I could find the solution.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Very nice. Easy to see. Big bold colors. I use to play this game with my mom and grandma but couldn't play long cause my eyes would start crossing and blurring. With this edition I don't have that problem.
1400052181|4.0|This is an undertaking to explain the beginnings of HeLa cells widely used in medical research coupled with the story of the woman whose cells were used for experimentation without the permission of the woman or her family members. Rebecca Skloot, the author, provides the results of months--years--of research into medical records and interviews with the medical personnel involved  harvesting Henrietta Lacks' cells. Interspersed in the narrative, the personal lives of Henrietta Lacks and her family unfold with candor and respect for the very rough road they traveled in attempting to cope with segregation, aborted educational opportunities, poverty, and folklore explanations for the events in their lives. I would recommend this book as a text for aspiring journalists.
B002ECN4P0|4.0|I bought the album mainly to listen to some of their type of music. These guys have been around for ever it seems. But over all their music is a little loud for me, I am a Frank Sinatra or Diana Krall person.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Animated film that look like real people. Great story line and fun to watch. Good family movie to see. Recommended.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|When I saw slender I thought \\"OH S***\\" I  got 7-8 pages . Over all its FANTASTIC and you have to buy it
B009R659L8|4.0|Excellent book. I hated having to put it down. The ending was a very unexpected twist, with a great finale
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Liked this game, the story line was good, and the graphics was great.  It was nice that I got to try it out for free.
B005VPRF9I|4.0|All I know is my grandson loved it and seemed to be familiar with everything in the set, so I am glad I got it for him!
B00006J3WH|5.0|Good music, and I  follow the episode in my head as I listen.  Music added is nice touch. Joss Whedon rocks!
B00280LYIC|3.0|Amazing and outstanding:plain awesome the book is amazing I loved every deferment chapter everything about this book thank you so
0451197968|5.0|I just meant to pick this up and glance through it in passing. Next thing I know I've skipped three classes and have to finish it. Be careful when you start this thing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|super fun game. I like it and it challenges you to use both brake and gas! just make sure you don't break your neck!
0345404475|4.0|Blade Runner and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep are two entirely separate beasts. Both are remarkable and both question what it means to be human but there the similarities stop. Read the book and watch the film or vice versus as both are enjoyable.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I never got to watch this when it was out and I am so happy I can watch this free with my Amazon Prime.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game was very intelligent. it made my four year old understand how to take care of animals. she loves it. she has three horses. all brown except one. which is white. I love this game. it helps her out a lot.  we even have a bunny now. you should get this game. who cares it is free. Bahama.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|The story was okay, it was not one of my favorite Lee Child books. I was half way through the book before, it really got interesting.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|This works like a charm.  No issues at all and it is much faster (obviously) than wireless networks.  I recommend it to anyone with a Macbook Air or the new Pro's
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I read this book back in high school in the early 1970s but I don't think I had the maturity to grasp the concept back then, although I remember it making an impact upon me.  I just finished reading it again, 40 years later, and I'm so glad that I did.  This is such a thoughtful book about life and our perceptions.  It's profound and I feel, has many hidden meanings.  It made me think about life and time and what we chose to do with what's been given to us.<br />The author is compelling, the story line is interesting and captivating.  Billy Pilgrim is quite the character in so many deep ways.  I read this so quickly, which is usually not the case for me!<br />I think it will bring new meaning each different time it is read.  His &#34;time travel&#34; almost made me wonder what it might feel like to have Alzheimer's - his changing perceptions of life, lucid at times, then confusing. Overall, this is an excellent book, it's a classic I would highly recommend, and I feel that it holds many deeper meanings about life.  Enjoy!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I enjoy this game.  You can have your own farm, buildings, houses, animals, and so forth.  My only complaint is every little increase you get in experience it pops out this little slider bar, and sometimes when you're trying to do something you can accidentally choose it and then it takes you to the web or other screens.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Great CD - Not as exciting as other works of Rod's, but these songs are soft and wonderful to listen to.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|Gah. The hype machine and Mustaine's spewing mouth hit overdrive puking out nonsense about this one. It's another in an increasingly long series of ok albums from Megadeth. Rust In Peace is still their high water mark and this is more towards the lower end of the spectrum, maybe along the lines of a bit lower than Endgame and So Good...
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is not the type of book that I normally read, but every once in a while I break out of the mystery genre and stretch my legs a bit. I'm so glad I picked this book to read, as it kept my attention while taking my imagination on a thought-provoking journey. It was an easy, page-turning read and I was a little sad to see it end.
B003TML0VO|5.0|He is a lot heavier guitarist on these songs than his usual fare, and I think that is why he made it. He could stretch out on these songs without preconceived notions of how he is supposed to sound. However, he didn't do anything spectacular on these covers and they sound like a professional cover band did them all, especially since he brought in all the star vocalists.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|it was enjoying and held my interest all the way to the end. Thanks again P.C. all your books were good reading.
0486475824|5.0|Excellent condition. What a treasure. A real keeper. Am glad that it is required reading in my AP english class.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging escape game for those who love puzzles.  I'm officially addicted and can't wait for more levels. Bring it on.
B00AFOS6P2|4.0|However, this is not what I would call his best work. I find the shot of his bedroom and nude wife interesting artistically, but the first time I heard the disc, it sounded dull and droopy to me. On repeated listens, it improved immensely and the aim of what he was trying to do came though much better. This is still no &#34;No More Shall We Part,&#34; the high water mark for Cave and one of the best records released by anyone, but it is still relevant and vibrant music, albeit passionate in a slightly different fashion.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Wonderful, would it be possible that Gaiman keeps being the greatest storyteller? As usual, a beautiful story, emotional and magical. The only thing I didn't like was that it was too short, there is stuff that I'd love to know more about. Hopefully he'll come back to this story storyline in the future. Thanks for the dreams Gaiman.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I thought I would take several days to watch this, but once I started it I couldn't stop. It was like a good book. And I found out some things that I had some misconceptions about, like the real reason they let Don Felder go, (fired). I don't like Glen Frey as much now and appreciate Don Henley a little more.
B003IY48PS|5.0|Before \\"Spider-Man,\\" Sam Raimi started off as the director of the classic fright film \\"The Evil Dead,\\" which, to this day, is one of the hippest horror films ever.<br /><br />Ash, his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, and his friends Scott and Shelly head out to an isolated cabin in the woods for some fun. But right from the beginning, strange things happen. Cheryl hears voices howling \\"Join us!\\" And then, Ash and Scott find a recording of a ritual from a book called The Book of the Dead. Too bad for them, because that ritual releases soul-hungry demons who possess everybody in the cabin. The only way to stop the demons is through the act of bodily dismemberment, and it's up to Ash to return the demons to their resting place. However, it's not gonna be easy.<br /><br />\\"The Evil Dead\\" can be very scary, but it's mostly great fun to watch due to its shameless amount of gore. This movie goes so over the top, it sort of becomes comic, and I dig that.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell has created such an icon out of Ash, a character who has lasted through 3 films. Campbell is a master. The other cast is very good with Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl, Hal Delrich as Scott, Betsy Baker as Linda and Sarah York as Shelly.<br /><br />\\"The Evil Dead\\" is a movie done with so much love for the genre, and a movie like that only comes once in a while. Hilariously gory, well-acted, and great fun to watch on a nice Halloween night, a horror movie like this doesn't get any better. A classic!<br /><br />This movie is a must own for any horror fan.
B005ETANC2|5.0|Still scares me today!!!! Great movie, Sci Fi from the 50's. If you saw it at the Alpine in Orby, you understand.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best highbrow &#34;soap opera&#34; that has ever been made.  I am filled with anguish when I am done with each season as the anticipation for the next season starts. . . and I don't even watch TV!
B0012GMXSS|3.0|This is a project that was one of [singer Mark] Lanegan's earliest, I believe and it nowhere lives up to every other thing he's done since then. All of his other projects are better, from QOTSA to the collaboration with Isobel Campbell to his solo stuff to Soulsavers and on and, unless you really like the radio single &#34;Nearly Lost You&#34; or are a huge Lanegan fan, best to seek one of those others.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This is a very strange story, with a lot of surprises. I recommend it, but I didn't find it as uplifting as the title may suggest.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Jurrasic Park blew me away.  I watched it last night. It was one of the most thrilling movies I have ever seen.  The 3D is flawless.  It was like it was meant to be in 3D.  There is a feature with Spielberg, who said, he saw what they did with Titanic and he asked the same people to do Jurrasic Park.  He said that when he made the movie, in a way, he as thinking in 3D, yet at the time it was in its infancy stages. Not that he thought of it in 3D, but looking back he said he saw all the way he shot the film with angles and distance.  I found it to be enthralling and one of the most astounding 3D movies ever made.<br />Looks like it was shot in 3D.  And not just a lame conversion at all.  The music is still fantastic.  Everything about it is what real entertainment is all about.  Even after all these years, it was as new and fresh as the day it was released.
0345529057|5.0|I love the show, and I love the books even more! The books fill in any gaps in the storyline from the show, and give you insight and backstory into each character. Very well thought out, and exciting. I especially like the character dynamics, as well as the shocking and unpredictable storylines. Can't wait for the rest of the books to be released!
0525478817|5.0|After seeing so many people rave over The Fault In Our Stars I finally decided to take the chance on it and see what it was that had everyone so in love with the book. I have heard so much about it that I went into with a sort of preconceived notion as to what I was going to be given. I was almost completely wrong. I now understand why so many reviews seem to skim over what exactly is in it...and I feel like I should do the same. It's a book that you need to experience on your own to full appreciate and I don't want to rob anyone of that experience.<br /><br />The Fault In Our Stars is a book that deals with cancer, but Green has written it in such a way that you don't really feel that gloom and depression the way you would with a \\"normal\\" (what Hazel would call) 'cancer book'.  It's a book filled with hope, humor, snark, and sadness; and I don't see everyone who reads this reacting the same way. I've read very few books that have managed to make me laugh and then crush my heart with expert precision, but this is definitely one of them.<br /><br />When I first picked this up I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, the style and voice is rather distinctive and it definitely  didn't fit into the shape I had made in my head. Hazel has a very unique voice and personality, and it took some getting use to but once the story got moving I was hooked. The flow of the story is quick and I loved the realness of the conversations which are not perfect in form or generic. The conversations have character and you really can see their personalities hinging through in their wit and charm. The characters are really well developed and surprisingly I loved them all, and even though the cards are stacked against them I found myself rooting for them from the very beginning. If I had to choose one thing that I loved the most from this book, as impossible as that feels, I would go with the fact that it is not a book centered around death but instead it's centered around life. There is something really raw about the hope and love in this book and it just settled into my heart.<br /><br />The relationship between Hazel and Augustus is hard to explain. It's not a whirlwind romance and it's not some flat thing produced on a whim, it just feels real. There is a sort of unique bond that forms between them, and some of their conversations are my favorite parts.<br /><br />The Fault In Our Stars is not an easy book review and it's certainly not one I could accurately describe to someone quickly. I had so much trouble trying to find the right words while at the same time leaving out spoilers, and I still don't think I managed to quite capture it. It's my first John Green book but it certainly won't be my lastmething really raw about the hope and love in this book and it just settled into my heart.<br /><br />The relationship between Hazel and Augustus is hard to explain.

B005OCFHHK|4.0|Not sure why, but the fast forward is not allowed, and when I wanted to skip all the credits and go to the cast of caracitures all I got was warnings in all different languages, that did not make me happy. And seeing as how I'm only up to book 5 I haven't finished watching all of them.
B008DVJO8C|3.0|There is nothing wrong with this album, but nothing to make it a classic, either. It is a great success story and good for the band for selling so much of it, but I'd be surprised if it's remembered 2 or 3 years from now, let alone 20. Brink is a powerful siren and she cuts loose and belts and wails for almost all of this album. The production, which is really what is making this, I think, since the songs are a bit pedestrian and dull, is top notch and spot on. Ultimately though, once the wow factor of Brink's vocal acrobatics wear off, there's just not that much left.
B007REV4YI|5.0|played it and happy with it. Not like the 50 set box which most of it's Blue Ray CDs did not play due to region problem.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is great but every now and then I am &quot;unable to open this app.&quot; Other than that it is a fun strategic game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Excellent book just hate to be left hanging. Can't wait for the next one. I love the cross fire series.
0684823454|5.0|Churchill's account of his young life is relatively short for a man who did so much, yet it has attention to details and is quite engaging. I found that it's style of writing is unlike contemporary American writers of history, but in a good way. I had a hard time putting it down after the first few chapters. Easily something you could read in 2 days at the beach.
0756688701|4.0|My two year old son loves CARS and he loves this book.  He takes his time studying every page.  I'm taking off one star for the book design.  The thick front cover which holds Lightning McQueen makes the book unnecessarily thick and cumbersome...not good for travelling or the hands of two year olds.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works perfectly. Now I can keep my kindle plugged in and watch shows or play games in bed. So glad I found this cord
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too difficult, but just enough to keep you entertained!! I can't wait for new rooms, I hope they come out real soon!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great. My 6yr old and I like to play it together. Good for developing problem solving skills.
1558908382|5.0|While this has a dark subject for a sub plot (murderers) it is a pretty funny movie overall. Going home for a high school reunion, running into an old flame, getting a contract to carry out, and of course battling with Dan Akroyd. Nice.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game. Can't wait for more rooms coming soon! A couple of levels kept me guessing for awhile!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute game my 3 year old really likes it and thinks it's a good game. Still needs some help but enjoys it still. likes the different activities it has for him to do on it so overall a good activity game
B001QBC4AG|4.0|Pete Townshend and Universal have been so great about getting the Who's catalog out in Deluxe Edition, that it makes me want to cheer. This one was particularly high on my list, because I've come to LOVE the wave of Mono edition remasters that have been coming out. I'll leave others to review the music (I would agree that the original album peters out by the middle of side two), but there is certainly a wealth of bonus tracks here, and it's great to hear the original STEREO mix, as well as the Mono! The 1996 stereo mix was tamed, and it's nice to hear the original intent in all of it's (some reviewers will say) garish psychedelic glory. The ONLY letdown for me was that out of three versions of &#34;I Can See For Miles&#34;, they failed to include the original single mono mix, which, with the lagging of &#34;side&#34; 2 of the album, accounts for me docking one star from my rating.
B001MTENOC|5.0|I find this book fasinating...much more so that most of the NDE books; I am reading it for the second time.
1604597828|3.0|It's really by now a history book, which I bought by mistake, thinking I was ordering Strunck-White.  The strictures apply to the 1920s, and few newspapers or contemporary editors would follow it now.O
B008HK3XYK|3.0|It's okay for the price the material is a good quality but in order to charge my kindle I had to put the camara end in last. The web site viedo states to put the camera end in first. It doesn't have a hole to plug a charger in. I have started to set it sideways and it is starting to slide down.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|An upgrade for my daughter....she had the other, flashlight version of this, and it fell apart the day after she got it.  This one appears a bit more robust, and it makes the noise to boot.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly in Hi Def?  You bet - very shiny!  Okay, I have loved the show since I first saw it, and have pretty much worn out watching it on Netflix, and when my wife said &#34;Fathers Day Gift Ideas&#34; this was at the top of the chart.  Without a doubt, my favorite addition to my Blu Ray collection to date.
B005LAII80|1.0|I would not recommend to anyone. This movie really disappointed me because it left a lot of unanswered question & just wasn't good.
B00006JIA4|5.0|So glad I ordered this three CD set.  My favorite is the third CD but I love listening to them all.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've really enjoyed the quiet in depth family of Downton Abbey.  Its nice to dream of a different time and life style.  By third season you have bonded with characters and enjoy the growth of changing times.
B000A3VTT8|5.0|One of the best opera ever written by an opera composer. The production is superb, the orchestra and performers were great. I recommend this specific production to anyone.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Had the older version and needed to upgrade when I moved to Win8.  Functions the same....don't understand why the original wouldn't work with a patch, but hey, at least it was cheap.
B005VPRG10|5.0|Well, this getting to be hard to find version of the iconic TIE fighter was delivered and promptly put together and added to my collection.  I have to say it is far and away better designed than the ones I have from the older sets.  Great model for the price, and a beautiful addition to my Lego Original Trilogy collection!
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|I really love the music in game, and I now love to listen to it while playing other games. Very good for just a listen or to play games along.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, glad it wasn't so hard that I wanted to pull my hair out like some other room escape games, I wish there were more levels!
0887307280|5.0|As advertised.  Speedy delivery.  Product seems good.  No problems at all thus far.  Had for about a week, so will keep watch.
1439153663|5.0|This was the best book I read this year.  Our book club chose it.  It was so popular that we couldn't get it at the library.  I ordered it on fast shipment, but still had to wait 6 days to get it.  I am 81 years old and haven't sat up until 2:00 AM to read a book for years. I was able to lone to a neighbor and it is being passed around.  All reported loving the book................
0399226907|5.0|this board book is pretty small.  I didn't  read the info carefully because it's a little hard to read with all of the little flaps.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this game is really fun! my daughter loves this game she plays it almost everyday! and I hope you will too!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|quell memento has lived up to both of it's predecessors which have set high expectations for the third quell game..memento. these games have been the best I have ever played on a device. they r challenging..at first you may think &quot;this is easy&quot; but trust me they become more difficult. memento is a challenge for me which I like because there are unfamiliar elements which was what I was hoping for. I think in terms of difficulty..so far this one is the most..fallen tree games..you have have exceeded my expectations ..please continue making these quell games..and people debating whether yo spend two bucks on another scrappy game I promise..if you love puzzles..you will love quell..it will keep you entertained for hours..best two bucks I have spent..
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|The documentary is superb (especially regarding revelations about conflicts within the group) & I highly recommend it, even though I haven't even gotten around to watching the concert DVD yet.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This is some great blues music. Ran across him on one of our PBS channels one night and just had to have the CD. A very talented man and group.
B0028NSE3M|3.0|I owned this album about 40 years ago and remembered it fondly.  I bought the CD and was sort of disappointed.  While the music is good, I don't care to listen to it for any long period of time.
0486295559|4.0|This book was recommended by a Lit teacher to our daughter.  It is a fabulous story and Jane Austin does not disappoint.  Do your self a favor and get this book and read it.  You will enjoy the story.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|i got this app on july 5 and i got it at ten thirty in the morning and i played it that whole intire day thats how.fun it is and i had to get the full version and i did its that awesome the only thing i would.change is the price for the full version but everything else FANTABULOUS
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Perfect book for the man or woman working through the unconventional choices of work or family, and how you really can have both if you're willing to adjust!
B00APYKXFS|1.0|I am a big fan of the Star Defender series so I feel I have a pretty good idea of what constitutes a good shooting game. This is not one of them. I spent too much time avoiding the red objects(meteors?) and was not given enough breathing space to conquer my enemy. I agree with other players in that it was hard to tell the enemy from my own ship. I am glad this was a FAOTD.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Rather than a sprawling story with a dozen gods and its own mythology, Gaiman has set a cohesive and enjoyable story on a farm in Sussex. A great, quick summer read.
1416550534|5.0|I bought this book for my book club selection.  I had to read a few hours before getting into the plot, but once hooked - - I couldn't lay it down.  I highly recommend this reading.
0486406482|5.0|Seriously, What is not to love about Jane?  She is witty, and funny, and writes great stories.  Please do yourself a favor and buy this book because you will love this story.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This is an interesting book for those of us with some introvert tendencies.  I think its greatest value is probably in helping introverts understand that there is really nothing wrong with the way they are and that their personalities have advantages as well as the obvious disadvantages.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have always wanted print from anywhere in my home and eprint made this possible. Thanks for making this possible
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|My husband has recently bought me my first tablet. I have been having a lot of fun looking for my favorite games that are on my pc to install them on my kindle. I found myself getting frustrated when it came to finding an app for mahjong. It was a relief to come upon this one. It is a simple yet elegant game. You get to play the game in a variety of designs and formations against the clock or casually if you choose to you may subnit your score and time to the board to compare your performance with your fellow gamers. This is a must have to add to your gaming library.

B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Disney produced a &#34;Wizard Of Oz&#34; related movie decades ago that, while relatively imaginative, was not well received by the critics or the public alike. One would think Disney would have learned something from that experience.<br />Now, &#34;Oz, The Great And Powerful&#34; is out, also by Disney, and this new movie also misses the mark. Visuals and computer imagery are generally well done, but the movie suffers significantly from script and casting issues. There is also an attempt in the script to make the new movie more contemporary, but the effort misfires. Any &#34;magic&#34; associated with the original &#34;Wizard Of Oz&#34; movie starring Judy Garland is clearly missing from this movie. This might be an okay movie for kids, but we are nowhere near &#34;Movie Classic&#34; territory here!<br />This adult was keenly disappointed by &#34;Oz, The Great And Powerful.&#34;  Hopefully, you won't be disappointed by it, too.
B000286RNY|4.0|This movie is packed with lots of fun and theatrical magic. A must see for kung fu movie lovers around the world.
0810995522|5.0|My 9yo son read book one after a friend recommended it. He wants to read the entire series now. I love that he is interested in reading. The book is funny and has the main character making both good and bad decisions and we can talk about these decisions as a learning tool for him. Also, we've been able to point out different &#34;characters&#34; in our daily lives (&#34;That's something Roderick would do&#34; or &#34;What would Greg do here?&#34;) and that seems to work as a teaching tool.
B00650SSDU|5.0|I love this movie!  It's comical, but also grounded.  There are some bad cuts, but if you don't get caught up in the technical aspects, the story is great!
8172238479|5.0|It was a good read, not dificult and full of unknown information.  I would like to read some by this author.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I first started the story on tape in the car, then, since I reached my destination long before the story was over, I downloaded it.  To some extent, it was better narrated, when you could enjoy the rhythm  of the language and the vocabulary , but even it print the multiple and intertwined layers of the story were well worth the time. To some extent, Rowlings' descriptive powers reminded me of the Potter series, but otherwise there is nothing similar. It's fascinating to me that an author can write such a different genre.
030758836X|4.0|If you want to be engaged with a book for hours upon hours, pick this up. It is some of the strongest writing I've read in years, and deserves all the success it has received. In fact, until I read the ending, I thought it was one of the best books I'd ever read. The writing is tight and the characters are well developed. Gillian Flynn does an incredible job of what Chuck Palahniuk has pegged \\"Telling a lie, and then burying the gun.\\" At times, you will hate Nick Dunn. At times, you will empathize with him. Same goes for Amy Dunn. And at times, you will wish them both dead. That's just how engaging this story is. If it weren't for the ending, this would have exceeded Sharp Objects, just based on the writing alone. I will say one thing positive about the ending. I finished this book months ago, and the ending is still on my mind. I give this one four stars. If you want to read a five star book by Flynn, pick up Sharp Objects and prepare to have your mind blown by an intricately weaved plot with a stunning conclusion.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I cannot review as I have not played myself but my 5 year old loves the series.  The only complaint I hear is that she cannot choose to be a girl and it really bothers her.  She loves the game and gets better ever time.  She loves to read me her score and is learning how to read thousands too (yeah its educational ha ha)
B00AWBNNAG|5.0|You can build anything Lego makes with this app of Lego instructions. Just search for the item and follow the instructions!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book kept me reading it even though I knew it would not end well.  I want a hero and there was none.  The characters were without a spiritual moral compass.  Very selfish yet a fascinating read in how ordinary people can engage in evil.

B008G3N71W|1.0|I didn't like it. I might have gotten it all wrong. If so sorry. But isn't she  minor? Isn't it abuse?Garbage just sick ass garbage
0525952926|5.0|It was what my nephew wanted for his birthday. It came on time. I was able to get it sent to Switzerland and it arrived before his birthday. So everyone was happy. He's started reading it already.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|A lot of what I do on FB can't be done on this app.  I do a lot of pictures, videos, and things like that.  I don't play games so I can't speak to that feature.
0679805273|5.0|Tis book is classic Seuss and deals with growing up and moving on into sometimes scary situations.  We give it as a graduation gift often.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice game it's hard and easy at the same time just love it I have to have more soon I'm bummed till the next are out. Hurry waiting for more.thanx.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Breaking Bad:  The Complete Fourth Season with Bryan Cranston is one-of-6 of the BEST DVDs.  Marathon watched 1-5 seasons and am now in withdrawal waiting for Season 6 !
B004QXXAYK|2.0|This book was in very POOR condition. To pay $8.00 was crazy. It was a DISCARD for this very reason.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|IMPORTANT NOTE: Amazon mentioned that WorldCraft from Solverlabs was the free app of the day on July 3rd through their Amazon App Store Twitter feed.  I assumed it was a slight mix up and that WorldCraft would be the free app of the day later this week, but apparently Amazon is totally unaware that they mentioned the wrong app being the free app of the day and it appears now that WorldCraft won't be a free app of the day at all now.  Sorry for the confusion I might have caused about WorldCraft possibly being a free app of the day later this week.<br /><br />Today's Amazon App Store Free Paid App Of The Day for July 5, 2013 is Cubimania from The Hohng Company.<br /><br />This is a 3D Tetris-like game.  The object is to simply stack as many 3 like colored blocks next to each other either horizontally or vertically.  The game as it is now is playable.  The controls are somewhat poorly laid out on the screen and take a little while to get used to.  I also didn't like the fact that there are 2 yellow types of blocks instead of adding another color such black or orange.<br /><br />But the biggest problem with this game is that it is one of those games you will have totally forgotten about in a month if not sooner than that.  There was nothing to keep my interest in this game after I made it to Level 3.  There are no new special power cubes that destroy others around it like you would find in a game like Bejeweled.  Level 2 and 3 seem to be just a continuation of Level 1.  The graphics are below average.  The written text such as the \\"play again\\" and \\"stop\\" that appear after finishing the game look like an amateur programmed this and are hard to make out the words if there are colored cubes of about the same color in the spot where the text is printed.<br /><br />Another major problem with this game is the lack of being able to play this game \\"Chess\\" style like Tetris where the next piece is shown in advance while you are placing the piece falling on the screen. If it hadthis feature like Tetris does, it would give you a chance ahead of time to figure out where to put the following piece.  This feature being omitted takes away a good deal of the strategy element to a Tetris-type clone like this.<br /><br />Because the game is playable, but is below average in both graphics and playability and is one of those games you could easily forget about, I am giving this a 2 star out of a 5 star rating.
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|This series is the Sopranos of the roaring 20's. Nucky Thompson is Tony Soprano and it works perfectly. Best series on tv.
030789701X|5.0|This is best game guide I have ever owned. I have purchased every Prima guide for Skyrim and this is by far the best. The perfect companion to the original collectors edition guide. The hardcover is beautiful and the book itself is massive. A must have for any hardcore Skyrim fan.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game but I hats how it forces you to chose something like it foced me to play under a already made up name.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Brings back lots of memories from when I was a kid. Loved playing Mario! And this is just like it!
B00CAUH7UE|5.0|Fantastic insight into how as a giver you can open up more opportunites whilst living a rewarding life. A must read for any manager or leader
B00APYKXFS|1.0|The Amazon App Store free paid app of the day for July 6, 2013 is Techno Trancer from GIGA-RENSYA Inc.<br /><br />This game is another one of those retro inspired shoot em up type games.  This game is rather confusing to figure out how to play compared to other games of this type.  You have shields that come and go, but I have no idea what you do to acquire the shields.  Quite often the explosions are so bright you can't see what is happening around you and it is very distracting and hard on the eyes.<br /><br />Because retro looking shoot em up games have been done so many times before and since the game lacks instructions and is rather confusing to figure out and with so many distracting blinding flashes going off that cover a good portion of the screen making this game somewhat less playable, I have no choice but to give this game a 1 star out of a possible 5 star rating.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|This series is the Sopranos of the roaring 20's. Nucky Thompson is Tony Soprano and it works perfectly. Best series on tv.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|Another great cold steel knife added to the collection. Knife came razor sharp out of the box like always with coldsteel. Plan on using it this upcoming hunting seasons dont think ill b disappointed been using a carbon v master hunter given to me by my pa for the last couple years. Knife quality looks great as all the cold steel knifes i own gotta love cold steel and the price's on amazon.
B00APYKXFS|4.0|After playing this game for a while I decided that it is decent and can be a very fun time killer.  Other people are complaining that it was &quot;not what they expected&quot; but you have to rate a game for what it IS.  Not what you think it is from partially reading a description.  As for other people complaining about having &quot;to move too much to survive&quot; I can understand a game beeping too hard for people but don't let that effect the rating.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|This app is so much fun, and it promotes creativity.  Allows non-artists to become artists. I love spending time on this app and recommend it..  .
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed playing this game with my adult kids.  Very neat how the board changes every time.  Mind challenging, not boring.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|It's great and it goes very well with the movie itself. Can't expect much more than that from an action movie soundtrack.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|What a great movie. This one will make you laugh, then cry, and them laugh again. Great characters and a really awesome story.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I liked the introduction, for me it was an interesting point to begin with. It is encouraging also.<br />The book is easy to read and not too short, the way it relates the events is clear.<br />Maybe a more detailed index would be better to get a grasp of what is going on in each chapter.<br />Tesla was indeed well recognized in this book and inspire us to fight and give the best of us.<br />I suddenly became aware of my necessity to feed my imagination .
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like this dictionary dictionary  because if  I  need a word that I see in a book I know where to find it
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Bought these for 2 of my grand daughters and they loved them.  Just having the pink set for girls was a big hit!
B001ILFUDC|5.0|It is engaging right from the start with a great, fun story, and interesting characters that keep your eyeballs glued to the TV. Very few other Disney movies compare. A real treat.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0810983915|5.0|I cannot keep these books in my class.<br />The fact that my students &#34;borrow&#34; them is an indication of how popular they are, so I try no to be mad.<br />So as my copies wander away, I just replace them from the lovely vendors at amazon.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|Like everyone else is saying. How can you tell the enemy from yourself? They are the same and what is up with those red blocks? There are so many of them that you can;t avoid them and they destroy you the minute you touch them. Not a very thought out game.
1426308469|5.0|We gave this to our daughter for her 6th birthday. She LOVES dinosaurs! She enjoys reading this book and can read most words. Each dinosaur's name has the pronunciation at the bottom of the page which helps the adult too. ;)
B008X9Z37A|5.0|This Belkin Case was exactly what I was looking for to protect my new Kindle Fire and make it easy to carry. The price was reasonable and it fits nicely in the corners to protect my kindle from getting broken if my grand daughter were to accidently drop it.
030789701X|5.0|This book, beeing heavy as a brick, and filled to the brink with information, pictures, maps, tips and tricks for every Skyrim fan. This is a must have xD
B008AT9XOC|5.0|I debated on giving it a 4 1\2 solely on a technicality, this particular movie only gives the original ending to Little Shop. It is lesser known because in the original movie they changed the ending to something a little more brighter because the audience got upset during screening on how it concluded. What was once just a black and white and almost soundless recovered film footage extra in a dvd selection is now a full length color addition in this directors cut. However, with this particular one there is no option to see either ending, just the one. That is the only reason why I would give it a half. Then I realized this is such a great movie anyway so I came to my senses and said, &#34;five stars you are sir, and little Audry II!&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great game!!!! I just updated to 1.6.1on the cp and love the horses but I wish they would update this one
B0014KFV6I|5.0|I've loved Carole King for years!  Her songs bring back the me I wanted to remain and always ring true to life.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|This book captures your attention with details of action intertwined within the main story. GREAT READ! I highly recommend it!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|neat game. little hard to to move around sometime but is still a fun game. just got to remeber to keep yoirself fed
0440246318|4.0|I have read all Reacher books. can,t wait for them.  I am still debating about the ending ? But still love Jack
B009LY72LQ|3.0|I was disappointed in this kit mainly because it only comes with one wig and one pair of shoes.  Shoes were no biggie, because they could always get those from another doll.  But I can't find anywhere to just buy a wig.  I was hoping that I could buy one somewhere later, but they aren't anywhere (including the matel website).  That means you can really only play with one doll at a time.  Not as fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love IT!  fun for everyone.  best game ever.  love all the different breeds of horses available too.  may different places to keep your horse and horseware.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a good game for a few spare minute if you don't get so caught up that you let it frustrate you.  It hones your geometrical skills!
0547564651|5.0|Good book, easy to read. Highlights the importance of teaching character in classrooms. I would reccomend it to any teacher.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Been a Beatles fan since I was a child.  This digitally remastered version was a fabulous buy.  I downloaded it immediately and still love it every time I listen.
B001DHXT2U|5.0|Very good piece to the ongoing story for Marvel cinematic universe saga! Cannot wait to get iron man 3 and Thor !
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Once I started watching this, couldn't stop! I think my favorite series of all time. I normally don't purchase DVD's of anything, series or movies. But this series is well worth it. There are episodes I've already watched several times- It's just that good!
B00BZBEL4Y|5.0|This is, by far, my favorite rendition of Persuasion despite there being newer adaptations. Ciaran Hinds is exactly how I pictured captain Wentworth and Amanda Root is also very elegant as Anne. The supporting cast deliver extraordinarily nuanced performances -- it's like going to a master acting class. I've watched this so many times--it's fantastic.
B0084HJE0S|1.0|This book is basically a list of very high level features of HTML5 with absolutely no practical or coding information. It is as if it was written by a business analyst trying to justify why anew version of HTML was needed to a high level group of business executives who no nothing about software.
034580404X|5.0|I was satisfied with the used copies of these books. Since I purchased them during their heightened season, it was a great value nonetheless. The books were in excellent condition considering them being handled by a previous owner.
0385349947|5.0|I originally bought this for my college age granddaughter.  I wanted to read it first so we could discuss it after she did.  I was so impressed and moved I wanted to share it with all my granddaughters and other working women.  I really think all working women will recognize themselves and be encouraged/helped by reading  this book.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Kill Bill is one of those series that needs no review! It speaks for itself! Get it! Get it! You will not be sorry!
B002V092B0|5.0|This story of damage to the brain of a neuroscientist and its subsequent recovery through systematic  efforts by her is a unique piece of courage, methodical approach in completely recovering and her power of expression. She is an Artist-Scientist.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat, tears of joy and tears of pain intertwining. To finish mid sentence.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Very good read.  Couldn't put the book down at the end. Can't wait to read the next book in the series
B002O3Z50Q|4.0|The movie was not as good as I expected it to be. I think it was the accents or lack thereof that kinda threw me off. However, the movie arrived in good condition and played well.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|Good action movie. Danzel plays, as always, a very good performance. Sad that he dies at the end. Good movie to be entertained the weekend,
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love it. No I have something to waste some time with while I am taking my breaks at work, Yeah!
B00A83075M|5.0|this movie was but because it has been shown from my sister in law and we watched it together me and my son and he could have been more happier getting his own personal copy so I really think you guys for that those very enjoyable thank you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Suspenseful, keeps you guessing, easy to read but not too easy if you know what I mean. LOVED IT! Thinking of reading the other books by this author.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The game has a lot of fun for children and adults, great game to get some relax and emotion while having fun
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game.  I just thought I was addicted to my facebook games until I found this one.  There are always new quests to start so it is never boring.  I just need to get some friends on it.  I find myself waiting until I have energy to play more or buying diamonds when I can't wait any longer.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|This is a another clone of dopewars with some boat racing mixed in, kind of an odd combination but it is fun enough to play.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|From start to finish these books captivated me like no other has. It was as in a trance that could only be broken by finishing the final book.
B008LODRT8|4.0|Was right on track to complete the trilogy!  Love the series and will keep it in my library!  Good read
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I was disappointed. I got lost.  It jumped around. Was so looking forward to reading this book because his other books were great.
B001AR4K8K|5.0|A movie for all horror collectors even if it is sort of cheesy and campy. Movie came in perfect condition.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is perfect for all ages. The only downfall that I have is that I wish you could earn more acorns, rather than having to buy them. Other than that I love it!
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Loved this movie.  Had the opportunity to meet the two main characters at a comic convention.  They are outstanding.  Would recommend this movie to anyone interested in this style.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty fun and somewhat challenging.  Might look for more games like this to play.  Always good to help you use the your brain.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|The game is fair and I can tell you that it is not what I expected I thought that it was going to be like an MMORPG with no single player available
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I lost my father  to brain cancer at 23 years of age. I didn't shoot heroin and sleep around to get over it nor did I put my life in danger by back packing so unprepared. I gave up on this book around the middle of it. I thought it would be more like A Walk in the Woods or Eat, Pray, Love. It obviously wasn't.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't remember the last time I read an entire book on one night. These characters were very realistic. Kate is a strong, driven woman who doesn't fall weak in the knees to Drew' s typical male, smooth talking ways (every single woman in their 20s could learn a thing or two from Drew s prospective<br />here). You've got to love him though when he eventually figures it out. Funny, sweet and incredibly sexy book.
B005USZYDU|4.0|The ending came very quickly and left me expecting and wanting more.  I was surprised that there wasn't more suspense.
B009NY43NY|1.0|What a lackluster ending to the series. Shallow plot, extremely short, and there seemed to be no closure whatsoever with most of the characters
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game. My 7yr old and I played together.it challenged the both of us<br />She played on her Kindle and I on mine ,we shared some serious thinking moments
B00CWY76CC|4.0|KeepsTKeeps you thinking but too short.  Wish it lasted a little longer.  Perhaps more levels now to keep the interest going.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|I loved this the first time I saw it many years ago and it still makes me smile to this day! A wonderful, inspiring movie for the entire family!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Neil Gaiman is a terrific writer. The story was entertaining, but not captivating. If you want a true story book with captivating characters, read &#34;The Graveyard Book.&#34;
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I had only seen previews of the movie so did not have a sense of what this was about.  Such a strange and compelling story.  Now I want to see the movie!
B003UYUP58|5.0|Engaging and fascinating look into the history of cancer and the metamorphosis of the disease. Very readable with excellent writing.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|This game annoys you with everything.  The sound is annoying.  The playfieod size is too small.  Screen is constantly filled with crap making it difficult to see your ship  and the enemies .  Playfield is too small for how fast  game moves and how much your visibility is obscured.  Skip this one.
159463176X|4.0|Hosseini is a compelling writer, yet this is his least compelling story.  It is not quite as moving as his first two books, yet I read it all the way through, of course.
B00C2IGQBA|4.0|I have seen this movie over and over again and will never get tired of watching it. When i ordered the Blu ray Steelbook version of this I was blown away and when i received it not only is this a great collectors item but the special features are awesome!!!! I would highly recommend this to everyone who likes Batman and who like myself knows that Michael Keaton is and always will be the BEST Batman PERIOD.
B000VDDDY6|3.0|I can remember Star Trek before it actually hit the air. I was just a kid, but saw a TV Guide featuring the Enterprise orbiting a planet and remember thinking this was going to be right up my alley. In other words, I was a Trecker before the series even premiered!<br />The remastered works have their charms, but this set is a bit on the cheap side. They don't charge as much though, so it is a trade off. I do miss these series, all of them. The new movies just aren't the same. No message of a hopeful future. No history, No substance. I fear Star Trek is past.
B00C6B7V58|3.0|My copy arrived in a plain padded envelop and as a result it had some paint chips and a few dings.<br />Amazon eventually gave a refund, but it's not that nice to own a damaged copy. Other that that, it's a nice steelbook. Shame it lacks inside artwork.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|This is a must have classic.  It is my husbands favorite all time movie.  I bought it for Father's Day and he wanted to watch it right away.
0425263924|4.0|I can't wait for the next book in the series.  Syliva Day gets her point across and still keeps the mind wondering.
B000FC146C|5.0|The Thorn Birds is definitely one of my favorite books of all time.  I know I will keep reading and re-reading it many times!
B00795P4EG|3.0|I think this app would be great but seems I can only use it with pictures from my kindle camera which is very hard to use as you have to hold it backwards and is hard to see what you are taking.  Is there a way I could use my pictures in cloud?
B0049WHNLO|4.0|as a fan of classic jazz and Duke Ellington, i appreciate the music history offered to us in recordings like this. what a treat to be entertained some 60+ years later by a true pioneer . so many great musicians have credited Duke Ellington as an inspiration .. i can only add to the many nice reviews already written, that it is a  pleasure to enjoy this music today. the recording quality and sound is quite good for a record this old. if you like listening to the old standards, you will enjoy this release.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|We realy love the products we recently purchased. The movie DVD's are all-time favorites of ours. The blender was a gift for our daughter because we like and use our blended so much.
1476733953|5.0|Destined to be a sci-fi classic, Wool is also just a very well written piece of literature sure to please any reader looking for a solid story.  Mystery, love, humor, its all there!
B003VANOFY|1.0|I have had these for about a year. At best they have been just ok. They would occasionally lose signal while I was 3 feet away from the usb hub. The controls are lackluster. They also have an annoying habit of going into hybernation and won't respond to changes in controls. Also after about a year they quit working. The headset won't turn on unless the usb is plugged in and then none of the controls work. Try a different brand. Spend more money for the wireless, surround sound, mic, gaming features made by anyone than logitech. I read the iffy reviews before I bought them and thought \\"well it's cheaper than other sets offering the same features\\". Well I'm ending up spending more because now I will buy the more expensive, non-logitech alternative after wasting my money on these. Do yourself a favor, bite the bullet spend more elsewhere and you will be happier.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game to challenge you and pass some time! Loved it<br />I just wish it had better graphics , but other than that it was awesome.
B003L77FYS|5.0|More development of the characters from season two.  More romantic tension between the primary two.  And some development of the minor characters as well.  A good time.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I read The Alchemist as my daughter was making a major journey after graduating college.  She was carrying this book by Paulo Coelho to read on her long flights: Reading it helped me cope--helped me let her go.  I wish I had read it in my 20s, but it's an inspirational story at any age.  It brought to mind the story of Pippin, which I had seen the original Broadway production of, after I graduated High School.  Reading this book made me more focused on how important it is to allow ourselves (and others) to follow dreams--live out Personal Legends without fear.  Santiago's journey shows how the universe can provide all we need to fulfill our true destiny if we are open and receive each blessing with appreciation.  This is a book I see myself reading again and again if I am not too busy noticing the omens and following the path of my own true calling.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game it's great to have and use it to enhance my mind it's also fun to play this game I would recommend this game.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very Fun. Only thing is stuff gets expensive quick. You have to save up a lot of Money. Also finding buildings is rather impossible.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This will be my new game for waiting at the doctor's office! I highly recommend it for leisurely playing and passing time.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game!! It lets u style it however u want!! I play it all the time anytime!! Awesome!! I give it 5 stars!! No flaws at all!
B000MZHW4A|4.0|I thought this movie was great, and read the book. The book is, of course, more complicated and detailed, but I think the movie does a good job of putting it all together into a format both reasonably accurate and also entertaining.  It was somewhat violent, but as other reviewers have said, it was/is a violent situation.  I felt DiCaprio really made his bones w/ this flic, I think it's his best effort.<br /><br />Please note: This is the Fullscreen DVD, not blu-ray.  I checked the DVD to make sure it wasn't fkd up, as some have been in prev reviews.  This one is OK.
B000FA675C|5.0|Once again another movie made from book and the book is AWESOME to read. Enjoying the book greatly. Love Robert Langdon!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this off a relative's wish list and he is very happy with it.  Thanks for the gift system :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the best game I have and I've got a lot of good games.<br />Sweetness<br />Fun<br />Animals
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This movie is a great addition to any movie collection.  It is one of the best musicals every made to this date.  It is captured well in this movie format.  I enjoyed every minute of viewing it.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|We really enjoyed the film Maggie Smith is one of our favorites.  Th music is wonderful as are the rest of the characters in the film.
B003U657OA|3.0|Carrie is a brat here but still love the movie. Too much miscommunication. Love Chris Noth though and I recommend the movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|After due consideration and further examination I find this APP to be excellent. I gave it a. bad review and then changed it. It is just different than before but excellent as before.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I enjoyed some of the book but felt that the author was to detailed on his disease process. I have a medical  background and appreciated the detail but feel a reader without such would find it to much. His family history was also touching but left me wanting more( here I would have appreciated a little more ). I enjoy reading about near death experiences because we all want to know what lies ahead.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Well written story somber words of a fallen man and the mistakes of his vane life . Some what predictable ending but worth the read
B0090SI4LU|2.0|Eh!... it wasn't terrible. I read the book and wasn't too impressed. No Twilight. Oh well, they all cant be a smashing hits. The movie encompassed the book however the book was not that great.
B00CWEQ62S|1.0|It says it's available on Kindle for Windows 8 and it's not.  According to Amazon this is a problem with the publisher, not the app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's a very good book. A great story well told of bad that turns out good. I loved it and recommend it.
1594745692|5.0|I love to collect  tarot and oracle cards, I read them as well, and sometimes for a theme party or event it helps to have a deck that closely matches that theme.<br /><br />The Zombie Tarot is perfect and reads well, beautifully boxed to protect it and the book.  The retro illustrations are very creative.  Card 13 or Death could be a bit off putting to more sensitive people, but if one stresses that changes are coming that lessens any misunderstood concerns.<br /><br />The spreads outlined in the book are very helpful, and the comments on the various cards are informative and funny, so with a combination of traditional tarot understanding and the Zombie interpretations you have a deck that really presents things to one's current life situation in the 21st century as we are all zombies working to stay alive.<br /><br />The back designs however are not double sided so you can tell from the back side if  a card is going to come up reversed.  But that really should help the reader prepare for the possible reverse reading.  My boyfriend, a retired magician, reconized the image of the swami and said &#34;Poor Alexander, he's getting a beating on this deck&#34;,  the Swami is a deceased magician called &#34;Alexander, the Man Who Knows&#34;...really that is perfect for a Zombie deck when one thinks about it.
0764169742|5.0|The book starts off with needed materials including what pencils will be used, then goes into composition of your subject.  It teaches the regular burnishing, underpainting and layering.  Great detail has gone into these and many other subjects. You feel excited about going into your first excerise.

1451695195|2.0|Since its publication in October 2012 Proof of Heaven has sold over two million copies in English alone. Consider as an example of its success the fact that it has amassed over five thousand reviews at Amazon.com in nine months. The success is striking, but it isn't a miracle. Proof of Heaven has all the elements of a bestseller: a fast-paced, engaging read, a credible witness, and an extraordinary visit to the afterlife. If heaven is on trial, neurosurgeon Dr. Eben Alexander aims to be the star witness.<br /><br />The day was November 10, 2008. Alexander was admitted to the hospital whilst suffering severe pain and convulsions. As he continued to decline rapidly the doctors eventually diagnosed an extremely rare case of E. Coli meningitis. Soon after arriving at the hospital, Alexander fell into a coma. After six days in the coma with his brain under continual assault from the E. Coli bacteria, it was all but assumed that Alexander would either die, or live the rest of his life comatose as a PVS patient. (In Appendix A one of the attending physicians, Scott Wade, states that the morality rate under those conditions exceeds 97%. (p. 184))<br /><br />And yet, on the morning of the sixth day even as the family was attempting to prepare for the inevitability of death, a rainbow appeared in the sky and Alexander spontaneously revived. Even more incredibly, within two months he had recovered fully. As Alexander says, his case of illness and recovery is N of 1. That is, it is a case without precedent, in a category by itself. (See chapter 17.)<br /><br />This recovery is extraordinary enough. But it is not the recovery that drives the story. Rather, it is the claims Alexander makes about his journey during those days in a coma. According to Alexander, during this period he left his body, and his own sense of self, behind and journeyed into another world. The journey began in a dark, foreboding sphere of groans, threatening faces appearing from the gloom, and noxious smells. But then Alexander broke free into another world of ethereal beauty, flying over bucolic fields with angelic figures darting about in the skies above (this is the Gateway). Eventually he climbs into a higher sphere (which he calls the Core) where he communes with God himself. And from the setting of the fields to the Core Alexander is accompanied by a beautiful woman. It is easy to capture the echoes of Dante's Divine Comedy here with the move from Inferno to Purgatorio and on to Paradiso, accompanied by the lovely Beatrice.<br /><br />Needless to say, when Alexander regained consciousness his recovery was considered by many miraculous, but his passport stamp was even more so. And now he has shared this miraculous story with the world along with a (rather predictable) message from the creator of all things. As it turns out, the Beatles had it right: All you need is love.<br /><br />So what should we think of this incredible story? I'm going to analyze the book in two steps. I'll start with a theological analysis of the book in order to compare and contrast Alexander's claims with those of orthodox Christianity. Of course, this section will be of especial significance to those folks who are orthodox Christians and count orthodox Christianity as a way to judge the truth or plausibility of various claims about the afterlife. Then we'll turn in the final section to a broader means of evaluation that should interest everybody: is this story credible?<br /><br />*Is the story Christian?*<br /><br />So first off, the theology of the book.  Before Alexander&iexcl;¯s experience you could call him a very liberal Episcopalian. As he says \\"the fact was that for years I'd only been a step above a 'C&Eer' (one who only darkens the door of a church at Christmas and Easter).\\" (p. 34) After his experiences, however, he underwent a sort of spiritual renewal. The experience is powerfully described during his return to church during Advent. He writes:<br /><br />\\"The stained glasswindows with their clouds and angels brought to mind the celestial beauty of the Gateway. A painting of Jesus breaking bread with his disciples evoked the communion of the Core. I shuddered as I recalled the bliss of infinite unconditional love I had known there.<br /><br />\\"At last, I understood what religion was really all about. Or at least was supposed to be about. I didn't just believe in God; I knew God. As I hobbled to the altar to take Communion, tears streamed down my cheeks.\\" (pp. 147-48)<br /><br />This sounds like a spiritual renewal, but of what kind, exactly? The casual reader would probably conclude that this was a Christian renewal. But that is far from clear. Note the telling phrase, \\"I understood what religion was really all about\\". Alexander is clearly evangelistic about his experience: \\"I see it as my duty, my calling, to tell people about what I saw beyond the body and beyond this earth.\\" (p. 10) However, his message does not concern Christianity in particular, but rather a broad form of spirituality the main premises of which are summarized in \\"Seven Cornerstone Postulates\\". (These postulates are listed at the website of Alexander's newly founded Eternea organization.)<br /><br />Alexander's gospel sounds like yet another Oprah spirituality book reminiscent of Neale Donald Walsch's Conversations with God and Marianne Williamson's Return to Love. The basic doctrines of this gospel are that love is all you need and this world is illusory or less real than a spiritual reality that lies beyond. Noticeably absent from this feel-good gospel is any reference to sin or the need for repentance. Here is how Alexander presents the gospel in a message he received from his Beatrice guide:<br /><br />\\"You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever.\\"<br /><br />\\"You have nothing to fear.\\"<br /><br />\\"There is nothing you can do wrong.\\" (p. 41)<br /><br />I don't need to tell you that there is a whole lot we can do wrong. And a healthy recognition of our own penchant for evil and self-deception should create a healthy fear in all of us. So at best I'd count this misleading and dangerous instruction. That's not an auspicious beginning.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Alexander's description of God shares little with a Christian conception. Indeed, he eschews Christian names for God, opting instead to refer to God as \\"Om\\" (a Sanskrit mantra originating from Hinduism). This is in keeping with the Eastern, mystical tone of the book. Consider this passage:<br /><br />\\"Just as my awareness was both individual yet at the same time completely unified with the universe, so also did the boundaries of what I experienced as my self&iexcl; at times contract, and at other times expand to include all that exists throughout eternity. The blurring of the boundary between my awareness and the realm around me went so far at times that I became the entire universe.\\" (p. 160)<br /><br />Passages like this call to mind the Hindu maxim Atman is Brahman which identifies the self with all that is. While Alexander doesn't come out and embrace pantheism, his theology certainly appears more at home in mystical eastern traditions than orthodox Christianity.<br /><br />Finally, let me note that the book is also very gnostic in tone. Gnosticism was an eclectic set of Greek / Platonic philosophical and doctrinal claims that flourished in the Mediterranean basin during the rise of Christianity. Gnosticism was inimical to Christian doctrine and yet given its ubiquity in the culture and syncretistic nature, it provided an ongoing threat to Christian belief. (Early forms of Gnosticism are explicitly refuted in 1 John, for example.)<br /><br />The two most important gnostic claims were that salvation comes through the reception of secret knowledge and that salvation requires the abdication of the fallen material world and body for a spiritual non-material world and body. Both of these gnostic themes find echoes in Proof of Heaven. The reception of secret knowledge is a lesser theme. For example, Alexander writes: \\"Insights happened directly, rather than needing to be coaxed and absorbed. Knowledge was stored without memorization, instantly and for good. It didn't fade, like ordinary information does, and to this day I still possess all of it&iexcl;\\" (p. 49) Statements like this are not in themselves problematic. But they take on a more ominous tone when set against the backdrop of Alexander's other teachings.<br /><br />Incidentally, you might think testing some of Alexander's newly found knowledge would provide a solid ground for verification of his striking claims. For example, he makes assertions about knowledge gained in the Empyrean realm of the nature of dark matter and dark energy:<br /><br />\\"From the Core, my understanding of what we call 'dark energy' and 'dark matter' seemed to have clear explanations, as did far from advanced components of the makeup of the universe that humans won't address for ages.\\" (p. 82)<br /><br />So Alexander now has understanding of the physical universe that the rest of humanity won't attain \\"for ages\\". Perhaps he could share some of this scientific insight into the natural world to corroborate his claims and advance the cause of humanity? No such luck, for as Alexander then observes:<br /><br />\\"This doesn't mean, however, that I can explain them to you. That's because paradoxically I am still in the process of understanding them myself.\\" (p. 82)<br /><br />Gnostic knowledge is like that. You have it, but you can't share it with others. Consider this famous excerpt from the gnostic Gospel of Thomas (c. AD 150) where Jesus allegedly shares secret knowledge with Thomas:<br /><br />\\"When Thomas came back to his friends they asked him, 'What did Jesus say to you?'<br /><br />\\"Thomas said to them, ;If I tell you one of the sayings he spoke to me, you will pick up rocks and stone me, and fire will come from the rocks and devour you.'\\"<br /><br />The gnostic nature of Alexander's knowledge is a red flag. But more problematic from a Christian perspective is the denigration of the physical body and material world. For example, Alexander seems to hold the view that our soul is trammeled down by the material body which inhibits the power of our minds. By contrast, when we leave our bodies behind our souls are free to attain a new form of transcendence.<br /><br />For example, he describes people as \\"spiritual beings currently inhabiting our evolutionarily developed mortal brains and bodies\\" (p. 84). But liberation comes when our minds are freed from their bodies and brains: \\"To experience thinking outside the brain is to enter a world of instantaneous connections that make ordinary thinking (i.e., those aspects limited by the physical brain and the speed of light) seem like some hopelessly sleepy and plodding event. Our truest, deepest self is completely free.\\" (p. 85) In context it is clear that Alexander means free from the physical body. \\"This,\\" he says, \\"is the true spiritual self that all of us are destined someday to recover.\\" (p. 85) Incidentally, notice two additional points that follow from this statement. First, Alexander identifies himself as a universalist since he believes all of us are destined to recover this state of being. Second, note that he describes this as a recovery, presumably of something possessed before. This implies that Alexander holds to the old Platonic idea of the soul's existence prior to material embodiment.<br /><br />Interestingly, Alexander makes much of the fact that he was unaware of his personal identity during his NDE. What is especially interesting is how he interprets this fact: \\"because I so completely forgot my mortal identity, I was granted full access to the true cosmic being I really am (and we all are).\\" (p. 78) In other words, he seems to be saying that by leaving our physical bodies and personal selves behind, we are enabled to become more truly one with the universe. Again, the maxim of Atman is Brahmanappears to echo in the background.<br /><br />Consequently, the communion experience is not a reliable guide to Alexander's spiritual transformation. His gospel message is very different from orthodox Christianity. As a result, it looks like special pleading for Christians to accept Alexander's experience as evidence for heaven whilst rejecting all the \\"gospel message\\" he brings on authority back from that heavenly world.<br /><br />*Is the story credible?*<br /><br />You might think by this point in the review that I started reading \\"Proof of Heaven\\" as a cynic. Not so. When I began reading the book I found it very credible, a fact supported by Alexander&iexcl;¯s own impressive medical career as well (I suspect) as the contrast effect between Alexander as a witness and Todd Burpo, author of \\"Heaven for Real\\".  \\"Heaven is for Real\\" features the \\"recollections\\" of Todd's 3 year old son Colton about his own visit to heaven. In my view, it seems overwhelmingly likely that Colton was unintentionally fed information and created false memories as a result. By contrast, Alexander seemed to be a very sophisticated, thoughtful and credible witness.<br /><br />But the more I read -- how should I say this -- the hokier it all seemed. For example, Alexander describes incessant pouring rain the whole week he was in a coma (which, he says, is very unusual for Virginia at that time of year). But then on the morning he returned to life a beautiful rainbow appeared. Details like this sounded contrived to me. (And as it turns out, it was. More on that in a moment.) Likewise, Alexander's revelation that his beautiful guide in the afterlife was in fact a deceased sister he'd never met struck this reader as a predictable Chicken Soup for the Soul plot device. As I read on the narrative seemed overly stylized, the story massaged for maximum impact. The familiar feel-good all-you-need-is-love gospel didn't do anything to allay these concerns.<br /><br />My skepticism stoked, I did a quick internet search and came across Luke Dittrich's just-published article on Alexander in Esquire Magazine, appropriately called \\"The Prophet\\". Dittrich conducted a series of interviews with Alexander and others associated with his case. And while it would be over-reaching to call the article an expose, it strikes me as a devastating critique of Alexander's credibility.<br /><br />Dittrich observes how Alexander's career as a surgeon was fraught with several alleged instances of malpractice. Of course, this in itself is not necessarily a problem for his credibility in this case. However, Alexander&iexcl;¯s response to these cases is. In one instance a woman suffered partial facial paralysis following surgery. A lawsuit ensued predicated on the allegation that Alexander had not provided her with an informed consent form that this was a risk of surgery. Eventually Alexander produced a form from his records, but it was missing the second page and was damaged. Dittrich writes:<br /><br />\\"The woman's attorney argued that 'it is  reasonable to infer that this pattern of disappearance of probative evidence was  not coincidental, but was in fact deliberate.' The attorney was arguing, in  other words, that when Alexander found things that didn't fit the story he  wanted to tell, he changed them, or made them disappear altogether.<br /><br />\\"Alexander settled.\\"<br /><br />Even more disturbing is a case from 2007 where, Dittrich notes, Alexander fused the wrong two vertebrae during a surgery. When he realized the mistake in a post-op follow-up he opted not to tell the patient, instead choosing to edit the report, presumably to cover up his mistake: \\"After he finished editing the report, it read as though he hadn't done anything  wrong at all.\\" Malpractice is one thing, but altering evidence goes directly to one's credibility as a witness. Dittrich concludes: \\"Once again, a lawyer was accusing Alexander of altering the historical record when the historical record didn't fit the story he wanted to tell.\\" Ultimately, a close look at Alexander's medical career would reveal a litany of failures:<br /><br />\\"By the time all his pending cases are resolved, Alexander will have settled five  malpractice cases in the last ten years. Only one other Virginia-licensed  neurosurgeon has settled as many cases in that time period, and none have  settled more.\\"<br /><br />But what about \\"Proof of Heaven\\" itself? Does Dittrich point out holes in the book? Indeed he does. The narrative begins with Alexander recounting the time he was almost in a fatal parachuting accident with a man named \\"Chuck\\". After Dittrich researched this case and found out that the Chuck in question had no recollection of the event, Alexander admitted to Dittrich that it wasn't Chuck after all. When Dittrich asked him to reveal the true identity of the individual he replied cryptically: \\"I am under very strict advice from the Simon & Schuster attorneys [Simon and Schuster is the book's publisher] not to divulge who that was.\\"<br /><br />Next, as I noted above the book refers to pouring rain during the week of Alexander's coma. Dittrich interviewed meteorologist Dave Wert and confirmed that there was not pouring rain during that week and there could not have been a rainbow on the day Alexander describes. Did Alexander add these details for dramatic effect? It would appear so. But then what else did he add?<br /><br />The core of Alexander's claim is that he lapsed into a coma during the week and lost all higher brain function. Thus, his dramatic heavenly experiences must be supernatural in nature. But these points are disputed by one of the attending physicians, Laura Potter. According to Dittrich, she reported that she put Alexander in a medically induced coma. This contrasts with Alexander's suggestion that the coma was produced by the meningitis. So then Dittrich inquires about the degree of Alexander's brain function during the week:<br /><br />\\"I ask Potter whether the manic, agitated state that Alexander exhibited  whenever they weaned him off his anesthetics during his first days of coma would  meet her definition of conscious.<br /><br />\\"'Yes,' she says. 'Conscious but delirious.'\\"<br /><br />In other words, the last basis for believing Alexander underwent a supernatural experience dissolves. Was Alexander's recovery extraordinary? Perhaps. Is it a good story? Indeed.<br /><br />But proof of heaven? Not so much.<br /><br />randalrauser.comBut more problematic from a Christian perspective is the denigration of the physical body and material world.

B0067R0APK|5.0|I`m a gardener and watch the weather closely. This is my &quot;go to&quot; app for weather watching....<br />I also keep track of the weather at my headquarters and where my family lives...
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Sail we all heard and liked it. But there is more meat on this bone. Check out Soul Wars which I at first blush seemed like a cynical jab at R&B & Hip Hop artist’s tendency of effusive self-aggrandizement in their praise tirades but it somehow successfully blends into a quirky upbeat anthem. And then there is Jump on My Shoulders that is as saccharin as cotton candy but somehow deeply fulfilling. Burn it Down manages to pull off a ‘White Mans’ version of Soul that is astonishingly authentic. And this is just the warm up Guilty Filthy Soul and Kill Your Heroes are as edgy and fresh as anything that’s been heard by a new band in a years. I could go on but the point has been made the whole album was a turn de force well worth the price. This CD will only leave you hungry for more.
B00000634J|5.0|John was on such a great path when he was killed so suddenly; his rehab/recovery, making up with Yoko, the birth of their son, and his last album, so heartfelt, so touching.  This CD encompasses a great selection of his solo music after the Fab Four, especially &#34;Woman&#34; and &#34;Whatever Gets You Thru the Night.&#34;
B0015AARJI|1.0|I ordered 2. One was fine but the other one had problems with the home button and the L3 does not respond well. It feels that it is not original
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|This was a good story up until the ending·  if i am going to read a book to escape then i prefer happy endings.

B005DJREJS|5.0|Completely awkward. Totally hilarious. I'm pretty sure my husband thinks I'm crazy, but I couldn't shut it off! Give it a chance!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a heart-warming story. Lessons of courage and kindness and love abound. Read this book at least once, and then share it with your children, parents and friends.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I downloaded this App like a second ago, and I used it for the first time, and it works pretty well, but I have a few problems with this App. When I was trying to listen to this Music-Video called &quot;Adorn&quot; by Miguel, it said, &quot;This video is not available in your country&quot;, and I was like, &quot;Huh, I live in America, how could this not  be working?&quot; So, I have a few problems with this App, but it is still a pretty good App. I recommend you to get this App.
B002GHHHP6|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies..  Can probably quote most of the movie.  Glad to finally have a copy for my collection!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|And I couldn't put this down!  Great characters, amazing plot, some interesting twists.  I've read all Baldacci's books and this one does not disappoint.  Although I'll be groggy and a little cranky &#34;tomorrow&#34; (aka later today) it was well worth it!
B003XDZLTG|5.0|The Croc Shayna shoe is just what I was looking for! It is comfortable and cute. I was worried that it wouldn't be wide enuf (I wear a 6 extra wide). I ordered the size 6, relaxed, and it fits just fine! It is so hard for me to find shoes that fit my small, wide feet that I was just delighted to get a pair that do fit!
0345529057|5.0|chose this rating because it definitely deserves it. its a great read and will keep you entertained. i love the books more than the show, there are always the little details in the books that you don't get in the show. the actual product is great, nice paperback books in a small case that carries them. Price is definitely key and a decision maker, if you decide to purchase separately they can get pricey. shipping was fast and easy. Nothing wrong with this purchase at all. Thanks guys!
B0041SGYVQ|5.0|First of all, I was shocked I'd never heard that this version was made. So THANK YOU, AMAZON PRIME, for streaming it!  I enjoyed every minute of it.  I've been a big fan of the Gwyneth Paltrow version for years, but this one is so much better--more detailed with a better supporting cast.  If you're an Austen fan, you will undoubtedly love this.
B007R21JJK|4.0|Motherboard is fine for the most part except for its un grounded audio situation. I can hear video card and spinning hard drives through the speakers somewhat. Headphones are okay tho. Some games are unplayable with sound now.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I have never laugh this hard... I laugh through the whole book loved it, I loved the story line good book
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Awesome! I could so watch this movie over and over again.  A true blockbuster for any age. \\"Doth thy mother knowth you warth her drapes\\"
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I use this all the time. Works great on my Samsung SIII. I haven't even tried google play to listen to music yet.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|I saw this in the theater many years ago, and I love it more every time I watch it.  I'm so glad Amazon Prime streams it for free!  I've read reviews with complaints about it being \\"boring\\" and the best part being in the last 10 minutes.  But if you're a fan of Jane Austen, you know that she creates a very real depiction of life as she knew it.  And Amanda Root does an amazing job of keeping the viewer interested and entertained... just watch her face.  You can practically read the character's thoughts.  This movie is absolutely wonderful.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Excellent balance of desperation, loss, sadness and triumph to wrap up the series. Only one loose end I wanted to see resolved that was not completely addressed... Well written.
0307352153|5.0|The word introvert has a very negative connotation in our society.  The author replaces this with a plethora of positive, proven advantages of being inward looking.  Anyone who is an introvert or has an introverted child or mate needs to read this book.  Introverts are not weird.  They don't need to come out of their shell.  They don't need to speak up.  They need to be themselves.<br /><br />Introverts made our world what it is.  Without them, we'd still be living in caves.  We would have no great literature.  There would be no Amazon to review books on.<br /><br />I grew up thinking I needed to pretend to be an extrovert, since they got the girls.  In my twenties I realized you get a lot more girls listening than talking.  In fact, you can get anything you want and still be an introvert.<br /><br />This book is telling us to be who we are, whatever it is.  If you are an introvert don't pretend to be an extrovert.  You'll just be a very ineffectual one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed this game a lot. Finished it too quick though, leaving me wanting more to solve! Kids had fun helping me too whenever I'd get stumped.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Well, I really think, in my personal opinion that this game is epic.<br />Not only is it fun, but you learn too. This game Is really cool.<br />So I recommend it.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|A beautiful game, great graphics too, and free! I love this game, it does not drain my battery, it plays smooth, and you can pick the way you want the controls to be. And it has a reference, a crashed helicopter...  You can find weapons in supply crates. Or you can start with a gun, but it's gonna cost you. You can buy a head start that starts you at 1500 meters. You can have a dog with you, he will kill zombies for you, and cries when you die. You can buy extra ammunition, and more supply crates. There are 3 modes,, Classic, Hardcore, massacre. In classic you run for your life, in hardcore it's hardcore. In massacre you kill as many zombies as you can. You can compare your score with friends, overall a great game, with temple run aspects, and you change your weapons and zombie looks! So has more things, and very fun, I recommend. [...]
1490313370|4.0|This book was.... ok.  I like that James Altucher gave it away for free so that anybody can hear what he has to say. He is a fine writer that never ceases to amaze when spitting out idea after idea. Though it does fall and drag for awhile when he delves into his own little quirks, needless stories, or unnecessary opinions. He also might want consider that becoming a millionaire from nothing might be a stretch for most readers. He should advise people to start small and then build off those goals and such. But I guess nobody is reading this book to be anything but a millionaire.

B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I wanted to play a league of legends type game and then i played this. I had my doubts at first but was i wrong. THIS GAME IS SO AMAZING!!!!!!! I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN
B00CF34B2I|2.0|I do not recommend this for any one who has experience in mtg. The best way I can sum this game up would be as follows. It's like playing against the luckiest new player you have ever played against, while using your friends deck, who wasn't really good at making them in the first place. The npcs take on average 45 seconds to upwards of 3 minutes to go through thei turn cycle. ( Iwas indeed using a stop watch for this due to the amount of frustration this was causing me.) The player( being you) takes their turns in 4-8 seconds. The animation (which you can turn some off but most you can't) wil take 8 seconds again. This is a 15 second turn for the player on average give or take. However the npcs will take upwards of  3 minutes a turn. That woulnd't be too bad all things considering if the decks you had to choose from weren't to poorly made. They take about 5-8 turns to end a game. With the npcs time alone will run you 15-20 minutes of waiting on the npcs to decide every game.<br /><br />Deck building- The illusion of choice is always there for this game , however no real choice is presented. The decks they give you are poorly constructed in the first place, so naturally you will want to edit their poor choices to cover the obvious flaws in the decks that you are forced to work with. However when you get to the deck editing process you are given a wonderful illusion of choice, By this Imean that when you get to the deck editing process, you are presented with several choices of cards to switch out wtth the cards of the premade deck they. present you with. Might I add again that the decks they present you with are made very poorly. So naturally you will want to edit them to cover the obvious and numerous flaws they have in their decks. When you get to this proceess however you realise that the cards they allow you to change out and choose from stick with the theme of the decks, weaknesses and all.  The cards you switch out are basicly all the same effect with a slightly different mana ramp /cost, this only beig said by 1-2 mana. You are able to place larger creatures in in some of the decks, but nothing that changes the play style of that deck or vocers obvious issues with the decks. In short every deck is poorly made and if you know anything about MTG. Playing with such decks will bother you.<br /><br />NPCs- I again would like to point out that the time in which the npcs take their moves is unacceptable. If you were playing with a friend irl and he was taking several minutes to make a simplistic move such as lay a land, or attack or not to attack, after turn 8( which these decks are slow).you would want to quit. You having taken 1-2 minutes during the battle to make your moves , where as your friend has taken near 30. Welcome to MTG 2014. Now imagine if your friend reset his deck to where it always went off the same every time. This meaning you will get random draws time after time, yet your friend. Who might Iadd is still taking 3 mins to make a choice, gets his deck off perfectly every time. This being said at the end of the day it comes down to random luck most of the time. I found myself having to restart fights over and over due to the poor quality of the decks i was given to work with, and the randomness of my cards, Couples with the perfection of the enemy. Each loss took 3 minutes for the npc to make a turn mind you., so getting through some stages took several hours of nothing but waiting on moves to be made.<br /><br />Over all- If you are casual and don't mind being told to BLOCK for 5 seconds every turn even when you have nothing on the field to block, this game is for you. If you don't mind playing with trash decks with obvious flaws with no chance of modifying them, then this game is for you. If you have loads of free time to spend waiting on an npc to make a move that should take less than a few seconds, then this game is for you.<br /><br />Music- It was good, enough said.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|More coins and characters .. andi like it so much i enjoy playing this game! Its kindda adicting game and very enjoyful to play.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Loved the books, now the series is brought to visual life in this slightly modified version. Enjoyed it years ago on tv and once again on dvd.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it takes some time to get used to the game but the game is nice. i like it a lot
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book is terrible. I don't understand how the first few books in the series could be written by the same author who obliterated this one. Extremely disappointing.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Full of action but the new team was annoying and Paula Patton looked hard in this film...she's is looking rough these days! Nonetheless, the movie was action packed and it kept my interest.
B005LAIH2M|2.0|Apparently, Amazon has a listed showing that you get both a iTunes copy and a UltraViolet copy.  However, this is a lie.  Apparently, the code only works once.  Once I used the code for the UltraViolet copy, the code doesn't work for the iTunes version.  It gives the error message that the code has already been used.<br /><br />There is nothing on the packaging that states that you can only use this code once.  This is utter nonsense, as every other movie that has offered UltraViolet and iTunes copy has worked; allowing me to have both copies of all of the movies that has offered them.  This is the only one that has prevented me from getting both.

0618001905|5.0|When one thinks of mass murder, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, or Pol Pot come to mind. However, King Leopold II King of the Belgians is in this group also. He instituted a system of enslavement which resulted in death, starvation, and unheard of cruelty onto the native population of Congo. He plundered the Congo of ivory and wild rubber. He set up a system whereby whole societies were destroyed so it could enrich himself. This was no benovolent ruler, he cared only for himself. He is still venerated in Belgium today, even for the mass murder he placed on the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<br /><br />I think the DRC is one of Africa's failed states due to how Leopold II and subsequently Belgium ruled this nation. Mobutu basically followed the same line as Leopold II and made the state his own personal piggy bank. If we condemn Mobutu, we should also condemn Leopold for what he did to this massive country.<br /><br />This is a great read about a crime that still remains hidden from many.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was fun and challenging but needs more levels. I hope to see more levels added to this game soon.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like the UI and the emails come fast. The design is awesome and easy to learn. It is great and better then the original email client that comes with the fire

B0050DIWFC|5.0|How would you deal with a dilemma such as this?  A happy family is disrupted by a tragedy through which they suffer together and alone with different outcomes.  The father who is a skilled prosecutor can do little to solve the issues involved, the mother's who is the rock of her family and friends withers, the child seems oblivious.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James is an interesting cat who speaks from the heart; and speaks with a straight tongue.

1451626088|1.0|Anne Neville was a strong woman -- a real figure in history.  Yes, people were more superstitious back then, but the Neville girls were educated with the sons and daughters of kings.  I found this book insulting to Anne Neville and to the Queen of England.  Thought it shallow and stupid.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|Fantastic puzzle game. Docking one star because of a few imperfections in the way the game controls work. I sometimes find myself accidentally moving the wrong waterdrop because my finger touched the screen in the wrong spot
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was a very thoughtful, touching, kind, realistic book.  Well written and very compelling.  How courageous and loving the family was and how lucky for the boy.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it works nice but page managing sucks and the messenger works just as nice as the messenger app does for ios
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show first caught my attention about ten years ago and I am glad to be able to revisit this engaging police drama again. The main characters are so well cast and the storyline keeps you hooked. Chiklis is amazing in this show. His role is as Detective Vic Mackey is so well played you just want his team to &#34; keep cleaning up the streets&#34;. The Shield is a show that you can watch and become very engaged in the high stakes that everyone is playing for.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am a hardcore console and PC gamer who rarely finds anything interesting about mobile games. However, the mechanics, atmosphere, and story were compelling. I cannot recommend this game more highly. Easily the best tablet/mobile game . I have played.

B00AEJM6H2|3.0|This was a pretty good app for a free app.  English is probably not the creators first language.  But it is pretty good nonetheless.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Terrific acting by Cranston and his side-kick! Great show,despite the parallel plot-lines with Weeds. However, Skylar is becoming irrelevant and boring.

B004FRX0MY|5.0|the cloud player is a great feature on the app. i like that feature a lot and the music plays nice
B005LW5J9O|5.0|I haven't finished the book so I will save a lengthy<br />review for later, but must say that the reason I haven't finished it<br />yet is because I keep going back and rereading portions<br />--it so pleasurable and satisfying to all the senses, I don't want<br />the experience to end.<br /><br />Imaginative and beautifully written, tweaking the intellectual<br />curiosity, teaching with a light touch, but also reminding us<br />of our infinite humanity along with the great poets and writers who<br />populate our plane.  It is as though the knowledge and divine<br />wisdom of the Gods has been channeled through ancient<br />and contemporary lips.

0385342071|4.0|What if you lost your engagement ring? What if you lost your phone? And you're wedding is in less than two weeks? I'm not the type to brood over losing a piece of jewelry given by my significant other, but losing an engagement ring that has been in the guy's family heirloom for generations is a different story. I'd be panicking - bordering crazy - if that ever happened to me.<br /><br />I was quite entertained and how she wrote it made me kept reading until 3am. I just couldn't put the book down. I liked Poppy's character a lot - funny, silly, non-confrontational, and selfless. I loved how you could make her do anything she could to help out people she doesn't even know.<br /><br />\\"I have no idea what to say next. I don't speak Japanese, I don't know anything about Japanese business or Japanese culture. Apart from sushi. But I can't exactly go up to him and say \\"Sushi!\\" out of the blue. It would be like going up to a top American businessman and saying \\"T-bone steak!\\"<br /><br />I also found Sam quite likable. I liked how he wasn't perfect or someone who'd sweep you off your feet right from the start. I liked how he was always there, but never implied he wanted anything more (probably trying not to confuse Poppy knowing that she's engaged or he didn't realize he wanted her until the last few chapters, I don't know). I simply loved their too-friendly-but-not-flirty relationship.<br /><br />\\"Thanks. Good save. That was sharp of you. Are you always this sharp?\\"<br />Yeah right. I'm so sharp, the only Scrabble word I can come up with is PIG.<br /><br />You already crossed that line, he texted back. What's the difference? And then he added, Flattered you thought I was a genius.<br /><br />The ending was very well put together, too. I loved how you could see really big changes both in Poppy and Sam, without going overboard, towards the end. I'm very happy and surprisingly satisfied with the ending. It wasn't what you'd usually expect in a contemporary romance novel - being the main characters are madly in love with each other and all the I-can't-live-without-you yadda, yadda, yadda - but it was perfect!<br /><br />And suddenly life is good.<br />I know that things are still uncertain; I know that reality hasn't gone away. There'll be explanations and recriminations and messiness. But right now I'm entwined with a man I think I might love. And I haven't married the man I know I don't love. And from where I'm looking, that's pretty good going, for now.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading the book. I was light, easy, and a perfect summer read. I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />For more reviews like this, please visit [...]ng the main characters are madly in love with each other and all the I-can't-live-without-you yadda, yadda, yadda - but it was perfect!<br /><br />And suddenly life is good.<br />I know that things are still uncertain; I know that reality hasn't gone away.

She and I have always had similar taste in music so I thought I'd look up Ed Sheeran and give him a shot.  Well, as I expected, I loved this cd.  I would describe him as alternative rock, which I love and his voice is super cool and I love his accent.  My new favorite!

B007VUA7VO|4.0|shows when my kindle is almost about to be 100% charged and the alarms are nice to. it tells me when its at 80%
B009AMANBA|5.0|Excellent film. Does not at all glorify war into something glamorous--which it is not. You see the pain, the loss, the tragedy. Day-Lewis is superb, as usual. Fields is believable as the sad, neurotic Mary Told Lincoln. The film shows politics every bit as complex and underhanded as they, indeed, are today.  Tommy Lee Jones is great as the rascally politician who finally helps win the way for the passage of 18th Amendment for Lincoln. Highly recommended. A great history lesson.

B00DENXXZ4|1.0|Not much to say, I used it on my mac and ipad for years with no issues. On the kindle it keeps crashing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|YEP that's right I think this game is BETTER than temple run and so do all my friends. Unlike temple run being so harsh saying that you've been eaten by those creepy demons wich give my sister nightmares, even though she is only 5, so I guess she thinks of monsters and every little kid is scared of monsters. Anyway although the comments are funny, It still Is harsh, it's alot of survival. Subway surfers however is a bit more mellow. The cartoons make it less realistic and then kids no it's not real and don't get scared. But really there is nothing to be scared of it is simply either a police officer or guard and his dog wanting to catch you( not kill you ) for doing graphiti on there trains so that's all ( hopefully kid s don't do graphiti on anything ). That's what me and my friends interpretation of it it's just plain fun.
B008XG1X18|5.0|no problems at all when using this app. I like the user interface its easy to use and the loading is fast
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Excellent acting. Great characters. The story is a little less than believable, but the actors carry it off with aplomb.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|Absolutely love remastered version.  Yes it has been CGI enhanced, but they did stick closse to the original.  Simply enhances the viewing.

I love this app. when i go to delete temp files or even cache files, it gives me a risk thing and says recommended to keep or keep it so i dont out and delete files that might harm a app or even my kindle. saves up space. it deletes about 1 gb of cache and temp files. and the task killer made me delete my other installed ones just for this.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I try my best to make these HOG' s last for awhile...but for insomniacs like me it was impossible to put down.  Very entertaining and not so hard that you will want to treat your hair out!
030758836X|5.0|I read this on my kindle + audio (if you don't have an audible account, get one), but this is for my wife that doesn't have a kindle. The book is great, the ending is a bit predictable, but it is so well written you don't care.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Awesome this is one very good movie you just have to watch to enjoy every minute of this epic film
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|this app gets boring at points. it just makes me want to delete because i said everything i wanted. but its great for kids and the sound changer is really good.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Definitely something different! I am going to love this character! Beautiful, holding you from page one to the end! Let's start the next now!
0425263924|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.<br />I can't wait tell # 4 come's out.<br />yes, to all the ladies that like romance book's.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|The thing that most stands about Forward Unto Dawn is the perspective. the story is told from the viewpoint of a group of marines in boot camp and that was a brilliant choice. Although it lacks the polish of a big budget feature, the kids do very well in their roles and there isn't a single actor that stands out as a weak link. The special effects are also decent, if sparse. I reccommend this film to Halo enthusiasts looking to delve further into the lore, others may find themselves a little bit lost.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|Better than the original facebook app for page managing, lets you do more.... its nice and I like it a lot. Its fast and easy to use...
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This is by far the worst action movie I have ever seen. I was thinking - it's summer, Bruce Willis, action movie - what can go wrong? Well, just about everything. Even though it is very loud and has lots of action scenes there is no reason to care about it at all. If you want to see Jai Courtney in a much better role then watch \\"Spartacus\\". And to cast him as Bruce Willis' son is just ridiculous.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|The story is original , the animation is the best computer animation ever and the characters are well developed . Just a great movie
1419818112|5.0|This is a heartwarming movie with fabulous chemistry between Keanu and Sandra!  Let yourself go with the mysterious mailbox and the timeline questions - enjoyable to watch over and over!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|boring all you do is fight, the dark knight rises app is much better. focus on making a console game version
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It has great graphics and fast gameplay.  A great way to learn the new card set.  It  work get old time players re-addicted to the game. Much better than lugging around big boxes of cards . Looking forward to multiplayer.
B003UESJF6|2.0|I did not like this movie because the jokes and every word the characters say are pop culture , everyone knows that for  a type of movie like megamind , pop cultures are its only advertisement to make people go see it because people are tired of anything like superhero or any kind of old fashion stuff . Bad movie
0307476073|5.0|Cheryl Strayed covered well her experiences as an unprepared long distance hiker. She left the reader to wonder why she had not prepared better for the hike.  Her emotions carried her away from proper preparations.  How she survived her lack of knowledge and unpreparededness is due perhaps to her emotional state.  I enjoyed the book, and especially knowing the kindness shown to her by other experienced hikers.  This book should be read by those who think it might be fun to take a jaunt along the PCT.  They could learn much from what the author shows a lack of deep thinking can bring a person.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like that it is cloud notes. I have quick access to notes that I took, and the cloud helps
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|It's almost surreal listening to new Sabbath material with Ozzy on vocals.  I remember 1998 very well, and how excited I was that they reunited for live shows.  When I first heard \\"Psycho Man\\" on the radio, I was intrigued.  I wasn't crazy about the lyrics or some of Ozzy's vocals, particularly the \\"Psycho man, Psycho man, looking for a victim wherever he can,\\" bit.  But the music sounded awesome to me. I could hardly believe that the band I'd discovered at a flea market at about nine or ten years old, which went on to become my favorite music I've heard in my life, were back together and writing new music.  I liked \\"Selling My Soul\\" better than \\"Psycho Man,\\" and waited like everyone else for a full new album to come together.<br /><br />Then came the Ozzfests and years of nothing new, and then \\"The Dio Years\\", Ozzy suing Tony over the Sabbath name, and Heaven and Hell.  Like most people, I gave up hope that I'd ever hear anything new from Sabbath with Ozzy.  And yet, here we are, 2013 and a hell of a lot of new music from Tony, Geezer, and Ozzy.  The whole Bill Ward thing was embarrassing, and Tony's struggle with cancer put things in doubt, but the Iron Man pulled through, and I believe his will and determination alone is responsible for this thing coming to fruition.<br /><br />I'm so glad he pulled it off.  I love \\"13\\" song for song, bonus tracks included.  Just like the old albums, the band varies between slow, plodding doom, swinging, bluesy heavy metal, and 70's-style badass hard rock.  Tony's riffs are as potent as ever, as shown in literally every song on the album except the one soft tune, Zeitgeist.  His solos are as legendary as ever, and set Sabbath apart from every pretender band out there trying to make a career off of Iommi's songwriting style.<br /><br />Rather than break down each track like so many have done already, I'll mention a few of my favorite moments.  \\"End of the Beginning\\" is incredible; eight minutes, about six different sections, traces of almost every Sabbath era from the 70's.  Epic, magnificent song.  \\"Loner\\" might be my favorite overall of the new tunes.  Someone commented on another site that he could imagine riding around in a Firebird in 1976 blasting this track, and that description perfectly nails the feel of the song.  \\"Live Forever\\" makes me want to cry at the sadness of life on one hand, and angrily flip off time and aging on the other.  It's one of the harder rock tunes, and seems like a defiant statement towards Tony's health issues.  Finally, \\"Damaged Soul\\"; wow!  I wish the jamming on that song would go on forever.<br /><br />The Best Buy exclusive version, not to be confused with the deluxe edition also available from Best Buy and everywhere else, has one extra bonus track, \\"Naivete in Black.\\"  Because of this song, I went for this version, and I'm glad I did.  All four of the bonus tracks have a harder edge and are generally faster than the album tracks, and to me sound a little like Dio-era musically.  I personally can't imagine having only the regular album and not these extra songs.  They are in no way filler.<br /><br />I could go on for days about all the things I like about this album, but really, reaching #1 status in country after country around the world says it all.  Congratulations to the legends, and thank God for Black Sabbath (followed by a devilish \\"heh, heh, heh\\" from the Ozzman).s of almost every Sabbath era from the 70's.

B004HO6I4M|1.0|Rio is predictable and a rehash of \\"Alpha & Omega.\\"  The animation in Rio is worse than Weinstein Company animation (my low bar for animation standards.)  The characters and jokes are annoying.  In addition, the songs are terrible.  Rio is overrated and quite honestly, I'm surprised people found it entertaining.<br /><br />My bottom line - Rio is a bad movie and I cannot recommend it.
1781162646|4.0|This was not the typical King novel. Instead it was a coming of age story set in a carniVal. There is a mystery about an old violent crime that happened at the carnival. The main character is a young man who works at the carnival the summer before going off to college. His high school girl friend breakS up with him before summer. Good reading and rge o,d crime is finally resolved
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Helped me wake up all the time. Its loud and the music alarm works nice to. I love this app

B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|The visuals are okay , the story is rich and so is the concept and content , the characters are bad and do not act like they were in the live action lord of the rings or the animated version . But this movie is not bad , it is just okay with some good stuff and a smidgit of bad stuff . Watch if you can , if you liked the books and The Lord of the rings movies , do not watch this movie
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Watched it on a rented DVD and loved it so much that I had to have my own copy.  Exquisite music that just mesmerizes me.  Definitely think it's a great deal.

B00CHVIAS4|5.0|I love this movie , the story is detailed and timeless , animation is along with ride of the guardians the best Dreamworks animation and the characters are  well developed , Dreamworks has an ability of making 5 movies in a row that are great and this movie is a good way to end the five masterpieces from Dreamworks and in 2014 I hope Dreamworks will make those five movies again
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice game. Disappointed that there are only ten Levels.  However, the levels are not only challenging but, logical as well. It made sense every step of the way.  Can hardly wait for more!!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|It connects all the news networks for the type of headlines youre looking for. Like for news, it finds all the headlines that cnn, abc, and new york times had posted. It also has great technology headlines. I like the IGN headline.... Its better then the actual ign app.

1616960922|5.0|The Emperor's Soul takes place in the same world as Elantris. It is a short novella worth picking up, especially if you enjoyed Sanderson's first book. I would recommend it to any fantasy reader.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I like this app mainly because it gives you fast sending and fast receiving even in bad wifi hotspots. I love the idea of showing when the person is typing a message
086571701X|4.0|This book is very thorough.  No detail is left out.  Whether you're a beginner, novice, or pro this should be on your shelf.  Not only does this read explain the mechanics of aquaponics, it brings you to realize how simple self sufficiency can be.  It also opens the door to understanding that world hunger is totally unnecessary.  If you combine aquaponics with solar, you can be not only off grid but kiss the grocery store and utility company good bye!
B002D0L0R2|1.0|The story is filled with clenches , the visuals are just a mess a mess a flash and characters and songs are atrocious
B003IWYOF4|5.0|Classic. I watch this movie all the time, can't go wrong with a John Hughes film. ;-) I've owned this movie many times over the years, and going from VHS, to DVD, and now blu ray...it looks amazing!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Awesome graphics and everything and this game is hackable so that is nice... I love this app. NEVER LAGGED ONCE
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Real page turner, never got dull from start to finish. Almost as good as the novels that Clancy wrote alone.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|The story is flawed in major ways but the visuals and characters are amazing which push way ahead of the average movie , it looks even better on Blu Ray , if you like rise of the guardians epic avatar and the sorcerers apprentice , you will love this movie
B0046A9MRW|5.0|The most unexpected ending! Could not keep the book down. A genius-a storehouse of imagination and intrigue. I want more!
B004VOBIE8|5.0|i can manage the files i want to rename, move, or just plain out delete the files. i like this app
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I absolutely LLLLLLLOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEE this game.  Whomever made this game is an absolute genius and I am extremely happy they made it free
B005LAIH4A|1.0|This movie and hotel Transylvania are the worst movies of 2012 this movie is not at all like Dr Suess because of the made up plot about a plastic city and the story of Lora's is just boring unlike the original book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best 1 I've been able 2 find the Ad space is completely out of your work space and doesn't take up much room. Works and looks great on my kindle HD fire and have never had an issue. Get it NOW lol
B006ZNRD06|3.0|I like this app, but i just prefer mobo player over this app, mainly because mobo player actually tried playing my network drives movies

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awesome finally I can play some minecraft on my kindle instead of my computer even though it's better
B00DD49R0E|4.0|If you thought Despicable Me (I) was overrated, you'll be more than happy to enjoy Despicable Me 2.  DM2, IMOHO is the funniest movie since Monsters Inc. (Not Univ.)  DM2 characters are well developed and don't rely on simplistic slapstick jokes.  The story is straight-forward and told with charm.
B00760BPOC|5.0|Riveting as usual. Couldn't put it down. A return of a lot of familiar faces, and some new ones. Next please.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very challenging game and will keep you coming back for more. fun for the whole family including kids and parents
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had the original Kindle and my cord just incinerated. This has been a perfect replacement.  Charged perfectly and quickly.
1781162646|5.0|It was very interesting and a quick read. It reminded me of a story out of the 1940's era. Another good one from Stephen King.
