B00005JODK|5.0|Despite being relatively new to the musicals, I found the 1960's integration themed Hairspray to be quite enjoyable and entertaining.  A wire-to-wire, upbeat, marathon that leaves you smiles from start to finish.  Hairspray's sets, transition, and cinematography were all top notch.<br /><br />The casting crew of Tina Gerussi, Richard Hicks, and David Rubin also did a magnificent job signing up John Travolta (as the recluse mother Edna Turnblad); Christopher Walken (as the naïve Wilbur Turnblad); Michelle Pfeiffer (as the ruthless and cunning Station Manager); James Marsden (as the colorful TV Host Corny Collins); Queen Latifah (as Motormouth Maybelle); and newcomer Nikki Blonsky (as the lead, Tracy Turnblad) in their respective roles.<br /><br />If you were a big fan of the 2002 Hairspray Broadway Musical, you wouldn't want to miss its most recently cinematic interpretation to date!
0684135051|5.0|Well, what can you say about Elizabeth Zimmerman?  After learning to knit from a friend and then struggling to decode complicated steps with the help of instruction books and the internet, I finally discovered Ms. Zimmerman's no-nonsense and quite experienced advice.  And am I ever glad.  She takes undecipherable knitting steps and says \\"Nonsense\\" and goes about simplifying everything.  My husband kindly bought her \\"Knitting Workshop\\" DVDs for me, and I watch them over and over and learn to love this new craft even more.  I am SO glad I discovered Elizabeth Zimmerman.
B000P2A24W|4.0|I've got to hand it to Jon, Ritchie and the others, they keep on putting out good music.  \\"Make a memory\\" is worth the price of the CD alone to me.  There are lots of catchy, story telling tracks on the project and the production is top notch.  I would have liked to hear more from Sambora, and would have appreciated 2 or 3 harder edged songs.  It's an easy listen, somewhat eclectic and keeps moving.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|This young artist who is Scotish with an Italian name is someone I wish had more albums to purchase.  His method of singing takes your breathe away as he puts his all into it.  He is exciting ot listen to and watch.  He is a handsome young man with lots, and lots of talent and this CD is one I will always cherish.  His songs are mostly about true incidents that  have happened in his young life, including the loss of his Grandfather, which is included with a song that is extremely moving.  The love songs  are sexy and move you, and a couple are just plain fun.  I highly recommend this Artist!
B00092QUQC|5.0|One great outfit these Gotthard gents.  I always hated it when people compared my stuff to other bands, so I won't say they sound like anyone, and yet your going to hear influences from all over the place, from song to song to song.  Maybe just a coink-a-dink. A really fun album to listen to, great production, great mix of songs.  Maybe better rated at 4.5 stars but I'm feeling generous tonight.

1416523359|3.0|No one could ever accuse Steven King of `rushing a story along' and Lisey's Story is no exception.  As has been pointed out by other reviewers, King's trademarked internal dialogue, while at times entertaining, is getting old and tends to bog his novels down. There is no reason why this story required over 600 pages to tell.<br /><br />For me though, the biggest issue may be my own ability to suspend disbelief.  If, as King suggests, there is a pool that writers drink from, my ability to suspend disbelief is like an elastic band.  Sometimes King pulls it taut and lets it go and it's a hell of a ride, and sometimes... well sometimes, it just snaps.  I realize that this may not be a point of view shared by others, but I like supernatural elements up to a point, and then things just get too weird for me.<br /><br />Lisey's Story reminded me a lot of Rose Madder; in fact, in many ways it is a retread of the earlier novel.  In both cases the main characters enter a strange `other world' that empowers them, they are pursued by a bad man who wants to hurt them, and they manage to get the bad man to enter the strange world where the bad man suffers a much deserved fate.<br /><br />For me, in both cases, the elastic band snapped.  I could accept the `alternate world' but the emergence of a strange creature like the `long boy' was too much for me.  (It would appear that I am ok with alternate worlds, as long as they don't include strange beasts that eat people).<br /><br />The bottom line is that most readers of Steven King will find this novel too familiar, too sluggish, and too unexceptional to rival vintage King novels like The Stand and The Shining.  That said; it isn't a complete misfire either.  It builds momentum near the end, and while a little strange for my tastes, I found myself turning pages quicker and quicker as I waded deeper and deeper into the pool.<br /><br />If you decide not to read Lisey's Story, you aren't missing much.  If you decide to read it, the best I can say is that it's marginally entertaining.y entertaining.
6305308659|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I love the story and the way they have slowly turned each person from black and white to color.  It says so many things in this movie that I just think it one of the best.
B0009X7664|5.0|\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" was made long before the feminist war on men. Warren Farrell once wrote that we have gone from \\"father knows best\\" to \\"daddies molest\\". This movie belongs to the \\"father knows best\\" category. If the movie had been produced during the Clinton administration, it would have featured Sally Field as a fearless feminist attorney fighting  bigotry in a small southern town while single-handedly raising her two children after their drunken, abusive father had walked out on them. Boo Radley would have been institutionalized before he could get his perverted hands on Scout.    Fortunately we are spared all that. Instead we have Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, a widowed attorney who raises his children with kindness and compassion, aided by his black housekeeper Calpurnia. Atticus is given the job of defending a black man accused of raping a white woman. He braves the wrath of the town by giving the man an honest and competent defense and tries to get him acquitted. Meanwhile he defends his children by shooting a rabid dog (could Sally Field shoot a rabid dog?) and teaches them not to kill mockingbirds. In the end the unlikely hero of this movie turns out to be the strange and reclusive Boo Radley. If you are tired of movies that portray men as either morons, abusers, or gladiators, then this movie is for you.
032147404X|4.0|It's an interesting and useful approach. Create recipes for a variety of shots and shooting styles. It is satisfying to the novice to get the results without having to learn the theory behind it all. As Kelby says there are many boks which discuss that.Unfortunately Kelby's attempts at humour in this book are over the top, distracting and sometimes offensive. \\"Humorous\\" topics include beating someone to death with a tripod; kicking over another photographers's tripod and delighting in the tinkling of glass as his lens shatters on the ground. Shooting photos when intoxicated... \\"kidding..sort of\\". This kind of stuff makes an otherwise good book a tough read sometimes. Its a great head start for  DSLR newbies to see how certain shots are taken without having to wade though the theory. But the irritating, disrespectful 'humor' is something you have to overlook to benefit from this book.
0321344758|5.0|If you're responsible for designing anything, website or not, read this book. Now.<br /><br />It's great at explaining why usability needs to be the primary concern in developing any sort of interface. The way a user looks at a site is very different than the way a designer does, and \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" points these things out clearly and easily.<br /><br />Even the title is a lesson, one of the most important in the book; \\"Don't Make Me Think.\\" If the interface makes the user think when they don't need to, it's bad. Cartoons, short chapters, and plenty of illustrations make this a quick, light read that will leave you convinced to spent more time on usability.<br /><br />While the book's shortness is one of its strengths, I'd say it's also its only weakness. It convinces you to spend more time on usability, but doesn't go too much into how. But that's covered in many other books, and a few are even given at the end.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|this is one of the best movies ever!! 300 is done perfectly, i loved it. gerard butler was a great king leonidas, all the 300 wore great uniforms... all kidding aside this movie was it for me. i watched it twice the first day. the story was beautiful \\"only spartan women bare real men\\" and \\"we were born for this\\", and my favorite \\"this is sparta!!\\" wonderful, all was wonderful. a small but strong unit going against a huge tyrant. they fought to the death, they went out like true soldiers, never giving up, never going back, strong hearts = strong men. the action was excellent. never letting up at all. after i watched it i was even hyped. the ending was great, but why did leonidas have to die, why?! i let out a tear or two, it was gripping and very emotional what one man and his friends would do for their land and their freedom. he was strong, smart, but also in love and that had me in awe. i felt it was to short, it left me wanting more. great film, i loved it.
B000002KE2|4.0|been a bad week. sometimes it seems that the forces of darkness are winning. on monday i bought our dog a stuffed toy fox. within hours of bringing it home, we discovered that it was a 'lesbian' stuffed toy fox. i won't go into the details of how we found that out. i'll just say that what we saw left no room for doubt on the matter. on tuesday, i jumped out of bed all excited, because i had a feeling: today was the day that Jesus would finally return! i was sure of it. i called into work sick and stayed glued to fox news hour after long hour. Jesus didn't return. wednesday passed, still no Jesus. then on thursday evening we did a surprise check up on our son. we burst into his room unannounced and found him listening to music on headphones. though he fought us, we got the headphones away from him, and to our horror, discovered that he was listening to black sabbath vol. 4. what next? of course we took his music away and locked him in his room for the weekend. but on friday i will admit to a terrible sin. I actually listened to this music myself! and worst of all, i loved the ballad \\"changes.\\" the instrumental, \\"laguna sunrise,\\" i found simply gorgeous. even the album opener \\"wheels of confusion\\" had a certain, well, power, or something, that i couldn't deny. it almost made me like rock and roll. i need forgiveness.
6305546789|5.0|halloween was and still is the movie everyone remembers and still talks about. enough said, john carpenter made you cringe and always look behind you with this one. he made babysitters all over the world lock their doors and keep a constant eye looking out the window. he made the boogyman real. this is a masterpiece. i'm hooked on this psychotic killer who just never dies. you can't kill evil, it just keeps on coming. and jaimie lee curtis, her breakout role, made a name for herself, great actress she has mad skills. this film is different from todays films but it still manages to scare you. you don't want to be alone, because he'll find you.

6305291446|4.0|why is it that these two go so great together. jamie was made for this, and the \\"shape\\" michael is super. this movie was special. they reunite after so long, and this one's up there with halloween the original. it's that good. mike breaks out, and is coming to get her, she feels it, and her son and his friends the first he comes after. then they meet face to face. i love that part, great acting. then he's after her. she gets tired of running and fights back. and in a certain scene she's the hunter not the hunted, good twist for a minute, but as always michael is the boogyman can't beat him. the chase is on. then she thinks she's won, but not by a long shot. it must go on again... super movie, loved it.
B000002GWJ|5.0|I never thought I would be writing a Tom Waits review but here I am. A very good friend of mine, (thank you so very much, Mr. Robertson...) actually bought this album for me and had it sent to my home. Well, three months later, I now own TEN Tom Waits albums. I am now of course, a hopeless Mr. Waits addict, even more surprising is that I normally listen to bands such as Tool, Rush and Black Sabbath. However, Mr. Waits simply transcends musical genres and I love him for it, he is an absolute genius who writes, sings and plays, from the heart.<br /><br />The album is just so atmospheric, dense and evocative, that I never tire of listening to it. It is the kind of album into which the listener simply disappears and what a dark honour it is to inhabit this blue, smoky world. From the other worldly opening of 'Somewhere' with its bold, redemptive optimism, \\"We'll find a new way of living, a new way, of forgiving...\\" to the desolate, heartbreaking portrait of dark love on album closer, 'Blue Valentines' you know you are in the prescence of greatness. This is still my favourite Tom Waits album and is now one of my favourite albums of all time.<br /><br />These are the songs of the lost and the lonely and tracks like 'Christmas Card From Hooker In Minneapolis' feature some of the best lyrics I have ever heard, \\"I'd buy me a used car lot and I wouldn't sell any of 'em, I'd just drive a different car each day, dependin' on how I feel...' Beautiful.<br /><br />Other highlights are 'Red Shoes By The Drugstore' with brilliant lines  like, \\"As the rain splashed the nickel and spilled like Chablis all along the midway...\\" and \\"There's a dark huddle at the bus stop, umbrellas arranged in a sad bouquet...\\" There are a book full of ideas in one song.<br /><br />'Kentucky Avenue' is pure heartbreak, with such an unusual angle on a relationship that I would defy anyone not to be moved by it. The closing lines, \\"Put a church key in your pocket, we'll hop that freight train in the hall, we'll slide all the way down the drain, to New Orleans, in the fall...' are simply wonderful.<br /><br />Blue Valentine really does approach perfection and cannot be recommended too highly. My love affair with Mr. Waits continues with every album, each one evokes its own character, its own world and to inhabit these worlds is just such sweet, sweet surrender.the drain, to New Orleans, in the fall...' are simply wonderful.          Blue Valentine really does approach perfection and cannot be recommended too highly.

B00008EY9G|4.0|it's impossible not to like this movie. it had everything tapped into one, it was great. great cast, john cusack, amanda peet, and ray liotta they made this movie what it is. a thrill ride, that'll keep you guessing from start to finish. the stormy night, the creepy motel, ten strangers getting killed off one by one. who's the killer, everyone's in a panic, nobody trusts nobody, whos's the bad guy, who will live and who will die. this movie keeps you glued to the screen and i think it's that way everytime you watch it. then when you find out what's really going on, you get blindsided. you don't expect it. i sure didn't, but that's what was good about it. you just didn't know what was coming, or who was next, or who was telling the truth. nicely done.
B000VDDDY6|2.0|I've seen some of the remastered episodes and they are fantastic.  That being said, over $400 for 77 episodes is a unbelievable ripoff.

B000GCFO08|5.0|this is one of the few movies that has scared me. that says a lot because i don't scare easy. it was five big stars in my book. the acting was good, but the best part was silent hill and all it's demons and nightmares waiting in the wings. they were grotesque in a beautiful way. it was disturbing in some scenes, no doubt. but it was all done in a way that will make your skin literally crawl, and make your hair stand on end. this movie was wickedly evil. every time that siren went off you knew what was coming. the demons from the darkest corners of hell were coming. the game is good, but this was better, and it sure was about time. i honestly loved it, and it did creep me out no lie. guaranteed to make you squirm or look away, so watch it and you'll agree.
B000PKG4SC|4.0|My friend Anat has the video of Shirley Bassey doing \\"Get This Party Started\\" on her MySpace Page, and I couldn't think of a better singer to cover this. I love her singing on the Bond themes, especially Goldfinger. The Welsh/Nigerian songstress has such a rich and strong voice, it is great to hear her work it out on a Pink song. Her enunciation is so crisp and clear, you can hear every word--but when she comes to a slightly naughty word, she laughs just enough to obscure it slightly. In the original, it is covered up with a fuzz guitar.<br /><br />The video is campy to the max. It kind of looks like some kind of masquerade party out of Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut. Dame Shirley Bassey belts out the song surrounded by the masquerade dancers. At one point there is a kind of Busby Berkeley moment that morphs into a Bondian Rorschach 007 pistol. She tags on an ending that though rather dated, gives her a chance to hit a spectacular last note with her gorgeous pipes. Check Anat's page for it:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />She does some of her previous hits, but in new versions. \\"Big Spender\\" is done Ala Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\" in its new incarnation. \\"I Who Have Nothing,\\" \\"This Is My Live,\\" Grace Jones' \\"Slave to the Rhythm,\\" Michael Bolton's \\"Can I Touch You There,\\" \\"What Now My Love,\\" and Gloria Gaynor's \\"I Will Survive\\" are all given the Bassey treatment, which is lush arrangements, strings, backing vocal harmonies, along with an edgy, updated modern dance feel--all supporting Dame Shirley Bassey's soaring vocals. She also updates the James Bond theme \\"You Only Live Twice,\\" one of the few she didn't do. It was originally done by Nancy Sinatra.<br /><br />This has given Shirley her first top 10 album in the UK in 10 years--and deservedly so.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This short-lived TV series is a must-have for your collection. It combines the Wild West with science fiction in an unusual but effective way.

B00005JLCI|5.0|This DVD is the perfect play made into a masterwork of a film. This is an entertainment that exposes us to a classic that has come down through the ages and shines new light on it's meaning, beauty, and it's poetry. It  uses all the tricks and slight of hand that cinema can bring to bear, crea  -ting a complete and intricate screenplay illuminated by a lush and georg-  eous soundtrack.     It is as close to perfection as a work of human kind will ever come. This film gives us one excellent performance after another. The only fault  I can find in performance is that of Jack Lemon. He seemed to struggle for  a while, with Shakespearean language, but recovered in the second half of  his performance to turn in a more than adequate performance. Unfortunately  for Mr. Lemon, all the other performances are stellar and make his lack of  command of Shakspearean english stand out like a broken neon sign.      The director took great care to make the dialogue was spoken clearly  and is easily understood. They made this film with the most complete and   vibrant version of the text ever used in film.       If one is new to this masterpiece this is the version of the play to  be initiated with if you are seeing it on film as opposed to a live produc  -tion. If one has seen this play a hundred times you will still benefit by  viewing \\"Hamlet\\" in it's most complete and illuminating version yet.       Even if you don't have much interest in Shakespears' masterpiece for  it's own sake you will still derive great pleasure from this seventy milla  -meter beauty. It embodies that which makes cinema high art and great ent-  ertainment all at once. The performances are, almost without exception, an  absolute joy. The costuming, sets and set decorations are perfect. The mus  -ic is oppullent emotional and a sublime underscore to Shakespeares wonder  -ful script.        The film is ingeneous in its' use of cinematic devices to illuminate  the story for the viewer. I suspect that the onlypeople who will be even  a bit displeased with this DVD are true purists of the mediam of the stage  or snobs who can't appreciate anything that is done in a new way.       The DVD comes with a full length commentary and a \\"Making Of\\" extra.  It has trailers is remastered in 5.1 Dolby Digital. What more could one  want for a trully spendid long winters evening of entertainment?
B00005ASOI|1.0|I purchased and watched this movie today with my brother and we didn't find it scary at all. The music was so annoying that I kept turning the volume down every time it came on and we both thought the acting was horrible. Yes, there was a lot of atmosphere to the movie but that alone does not make a horror movie scary. We found ourselves laughing at so much of this movie it was ridiculous. My favorite horror movie is the \\"Exorcist\\" which still scares me every time I see it - and I've seen it at least 12 times. Yes, \\"Suspiria\\"  was indeed a waste of time and money and we definitely would not watch it again.
B000N4S8RA|5.0|Many bands these days seem to get hyped up on there first album, only to get slaughtered by the press on their second and then forgotten about by their third effort.  Biffy on the other hand, have gradually floated to the surface, building up a hardcore contingent of fans along the way.  `Puzzle' looks set to propel the band into the mainstream.     Puzzle is the 4th album to come from Biffy's locker.  I came across them due to my brother being obsessed with them from day one.  I really liked Blackened Sky and went to see them a number of times.  When `Question and Answers' and `Infinity Land' came along I didn't appreciate them at the time because I felt they were just trying to over-complicate things for the sake of it.  Over the last year though, I have listened to these albums more and now find them refreshingly different from what was out at the time.  This made me wait for Puzzle with great anticipation...    With Puzzle it is like they have completed the full circle from when they began, and then stepped it up a gear. To break this down; with their first album it was the accessible indie/rock songs such as `27', `57' with some signs of prog in `Convex concave', which showed hints of their potential early on.  The second album saw them exploring their guitar sounds and song structures more.  While the 3rd album expanded their array of experimentation even more, through vocal harmonies, etc. Puzzles' roots clearly are from their first album, as they just wanted to go back to basics and make an album for the fun of blasting out a mixture of all out rock with acoustic masterpieces. Although the intro to `Living is a problem because everyone dies', along with numerous other points in the album, shows that they have taken bits from the two previous albums to put the `we haven't forgotten the progress we've made on the last two albums' stamp on some of the songs.      This is one of those albums you'll either love or hate, leaving no middle ground.  If you do love it, it will make every other record in your collection seem inferior for a month or 6.  `Puzzle' can be split into 3 large pieces; Rock, acoustic and rock ballady indie epic type songs.  The main rockers are the singles; `Semi-mental' and `Saturday Superhouse', both are all out, brilliant sing along tunes. The title `Semi-mental' does not do the song justice as it is `FULLY MENTAL!'. The acoustic songs end the album with `Machines' and `drop it'.  Listening to the lyrics in `Machines' its one of those ones that everyone can relate to at some time in their life. ie - not appreciating what they have and how lucky they are etc. Drop it on the other hand has got a kind of slow country feel to it; would be interesting to see if they took that sort of direction in the future.  The last category is the sweeping, epic, rock ballady songs such as songs ending with /15ths and my favourite song on the album `The conversation is....'  The easy comparison can be made to the Foo Fighters, but the reality is these are great songs, which definitely can be distinguished as Biffy's own.     This really is a great album and its almost as if Biffy knew when they were writing it that this would be the one that made them big with lyrics like - `looks like we made it' from `A whole child ago' and `This is the one' from `Now I'm everyone'.  Its almost as if they're trying to send subliminal messages to people, to brainwash them into loving the album..................well it worked for me anyway!
B000K7VHJQ|1.0|I usually don't write bad reviews - I prefer to praise movies that I love.  But I found this film deeply and profoundly offensive.  All I kept thinking while I was being repulsed is \\"What is Mel Gibson doing?  What is his agenda?\\".  It seems to me that this masochistic, Catholic guilt-ridden travesty misses the entire point of Jesus' crucifixion.  Wouldn't this great spiritual leader want us to focus on the message of eternal life - there is no death - rather than the suffering?

One of the best Uriah Albums along with Demons & Wizards. The idea flows through these albums of wise men (wizards and such like) are still here fighting evil. The concept that love can overcome evil flows through these songs among other things. People say things are worse now. In reality all through history good men and women fought evil and faced evil in all it's different forms. Sometimes Uriah Heap just sing about fun and other times songs like Magicians Birthday inspire us to carry on. This is more than great music. The message is still alive today ! I'm just sitting here drinking good red wine and being inspired with hope for the future of mankind by listening to Magician's Birthday !

0887307280|5.0|Great reading for the entrepreneur or anyone considering starting their own business.  Distinguishes between the \\"doing\\" of our business and \\"building\\" a business that thrives.

0141184884|5.0|This book is perfect for anyone who enjoys traveling, hiking or the idea of freeing themselves from a 9 to 5.  It's even better for those who feel all of these things simultaneously.  Kerouac writes with a terse honesty and gives the reader so many opportunities to apply meaning to our own lives.  He helps us to question our own role not in society, but in the search for ourselves.<br /><br />This book is a little less dark than most of his other books, and it contains some of his best ideas.  The protagonist uses another character, Japhy, to explore ideas of Buddhism (Japhy's zen versus his own version).  This is never done in an academic way, but rather in the spirit of the book itself: a free, wandering exploration which does not seek overall resolution.<br /><br />Kerouac seems to write as he lives: without too much worry and always with a song in his heart.  At one point Japhy becomes concerned about the protagonist (obviously a Kerouac alter-ego) because he is drinking so much.  The pathos here is magnified when we know the biography of Kerouac's life.<br /><br />This is a must read for people who live in the Northwest.  His description of their mountain-climbing is excellent.  I will let you find the good quotes on your own.
159102594X|5.0|Described by many as \\"noir fantasy,\\" I was at a loss as to what The Blade Itself could be - but my curiosity was piqued.  Although, the answer couldn't be more simple - it's a fantasy novel with strong noir elements, in a combination as refreshing as it is entertaining.    Admittedly, it's not for everyone: there are no damsels in distress or knights in shining armor.  Yet that's what grants Abercrombie's story its appeal - the characters are painstakingly real, even if they're not \\"heroes\\" by strict definition.    The very fact that one of the main characters is crippled demonstrates something that much fantasy seems to lack: this is a world with consequences - a wave of a magic wand won't heal every body and soul.  The characters aren't questing to save the world or defeat evil; they're struggling to live their own lives amidst fascinating plot and conflict.    Above all, though, Abercrombie's characterization is his strength.  The reader feels the pain and sees the world through the jaded eyes of Glokta, or is right alongside Ninefingers in his struggle for survival.  While the characters may have unlikable moments, the reader can always sympathize and can identify with them as real people.    I, for one, can't wait to get ahold of the next installment.
B000NA28I4|2.0|If you have read the book, I strongly suggest you DON'T watch the movie - it will annoy you. If ever there was proof that films do not tell stories as well as the written word, this is it.    If you haven't read the book, and don't intend to, then this film may only impress you with its cinematography.    I have never seen a story so incredibly mangled from its original form as this film. It's almost as if they pulled the pages from the book, shuffled them like a deck of cards, and re-stitched them out of sequence.    This is a great pity, because a good cast has been assembled to make the film, but the results of the film are considerably below the level of the participating actors.    The imagery is exceptionally good; the CGI team should be commended.    I will give the Japanese film companies credit for recognizing the difference between a story that needs a mini-series to be properly told, and when one can actually fit into a movie. The Americans seem not to have this talent.    Perhaps the author, Christopher Paolini, should look to the anime industry to have his story properly told.     I am sure he must be less than pleased with this dreadful shadow of his vision.
B0000549B0|5.0|Ever seen a 6 foot three-and-a-half inch Pooka in the form of a rabbit?  No, well neither could most of the other characters in this classic 1950 film about a man and his best friend (the Pooka) named Harvey. Harvey is an invisible large rabbit friend to the very friendly and good mannered Elwood P. Dowd, played by James Stewart.<br /><br />Elwood always looks out for Harvey and makes sure people who come up to talk with him are introduced to his best friend. Elwood also has a bit of a drinking problem but that's not the thing that embarrasses him to his much, much older sister (played by Josephine Hull who won an Oscar for her performance) who while seeing nothing wrong with living off his money and under his roof, sees Elwood as an embarrassment to her social ambitions and plans to marry her daughter off into it. After Elwood embarrasses her in front of a very important party she decides to have Elwood shipped off to a mental asylum but her plan immediately starts to backfire when she is committed instead. As various people talk to Elwood and mental asylum employees try and track him down everyone starts to question if there is in fact anything wrong with Elwood's (and Harvey's) behaviour and maybe if Elwood's outlook on life from his mother to choose pleasant over smart isn't so bad after all and something they could aspire follow a little to as well!
1594489505|4.0|Warning - do not read this book if you are under a lot of stress.    I felt a constant tension when reading this book.  I kept waiting for something awful to happen.  And it did.  Over and over again.  It was a page turner for sure.  I work full time and have 3 children, so reading time comes at a premium, and I read this book in less than 1 week.    It's not a book that you can say that you enjoyed.  The subject matter is too painful.  It's sad and moving.  But, the fact that the writing can make you feel so many things - that is why we read, right?      I learned a lot reading this book.  I admit that I do not know a whole lot about Afghanistan, so the history - especially told from a female perspective - was very enlightening.    I read a couple of the reviews here after I read the book.  Maybe it is propaganda.  I don't know.  But, Hosseini was born there and lived there for the first 10 years of his life.  It's obvious that he has an Afghanistan's soul.  I also read the criticism that it was predictable and manipulative.  I have to say that I did not find it so at all.      I also read \\"The Kite Runner\\", and I also found that book sad, but it had moments of hope and joy, while I felt that \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" did not really give the reader any break in the fear, tension, struggle, and hate.  I found that difficult.  This novel haunted me while I was reading it and for days afterward.  The one good thing was that it helped me to put into perspective my own problems and issues - meaningless compared to what these two characters faced.
B00009N83Y|5.0|I think the humor in this film is a little to sophisticated for most Clint and/or Burt fans but this is a great movie. This is a very intelligent comedy that many people just wont get. I have read that people think the actors gave wooden preformances, that's what the parts call for. This film has some great scenes, especially Clints fight scenes.
B00005JPRZ|5.0|What can you say about a film that starts off with the mortician delivering the wrong body to the family? Like so many well-intended family events, \\"Death at a Funeral\\" just keeps going downhill from there.     Brothers Daniel (McFadyen) and Robert (Graves), are quarreling over who is to pay the bills for the funeral.  Daniel and his wife Jane (Keeley Hawes) want to get out of the family house and buy their own flat.  Robert, the best selling NY based novelist thinks Daniel and Jane have 'sponged off the family too much.'     Martha (Daisy Donovan) is bringing Simon (Alan Tudyk) to meet her family for the first time and tell the folks they are going to get married.  Unfortunately, Simon's nervous and Martha gives him what she thinks ia a Valium from her little brother Troy (Kris Marshall) stuff.  Turns out, that pill wasn't a Valium--it was a hallucinogenic as strong as LSD and Simon is not making the kind of impression he'd like to have made on his future family.      Then, of course, there's the blackmail attempt from the decedent's former lover, the crotchety old uncle, and more.  It's just one crazy madcap adventure after another.  We barely stopped laughing to catch our breath between episodes.      I may well go back and see this film in the theatre before the run is off.  I'm certainly going to buy \\"Death at a Funeral\\" in DVD.
006085880X|5.0|Wow...I couldn't put this book down...what a wonderful, well written, deep, heartfelt novel.  A friend gave it to me to read and I hadn't read Picoult, but I sure will now!      This was an incredible, disturbing story - there was so much realism and humanity in it that it actually hurt sometimes.      Far from cheesey, sappy, or self indulgent - this author is a true gem.  So glad I found her!

B000I5XOW8|5.0|When I made the conscious choice to purchase a blu-ray player, and after doing some research regarding picture and sound quality, I decided that The Fugitive would be the first film I'd get.  All I can say is what a huge difference high definition makes. I already knew that the film was an excellent adaptation of the classic television series. The detail is really exceptional, and the sound is really enveloping. I recommend this blu-ray title wholeheartedly...
1416911049|5.0|I am a middle school English teacher and enjoy reading Young Adult literature. I also have seen the Twilight Zone episode, with a very similar story line, and it was an episode that has lingered hauntingly in my thoughts....so when I heard of this series, I was very eager to read it. I don't frequently write reviews, but I had to react to the negative reviews that I saw on this site. Though the story line may not be original, the author writes beautifully, using specific vocabulary and beautiful similes, without, at least in my opinion, holding back the story line. Tally is a well-developed character, thoughtful and fully understanding the consequences of her actions. I saved this book for a three-day weekend but read it all last night and this morning. I was unable to put it down and am planning to read all three books this week. I highly recommend this book for readers who enjoy thinking about what our future will be like. I plan to share the first chapter with my Junior Great Books class. I think it will be great fodder for intellectual discussion.
0736063684|5.0|I'm doing a degree course where I need to know my muscles. This book is brilliant! The guy is a real artist, everything grouped logically and clearly. If you are learning anatomy, massage therapy, sports medicine, personal training or just want to work out intelligently this is the book to get.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I really liked the Theatrical version of this movie. The ending being the major difference between the two versions. The Theatrical ending I found more thought provoking and interesting than the Director's Cut version. One of the reasons I kept thinking about this movie days after I saw it was due to the Theatrical version's ending. I recently saw the Director's Cut version and it did not leave the same effect on me. I thought it still an interesting version but if I could only see one version or only know one story, it would be the Theatrical version.
B00005JPLW|1.0|This movie is one of the most racist films I have ever seen.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.
1878424114|5.0|This book was given to me 10 years ago. My life was transformed on the spot in the short time it took to read. I have read it no less than 8 times. I continue to keep copies on hand for gifts. My only regret is that I loaned out my original copy with all \\"my\\" footnotes and have yet to get it back. Thank you Dr. Chopra for your contribution to humanity.  Barb
B0000507QH|1.0|There are some who will look at this film as a deep and sensitive film looking into the psychology of sex and the need for one party to posess the other.  In reality this film is just pointless rubbish.<br /><br />2 hours of utter drivel.  This film is more like a sad parody of French cinema.  Middle aged teacher seeks out a former lover of a painter who he had met in a sleezy bar and helped save him from getting his head kicked in from not paying his tab.  The painter has since died and all our hero has left is a painting that he did.<br /><br />On finding the artists studio he meets up with his former lover and starts a relationship.  They have sex, then he sits for 10 minutes smoking and discussing the psychology of it all!  Thing is the daft prat cant quite understand why she cant wait to get away from him!  The film just carries on in the same way for the best part of an hour and a half if that is realy your idea of a good film you realy need to get out more.<br /><br />Check out L'appartement or the piano teacher and do yourself a favour and give this one a miss.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Take two parts Norah Jones, one part Tori Amos (without the scary lyrics), and one part Fiona Apple and you get one sweet mixture by the name of Sara Bareilles.      Her cd, Little Voice, from the first taste to the last drop is a serious bit of sultry, rockin', heart-felt music.  Sara keeps a good variety in her music going.  It's not all jazzy sweet (Love On The Rocks.. no, not the Neil Diamond song), let it out love song (Bottle It Up), I want your love song (Many The Miles), or love gone wrong song (Fairytale) standards.  Music, lyrics, and her amazing voice will mesmerize you throughout it.  No 'boy bandish/same beat in every song' music here, people.    Her first single from the cd, Love Song, you wouldn't exactly categorize as one.  It's more along the lines of being for those who are second and third guessing their relationships.  See, folks?  Proof that there actually ARE beautiful women out there that know a bad relationship when they see one in their own lives.  :)     I saw her at a mini-performance and signing in San Francisco.  She sounds just as beautiful, if not moreso, in person as she does on the cd.   I had suggested to her to make One Sweet Love (my favorite) her second single from the cd.     Peter Gabriel would be wise to allow her to record her version of \\"In Your Eyes\\" on her next cd.  She sang it on KFOG (SF radio station) recently and was nothing short of wonderful.     Little Voice : the Bareilles martini: drink it all in and enjoy!
B000QUCNOK|5.0|I just wanted to say how much I thoroughly enjoyed Perfume. . .It's a shame it played about one weekend in my town, and I missed it in the theater.  The job of bringing this book to life was an amazing feat; to me masterfully accomplished--it left me with the kind of impressions and feelings I generally associate with having watched truly great cinema.<br />Many (if not most) of the negative reviews I see betray individuals who clearly didn't get it (let alone read the book) or those who brought personal issues to the movie, through which they should have been able to realize was of a type that they probably wouldn't enjoy, based on these frailties. Thank you for a challenging, disturbing, and generally excellent movie Mr. Tykwer.
B00002E23E|5.0|Led Zeppelin never got any better than this. There are videos available of their '75 and '77 tours as well as footage kicking around from the Knebworth festival, but this band peaked in 1973 and for those of us who fell out of love with the band by \\"In Through the Out Door\\" and Plant's wretched solo  material, this video is a great reminder of why Zep was a sold out huge arenas and sold millions of albums.  My faves are the title song with it's great 12-string and 6-string mix,John Paul Jones \\"No Quarter\\",the BEST solo on \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" available and an excellent show closer which I won't name in case you haven't seen this yet.  This is how it should be and how this band should be remembered.
0793518326|3.0|If you love the Beatles and love music - this is a must have.  It is beautiful looking in hard cover and slides into a nice protective sleeve.  The print is small and so tough to read.  A way around this would be to provide a CD or download capabiltiy with a password so a purchaser could print out a particular song.  I would have rated this a 5 with this included.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to own this -- plus I think its a pretty good value, but I would pay $10 more to be able to download the music or have a companion CD/DVD.
1571200851|5.0|This book kept me up all night, making beautiful little flowers. Lots of inspiration! While the directions were \\"pretty good\\" a showing of the right and wrong side of the fabric would have been helpful, but a small amount of imagination and manipulation worked wonders.
B000QXDED6|1.0|Allan Smithee where are you when we need you?   The good men and woman of theatre are in line around the block to sign a petition demanding the exile from the creative arts of the sanitation engineers and deli owners and bus drivers (not meaning any explicit defamation of the above, but deli owners should stick to salami) as well as the dentists who financed this monstrosity.    The chowder-headedness of the writers anoints them as master fisherman of the Grand banks.  Up in their nets came a central character so vapid, so dull, so unimaginative (the hunky Leonidas)  he can't imagine himself as either the rescuer or the plunderer of the pulchritudinous oracle held captive by the grotesque ephors - unless we see their deformity as a projection of his own jealousy for the sexual license they have granted themselves.    No, to make this movie come right one would need to focus it on Ephialtes, the terribly deformed ex-Spartan who yearns for a impossible social approval any man in his right mind who be too proud to want. (Internal Conflict #1).  And on the friction between his need to be approved of by Persians and a proposed, rather vaporous loyalty to a crew that could not ever want him (Internal Conflict #2).    Well, it could be worse.  The folks who struggled over that other grand miscarriage, the Pirates of the Caribbean series probably realized (because most writers are college graduates) the mainspring of the story was the romance between Calypso and Davy Jones and how it explains a part of the dynamic in any romance between power and rejection - yet they burned their talent at the altar of special effects.  Ah, the compromises we make.    Am I the only person who thought Keira Knightly's face looks a little bland when magnified to the height of a movie screen.  And perhaps she lacks a little acting range?    But I did like the costumes and the art direction surrounding Xerxes and his slaves.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara Bareilles' album took 3 playings for me to go from \\"ehh it's pretty decent\\" to \\"wow this girl is talented\\".  She has just the right mix of lyrical ingenuity, eloquence, and wit, soul, a flair for pop-ridden hooks, and the vocal and piano chops to back it all up. I think the pop scene is really missing people of her caliber... I'd place her with the likes of Gavin DeGraw, with the artistic realness of Bright Eyes or Fiona Apple mixed with the pop-savvy Maroon 5.
0765348276|3.0|I'm not a hardcore reader of science fiction, but I've heard a lot of good things about John Scalzi, so I thought I would give this book I try.  I found OLD MAN'S WAR enjoyable, but surprisingly lightweight.<br /><br />This novel begins superbly.  The main character is a 75-year old man who has volunteered for military service.  He is very likable person, and the story begins with his enlistment and his transformation into a fighting machine.  All of this is fun, imaginative and very well done.  I had great hopes for the rest of this novel as a result.<br /><br />Unfortunately, OLD MAN'S WAR takes a bit of a tumble after the first third.  This book essentially becomes a military war story, and Scalzi does a subpar job of supplying any of the supporting characters with a distinct personality.  To a large degree, I found most of them rather boring and interchangeable.  There is a lot of action in this book, and a fair number of characters die, but I couldn't care less because I never really got to know any of them.  The result is a less than compelling read.<br /><br />There is also a ton of jokey dialogue in OLD MAN'S WAR, which I found rather jarring, given the serious themes that Scalzi seemed interesting in exploring.  I enjoy humor in a book, but not the sort of endless wisecracking that I found here.  As another reviewer commented, it's hard to believe any of these characters is 75 years old.  They sound more like a group of smart-alecky college kids, each trying to one-up the other in the joke department.<br /><br />That being said, Scalzi has a first-rate creative mind, and I enjoyed the world-building he did for OLD MAN'S WAR.  He also writes in a smooth style that's pretty easy to read, and the story moves at a fast clip.  Many of the fight scenes are well done.  I was able to finish this book, and I enjoyed it for the most part despite its flaws.<br /><br />Overall, OLD MAN'S WAR a good read, but the instant classic that some people have been claiming.  Lower your expectations, and you should have a good time with it.e a good time with it.
1592402690|4.0|I picked up this book to find out why the Beatles are so good, and I found all the answers I was looking for.  This book gave terrific insight to all four beatles and the camp that surrounded them, though my patience did wear thin towards the end- Emerick favors Paul, tends to repeat himself a little bit, and shows a little disdain towards Lennon and George Martin.  That being said, I really thoroughly loved the book as a music student and an audio engineering student, but any fan of music should read this to get a glimpse of the thrilling world that creates the music we all love.  I love understanding the context to the music I listen to, and if you do too you'll really enjoy this book.
B000OYC7A8|1.0|One of the reviewers wrote: \\"I love Roger Waters and David Gilmour for different reason but to come on here to Amazon and write reviews on anything involving David Gilmour in such a manner is insane\\"    Here's what's more insane: coming on here to amazon and writing reviews of a product that hasn't even been released. Come on people, wait until the DVD comes out, actually BUY it, actually WATCH it, THEN submit your impressions. Writing reviews based on how you hope it will turn out is just plain silly, not to mention misleading. I'm giving one star to even things out a bit.
B000J103WK|5.0|This album is bar far the best album I ever own. Both quality of sound and images are outstanding. My wife, friends and I listened several times this album and we are never tired of it....

B000R7I3LY|5.0|I heard Sara Bareilles on yahoo music, and was instantly hooked. So often, I like just one or two songs on a CD, so I feel like I've wasted my money. This was not the case with Little Voice. I love every single song on the CD. It's a great blend of upbeat and chill music, and her voice has a wonderful jazz/blues quality to it. I love the melodies, but, as dumb as this may sound, I love the lyrics just as much. They're almost like poetry if you read them on their own. Anyone who is a fan of the singer/songwriters like John Mayer, Josh Kelley and even Amy Winehouse will love this CD.
0767802470|5.0|The experiences of a U-Boat crew and the futility of war are extraodinarily well documented in this intense film that follows them from launch to return to port. The close quarters of a submarine crew are depicted and the bonding of men under pressure are timeless and cultureless themes. The men who manned Hitler's U-Boats were doing their duty and they had an incredibly insane assignment. This film captures men at war and the sacrifices they make in a way that will speak to any generation.<br />Extremely well-done.
B000NA28HU|5.0|great movie followed a great book closer than usual for a book from a movie//waiting for eldest(the movie)and the next book!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0385522401|5.0|This book was so good-packed with history and a message. I was captivated by it.<br /><br />He painted the political and social climate of the time in such a vivid manner. His insights were perfect and his historical detail was too good for words. He puts the reader back into 1962-even if the reader had not been born yet.<br /><br />It begins on the wedding night of two virgins, Edward and Florence. He's ready and willing to go, but she is filled with dread. She tries to have sex with Edward out of a sense of wifely duty.<br /><br />Their childhoood's are related. She is raised by emotionally distant parents, Violet and Geoffrey; and he is reared by a handicapped mother and a over-whelmed father. Both Edward and Florence try to escape their past lives with their marriage.<br /><br />The ending was sad, and, I was surprised. This book is worth reading-it is a historical treasure and tells an interesting and perplexing story.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Over 30 years later, it's still hard to believe this is a debut album. It's easy to just dismiss this band as an example of the corporate rock of the 70's that punk rebelled against, but the extreme high quality of the music here makes this a must purchase CD.  There's the \\"big three\\" of course, \\"More Than A Feeling,\\" \\"Peace of Mind\\" and \\"Long Time,\\" which, even if that's all Boston ever recorded, would be enough to get them daily airplay 30 years later. The other songs are just as strong, if not as well known. \\"Hitch a Ride\\" and \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\" are my favorites. All in all, no fillers here. The remastered version of this CD is perfect. Ignore the negative reviews of this band. This is a classic rock essential.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD. The CD in its entirety is excellent. From the musical arrangement to the vocals you can't go wrong. Brandi has a lovely voice and I can't wait for the next one. Highly recommend.
B000000ISO|5.0|This review pertains to the MFSL CD of Third Stage. As of the date of this review, it is selling in used condition for $45 to $75. All I can say is I wouldn't sell mine for three times that.    This classic work by a classic band is enhanced dramatically by the Mobile Fidelity treatment. From the opening guitar of \\"Amanda\\" to the closing strains of \\"Holly Ann,\\" this is an absolute study of how to engineer perfection.    The music is the key, though, with Brad Delp never sounding better, and Tom Scholtz proving his genius again and again. If you don't own the MFSL version of this CD already, buy one today, because MFSL is gone, and these will never be made again.
1594489505|5.0|Probably the most impressive way that Hosseini has written his sophmore book is that it's written from the perspective of two woman.  Almost everything you read from the third world (and war stories) is written from the man's side.  It's difficult for men to write from a woman's perspective, but he has done a fabulous job of it.      The story itself follows the two woman as they live their lives amid the horror and destruction that has been Afghanistan for the last forty years.  What is impressive is his description of the place of woman during the time of the last monarchy and it's comparison to life under the communist and Taliban governments.  Bottom line, that for woman, though things got progressively worse, it wasn't that great to start with for most woman.  Except for the main cities of Kabul and Herat, most woman in the country- side would have had difficulties in differentiating one government from the next.    Hosseini is at his best when describing the ongoing day-to-day humiliation that Afghani woman had to endure.  Though he does an interesting explana- tion of the pros and cons of wearing a \\"burqa\\", in that it's both a 'cell' as well as 'protection'.  The random killings and brutalization of woman during the Taliban government is past understanding for most westerners, but it's done without sentimentality and hand wringing.  Lastly, the ability of human beings to find hope during the most trying of times speaks volumes.
B000EQ47HC|5.0|The perception is that this was a disappointing follow-up to their spectacular debut. However, if you listen to it today, without the unfair comparisons to the first album, you realize this is just more great music from an underrated, overcritized band.   Ironically, the biggest complaint about the album when it came out was that it took \\"so long\\" for them to release their second album. It was only 2 years! Now, a lot of bands go five years between releases.  The centerpiece of the album, for me is \\"A Man I'll Never Be.\\" This brilliant, gut-wrenching\\" song is especially poignant now with the suicide of lead singer Brad Delp. Fortunately, Brad lives on forever in this incredible vocal.
031286504X|5.0|This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi/Horror novels ever written. Richard Matheson wrote TV & film screenplays (such as Duel) as well as writing his own novels. He wrote The Shrinking Man that The Incredible Shrinking Man was based on.<br /><br />The story has already had two filmed versions of it made (Last Man on Earth and The Omega Man) and another is to be realeased shortly. George Romero's zombie movies were surely influenced by the novel as well. As can be gathered from the above one man remains alive and 'normal' and fights to survive against the ever increasing numbers pitted against him.<br /><br />What is pitted against him, and how the story resolves (I can't tell you...) at the end is very cleverly done and in my admittedly limited litary experience quite unique. This is very well written and easy to read. If you don't believe me ask Stephen King who rates this highly.
0143038095|3.0|When I recieved my list of Summer 2007 reading assignments, I'll come right out admit that I chose to read Amy Tan's \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" for the simple reason that I actually heard of it. I went in not expecting much, and came out with my feelings confirmed.<br /><br />I do understand that this book is often regarded as a classic, but I for the life of me can't say this book being anything more than merely average. Tracing the life of a group of Asian families whose head leader has passed on, leaving her daughter with the unpleasant task of filling her shoes, \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" deals with topics such as death, family, marriage, divorce and togetherness. All of which are intriguing at first, but ultimately amount to little.<br /><br />The book overall lacks a cohesive flow. I found myself confused at many points in the book to the point where it was useless for me to even try to even pay attention to the book. Tan's writing style is also very simplistic, lacking any real originality and leaving very little to the imagination.<br /><br />Overall, I can't for the life of me see why this book is as highly regarded as it is. Perhaps it's just not my type of book. Nonetheless, I am befuddled as to why it is a classic piece of literature.
141694740X|5.0|I love this book so much. I am very happy I purchased it. It's nice to hear a male's perspective on things; one that makes so much sense. This book is very helpful for single women and non-single women. For now on I will be able tell if he really is \\"Just Not That into Me\\" instead of guessing, assuming, or making excuses for him. I won't as Greg says, \\"waste the pretty.\\"
0060573775|5.0|In my \\"old age\\", I've taken up listening to audio books on my MP3 player while doing brain dead activities.  Because 2007 is the Year of Vonnegut in central Indiana and because of his recent passing, I'm revisiting Vonnegut's books that I had read while in college.  Slaughterhouse Five may be better now than it was then.  However, that's a chicken and egg arguement.  And it's an opinion based on a lifetime of experience. Nevertheless, Vonnegut's writings are just as timely now as they were when he first penned them.    Unfortunately, only a few of KV's books have been burned on CD's.  Hopefully more will show up soon.    After the end of the reading, there's an interview with KV where he explains that Billy Pilgrim is NOT him, but was based on someone else he knew while in WWII.
0060589469|5.0|This is one of those books I always thought I should read and when I finally got around to it I was blown away. I am reminded of catcher in the rye and one... cuckoos nest. This book was not what I expected. It is not about motorcycles or philosophy, it is about people. The story is skillfully woven between these elements. This is not a book you read once. This is not a book though, to escape from thinking. If that's what you need try Matthew Riley.

B00000I8UK|5.0|After listening to this recording, it was clear Dolphy more than successfully honed his distinct musical purpose.  He created music worthy of inclusion into the musical canon.  \\"Outward Bound\\" seemed like Dolphy transitioning from his Mingus days to his own style.  \\"Out There\\" was a loose, fuzzy progression toward the \\"Out to Lunch\\" recording.  \\"Out to Lunch\\" is much, much tighter and fully focused.  There is not one unessential note on the entire cd.  Dolphy's phrases are more exquisitely expressive than ever, with his juxtaposition of low and high notes and \\"animal sounds\\".  Dolphy is a refreshing change from other heavyweights like Davis and Coltrane, because his does not have an intensely dramatic style.  He is down to earth, someone who could describe the average joe's day in a beautiful song.  His tone and technical virtuosity gets your attention, but he is not abrasive with either one, a pleasing trait very similar to Parker.  As a Monk fan, I would have to say my favorite track on this album is \\"something sweet, something tender,\\" largely because it is blues-laden, just like all Monk's music.  And, like Monk, there is humor in his music, a kind of poking fun at grandiose melodrama, as the lazy chorus drags on \\"something tender, something sweet.\\" Jocularity is also evident in the humorously uneventful title and cover.  One can easily note after the first listen that \\"Out to Lunch\\" would not have been as monumental as it became without Hubbard, Hutcherson, Davis and Williams creating a moody, rich environment for Dolphy.  This is an essential record.

Every book of this quality and with a similar contents may help to stop the tide of idiocy proposed by supporters of creationism in America.Only by spreading real science we will escape becoming the richest but also the most primitive intellectually nation in the world.

B000003CM9|5.0|UPDATED FOR 3 CD/Blu-ray Combo):<br /><br />From the melodic opening lines of &quot;Revival&quot; to the closing strains of &quot;Leave My Blues Alone&quot; this is one of the best albums The Allman Brothers Band ever created. The band has, of course, created other masterpieces but this is the first album where everything comes together from the top notch playing by Duane and Dickey to Greg's bluesy growl. Most of the tracks from this album have became the bedrock of the band's concerts (and a good portion of this album formed the basis for the classic and seminal live album &quot;Live at the Fillmore East&quot;).<br /><br />&quot;Idlewild South&quot; has been remastered a number of times for CD but the best versions to purchase are the early edition mastered by Dennis Drake where Drake doesn't futz with the sound but presents the music naturally without compression or altering the sound of the original mastertape. Drake's remaster can usually be found used. If you see the &quot;Capricorn Remasters&quot; on the inlay card of the CD, this isn't the one remastered by Drake. You'll find a copy of Drake's remaster used in all probablility and its one of the original issues of the CD.<br /><br />So, the latest version of &quot;Idlewild South&quot; is a three CD, Blu-ray combo. The first CD is the original album with out takes of &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; , &quot;One More Ride&quot; and an alternate take of &quot;In Memory of Elizabeth Reed&quot; and an alternate mix of &quot;Midnight Rider&quot; closed out with the mono single edit of &quot;Revival&quot;.<br /><br />The second and third discs are an expanded version of &quot;Live at Ludlow Garage&quot;. This features a 15 minute take of live take of &quot;Reed&quot;that wasn't on the previous version of the release.<br /><br />Finally the Blu-ray disc includes a wonderful 5.1 mix of the album that sounds terrific. I had hoped that the BD disc might have footage from an early concert but that's not the case. Nevertheless, this is a terrific set.<br /><br />Unlike the the Allman Brothers Band &quot;Fillmore Concerts&quot; multidisc set, this set packages all of this in an inexpensively designed cardboard artwork. The discs slide into the cardboard . It's not a problem for the multi-disc set but for this one, it just doesn't give sufficient protection for the CDs in the set (the Blu-ray, on the other hand, is much better resiliant.<br /><br />There's a booklet (the artwork more than doubles the heighth of digipak artwork (and this is an extension of th digipak) and the cheaper packaging compared to the hardback book version, is a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The best version, however, is the newly released version from Mobile Fidelity (which is back in business with new owners after going out of business in the early part of the 21st century). Mastered by Shawn R. Britton the album has never sounded this warm, rich or good on CD. If you can find the Britton remaster (google Music Direct or go to the Mobile Fidelity website)which was released in a limited, numbered edition in a replica of the original album sleeve, I'd snatch it up. It's possible some independent retailers are carrying it (sadly amazon.com is not and I'm not quite sure why perhaps its is sold out). Britton also did the marvelous remaster of Linda Ronstandt's &quot;Dont Cry Now&quot; and is also doing a remaster of a seminal Little Feat album).<br /><br />Pick up this classic album you won't be sorry. If you can't find the Britton remaster go for the marvelous Drake (Drake also did early versions of &quot;Beginnings&quot; the album that combines this album with their first).

0307277887|5.0|Dexter Morgan. He's a highly respected lab technician specializing in blood spatter for the Miami Dade Police Department. He's a handsome, though reluctant, ladies' man. He's polite, says all the right things, and rarely calls attention to himself. He's also a sociopathic serial killer whose \\"Dark Passenger\\" drives him to commit the occasional dismemberment.<br />Mind you, Dexter's the good guy in this story.<br />Adopted at the age of four after an unnamed tragedy left him orphaned, Dexter's learned, with help from his pragmatic policeman father, to channel his \\"gift,\\" killing only those who deal in death themselves. But when a new serial killer starts working in Miami, staging elaborately grisly scenes that are, to Dexter, an obvious attempt at communication from one monster to another, the eponymous protagonist finds himself at a loss. Should he help his policewoman sister Deborah earn a promotion to the Homicide desk by finding the fiend? Or should he locate this new killer himself, so he can express his admiration for the other's \\"art?\\" Or is it possible that psycho Dexter himself, admittedly not the most balanced of fellows, is finally going completely insane and committing these messy crimes himself?<br />Despite his penchant for vivisection, it's hard not to like Dexter as his coldly logical personality struggles to emulate emotions he doesn't feel and to keep up his appearance as a caring, unremarkable human being. The plot is tense and absorbing, but it's the voice of Dexter and his reactions to the other characters that keeps me reading the Dexter series, as well as making it one of the most original and highly exciting serial killer stories in a long time.

B000002J2B|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - At the time this album was released, Genesis was in serious doubt, as frontman Peter Gabriel went from the band (because of the birth of his first daughter) a great part of the band's intelligence, hability and unique style went with him, and as they placed drumer Phil Collins as the band's new lider and new singer, as you may have noticed this similar spectatives in Selling England By The Pound where he sings More Fool Me, and still Phil Collins ability was yet to be proven, as he barely composed 1 or 2 songs in the album, but even though going against the flow, Genesis' hability as a band went incredibly high in this album! Even becoming bassist Mike Rutherford favourite album, and although Collins, Rutherford and Banks themselves ended up turning Genesis into a bastardized pop band, this album keeps the most fresh originality and a fierceful, intricate mood that can change anyone's point of view by hearing to it. Along with A Trick Of The Tail and certain pieces of Duke, Phil Collins and his other bandmates made out of Genesis a still respectable band, focusing on his music, applying emotion and interest, as it can be seen in Wind And Wuthering. I like it so much that I can tell few Gabriel era's albums worst than this one, as they focused on such an intricate mood that is very hard to find, the album even in its slight sounds experimentations, like romantic ones, its notorious their interest, displayed talent and musical genious. Myself, one who really dislikes Phil Collins got to say that his talent was best shown when he started to saw the opportunities, unlike Gabriel which saw best his interests later on.<br /><br />Wind And Wuthering marks a special point of transition in which most of the bandmates where starting to put on paper a very slight touch of their musical interests, as it can be seen the album is not as complex, heavy or too of a cerebral release, it assumes a fantastic side of progressive rock, a very original and expected one, as the albums assume a lighter but very moody structure in its compositions. Don't get fooled, Wind And Wuthering is a progressive rock album, not expressed in their most recognizable and pure way, but in a different side of it, and along their noticed interests there's an inclinnation of both Banks and Rutherford for romantic songs, yet the romantic songs in the album are complex and intricate, and an instrumental but very moody and powerful interest from Phil Collins, which later can be seen in such of his outside works like his band Brand X, where he explodes his percussion hability to the top. Sadly, Steve Hackett's best interest where in still playing that recognizeable side of prog, where he could be noticed as adding a touch of beauty to the compositions, so I assumed he thought he was the only one wich kept his interests and made Wind And Wuthering his last album with Genesis. The album's moods range between delicate, intricate, light and emotional to powerful, fierceful, and undertaking.<br /><br />The album's songs have all their similarities but still each possess key differences and special moments, each of them keeps the similarity of being beautiful and original, and this is one of Genesis' albums in which there is a lot to recommend or remark, as in here my best recommendations are focused on 5 songs: the album's initial expectative starts with Eleventh Earl Of Mar, which is their first truly experimentation, is still such an enjoyable and moody song, in which the changing phases in its musical performance and the freaky mood on Collins' vocals, I view it as a slight memory and tribute to Peter Gabriel original style of singing in such an emotional way, and I recalled certain songs like Get'Em Out By Friday and The Battle Of The Epping Forest, and as the song ends then comes the second track, One For The Vine, which is a serious, profound, delicate and emotional song, and I mainly characterized by the styles' similarity with A Trick Of The Tail, plus being the best song of the album and the one which I recommend most, but later it goes to the third track Your Own Special Way, here is where Rutherford's light, romantic interests are best shown as he composed it alone, which is mainly their very first romantic song, while many would critisize it as being a weak song, it is everything but weak, yes its a romantic one but its perfect moods and cohersion makes it another strong recommendation, its their best love song I've heard from them, and after passing by Wot Gorilla? it arrives the musical piece of All In A Mouse's Night, which is a thematic song about a mouse and its short adventure in going for something to eat in the house, its a very interactive song which keeps a light, story telling basis very comfortable for even kids, and of course it'll be appreciated because of its strong progressive aspects and thematic, good natured moods; and the last of my track pick but not the least, Blood On The Rooftops, its one of their most bright and focused compositions of all time, possessing a fierceful emotional content and a focused, touchy instrumentation, athough I would had preffered them to made it a little bit longer, it mixes Collins' fresh and hopeful talent with Hackett's strong and somber passion. The rest of the song are yet extraordinary, not as recognizeable as these 5 but still fantastic, like the catchy and attention keeper instrumental piece Wot Gorilla?, the big Hackett's momentum in the undertaking instrumental Unquiet Slumbers For The Sleepers, the prelude instrumental to Afterglow which is ...In That Quiet Earth, which is nothing but quiet is fast paced and powerful, and the dramatic but mellow sensitive and mellodic touch of Afterglow, which is a song that is revealed by its title; an afterglow. Track Pick: Eleventh Earl Of Mar, One For The Vine, Your Own Special Way, All In A Mouse's Night, Blood On The Rooftops.<br /><br />Among The Artists Phil Collins' voice is, of course, impossible to compare with Peter Gabriel, although its still fine, and his notorious percussion is also fantastic on this album. Mike Rutherford's bass performance is one of his greatest and most inspirational, as this is his favourite album. Tony Banks' overwhelming keyboards have their special moments in songs like Eleventh Earl Of Mar, and his organ performance its still present; maybe the last album in which his organ its present. Steve Hackett's guitar performance is still very nice but not as notorious as in his past Genesis' works, and I understand that as he may had not like the way the band was taking, so he quited to Genesis after this album, what a pitty.<br /><br />In conclussion Wind And Wuthering keeps its place in my favourite albums of all time, a certain 5 stars option and the best album to see the best spark of Genesis' real talent with Collins, and along with A Trick Of The Tail this album is their best of the Collins' era.song of the album and the one which I recommend most, but later it goes to the third track Your Own Special Way, here is where Rutherford's light, romantic interests are best shown as he composed it alone, which is mainly their very first romantic song, while many would critisize it as being a weak song, it is everything but weak, yes its a romantic one but its perfect moods and cohersion makes it another strong recommendation, its their best love song I've heard from them, and after passing by Wot Gorilla? it arrives the musical piece of All In A Mouse's Night, which is a thematic song about a mouse and its short adventure in going for something to eat in the house, its a very interactive song which keeps a light, story telling basis very comfortable for even kids, and of course it'll be appreciated because of its strong progressive aspects and thematic, good natured moods; and the last of my track pick but not the least, Blood On The Rooftops, its one of their most bright and focused compositions of all time, possessing a fierceful emotional content and a focused, touchy instrumentation, athough I would had preffered them to made it a little bit longer, it mixes Collins' fresh and hopeful talent with Hackett's strong and somber passion.

B000N3AXQU|5.0|This Movie is an absolutely amazing film that captures the heart and soul of the original Rocky movie with a fight scene at the end that makes for the best and most realistic Rocky fight to date. The clarity of the video and audio is nothing short of outstanding on the blue ray disc and makes this movie look and sound even better than it did during its theatrical run at the cinemas. Go get this movie now! Its a heart warming story sure to keep on inspiring for ages to come....Rocky Balboa Is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
B00004VW35|3.0|So Neil the rockabilly revivalist is out, and Neil the lonesome harmonica player is in: this is a \\"real\\" country album. Not country-rock like Gold Rush or American Stars `n' Bars, not country-folk like Harvest. No, now he's playing straight-up country, slathering on the pedal steel and subsequently ruining \\"Once an Angel\\", which actually could've been a nice stride-piano song. He goes overboard with fiddle on \\"The Wayward Wind\\" and \\"California Sunset\\", which are embarrassing; and gonzo with steel guitar and banjo on \\"Get Back to the Country\\", which isn't much better. \\"Misfits\\" is also totally overblown, and the grating string arrangements get to me by the second chorus. However, a couple of these tracks are quite entertaining, like the hilarious, self-deprecating title track (once you can get past Neil's vocals); \\"Old Boy\\", which is oddly touching even if it's loaded with all kinds of country gimmicks; and \\"Are There Anymore Real Cowboys\\", if for nothing else than the cuteness (which differs from cutesiness) factor, and the moderately long country-folk track \\"Bound for Glory\\", which is wonderfully unpretentious. Oh, and I like the piano on \\"Where is the Highway Tonight?\\". Just the piano, though. I'm not a country fan, but in my mind nobody can play country like Neil Young, so my personal biases filter through, clash, and kill each other. I used to think this was an awful record - I don't anymore, I can see that it has its moments and is much better than most of Neil's other '80s genre adventures (Life; Landing on Water; This Note's for You). In fact, it's my second-favorite '80s Young record, behind the wonderful Freedom. However, this isn't After the Gold Rush, that's for sure, and too often it sounds like a parody of the music it's paying homage to.
B00004YA66|5.0|This is such an enjoyable movie on many levels:  The time-warp aspect, the suspense of the story line and the importance of family ties.<br />Everyone I know who has seen this movie says it is a favorite of theirs.  I have to say it ranks at the top of my favorite list.  I would highly recommend it.
1416523359|1.0|It can't be easy to write a book and perhaps I am not sophiticated enough for this ongoing bizarre prose, but I had to finally give up mid-page 155.  Actually I fell asleep on p. 30 or so and then again about page 50.    It's not that I'm stuck on his old stuff so much that I cannot get into something new.  I really was looking forward to this read.  The account of the shooting, the call or her sister's episode wasn't even creepy.  I found myself actually skipping pages in order to get some meat out of it.  It was then I realized that I was truly slogging through this thing.    Sorry Mr. King.  The Stand is my favorite book of all time and I ever read the expanded edition with rapt attention.  This book didn't hold mine.  WTH ... blood bool smucking?????    I'm sure there was a story there, but I can't find it under all the gratuitous verbal diarrhea.  Maybe it's because I couldn't care less what happens to Lisey or what happened to Scott.  The flashbacks and her musings and internal thoughts were unbelievably disjointed.  I gave it one star because I guess I just expected so much more.  How I loved The Langoliers, Cujo, It, The Talisman and Wolf! with the glasses and overalls God-pound it!    Stephen King can make me believe that parallel worlds are a sip of purple juice away or that kids have the power to fight an ancient evil or that creatures eat up used time.  I was hoping something would get Lisey so she would just SHUT UP!  The guy that tore the endless strips of paper had more depth.  Please!  Where is the magic?    I'm going to read some Margaret Atwood now or Rutherfurd.  Sheesh!
B000PUXCQY|3.0|It still gets 3 stars for the choice of material to be included, however be warned that picking this up as Amazon Unbox, it's only 70 minutes long.  The DVD is 170 minutes!  I'm glad I used my Amazon $15 credit for Unbox, otherwise I'd be extremely unhappy.    As for Yes themselves, one of the interesting thing with this band as they age is how they hone the material.  You rarely see them play a song the same way twice, which is a good thing.    Let's all hope they can get their act together to actually record & tour again in the next year or two.  In the meantime, check out the new Yes-related band Circa, featuring Billy Sherwood, Alan White, Tony Kaye, & Jimmy Iovine!
B00008BXJF|3.0|Addictive music provided by Robert Fripp (guitar), Adrain Belew (guitar and vocals), Trey Gunn (Warr Guitar) and Pat Mastelotto (electronic drums). The first time I heard this I had to instantly play the whole CD over again. Now I am not entirely new to King Crimson and their many personnel formations and I have my own favorite combinations, but this one will do nicely. Fripp is in strong form as ever with his syncopated guitar virtuosities while Belew offers one his best songs \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" and humorous lyrics on \\"Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With\\". Gunn and Mastelotto are excellent in the rythem section with Gunn making some really gut grabbing sounds with his Warr guitar! I won't disect this album song by song only to say I like the whole disc and the song \\"Dangerous Curves\\" really gets me going with its ever building tension somewhat remeniscent of Gustav Holst's \\"Mars\\" from The Planets. This building theme reoccurs in other Fripp tunes as well. I know ther are those who miss Bill Bruford, but I think Pat Mastelotto does an excellent job on drums. We get to hear Fripp's soundscapes working their way into these tunes and its sometimes hard to distinguish what is creating the sounds and I find that half the fun with listening to King Crimson. Where do those sounds come from? In closing, this is another classic King Crimson album that should rank up there with some of the oldies like Lark's Tongue in Aspic and Discipline. This would be a fine starting place for those unfamiliar with King Crimson. I would also recommend Cirkus for starter Crimsonites. Warning - Once you hear this album, you will be hungry for more King Crimson. The good news is there is plenty of good music from this ever changing band and this album ranks among their best, IMO. - Ciao
B000PY52EU|4.0|I'm a big fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L Jackson, so despite or because of the soft porn material I found this movie very entertaining. Both stars do not disappoint in their roles and Justin Timberlake gives a believable performance as a wacky boyfriend. Since the \\"Blues\\" and hard luck love, sex in this case, seem to go hand in hand the mixture in this film seems like a good fit. Samuel L's guitar playing is a big suprise and overall the music is great.
0765316889|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has an amazing talent for misdirection. After finishing the book I had to sit and stare at the cover for a good long while, trying to come to grips with the twist at the end, setting us up for the last book in the series. It wasn't just at the end though. Brandon put an amazing number of reveals throughout the novel. Several times I stopped to think about how much cooler the world was with the new information. The world of Mistborn is deep and colorful. The characters are believable. And I thought the romance was well done, especially with the lack of sex.  That all being said, Mistborn: The Well of Ascension was not as complete a novel as the Final Empire. It didn't leave me feeling finished. I felt vaguely disquieted. I expect that Brandon will use this low to shove us to a new height in the next novel, which luckily will come out in not to long!
1582701709|5.0|I have read material in the past about some of the topics in this book, but The Secret relays the information in such a direct style. It is an awesome book and one that EVERYONE could benefit from. It allows a person to think about topics that she/he would not -- in a normal day-- ponder about and I recommend it to all readers. Your positive thoughts do affect both you and everyone around you. Learn how to use these thoughts for your best benefit!
B00005JPHT|5.0|This movie says a lot. It says of course that England has socialized medicine. It also explores medicine in Canada, France and Cuba. The point of 'Sicko' is that it's definitely time for The United States to catch up with the rest of the world.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I don't know why there is such negative press about an album that has some really nice rock songs and that plays as a concept album like many great rock albums of the 70's.  That Kelly chose to move in this direction goes to show that she is more than a cookie-cutter pop singer.  I don't know why Clive doesn't think that there are good hooks on this album.  \\"One Minute\\" has hooks remeniscent of \\"Walkaway,\\" and I think that it will be a hit if released as a radio single.  I believe that Kelly will go on to conquer a number of musical genres, including country (after watching her with Reba on CMT Crossroads).      I would recommend this album to anyone that enjoys good rock and one of the truly great voices of our time.
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|I am a great fan of one of the rightful kings of comedy, the late, great Jack Benny.  He is featured at his wry best, here, along with the stunningly beautiful Carole Lombard--the last film she made before she tragically died in a plane crash.  The title is based on the famous \\"To Be, Or Not To Be\\" soliloquy in William Shakespeare's HAMLET.  A troupe of actors in Nazi-occupied Warsaw must get by on their ability as thespians to elaborately (and effectively) disguise themselves, as well as adapt new identities, in order to fool the occupying troops.  Jack Benny is hilarious and Carole Lombard is gorgeous and charismatic.  Don't miss out on this.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|If you loved the old LP  you will not like this album.     LP has slowed things down and now sounds similar to Candlebox. Don't get me wrong, I love Candlebox but I don't like LP trying to be sound like them.
0930289234|5.0|When this epic first appeared in book form twenty years ago (and I first read it when it was new), it singlehandedly revolutionized the meaning of \\"comic book\\" and invented the \\"graphic novel\\" as we now know it. There are as many intertwined plotlines here as in a thousand-page blockbuster novel. At the opening of the story, the setting is the U.S. in 1985 -- sort of. Richard Nixon appears to be in his fifth term, thanks to a constitutional amendment, and the Vietnam War was won with the assistance of a handful of costumed adventurers, only one of whom has actual super-powers. In fact, much of the story is taken up with examining what happens to caped and masked crimefighters when they get too old to do their thing. (It's a well-worn theme now, but this book invented it.) And it's beginning to seem as if someone is arranging the disposal or de-fanging of the masked ones. The narrative is not only broad, though, it has considerable depth, including the backstories of all the major heroes and heroines, how they got into the business and why, what they have in common psychologically, and allowing them to be aware of just how oddball they are, compared to the rest of society. The artwork is realistic (which I prefer, frankly), with enormous subtlety in the flow and the continuity -- beginning with the cover illustration and ending with the last page of the last chapter. Neat little details peek out from the corners of many of the panels, bits of earlier dialogue come to mind later on, and Moore knows the value of modified repetition in telling a story effectively. This is a book you will want to reread every few years, and I guarantee you'll discover something new every time. A true masterpiece.
0070511136|5.0|SPIN is a classic, one of the books that revolutionized professional selling. It amazes me to read some of the negative reviews of this book posted here. Some of this I attribute to lack of knowledge of the history of our \\"profession,\\" which bears few hallmarks of being a profession yet. Can you get a four year college degree in SELLING, the one thing every business must do well to survive, let alone prosper? Except for programs at a small handful of universities around the country, the answer is NO. Do we have peer-reviewed journals in our profession? NO. Do we have accepted standards and professional certification? NO.     What Neil Rackham, a behavioral researcher, did for selling was huge. He applied the techniques of research and analysis to our profession. Until then, no one could say definitively that \\"always be closing\\" was bad advice. But in business to business selling, in high-tech selling to educated professionals, the \\"ABC's of selling\\" is only one of many pieces of bad information that passed for \\"wisdom\\" before Rackham showed them up for what they were. Such sales tactics are the reason salespeople have been saddled with negative stereotypes.    Some reviewers condemn Rackham by saying that companies cited, such as Kodak, IBM, and Xerox have suffered business reversals since this book came out. Sorry folks, but good salespeople using good selling techniques will not, alone, save your company. MANY companies that were at the top of their industries in the 1970s and 1980s are either out of business or have suffered serious reversals in the years since. That is a different issue altogether, and if you are looking for explanations try STRATEGY books like \\"Good to Great\\" by Jim Collins or \\"Strategy\\" by Michael Porter. Someone on this site said that IBM's loss of computer business to other PC makers was evidence of the failure of SPIN...totally ridiculous. IBM passed on the operating system that became DOS, which in turn became the engine fueling MicroSoft's ascent to the heights. In hardware manufacturing IBM ignored lots of evidence that a paradigm shift was underway and PCs were becoming commodity items.    The negative reviewers are looking for a silver bullet in many cases: SPIN will not transform you into a president's club winner by reading it. It is how you apply and practice it that will enable your success. Becoming expert in the use of this simple framework requires work and thought. What Rackham showed us is that the WORDS we use are important, along with HOW WE USE THEM. We must understand THEIR goals and focus on being part of THEIR success if we are to be successful in a sustainable, long-term partnership. Also that we must not be manipulative or treat other people (aka \\"customers\\" or \\"prospects\\") in ways we would not want to be treated ourselves. The acronym \\"SPIN\\" was coined before Washington politicians gave the word the negatie connotation it now has.     SPIN is not the only good refenence book for salespeople, but it is a landmark book, the result of research that has not, to my knowlege, been replicated since. It should be a held in great esteem by any sales professional. Rackham's concept of an \\"Advance\\" as an objective way to measure the progress of a sales call is, alone, worth the price of this book.    By the way, I have been in sales for 30 years, as a salesperson, sales manager, and director of training for a Fortune 500 company. I still have a lot to learn. But one thing I do know: there is tremendous value in this book for any salesperson with an open mind and the desire to continue growing, learning and improving as a sales professional.
B000RJO578|4.0|\\"Hot Fuzz\\" takes a while to really hit its stride, but eventually builds to a wonderful parody of action films -- think the climax of \\"Desperado,\\" as set in a bucolic English village.<br /><br />Lots of quality extras, as well. The tour documentary is especially worth a look.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of cop movies or British comedy. Heck, it'd even be worth a look for those Agatha Christie fans who enjoy a good action film, just to see the two collide so wonderfully here.
B00009UW0N|5.0|I recently got back from the worst remake and probably movie ever made, Rob Zombie's Halloween. After about twenty minutes or so of that movie, I longed for this movie. Everything in this movie was perfect: The score, the actors and actresses, the setting seemed like a real home town, the gore was minuim but effective, and the story was good. There is no reason on Earth that anyone would hate this movie. If you prefer the other film over this classic, then you need to grow up.
B0000075WM|5.0|I love Vixen! Back in the days of men rockin' out dressing a little like women here we have the best female rock band ever! They had the hair... they had the moves... they had the talent! They could play with the big boys and keep up! They said in an interview once that as they were opening for the guys they'd sometimes come out to see if they were faking, but they weren't & they guys were shocked! They are amaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000000XBC|5.0|While most fans will be shocked by that, dont be. Vol 1 is a collection of fine music and probably some of the best American rock ever made. The problem is how many people actully know CCR beyond that. Vol 1 songs are played on radios thru out the world over and over again, while Vol 2 songs dont get much play.   Born on the Bayou, Night Time Is the Right Time, Wrote a Song for Everyone, Hello Mary Lou are just some of the amazing songs on the set. If your a true CCR fan you own this set or can at least name some songs off this cd.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|I usually do not like to state my opinions on matters concerning politics, but I feel I must this time. An inconvenient truth is a documentary that has Al gore spoon feeding you \\"facts\\" for over an hour.  The problem is that he has no credible sources in his list of experts at the end of the credits.  Not one of the scientist he states specialize in the climate change and geography.  Instead they specialize in chemistry and biology. It's as if Al gore is saying anything he wants and claimming these facts are cold hard evidence without proof!!!!! According to Mr. Gore there is no hope, and the world will become destroyed by rising sea levels.   How can the so many people believe Al Gores Pseudo-political garbage. Just because Al Gore said so, doesn't mean it is so.  I find it pathetic how everyone takes his claims so seriously.  Global warming is a natural occurence, and the main cause of C02 emmisions is not people!!!!  The main cause are volcanoes!!!!!  Infact we constitute a mere fraction perhaps under 1% of the worlds C02 emissions.  I'm not saying were not to blame here because we are. However, we are just speeding up an inevitable process that has occured throughout history.  Global warming will not destroy the world as Mr. Gore has said it is a natural process that we will be able to adapt to.  The world will not become submerged in a day or two people!!! It will take decades, and we will adapt accordingly.  We cannot stop this process even if we tried.  So please save yourself from Mr. Gore's unproven hocus pocus garbage.  Mr. Gore only wants to brainwash you into feeling insecure because he was a failure in politics.  Beause he was a failure he feels he must push the only thing he has left onto us. A parting gift of sorts from a loser who has nothing left but his ego and very \\"energy efficient lifestyle\\".
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Cast, story, locations, can't ask for anything more! Had one problem with my DVD package in that the spoken dialogue was at one sound level but ALL music performed was WAY louder. I had to ride the volume control to watch this great movie, and that is not right. I can't understand how/why they could have screwed things up so much with the audio and still released it for sale. Too bad that they are not forced to have recalls for product problems that are this bad. Do I have the only DVD set with this problem?
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|I can't agree more with the other reviews I've seen - I honestly think this is the funniest show to be on TV in a long time.  All 5 of the actors are hilarious, and they fit together so well.  I don't think I can single any one of them out because they are all SO funny.  I wasn't sure how they could top the first season, but they did.  I was watching the episode \\"Arrivederci, Fiero\\" at the gym when it aired and could NOT stop laughing out loud (which was somewhat embarrassing...).  Even the episodes that I don't consider my \\"favorites\\" get me laughing out loud, which for me is rare when I'm watching TV.  This is a fabulous season with some of the best HIMYM moments.  I can't wait to get the DVD and watch the special features!
B000002GQE|5.0|would you believe this is my sixth copy of this album?  That should tell you how much I enjoy it.  This is a truly valuable piece of art. It can relax a troubled mind or energize you when you're feeling a little sluggish.  I especially like Tuesday Afternoon.
0060888695|5.0|Sissy Spacek draws from her Texas roots and does a subtly superb performance of Harper Lee's masterpiece of coming of age in an age of intolerance - Alabama during the Great Depression.

1570627215|5.0|The first time i read siddartha i thought to myself , \\"how do i acquire such tranquility of mind, and soul?\\"  I have studied martial arts most of my life and i have been in the ring many times before,  even though there is a great deal of discipline that is acquired along with the teaching of the martial arts, one also acquires a sense of instinct, and instinct drives even the most disciplined martial artist to act brash and hot tempered, and through my hot bloodedness i found this book.  It is strange to think that such a simple act as reading the pages off of a book can instill such a serene sense in a person.  When ever i read this book no matter how angry i'am at the time, i can't help but smile peacefully at the perplexeties of everyday life and the meaningless of anger and agitation, this book truly is a spiritual journey all of its own. This novel contains, what is in my opiinion, one of the most profound messeges ever written, and that messege is that no life style is wrong or right, it is the beauty of the buhddist teaching, it does not discriminate nor show contempt, for your life style, no matter how vague, or exciting, or misled, is not an evil but a step towards knowledge and spiritual enlightment, every action in your life shaping the kind of person your going to become and some how shaping the people around you as well.  The path to true enlightment isn't leading the perfect life, its making mistakes, being human, and learning from ones transgressions.  I recommend this book to anyone who has ever fealt the call of the self, the yearning of the spirit, and the release of the mind.
B000TSIK14|4.0|Yes,I loved it!!! Being a fan of the Scorps since Blackout,this one ranks up there with the best. Big shame ,the way U.S. fans are with the Scorps.If this one was released back in the 80's,it would have gone platinum.Nowadays,forget  it.Bottom line is,I love it and am sure you will to.If you have been there for the Scorps through the 90's from the 80's,you should check this one out. It has the trademark rockers and ballads. Standouts are...Hour 1,The Game of Life,321,Love Will Keep Us Alive,We Will Rise Again,The Cross and Humanity.The latter being my favorite on the album along with 321,Love Will Keep Us Alive and THe Game of Life.It is rich in content and you will like it a lot.I purchased their album with a bonus track,\\"Cold\\",at a local record store, which is real good and should have been on the album anyway.I give it a solid 4.5 stars.It will amaze. Go buy it now!!!! Hopefully Klaus and the boys will be back again....I know I will continue to be there.
B000067DNC|5.0|This is an absolute must see for all SG-1 enthusiasts. Season two of Stargate, will not only explain more of what is going on but also sets the stage for what is to come for many seasons down the road. As always, the cast's performance is spot on and convincing, urging you to stay up later to watch, \\"just one more!\\" Definitely a keeper.
0440238609|5.0|The \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy is incredibly rich and imaginative (my favorite invention -- armored bears!).  It has characters about whom you will care deeply, there are topics that will make you think, and it is extremely well written.  This is fiction at its best!
B000V39KDO|5.0|Very few times does film do justice to literature. Yes, I called it literature. The Battle of Thermopylae is history at its best when ordinary men do the most extraordinary things and become what Legends are made of. This \\"history\\" was written in a \\"comic book\\" format which became \\"300\\".<br /><br />My husband, not a real \\"back that far\\" history buff saw it first. He told me I HAD to see this movie! I always did like my history \\"Ancient\\".<br /><br />The first time, the sheer spectacle of the movie's photography took my breath away. The second time I began to see details of the combat, armor, and battle scenes missed the first go round. The third time I began to pick up the play of emotions on the cast's faces and interplay between the characters. All I can say is so far, we've watched it 7 times and each time see things we missed.<br /><br />Some of you might be saying, \\"...7 times in a 24 hour rental? Surely not!\\"<br /><br />No. After the first time, we bought the movie as a permanent addition to our collection.<br /><br />It is VERY realisticaly \\"bloody\\" though. I would not reccommend this for younger children or even adults with queasy stomachs. There is also a bit of nudity in the harem scene. But if you are of sterner \\"adult\\" stuff, you NEED to see this movie.<br /><br />The fight scenes are wicked real and vicious showing the capabilities boasted through time to be had by Spartan warriors. There's also enough \\"hard bodies\\" in this to make most of you girls weak at the knees.<br /><br />Gerard Butler \\"TimeLine\\", \\"Reign of Fire\\", and \\"Phantom of the Opera\\"(new)<br />makes an impressive King Leonidas even with the Scottish lilt to his voice. Dominic West superbly portrays the bad guy we REALLY begin to hate.<br /><br />What else can I say? I saw it. I liked it. It now stands proudly in the rack with Gladiator, Troy, and Alexander.<br /><br />If you liked those others, you'll LOVE \\"300\\" as well!
0451216725|4.0|I don't understand why all the negative reviews. I found this book fast-paced and entertaining. It reminded me a lot of The Bourne Identity and Paycheck. Though not as good as The Bourne Identity, it was a very enjoyable read. Definitely a great beach or vacation read.   If you didn't like this book, give Ken Follett another chance-- read The Key to Rebecca. That's what got me hooked.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|People get ready to laugh and to dance.<br /><br />Happy Feet will reel you in and net you up so quickly you won't have time to breathe. The look is gorgeous. The characters are familiar ranging from Elvis to Marilyn Monroe. The music which starts from the \\"get go\\" will knock you off your feet. But don't worry, you'll be back up dancing on them in a flash.<br /><br />The storyline is well played out and has a message, but not rudely delivered. It is more hinted at as it unfolds.<br /><br />I reccommend this movie for all ages of music lovers, even if they NEVER cared much for or thought about penguins. You penguin lovers have a \\"whale\\" of a time coming.<br /><br />Pile all the kids and grandkids up, break out the \\"extra butter\\" popcorn cause this one is worth getting the good stuff out. Then, ya'll settle in for a foot stompin' time!

B000AL730O|4.0|\\"Chaos And Creation In The Backyard\\" finds Paul McCartney in a mellower, laid-back mode. No real rockers on this album, just pleasant melodies and exquisite playing, which will do just fine. McCartney plays most of the instruments himself, his songwriting is still equally sharp, and he still weaves a good story. Excellent songs include \\"Fine Line,\\" \\"Jenny Wren,\\" \\"English Tea,\\" and \\"This Never Happened Before.\\" But the standout song is easily \\"Riding To Vanity Fair,\\" a marvelously hypnotic confection and one of the finest songs Paul has ever written. But the whole album is highly enjoyable, a perfect disc to wind down with at the end of the day. I strongly recommend Paul McCartney's \\"Chaos And Creation In The Backyard.\\"
B000051Y0G|5.0|She burst onto the scene with her infectious music, wild hair, and sense of fun in the 1980's and in doing so Cyndi Lauper stole our hearts. She would appear with various artists for dozens of benefits, causes, and general good will. She not only sang but wrote music and could play many different instruments.  In this, her first album, Cyndi takes you on a powerhouse tour of her vocal talents early in her career. Here you will have the playful song, Girls just wanna have fun, the soulful, When you were mine, and the powerful, Money changes everything.  With an acceptance of being unusual and willingness to not do the normal Cyndi would make a name for herself. In her video for \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\" her mother and Captain Lou Albano from the WWF appear as her parents. She also has a cast of her friends sitting with her during the later part of the video. This first album gives us just a clue to the power and grace that would continue to grow in as her terrific career continues.       Your 80's music collection just isn't complete without this ground breaking record from a Diva hand picked by Cher for her final goodbye tour.
0060578793|1.0|No book this size can even come close to delivering what the title claims. There are indeed some good illustrations and pointers to go along with them, but a survival manual this is not. Great for a bar on a slow night or as a coffee table book.   Why one star??-------->     Two examples of shoddy research and/or lack of experience: The section on bow making is only twenty seven lines (it has a thirteen line introduction with a seven line description on how to actually make a bow. This is matched by seven more lines on how to fit the string to your new hunting weapon). Look at the Bowyers Bible, a set of three books on bow making by some of the best in the business.  The \\"Spear Thrower\\" section is flat wrong, illustrating that the author not only never made/used one before, but never saw one in use or otherwise. There are other shortfalls, but I'll keep the description to two. Don't believe me? Make one as described in the book or do a google search on \\"Spear throwers\\" or \\"Atlatl\\".     There are some things he describes well and clearly has experience with,  perhaps the publisher urged him to include things beyond his experience, but that does not excuse the inclusion of manufactured \\"facts\\" especially when the reader may be staking their life on that erroneous information.   All in all good for the survival book collection with a few good bits, but lacks too many details.     Remember when reading these reviews that it is often a case of the blind leading the blind as owners of newly purchased copies are not qualified to recognize if a skill is thoroughly covered.  Just because the table of contents lists a skill does not necessarily translate to the reader being able to accomplish the skill. Ask a survival school or instructor with real experience which book they would recommend. Any way you slice it, the skills must be practiced regardless of the book you buy, don't wait until you need a shelter to build one or a fire lit to attempt lighting it.

B000MZHW40|5.0|I think that this movie is the perfect blend of a documentary and an action-drama. Clearly the intent was to bring to the forefront the issue of conflict diamonds in Africa. But instead of going for a factual film, the creators decided to throw together a group of great actors and a set of interesting sidelines to the story, polishing it into a magnificent jewel. The issue at hand is the brutal slaughtering in several parts of Africa, especially Sierra Leone, related to the control of diamonds. The situation in the movie is best described as TIA (This is Africa), a political mess, where those that govern only want to steal for their own benefit, and where there is no way to help, not even for the peace corps.<br /><br />Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is a fisherman that dreams of his son, Dia, becoming a doctor and moving on to better things. This dream is stopped in its track when the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) comes to his village and brutally slaughters most of the inhabitants. Luckily, Solomon's family escapes, but the RUF captures him and takes him to work on the diamond fields as a slave. Meanwhile, politicians in the industrialized world are aware of the problem resulting from diamonds from conflict zones and there is an agreement not to buy them anymore. The big diamond houses in Europe and the US agree, but you probably know by now that they will go around it in one way or another.<br /><br />Then there is Danny (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is a local from Zimbabwe that gives arms to different guerrilla groups in exchange for diamonds and then smuggles them to Liberia, from where they can be imported into the consumer countries as conflict free rocks. When he is captured during one of his diamond operations, he is thrown in jail, where he meets Solomon. Solomon was in jail as a result of a raid of the RUF camp, but not before finding a big pink diamond that he hid underground. When the greedy Danny finds out about this, he makes sure that his future path is linked to Solomon's.<br /><br />Besides the greedy and unscrupulous Danny, and the moral Solomon, who just wants his family back, we have Maddy (Jennifer Connelly), a journalist that is frustrated by the situations she witnesses all around the globe and that wants her work to be effective in stopping the destruction. The three characters go through a journey of self-discovery while everyone around them is out to kill each other for the control of the diamonds. The situation is so bad that the different revolutionary groups kidnap and train children to join them. Seeing the transformation these young minds go through in a short time breaks your heart.<br /><br />The film definitely achieves its purpose of making people aware of the issues, and even though the story is gut-wrenching and some portions are extremely violent, I think that it was needed to convey the message clearly. What I did not expect before watching this movie was the outstanding performances I was going to witness. This is definitely DiCaprio's best. He even altered his accent to make it sound like a local and he does this very well. But he also has to play a character with multiple facets and that goes through somewhat of a transformation, and his performance really helps to make this believable. I have never heard of Hounsou before, but was impressed by the emotion he put into his role, and I am sure there will be many starring roles for him in the future. Jennifer Connely is the one I expected the best from, and she did not disappoint, since she delivers a performance on par to the one she gave us on excellent \\"The House of Sand and Fog\\". This is definitely one of the best releases of 2006, and if you can stomach the violence I believe you will agree.omon's.

B000V39KDO|2.0|This movie was nowhere close to something like The Last Samurai. The martial art was not convincing, the fact was horribly far from the truth, the plot was forceful and inapproriate... Ok, tell me how a guy who had just killed several hundred Persians could not hear a horse racing toward him! Duh?<br />The thing that really got people seems to be the over-saturated yellow-cast high contrast color effect of the movie. Trust me, cheap effect! Many, me included, can produce. That's why I compare it to The Last Samurai, its spectacular lighting, and the use of color are unmatched!<br />I knew the movie was based on a fiction, and I'm fine with that. But please dont take it as history. I will laugh my *** off if this movie wins any award... Oh wait, may be (cheap) effect!<br /><br />Btw, for those of you who cant watch the movie, try to turn off your firewall for the movie to load, when it's done you can (should) turn it back on. Hope that help!
0316067598|3.0|I heard the author marcus luttrell on ksfo radio in san francisco and decided to purchase the book.  Being a former member of the airborne rangers I read this book with an open mind as I do most books.  I went through the whole gamut of emotions reading this book, smiles, laughter, a few tears and the memmory of my own friends lost in combat.  The thing that really brought the book down to 3 stars in my opinion was his hatred of liberals, and his love affair with the president.  The president and the liberals stupid rules of engagement are why so many brave men are dying.  It must be a texas thing as for the book if you are a fan of the seals this is probably one of the many must read books on their history.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Rent is a Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winning musical made into a movie.  The story follows the life of a group of Bohemians for one year in New York City from 1989-1990.  Mark Cohen is a filmmaker as well as the narrator who shares an apartment with his friend, Roger Davis, a striving musician whom is HIV-positive.  Tom Collins is Mark and Roger's former roommate, who lost his job at MIT and is HIV-positive.  Tom's lover, HIV-positive Angel, is a drag queen that holds the group together.  Maureen Johnson is Mark's ex-girlfriend turned lesbian, whose girlfriend is lawyer, Joanne Jefferson.  Lastly, Mimi Marquez is Roger's new girlfriend who works at the Cat Scratch Club, is a drug addict, and HIV-positive.   The group of friends have a hard time finding work, and without money they cannot pay their rent.  Throughout the movie, it is slowly understood who does and does not have HIV.      The composer, Jonathan Larson, was born in Mount Vernon, New York and attended Adelphi University on a full scholarship.  After graduation he spent 12 years composing music for plays, and in 1994 he started to compose Rent.  On the night of the last dress rehearsal for Rent, Jon died of Marfan's syndrome, a connective tissue disease.    The movie beautifully displays the strength of the friendships between the characters.  They support each other unconditionally, whether attending life support meetings or helping another in work emergencies.  There is a strong bond between those with HIV and those without, and they freely offer their time when one is sick.  Angel is a strong, independent woman; she simply does not care about others' opinions and is the glue that keeps the group together.  Eventually, the relationships disintegrate, and everyone goes their separate way.  Two months later they all reconnect when one of the former friends encounters a tragic event.  The music is compelling and enhances the storyline.  Each character has his/her own style of sound when they sing, whichis a reflection of his/her personality.  Roger is the rocker, so when he is singing there is a harder drum beat and guitar sound, displaying his stubbornness and determination to succeed in the music industry.  When Mimi sings, it is more passionate and soft with more focus on the piano, reflecting her innocence, and inexperience with life.  The majority of the characters in the movie reprise their roles from the Broadway production.      The only criticism about the movie is after the first viewing it is difficult to have the same emotional reaction to the story.  Secondary viewings allow the audience to pick up on new concepts originally overlooked.    This movie is suitable for those 15 and older due to the selling and use of drugs as well as the HIV storyline.  The character dynamics and friendships in Rent are similar to the types of friendships in Hairspray and High School Musical I and II.

While the story is a little lite on plot, it is much better written than Kite Runner. It is definitely worth the read, as it puts a human face to the daily struggles of women in Afghanistan, while at the same time being a story about humanity rather than war.

B00005JPAO|5.0|Helen Mirren won an Academy Award for her performance as Elizabeth II in \\"The Queen,\\" which depicts the British monarch's reaction to the death of Princess Diana in the summer of 1997. Prime Minister Tony Blair (played brilliantly by Michael Sheen) had just recently been elected at the time of Diana's death, and he was still in the process of determining the best way to forge a successful working relationship with the queen. This film deals with Windsor's fall from grace the week after Diana's death, when the queen refused to follow the prime minister's advice on how to best handle the situation to meet the needs of the grieving British public.<br /><br />At first the queen refuses to take Blair's advice about making any kind of public statement, preferring to remain silent in hopes that the former Princess of Wales would be laid to rest quickly and quietly, without any fanfare. However, the public's frustration grows and Elizabeth faces opposition from the government as well as from her son Charles (Alex Jennings). Soon it becomes clear that the royal family's inaction may wind up being their ultimate demise, and the queen is forced to come to terms with her own emotions and make one of what was surely many difficult choices during her reign.<br /><br />I think this film is brilliant. The cast is absolute perfection, and it's very clear why Mirren received an Oscar for her portrayal as a queen struggling to come to terms with her own personal beliefs and the realization that she doesn't always understand the needs of her people. I also appreciated the way the film handled the treatment of Diana herself. Although the plot of the movie revolves around Diana's death, it's handled gracefully and with dignity. Instead of casting an actress to play the princess, the film relied on a steady peppering of news clips showing the real Diana herself, which was thoughtful and effective.<br /><br />On one hand, \\"The Queen\\" depicts a monarchy that is cold and completely out of touch with modern day society. However, although I didn't always agree with Elizabeth's choices, it was easy to sympathize with her position and understand where she was coming from when she made certain decisions. Regardless of her personal feelings toward the late princess, the queen's belief that quiet dignity should be maintained before caving in to public spectacle is a very good point.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to everyone, if for no other reason than that Mirren portrays Elizabeth II with more humanity than most people might believe is possible. This is truly an excellent film.iety.

078324228X|1.0|A complete fluff piece of propaganda, on a scale with the best productions by Dr. Goebbels, this film was put together by Jewison, Bernstein, Abraham, Rosenberg, Rivkin, Azoff, and others.    The film dishonors the memory of the three law-abiding White citizens pursuing their happiness peacefully in a bar, who were murdered in cold blood by two black males.  This film is an insult to the victims' families.  Any film made on this bloody, savage crime should focus on THEM.    The victims are only named ONCE, in a matter of seconds, in a courtroom scene.  That is their total screen time, and the value of their lives to these filmmakers.  Using the 'Golden Rule':  Is that the film treatment you would want for YOUR murdered brother, sister, father or mother?    The violent murder scene itself, in the bar, is extraordinarily short and sanitary by Hollywood standards.  What happened to the graphic, detailed depictions that are the overwhelming standard in other Hollywood films?  But this gang didn't want an audience reaction to the horrible murders, did they?    So, we are told, both in the film and liner notes, that \\"three Canadian activists\\" take up trying to free Carter, after he'd been found guilty of murder by two lawful juries.  Oddly, we are not told:  WHO is funding the \\"activists\\" and how do they earn their livings, much less pay all these travel and lawyer expenses?  What are their day jobs?  The \\"activists\\" last names are never given in the film.  How odd!  Are they all Semitic, too, like many of the filmmakers involved?  Bob Dylan in a singing cameo, Ellen Berstyn marching in protest ...and Carter's lawyer?  The federal judge that this group appeared before?  If there is some common thread there, the viewer should be made aware of it, honestly and upfront.    This film does not even come close to making a convincing case that Carter was not involved in the murders of three innocent White people.  Having had two White juries does not mean that Carter was not involved in the bar murders.  Even if there was some element of \\"racial prejudice\\" in the trial process -- even if that's taken as a given or proven -- that still does not mean that Carter was not involved in the murders, nor exonerate him from the evil crime.  Instead, this propaganda film asks the viewer to believe that, somehow, the \\"three Canadian activists\\" proved that Carter was INNOCENT (sic), without giving any real evidence to make that argument.    In a particularly sad injustice for the families of the dead White victims, the film ends with a quick screen message that the murders of their loved-ones are now officially called \\"unsolved.\\"    NEGATIVE stars would be be more appropriate for this film, except for what it tells you about the filmmakers.

Only regret is that it does not swivel side to side.  Also if if you like to do studio picture than I recommend getting the SB600 or higher for more function.  Otherwise this is a great flash.

Majority of CD's you buy only 1-2 songs are good - in my opinion all but maybe 2 songs on this cd I like.
0385512104|3.0|Since I am not familiar with the disorder, I do wonder if this is an accurate assessment of the way they think, and if the author could really know this for sure unless he was more than just a youth who worked with autistic children.  Perhaps he studied it and didn't mention that fact.     This book was given to me by a friend whose son, whom I've not met, has Asperger's.     In any event, I was AMAZED at the rudeness in which the English people speak to one another in this book, if it is accurate, using the \\"F\\" word without hesitatation even to a child.  Foul language was used regularly and never commented on as being an issue.  Why?
0618680004|5.0|This book is a wonderful read, filled with legitimate questions about the possibility of God's existence and the reasons of why people believe there is such a god. I'm currently taking an intro to the philosophy of religion course in college, and I find myself using similar arguments against belief in God. I've even lent The God Delusion to one of my friends, who's a deist, after having conversations about religion. A wonderful way for any atheist to strengthen his/her arguments and for any agnostic/deist/theist to reflect and reconsider their beliefs!

B000MCH5P4|2.0|Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's first film \\"Amores Perros\\" that used multi-narrative style and told three intertwined stories abut lives, loves, passions, and losses of people whom we come to know through their relationship with dogs and that were connected by one fateful incident in the streets of Mexico City was a remarkable compassionate movie, a very successful debut that left me waiting for the next I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's film. \\"21 grams\\" (2003) which takes place in the USA, tells the story of three people whose lives become deeply connected through a horrific accident. It is IMO, the best I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's film, with three finest performances from most gripping actors working now, with three stories that take their heroes to such emotional, mental, and physical depths of despair, revenge, and promise of redemption that it is difficult to think of another such powerful film.<br /><br />In his latest and most celebrated film \\"Babel\\" (2006), I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu went global and biblical on us. One city or even one country is not enough for him anymore. Several taglines advertised the film that connects (or disconnects) the characters of different cultures, backgrounds, languages, religions, and nationalities, and their stories. \\"If You Want to be Understood...Listen\\", \\"Tragedy is universal\\", \\"A global disaster\\", \\"A single gunshot heard around the world\\", \\"Pain is universal... But so is hope\\". I agree with all these statements, as for the movie...well, I am afraid it proves that its writer/director may be one trick pony who uses the same approach, the same tools and tricks over and over again. He reminds me of a cook who has learned how to make one dish only, and he keeps serving it to us under the different sauce an on the larger plates. This time, his sauce is not done well. All three stories are primitive, predictable, and poorly written. Some of them simply should not and could not happen. For instance, the story of Amelia, a kind and nice Mexican nanny who had to take two American children in Mexico with her to attend her son's wedding. According the law, if the USA citizens - minors enter Mexico without their parents, they MUST have a notarized letter of permission given by their parents or legal guardian. The nanny would've been stopped and questioned before she crossed the USA-Mexico border which would make the later heartbreaking scenes simply impossible. I wonder if I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu chose to ignore the well known information on purpose to manipulate the viewers. Another question has been brought up often regarding the Mexican story. Why would Amelia let her obviously drunk nephew who had problems crossing Mexico-USA border before drive her and the children back to the USA? Why did Santiago (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal) behave so irrationally? We never found out.<br /><br />Three stories of four, of a nanny and an American couple, her employers, vacationing in Morocco where the wife (Cate Blanchett) was gravely wounded in a shooting accident, and of two Moroccan boys whose father handed them the fateful rifle which is a logical center of the film are connected.  The fourth story though, that of a deaf-mute Japanese teenage girl in Tokyo, \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\", has very little to do with the rest of the stories. Actually, despite a strong performance by Rinko Kikuchi (Chieko), the Japanese part of the movie is weak and I think it does not belong to the movie. It is hard for me to believe that the attractive teenage girl is so desperate to lose her virginity - just to any man who crosses her path, no matter who he is that she would act in a manner immortalized by Sharon Stone in \\"Basic Instinct\\". Judging by her behavior in \\"Babel\\", she does not want to be loved, she does not need a boyfriend who would kiss her, hold hands with her, no, she needs to be f_ucked. NOW! I think that her problems with the lack of communications due to her condition, her anger and frustration toward the \\"normal\\" boys who seem first to be interested in the pretty girls but would stay away after realizing that the girls are deaf-mute, and she silently screams to her friend, \\"They look at us like we're monsters\\", could've been solved by the writers easily had they provided Chieko with a chance to meet a boy of her age with the same disability. If they (the writers) came up with the girls' school for deaf-mute students, I am sure they could've shown similar boys' schools in Tokyo.  But they were not interested in helping their own character. They found it more interesting to put her through the series of absolutely unnecessary sexually explicit and exploitive, humiliating scenes that did not contribute anything compelling or important to the film.<br /><br />In the end, I am afraid that \\"Babel\\" fits closely one of its taglines - \\"A global disaster\\". Even with some good performances, moody cinematography, and impressive Oscar winning musical score, it fells victim to its creator's \\"global\\" ambitions. The Japanese storyline rewritten and reworked could be another movie. As it is now, it brings to my mind a famous Russian saying which translates like \\"An elderberry grows in the kitchen garden and my uncle lives in Kiev\\", meaning , Mr. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, please next time, don't mix apples and oranges.<br /><br />P.S. For the fans of Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu who believe that he has started multi-narrative style. Robert Altman's \\"Nashville\\" was made in 1975 and it was followed by Altman's \\"Short Cuts\\"(1993) and P.T. Anderson's \\"Magnolia\\"(1999).

1582701709|1.0|This book is a beautifully but sparsely printed, almost pocket sized book bulked out with thick paper for an outrageous amount of money and it can be summed up in just one line: you are what you think and believe in.  The author asks you to believe her by blind faith. Which is no different from believing the bible:    \\"As a man thinks in his heart, so he is\\" - Proverbs 23:7;     \\"Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.\\" Mark 11:24     \\"For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, `Be removed and be cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says.  Mark 11:2    \\"And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.\\" Matthew 21:22    In fact, on second thoughts, there is more evidence of the authenticity of the bible than Rhonda's \\"just believe\\" position. At least over the centuries, one hears of miracles and stories of faith, when one reads biographies on people like William Wilberforce or Smith Wigglesworth.     Don't waste your money on this book. For less money, you can buy Zondevan's Student Bible, with boxed information explaining more difficult biblical concepts. And it's a great book of inspiration for wholesome living regardless of your faith!    Just read it as a book of life's philosophies.

B000RJO578|4.0|From the makers of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" comes \\"Hot Fuzz,\\" a takeoff on cop buddy/action movies that is hilarious for about the first hour-and-a-half or so of its two-hour-plus running time, until it falls victim to its own over-the-top excesses.<br /><br />Nicholas Angel is a London police officer with the highest arrest rate on the force.  Does this statistic earn him a round of applause, an increase in pay, or a promotion to a higher rank, as one might expect?  Heavens no.  In fact, Angel is so good at what he does that he has become something of an embarrassment to the far less highly-motivated cops who work with him.  Thus, he is sent to serve and protect the good citizens of Sandford, which is, we are told, the village with the smallest crime rate in all of England.  At first, Angel understandably balks at being such a big crime-fighting fish in such a small, seemingly crime-free pond.  And, indeed, he begins his service to the community by arresting large swaths of the city's population for decidedly minor infractions.  Soon, however, Angel finds himself embroiled in a far more pressing case when prominent citizens suddenly begin showing up dead, the victims of a possible serial killer who may recently have begun operating in the vicinity.<br /><br />In its initial stages, \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is wickedly funny both as a parody of cop movie conventions and as a wry commentary on British rural values.  The typically dry and subtle humor arises from the juxtaposition of the by-the-book stick-to-itness of Angel with the lackadaisical indifference of virtually everyone else with whom he comes in contact.  It would have been very easy for director Edgar Wright and his co-scenarist, Simon Pegg (who also plays Angel) to have reduced the character to the level of a mere caricature or buffoon.  Instead, Angel comes across as a man fully aware of his high-strung obsessiveness (he's lost at least one marriage over it) yet powerless to change it.  Pegg is wonderfully restrained and deadpan as the highly focused, crime fighting Angel, while Nick Frost makes a perfect foil as Angel's inept, but starry-eyed partner who thinks the life of a cop should be more in keeping with what he sees in movies like \\"Point Break\\" and \\"Bad Boys II\\" than what he regularly experiences on the job in Sandford.  There are fine performances, too, from Timothy Dalton, Martin Freeman, Jim Broadbent and Paddy Considine, and many others.  And I defy you to pick out Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan and Peter Jackson in their uncredited cameo appearances.<br /><br />\\"Hot Fuzz\\" might have been a flawless, classic comedy had the filmmakers been able to refrain from over-indulging their very obvious fondness for large-scale action sequences.  Indeed, it is not too long past the midway point that the movie begins to spiral out of control, as Wright and Pegg fall into the trap of mistaking parodies of tedious action scenes for tedious action scenes themselves.<br /><br />Still, I choose to dwell not on the weaknesses of \\"Hot Fuzz,\\" but rather on its strengths, for here is a film that at least knows how to make us laugh for a good deal of the time that we are in its company.  And that's saying quite a lot these days.the highly focused, crime fighting Angel, while Nick Frost makes a perfect foil as Angel's inept, but starry-eyed partner who thinks the life of a cop should be more in keeping with what he sees in movies like \\"Point Break\\" and \\"Bad Boys II\\" than what he regularly experiences on the job in Sandford.

B0000025DD|4.0|Review no. 74. Originally came out in 1978, as this was the long-time Pink Floyd frontman's first of three solo albums. CD's two best tracks, hands down are the FM radio friendly \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\" and the Floyd-ish \\"Raise My Rent\\". A couple of other tunes here I was quite impressed with were the rocking \\"Short And Sweet\\" and {also} Floyd-sound-alike \\"I Can't Breathe Anymore\\". Never did own this record on vinyl, but now I'm more that happy to get the CD reissue. Just look at the asking price. Well worth it. Recommended.
B00005V9HH|3.0|Great suspense but unconvincing twist !      ****Spoiler alert*****  I was bit surprised reading lot of positive reviews after seeing the movie. Well the plot is described in many reviews already. It is story of 5 gang men criminals who agree to blow up a ship where cocaine transaction worth 91 million takes place. The gang men do this disheartedly due to threat of someone called 'Keyser' who knows all their criminal history essentially blackmailing them. After the operation, there are only one survivor (Kevin spacey) who is given immunity after the incident.   The police interrogates him about the blowup to get possible clue of the actual assassin 'Keyser Soze'. Who is this Keyser soze ? Most of the movie is flashback narration of Kevin spacey to help police find out the killer. I won't spoil the the plot further !   The suspense is no doubt thrilling but somehow the story building is unconvincing. I felt more manipulated at when suspense unfolds. Why ? There are so many scenes earlier in the movie which don't make sense at all. Yet due to buildup in the beginning, we try to focus on each scene like investigators only to find that pieces don't fit. It is as if the director played a trick on us and this makes suspense uncompelling.   (Moreover flashback storytelling, I was confused about the sequence of scenes in the movie). We wear investigator cap to analyze the plot and we realize most of it is useless. Also, the details leading to revelation of plot suspense is not convincing. No clues revealed at the end have relavance to the earlier plot. It is as if the director played trick by pulling the rug without any clue.      My comments are probably influenced due to comparision with Sixth sense movie. The movie is probably inspiration to 'twist ending' thrillers like 'Sixth sense' movie. In Sixth sense, the dead man doesn't know he is dead and yet there is scene when suffering boy says 'I see dead people and they don't know they are dead' to the dead man itself. After the suspense, we are compelled to look back the entire plot and it is still convincing. We see many other dead people talking to the boy in many scenes. This makes sixth sense is so bold in storytelling that at the end we don't feel tricked or manipulated (although trick is played on us by Night).   Entire movie seems convincing and we rewind the movie to see again.   This is where 'Usual suspects' fails ! We rather feel manipulated by director. I would prefer to be watch a drama rather than a manipulative thriller.   The movie however has excellent screenplay. The music score by John Ottman is hypnotic and evokes emotion to the plot. Kevin spacey is powerful actor and he does great job as crippled passive criminal !

B0009S4IKQ|5.0|I have a particular affinity for films from the pre-code era, and \\"Grand Hotel\\" is by far my favorite of this genre.  After numerous viewings, I began to understand this wonderful film as a portrayal of the tremendous struggle life must have been for Germans of the Weimar period, even for the entrepreneurial and aristocratic classes, especially in this critical year before power was handed over to Hitler.  In this movie, everyone is broke except the mousy little clerk played by Lionel Barrymore, and every character is trying in his or her own way to achieve or hold on to the dream-world lifestyle they remembered from the days before the Great War.  The hotel decor is very trendy (the bar seats its patrons practically above the heads of standees) and the rooms are large, plush and satiny.    The high point of \\"Grand Hotel\\", for me, is the central love scene between John Barrymore and Greta Garbo, which is probably the most gorgeous ever filmed -- enchanted, poignant and steeped in doom.  The actors were also demonstrably attracted to each other, adding depth and authenticity.     I have to disagree with another reviewer here:  I find John Barrymore's performance quite restrained, even staid at times, and Garbo's very mannered (and -- listen carefully -- she says \\"I ouant to be alone\\", not \\"I vant...\\").  Barrymore did plenty of \\"over the top\\" performances, but this isn't one of them.  Compare \\"Twentieth Century\\", \\"Midnight\\", or his last film, \\"Playmates\\".  (Actually, \\"Playmates\\", an embarrassing stinker made the year before his death, is valuable for an amazing 30-second jewel in its center -- a tearful impromptu rendering of as much of the Hamlet \\"To Be\\" soliloquy as the poor man can remember, in which he seems to grieve the own slings and arrows of his own life and to beg for release.)      Lionel is absolutely priceless, as skillful a comic actor as he is a dramatic one (it is said that comedy is much more difficult).  Young Joan Crawford is breezy and delightful,with no evidence of the harridan she was to become later in her career.  Wallace Beery is, as expected, wonderfully gross and heavy-handed, but the director forgot to tell him to lose the thick accent, since his character is supposed to be a native German speaker like everyone else (except, perhaps, Jean Hersholt's).    People say that this movie is dated.  Of course it is!  So are \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", \\"Casablanca\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz\\".  Every movie, even a classic, carries the style and ambience -- as well as the limited technology -- of the era in which it was made.  A film's date should not be a criticism but an invitation to a treat for latter-day viewers:  time-travel into a universe their own older loved ones may have inhabited.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is the way to do it. All three films in one neat package and the set includes tons of extras too!

The DVD transfers are very good, the movies are great, If you see this set cheap....buy it!

B000E33VWW|3.0|Capote, like many true crime genre films, has the advantages of being able to fallow an already pre-paved formula built around discoveries and pay offs. The other advantage is that more often then not, this type of story revolves around an act that is far outside the path of most of man kinds cautiously lived lives. Most people live there lives in such a way that they try to avoid conflict. I am no exception to this well ingrained way of existing, it is afterall the basis of what we call being civilized. We have all had experiences in our childhood where we have either participated or seen large groups of children, and sometimes even adults, fallow an ambulance to a location to gawk at the atrocity that awaits. If it is something that is particularly bloody, like a rather nasty traffic accident, it tends to bring a larger crowd of spectators. Like kids in a playground running to watch a fight, a true crime film by its very nature already comes equipped with a well baited hook to draw us curiosity seekers in. We are afterall going to see something that we will more then likely never experience in our own tame controlled normality. Films like The Hunt For The Unicorn killer, Boys Don't Cry, Mississippi Burning, Jasper Texas, The Hillside Strangler, Monster, The Accused, and Indictment starring James Woods, are examples of a few films that I can come up with off the top of my head that fallow the priciples of true crime genre story telling. All these films share the same type of pre-existing story design, and all these films work and are very much worth watching. The only real deviation outside of the characters involved, is in who the protagonist is going to be. Is it a film about the perpatrator of the crime? Or is it a film about the cops who solve it? Is it going to be a film about the friends and family members who grieve and fight for justice? Or is it about some other entity involved in the case? It is in this way that a true crime story can find its own originality, and seperate itself from other films in its genre.    Capote is no exception from this true crime formula, and director Bennett Miller does a fine job of keeping the vessel with in the confinds of these well groved tracks. The original aspect to this films story telling design is that of the character of Capote himself. Here we have a flamboyant socialite, decked out in the finest threads money can buy, speaking brilliant English with his dandy limp-wristed accent, and on top of all this, has a rather sizable desire to be the very social center of the entire universe. The juxtaposition of this extremely unusual one of a kind character to the salt of the Earth folks that are found in America's heart land, adds a nice bit of spice to this already intriguing dramatic stew. Furthermore, Capote is a very flawed human being with a poor tendency to drink, he is in short an alcoholic. On top of all this, he falls in love in the most idealistic sense with the main incarcerated murderer. Though this lends itself well in the impassioned writing of his legendary book \\"In Cold Blood\\", it also crosses his motives and passions up into a tangled mess. Capote,dispite his apparent love for the captured killer, is not above lying and manipulating to achieve the ends to his means. Cleary he will stop at nothing to to find the sordid reasons behind the very killings themselves. On the one hand he seems to do all he can to help these two lost souls, including using his fame to find them the best lawyers available. While on the other hand he is not above seeing them executed to achieve the perfect ending to his book. In the end these very twisted desires lead to the downfall of the real Truman Capote himself, as such, In Cold Blood ended up being the last book he would ever write. The film is full of fine performances, including the Oscar winning performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and as mentioned, Bennett Miller does a fine job of not letting the film stagger off track. Yet forall that is done right, there is still one major problem that ultimately hinders the watch-ability of this film.    I loved my red shoes.    My first memory in life was of running on a grassy slope in a park while looking down at my feet. I can still remember how captivated I was with my bright red shoes. It was not until I was older and looked at the photo from this event, that I realized that I was barely two years old when these memories took place. I bring up this early childhood memory to illustrate just where the major problem lies in this film. In an ill fated attempt to manipulate a shift of focus with-in the viewer from the visuals to the importance of the story, Bennett Miller chose to desaturate much of the color out of the movie. In the process he bleached out nearly all of the visual stimulation. To me the notion to do this was a complete utter oxymoron, cinema, by definition, is a visual art form. What confounds me even more about this directorial decision is that Capote is already a very languid film anyway. Outside of the brief instance in which the flashback of the actual crime is shown, there is no activity to be found anywhere in this film. Capote takes place in a flat nearly treeless landscape, dull police buildings with blank walls, and inside dank dingy jail cells. It is a film in which two people sit in an empty cell and talk for long periods of film time. If anything, Capote needed all the visual stimulation it could get its hands on. Now I should point out that one of my all time favorite films just happens to be 12 Angry Men, which is in black and white and takes place in a single room. The difference here is that despite these limitations, 12 Angry Men is visually appealing. The tone and shading to that picture registers as lush, rich, and delicious to the eye. The same can not be said about Capote, which only manages to make my eyelids go heavy like I am going under hypnosis. The admiration I feel for 12 Angry Men should hopefully quellany notion that I lack an attention span and need car chases and explosions to stay interested in a film. No, I believe that more then just the color was desaturated durring the process of removing the highlights out of the film stock. To me, it is as if the very aura of the film was rendered sedate, stagnant, and lifeless.    Capote, an all natural home remedy.    I'll be perfectly honest with you, I own a copy of this film. Yet every time I attempt to watch it, I end up falling asleep. Usually by the time that detective Alvin Dewey (played by Chris Cooper) briefs the media and other concerned citizens about how the police will stop at noting to catch the criminals, I am pretty much counting my first sheep. Maybe its only me and I have rocks in my head or something, but between the desaturation of color and the blankness of this films energy, I can not get past the first half hour of screen time without feeling like I just took a couple of melatonin tablets. The stagnant lack of energy that permeates the very pores of this movie began to put me down with such astounding regularity that I actually decided to keep the film and use it as a sleep aid. I have always been a bit of an insomniac. The funny thing is, is that Bennett Miller chose to desaturate this film in order to enforce a viewers concentration on the story, not to cause them to go under sedation and miss half of the film. I can only conclude by saying that Capote could teach a great lesson to film makers in what not to do, for as my fist memory illustrates, its stimulation that places memories into our minds, not the lack of it.
B000641Z90|5.0|This is a terrific performance by the great Phil Collins and one that in my books ranks as # 1 for several reasons.<br /><br />First of all,the audio and visual quality is superb!.<br /><br />The set list encapsules his greatest hits both old and new and that can't be found in neither \\"serious hits ..live!\\"\\" nor in \\"live and loose in Paris\\".<br /><br />Not only do we get the complete live concert,but also plenty of bonus features such as 224 minutes of extras containing the videos to most of the songs here,documentaries,tv specials,etc that can't be found on any other of his major DVD's.<br /><br />This is truly a wonderful DVD and a major treat for those who like me,love the music of this brilliant singer,<br />musician lyricist and above all : entertainer!!<br /><br />Phil Collins is without a doubt one the greatest performers ever to come out of England and the wonderful  80's era and this DVD more than proves it!!. Just do yourself a favor and buy it!!! you won't regret it...

B000B5XOY8|3.0|Are you at least 25 years old?  Do you remember the big promotional campaign and the anticipation?  I remember going to the theater every week for months before this movie came out just to see the trailer. Sometimes I stayed and watched the feature I paid for.  Sometimes I walked out half way through.  A lot of movies should be thankful to the first \\"serious\\" big screen Batman movie. The Batman trailer boosted box office sales for many otherwise less than appealing movies.  I was telling everyone I knew and complete strangers that BATMAN is going to be the greatest movie ever made.  I even came to terms with them hiring a short guy to play Batman/Bruce Wayne because they hired a short guy to play Joker/Jack Napier. I was so excited to see this I asked my boss for the day off. Then finally came the big day. There I was standing in line outside the theater. I convinced my then wife to come along, first off to show her there's more to movies than cheap teen flicks and secondly to trade off restroom time without losing our place in line. Finally we get in. After butterflies and darkness the movie begins.  A rousing theme song encompasses the theater seats and a bizarre looking city is shown on the giant screen.  A crime is committed and Batman shows up to teach the bad guys a \\"lesson\\". Unfortunately he doesn't show up while the poor family is being mugged.  If he had he may have looked more like a hero. The rest of the movie is filled with alot of interesting scenes that hold your attention but no real plot exists. Eventually Joker tricks Vicky Vale into meeting him at the museum because she thinks it's Bruce Wayne who sent the message.  Batman shows up crashing through the glass ceiling. (an impressive entrance) Now I'm reminded of SPACEBALLS with Dark Helmut playing with his dolls. In a nasally voice saying \\"I'm here to save my girlfriend, Hi honey!\\" Batman's best line. \\"You weigh a little more than a hundred and eight\\" Joker's best line. \\"Bob? Gun. Without even looking at him (POW) shoots Bob. Anyway because of all the hype and my big mouth, I had to save as much face as I could by focusing on all the positive aspects I could.  But when people kept bringing up how Batman missed Joker with a barrage of ammunition and  Joker knocked the Batwing out of the sky with one bullet (Joker didn't have a \\"The\\" in front of his name for this movie.) I used to say it wasn't really Joker but a projected image and the bullet was really a small missile. That's why the gun barrel was so long. I stopped covering up and came to grips with that this was not the greatest movie ever made. Nor was it the worst. It was just a movie that fell far below expectations because of too too much hype. I remember the hype...  Don't let my review throw you off. I do recommend this 2 disc set to own. It is still a fun movie to watch, despite it's shortcomings and the bonus features are plentiful. Or you can get the 8 disc Anthology. That's the one I got. The choice is yours. I love all things BATMAN, even when I hate it.ng at him (POW) shoots Bob.

Once you have recorded the reverse message, simply use a tiny dab of super glue to put the shell back together AFTER you reversed the tape to its original position.
0060920084|3.0|Originally published on SensiblySassy.blogspot.com   Lost Continent:  Well a couple years ago I read Bill Bryson's book Neither Here nor There and it was a hilarious guide through Europe. So when I saw Lost Continent on the shelves I instantly wanted to read about Bill's road trip through the U.S. Within the first five pages I was chuckling to myself and out loud. (Luckily Jon was the only one sitting next to me on the plane as I read) By the time the hour and a half flight touched back down on the ground I had polished off quite a few pages.    As the book went on I began to feel less enamored with the book than I initially had. The tone shifted from funny to cranky as the trip/book wore on. Now I wonder if it is the fact that the trip began to take its toll on Bryson or if he felt that crotchety was a good tone for him to switch to-we may never know. Overall if you were to sample some of Bryson's work I would absolutley recommend Neither Here nor There over Lost Continent . Neither Here nor There gives you a hilarious and personal guide through Europe whereas Lost Continent really helps you remember what it was like to take loooong car rides with your parents-the good and the bad.
B000N6TYLW|3.0|I have been a devout fan of the Gilmore Girls since it's first episode.  The witty banter and pop-culture reference made this show unique among a mish-mash of teen dramas.  GG is different in a way that draws you in, makes you feel like you're a friend of the town.  Over the past 7 years Lorelai and Rory have taken us into their world, we watched them grow, and make comedy from disadvantage, and share so a wonderful bond, the pair truly had a great chemistry in which the writers had mixed in the mother daughter dialogue but crossed over to the best friend dialogue, the pair really transcends the normal conversational contexts that lie between most mother-daughter-duos.  However, I am saddened that since around season 5 the writing declined and the characters seemed to have lost that magic chemistry so dominant in the first 4 seasons.  And while season 7 was one of the busiest most dramatic seasons... the writing had slipped so far down the tube, that the show didn't feel like the same show.  It was comparable to walking into a room when a really close couple had just had a spat... there was such a pretentious air to the dialogue and to the chemistry.  It all seemed very forced and unnatural, which was a HUGE CONTRADICTION to the other seasons.  I will always love the show, the characters, it's where I go when I want to get away from the world and I have watched the seasons so many times, I can spout the lines verbatim, but I had to say 7 was truly a disappointment for me... especially the last episode...  the dynamic of the show was completely taken away by how they left it hanging.
B00007KWHG|4.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed \\"Jersey Boys,\\"and reliving the unfolding of the Four Seasons from Year One, I just had to hear again the original recordings of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. This CD did not disappoint. Frankie's unique falsetto voice backed up by the boys from Jersey was never better heard. The anthology is not complete but it is more than sufficient to emmerse you into a state of being there, pop hit after pop hit, and the enjoyment only increases as the sequence reveals richer and richer tracks. Listening to the Very Best of Franki Valli and the Four Seasons really spices up my day every time I play it.
B00004ZB9D|3.0|Now I don't claim to be a Rock expert, or a devoted fan of Mr. Kravitz. I have followed his career for a number of years, and every now and then a song of his will catch my attention. This CD is the perfect one for me, as I won't be getting all his CDs, and this covers the best of them( saying that I would like his very Curtis sounding' What goes around come around' from his [[ASIN:B000000WHP Mama Said]]. This leads me to my second point. In his earlier CDs as he struggled to find the right line between sounding like your idols, and finding his own voice, he often came across as an immature artist. I believe that after four or five Cds he is finally starting to find his own voice. My favorite songs on this Cd are' Are you Gonna go my way?'' Fly away', 'It ain't over 'till it's over', 'Always on the Run', and the excellent 'Let Love Rule'.
6305428352|5.0|This totally believable student/teacher drama grabs the viewer's attention from the beginning. Set in the turbulence of the 1960's it sweeps you through 30 years of this man's life (the real-life events that are woven through it are well done). It is the story of a man with good intentions, a teacher who is still learning himself. Glenn Holland (played by Richard Dreyfuss) is an aspiring composer who turns to teaching music at a local high school as a way to help make ends meet and still have time for his composing. His dream in life is to compose an opus that would one day make him famous. His wife (played by Glenne Headley) is loving, devoted and supportive wife. Things begin to change when she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their deaf child. Initially, Glenn has a great difficulty dealing with the fact that his son is deaf and gradually we see him pulling away from his family. For him, it is incomprehensible to have a child who is unable share his love of music. As we all do, Glenn has his faults, but he has a very big heart which keeps you tuned in to caring about him.     This movie is about real people in realistic situations. We see a struggling teacher, the wife who supports the struggling teacher through everything, a caring well intentioned principal, a very strict, rigid vice principal, and the students who can all be found in any high school anywhere in the U.S.. The one thing that makes this movie magical is the simplicity of it.    He's not a bad man, on the contrary, he's just a man. This is an inspirational movie that will stay with you long after you see it for the first time. It is the story of how you can discover new dreams as you pursue the old ones. Tried, true and timeless it is probably Richard Dreyfuss' greatest role yet. There are nothing but remarkable performances by this cast which includes Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, Jay Thomas, Alicia Witt just to name a few.     One thing that cannot be omitted from a review of this spectacularly moving film is the fantastic soundtrack. This PG movie should be required viewing for all music students (who knows, they might learn alot from it).
009917961X|3.0|Like most Grisham books, this is a simple book that requires no thought or effort to get into. No wonder he is so popular.    There are no plot twists. Pretty much everything falls Rudys way. Not once is he tripped up in court. The case is so cut and dried that someone who doesn't know what he is doing can win it with no effort. This is problem one with the book. Where is the drama?    The second problem is that both Rudy and the Blacks repeatedly claim that they are not suing for the money, but for the principle, and Rudy wants to put them out of business. So after he does this, but gets no money, both Dot and Rudy are upset.    Just as bad is Kelly, the typical beaten wife who deserves no sympathy because she seems to want to get beat. No one intelligent would get involved with this train wreck, no matter how hot she may be. The ridiculous part of this story line is how Rudy takes her back to get clothes. No lawyer would allow her to go to his house without police escort, this is nonsense! Then of course, he lets her gets arrested, and apparently the police are too incompetent to investigate it properly, so she walk in like two days.    The worst is that at the end Rudy decides to never practice law again. This pretty much comes out of nowhere and is based on the fact he lost out of 33% of $50 million, even though it was never about the money. Huh?    Despite all these major problems, I still liked the story. I am still not sure why, but I can't give this book the 1 or 2 stars it deserves. I can't believe people give this McBook 5 stars. He is the fast food of fiction. Grisham has always been a decent storyteller, too bad he has absolutely no concept of drama and plot twists.
0920668372|5.0|I have to say that Robert Munsch is one of my favourite authors when it comes to children's books. This is the story of a mother who loves her son unconditionally through all the stages of life. The illustrations are beautiful and really help bring the story to life. This story always gets me all misty eyed near the end when the son is a grown man and the roles are reversed and he is now taking care of the mother. It's a lovely story for us to show children that no matter what there is always someone who loves them and they are never alone.

1852691263|5.0|The very hungry caterpillar is an excellent story for young children as it teaches them to read through repetition. It's a very simple story. The pictures are bright. I read this book with my preschool children quite often. They now read along with me and just have to point at all the foods as we say the names and count them. Thanks to this book they now also know that caterpillars spin a cocoon also known as a chrysalis, and when the caterpillar sleeps in his cocoon he will come out a beautiful butterfly. They learned all this through reading a simple children's story several times. I know repetition can be hard for parents but it really is a key to young children's learning. That's why I love Eric Carle stories he uses repetition in a fun way.

B00003OSSL|5.0|Politics and sex life do not work together very well in the USA as soon it gets off the very straight direct family-oriented lackluster public image politicians are supposed to respect down to the very last dot on the line. A supercop in Washington DC and a female representative in Congress from the state of New Hampshire get together due to the accident that drowns their spouses in a plane crash. This adultery on the side of the husband of the representative will ruin her life and career and the purely accidental and transient relation between the two survivors will become the only question that will seem important for the press. Something is wrong in this country and it has to be healed fast. The film shows the situation, its contradictions and the passion that will in fact be nothing but solace in a stressful moment with tact and great acting, with delicacy and an apology for the narrow-mindedness of the press and political system of a country which is supposed to be a democracy and does not guarantee the privacy of the private life of its politicians. That kind of wild hunting from some journalists is criminal and ten years ago it cost the life of Princess Diana under a bridge in Paris. That kind of trashy journalism should be outlawed and severely punished by our courts. The film seems clear about it: freedom still has a lot of battles to fight and win in our countries. The end of history is far from being close at hand.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
0385513755|3.0|I would definitely recommend if you're going to read this book that you read the illustrated edition, as I found it was a great help in understanding the points of discussion in the book, myself having limited knowledge on the topics of historical architecture or Leonardo Da Vinci.<br />The book was interesting enough, there where however a few slow parts that I found difficult to get through. Which leads me to question all the attention the book received in the first place? The book is clearly fiction so to all those who seemed to be offended by it I can only say \\"Don't believe everything you read\\".

B000QXDEDG|1.0|The battle of Thermopylae was very thoroughly documented by Roman historians, but this special effects bombshell hardly resembles the actual facts of that most important land battle in history. Couching dialog in hip modern terms that a younger audience can quickly understand and relate to is not HISTORY, it is HISTORY-LIKE.  The armor is an invention of Hollywood prop suppliers and not authentic. The depiction of battles deteriorates into bedlam and street fighting techniques.  Various characters were given dialog and action not consistent with historical facts.  I watched it once and relegated it to the dumpster, where it belongs with all of the other modern Hollywood political propaganda.
B000026C3T|5.0|After carefully picking my way through all of the Zeppelin collections and  albums out there, I settled on this one. Why? Because it has the best song list of all with no junk fillers. This is your best value in terms of price and delivery of the heaviest of Led Zeppelin's   hits.
B0001I562I|3.0|In this 1986 Disney flick, Veronica Cartwright (the whiny lady from 'Alien') played mother to a child kidnapped by a robotic space ship.  Despite her best efforts, the plot sinks to an irritating low when the robot alien ship scans the child's mind and suddenly becomes Pee-wee Herman.  Is any more commentary required?  This is bad 1980's family movie-fluff, like Short Circuit, but more obnoxious.  Watch it for sentimental value or for an ironic laugh at Disney's half-hearted critique of the xenophobia inherent in American foreign policy.  Otherwise, entertain your kids with something more entertaining, like Veronica Cartwright's brilliant 1979 film 'Alien.'

B0007PALZ2|5.0|This is one of Gilliam's best films, and one of his most commercially successful.  It's one of the few films I really liked in the 1990's, as it is (as with most of Gilliam's work) a true work of art and something that is totally Gilliamish.  It is a sad, haunting, strange work.  One of the reasons this film works so well is that the studio left Gilliam alone and let him get on with it.  The performances by Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, and Brad Pitt are all excellent.  Willis is exceptionally good, showing that he can actually act if working with a great director like Gilliam.  Stowe brings a tender, quiet quality to her role, and Pitt is great as a borderline insane guy.  Some of his dialogue is a bit obvious, but overall it doesn't detract too much from the film.  This is a pseudo-remake of Chris Marker's remarkable La Jetee, but Gilliams does it justice.  La Jetee is a masterpiece, but then, so is this film.  Gilliam really does \\"reimagine\\" it, bringing his own distinct voice to the material, and expounding on Marker's masterpiece.  Marker recently said he felt this film was wonderful because Gilliam has such a rich imagination (which he does).  The ending is quite sad, but it works very well, and kudos to the studio and Gilliam for keeping it in.  I always admired Gilliam's film, even his misunderstood Tideland.  I think he's one of the great directors.  This is one of his best films....

B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I don't understand all the bashing going on about these guys. As long as there is music people will continue to compare bands to others. I've listened to this album numerous times. Yes, there is a lot of 70's influence and riffs. But using words like \\"steal\\" or \\"ripped-off\\" when talking about the riffs is a little harsh. Is that such a bad thing? I'm tired of hearing about how this album has \\"ruined\\" 70's rock by \\"ripping-off\\" riffs. I happen to love 70's rock. And do I think that these guys do it any injustice? Absolutely not. If anything they pay tribute to an amazing era of music. People that think that this is somehow a \\"sin\\" against 70's music need to lighten up.    Wolfmother has been compared to every band under the sun it seems. There is a lot of influence from Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and even Rush...to name a few. But you would be hard-pressed to find a band that isn't influenced by bands that came before them. Think about it. Name any band and I could think of at least one other band that there are obvious influences from...and so can most people that are music fans...not just rock fans or so on.    Comparing Wolfmother to The White Stripes is odd to me. Not that that's a bad thing, I'm a huge Stripes fan. I guess I fail to see it. I can pick out a lot Jack's riffs that I think I've heard before. But then I get a life and move on and enjoy the music. Which is exactly how I see Wolfmother.    Bottom line is: If you want a good (although not worth 5 stars) pure rock and roll album...then buy this cd now. If you go into it without an open mind and look for all the influence, you won't enjoy it as much. But If you're like me and find influences like that (Jet anyone?) actually refreshing from the normal talentless-look-at-me-I-can-sing/rap-but-nothing-else-crap that seems to be going around...then go for it.    Oh, and to the reviewer comparing Wolfmother to Dio...c'mon...get real. Apples and oranges my friend. Obviously a Dio fanboy. I hate how people basha band in a review and then ramble on about another band because \\"I've seen them live\\" or \\"they're better\\". Never saying why it's a bad album.

I work in Maya as a CG artist and instead of drivers this thing uses mel  scripting to function and will choke your system full of callback info and become useless and unuseable after about 2 minutes of use.

Someday when they write a good driver perhaps I will be back in business, BUT for now it is a paperweight at my workstation.

B000R7HY0K|2.0|I just don't know what to say?  I'm a HUGE QT fan and this movie was just plain bad! How could the same writer/director of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and Kill Bill be responsible for this mess?  The dialouge was never ending and it was not unique, quirky, funny, or intriguing like it was in his previous works...it was just ANNOYING.  Also I don't think it would have been possible for QT to write more unlikeable female characters in the second half of this film. I was rooting for them all to die!  And sadly, they were SUPPOSSED to be the heroes. Also, what happened to Stuntman Mike at the end of the film?  He just wussed out.  Very weak all around.    Although I will acknowledge that I enjoyed much of the first half of the film and the car chase scene.  Hence 2 stars instead of 1.

B00008RH3L|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies, not least because of the haunting score that plays during the opening credits and recurs throughout.  I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this.    The movie was filmed in New Orleans--I was there during its filming, and streets were constantly being blocked off--but I'd say it's intended to be New York or Boston.  Note the Irish tenor of the gangs and the police chief.    I don't know what the symbolism of the hats is.  Does anyone?
B0009MWAVQ|5.0|I can't imagine anyone regretting purchase of this set.  Not only is it a remarkable bargain, it is technically and musically of the highest caliber.<br /><br />I have been collecting Scarlatti recordings for 30 years.  It's hard to think of another composer whose works allow for so much variation in interpretation.  A Scarlatti sonata that seems hum-drum when played by performer X can be absolutely hair-raisingly electrifying when played by performer Y.  Five or even ten different performances of some of these 555 would not be too much.<br /><br />Scott Ross's traversal of all 555 sonatas-- played on several different harpsichords, all excellent instruments (with just a few sonatas played in ensemble or on an organ, in accordance with the composer's apparent intentions) -- is the most exciting addition I have ever made to my collection.  It should be the core of any collection of Scarlatti recordings.  It is now certainly the core of mine.<br /><br />Besides the obvious advantage of completeness, the greater miracle of these discs is that Ross's interpretations are consistently fine.  Never show-offy (some people play some of these so fast you can't believe it -- but also so fast you miss a lot of the fine detail  that makes Scarlatti so rewarding), Ross is also never plodding.  Some of these pieces benefit enormously from being played a bit slower than virtuosi tend to take them.  However, in Scarlatti speed and precision count -- and Ross has all you could ask for.<br /><br />I have fine piano versions in my collection that bring me great pleasure, but on the whole I prefer my Scarlatti via the thinner but cleaner sonorities of the harpsichord, especially in the bass register.  Thank heaven that Ross took such care to choose instruments that allowed him to exhibit the full delights of harpsichord timbre!<br /><br />Finally, the producers should be thanked for including 150 pages (!) of commentary in English (though you will need your best eyeglasses to read these notes, which are printed in tiny -- but fortunately crisp -- letters). Besides providing a general guide to various blocks of sonatas, composed in various periods in the composer's life, the booklet includes a cogent sentence or two about absolutely every piece!<br /><br />The interview and biographical material on Scott Ross, a fine artist who died much too young (and of whom I had not previously heard), is also surprisingly gripping.<br /><br />What an accomplishment this was!  Ross died not long after completing these performances, apparently aware  that he had done a fine thing.  This magical and delightful set is a fitting monument to a considerable interpretive talent.  If only Ross were still with us and we could see him play these live!-- but fortunately crisp -- letters). Besides providing a general guide to various blocks of sonatas, composed in various periods in the composer's life, the booklet includes a cogent sentence or two about absolutely every piece!

0736063684|5.0|This book is a wealth of knowledge.  I originally heard about this book from my sister-in-law who's in med-school.  She bought this book for an anatomy class, so it's very detailed in that regard.  Every major and minor muscle is clearly labled and colored so the reader can easily distinguish which muscles are being worked in each exercise.  There are many different exercises for each muscle group, so variety in a workout is easy.

068485743X|5.0|A good writer will spend a year writing a book and two years editing it.  Knowing that, I wonder why we are so quick to dismiss spending a pittance on a book that will show us 90% of our errors in two easy days of reading.  You can read an entire shelf of grammar books and not read one of the critical hints in this book.  Our English teachers are milking us.    Great writers need this book.  Average writers need this book.  Buying it will save you a lot of time and money, regardless of how well you write.  The book is actually titled incorrectly.  It's about the whole book, using the first five pages as an example, exactly as the publisher will do while deciding to buy it or send it home.    What struck me right off was how it might improve a writer's group.  Imagine everybody in the group actually taking about the things that matter.    Sure, you might know some of what is in it, and you might not be ready for some of what you read, but a good editor costs you five cent a word and they're usually useless in the macro-world of style and form.  Do the math.    I have actually advised a few friends to buy the book, and I'll get right to the criticism I got back from a couple.  There are a lot of writers who think that the world is trying to box them in and taking away their artistry by setting up a bunch of rules that will crucify their talent.  That's a big load of rubbish.  If you think that way, don't buy this book (although this book does no such thing).  After all, there is plenty of competition among the adults in the writing world, and those of us who are serious need the manuscripts on the publisher's desk that are tossed into the round file after perusing the first paragraph.  How else will they identify those worth keeping?
0684830515|5.0|The Sun Also Rises turned out to be quite a remarkable read and a novel worthy of classic status.  It is absolutely amazing how much symbolism and hidden meaning Hemingway can sneak in through his distinctive clear and simple prose style.  On the other hand, if you are not paying attention and miss the implied messages then this novel will strike you as nothing particularly special.    The book is about a group of American and English expatriates residing in Paris during the 1920s. They live aimless, purposeless lives after World War I because their whole value system has been shaken up.  They are members of the \\"Lost Generation\\", a term popularized by this very book.  Although the plot is simplistic, with Jake Barnes and his friends traveling to Spain for the Pamplona fiesta, the brilliance of the novel shines through in the relationships and dialogue between characters.  The rambunctious Lady Brett Ashley is the target of four men's desires and Hemingway uses her to exemplify the destructiveness of sex and the male insecurity felt after World War I.  It is a world where everyone drowns their sorrows in alcohol.  The novel ends in an outstanding description of a bull-fight and on a hopeful, wishing note.    The novel opened my eyes to how drastic the effects of WWI were on soldiers and how disenchanted some of them became with prewar values and notions.  I also was truly impressed by Hemingway's bullfighting descriptions and how he made them seem almost like poetic events.  The characters were likable and compelling, too, and gave the novel much life even without an enchanting plot. Although I couldn't relate to the characters all that well, I'm sure someone who has had more of life's experiences will have no trouble doing so. Altogether, Hemingway created a novel that changed the literary world forever and will leave a lasting impression in many minds for generations to come - it sure did in mine.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|I rarely watch thrillers but I enjoyed this one a lot. The plot was pretty clever. Actually I should say I enjoyed the first two hours of it, because they slapped on a lousy ending. If you were watching with a few friends and stopped the movie before the last 20 minutes everyone in the room could come up with a better ending than the one they used.    Leonardo DiCaprio was great, but when I see Jack Nicholson clowning around in roles like this it just makes me think of Foster Brooks.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|Remember when you were little (for me not too long ago,) the earth seemed too big to believe and too beautiful to imagine.

The beauty that is presented here in such pristine High Definition is something that I have never seen before, and once you start, something you dont want to end. They were able to make this so profound that when the narrators voice says at one point, \\"this is the first time this has ever been recorded\\" you cant help but get chills.<br />  One of my favorite things about this series is that its not afraid to show you sad things as well but present them in a meaningful way (dont tell me the sight of the mortally wounded polar bear didnt bring a tear to your eye.) This series is a marvel to see and hear and I hope that everyone on Planet Earth gets to see what we have and what we can lose...
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Nikki and the Crue since back in the day.  I have to say this album is an incredible experience.  The music and the lyrics bind so tightly, they pull you in to Nikki's life (and death) in 1986-87.  When you listen to the album you almost feel dirty and by the end, you are resurrected as Nikki was.  I recommend this album without any hesitation.
630587493X|3.0|I found this to be a very good science fiction film, well made for the most part. I was intrigued to see it when it was first advertised and am surprised more was not done to advertise it better.<br /><br />I gave it three stars simply because of the way the movie is formatted in its plot delivery. While Andrew, played by actor Robin Williams, starts as a robot who, being the exception to the rule, \\"becomes aware\\" from the day he is \\"switched on\\" and eventually reinvents himself into a human from his robot body; there were many gaps in the time passages of this film that left me with a feeling of \\"emptiness\\", a desire of wanting more of the story told about Andrew. Even when he is dismissed from his owners home, after gaining his freedom as a robot and builds his home by the sea shore with 20 years passing; you get a number of these large gaps of time passing with little said about Andrews development and growth as a robot slowly rebuilding himself and developing into a human.<br /><br />I think the permise is intriguing to begin with, but in need of greater development. I do not see this as a children's science fiction film meant for laughs, but something that operates as serious science fiction to begin with. You certainly can take your kids to this film.<br /><br />I think the personality of Andrew really teaches all of us what it is to be really \\"humane\\" in our dealing with others and that is a message I liked about the film. it was interesting to see a more toned down, serious side to Robin Williams; given how talented he is.<br /><br />It is a great film to watch, but I would have liked to see more even if it took another 45 minutes of added footage to fill in the gaps more during the time passages in the film as Andrew ages and how his friends die over time as he ages to be 200 years old. Still a very lovely film to view if you want a quiet thoughtful evening to send you off to bed.
B000M4RG42|3.0|I was looking for something more like \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" which was an excellent movie. Although FOF is typical Eastwood quality, I found the movie itself boring and still haven't finished it. I guess if you're into WWII history and character studies it would be better, and although the story about the two flags is interesting the movie just didn't do much for me.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Best investment anyone can make.  Spectacular scenes of natural beauty with beautiful background music and comforting narration by David Attenborough.  Besides the beauty of some ofthe scenes, there are also some shots which you wonder \\"how they managed to catch that on film\\".  This is not a boring documentary.  Some scenes are downright scary--like shots of Great White Sharks attacking seals.      The high definition transfer is fantastic.    Simply incredible.  A must for anyone's Blu-Ray collection.
B000002LAC|3.0|This CD was a bit of a disappointment to me although the three singers are excellent.  I didn't particularly care for most of the music.  I had heard somewhere along the way that this CD - \\"Trio\\" was supposed to be outstanding.  I really didn't think so
B00006LLLN|4.0|This is so funny,  I've downloaded a bunch of the cuts on this CD from the internet over the last couple of years and always though they were bootlegged because of the audience \\"participation\\".

I love the entire CD from beginning to end and would have given it a five but for the bad decision to include all the extraneous sound.
B000G8NXZK|5.0|I had heard about \\"Brazil\\" and was familiar with Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame.  I figured that there were a lot of possibilities with this movie but I never expected what I watched last night.  I am still trying to sort it out but I know enough to know that I watched a great movie.<br /><br />Frankly, I had toyed with getting this movie several years ago but I held off due to the steep prices I kept finding.  I bought a used copy at a more reasonable price and found that I got the three CD set.  I generally just watch the movie with little or no regard for the extras.  \\"Brazil\\" is unique enough that I may make an exception with this set.<br /><br />My first impression is that \\"Brazil\\" is a film that looks like what the movie version of \\"1984\\" might have looked like if it were made with the film technology of its' title (1984) but with all other technology limited to the year it was copyrighted (1949).  I hope that makes sense because I was bewildered by the amazing sets and, to a lesser extent, the special effects.  Yet I kept seeing the technology of my parent's era (and I'm 55).  As the movie went on I began to enjoy this retro-science fiction movie that shows the real and imagined dangers of the world Orwell tried to warn us about.  The over-welming bureaucracy, the signs of Big Brother everywhere, the paranoia of the opressed as well as the opressors, etc...  The story swims around in a variety of directions in a world where to think, say or do anything out of the ordinary becomes dangerous.  However, it may not be quite so bad given what passes for \\"ordinary\\" in this world.<br /><br />I admit to sensing a time or two that \\"Brazil\\" may be too long.  If so, I will likely prefer the Producer's cut rather than the 142 minute Director's cut I watched last night.  I had started by stating that I had heard of \\"Brazil\\" before.  After watching it, I can't believe that I haven't heard MORE about it.
B00005JPUL|3.0|THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF REVIEW FOR ME!!!    Had I seen THE INVASION at another time in life, I might have been willing to poo-poo it and move on; but having just returned from a vacation that took me into areas of the country where \\"same mindset thinking' is so predominate where people act and think identically, I viewed THE INVASION through a much different lens. I was actually in areas where people think so much alike and are so outwardly \\"charming\\" and \\"hospitable\\" that they are willing to blow everyone else to Hell (and NOT back!) in order to have everyone thinking, acting and being like they are. I thought this was a great contrast to what THE INVASION postulates that world peace was possible through control of the individual.    I didnot find this THE INVASION to be a great film at all.I thought that the likes of Northam,Craig and Kidman were so much more worthy of better material, but hey, they need to work! Having seen all of the other versions of this story,to me, this was just an alternative presentation of the \\"same ol'-same-ol'\\" with a different style.Nothing wrong with that. (It was filmed in my hometown for over two years and snarled downtown traffic everyday.) But, that said,when I can walk away from a \\"zombie film\\" (I cannot think of a better term),with something that sticks in my crawl, then I am pleased that my time was well spent.Something that I have learned the hard way I will continue to take with me through life: I will NOT let anything or anyone control the way I think. LONG LIVE THE INDIVIDUAL!
B000M4RG42|4.0|flags of our fathers was a nicely done film. at some points it made me feel as if i was there. seeing what they saw, living what the lived, all the blood, corpses, and not knowing if they would live or die. everything they would go through, friends they would lose, and family they never know if they would see again. they would return, not feeling like heroes, but feeling empty, alone, with no one to understand, only those who lived and died during war. they would be traumatized, with images and voices they would never forget, but never share. this movie was very well done, a good thumbs up for catching that accuracy of the feeling only those who've been to war know about. clint eastwood nice job. great actor, and director. through this you can see just what people of all backgrounds, and race have done to give all of us what we now have.
B000OY8NII|5.0|Eureka has everything going for it: fun story lines that are either inventive or clever re-tellings of familiar ones, smart dialogue that never takes itself too seriously for too long and does not fall into the trap of being too self-aware ; and actors who find just the right spot for their characters, pretty much from the get-go.     As a sci-fi show about a City of über-nerds decades in advance on the rest of the planet, it is interesting enough, cleverly avoiding an uneasy comparison with very real science towns of the past, typically in the old Soviet Union. The characters of Eureka are so individualistic, quirky and likable that one is not too concerned about the questionable nature of this elitist environment which seems to have (limited) accountability only to the DoD. It even gets real-life dilemmas very real, as when Henry and Nathan argue over the goals of basic research and the Big Money or Big Guns compromises that make them possible. You don't see this articulated too often on television, and never as simply or as smartly as on Eureka.    The success of the show, though, is in its greatest part the success of its actors. Observe for instance the work done by Colin Ferguson, who probably channels the comedic timing of his early years with Second City into a Sheriff Carter who is the perfect Straight Man, serious throughout but regularly triggering good old fun along the way.    Observe also the work done by Ed Quinn (Nathan Stark) who grows gradually from an annoying suit (what new Sheriff Carter sees initially) to a more layered, interesting character as the season progresses. In Season Two, because of a modification of his situation, Stark will become even more complex, but Season One already shows the transformation in motion, explaining why Allison Blake, though separated/divorced from her husband, is still very close to him, much to Carter's chagrin. Of course, we see Stark evolving because Carter himself is forced to gradually see him in a more complex way. This is typically what you can expect from Eureka and what gives an otherwise expectable sci-fi fare its unusual zest.    The show knows how to be touching, as in the connection Carter has with his daughter. It is hilarious when Carter, even though he solves a lot of their problems, is gently treated as a lovable half-wit by the other residents of Eureka, or when Carter harasses Fargo, typically about his secret Buffy the Vampire Slayer infatuation. It is poignant when Henry has to face impossible choices and their consequences which will carry over into season two.    For a show that started as a project for an animated series, Eureka is remarkably human, without even giving the impression of trying too hard. With its good (and probably unexpected)good ratings, it will hopefully continue to evolve for many seasons. And with its underlying arcs (the Artifact, Beverly's role, Allison's son...) it has a built-in path to do just that.
B000286RKW|5.0|man, goodfellas is one of the best, and stays real on the mafias way of life. no beating around the bush, gives it to you strait. the whole story, the drugs, the profanity, the beatings, the betrayel. beautifully done. scorsese out did himself on this one. he's a great director and this was just a masterpiece. brilliant putting robert de niro, ray liotta, and joe pesci together. they were terrific. they just bring that mafia vibe, to the table. robet de niro is the man in just about every movie he does. it shows you the all the good: money, sex, drugs, and the power, along with all the bad: betrayel, crime, addiction, and death. you can't trust nobody, and you can't let this stuff get to your head. if you can't stay true your finished. it feels so good when you're on top, but when you fall there's no turning back, you get what's coming to you. great movie, perfect as it is, and wonderful potrayel of this underworld.

1400063515|3.0|Taleb is insufferable.  His writing meanders around in a sort of self-absorbed epiphany, from his life story, about which he appears to have almost no self-awareness, by way of his intolerant ravings at various Nobel laureates for their blindness to their own fallibilities, a trait he shares in spades, to at last some extremely thought provoking notions on the uncertainty of things.  If you can wade through all the former, you may well be rewarded by the latter.  But it is a tough slog.  His earlier \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" was a much better book.  His ideas were less developed but at least he seems to have had an editor who insisted he write for the reader.

The illustraions alone would have sold me, i love the little quick sketches and diagrams, plus the old-time travel log look is really appealing. All of the \\"little-known-facts\\", author's musings/notes, and narratives make this a rare find for any fantasy lover.

I just saw The Prestige now, having borrowed it from the public library.  I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.    The cast is first rate.  Any film that features Michael Caine and David Bowie is probably worth seeing.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were both very good.  The performances kept me watching.    The inclusion of Nichola Tesla and his battle with Thomas Edison was interesting and one could say that their rivalry mirrored that of the two magicians here.  What bothered me most was the ending.  It was a cheap trick and it spoiled the whole movie for me.  What a contrast with the inspired ending of The Illusionist.    In a nutshell, The Prestige is about hate; The Illusionist is about love!
B000NVIXFK|1.0|You meen these guys are still around??  They've all got to be like 40 now.  The music sounds tired and dated, just like the members themselfes!!  The singer has the same nasally voise, the drumber knows no good beats, and the guityar player just sits there and hacks out a few useless sords.  Its anyones guess just what these lyrics are suposed to be about!!  Nothing I can relate to.  Listen people, et some Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, Death Can For Cutie, Korn, Linkin Park, Taking Back Sunday, Limp Bizkit, Kidd Rock, Drowning Pool and Staind for actual good musik!!  Go Bengals, who dey!@!
B0001UL7RY|2.0|Avril Lavigne's first album, LET GO, went quadruple platinum and was nominated for five Grammy Awards for 2002. Unfortunately, Norah Jones was also nominated for five--competing with Avril in several--and Norah swept her nominations, while Avril was left with none. I remember Norah was interviewed backstage and she admitted to strolling past Avril with an armful of grammies and saying something to rub salt in the wound, adding insult to injury, as it were.<br /><br />Avril had something going there at first with her neck ties over T-shirt look on MTV, and her anti-Britney stance. But then she had to mispronounce David Bowie's name while announcing the Grammy nominations. The Lavigne backlash had begun. Next thing you know, a computer virus was named for her that forced you to go to her website. Why did things have to get so complicated?<br /><br />Her sophomore effort, UNDER MY SKIN, was edgier, darker, and dare I say just a little more mature? Two whole years had gone by. As I write this, there are 1,122 customer reviews of it on Amazon, with 590 giving it 5 stars while 248 haters rate it only 1 star. Both are fun to read, the raves for the over-the-top enthusiasm, the youthful spelling and grammar errors, and the heartfelt appreciation of the music; and the pans for the sour grapes, the skewering of her naivite and foibles, and the clever put-downs. I am rating it 2 stars, merely because only 32 other people chose that number, and I figure it will be easier to find. You can search the reviews by the ratings. Most people either loved or hated her, so I will be luke warm, just to stand out in the crowd.<br /><br />I really liked the song \\"My Happy Ending.\\" I heard it on the radio. I was listening to a station that plays a mix of old and new music, and though they play thousands of different songs, if they put it in the rotation you are likely to hear it 2 or 3 times in a month or so. That was enough for it to stick in my head, and make me wonder who it was. Not surprised that it was Avril, in fact she was my first guess (her song, \\"Complicated\\" also stuck in my head after hearing it a few times). The `happy beginning' goes a little like this:<br /><br />  Lets talk this over<br />  It's not like we're dead<br />  Was it something I did?<br />  Was it something you said?<br /><br />  Don't leave me hangin'<br />  In a city so dead<br />  Held up so high<br />  On such a breakable thread<br /><br />I really like the breakable thread image. The \\"In a city so dead\\" is my least favorite line. It doesn't really add anything, and distracts. Why is the city so dead? The song isn't really about the city, its mortality or lack thereof, and it seems like it was just inserted so the breakable thread line could rhyme with something. But I quibble. Don't know if Avril wrote this herself or not, but whoever wrote it has a way with words. I also like this verse, which is almost conversational, as it spins the story along:<br /><br />  You've got your dumb friends<br />  I know what they say<br />  They tell you I'm difficult<br />  But so are they<br />  But they don't know me<br />  Do they even know you?<br />  All the things you hide from me<br />  All the shizzle you do<br /><br />The music supports the song well, with a very dramatic build up, and a rousing, though somewhat ironic, chorus:<br /><br />  All this time you were pretending<br />  So much for my happy ending<br />  So much for my happy ending<br /><br />Finally, due to her mispronounciation of David Bowie's name, I wonder if she is even aware of the great song writers of the past such as Cole Porter, who wrote \\"I've Got You Under My Skin,\\" a song that was sung so well by Mr. Frank Sinatra? Was her album title a reference to it, or is she completely oblivious? I wonder, because each time I do, just the thought of you makes me stop--before I begin, `cause I've got Avril Lavigne UNDER MY SKIN.<br />[[ASIN:B00000AEVA Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]l, in fact she was my first guess (her song, \\"Complicated\\" also stuck in my head after hearing it a few times).

B000N6U0E2|5.0|The execution of the main role by Mr. Will Smith is beyond words, and it is hereby hoped that those who watch it    will appreciate the content of the movie as it is a true (albeit small part) reflection of the plight of the    \\"Brother\\" who has managed to survive \\"caving in\\" to the imposed eurocentric (mentally and physically draining)    pressures of survival that he finds constantly burdened on him as none of us were really given a choice to be born    into this world.    It must have taken a lot out of Mr. Will Smith to be able to embed himself into the shoes of the main character and   be able to produce realistic \\"acting\\" as good as he was able to just as Mr. Denzil Washington was able to do in the   recap of brother Malcolm X (RIPP).    Like I said, for those brothers who have escaped being dragged under by the system this is part of our collective    story of survival in a world and system we neither asked to be born into nor participated in its creation or    maintenance.    Needless to state, initially I thought the recap by Mr. Smith of Brother Mohammed Ali was good, but he has once again shown he can step into the shoes of the wider (voiceless) community at large which is much appreciated....all I can say Mr. Smith is ThanXs!

B000QUUD60|4.0|The original was poorly edited but the idea was to show the fans and the event that was ELVIS more than Elvis himself. The Special Edition is FANtastic... the man and the music. This two-disc package is awesome because you get more footage and more songs to listen to, the only shame is that the original doesn't have re-mastered sound like the Special Edition, but the DVD quality footage is much better and for many fans it will be the first time they will see the original that clear. A highly recommended purchase for all music fans, it is the best Elvis ever looked during the concert years.
B00005V9IJ|4.0|Cast away is weird. Weird when Tom Hanks befriends a volleyball, weird when he yells at the volleyball, weird when he constantly gets splashed by water on his makeshift raft ( as though a stagehand was simply throwing water off camera.) Mostly, weird when you realize that the movie manages to make a strong statement amongst the hours of survival \\"what not to-do's\\". that is, that life in unpredictable.<br /><br />Tom Hanks' character has all the priorities down. His job, time, working, and lastly his girlfriend/hope for fiance (Helen Hunt). When his Fed Ex plan goes down in the Pacific Tom's character has to find a way to live, for a long time on an island by himself with no supplies. This technical part of the movie is very interesting. Loneliness, desperation, fear, and pain make up the 4+ years he's stranded on the island.<br /><br />After fashioning a raft to escape on he's found adrift by a large shipping vessel. After getting home you see where his lesson lies ( although for some it may take too long to get there) that life is unpredictable, time waits for no man, and finally what really matters keeping your priorities straight.<br /><br />He realizes to take the work trip instead of staying home started the hole series of events. He realizes that if he had stayed home and never took the business trip he would be probably married to the girl of his dreams. Life is like that, you cant plan it. After seeing his ex fiance married with kids he realizes he just has to go on surviving, as a well written monologue at the end points out.<br /><br />I like that at the end, he is able to deliver one of the Fed Ex boxes he found after the crash. It belongs to a lady that started out the movie sending art to her husband overseas, whose cheating on her. By the end of the film you see the husband is out of the picture, she divorced him. She see's Tom at a crossroads and, after giving directions Tom realizes shes the lady who owns the ranch/art atudio and the last shot is of him looking at all the roads to take, metaphorically choosing his path, and he ends up looking down the road the lady just left on. Hinting that theres a reason for everything.<br /><br />Thats where the message lies. Accept your decisions, becuase as you look back if even one thing is differe nt you wouldnt be where you are. Tom's character has to go through a lot but the ending really does hint at the fact that with the artist lady, is where he was always meant to be. Pretty cool.o take, metaphorically choosing his path, and he ends up looking down the road the lady just left on. Hinting that theres a reason for everything.    Thats where the message lies.

B000VECAEO|1.0|The show that started off about nothing really did become the show that was nothing to rave about in the last season. Season 8 was when the show really starting to decline for me but it wasn't until the awful, terrible, horrible, despicable season 9 was when Seinfeld unfortunately totally lost the plot from it's original format. Any true Seinfeld fan knows since Larry David's departure after season 7 the show had changed its formula slightly but the change from season 8 to 9 was a completely different style of comedy which made absolute fools of all 4 characters. The story lines were becoming depressingly desperate, the characters were becoming more and more stupid and the dynamic between the four of them was out the window never to be seen again. I'm sure Jerry and the rest of the gang noticed the show had lost its steam by now so it was a great thing this was the last season. Put it this way it's a shame they didn't finish one season earlier, but it's even better they didn't go one more season further.

B0000E1ALR|2.0|You can't have an essential Bruce Springsteen compilation without including 2 of his biggest hits \\"Cover Me\\" & \\"I'm On Fire\\" especially over 3 discs, it's just unheard of. These 2 songs were also left out of the other Bruce Springsteen greatest hits cd, for what reason I don't know but something strange seems to be going on here. I'm not going to buy this release either because i'm sure one day the people who put these cd's together will hopefully get it right, maybe on the next Springsteen Best Of perhaps!!
0061170623|5.0|Tom Hollander who reads this book does a wonderful job. The slang that is used non-stop in this book can sometimes be hard to follow, but to have Tom, with an English accent read through these funny descriptive terms just makes the book. His voice acting just adds an extra dimension to the text that is enjoyable. I really can't say enough about the voice acting, it is top notch!    Now the book itself is top notch, too. It starts with the ultra violence of Alex and his droogs, and then veers into the brainwashing of Alex to try and get him back into society but without his violent urges. Well this causes problems with the religious types and some intellectuals who believe freedom of choice is more important than curing a person of his ill ways. And then it ends with such a simple statement of life, which I won't give away. It's an intellectual book which addresses moral and social problems in our society, and causes the listener to judge these actions that occur in the book.    The best thing about this book is, even though it was written in 1962, it does not feel dated in the least bit.
B00006I53S|5.0|I bought this lens in 2001 for my Elan IIe and now use it with my 30D.  It is not up to the standards set by the \\"L\\" lenses but I have never been disappointed by it.  My only critique is that on a crop camera the 28mm end is not really wide enough.  This would be supplemented well by the 10-22 or the 17-40.
1400063515|5.0|The Economist in the August 16th 2007 edition said   \\"The people at Goldman Sachs lost a packet when something happened that their computers told them should occur only once every 100 millennia\\"  (Surviving the market. Leader).  This is the way people made measurements in Mediocristan. But social sciences (and Economy IS A SOCIAL science) belong to Extremistan.   NNT, with his provocative prose, forces us to rethink everything what we have given obvious.  To give to the random the importance that it has in our lives, implies a philosophical and literary approach to the topic, since it is the only route to destroy the \\"solidly\\" constructed fallacys  of the platonic and academic thought.  An absolutely universal and advisable book.
0446310786|5.0|The book was fine, after I ordered it from Books A Million.

1401211909|5.0|The first I heard of this title was through the trailer for the movie. Since I did not know the story, I bought the book. I was very impressed. I like the way the story developed and the illustrations were outstanding. I did not matter that the movie differred substantially from the book, having read the book I knew what was happening and why. While the movie is suitable for youngsters, I feel that this book is not. The language and violence are too much, and the illustrations too graphic.

006113127X|3.0|Bukowski's work here is effective for two reasons; the honesty and the hilarity of his voice.  The bumming/drinking/gambling story wasn't new in 1975 and today even less so. But despite the eventually repetitive on-the-job and then losing-the-job musings, there is a open clarity and gasping laughter following Bukowski and his alter-ego's adventures, however small.    I think for all practical purposes, Factotum is a much more concise, effective and ultimately more entertaining work of prose than even Kerouac's \\"On the Road.\\"  The movie, on the other hand, is a little on the weak side.    Factotum comes in a little sparse and comes to drag in the final third, but its such a quick read, you hardly notice.  The \\"inhuman fury\\" of a prostitute, wondrous pleasures of using the bathroom and quiet solitude of simply walking off the job every day are all here for you to discover.  I say read it.
B000QFCD2W|4.0|Give me your soul...please delivers a creepy story only like king diamond knows how to tell. The follow up to the puppet master while the latter is a good cd i would say this is slightly better but not as good as the classic abigal. King usses less of his high pitch falletso vocals and more of his natural voice. And the female vocalist from the last release returns, her vocals are great but sparse mainly used on the last track moving on a great track. Not that their is a weak track on the cd all filled with king's great vocals and andy larouqes fantastic solos and guitar work. Some of the best playing since abigal. A metal soundtrack set to a fantastic horror story. Any king diamond fan should enjoy give me your soul....please immensley.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|This was a great movie.  Anthony Hopkins was great in his character as a wealthy and smart engineer.  Even though he was the bad guy, I was rooting for him all the way through the movie.  After all, his wife had been cheating on him which is why he shot her in the head.  Anthony's character gets himself off from the charge of attempted murder (the cheating wife is in a coma) but in the end the smart DA figures out how he had gotten the weapon out of the house and brings him up on new charges. This time it's murder because the cheating wife died in the hospital.  The movie ends with Anthony's trial starting so you are left to decide for yourself whether or not he was found guilty.  Since I was rooting for him all through the movie, I'm going to assume Anthony's character got the \\"Dream Team\\" to represent him and he's now playing golf in Florida.
078322611X|5.0|Kevin Costner is not one of the worlds' greatest actors. But he did make some great films, and this is his best.<br /><br />James Earl Jones is a great actor. I believe this is also his best movie. His character is critical to the plot, and he gives a wonderful performance. Ray Liotta turns in a slightly over the top performance as Shoeless Joe Jackson, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />This is a magical movie, for people who have some magic left in their hearts. Buy it and enjoy.
B000H305U0|4.0|This CD is awesome.  I wasn't even a fan of JT before I bought it but I love the beats he lays down.  It's really great feel good but especially dance music.  If you like dancing, this CD is for you.  It's great.  The only thing that bothers me is the length of some of the songs that slows down the pace a lot or is just irritating to hear.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Finally taking on World War II and it's effects on the nation of Holland, Paul Verhoeven is back. He hasn't really dealt with this type of material since \\"Soldier of Orange\\" decades ago. His last film was the abysmal Hollywood sci-fi movie \\"Hollow Man\\". So now Verhoeven returns to the arthouse cinema, first time in many years. His ballsy style is in full evidence once again, filled with action, violence and sex but not gratuitously used like he sometimes does. The story is filled with twists, turns and many surprises, never disappointing in the area of entertainment. Some may claim that this is a Hollywood film masquerading as an arthouse flick but don't be so quick to judge. Hollywood would quickly sanitize an audacious film like this if they had a chance to produce it, that's why Verhoeven went back to Europe to make this film.    As most reviewers have already summarized the necessary plot points, I won't dwell on them. Just wanted to write this review and say that Verhoeven is back as a director to watch! Hopefully his next film will be more ambitious and contain the same type of great storytelling but brought to different subject matter. So, go out and rent or buy Black Book if you care about this filmmaker or if you just like World War II movies in general. Although this film contains it's many cliches, at least it shows that not all Germans were evil. Sebastian Koch is the male lead alongside the lead character played by Carice van Houten.    The title of this film is a bit random as this so called Black Book has little to do with most of the movie and acts as a sort of problem solving plot point near the end. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a deus ex machina. In conclusion, a very entertaining film indeed and a return to form for this director. For the record, my favorite Paul Verhoeven film is and probably always will be... ROBOCOP.
B00006879E|5.0|I love this CD.  It is completely fantastic, I listen to it all the time.  I actually bought it from Amazon this time as a gift; I already have my own copy at home.  I recommend this CD if you like songs about love and/or loss and things in that category.  It's not emo and whiny at all though, it's all very well written and composed.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|The Lives of Others has received a ton of praise from critics and audiences around the world and I agree with the positive reception this film has garnered. It takes us into a world most people are not very familiar with and involves us in a story filled with questions concerning personal morality as opposed to public political action. However, if you're expecting this movie to be some sort of cinematic jewel of the early years of the 21st-century, you'll be very disappointed. Audiences who are not familiar with foreign cinema always overpraise recent foreign hits such as \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", \\"City of God\\", even the delightful \\"Amelie\\". The Lives of Others will now be another foreign film that American middle class consumers can identify and heap unwarranted enthusiasm upon.    But wait! Apparently the evil Hollywood powers are working on bringing this film to an even bigger public than the arthouse film dwellers. Supposedly The Lives of Others will get a remake in the near future, American style!    That sounds frightening indeed and we should be thankful for the success we already have here in front of us with the original film. The performances in this movie are very fine, especially the actor Ulrich Muhe who recently passed away from cancer. ( He plays the character of Weisler. ) This film will forever be a fitting memorial to his career.    Not everything in this movie works however. We get some Hollywood-esque sappiness creeping up on us from time to time, especially concerning the relationship between the writer ( Sebastian Koch ) and the actress ( Martina Gedeck ). The ending drags out a bit but ultimately finishes in a supremely endearing way. The final image is very genuine and makes you mourn the passing of the highly talented actor Ulrich Muhe.    I also liked the in-depth talk from the director which is an extra feature on this DVD. He delves into the musical aspects of this film in knowledgeable ways. Anyone who appreciates classical music will need to see this extra after seeing the movie. Got to love those Germans! They're very musical people.
075640407X|5.0|No, this isn't about a medieval monk who solves a series of murders on a plantation in Civil War-era Georgia. It's about a warrior/arcanist/musician/inn-keeper/tale-teller/who-knows-what-else.  It's easily the best fantasy novel to come along since, well, I don't know. In a world overrun with bloodless Tolkien rip-offs, this is enough the renew my faith in the genre. The tale of Kvothe is engrossing and bracingly original.<br /><br />It's not perfect. Mr. Rothfuss can be a little wordier than he needs to be, and there's too much repetition. But he writes with so much energy and imagination that it doesn't matter. I'm eagerly awaiting the next installment.
0792843584|2.0|This infamous movie has a bit of a cult following it seems. I didn't come to see this film because I wanted to watch a legendary disastrous production. I was compelled to watch from a more noble cause. I kind of enjoy Michael Cimino's grand operatic style. He is somewhat reminiscent of Sergio Leone, sometimes of Bernardo Bertolucci. Those Italian directors are clearly inspired by the great tradition of Italian opera stemming back to the days of Verdi. Michael Cimino is also of Italian heritage, so the operatic lifeblood is strong within him. Those epic feelings are perfectly suited to the landscape of the American West before it was civilized.    Having enjoyed \\"The Deer Hunter\\" and \\"Year of the Dragon\\", even if those films had their faults, I wanted to see Heaven's Gate and to fall in love with it. To love a movie that has been attacked by many critics. Unfortunately, that's just not reality. This is a 3 hour 40 minute monstrosity of a movie. If you are going to make a film longer than \\"Godfather Part II\\" or \\"Seven Samurai\\", as long as \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and nearly as long as \\"Gone with the Wind\\", you as the director have some things you need to do. Your plot must be multi-layered and flow naturally, your characters need to be compelling and evolving, your cinematography, music, art direction must be top of the line. Most of all the editing and pacing must be dead on, perfectly in synch to the needs of story that has clear direction and implications. You absolutely need an ambitious climax to end all climaxes. You at least strive for those things.    How does Heaven's Gate stack up? It fails and fails miserably. The movie looks good for the most part, it desperately needs some sort of cleaning up of the negative, a real remastering. The music doesn't have the emotional reach that inspired some of this director's other films. The characters are some of the most boring I've ever encountered in a so called epic. Remember Peter O'toole in \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" or AlecGuiness in \\"Bridge on the river Kwai\\"? Toshiro Mifune in \\"Seven Samurai\\", Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in \\"Godfather Part II\\"? Clint Eastwood in \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\", Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson in \\"Once Upon A Time in the West\\"? Who in this film is even remotely in that league of a quintessential character?    This is one of the dreariest films around. Special mention should go to the supporting characters, who play some of the biggest motormouthed, cartoonish clowns I've ever encountered in the movies. Since they play the roles of mostly fresh European immigrants, you can't understand much of what they are saying. That's not the issue. It's their handling by the director that's problematic. They become such a nuisance that you as the viewer cease to care about their fate! The villain is played by Sam Waterston of \\"Law and Order\\" fame. He's just there to cause problems, not much for him to do. John Hurt gives an idealistic speech at the opening of the film and then plays a disillusioned, idiot alcoholic for the remainder of the running time. Also introduced during this first scene at Harvard is the main character played by Kris Kristofferson who will journey out West in the coming years.    Speaking about that opening sequence... It is supposed to take place at Harvard, circa 1870, actually was filmed at Oxford in England. The opening scene with it's bloated pomposity establishes the character of the whole film. Even so, the over blown staging of the opening does contain energy and enthusiasm, something completely lacking from most of the remaining three plus hours.    After the death of Christopher Walken, ( one of the three main characters ), comes the climactic battle and it's unforgettable for it's sheer boredom, poor staging and editing. Then there is a ridiculously inserted shoot out scene that disposes of Sam Waterston ( the villain ), Jeff Bridges ( friend of the main character ) and the female lead Isabelle Huppert ( the love interest ). Completely out of the blue, coming after the main climax of the film, it is awful storytelling to try and wrap up this bad movie on an even worse note. But you haven't seen anything yet! Our protagonist Kris Kristofferson returns to his Eastern seaboard life, more than a decade has elapsed. He is on a luxurious yacht with presumably his wife. He lights her cigarette for her. No words are spoken. It is a cold and distant marriage. Kristofferson's ideals and passions are long behind him. He walks out from the yacht's cabin and we get a wide shot of him standing there. Finito! 3 hours and 40 minutes building to a lousy climax, poorly inserted death scene for major characters and a totally empty, absolutely predictable conclusion. How about I just watch the opening scene at Harvard and then skip to the epilogue? Makes a better movie without all the poorly build up nonsense.     This film does get to some viewers and the perhaps the first 1 hour and 30 minutes work on some level, simply from the visual splendour and over the top production design. As the clock keeps ticking away, you begin to understand that this film will not lead to any place significant. It will continue to meander in a half-hearted stew until your eyes glaze over from boredom and apathy. The absolutely lousy characterizations and go nowhere plot will make you yearn for the death of all these idiots! You almost get your wish, only Kristofferson lives to dull us for another day!    I'm not even going to go into the many historical errors and twisting of facts from which this film was conceived. I'm after cinematic poetry, not necessarily a history lesson. Based upon it's disgraced reputation, I wanted to discover some sort of lost gem of epic cinema that is overlooked by most film buffs. I already liked Michael Cimino's style somewhat. I did not find any hidden classic in Heaven's Gate. Not at all. It's considered a disaster for good reason. Cimino ran away with a head full of ambition and no way to turn that ambition into an even remotely palatable movie. Ok, one good thing. It was cool seeing the young Mickey Rourke onscreen. Even in a small role, he makes an impression.    Here's an idea for all you film lovers. How about watching Terence Malick's \\"Days of Heaven\\". 95 minutes of some of the most blissful moviemaking ever created. That is the very definition of a cinematic gemstone. Heaven's Gate on the other hand belongs in the dustbin of film history!
0440238609|3.0|It's actually been several years since I read this trilogy so my remembrance of the details is fuzzy, but I'm just here to share two overall impressions that stuck with me. First, Pullman is a gifted writer who has great mastery of the language, which I always appreciate. But by the end of the third book, I was mainly sad that someone with his talents had used them in a way that I personally found offensive. It also troubled me that these books would be a natural thing for children to pick up, and the way the offensive material builds slowly over the later books meant that they would already be into the story before it became really troubling. Parts of the third book struck me as nothing more than a sophisticated anti-God rant. That's obviously not going to bother some people, but it was enough to make me get rid of these books and not re-read them as I have with other great series that I've enjoyed.
B000001GQD|5.0|The great Russian pianist took up the cause for Rachmaninov's at the time much-maligned works. I'm an enthusiast of modern music but I can't resist the warmth of the Romantics either. In our hearts, I think more people have a Romantic sensibilily than a Modernist one.    The second of Rachmaninov's concertos is one of his most famous works and one of the most lushy and slushy in the Romantic piano/orchestral repertoire. The concerto was prominently featured in the David Lean romance \\"Brief Encounter\\". Obviously they didn't use this Richter recording since it didn't exist yet.    From the grave opening to the stunning slow movement and the scintillating energy of the finale, this recording has Richter delivering the goods for the benefit of his Russian countryman's music. Listen especially to the last 2 and a half minutes of the slow movement, Richter plays with such raptness and feeling, it is heart melting and dreamy. Guaranteed to drown you in beautiful sound! I haven't heard anyone else play with such understanding. If you want a comparison recording, try Van Cliburn with Fritz Reiner. It's another great performance but not as good as Richter's. The conductor working with Richter is Stanislaw Wislocki and he leads the orchestra from Warsaw.    The coupling on this CD is Tchaikovsky's 1st, a concerto that is even more famous than the Rachmaninov. Unfortunately Richter and the great Austrian conductor Herbert von Karajan did not see eye to eye in matters of interpretation. Karajan, conducting the Vienna Symphony ( not the Philharmonic! ) goes for the long line, the lush texture, the grand backcloth. Richter goes for more energy, trying to break free of Karajan's pompous orchestral back up. I love Karajan as a conductor but he doesn't collaborate well with instrumental soloists usually. It's a strange performance that doesn't compete with the more famous accounts of this masterpiece. But that does not matter, if you want the best recording of Rachmaninov's 2nd concerto, this CD is it.    Another reviewer accused this recording to be in poor sound. I can't understand his opinion. The sound for 1959 ( the Rachmaninov 2nd ) is terrific and the Original Image Bit-Processing remastering job from DG has given it extra depth and bass, which is a major plus. I don't find any reservations here, this is great. A must purchase for Richter enthusiasts!
B0000A98ZP|1.0|When did dysfunction become something you celebrate with evening family screenings on the courthouse lawn with funny hats, foam-filled chairs, sacs of nutritionless substances and an out-of-place Husker Du reference? Or is it? I like to split up into three sections and go zooming across the screen, feet up like hooks, tail grinding in the gravy. How does a director even convince human beings to act in such a manner? Hi, have you heard, I'm the nerd. Then they show it at the retro soc hop iGasm. And you take your disillusioned significant other, palms pasty, hands clasped awkwardly and tight, reaching toward one last empty grasp at what is now long past, becoming a biased memory. You know what a breakfast club is? It's where you compare the size of your sausages and -- ladies in da hizzo -- your eggs.

B000O76PEE|4.0|United Abominations (2007.), Megadeth's eleventh studio album<br /><br />Thrash metal gods Megadeth have been enjoying somewhat of a re-birth in the past few years. Following reforming Megadeth in 2004, Dave Mustaine put together some great material for the band's comeback album `The System Has Failed'. `TSHF' marked a great return to the classic sound of Megadeth, with all of the band's classic traits of speed, solos and energy. Since then, Dave has been able to recruit a permanent line-up for the band in the shape of the Drover brothers and James LoMenzo. One of the most anticipated metal releases of 2007, `United Abominations' catches Megadeth on a new outing of classic metal...<br /><br />Listening to `United Abominations' for the first time brought a real smile to my face. If Dave Mustaine proved to me and many other fans that he still had the ability to produce classic thrash metal on `The System Has Failed', he and the rest of the band really consilidate it here in  style. What `United Abominations' has over its predecessor album though is that the music feels like a true Megadeth CD. The reason for this is that a permanent line-up for the band play on this album whilst Dave had to get in session musicians for `TSHF'. There is much more chemistry in the sound of this album between the band members whilst on the previous album there were moments were the work felt like it was Dave Mustaine solo release. `United Abominations' is Megadeth fully back in their prime. The whole album is a strong showcase of metal songwriting. The songs speed along effortlessly with plenty of catchy hooks and riffs and there are plenty of classic Megadeth solo trade-offs between Mustaine and Glen Drover. Dave is also as usual stong in the lyrics department, making his political views known. It could be easy just to dismiss this album as one long political rant from Mustaine but it really isn't. The main theme of the album is clearly a criticism of the UN but Dave doesn't let that dumb down the whole sound of the album as he keeps a sharp focus with his words and weaves them into the underlying riffs very well. Just listen to `Washington Is Next' and you'll see exactly what I mean - theres some killer lyrics and they're backed by killer hooks. I was also highly impressed by the soloing of guitarist Glen Drover on this album. Filling the big shoes of past guitarists such as Marty Friedman ain't easy but he does the job excellently. The band overall are a strong musical unit once again and you can tell this on the album and if you are lucky enough to see them live.<br /><br />An nice acoustic intro lures the listener in at the start of the album in `Sleepwalker' before plenty of fast, catchy riffs kick in. This is a fantastic opening track with a powerful chorus, plenty of guts and some great solos. A perfect starter that is a taster of whats to come. `Washington Is Next' is a clear and precise political commentary from Mustaine but it is also a brutal 5 minute song with plenty of memorable hooks that rock hard. My personal favourite on the album, this song has everything you could wish for from a Megadeth song. `Never Walk Alone...A Call To Arms' has an awesome intro that casts instantly back to the days of early Megadeth. More great riffs are in this one on a cool, atmospheric section mid-way though. The epic title track `United Abominations' is next. The song contains a staple Mustaine spoken commentary to open the song which actually works quite well over some crushing chords. Once the meat of the song gets going, this is a fantastic hard hitting track with some great lyrics - `Poverty in the kitchens, held hostage by oil for food' anyone? My only criticism in this song is that I think Dave should have just stuck to an opening commentary and cut the outro one. `Gear Of War' is catchy and is a great sing along. Vintage Megadeth at its very best and rocks hard. An excellent staple that sounds brilliant live.<br /><br />`Blessed Be The Dead' isan excellent, apocalypse themed song that is another album highlight. The band sound great here, the intro is cutting and has you on edge and builds up excellently. Theres plenty more great lines especially in the chorus and there are some cool outro solos. `Play For Blood' is more classic Megadeth with lots of speed and aggression. There's solos aplenty in this one to keep you interested. Next is an great remake of `A Tout Le Monde', featuring Lacuna Coil vocalist Claudia Scribbia. Remaking such a hallmark Megadeth song may have damaged the credibility of the album but it actually works really well and doesn't destroy the flow. Although I prefer the original, I would never say no to hearing this excellent version of the song. The last 3 songs on the album are all solid songs however they are not quite up to the standards of the rest of the album. `Amerikhastan' has some good hooks but Dave loses focus just a little and descends into full rant mode! `Your Dead' is solid, with some good hooks and overall feel but the song doesn't quite grab me like some of the songs on the album. `Burnt Ice' is a very good finisher though with lots of crisp riffs that sound great. The high energy finish marks a powerful close to an excellent album.<br /><br />`United Abominations' yet again gives me pleasure to say that Megadeth are still a force to be reckoned with after all of these years. This new release from the band has some great songwriting, pretty concise and strong lyrics and most of all feels like a true old-school Megadeth album. I'm a huge fan of the band and new releases like this one will keep my faith with Megadeth strong for some time yet! 2007 has been a strong year for the metal genre so far and Megadeth's `United Abominations' is right there in the top of the mix. Highly recommended, Dave and Co. I salute you!<br /><br />MY RATING: 8.5/10song that is another album highlight.

B000RMQH30|5.0|It baffles me why Ben Harper doesn't receive more accolades than he does.  He's one of the best singer-songwriters around.  His performances are like vintage soul with new themes added to a timeless groove.<br /><br />\\"Lifeline\\" could be it--the CD that actually gets him those awards.  Til then, psst--you can say you liked Ben Harper early.<br /><br />Harper often traverses the whole emotional gamut in his music and \\"Lifeline\\" is no different.  His opener, \\"Fight Outta You\\" could be a father's advice, a commencement speech, or just a pick-me-up on a bad day:<br /><br />it will be in your honor<br />'til you're not needed any longer<br />don't believe the headlines<br />check it for yourself sometimes<br />the lies you live become you<br />the love you lose it numbs you<br />they say that you've arrived<br />that's just a high class bribe<br />don't let them take the fight<br />outta you<br /><br />\\"In the Colors\\" is the hit from this CD if KGSR-Austin's playlist is any indication.  It's another song that offers hope to the hopeless:<br /><br />when you again start hoping<br />with your arms wide open<br />dance with me into the colors<br />of the dusk<br /><br />If you're a fool for train songs like I am, you're going to love \\"Fool For a Lonesome Train.\\"  You can almost hear the whistle in the rain.<br /><br />Several songs deal with lost love, including \\"Younger than Today.\\"<br /><br />\\"Lifeline\\" has something for just about every mood and I can honestly say that most of the tracks stand out in one way or another.  It's very hard for me to believe that Harper and the Innocent Criminals managed to record this CD in 7 days in Paris, but if anyone could, this talented group is the one!

B000002J29|5.0|I had the vinyl when I was in high school and wore it out in college.  If you love older Genesis, this is the album for you.  Peter Gabriel has a wonderful voice, but I really like the way Phil vocally went after the songs much better.  Peter went more for visual theatrics, and Phil did more experimenting with tone, range and inflection.  Three sides live is probably their best live album for me, but this is second only by a fraction.  Just know that you won't find pop hits on this one, but solid progressive rock.
1400079179|2.0|I've been meaning to read 'The Da Vinci code' for several years now, but there were always tons of other books on my reading list. I finally went ahead and read it, just to figure out what the hype was all about.<br /><br />One thing that immediately comes to attention is the overall quality of writing, which is mediocre at best. Dan Brown's overuse of flashbacks is particularly annoying. Most of these flashbacks do not have any significance whatsoever on the plot, but is just a convenient way to reveal new information. Not only does this distract the reader from the storyline, it also leaves you with the feeling that Brown was either too lazy or too incompetent to incorporate his information in a more natural way.<br /><br />Brown does try to keep his writing fast and simple, and he does a good enough job at maintaining a steady pace in his book. However, he isn't able to avoid sounding too rushed and simplistic at times. He also often takes on a lecturing tone, giving you the feleling that he's looking down on the reader's intelligence. Character development is non existent as well, as all the characters remain two-dimensional figures, and there is no emotional attachment toward any of them whatsoever.<br /><br />The plot itself also isn't particularly original; and you could see most of the plot \\"twists\\" from a mile away. The Teacher's identity especially, was so obvious at a certain point, that it was almost embarassing to see Brown trying to hide it in a not so subtle way<br /><br />However, the puzzles and \\"facts\\" in the book are interesting enough to make the reader keep reading and forgive Brown his quality of writing, even if he tends to get his facts wrong, as many readers have remarked upon already. The puzzles were ingenious, but in some cases, you would expect a learned cryptologist, symbologist and historian would have less trouble with some these clues, since even I was able to figure out a couple of these puzzles.<br /><br />In conclusion, Brown relies too much on his ideas, and fails to pay much attention to the actual quality of writing, and to the character and plot development. It is enjoyable enough if you have some time to kill, and if you're not looking for anything too demanding.ay much attention to the actual quality of writing, and to the character and plot development.

1594200823|5.0|\\"What should we have for dinner?\\" A simple and complex dilemma that is the center of this wonderful book, the best non-fiction I've read for years. Pollan's writing is balanced, erudite and engaging. He is first and foremost a very good writer. The chapters on corn and the ethics of eating animals in particular are beautifully written. This book is more than a scientific thesis, it is bedtime reading, dinner conversation, and a necessary classroom textbook . Pollan attacks the topic with energy, curiosity and humility, which is how we should eat each and every meal. Bravo Senor Pollan.
B000RMQH30|5.0|Ben Harper is relatively more famous here on Italy than on USA, I saw him play live for the first time on a small club on 1995 when he was unknow.  One of the most emotional concert of my life.  I saw him live last time at the end of 2006 during the european tour, few months before recording this wonderful CD.  I like almost every B.H. CDs, but I love way more is live performance ant this album reflect all the intensity of the long tour just done.  On the first concert was his guitar skill to stand, on the last was his voice...  ...I will never forget when while performing \\"Where Could I Go\\" (from the CD with \\"Blind Boys of Alabama\\") he just make the (great) band to stop playing  and resume singin' alone outside of the mic, no amplification, only pure emotion!  This is the feeling you can find on this piece of art.  So (if you love this kind of music) buy it!  And if you can, GO to see one of his live concert...

B00005JPLW|3.0|Well this movie is making of history again. I like the spartons & the king spartus. well frank miller is good at movies like that. And the backgrounds of the movie is not okay for my knowledge. Comparing with \\"Sin City\\" this movie is far away from it.    Anyhow I loved this movie only a little. The best parts are the action sequences. the way the blood spreads around everywhere is fantastically done. Good special effects though.    ZT
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I was disappointed by the books that inspired this series - the premise of a serial killers serial killer was different, but I felt that the writing/stories failed to live up to the potential.  However, changing the medium to television creates a much better product.  The supporting characters that are somewhat flat in the books are vibrant, alive, and almost as interesting as Dexter.  The theme drifts from the nature of good and evil, to what makes us human, and the story takes on new life.
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice in Chains, Faith No More, Black Sabbath, King's X, Galactic Cowboys, Anthrax: all bands who are composed of great musicians. It's to bad a lot of the general public is more interested in something that sounds radio friendly instead of you know, music. Not that AIC wasn't popular, people knew of them but what their ears couldn't hear was how great they were. Most of them that is, some know the true wonder this band holds. Much better than Nirvana, who were WAY overrated, much better than Pearl Jam, who are okay but nothing that's anything, and Soundgarden who were almost something that was anything. This band to me took anything that was great from those bands and made it what they made it: great music. Some people may not like Staley's vocals or Cantrell's guitar, they call it musical taste. I call knowledge of what is and what isn't good music. Just like movies, you have to know what makes them good. It's not opinion, it's knowing. I once heard someone say the Dawn of the Dead remake was one of the most emotional movies she'd ever seen. I nearly vomited all over her. Hollywood's horrible writers and directors is a whole other story though, and as for this album like the title said it's great. Would? is my favorite song, I can't get enough of it. All the songs are enjoyable, Sickman is fun being purposly over the top. It's a great album. If you haven't heard of those other bands at top, which you should have heard of Anthrax and Black Sabbath at least, check them out. Also check out Devin Townsend and 24/7 Spyz. This is a great album, just look at all the other high star reviews to prove it. I hope the people who said Godsmack were better aren't serious, because if they are...that's just really too bad for them.
0743496728|5.0|Jodi Picoult writes an excellent story of how bullying can be taken to it's furthest point.  She captures the hurt and confusion of adolescents who have been bullied since starting school.  One feels they are actually part of the story.  It also looks at the insecurity of those on the fringes of popularity and the fragile position popularity brings.  This is a quick read for anyone wanting to understand how someone could become so unstable they would commit such a crime.  It also includes some of Picoult's trademark twists and turns.

0131103628|5.0|C is easily the most important programming language.  Windows, Linux, etc, are written in C.  Most computer languages are written in C.  There's a reason for this: speed and control of computer resources.  The virtue of speed is self-evident.  The virtue of proper stack, cache, memory, and I/O management is just as significant.  Learning to program in C teaches you to respect and get the most from the computer's hardware.  This is especially true if you program in other languages.  C also teaches coding discipline.      This book is not an easy read.  It's a rewarding read.  It does not code for you; it does not hold your hand.  (As in anything else in life, hand-holding retards your development.)  To become good at coding, you need to practice a lot.  You need to fail a lot.  You need to climb over your frustrations and plug away until you \\"get\\" it.  C won't give you instant gratification like PHP, Perl, Ruby, et al.  Instant gratification is overrated, especially when it comes to computer programming.  Haste so often makes waste.    I do not claim that learning C is mandatory for being a good programmer in another language.  I will claim, however, that if you're solid in your C skills, then you will be a good programmer with a very marketable skill that will differentiate you from the masses who have no clue about things like spatial locality or two's complement, etc.     If you have a true desire to become a superior programmer in any language, buy and read this book.

If you like smooth jazz, you will appreciate Diana Krall. Diana is one of the newer artists that really distiguishes herself from the rest of the pack. This CD never gets old.

The films fine pacing and direction is delivered by \\"multiple hit\\" director George Stevens and he is perhaps the reason why the film worked so well. Van Hefflin, Jack Palance, and Brandon De Wilde add their own signature elements which highlight the film along with the photography of sultery scenery.
057507390X|5.0|Brilliant stuff.  He had me hooked and mesmerised from the first line, basically.  Happy to read anything he writes, currently.  I can still vividly recall the first scene from the book.  An ex-mercenary with special 'psychological chameleon' type abilities to blend in locally, is now hired to find out why an incredibly wealthy functionally immortal man was killed.  People have the ability to load their personalities into other bodies, or new bodies, and this is how people travel from planet to planet, at times.
B00005JLF5|3.0|I started buying these sets when they were on sale for a way better price I liked the series decently enough but for the most part have kept my true love for BABYLON 5 more in my heart.Many Trekies might feel insulted but lets face facts if not for a major film company and large budget for the sets and special CGI affects most people would have passed the series off.I'm not saying all the actors were bad but the first series dealt with the crew trying to get to know each other and the single episode problems that would happen on the station.Than in season two you had the terrorist federation colonist the \\"Marquis\\" being formed and causing trouble,And of course near the end of season two and following mostly to the finale the powerful empire from the Gamma Quandrant the \\"DOMINION\\".I felt that when the writers came up with the dominion they were basically coping the SHADOW WAR conflict from BABYLON 5 to help their drop in ratings.This being said if you feel the price is right(No Pun Intended)for the season sets than by all means go for it but all I can say is check out BABYLON 5 season sets first you will not be disappointed.
1857235800|4.0|A young scientist is a dedicated researcher, astronomer and SETI type.  She detects a signal from space and finally works out what it is, in that it is instructions from a group of aliens on how to build a machine that will allow transport/or communication with them.    A fairly understated style of story, the heroine has to deal with the self serving politicians and the religious nuts to try and get the job done.
1932100660|1.0|Why not have a \\"Zero Star\\" review? Or better yet, a \\"Negative Star\\" review. Because this book would definitely qualify for a \\"Negative Star\\" rating!<br /><br />This publication is not only hogwash that leaves out most of the actual \\"China Study\\" data, but interestingly leaves out a lot of other data that is clearly pertinent to who the author is, what agenda and biased attitude he brings to this publication and what political purposes are actually being served by what is masquerading as a \\"health book\\"<br /><br />This doesn't even appear to be the real data of \\"The China Study\\". The fact of the matter is that Campbell takes data and:<br /><br />1. Slants the data so that it is misleading.<br /><br />2. Completely misinterprets the data - in some cases making concluding statements in regards to specific data when the data clearly (even to a layman) showed just the opposite!<br /><br />3. Misrepresents of what the data actually said!<br /><br />In his \\"so-called\\" rebuttal, Campbell NEVER does really address any of the valid points that critics have specified in this work. Those points of criticism being:<br /><br />1. Why did Campbell repeatedly claim in his book that \\"The China Study\\" demonstrates the value of a low-protein, low animal fat diet when the actual data from the study show absolutely no such thing?<br /><br />2. Why does Campbell dump on protein incessantly but fail to mention the research demonstrating the great potential value of animal proteins in general and even medical properties of whey protein? If he is the protein expert he repeatedly portrays himself to be, he should be well aware of this research.<br /><br />3. Why did Campbell claim that Dr. Lester Morrison's successful heart disease trials showed the value of a low-protein diet, when the participants did NOT eat a low-protein diet? Dr. Morrision himself described it as a high-protein diet! Get that??? A high protein diet... and yet Campbell claims the trial somehow demonstrates the value of a LOW protein diet!!!<br /><br />4. Why did Campbell claim that there are virtually no nutrients in animal-based foods that are not better provided by plants? (This claim is not only absolutely untrue, but so absurd as to be laughable - if it wasn't so sad!)<br /><br />A historical author who spoke of the physical fitness and health differences between the Chinese soldiers and Mongol warriors who had invaded north China at that time (early 13th century) commented that the Jurched (Chinese) leaders noted with surprise and disgust the ability of the Mongol warriors to survive on little food and water for long periods... the entire (Mongol) army could camp without a single puff of smoke since they needed no fires to cook. Compared to the Jurched soldiers, the Mongols were much healthier and stronger. The Mongols consumed a steady diet of meat, milk, yogurt, and other diary products, and they fought men who lived on gruel made from various grains (cereals).

0575076917|4.0|An alternate Earth is able to be accessed via a dangerous technology, and it seems this Earth is part of an experiment, and technology is stalled at around 1950.    An explorer goes back to have a look at the situation, so we get some period piece type low key thriller as well as the SF explanations.  Almost a little hard to explain.    In the real Earth there are two political forces at work, the Slashers and the Threshers, arguing over an Earth devastated by technology, the former lives on the planets, the latter in artificial habitats, and differ on how they employ technology in their bodies.    Yes, there is a Slashdot joke in this one, too.

0307010856|5.0|I have loved this book ever since I read it to my oldest son (who's now 16) and I recently re-purchased it for my one year old and one of my nephews. They both love this book as much as I do. It's an adorable little story!
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|How many of us hide our real personalities under a politically and/or socially acceptable mask? Yes the subject matter is a bit macabre, (socially acceptable serial killing) but I can't wait to see the next season. Dexter is one of the best dramatic series I've ever seen. Michael C. Hall is totally believable as a blend able monster stalking his twisted prey at night in the streets of picturesque Miami. And before you know it you find yourself secretly cheering for Dexter. Given the level of violence roaming the streets of our nation, it's refreshing to imagine the hunters being hunted and put down; subsequently, protecting our loved ones. The reason I gave it four stars instead five, is because I went back thru the series to watch the episodes along with the commentary, only to find that only a few episodes had additional commentary; which was disappointing. Aside from that the series was great!
B000QEIOTO|5.0|This movie was already great but in HD DVD it looks 10 times better i      recommend people to buy it
B000NA77YO|5.0|I always find it quite humorous how fans will rally behind one individual (i.e. Ozzy), and not give anyone else a chance. For example, the band Black Sabbath, who has seen more lead singers and line up changes more so than any other bands out there. The Ozzy era of Black Sabbath was great, with many of classic tunes offered by Oz, Iommi, Butler, and Ward (but from this writers perspective grew tired and old by Never Say Die!). Ronnie James Dio breathed new life into a tire band, and the two original entries (Heaven and Hell, and Mob Rules) are classic metal albums, which easily can stand toe-to-toe with the previous Oz albums. This compilation is a great collection of the Dio ear of Black Sabbath, but I agree with many of the previous reviewers, why was the song \\"The sign of the Southern Cross\\" left out?! That is probably one of the Dio's era's strongest songs, far better than Heaven and Hell. The newer songs added to the collection are pretty good; especially the first single released \\"The Devil Cried\\". It would be awesome to see the band continue with Dio at the helm and release a full studio album after the tour concludes (we can only hope).
0738702994|5.0|I bought these from a store here in town, adding them to my growing collection of tarot cards.  The cards seem to me to be decent quality construction wise.  They aren't super heavy duty, but aren't super flimsy... right in the middle.  As far as being too slick to handle, I've no problem with this.  They are much easier to handle than some other decks.  I love their size, my favorite size of all my decks, and the artwork is stunning.<br /><br />My readings with the this deck, however, are lacking.  I am spot on with my traditional Rider Waite, and I've finally come into the Tarot of the Old Path (another great deck), but this deck thus far eludes me.  I've taken a Celtic Mythology class at college and have read tales here and there... but the important thing for a deck to work is that the symbols within are meaningful for you.  This deck keep the minor arcana very similar to the Rider Waite, but the Major Arcana is much different, based instead on Celtic myths from a Welsh perspective.<br /><br />The added literature and story backgrounds for the Major Arcana is a true treat.  I would LOVE for the creator of this deck to make just a faery tale book of the stories presented in this deck.  That would be a true gem to go on anyone's bookshelf.<br /><br />The back is a bit tight to fit the cards in and out of easily.  My cats have fallen in love with the beads on the edge of the bag.  So I've given it to them.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Having been a Van Halen fan for numerous years (I have liked Roth, Hagar, and even the Cherone entry very interesting), I have always regarded their first album as the quintessential rock album. It shows the flare of Eddie's guitar style, the strength of Roth's voice (does not seem that strong now), and just the overall tight sound produced by Michael and Alex. This album has some great tunes, and is strong from start to finish, if you do not own a copy of this album I would strongly urge you buying a copy and enjoy the music!
B000OQF6N6|3.0|Billy Corgan has some demons to exorcize.  Maybe it was the on and off status of the Smashing Pumpkins over the past seven years that made it happen.  Maybe it was the foray into side and solo projects that has characteristically followed aging rock stars for decades.  Maybe it was just because so much of what makes it to rock radio these days is a watered down version of what he did with the Pumpkins.  No matter: \\"Zeitgeist\\" has a bone to pick, and if it isn't obvious by the end of \\"Doomsday Clock,\\" another twenty overdubs of distorted Stratocasters won't make it clear to you either.<br /><br />Make no mistake though: what little this album does, it does well.  We've got the cliched \\"wall of guitars\\" sound.  We've got a drummer who sounds like he's in his stadium-touring prime.  We've got abstract lyrics and melodic hooks.  And we've got all of it being repeated 12 times.  \\"United States\\" is an epic track that exploits all of this.  The aforementioned \\"Doomsday Clock\\" and \\"Bleeding The Orchid\\" are also standout examples of Corgan's finest mid-90's writing.  But, imagine \\"Mellon Collie\\" without artistic stretches like \\"Stumbleine,\\", \\"Beautiful,\\" and \\"33,\\" and you get the idea.<br /><br />Criticizing Billy Corgan for his control issues and lambasting him for the decision to call this a Smashing Pumpkins album are trivial musings when you actually pay attention to what he wants: the music.  Whether D'Arcy was there to look pretty in the liner notes or James Iha was present to nab his standard quota of two songwriting credits is irrelevant, this is still a rock and roll album, and an overtly cathartic one at that.  If you demand the trademark Pumpkins diversity in your Corgan writing, better go revisit \\"The Aeroplane Flies High.\\"  But if you, like Billy, needs to purge something, this will more than adequately do the job.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|one of the best bands ever and best cds ever(next to absolution)! its a new age rock style with a little less hard rock and more of a dance like beat, which i think will continue with their next cd. its not as good as the other cds for old fans that like muse for their fast melodic hardcore rock style. the difference is the electronic beat and more vocals which gives it the dance style. despite the changes with black holes. it still muse and has the core sound of the old muse and has the alt hard rock style like tool. now with 70+ songs theres an array of different rock stylesfrom muse. muse has a song everyone will love.        almost all bands go through some sort of musical style change, luckily this is probably the best change muse couldve made to get very high recognition in the states. i got it the first day and got it signed (the cd looks better autographed). all i think you should do is get this cd if you already dont have it!!! you wont regret it.

B000VAPZM2|5.0|I really don't understand the negative reviews for this movie as I found it to be really great.  As usual, one wonders if they saw the same film.  This movie was made to appeal to pre-teen and teen viewers and it's been a hit with them this summer.  I'm not a teen, but I've always loved teen movies and I found it terrific.  I've had lots of kids say positive things to me about this movie and so I know it was well received.  I'm just so glad that musicals are popular again as I've always liked that genre.  Music has a way of touching people in ways that a regular film just can't.  Yes, this film has been marketed, but I have to say that to market successfully you have to have a good product (which this is).<br /><br />Ok, we all knew that the movie producers would have a really hard time matching the success of the first movie which was a real classic.  This movie came so close to being even better than the first.  I think what did this was the outstanding music, vocal performances of Zac & Vanessa, and choreography.  Also, the \\"romantic quotient\\" is quite high and there are plenty of romantic scenes for those of us who like those kind of movies. Zac and Vanessa have a lot of onscreen chemistry & their real love for each other really shines through on film. I can see that there are a few scenes that are going to get 'stuck' in my dvd player! :) Also, the message is very good about staying true to yourself and making the most of opportunities while you are young.  If you go off the track, it means nothing and you can lose sight of what's really important and become someone you don't want to be.  There are more positive messages as well, and I think that's one of the things that is so great about these movies.<br /><br />Extended version?  This makes me happy because it seems to mean extra features and perhaps deleted scenes.  Yipee!  It should be great.  December 11th can't come soon enough.  Also, the idea of a 3rd movie about their prom in theatres is exciting to me.  I say, bring it on...there aren't enough great movies like these.ing it on...there aren't enough great movies like these.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I fell in love with the novel as a pre-teen and have read it over and over through the years.  What perfect reading for a blustery fall evening or winter afternoon.  I have always been disappointed in the screen versions, and there have been many over the years.  The story is full of passion, courage, and strength of character, not only in Rochester, but in Jane as well.  This remake FINALLY gives the performance that is worthy of the title.  I love it.
B00005ASHM|5.0|To those who haven't a clue....... Listen again. You're missing it!!!! One of the greatest albums ever? Deceptively so! You have to understand first that Brian Wilson's genius was taking sophisticated musical ideas and making them accessible - almost simple. As in \\"Don't Talk\\" you must \\"listen! listen! listen!\\" (By the way, one of the finest moments of this album).     Brian Wilson was also a master at moving each of these songs through time. Although the musical/lyrical elements making up each song are staggering, every track moves effortlessly and unencumbered.  The melody  of \\"God Only Knows\\" for example, is understatement at best moving over layers of complex harmonies/sounds/vocals through a unsentimental steady chiming. A masterpiece. I just can't get enough of that song. Absolutely breathtaking. The pity is that so many people \\"Frank Sinatra\\" the song and absolutely butcher it. There should be law against it.    I have to admit I'm no Beatles fan --- I`m sure they're great - history and legions of fans say so  - I just don't happen to \\"get\\" them ---I just don't hear it ---- There is not one Beatles song that I have ever heard that I liked enough to listen to again. (I've heard many countless times - not by my choice.) And I have never listened to an entire Beatle's album through.  I just don't get how \\"Yellow Submarine\\" compares to \\"God Only Knows.\\"  I guess I need to listen to an entire album to get a clue. As a previous reviewer stated - it's comparing apples and oranges. The level of sophistication as far as I can tell is directed in different areas. The Beatles were clever, musically gifted and creative. Brian Wilson was (still is - up for debate) a genius  - like I said ..... apples and oranges......    Getting back to \\"Pet Sounds\\" a musician can easily discern the musical genius, however (as someone previously stated) for the average listener (and musician alike) it's an experience that has to \\"hit you\\".  It's either there or not. You either \\"get it\\" oryou \\"don't.\\"      So for those of you who don't have a clue, if you will give \\"Pet Sounds\\" another try, I'll give the Beatles' a listen or two or three or four..... Maybe we'll both \\"get\\" it.

032147404X|5.0|I purchased this book to make better use of a Canon EOS 5D full frame digital camera I purchased. The book is straight to the point, it has practical and executable instructions on a variety of items, for instance: how to shoot portraits of large groups of people. How to shoot children. A quick and simple Photoshop workflow. Recipes for the most varied settings like travel photography, portraits, children, marriages. I believe a professional photographer would not be impressed with how simplistic some explanations are, but a beginner to intermediate photographer will appreciate both how simple the recipes are, and how intuitive they are, once you grasp some basic concepts.<br /><br />The book is so good I am now going to purchase a similar title from the same author for Photoshop. Not that the contents can't be found on the internet, but for the summary of the recipes. Great investment!
0739340131|4.0|You might think this looks pretty silly, but it is actually played pretty straight, not over the top zombie splatter horror with a lone band of survivors.  More an alternate history.    If you remember a MASH episode or two where they did it interview style, this is more of the feel of the sort of thing you get here.    Brooks gets the tone of the different characters as the interviewer goes around talking to people in all different countries to gather accounts.
0689878451|5.0|There is no such thing as a homosexual penguin. Penquins are birds not people and according to the dictionary homosexuals are people of the same sex who engage in joint sexual activities. I repeat, penguins are birds not people and animals should not be held to human standards or a lack of human standards. In fact some animals appear to live by a higher standard and charity than many humans.     This story is about family love and the nurturing of children, something we should all aim for.
0613667662|3.0|I keep looking at Fables, and thinking 'that looks cute, but not fabulous'.  Looks like I was right.  I would probably give this 3.25 if I could.    The good Fables have been chased out of fairyland by the bad Fables, so to speak, and now live in, ho-hum, New York City, a massively innovative and different setting for a comic, not.  The ones that look like, say, pigs or rats, have to live on a farm in the country.    The local political enforcer, Snow White, has a sister, Rose Red, who disappears, and her apartment is covered in blood.  So the local sherrif, Bigby Wolf (yes, bad name pun), has to turn detective to investigate.    Rose Red was due to be married, and it turns out her fiance was Bluebeard, so along with current shaggee Jack, and a few of the others mentioned earlier, the Wolf has a bunch of people to talk to, including a good for nothing, layabout Prince Charming.    Planetary or Sandman level this is not, but it is solid.
075640407X|5.0|This outstanding fantasy debut from Patrick Rothfuss exceeds all expectations. Tolkien fans will be enthralled, Harry Potter fans will rejoice, and even non-fantasy readers will be held spellbound by the captivating story of Kvothe. Rumors of Kvothe make him out as everything from a gallant hero to the basest villain. Chronicler, a famous debunker, searches for this larger than life character and believes that the unassuming proprietor of the Waystone Inn may hold the answers. Is this the man that was expelled from the Arcanum at a younger age than most are allowed to enroll, then slew a dragon, burned a town to the ground, committed regicide, survived an encounter with a fae enchantress and left with his sanity? Readers frustrated with some of the recent \\"fantasy-mill\\" books--which are poorly written and have feeble plots--will delight in the brilliantly realized world of Kvothe. Well suited for both adults and teen.

B000JVSUS4|4.0|So a film that in standard definition was average at best, is really brought to life and justice is done to it on Blu-ray.

B000000XCD|4.0|What more do you want?  When you buy a CCR album, you know what you're getting... they never really strayed too far from their \\"signature sound.\\"  Solid rhythym, with nice guitar work as usual from J. Fogerty (that distinctive swampy blues guitar - I believe a Rickenbacker)... If I knew the songs on the album off the top of my head, I would rank them, or do something cute like that... but, I don't so I'll just say again that this album is worth the measely $9.00 or whatever Amazon charges for it.  Vintage CCR.
0552149519|3.0|Very, very ordinary.  A hodge-podge of infodumps of research and characters you don't learn anything about, it seems.  That, and a crud ending. The writing is just average. Religiously soft, I suppose, is why people like it a lot, or that a lot of people have never been exposed to or read anything at all like that ever before.

0380788624|4.0|A great, rambling novel. At times the rambling and wandering can lead to it seeming to become tedious, and sometimes the rambling is good.    Some discourse on computer systems, as three university friends are  working in different parts of the world during the war, all having  studied the same sort of cryptanalysis.    There is a lot more than that in this geeky tract, however.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This CD caught me off-guard.  I've been a Crue fan ever since Too Fast For Love and had no idea that this was even in the works.  I was skeptical at first but I soon learned that this is an incredibly powerful CD loaded with great music.  It's nice to see that Nikki Sixx is very versitile musically rather than trying to shove a Shout at the Devil II down our throats.

0552131067|5.0|Terry Pratchett here came up with one his three best characters.  Ok, he didn't make him up, but the earnest deadpan characterisation, and the use of capitalisation to signify Death speaking works wonderfully well, and is a lot of fun.

0375836675|4.0|Australian YA author Markus Zusak's I AM THE MESSENGER is a likable little production wherein lovable loser, Ed Kennedy the Taxi Cab Driver, ultimately makes the fare of his life by figuring out, then fulfilling, the strange missions left in his letter box.  These cryptic tasks are written on playing cards -- the aces, to be exact -- and all involve helping others to find their Frank Capra moments (It's a Wonderful Life meets Oz).  Ultimately, \\"the messenger\\" (the original title, by the way), delivers a moral which is uplifting, even if the plot used as a vehicle is not entirely believable.  Nevertheless, endeared readers will willingly go along for the ride and feel all the better for it once they arrive.<br /><br />Strengths of Zusak's novel include characterization and suspense.  Among Ed's card-playing band of not-so-merry losers are Marv, a money-hoarding loner; Ritchie, a ne'er-do-well, lazy, professionally-unemployed type; and Audrey, the requisite, sad-eyed beauty who calls Ed her best friend while calling many other males her lovers.  Man's best friend is amply represented by the Doorman -- Ed's smell-to-the-high-heavens German Shepherd -- and heavies Keith and Daryl, who put the hurt on him in their own inimitable style, giving the novel a twisted comic kick.  Ed's mom?  She loves to hate him. His brother Tommy?  He gets all the girls and attention.  And his alcoholic father?  Alas, he took his last mortal swig a year before the story's first page.<br /><br />Zusak pulls the ensemble together for a predictable conclusion (though you best leave logic at the door when it comes to the \\"mystery character\\").  Young readers will love the book's brisk style which includes many, many one-sentence paragraphs.  And teachers will want to stock this for classrooms of high schools only -- despite the cheerful life lessons, the book is heavy with the sort of profanity that might raise all but the most liberal middle school parents' (or the school committee's) eyebrows.  Adults as well as teens can enjoy the book, however, as its winsome style and free-wheeling protagonist will make all but the most hard-hearted reader want to cheer Ed on as he finally plays the winning card...as teens can enjoy the book, however, as its winsome style and free-wheeling protagonist will make all but the most hard-hearted reader want to cheer Ed on as he finally plays the winning card...
0440180295|3.0|Vonnegut has written an anti-war book, but he has done it with some style. It is perhaps hard to find humor when you are being blown to hell and back, but through characters in this novel he manages to do so. Darkly amusing, I suppose is what you would call it at times. One way to view the Allied bombing of Dresden, anyway.
0571225381|5.0|In a world full of \\"good\\" books, Remains of the Day stands out as a truly amazing one. It speaks to Kazuo Ishiguro's talent that such a simple plot about a reserved English butler could be so engrossing and heartbreaking. The end of the book is especially powerful, and likely to leave any reader thinking about it long after they've finished. This is easily the best work of Ishiguro and, in my opinion, one of the best modern novels out there. Not to be missed.
1852862912|5.0|At at time when war has caused problems for much of the world, the English have elected leadership from a far right religious part.  Bad mistake.    This group takes over and moves quickly to totalitarianism, deciding that Orwell's Big Brother is a pretty good plan.  Anyone different is rounded up, and dissenters are disappeared.    One of their experiments has gone slightly wrong, and a man is now in a position to do something about it, especially with the superhuman talents he now possesses.    The main focus is on the responsibilities of government to the people, and the people's responsibility to eliminate their bad governments through violence, is necessary.  When does anarchy become revolution, and how far do you go to gain allies and aid in the process.

B000O5AYCA|5.0|The National is one of those bands that grows on you.  When I first heard \\"Fake Empire\\" I was pretty impressed, however, when I heard the rest of the album I didn't know what to think.  After listening to it for a week or so I started noticing myself singing some of the songs at work. \\"Fake Empire\\" seems like a song that wouldn't come first on the playlist, however, it ends up fitting in pretty well.  Its slow tempo but fast fingered piano part starts off the album.  The vocals are very low keyed but passionate. \\"Fake Empire\\" catches your attention \\"Mistaken for Strangers\\" is your first test.   It turns the whole album around and throws a different beat at you with a completely different melody.  The chorus seems overwhelming at first but don't worry, soon you will be singing it to yourself at work.  \\"Brainy\\" is one of my favorite songs on the album.  Don't let the drum beat distract you.  Listen to the vocals as the centerpiece. \\"Squalor Victoria\\" is a song that I never thought I would like.  Starting off with an amateur drum beat with a happy feel can instantly be turned around with the simple pluck of a bass string.  You'll find that out in this song. \\"Slow Show\\" and \\"Apartment Story\\" both have catchy choruses.  Not pop catchy, rather, Yo La Tengo, Wilco catchy. Okay, the reason why I'm reviewing The National's Boxer is because I don't think it gets enough credit as it deserves.  If you want to hear good music from a band that doesn't care about anything but the music they play, listen to Boxer...or go see them in concert theyre on tour.  If you give them time and have a good taste in music you won't be disappointed.

B00005JPFH|5.0|Out of the Big Three in May of 2007 (which will forever be considered the biggest box-office showdown in history, composing of \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,\\" \\"Shrek the Third,\\" and Spider-man 3\\"), I was looking forward to \\"Spider-man 3\\" the most and wanted it to become the winner. I was and wasn't surprised when \\"At World's End\\" won. I was shocked because \\"Spider-man 3\\" had more going for it, mainly the fact that one of the most hyped Spidey villains (Venom) was in the film. I wasn't shocked because it was \\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" the previous film ended on a cliffhanger, and it had a secret weapon: Jack Sparrow. And though \\"Spider-man 3\\" did have some weaknesses and its share of disappointments, I still ended up loving it (though nothing compared to \\"Spider-man 2\\"). I'll get the bad stuff out of the way first:<br /><br />CAUTION: Some spoilers ahead<br /><br />1. Later on, it was revealed Venom (a fan favorite) was in the film, meaning all the Spider-man nerds would get their wish. I, of course, had no problem with it. My problem was that the villain was hyped to death, and he was only in the film for maybe fifteen minutes. I felt it wasn't fair of the filmmakers to let down the fanboys hoping for some sweet Venom action (although there are rumors of his return in future installments).<br /><br />2. Too much unnecessary comic relief. This is something the whole series suffers from on a grand scale, but it was very apparent in the third film. It rarely struck me as funny and came across as groan-inducing.<br /><br />3. The film was made out to be the darkest of the three, which I wanted. I expected the film to be very dark; I felt it would have benefitted the film more. Sadly, the trailers were off-putting again. \\"Spider-man 3\\" had an actually quite lightweight tone overall; I believe this hurt the film's previous reputation and hype in many ways. Sure, it had dark elements; but they could have spent more time developing those ideas and made them darker.<br /><br />4. Not enough action. \\"Spider-man 2\\" set the golden standard for comic-book action sequences, and I expected the third film to out-do it by a mile. Instead, the action scenes it had (while good) just (again) didn't meet the hype. The end battle with Venom and Sandman wasn't near as grand as it could've been. \\"Spider-man 3\\" was more of a drama film than an action film, and that was disappointing to an action fan like me.<br /><br />Enough bad stuff. Time for the goodies:<br /><br />1. The film stuck to the characters. No matter how much time is spent on them and their personal lives, I give lots of credit to director Sam Raimi for this. It gives us a reason to care for these characters and even the villains. On the human level the film succeeds mightily.<br /><br />2. The special effects were spetacular. We've come to expect this from nearly every major blockbuster, but the effects are almost always better in a \\"Spider-man\\" film. Though the particle effects on Sandman were at times unconvincing, overall the visuals were strong and believeable.<br /><br />3. Sandman. 'Nuff said.<br /><br />4. The film left me satisfied at the end, and gave me hope that in the years to come, we might see all of our beloved characters again. For any trilogy to accomplish that is a grand thing.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, regardless of the film's faults and missteps, I still think \\"Spider-man 3\\" is a grand-scale epic worthy of the name it's made for itself. Plus, it's a lot of fun to watch.

B0009A40ES|3.0|Christian Bale is a typical American Rich Snob in the 80s whose only focus is himself.  He is the predecessor of the metro sexual, with 4 kinds of body cleanser, perfectly pressed business clothing and a male physique to die-for. He has everthing and begins to lose his mind.<br /><br />The pinnacle of the movie is Christian Bale, absolutley naked as a jay-bird, muscles throbbing, covered in his victim's blood, wielding a chain-saw, screaming in some psycho-sexual rage as his victim gets away down a stair-well. He screams and throws the running chainsaw over the balcony to finish his victim off.<br /><br />You don't know whether you are turned on or terrifed.<br /><br />Everything begins to fall apart as his mind betrays him.  By the end, he doesnt know if he really did these things or if it was his sick fantasy.<br /><br />Another highlight is watching the intolerable character played by Jared Leto being butchered with an ax.<br /><br />Probably a great movie for its time but definitely has some sick themes, but just seeing Bale naked is worth it.  Batman buns....Yummy.
0441003257|4.0|One of the funniest starts to book, ever.  That is a good enough reason to read it.  As far as I am concerned, this is Gaiman's best prose work, I suppose that fact that he had such talented help on the comedy front might discount that somewhat, if you do not know who actually did what.  Anyway, this is often hilarious.
B0000020C4|5.0|If you are to buy one Les Miserables album, this is the one to have. With a cast that includes Phillip Quast, Colm Wilkinson, Ruthie Henshall, Michael Ball, Judy Kuhn, and Lea Salonga, it can do no wrong. Each of the actors is absolutely perfect for the role-exactly as I pictured them while reading the novel-EXCEPT Lea Salonga, who, ironically, gives the best performance of the whole cast.     I will admit that those who have complained that Lea is not suited for Eponine are correct: She is neither ugly nor does she have a terrible voice. The key word here is terrible. Yes, Eponine should not sound pretty. However, even I, a very strong novel purist, will say that I would rather have Lea Salonga bring tears to my eyes as Eponine than some other girl make me wince every time she opens her mouth for a song (Here, I refer to the Complete Symphonic Recording. Perfect Eponine, very painful to hear).     All I can say is get it. It is worth every penny.

B000JJRIN4|5.0|I didn't like any of the singles from Gwen's last album \\"Love.Angel.Music.Baby.\\" I thought they were meaningless and pointless.  But when I heard \\"The Sweet Escape\\" on the radio I knew she was back and I loved that song. I decided to check out her new album and I ended up liking every song from \\"Early Winter\\" to \\"Orange County Girl.\\"  Gwen worked with The Neptunes for several of the songs.  She also co-wrote all of the songs on the album which makes it even more personal for her.  Gwen is very talented and you can tell from listening to this album.  This is definately the best album from 2006 or at least my favorite from last year.  I listened to a lot of albums from last year and this is my favorite. It's pure ear candy.  Buy it, you won't be dissapointed!

B000QUCNP4|5.0|Zodiac is a surprising gripping film where the bad guy gets lucky and doesn't get caught in his lifetime. It is a study of the famous case of serial murders from the view of three obsessed individuals played by Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo and Jake Gyllenhaal. All put in superb performances. Downey is at his roguish best, while Ruffalo and Gyllenhaal team up together to carry the movie to its frustrating (but not entirely unsatisfactory) ending. Reality, unlike movies, often hands out \\"so close yet so far\\" moments. David Fincher adds his touches of dramatization and subtle humor to the story without over-simplifying the complexity and confusion that cloud the investigation. With wonderful music choices (love the soundtrack) and great attention to details, this movie is a nostalgic and suspenseful retelling of the legendary cold case.

B00005JLCI|4.0|Kenneth Branagh had one great life's ambition when he began his film career in 1981: to do a full-length (4 hour) version of Shakespeare's Hamlet. He started as an actor and then directed his first film, Henry V, in 1989, to rave reviews. It is still considered by most critics and audiences to be the best film version of a Shakespeare play ever produced. He was instantly established as a genius.<br /><br />In 1993, he directed his second successful Shakespeare adaptation, Much Ado About Nothing, again to both critical and popular acclaim. Along the way, he was doing some very interesting roles, including Guy Pringle in Fortunes Of War and both Roman Strauss and Mike Church in Dead Again.<br /><br />Then disaster hit. He decided to make an adaptation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and he decided to make it very macabre. His marriage to actress Emma Thompson was already strained, even though they had done a number of projects together. But with Frankenstein, they were apart a good bit of the time, and that seemed to be all that was needed to push them over the top and Branagh over the edge. They say there is a thin line between genius and madness, and I think Branagh crossed over that line during the production of Frankenstein. If you look at a list of his work, it is very dichotic, with noble, uplifting pieces like Henry V and Much Ado on one side, and darker, sinister ones like Dead Again and Frankenstein on the other. It is almost as if there were two Kenneth Branaghs.<br /><br />Frankenstein was a disaster critically, financially, and personally for Branagh. The following year, 1995, he and Emma divorced. That same year he produced Othello to decent reviews. The pendulum was trying to swing back. But Branagh was drunk with the lure of success. He was beginning to fancy himself as a sex symbol, a movie star and the successor to Lawrence Olivier. If he could fulfill his life's ambition and produce Hamlet, perhaps that would be the vehicle to boost his career and catapult his image to stardom.<br /><br />Branagh decided to make his 1996 production of Hamlet an anachronism. Rather than setting it in the Middle Ages, as Shakespeare intended, he chose the Napoleonic era, which corresponds with the Empire style in France and the Biedermeier style in Germany. Both influences are evident in the look of the film, which is overtly opulent. This goes at cross-purposes with the austerity of the play and its archaic themes. It also confuses the politics involved, such as England paying tribute to Denmark.<br /><br />Branagh echos the look and feel of the design with his performance. Instead of coming across as the melancholic Danish prince, he seems to be a pampered and bored aristocrat intent on playing games with the people in his life. There has never been an adequate explanation as to why Hamlet chose to play the madman in his uncle's court, since he was not in any danger. But Branagh seems to use Hamlet's madness as an excuse to give his usual over-the-top performance. His \\"madness\\" is merely a lack of discipline.<br /><br />Hamlet is extremely interesting because it shows, on the one hand, the beauty of Kenneth Branagh's genius, and, on the other, the excesses of his madness. There are some exceptional performances by the cast, though the casting is uneven. In order to hedge against possible audience rejection, he filled the cast with stars. Many of them are strange choices, like Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal. Others are genius, like Derek Jacobi as Claudius, Julie Cristie as Gertrude, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, Nicholas Farrell as Horatio and Charlton Heston as the Player King. Besides Jacobi, others from Branagh's regular company of performers include Brian Blessed as Hamlet's Ghost, Richard Briars as Polonius and Michael Maloney as Laertes.<br /><br />Like Frankenstein, Hamlet was a disaster, and I think the failure changed Branagh as a person. He lost a good bit of his cache in Hollywood as a result, although recently he has done productions of As You Like It, The Magic Flute and Sleuth. It looks like he's gone back to what he does best: light, fun, inspirational, funny, noble pieces. I hope he never returns to the macabre (Frankenstein) and the overblown (Hamlet). In his acting, he has had some forgettable roles, like those in Wild, Wild West and Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, but he's also had some good roles, like Shackleton, and even some great ones, like FDR in Warm Springs. I think he's pulled himself out of the hole he was in and is probably a much humbler and better man because of it.<br /><br />I got to meet and talk with Ken on the set of Warm Springs. He seems like a very genuine and likable person. My impression is that his obsession with himself and his career ended with Hamlet, and now he is free just to be himself and enjoy his work. But Hamlet remains as a monument to what can happen to a man when he becomes obsessed.<br /><br />To date, Lawrence Olivier's 1948 Hamlet is still the best performance of that classic role. Franco Zeffirelli's 1991 version starring Mel Gibson is still the best production. I would probably rate Branagh's work as third. I would give it four out of five stars.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithic Flute and Sleuth. It looks like he's gone back to what he does best: light, fun, inspirational, funny, noble pieces.

0345350499|3.0|A rather foggy version.   As far as Arthurian stories go, this one is definitely on the tedious end, and pretty hard to get through.  An actual case where I amazingly enough found a tv miniseries significantly more enjoyable.

B000J4QWM2|4.0|Barry Henley lacks the presence of Edward James Olmos, Gina doesn't have as big a role as the character did in the series, and I missed Izzy, but there's a lot to like for fans of the original \\"Vice\\" tv series. Director Michael Mann has updated for the new millennium with heavier weaponry, cool gadgets, and a better story than he could show on tv almost two decades later. Would have been nice if some original cast members could have had cameos or reprised their roles.<br /><br />Detectives Sonny and Rico are undercover (a la \\"Smuggler's Blues\\") to catch a drug kingpin and a leak from their side of the fence. Sonny gets in over his head with the beautiful dealer Isabella; Rico and Trudy (a couple in this screen version) deal with their relationship as lovers as well as fellow officers and Trudy's kidnapping by enemy bikers.<br /><br />The story itself is great, the production values of course exceed anything that could have been shown on tv in the 80s, and anybody who likes crime and suspense movies will be entertained by \\"Miami Vice.\\" Fans of the old series won't find much, if anything, to complain about.<br /><br />The updated \\"In The Air Tonight\\" on the way to the showdown was a nice touch that old fans will appreciate.
0451197968|3.0|A nasty dystopia that is definitely a little bit closer today.    A completely stratified society has the whole bread and circuses thing going, with all sorts of deadly reality tv type entertainments to keep people occupied.    A young man of the underclass has a very sick child, and in order to get money to make her well, decides to try and enter one of these game shows.    He ends up in the lethal Running Man game, that no-one has ever come out of alive, and has to find a way.
B000OQF6N6|2.0|Where the hell are James and D'arcy?  This isn't the Pumpkins at all... they didn't even bring back Melissa!<br /><br />The only reason Billy 'reunited' the Pumpkins is because he knew that he could attract crowds with playing the old hits from their success in the 90s.  Maybe you'll even be lucky enough to hear 'Today' or '1979' live!  I've never seen the Pumpkins live (I wished I had taken the chance I had during the Machina era) but quite honestly, after reading the bad reviews of shows, hearing this record, and the absence of 50% of the original lineup... I could care less!  Maybe if Billy wasn't such a pompous self-absorbed stuck up elitist and actually cared about mending the tarnished relationships of his former band-mates... this could have been a genuine reunion.<br /><br />I hadn't planned on writing a review for this album at all, but I figured I might as well and prepare for an angry onslaught from the superfans.  They did amazing work way back when... but Zeitgeist is a horrible and miserable attempt at a Pumpkins record.  If this were a Zwan record (cringe), fine.  But don't destroy the magic that the Pumpkins once had by putting out an album like this.  It's like... Jordan un-retiring himself.  You've proved your point, you've had your success... go out on a high note.
0575078022|4.0|Untruthful little Bastich has a surfeit of problems.    The major problem with this book is that it appears to be padded to get up to 'the length the editor wants', it seems.  This makes the start boring.  Like Jimmy the Hand in the Raymond Feist books, the main character is a smart, alone kid that falls in with thieves, and has a flair for being different.  However, rather than an interesting an entertaining introduction such as Fritz Leiber may have delivered, we get about four flashback incidents of what the kid does that is clever and lacking in common sense.  By that time, you are about ready to say 'hey, why don't I lie down and you can hit me with a hammer that will imprint in big neon letters on my forehead \\"Locke Lamora is a clever reckless brat\\".  Other than that, though, once the boring kid stuff is finally dispensed with many pages later, and kept a lot more brief later on the book is quite entertaining.  You have an urban Italian style setting, with no firearms and a carts/ships/crossbows level of tech, and the odd hint of fantasy as Locke as his fellow band of thieves look to lay in a long con.    This is shortcircuited by what is basically a gang war, and revenge plots, and draws in both the official and unofficial sides of the city into the bloodshed.  I didn't notice until almost finished as on the back in faint type is 'Book One of the..' but it says sequence, not trilogy, so given the ending, it may be a sequence of adventures, as opposed to a trilogy given that is how it is worded.  This would also explain some of the padding.  I would go so far as to call this one a 3.75, with the really slow start dragging it down from a 4, and an inventive faster moving end bringing it back up in that direction.

0618680004|1.0|Am not a religious person but Dawkins seems unable to let go of his childhood understanding and resentment of religious institutions and ideology. For someone so vociferously condemning of a particular subject, he seems to have no practical exposure to his subject matter nor does he seem willing to entertain any data that would refute his position. Sort of like the world getting behind Jane Goodall as the ultimate authority on chimps but having never been to Gombi or left her London home. His points of attack are truly weak (evolution, something that has been adopted by all major religions as fact.) and ridiculously hangs his hat on thing like that because science and our ability to understand our environment and existence in enormously complex detail is proof positive of the non-existence of God. This guy seems to have taken his philosophy from Star Trek (using the planets and beyond as refutation of a long dated and not really in-play middle ages anthro-centrist perspective. ) For most in the modern age, this is more a starting point in the evolution of their understanding of God and well incorporated by the aggregate. Like many in academia, Dawkins seems entranced and arrogantly lulled by a long refuted premise of aggregate understanding and likely guilty of chauvinistic ignorance of the great unwashed, and that his own reasoning is above reproach, motive or bias. You really have to call condemnation without investigation what it is, bigotry.  The fact that much of what he says has an appeal is proof positive that he is wrong in his assumptions ie. that religious institutions are much more secularized (in doctrine and in practice)than he asserts, that this has come through in its pedagogy over the generations from which he is now reaping the rewards in a back handed fashion.

B000PTYP5C|5.0|I purchased the special edition, with the DVD, which delivered a lot more than what I hoped for. It is over one hour in length, with many of the intricacies of the composing and production of the album. The most amazing part was in the section on the song \\"repentance\\" where Mike Portnoy invited some of his friends to contribute voice overlays expressing their own experiences of repentance and confession. I don't think there would have been any way to know that these are actual musicians coming together to connect at such an intimate level. Besides that, this album is definitely a progression in the development and maturity of the DT sound, which gets better and better with each album!! Where will it go from here?!

B000059XUO|4.0|I have viewed the The Crow when it was first release at the theater and later on two different formats VHS and laser Disc, both formats as good as there were at the time, don't come close as good as on DVD.  The colors were as close as you can get on the big screen (in a theater setting).   The Crow is formatted for 16X9 wide screen TVs which is must for those of you who don't have a wide screen television to enjoy the full color and dramatic impact this movie makes. Scenes with dark areas, stood out with clarity, even with scenes that had too much Red satuation were reduce to give a clearer picture.  DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 were a added bonus to a great movie as it was met to be heard. So have your volume crack up and enjoy the sound track that plays in the back ground, you won't be disappointed.

B000002J27|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - A Trick Of The Tail stands as the first post Gabriel album with now frontman Phil Collins, also earlier drummer, and as their talent without their main frontman was yet to be proven, Hackett, Collins, Banks and Rutherford showed their greatest proof of their real talent, as some of their main ideas may have been unseen with frontman leader Peter Gabriel, this is were true Genesis, the remaining Genesis, exploded their greatest effort and ability for showing everyone their true musical genious. A Trick Of The Tail is one of their greatest between all of Genesis eras because it doesn't assemble any type of frantic ambition or commercial approach, as they were only trying to demonstrate how great they are as musicians, and how each of them has a unique talent that can be equal to any of their previous efforts, even though the paradox was that this album was one of their earliest commercial success, but even though their increasing commercial aproach really started in their later Wind And Wuthering, wich is still a piece of art, but not as strong and symbolic as their Collins' era true masterpiece; A Trick Of The Tail.<br /><br />The album isn't defined as a concept album, but its still pictured in Great Britain later XVIII century, just as the album's mytic style and hugh atmosphere reveal the album's theme, but this is one of the things it bother me, as its better for them not to settle on an specific atmosphere to really demonstrate their intelectual talent. Anyway, the album assumes a fantastic, cerebral and good natured progressive rock, its compositions are still complex, intricate and acclaimed but its still a very comprehensible album, as they proof their greatest talent and real intentions, is the perfect album for casual listeners. The album's atmospheric beauty, stunning musical performance, key moments and complex but yet comprehensible style make it one of their greatest, most incredible and fantastic albums, its among one of my true favourites, as it was my favourite for a long time. The album's moods are atmospheric, cerebral, thematic, complex, good natured, theatrical, emotional and thoughtful.<br /><br />Within its songs, each of them keep a majestic beauty hardly seen in their other albums but they keep an intricate mood for the very pleasure of hearing them. As Collins true compositional talent was yet to be proven (or it was proven wrong) most of the songs' compositions stay in the hands of Banks and Rutherford, Hackett contributions were shown in certain songs, as well as the entire band, but the most beautiful thoughtful and delicate compositions are the ones that Banks composed. Almost each song of this album is one of my personal favourite, but still they are ones in which their best intentions are shown, as it starts in the second track, Entangled, which is one of their most thoughtful, delicate, and profound songs written by both Tony Banks and Steve Hackett, its mesmerazing drama is really worthy of acclaim, as its overwhelming poetic structure is shown, as it declines in the chorus for giving space to a more melodic style, or as the fantastic, beautiful Mad Man Moon, which is certainly the best song in the whole album, its profound and emotional moods but yet comprehensible and enjoyable mellodies make it an incredible song, as well as the catchy, enjoyable, light, uncompromising but undertaking title track, A Trick Of The Tail, which is one of their most original songs with a moody structure, its one of their greatest, but finally it comes Los Endos, a fast paced instrumental wich recalls the previous song Dance On A Volcano, Squonk and A Trick Of The Tail, it even contains Collins singing a line from Supper's Ready, and its one of their best instrumentals, at least in the Collins era. The rest of the songs are also excellent and most delicate compositions, like the opening Dance On A Volcano, wich is a lighter song but still a fantastic one, wich starts with a soft inclinnation, later getting louder and more progressive, until the final part where Banks' explodes his keyboards performance, and later the third song, Squonk, is the most hard rocking song in the album, as it possesses a mythic atmosphere refering to a mythic animal named Squonk, who is a very shy, scared animal who cries almost every time. Robbery, Assault And Battery is a catchy, recognizeable and famous song refering to a robbery, and next to it comes Ripples, which is a very beautiful and melodic song. Track pick: Entangled, Mad Man Moon, A Trick Of The Tail, Los Endos.<br /><br />This is one of their greatest and most acclaimed albums of all time, a beautiful and thoughtful release without commercial intentions, so yet is one of the best albums for casual listeners and a delight for we fans.der and more progressive, until the final part where Banks' explodes his keyboards performance, and later the third song, Squonk, is the most hard rocking song in the album, as it possesses a mythic atmosphere refering to a mythic animal named Squonk, who is a very shy, scared animal who cries almost every time.

B00005JNS0|5.0|This is Pixar's best film to date (2007).  You may find yourself scratching your head in confusion because I say it is Paxiar's best to date as it has not received amazing critical reviews, Saying it is Pixar's best to-date  would mean it is better than the &#34;Toy Story&#34; films and &#34;Finding Nemo&#34;.  The reason this claim has been made is because although &#34;Toy Story&#34; and &#34;Finding Nemo&#34; were amazing, &#34;Cars&#34; succeeds in a few ways that those movies do not.<br /><br />  This movie has an extremely simple premise; a race car with the name &#34;Lightning McQueen&#34; (voiced by Owen Wilson&#34; is living life in the &#34;fast lane&#34;.  He is letting life pass him by so that he can be the youngest car to ever win a Piston Cup.  He is on the brink of winning it when by accident he winds up in a redneck town called &#34;Radiator Springs&#34;.  The town appears to have frozen in time, and after Mcqueen tears the roads to shreds he is sentenced to community service, and well, these simple minded people of course teach him the lessons about life he has failed to learn up to that point.<br /><br />  The story on paper sounds mundane, but it is the visuals that are stunning (even by Pixar's standards) and the fun characters (which for an animated film have surprising depth) that bring this tale to life.  What makes this movie so good is that it will touch your heart, and remind you that there is more to life than trying to succeed, and that sometimes slowing down and just taking a drive to look at the scenery is a more satisfying than winning another trophy. It is the kind of movie that children and adults alike can enjoy. It has funny and animated (animated personality that is) characters for children like &#34;Tow Mater&#34; (Voiced to perfection by Larry the Cable Guy), and more serious characters like &#34;Doc&#34; that is embittered, and sober-minded.<br /><br />  While most of these characters or characters like them are in other Pixar movies, that are just not as well fleshed out as they are here.  The bare bones narrative, simplistic story, and relaxed pace of Radiator Springs, and limited cast of characters, truly allow the characters to breath and come to life in a way even other Pixar films have not up to this date (2007) because the action takes a back seat here and this is truly a character study film, a rarity for a child oriented animated film.  The characters are the true backbone of the story, this proves true  because despite its slow pace, children love this movie.<br /><br />  Even if we cannot agree with me it being Pixar's best film as of 2007, we can agree that the visuals here are so amazing that you will often forget you are watching a &#34;cartoon&#34;.  The Route 66 setting is a visually rich environment, and the animators take great care to show those visual.<br /><br />  It is because of those qualities, and despite what critics say, this is a film that will age well because of its timeless themes, and will stand the test of time fifty years down the road, and will be considered a great classic as well as a milestone in computer animation.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyell fleshed out as they are here.

0553573403|1.0|I started this book, the beginning of what appeared to be the start of a huge fantasy epic (much like Robert Jordan) with some interest, because I had enjoyed some other Martin projects.<br /><br />To be interested, or stay interested in such a project I would have had to have found some interest in the characters.  No such luck.  This might work in one short book, but not in this 'might not ever even be finished at this rate' story.<br /><br />Very disappointing.  The writing is ok, just lots of points off for no-one and no plot of interest, or at least one that I couldn't have gotten from a garden variety historical novel set in this sort of milieu.

That was the beauty of the movie. It broke the usual format. It was so much fun! The combination of everything together was the very essence of this movie.  Now without the fake ads, ect. it won't be the roller coaster ride that it was in the theater. This is a TRAVESTY! I'll look for a bootleg of the original!  QT and RR are usually excellent but this is ridiculous. Yeah it bombed at the box office but that is because it was too cool for the average idiot!

B000NVIXFK|4.0|I've been a fan of Rush since Fly By Night and with Rush some songs reach out to me right away while some I never totally warm up to. I agree with some of the other reviewers that \\"Far Cry\\" sounds like it's been worked over to be more suitable for radio (although the Internet and satellite has pretty much made analog radio almost irrelevant to popular culture), and it does sound too edited. \\"Armor And Sword\\" and \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" rock out in the best Rush tradition. \\"The Larger Bowl\\" is melancholy in a way I haven't heard since \\"Losin' It\\" on Signals; maybe it's not cheery but melancholy has a way of intruding into life. \\"Spindrift\\" took me several listenings to catch everything going on, but once I did I really came to appreciate how it works on so many levels- from the fury of a strong windstorm along the coast or in the desert, or the fury of an angry lover. So far it's my favorite track on the album. Yes, \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" isn't the absolute best instrumental Rush has ever done but in my view it's among the better ones. \\"The Way The Wind Blows,\\" \\"Faithless,\\" \\"Bravest Face,\\" and \\"Good News First\\" sound almost contrived and out of place musically; even though I feel Peart was writing about issues which he really cares about the music could have been catchier in order to get more people to listen. \\"Hope\\" is a good acoustic guitar solo which does have an uplifting tempo and sound, and it's a nice piece. \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" is definitely a worthy instrumental, and \\"We Hold On\\" is a good ending track- overall, one of the better tracks on this album. To sum up, if you're either a longtime Rush fan, or you like what they did in the 90s, this album is definitely worth buying, but if you need a \\"Caress of Steel\\" or \\"Hold Your Fire\\" remake this isn't the album for you.
078625968X|5.0|An intelligent sports book, a bit of a rare thing oftentimes.    It takes a look at a team with less money trying to find ways to get the most out of what they have.  This involved an executive looking to do things differently and an assistant with some statistical acumen, and willingness to research.    Basically, they find out that drafting young teenagers is silly, drafting grown men with proven skills from college or other leagues makes more sense, and that a lot of drafting is handled in an amateur fashion.    It gives some player examples, but basically he found that defensive ability and speed was overvalued, so went looking for hitting and strikes.
038572179X|5.0|\\"Atonement\\" is divided into three parts, set during the period 1935-1940, with a brief epilogue set in the present day. The first, and longest, part is set during a stiflingly hot weekend in the summer of 1935. (By an odd coincidence, the last novel I read, Alison Lurie's \\"Only Children\\", also takes place during a hot summer weekend in the same year). The setting is a late Victorian stately home in Surrey, home to the wealthy Tallis family.     The three central characters in the drama are the family's younger daughter Briony (thus spelled), her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood friend. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the Tallis family's servants), but is academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated at the local grammar school and at Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seems to await him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he has set his heart on pursuing a career in medicine.     Most of the first part of the novel reads like an upper-class comedy of manners. Briony, a precocious thirteen-year-old with ambitions to be a writer, has written a play to be performed by herself and her three cousins, but this project proves abortive due to disagreements between them. Her mother, Emily, has retired to bed with a migraine. Robbie has fallen in love with Cecilia and, by accident, sends her a sexually explicit love-letter. In other circumstances this might have resulted in his disgrace, but as Cecilia returns his passion the accident seems to have been a happy one. The tone of the book changes abruptly, however, when Briony's fifteen-year-old cousin Lola is sexually assaulted. Lola cannot identify her assailant, but Briony, who was a witness to the incident, falsely accuses Robbie. As a result, he is convicted of attempted rape and sent to prison.     The second part is set in 1940 and contains the most powerful writing in the book. Robbie, released from jail, isnow a soldier with the British Army in northern France, desperately trying to reach Dunkirk ahead of the advancing Germans. What keeps him going is not fighting spirit, or patriotism, but the hope that he will be able to return to Cecilia, who has stood by him throughout his trial and imprisonment and has become estranged from her family as a result. What is remarkable is not merely Ian McEwan's powers to describe physical scenes but also the way he is able to conjure up the mood of those like Robbie caught up in the retreat, the terror, desperation and confusion of the defeated army, the blind panic and rage of the soldiers looking for anyone to blame for their plight. (At one stage an airman is nearly beaten to death by British soldiers in revenge for what they see as the RAF's failure to take on the Luftwaffe). Like another reviewer, I felt that these battle scenes were in the same class as Sebastian Faulks's brilliant descriptions of the Battle of the Somme in \\"Birdsong\\"; they should be required reading for those Britons who still insist on talking about the \\"miracle of Dunkirk\\" and on regarding it as a British victory rather than a defeat.     In the third part of the novel we see Briony, now eighteen, as a volunteer nurse in a London hospital. It is in this section that the theme of atonement, from which the novel takes its name, comes to the fore. Briony is starting to have doubts about her identification of Robbie as Lola's attacker, so much so that she offers to withdraw her previous testimony and help Robbie to clear his name. Her decision to work as a nurse rather than take up a place at university and to devote herself to caring for the wounded (and this part also contains some harrowing descriptions of suffering) can also be seen as an attempt to atone for the part she played in blighting the life of an innocent man and in tearing her family apart.      A key passage comes when McEwan is describing the eighteen-year-old Briony's literary ambitions. Sheis a fierce advocate of literary modernism, particularly the \\"stream-of-consciousness\\" school of writing associated with Virginia Woolf, and considers that it is no more possible for a modern novelist to write a \\"traditional\\" novel based around plots and characters than it is for a modern composer to write a symphony in the style of Mozart. The first 350 pages of the novel appear to be McEwan's own attempt to refute this viewpoint by putting it into the mouth of a character in a novel written in a very traditional manner.          If McEwan had finished his novel at the end of part three, it could still be read as a complete (and very good) work in its own right, although there are a few puzzling discrepancies. In Part One, for example, we are led to think that Briony, led astray by an over-active imagination, genuinely believes that Robbie is Lola's attacker, but in Part Three it would appear that she knows that this is not true and that, moreover, she actually knows the man's true identity. What McEwan actually does is to end the novel with a brief epilogue which turns on its head everything which has gone before. This epilogue is set in 1999 and is narrated by the seventy-seven year-old Briony, now a successful novelist looking back at her career and at the events of so many years before. The preceding 350 pages are revealed as Briony's final novel, one based upon certain true events in which she played a part as a teenager but in which she has taken certain liberties with the truth. These might in themselves be seen as Briony's last attempt to atone for her youthful misdeeds.         This revelation reverses the way in which we see \\"Atonement\\", and in my view is what makes it a brilliant five-star novel rather than a good four-star one. We suddenly see it, not as a piece of literary traditionalism with plot, characters and omniscient, godlike narrator, but rather as a piece of post-modernism whose partial and fallible narrator is herself a fictional character, not to be equated with the writer himself. This gives the book a double meaning. On the one hand, it is a traditional novel exploring such matters as sex, war and the class system. On the other, it is an experimental novel exploring the nature of truth and reality.

1594489505|5.0|I've just finished reading this book by the author of The Kite Runner.  This is Khaled Hosseini's second novel, and it's jam-packed with so much intrigue that I must rate it as the best book I've read in several years.  Two Afghanistan girls' lives intermingle as they come of age to marry at age 15 during the 30-year period of Soviet occupation, the Taliban, and post-Taliban.  Amidst personal struggles and political violence, these women grow in strength...and love.  A book that is #1 on the NY Times Bestseller List is not always an indicator of greatness to me, but in this case it truly is!
0553260111|5.0|Ludlum's 11th novel is clearly his greatest.  The story of Jason Bourne is told with white hot intensity.  A man with amnesia washes up on a beach, is cared for, and when recovered enough, goes looking to find out who he is.    It is a complicated thrill ride, and his own former agency, and the assassin Carlos the Jackal are out to get him.  He picks up a woman along the way as an unwitting accomplice as he fights to stay alive, as he fights to recover his memory, and the truth, and why he keeps remembering mnemonics for the early letters in the alphabet.

1400063515|5.0|In some ways, I find this book is poorly indexed as \\"Uncertainty (information theory)\\" or \\"Forecasting\\". More importantly, this book is an autobiography of someone who has clearly spent a lot of time being exposed to risk, and has interesting observations to make on how he handles that.<br /><br />Taleb is criticized (unfairly, perhaps) for the inclusion of fictional examples and for \\"taking on\\" the establishment enshrined in many Nobel prizewinners. However, he's not interested in coming up with a sophisticated \\"theory of everything\\" and is very mixed in his emotions about whether \\"black swans\\" are a good or a bad thing. In some ways, he feels that he has his own answers as to when a black swan is a good or a bad thing, but leaves it to the reader to learn from the tales in the book and the tale of his life. The reader must then apply the knowledge, and to learn how to not be a \\"sucker\\", a person who is going to be victimized by the occurrence of black swans, and the book admits there are likely many paths to either suckerdom or success.<br /><br />Whether you ultimately agree or disagree with the theories and suggestions of the book, this will be a fun book to read. His narrative style is engaging, and there are a multitude of small stories and interesting concepts and name-dropped characters for you to fill your imagination. He's more concerned about the ride than the destination, and even though he is constantly \\"getting there\\", making points as he goes and draws to a brilliant conclusion, you don't feel as though you've had to endure the ride to get there. It's not about nail-biting, hair-rasing uncertainty, but about looking at life as an adventure, where you accept big losses by making small bets, and collect as many free rides as you can in the process without feeling you have to bet the entire farm on just one big thrill. Unless you want to.<br /><br />This is a careful, brilliantly humanistic book- it does not resort to moralizing nor feels the need to attack those who moralize either. Its enemy is the \\"ludic fallacy\\"- the tendency of \\"nerds\\" to mistake the simulation, the game, for the real thing, the map for the territory. It's a reminder to live life, and is endlessly upbeat despite having full awareness of the fragility and improbability of happiness.<br /><br />That said, it is not devoid of philosophical sophistication. He does not reject science, mathematics: he is reminding you not to be fooled by overly precise models. If there is any weakness, it is that his mathematical models that he gives as examples sometimes seem to easily drawn, \\"straw men\\" to his argument. Nonetheless, it's not about what is right, per se, but about what works. In some ways, that it has worked for him is a black swan in and of itself, and this book is entirely humble, self-aware of that fact.<br /><br />As long as you are willing to accept that, I feel this book is entirely a worthwhile read and an important addition to any library. The book is well referenced and topics are readily found, for when you forget and want to recall Sextus whats-his-name and need a quick place to look before digging for more information. As such, it is a handy nexus book for a more deep delve into the world of philosophy, without haughtily deigning itself to be an encyclopedia of philosophy.

B000002HRE|4.0|Metallica continues to prove it has staying power no matter how long angry 'old school' metalheads hold a grudge.  Their slick, melody driven 'Black' album demonstrated Metallica's influences go well beyond the late 70s British progressive metal.      This trend has continued with the release of Load and the second installment, Reload.  Load featured heavy riffs, melodic vocal performances, stylized, thoughtful soloing and introspective lyrics.      While Reload is more of the same, it is an even better effort.  A few reviews complain about the lyrics, but I don't see the problem.  'Fuel' should be the anthem of any wrench cranking autophile.  From there, James becomes introspective and at times, thoughtful.  Carpe Diem Baby includes the great line, '...then make me miss you!'     The riffing on this disc is even better than Load.  From the opening riff of Bad Seed to the note bending closer, Fixxxer, the guitar playing is soulful and gritty.  Kirk continues to play more controlled, richly textured leads.  Gone are the finger cramping leads of the early records.  This is more reflective of 70s gunslingers like Eric Bloom and Scott Gorem.  And it is a welcome change.      This disc also adds some new twists.  I don't know who invited in Marianne Faithfull, but it was a bold move.  Her creepy, throaty voice lends perfectly to The Memory Remains' lasting melody line (check out Faithfull's brilliant Broken English record).  The Unforgiven II is a fantastic second installment to one of the best songs on the Black album.      And then there is the Midwest meets Southern rock ode, Low Man's Lyric.  James vocal range is tested here and it passes with flying colors.  The riff could have easily been played on the Lynard Skynard tour bus or belted out by Bob Seger during a Des Moines, Iowa rehearsal.      Unfortunately, Metallica bent to the will of their people, releasing a good, but not great, follow up, St. Anger.  I have a feeling their anticipated follow up will be similar.  I hope they come around.  What the rock n roll world needs is more albums like Reload and less complaining metalheads.

1594489505|5.0|The minute I started reading A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS, I was captivated and only wanted to read more.  Yet the more I read, the more uneasy and distressed I became.  As a woman, I was at once repulsed and pained by the events and experiences of these women's lives--especially so since I knew Hosseini's story was inspired significantly by true-life experiences.  Every night, I picked up the book again with both piqued interest and hesitation--did I really want to subject myself to these desperate lives again?  But the power of the book prevailed.  I viewed each page not as a novel but as an education into a culture into which I was fortunate enough not to have been born.  The writing is fluid and concise, so effectively capturing the culture and places that it describes.  Weeks later, I still reflect back on this book and feel sorrow and empathy for the women of Afghanistan and those caught up in the persistent wars.  I appreciate the insights I have gained and feel ever more connected to the struggles of so many kinds occurring in that region of the world. This is a novel about perseverance, determination and hope (I don't go quite as far as to say optimism) in the face of great hardship and injustice.  It is so difficult to find a basis for optimism in the changing state of affairs in that region.  This book attempts to plant that seed, but its germination for me is snuffed out by real life reports from those fronts.  The prospects are indeed glum.

No matter where she goes the voice I have come to appreciate is sure to folow. I look forward to her future efforts and the variety that will be sure to follow.
0790737345|4.0|For you Meg Ryan fans [10 years ago], this may well be the best performance of her career. She is utterly believable as a young heart surgeon who falls in love with a haunting Nicholas Cage [her angel]. I found Cage's performance strong [because he is a strong actor], but in this case, not strong enough to maintain my suspension of disbelief. The script is a little heavy-handed on the metaphors, like Ryan's \\"heart surgeon\\" role, and the fact that angels must literally \\"fall\\" out of their protective, celestial perches in order to experience what humans feel when they \\"fall in love.\\" I dunno. Maybe thse are minor points, but they seemed a tad hokey to me. What happens as we follow the foibles of Nick's coming to terms with human frailty - as well as the conclusion - are also a little predictable. I did, however, love Dennis Franz's performance as a fallen angel who learned to accept - and adapt to - his new role as a human being. He brought some much-needed levity to a script that might have otherwise found itself drowning in self-indulgence. In the end, this is a film about true love, and about how much we're willing to give - or let go of - in order to feel it in the first place. In a world where everything is over-analyzed, and caution is at an all-time high, it was a welcomed relief to visit this over-the-top look at romantic love one last time...before we forget it ever existed. Maybe that's why I gave it 4 stars.

B0001I55OC|1.0|I like good sci-fi movies such as Gattaca and Existenz  and historical dramas, even if they  bend the facts of history a little  such as the HBO  TV Rome series, so I was looking forward to entertainment. I would have been better off, however, watching the nine o'clock  news on TV last Sunday. Ten minutes into the movie I knew it was a dud. I stuck it out to the bitter end. I felt that the highlight was the siege effects in the last half an hour despite the French knight toting a shield bearing the arms of Canada's Quebec La Belle Province, founded many centuries later!  The acting was appalling and very hammy. Did any of these \\"actors\\"  actually graduate from Acting Academy? I have seen better drama and less emoting in junior school stage productions. There is also the problem of a very thin story line. Time travellers get stuck in a wormhole, others sent to extract them  and nearly get stuck too about sums it up. Plenty of  historical flaws (1357 was one year after the  battle of Poitiers in which the French king and many  of his  nobles were captured and detained in London until the Treaty of Bretigny of  1360. It was in the middle of  a very  bad period for France and the English  certainly didn't have their  backs to the  wall then ). Historical distortion  would have been acceptable  with a good cast and strong story line to support the  techically good and seemingly highly expensive production, although in daylight the setting looked a bit like a castle in a theme park. I'm glad  my copy was  a 50 euro cents DVD \\"giveaway\\" with the Sunday newspaper. Had I spent  nearly $10 on it I would have  wanted my money back.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|The four stars are for the #1 compilation itself, not a rating of The Beatles' music on the disc, nearly all of which is obviously genuine \\"5 Star\\" material! So, with over a thousand reviews here at the time of writing, why yet another? Because it needs to be pointed out that this is not a complete \\"Best Of\\" compilation nor a fair cross section of what the Beatles were musically capable, and that popularity (ie.sales) should not be a validation of worth. One thing that can be said with certainty is: A top numerical position on the charts does not necessarily mean that a compilation of these number ones is the definitive best of the Beatles. We DO get rollicking rockers such as \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", \\"I Feel Fine\\", \\"Lady Madonna\\", and \\"Get Back\\" as well as the beloved ballads \\"Yesterday\\", \\"Hey Jude\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Something\\", both categories proving the band mastered those styles, but what about the superb in-between music played regularly by progressive radio stations everywhere and represented by the 'Rock Beatles': \\"Revolution\\", \\"Rain\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and psychedelic-era Beatles tracks - \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", \\"Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds\\", \\"I Am the Walrus\\", \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\"? The answer is: Of course they're not here because they weren't #1 charting songs. (Though the non-#1 \\"Penny Lane\\" mysteriously IS, while \\"Please Please Me\\", a true Number One in many countries, is NOT.) If you want to enjoy the full glory of the Beatles' music and understand them more, you need these latter tracks...Still, #1 is a more sensible collection than the earlier ill-conceived LOVE SONGS and ROCK & ROLL compilations, but not as honest as the vinyl-only GREATEST HITS or import-only vinyl LIVERPOOL BOX. The BEATLES 1 set has other strengths, such as the beautiful and generous color booklet and fine remastered sound. Four-and-half stars: Slightly skewed selection but otherwise good value.

0812550706|5.0|The book Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, was a fabulous piece of work.  In the story aliens have invaded planet Earth and then retreated.  The world has united in trying to fight the enemy.  They are training young gifted children in the ways of military strategy.  The story takes place on a training ship in outer space.  For training, the children must learn to battle each other in a simulation room, these are called games.  Ender Wiggins, the main character, is the smallest and youngest of the recruits.  He must fight his way through battle school and overcome many obstacles to prove that he is the best.     Orson Scott Card was born on August 24, 1951 in the state of Washington.  He won the Hugo award and the Nebula award in consecutive years, making him the first author to ever do that.  He won those awards with Ender's Game and its sequel, Speaker for the Dead. Currently Card is a professor of writing and literature at Southern Virginia University.  He is also still writing books.     The end of the story had an unbelievable twist that would catch any reader off guard.  The book deals with moral issues that every one struggles with.  Card is able to use children to set an example to everyone.  The way the children ban together to triumph over the challenges is inspiring.  He also deals with issues of compassion, mercy, and the greater good.  Also, throughout the story the reader gains an excellent understanding of all the characters because their development is very expressive.  Battle school not only teaches the children about war but it makes them grow up very fast.       Overall the book was a joy to read.  The action was intense and the dialogue was intriguing.  Although there were dull moments they were few and far between.  The dull moments come during training periods when everything seems routine.  However, these dull moments do not last long and are generally followed by intense action.     This book is a great read for young adults and adult readers.  Some parts may be too violent or frightening for younger readers.  There are two sets of books that follow Ender's Game.  The Ender Series which follows Ender's life after this book and the Shadow Series which follows a character Ender meets at Battle School.  Both series are excellent reads after Ender's Game.

0553106635|5.0|It is incredibly difficult to put into words how you feel after reading George RR Martin's work.  There are many before me who have written extensive reviews of the books in A Song of Ice and Fire and I feel there is little I could really add or detract from any of them.  To put it simply, if you are a fan of fantasy, and I mean from a casual reader who picks up a novel every couple of years or a die-hard fanatic, Martin's books are worth their weight in gold.  The story is incredibly rich with detail, history, action and most importantly, intrigue.  It is not written in the epic nature of the Lord of the Rings but challenges Tolkien's great work by instead offering a reader a world of fantasy that is startling similar to our own.  Martin's realism, proven by his extensive historical research and adept knowledge of human nature, is what raises these books toward becoming classics.  Like any other fan of the books, I can't say enough how much you should read them.  Do not feel intimidated by their size as you will quickly move through the books once you are entrapped in the stirring stories.  Go buy this and the other books.    Hopefully Martin will finish the series within the next ten years...
0316067598|5.0|Excellent recount and description of the tragic and heroic events in Afghanistan.  Heros indeed. Well-written and interesting build-up to actual true account -- the SEAL training and actions in Iraq were very informative and meaningful to the story. A little too religious at times, and repetative, but it lends to the personal account of the author and \\"Lone Survivor.\\".  It will make a dynamic movie one day.
B00005JPLW|5.0|For any fan of the movie 300, this is the the DVD version to buy (that is if you don't have HD).  The picture is crisp and the art is as stunning as the movie appeared in theaters.  Sound also translates well to the dvd.  The extras, however, are what raises this dvd to a must-buy.  In depth interviews with the director, cast, author (Frank Miller) and most importantly, historians.  It is refreshing to see that the creators of the film clearly state that this work is not meant to be a historical presentation but a mythological one, an explanation that is well-clarified by the historians interviewed.  I could go on about the additional content concerning costume design, training, the soundtrack and the aesthetic visuals but that would ruin what awaits you on the dvd.  If you enjoyed 300 for what it was, a mythological re-telling of one of history's pivotal moments, then you should get this dvd.
0743289684|5.0|As Americans, we often don't get to see what life is like for those born under different circumstances. Conversely, folks born in other cultures often see Americans as decadent and self-absorbed. That neither side really understands the other's position creates a cultural divide that few dare to cross. Ms. Ali is one of very few people with a mind open enough to cross that divide, and at perilous expense to her own well-being.    Reading her book I was taken into the world of Islam. I could see the sense of family and purpose that drives the Muslim thought process. The societal norms of her culture are structured in such a fashion to maintain that culture and all its habits, good and bad. Western culture is seen as the makings of the infidel and avoidance of it's trappings is seen as the goal of any good Muslim. After all, who would want to allow their children to fall into the decadent lifestyle as seen in western countries. Islam offers a solution to such a dilemma, but it comes with a high price. Submission to Islam carries with it a very narrow social context to which it's believers must adhere. This is especially incumbent upon Muslim women who suffer many indignities as second class citizens of this culture.    The crux of her life crisis comes when she is betrothed in an arranged marriage to a Muslim man she does not care for. Ms. Ali must choose to remain a good Muslim and travel to Canada to be with this 'husband' or to make a break and seek refuge in a western country that will grant her refugee status. One must consider the huge risk she undertook in leaving Islam. As she learns the ways of western civilization, she comes to realize precisely what her Muslim culture didn't understand. That secular governments can provide services to its people in a humane and efficient way. When a Dutch policeman offers her help and doesn't expect a bribe in return, she is grateful and amazed. This would never happen in her Muslim culture.    Eventually she becomes a spokesperson for Muslim women and, with the help of an associate, produces a short film titled 'Submission' that exposes the inner-world of Islamic subcultures in western society. Her associate is then brutally murdered by a Muslim extremist who pins a note to his chest with a knife. The note threatens Ms. Ali for her work in exposing Islam. She goes into hiding but remains steadfast in her actions to put an end to Islamic persecution of women.    Once I started, I could not put this book down. Her story is simple yet so provocative. A Muslim women daring to abandon her culture with all the possibilities for retribution. Then to defiantly expose Islam and face the wrath of its' extremists. That her story corroborates another book I read, [[ASIN:0767920058 While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam is Destroying the West from Within]], tells me that there isn't just a grain of truth to either story. Their conclusions are even similar in that they both call for the assimilation of Muslims into western culture rather than allowing them to be 'outside-of-the-law' in their adopted western countries. A very interesting read with an important message for our world. Five stars without a doubt.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|Who said classic rock was dead or could not be redone in an innovative but respectfully retro way? I've probably heard too much Led Zeppelin in my time, but it's futile to listen to Wolfmother and deny that the rocking threesome possess an updated Zeppelin sound -- certainly not a negative observation. Andrew Stockdale, singer and guitarist, owns some wailing, high-pitched pipes that can only be compared to Robert Plant. Much of \\"Wolfmother\\" is comprised of gigantic, fluidly repetitive riffs in the mold of Jimmy Page in his prime -- and the solos ain't bad either. The loud drums and crashing cymbals are Zeppelin personified, and the slightly muted production of the CD comes off like an analog recording, which gives it an even more retro feel. Further, the ultra-mystical lyrics and the darkly conceptualized Dungeons and Dragons artwork in the CD booklet by Frank Frazetta make Wolfmother seem like it hails from a previous era of rock `n' roll. The added keyboard work by bass guitarist Chris Ross lends these songs even more transfixing atmosphere.<br /><br />The CD \\"Wolfmother\\" is guitar-heavy and proud, a wailing heavy metal forest of stomping anthem rockers that don't take long to absorb. The first track, \\"Dimension,\\" boasts the same type of fun and groovin' guitar riff that Lenny Kravitz was able to capture on the song \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\" (from the 1993 album of the same name). Though it has a heavier sound than Kravitz' tune, the take-a-ride-back-in-time aura on \\"Dimension\\" is similar. \\"White Unicorn,\\" with its more earnest tone, gorgeously chiming riff and killer vocals is even better. \\"Woman\\" was released as a single and deservedly so; the vocals ARE Robert Plant, and the crashing guitar and accompanying keyboards midway through are headbanging material at its finest. \\"Love Train\\" is also Zeppelin reincarnated, with its groovy riff, seductive solo and danceable, surprisingly funky sound.<br /><br />More modern comparisons also apply. \\"Apple Tree\\" reminds me a bit of a heavier White Stripes, especially the vocals; the last song, \\"Vagabond,\\" is reminiscent of Kula Shaker, a great band that started in the 1990s. Other songs and sounds of note include the colossal riff on \\"Colossal,\\" the slow-to-build \\"Mind's Eye,\\" the pitch-perfect guitar work on \\"Pyramid\\" and the cool \\"Witchcraft\\" and \\"Tales.\\" Overall, there's not one bad or dull song on the entire disc.<br /><br />With their trippy lyrics, larger-than-life guitar work and a heavily retro sound, these guys obviously have loads of respect for the genre they perform in, which makes it easy to respect Wolfmother.of a heavier White Stripes, especially the vocals; the last song, \\"Vagabond,\\" is reminiscent of Kula Shaker, a great band that started in the 1990s.

0618680004|3.0|At times this book is a fascinating read but overall it is vastly disappointing. The problem lies in the fact that despite his fierce protests about the illogical behavior of religious fanatics Dawkins is equally rash. Sadly, phrases like '...is an interesting theory but one I won't get into now' make far too many appearances. He seems content, like his opponents, to consider only those theories which support his cause and only those studies which prove his point (no matter how speculative they may be). Perhaps the subject is best left to those without an answer, those who can truly be objective. Dawkins most interesting chapter is the last, where he leaves God behind and gazes at the wonder of science. Perhaps God is another of Schoedinger's cats. He both exists and doesn't and we only discover which when we lift the box. Or end up in one.
0553801546|5.0|\\"The Tawny Man:  Fool's Fate\\" concludes \\"The Tawny Man Trilogy\\" as FitzChivalry Farseer, in the guise of Tom Badgerlock, quests with Prince Dutiful and others to obtain the head of Icefyre for the Prince's Out Island bride-to-be Narcheska Elliania.  The author beautifully mixes emotions with character and environment descriptions to finish a fantastic realm that started with \\"The Farseer Trilogy\\" and \\"The Liveship Traders Trilogy\\".<br /><br />The Skill is cleverly applied in the final novel of the storyline.  Fitz utilizes the Skill competently, a talent he has been lacking throughout the series, and because of Nighteyes' absence the Wit becomes his secondary ability.  Nettle and Thick display the cleverest and most unique talents.  Prince Dutiful asserts himself and develops well as a leader as Chade's aggressive nature pushes the limit of all their abilities.<br /><br />Burrich's appearance helps blend the past with the present.  Chade's changed a lot since \\"[[ASIN:055357339X The Farseer:  Assassin's Apprentice]]\\" with his lively and outgoing behavior however remains the same in his machinations.  There could be an entirely new history concerning the Black Man on the island of Aslevjal, one I would be interested in reading.  Fitz's most wonderful work though connects his affection with the Fool.  Sadly the series ends after becoming attached with many wonderful characters.<br /><br />After all the buildup and delay from the original series, I was disappointed with the outcome of the Rooster Crown.  Jinna and her Hedge-Witch magic are pretty much neglected.  A more detailed map of the significant terrains and comprehensive appendix would have been useful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00004T9VY|5.0|Cat Stevens scored a major goal with this blockbuster album entitled Tea For The Tillerman. Cat's voice is in excellent form and the musical arrangements reflect forethought.<br /><br />The track set begins with the classic \\"Where Do The Children Play?\\" The song begins with some great guitar playing; and this song gives Cat the chance to lament that \\"progress\\" has taken away green grassy fields and playgrounds where children used to play. Cat explores his pain over the downside of progress. \\"Hard Headed Woman\\" has Cat singing passionately of his desire to find his one true love; the chord changes make the musical arrangement very strong and poignant. The percussion also enhances the musical arrangement.<br /><br />\\"Wild World\\" is clearly a highlight of this album; Cat's character sings of his pain at losing his lover; and he warns her of how the new people she will meet will be able to hurt her terribly. \\"Sad Lisa\\" changes the scenario; now the woman has been hurt and Cat sings of how he wants to comfort her and love her. \\"Sad Lisa\\" sports a great arrangement for the piano and strings to make \\"Sad Lisa\\" a tender, sensitive love ballad.<br /><br />\\"But I Might Die Tonight\\" explores the angst people experience when they have an unfulfilling life; and \\"Into White\\" has a great arrangement for the strings. \\"On The Road To Find Out\\" has Cat singing beautifully of his quest to find inner peace. Cat then sings of how inner peace is not in any one location; it must be something you create for yourself by using your mind to think freely about how you want your life to be. \\"Father And Son\\" is equally stunning; Cat sings of the typical father and son relationship where the two men simply can't see eye to eye about how to find happiness.<br /><br />Unfortunately, all things must come to an end. The track set ends with the title song for this album, \\"Tea For The Tillerman.\\" This optimistic ballad showcases Cat's excellent vocals; he sings of how the children of today can create a better world of tomorrow.<br /><br />The liner notes have great artwork--awesome!<br /><br />Cat Stevens remains one of the greatest singers and songwriters of the twentieth century. This album and Cat's other artistry will never be forgotten; it's simply too good to ignore. I highly recommend this for fans of Cat Stevens; and people who enjoy classic '70s rock ballads will listen to this album for years to come.<br /><br />Enjoy!The liner notes have great artwork--awesome!

0876852630|4.0|A classic book of the damned poet Bukowski. Not for people with a weak stomach or prudes. Chinaski (the alter-ego of Bukowski) hops from one job to another, one woman to another, and is steadily drunk.<br />Some exceedingly realistic moments of the narration make you think that Bukowski has really been in that situation, or that he has a supreme imagination.<br />Although a little repetitive at times, this book is a necessary read for people interested in the nature of the human soul.

B000OCXFCO|5.0|Megadeth shows that there is no signs of stopping the delivery of powerful thrash metal. Although many consider \\"The System Has Failed\\" their comeback album (which is true in many ways considering what was put out by the band before), \\"United Abominations\\" is the insurance record that they are BACK and still strong. Musically, it's better than \\"System\\" as the musical complexity of their older years are more present here than on System, and the guitar riffs are total Megadeth here - no boring \\"Black Album\\" like metal riffs - pure technical metal riffage! Any Megadeth fans out there? This is a must have!
B000F3T3E6|3.0|\\"Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno\\" (The Triumph of Time and Dis-Illusion) is often called Handel's first oratorio, although it is more a large-scale Italian cantata or serenata, like \\"Aci, Galatea, e Polifemo\\" or \\"Apollo e Dafne.\\" Handel wrote this, the original, version of the work during his formative stay in Italy in 1707.    Gramophone's reviewer (July 2007) says that this performance might seem \\"fabulous . . . for a casual listener.\\"  However, its \\"fizzy flamboyance\\" comes across as \\"artificial eccentricity,\\" and the conductor's \\"mannerisms prevent natural flow and continuity.\\"    Preferable is the August 2007 reissue of Renato Alessandrini recording on Naive--especially at its two-disc-for-one bargain price [[ASIN:B000LE0TEM Haendel: Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno]].  Read my review of Alessandrini's performance for information about Handel's other two versions of this work.    Paul N. Van de Water

B0009IOR6Q|4.0|True to form, Johnny Depp picks the campiest, goofiest, off-beat roles.  \\"Cry Baby\\" is almost kind of sort of a take off of \\"Grease\\" but it's so silly and so fun that it's in a totally different genre.  The ending drags a bit and the end itself leaves you going, \\"Huh?\\"; but all in all it's a fun flick, especially for Depp-aholics.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|i saw \\"grind house\\" at the theater and i loved it! i will not be boycotting the dvd when it is released,but i have this to say: it should not be divided into 2 seperate dvds. why? in my opinion(and im sure others)this movie,even though 2 seperate films, is meant to be veiwed as 1 complete movie.together,with the faux trailers,make a great film.these 2 films seen as one,compliment each other.as seperate films,they may just be good films.(think lennon with out mcartny). i say to mr tarintino, mr rodriguez and mr weinstein release all 3 versions,theatrical and the 2 seperate versions,you cant go wrong! just 1 more thing. i read and hear alot about tarintino and rodriguez's \\"over indulging\\" in their grindhouse films. well to these critics i say you just dont get it.i feel that the 2 directors are having fun with their movies,and want to share that fun with the audiance.ie the scene in grind house at the military installation with quentin tarintino as a crazed soldier.grind house may not be for every taste,but i enjoyed it.boycott if you wish.

0316018953|4.0|The Overlook was not my favorite of the Bosch series, but I did enjoy it!<br /><br />The Overlook was a different sort of Harry story, dealing with the possibility of a murder tied into terrorism and national security.  I felt it was a wise move on the author's part to give us a little something different....I've enjoyed all 13 Harry novels, but of course we need fresh topics.  I felt Connelly did a pretty good job, however I felt the book a little short on suspense.  What I mean by that is, that I was very curious while reading to know what was going to happen, but some times the scenario's fell short.  And actually, for the first time, I was able to guess the ending, or at least the \\"who did it\\".  So, I feel like those things made this book not as much of a favorite of the Bosch series.  But definitely still worth the read.<br /><br />To anyone who has yet to read the Harry Bosch series, I'd recommend starting at the beginning.  If that is not of interest to you, I'd recommend one of novels I consider a \\"gem\\" in the series, like Concrete Blonde, Darkness More Than Night, Trunk Music, Angel's Flight or The Narrows.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|First, I'm a huge LP fan, second, this album was such a let down for many of fans that were waiting as usual for LP to bring a new album out, because they do that they take their time with each album to make it solid. But with MTM I don't know why I feel like they were more influenced by Rubin to change their sound, I'm using as reference interviews from mtv with the guys and the booklet on the album. Rubin influenced this guys to change the sound of LP, but remember as Mike said on the frat party DVD, The sound defines the name, I think they forgot that concept, the concept that made them unique...<br />Also it makes me sad that the band that once had full good critics today is giving thank yous and credit for half the fans that liked this album,, what about those fans that were left hanging by this record???  This album has 2 or 3 great songs, don't get me wrong, but from LP I never skipped songs, in MTM I have to, most of the track list :(<br />If you really like  their Hybrid Theory and Meteora for that sound, Don't expect anything from this one as it separates itself completely from it's really deep, worth anything, melodic, perfect talent predecessors...<br />2 stars because I really like the band and i have hope that they'll come back with their unique style again... as for MTM, bad page in the bands book!!

0595440096|5.0|In \\"Still Alice\\" it is uncanny how Lisa Genova gets everything right. Reading it was like reliving the adventure Jenny Knauss and I have had with AD since her diagnosis the first of April 2002.    We have good friends who have written first person accounts of living with AD - Tracy Mobley, Charles Schnieder, and Richard Taylor - and those, and other, particular accounts are invaluable.    Lisa has followed the path of fiction to create a more universal picture of AD. Here many morsels of AD are distilled into the life of one person - Alice - which makes a very potent brew. In fiction Lisa can artfully connect the lurches and crashes of AD and carry the reader along smoothly, but with a powerful driving force. Many a signature morsel of AD is blended so artfully that one doesn't realize that it is there until the taste is almost over - as it is in reality.    And, there is a progressive point of view. Rather than treat people living with AD as victims who need help from the social workers dominating the AD establishment, we should treat Alice as still Alice still living her still real life.     The speech by Alice (pages 249 to 252) to a fictional plenary symposium of the annual Alzheimer's Association Dementia Care Conference of 2005 is a manifesto for the progressive view that our approach to AD should be to help people living with AD enrich their lives and have fun. (Jenny made the same points in a conversation for a plenary symposium at the actual Dementia Care Conference in July 2005.)    This book should be read not just by everyone embarking on an adventure with AD, but by everyone. It will give you the most potent and universal understanding of the AD experience, and it will motivate you to become a champion for the more progressive view of AD.    I predict that this wonderful book will become a best seller because of praise by readers.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This season of Lost is, in my opinion, the best season yet! It contains some of the most brilliantly crafted and acted episodes of the series so far. The first six episodes pick up where Season 2 left off and tells the story of what happened to Kate, Sawyer and Jack while being held by The Others. They are all solid episodes but when Lost returned from it's hiatus in February, this show started to heat up like nothing you have ever seen. WOW!!! Some of the Season 3 episodes are likely to go down as some of the BEST television episodes OF ALL TIME! When Season 3 finally reaches it's conclusion with the MIND BLOWING FINALE, you can't help but be profoundly affected.    On a personal note: Desmond, I LOVE YOU! I will look for you until the END OF TIME! Do not give up hope.
0385522401|5.0|This novel will richly reward anyone who appreciates serious literature and writing as craft.  McEwan's control of his narrative is breathtaking: the first section ranks with the best-written passages I've read.  The novel tells the sad story of a star-crossed couple back in 1962, young people stumbling over their own limitations and the stultifying sexual inhibition of their time.  It's beautifully wrought.  McEwan doesn't waste a word as his concise story works towards it's entirely appropriate conclusion.  I recommend this highly to any serious reader.
817224164X|5.0|Achtung, Baby!<br /><br />Mein Kampf has a nasty reputation. When it comes right down to it, Mein Kampf is a bad dog, a bad, bad dawg. If Mein Kampf were human, it would be the balding forty-year old guy with the canting glass eye who loiters down by the stairwell selling tap-dancing aphids out of a hat.<br /><br />But if you step back, take a deep breath, get the mental picture of grim soot blackened kilns and miles of concertina fence and razor wire and baying German shepherds and slaughterhouses & black-smoke belching smokestacks festering and brooding beneath a slate-grey sky---<br /><br />Where were we? Oh yes: if you get past that stuff, you'll be able to see Mein Kampf for what it really is: the world's most influential Self-Help manual.<br /><br />Who needs Dale Carnegie & all that \\"Smile 'til your Gums Bleed!\\" crap when you've got Adolf Hitler: Carnegie wants you to wag your tail & get another friend, Hitler wants you to wag your fist in your enemy's face & slice off another rump puppet state.<br /><br />Let's take a little mental inventory of Adolf Hitler, circa 1923: starving, failed artist, no money to pay the rent, wandered around ranting and drinking all day in beerhalls, and worst of all, stuck in the Munich pokey after he and the boys got knocked around by the local hoo-haw after a wild night gomezing around on the town and a few too many Heffeweisen.<br /><br />And yet this guy, not even a decade later, is not only shooting hoops and slam dunks but kicking everybody's [EXPLETIVE!] around the court. Around about 1941, Hitler doesn't have any time left to kick [EXPLETIVE!] & take names. Why? Because he's too busy kicking [NAUGHTY!] to take names.<br /><br />With that in mind, let's break this little masterwork of Teutonic Take-no-Prisoners Motivation down by the numbers & see what Mein Kampf can do for you---today!<br /><br />1) Give in to your Anger! Your Hate will make you Strong! Whether it's building a battle station that can destroy a planet in a single blast or emptying the Eastern Marches of Bolshevik Scum, get in touch with your Inner Monster & give that bad  boy a ticket to ride!<br /><br />2) It's all about Marketing! Coco Chanel knew it! Tommy Hilfiger knew it! Idi Amin knew it!---Marketing Matters! Hitler proved it. Schwag matters. Gift boxes matter! Little corporate doohickeys with your logo & slogan on it---all of that matters.<br /><br />WWHD?---'What would Hitler Do?' He'd make it colorful! Primary colors, baby, lots of red and black and white! He'd add chrome! He'd come up with a catchy slogan. He'd probably have a military march with torches somewhere in there! He'd invade Poland!<br /><br />3) Mission Statement: KISS goes here (\\"Keep it SS\\"): make it brutally simple. Example: a) Revenge the betrayed fatherland by shooting the Bolshevik rotters; b) hold lots of torchlit parades; c) invade Russia.<br /><br />Show me, don't tell me. It's results that count, daddy-o. See #3.<br /><br />3) Business is War! Get in the other guy's face & scream! Make him wipe your spittle off his mouth! Yes! Go over the line! Pound on the table all you want to, but if you don't get what you want, it's time to cross the enemy's line of Death! No more Mr. Nice Guy!<br /><br />Your Enemies are a bunch of Fairies! They shave their legs & go cycling after work. Think I'm wrong? Think Carstairs in Accounting has the mojo to take you on, Dear Leader? Try nailing his cat to his desk. Your patience is at an end! Exactly! Would you like a little Belgium or France with your order, Sir?<br /><br />4)Shoot your rivals. What about Carruthers, the guy from Marketing? Seriously, Old Hoss, keep an eye on that guy. He's quiet, he's shifty eyed, he does what you tell him, and when you screamed at him in that P&L meeting last week he---I jest thee not---he wet himself. That said, remember: it's the quiet ones who get ya, one way or another. Hitler, for instance. Hitler was a frustrated Marketing guy, too.<br /><br />It's kinda funny tothink about, but had someone back on the old arts school admissions council at the Vienna School for Drawing Little Teutonic stick figures decided to let Hitler in, we'd have gotten about 15 years of bad cubist stuff instead of the Blitz & the Holocaust.<br /><br />5) Strike first! Strike hard! Kill! Kill! Pick yourself up out of the gutter and get back on that Tiger tank! You think it's enough to humiliate Dimwiddy in the board room, you lunk? Fool! You've got to destroy Dimwiddy! You've got to crush him, annex his office space, invade and destroy all those little projects that mean so much to him, get him fired, laugh as he has to haul all his personal shxt out in a cardboard box---and even then it's not over! You've got to gloat, gloat and cackle, when you spot him on the street corner, down in the gutter, eating his daily ration of cat food out of a tin! Shove his face in that horsemeat! Push!<br /><br />6) Never Underestimate the Stupidity of the Masses: This is a biggie. Think about it: you're German, it's 1930, and one of the candidates for Reichs Chancellor has a shifty looking brush moustache. When asked about his resume, he replies nonchalantly about being big on killing vermin.<br /><br />Would you vote for that guy? Guess what? They did! Hitler won in a landslide! If he can, you can too!<br /><br />With that in mind, ACHTUNG! Baby! We got a little Liebensrauming to do.<br /><br />JSGeutonic stick figures decided to let Hitler in, we'd have gotten about 15 years of bad cubist stuff instead of the Blitz & the Holocaust.     5) Strike first!

You've got to gloat, gloat and cackle, when you spot him on the street corner, down in the gutter, eating his daily ration of cat food out of a tin! Shove his face in that horsemeat! Push!    6) Never Underestimate the Stupidity of the Masses: This is a biggie. Think about it: you're German, it's 1930, and one of the candidates for Reichs Chancellor has a shifty looking brush moustache. When asked about his resume, he replies nonchalantly about being big on killing vermin.    Would you vote for that guy? Guess what? They did! Hitler won in a landslide! If he can, you can too!     With that in mind, ACHTUNG! Baby! We got a little Liebensrauming to do.    JSG
B000E33VWW|4.0|This film is a generally excellent piece of realism about writer Truman Capote and the making of his early 1960s \\"non-fiction novel\\" about the murder of a Kansas farm family, In Cold Blood.  The performances, cinematography, design, pacing, and (for the most part) direction and editing cannot be faulted.  My problem is the moral premise as embodied in the script.<br /><br />The script sets up Capote's childhood friend, author Harper Lee of To Kill a Mockingbird fame, as his co-worker and moral conscience, esentially convicting him of exploiting the killers on death row, \\"wanting them dead\\" finally so that Capote could publish the book.  I have no idea if this indictment of Capote derived from Harper Lee, who is an admirable figure and admirably portayed.  But even if true, the conclusion borders on the glib, and is questionable.  The essential fault of the movie is that it builds this indictment of Capote as a writer, but does not give him equally resonant words to justify his methods or ends.  It simply assumes that fame, writing a best seller, etc, is a bad and inferior motive.  And it assumes that was Capote's motive.<br /><br />Capote was a weird, quirky enough figure and is rather easily parodied.  He was a marginal, desperately lonely figure, mawkish, embarrassing, somewhat perverse.  But what he was doing was a literary experiment.  It took somebody like him to enter this no man's land.  The book was successful in its own right and on its own merits.  It has indeed had an influence on American art and literature, some very good and some bad.  But the experimental nature of the project was bound to incur unknown personal and psychological costs and risks.  Art is necessary for any mature society to see itself, and while that premise does not justify any art or any experiment, it is enough to justify a serious endeavor like In Cold Blood.<br /><br />Secondly, the charge of Capote exploiting the killers is highly questionable.  They were clearly guilty, had due process of law, and the idea either that (1) Capote could have done more for them, i.e., getting better lawyers for more appeals, or (2) such appeals would have been justified or successful, is really highly questionable.  One cannot impose present day legal ideals, or attitudes about capital punishment, ex post facto on the early 1960s.  There were trials in that day truly way out of line (the Sam Shepard carnival in Ohio upon which The Fugitive was based) which make better and fairer comparison than present day assumptions.  There is no evidence the Kansas killers were treated in anything but a sober and deliberate manner for those times, by the system.  Their execution was an inevitability.  And the so-called \\"lies\\" Capote told Perry Smith were not only either harmless (he personally hadn't settled on a book title), or weirdly humane (i.e., his sister still cared for him).  Are these the sort of sins with which we convict major art in this country these days?  If so, it says more about us -- a descent toward the trivially personal over 45 years, with a tendancy to send people up the flagpole for derision.  Both tendancies were notably absent from Capote's final product, by the way, as to all concerned -- whatever misdemeanors (or mere infractions) he may have committed along the way.<br /><br />But you do not have to like Truman Capote personally, or even like his book, to believe that his cause deserved more of a voice in this project.  The fact is, the plain people of Kansas gave the In Cold Blood killers a fairer trial than this film does Truman Capote.  Thus for all its great aesthetic merits, which carry it far, this film is ultimately not satisfying as either an unbiased record or as a moral tale.idea either that (1) Capote could have done more for them, i.e., getting better lawyers for more appeals, or (2) such appeals would have been justified or successful, is really highly questionable.

B00004YA0T|5.0|Bruckner fans can find other recordings of certain symphonies that might reveal some aspect of the music that this set does not. But I think those recordings are far and few. I know there are Jochum fans (and I am one)who find his DG recordings to be superior. Except for the Fourth with the Berlin Philharmonic I have not listened to any of them.So they may be better. But it is a little hard for me to conceive of that being the case because I have found that Jochum has pulled off something nearly miraculous here.I first bought this set back in the very early Nineties when it first was released on CD. I was swept up in the sheer passion,exuburance and religous devotion that is on display. Like other reviewers I think a lot of the credit goes to Staatskapelle Dresden.I find them so involved with Bruckner's music and the thought world he inhabited that any point of criticism would be nearly useless. \\"The petty cavils of petty minds\\",as Samuel Johnson said of some of Shakespeare's critics.Yes this will be a set I could live with for some time( I already have!) And I would still recomend getting this remastered version because it is superior to the first version and the box takes up far less room. I don't have the same problem that some people have with the Nowak versions. I do prefer the 1877 version of the 3rd symphony to be superior to Nowak's. But I find Georg Tintner's recording on Naxos to be interesting but it is too ungainly and sprawling. So I would prefer the Nowak,though I don't care for some of the cuts. But even if you have reservations about versions I would still urge you to check out Jochum. I think he will convince you.Enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When you try to explain the premise of this series to someone, inevitably their eyes glaze over... A SPACE WESTERN??? YES! And boy, is it GOOD and sooo FUNNY!    This short lived series is a real gem. It is a delightful tale of a rag- tag group of free spirited pioneers out in the black, deep reaches of space, eking out a living on petty theft and scavenging escapades in an old Firefly class space ship. Most of the planets and moons they visit are reminiscent of the wild west on Earth, which makes sense considering they are the new outposts of human colonization.    The acting, writing, and production of this series was first rate. This show could have evolved into a CLASSIC! It was prematurely cancelled before the plot lines could be fully developed and this is a CRYING SHAME!  This is a series that deserves a second chance. Hopefully, it will one day be resurrected. Until then, this lone season of Firefly is worth it's weight in gold.
B000QQFKYE|2.0|I am a big David Lynch fan but this film is nonsence. Yep sure David is once again delving into the subconcious and dream states but he has done it before and better. At least in films like Mulholland Drive you can follow the film to some degree and try and peel back the mystery. Inland Empire is purely a nonsensical opportunity for David Lynch to throw as many of his weirdo ideals and artistry into the one film and not care about any structure or form. At three hours in length and moving at the pace of a sloth this film is truly an endurance test which is quite frankly not worth the effort. Save your crazy stuff for your art shows Dave and get back to making films like Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart which prove how much better a discernable plotline can be.
B000QUCNP4|1.0|Movie was too long, no character development-people just seem to pop up out of nowhere. Keeping track of all the names mentioned throughout the movie was an unending labyrinth which I couldn't muster enough interest to cut through (yawn). Furthermore, the woman who played Gyllenhaal's wife was creepier than the alleged \\"Zodiac Killer\\" himself. Robert Downey Jr. was the only redeeming quality about this film. Yes, Downey Jr. and the case the DVD came in with several misprints, the credits to Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\" and the credits to \\"Music & Lyrics\\". HMM-the case itself was more intriguing than the movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the only review I have submitted on Amazon, and Firefly is the only DVD I have purchased for a TV series!! Firefly is incredible, and it's a shame it was canceled so early.
B000F3A7LE|4.0|Robert Fripp is best known as the pillar of \\"King Crimson\\" but has performed with countless artist. He is a true musicians musician. Exposure was Fripp's experience living in New York in the late '70s. Darryl Hall sings on several tracks.(Very different than most of his work) This album is said to be the begining of a whole different genre of music. I say that's true. It's a mix of ambient, hard rock, and experimental. If you want something that is revolutionary for your collection, give it a try.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|As an avid fan of Jidei Geki and Anime I am probably more attuned to the Japanese storytelling style than most westerners. This one is a really well told and beautifully visual story of a group of losers who manage to come off as heroes. Some will be offended by the side story of a love interest between a drag queen and a burned out straight, but the story wouldn't work without that thread. It really dips into the misery of the human condition and yet the ability of the human spirit to rise above it all. A must-have film for the true anime buff, but it is  not for children. Very deep and complex once you get into it.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This movie is great, beautiful, sensitive. The director was able to show the soul of the people and the culture involved with it. The drama is simple: the leader of the community asked the Gods to send a new healer and leader. He is expecting a men, but the Gods sent a woman. And the little girl must proove, by herself, that she was sent by the Gods. It has to do with the blindness of the soul which some leaders hold -- sometimes in the name of God.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|We recently just bought a brand new Pioneer plasma(PDP-4280HD) and have a PS3 to compliment the TV. Throwing in this great movie just about made everything perfect.
6305910340|5.0|I watched this movie several times when I was a kid and I remember liking it. I will admit that I loved chess and that probably made me biased towards it.     Two days ago I watched it again for the first time in maybe a decade. And there's a question that I've been asking myself: Now that I'm an adult and not that interested in chess do I like it as much now as I did when I was a kid?    Honestly, no. I like it even more now. And that's because this film is not really about chess. It's about life. It's about the people who influence us, our fears, our struggles, respect and even compassion towards each other, and trying to decide what really is important in our lives. Knowing a little bit about chess might enhance your pleasure in the film but it also might not: chess is really only the context of the story.    This film also has what seems like flawless acting. The actor who plays the chess genius Josh (Max Pomeranc) might have given the most believable performance any kid has ever given in any movie. Ever.     Of the 38 films that I have reviewed so far, there is no film that I recommend more than Searching for Bobby Fischer. I may not be as good at chess as I once was but for your next move, I have a strong recommendation: buy this film.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|Red is a King Crimson masterpiece! It's heavier than so much that's out even now. Title track \\"Red\\" is a guitar great. It kind of laid the basis for King Crimson's sound all the way to even the 21st century. \\"Starless and Bible Black\\" is a 12 minute song that puts a spell on you. It's beautiful and dark, and then goes into a rampage.<br />What the album lacks in tracks, it makes up with an unforgettable ride. A must buy for all!
B000PY52EU|4.0|For a movie packed with graphic imagery, infused with heart-thumping blues music, and then generously splattered with raw emotion, the plot of Black Snake Moan is remarkably simple.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson plays Lazarus, a Tennessee farmer and former blues guitarist whose wife takes off with his brother for some good times.  Naturally he doesn't take the news very well, but before he can even come to grips with his loss, he finds a badly beaten young girl (Christina Ricci, who seems to thrive on challenging roles) dumped on the roadway near his house.  Strange as it may seem, being beaten and left for dead are just two of Rae's problems, as her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) has just left to join the National Guard, leaving her out of sync and all alone with her regular attacks of nymphomania.<br /><br />Lazarus knows that calling the sheriff could result in some unpleasant interrogation based purely on skin color, so being a religious man, he does the Good Samaritan thing and does his best to help Rae, both physically and mentally.  The thing is, when Rae gets her attacks, she's inclined to go running wildly away from the house, and so Lazarus decides to restrain her with chains, which actually sounds a lot kinkier than it actually is.  Obviously this is not an ideal situation, and it gets worse when Ronnie returns home unexpectedly.<br /><br />Extremely well acted by both leads, with more than acceptable Blues renditions by Jackson, and even the deer-in-the-headlights performance by Timberlake wasn't that bad, given the character he plays.  Not recommended for below 17 yrs, due to violence, profanity, graphic scenes and the fact that Timberlake leaves the singing to Jackson.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 3, 2007
0060977493|4.0|I also had a hard time getting through this book.  I would read a chapter and put it down for a couple of days.  I was distracted by the style of writing (very poetic) and kinda grossed out by some of the characters. I didn't even like the twins who are the main characters.  There were several times when I didn't want to pick it back up to finish it.      I am so glad I did.  I finished the book several days ago and am still haunted by the ending. I feel sad about Rahel and Estha but it was Velutha and Ammu's relationship which was the most powerful for me.  How tragic and so beautiful. Definitely worth your time...
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|great movie. alot of parts are different from the book but its still a great movie. alot of blood, grusome.
0316018953|4.0|Widely, deservedly popular author Michael Connelly (\\"The Poet,\\" \\"Bloodwork,\\" \\"Angels Flight,\\"\\"Echo Park\\") has given us more than a dozen Los Angeles-set police procedurals starring Hieronymous (Harry) Bosch, Los Angeles detective named after a well-known 16th century Dutch painter of horror scenes.  The author has penned quite a few best-selling standalones, too.  He wrote \\"The Overlook\\" to be serialized in The Sunday New York Times: we have it now between book covers.<br /><br />\\"Overlook\\" brings us Bosch on a new assignment, Homicide Special, with a new, hispanic partner Ignacio Ferras.  The cop's called out on a new case, his first in this assignment.  A body has been found on the overlook near Mulholland Drive.  The victim, Dr. Stanley Kent, appears to have been dispatched execution style, with two bullet holes in the back of his head.  Kent is swiftly discovered to have access to dangerous radioactive substances from most Los Angeles County hospitals.  This brings in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who tromp all over Bosch's case: the FBI comes bringing Agent Rachel Walling, Bosch's former lover, whom we've met earlier in the series; she recently reappeared (as many of Connelly's characters do) in his last Bosch, \\"Echo Park.\\"  The writer gives his detective a meet with LA's current Police Commissioner William Bratton, formerly successful in New York and Boston; he handles it in quite an interesting way.<br /><br />The book opens fast, like a hot-wired car, and is 0-60 in no time.  It's also rather short, at 225 pages, really only novella length; don't know how any fan of his could resist finishing it at a sitting.  Connelly's descriptive writing on LA, as ever, is better than any travelogue, though he did seem to be devoting rather more time than usual to traffic reports and the state of the roads.  His writing, however, is as sharp as ever.  Of Bosch's new partner Ferras, Connelly says, \\"Like many detectives he preferred to use his own laptop because the computers provided by the department were old and slow and most of them carried more viruses than a Hollywood Boulevard hooker.\\"  Or, in a discussion of Bosch's Vietnam War experience, the author says, \\"That was the day when he /Bosch/ knew that men of rank often fought battles with enemies that were inside.\\"  Speaking of the Vietnam War, this brings me to a problem: we've been told, since the first Bosch, that he fought in Vietnam.  Anybody who fought there must now be at least 60; and that's consistent with the age Bosch has always been given.  But here, he's suddenly given an age of 53, near his author's.  It can't be.<br /><br />Be that as it may, Bosch does manage to solve his case here, by his usual tight focus on the victim of the crime, and the facts of the case; and his refusal to be distracted by the FBI's \\"greater considerations.\\"  The plot itself, however, is neither as fresh, nor as resonant, as those in some of his earlier works.  Guess it's to be expected at this point.ed by the department were old and slow and most of them carried more viruses than a Hollywood Boulevard hooker.\\"  Or, in a discussion of Bosch's Vietnam War experience, the author says, \\"That was the day when he /Bosch/ knew that men of rank often fought battles with enemies that were inside.\\"  Speaking of the Vietnam War, this brings me to a problem: we've been told, since the first Bosch, that he fought in Vietnam.

B000059TEP|5.0|I was one of those people who did not run to see this movie in theaters and waited many years to see it on video. I watched it again recently in my home theater and it holds up amazingly well. It has elements of romance,action,comedy,suspense and even horror! Yes horror! It may not be the gorefest we see now-a-days, but demons dragging their victim to hell after being impaled by a huge plate glass window falling like a guillotine through their chest qualifies in my book. The story is ingeniously written and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show and won a well deserved Oscar for her role as a \\"psychic medium\\" in this classic tale of greed, betrayal, revenge and unbound love! I have the older edition and the transfer looks excellent.
B000IOM0WO|4.0|Paramount foolishly pulled out of Blu-Ray.  If you want this, get it quick, once it's gone, it's gone.  (Until Paramount come back when HD DVD dies).
B00008AY3L|5.0|Don't listen to the negative reviews of this cd it is one of the best and liveliest albums i've ever heard save for one or two songs. People just don't enjoy it because they're probably just the original fans of his early more simple music. The quality of Diamonds sounds like a pop album and it's great. The album just Hits its so diverse and has everything from Reggae to Jam Rock to Funk,Heavy Blues, an Italian love song with an accordion, to Spiritual songs inspired by World Music. I love all his stuff especially his newest cd Lifeline but this is one of my favorites.
0060531053|5.0|This book was at my side when I started homebrewing and I strongly recommend it for beginners.  I found that getting over the hurdle of brewing the first batch was the most intimidating thing, and brewing becomes much easier starting with you second batch.  This book is excellent at walking a total newbie like I was through the process of the first batch.  Plenty of detail, descriptions and steps laid out.  The book also has a good catalog of different beer types from around the world, a handy guide to their ingredients, and then a long list of straitforward recipes that help you brew them.  Pretty good hops list too.  I've recommended this book to anyone I know who's getting started.
B000069AT7|5.0|I bought the E.T. Box set at a reduced price recently because I refused to buy the altered version of the film! THIS HAS GOT TO STOP AND STOP NOW! Where do we draw the line? Are we gong to do CGI over the original \\"King Kong\\"? Are we going to color Hattie McDaniels's skin color white in \\"Gone With The Wind\\"? It is getting ridiculous what we are putting up with! People need to get over themselvies and stop being so sensitive. I just watched the Godfather trilogy and I'm Italian American! Am I complaining that Italians are protrayed as Gangsters? No! We could go back and forth all day talking about this, but in short....let things stay intact! No altering films or art etc., whether its a classic or not! It is what it is! OK?????? Ahhhh I feel slightly better now! The original film E.T is a wonderful film that seemed even better than I remembered. The DVD transfer looks great and the audio was really surprisingly good! The is an excellent film, but look for the gift set cheap. AVOID THE SINGLE DISC LIKE THE PLAGUE!
B000S0GYRU|1.0|It's not the point that Italian films were shot this way. Spaghetti westerns are a whole different animal. They had sparse dialouge and the bad dubbing didn't matter to the plot, but Suspiria, a film that depends on suspense and thrills, is a different matter. The english dubbed track is so bad it takes you right out of the picture.   I would much rather listen to a dubbed Italian track and read subtitles than have to listen to bad and laughable performances in english. A perfect example would be Argento's Bird with a Crystal Plumage - a teriffic mystery thriller that greatly benefits from it's multiple language tracks.   All I'm saying is to at least give the viewer the choice.
B000J103PC|4.0|Not quite a grown-up's movie (maybe more like 14), it's still a fun way to wile away a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood for thinking.  Meryl Streep's role isn't difficult, but she's fun to watch and effective enough to distract you from the well-worn plot.  The heroine is more believable as a fashion trollop than a serious journalist. The saucy co-worker is too stereotyped, and a collection of friends only adds filler and backdrop to the story.  Even the poor boyfriend only gets one dimension to his character.  Did I mention the pat ending?  But it has it's moments of charm.  Those of us who have worked for a Miranda Priestly can nod along as we laugh.

I hope everyone finds as much enjoyment in it as I do.
0517147688|5.0|For all those Jane Austen fans, what more could you ask for than to have all the works of Jane Austen beautifully bound in one book.  This is a book that you can pass down to your Grandchildren.  A great display piece for your bookshelf also.

B0000524CY|5.0|In my youth I watched every horror movie I could get my hands on, and although some of them scared me none of them utterly owned my nights for as long as this did after seing it!  Never will you find a movie with as scary and disturbing(Saw fans... please be serious here!) a premise as what was put to film here.  Trust me... I've been trying my entire adult life and this is truly the pinnacle of horror.  This is one of those movies that is so great you must own it, and yet you never watch it!  And that is a total testament to how powerful this really is.  Nobody in the history of mankind has ever decided on a whim to wach The Exorcist a second time for \\"something to do.\\"  You have to get prepared, like a week in advance!  The only way you watch The Exorcist spontaneously is if you have someone over who has never seen it and you forsake your own good sense to watch them completely lose their mind!  So I guess what I'm trying to say is that this is my favorite horror film of all time... yet also my least favorite to watch.  Make any sense?  If not, watch the film alone and with the lights off... you can thank/curse me later!
0345363132|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening read. I love the way she makes the characters come alive. No cardboard cut outs here! By making over Richard, one gets a more balanced picture of what might have happened. The supporting cast--Buckingham, Hastings, Elizabeth, etc.--are well drawn, too, and the complexity of the period is brought out in an exciting way. Loved it!

B000RIWAYY|5.0|An amazing album and a very interesting DVD to be placed on top of the archive =)
1590171993|4.0|I found myself thinking about William Stoner for days after I finished the novel. John Williams's portrait of a teacher whose colleague and students take him for granted is beautifully drawn. I found the nasty faculty politics, and particularly the character of Lomax, convincing, as well. However, Williams does not have as deft a touch with the characterizations of the women in the novel. Edith is too bizarre to be believed, Grace too thinly sketched, Katherine Driscoll too one-dimensional. Edith, a gothic horror, seems to have come straight from Mr. Rochester's attic in Jane Eyre. This flawed aspect of the novel keeps it from being the masterpiece others have called it.
B000002VCU|5.0|This one I had on vinyl back in the day.  I'd put the arm over side 2 and pull back for repeated listens.  The Turn of a Friendly Card is one of my favorite records, but side 2 of that record (which sounds great on CD!!) is near and dear to my heart.  On those days where there seemed to be nothing to do and I'd read all I could read, I'd put this one on and go to dreamland.  I still love the production Alan Parsons would put on his and other artists efforts.  This is recomended for people who like AOR, Prog, or just classic rock in general.
B000B5XOXY|3.0|After the Superman-like credits are shown to a theme song less exciting than Danny Elfman's original, we're treated to a taller sleeker Batman than the Burton efforts. But the action starts way too soon. If only they kept it simpler. They should have chosen either Two-face or Riddler to be Batman's adversary, not both. I found Jim Carrey's Riddler to be a little more stylish and palatable over Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face, but that's not saying much. I thought he acted a little too nutty. Jones' Two-Face was annoying, drew too much attention to itself, and almost destroyed the whole film. In a word it was just plain WRONG.  Also Harvey Dent before becoming Two-face was somewhat of a good looking ladies man. Let's just say Tommy was too \\"weathered\\" for the role. Plus I think the deformed side of his face should have been a very pale bluish green instead.  I enjoyed this for the most part when I saw it at the theater, because I saw no hype or promos. I just saw it listed in the paper for the local theater and went the next day. Since I had no preconceived expectations I suffered no disappointment. That doesn't mean the movie was without flaws. This had it's fair share. I didn't like the Batmobile. Two-Face murdering the Grayson family was totally inaccurate. The person responsible for that worked for a crime boss who in turn threw the acid at Harvey Dent's face in the courtroom thus causing him to become Two-Face, long after the death of the Flying Graysons. But the less you know about Batman the more you can enjoy these films. The silver batsuit looked too wierd. The ending was anticlimatic, but because the Batman's origin was gone into a little bit more indepth it edged its way into a weak 3 stars. I remember leaving the movie house and getting into my car. \\"Kiss From A Rose\\" by Seal was playing on the radio. How eerie is that? Well anyway if you liked this one a lot or just want to keep up your Batman collection, buy this 2 disc set or the 8 disc Anthology.
B000AA4M9U|5.0|B.B. King's compilation of duets with some incredible rock musicians is one of the few CDs I can listen to over and over again without getting tired of it. Hearing Roger Daltry and Billy Gibbons sing with King is a treat! There is not one track that I don't love. After his first trip to America, Clapton said that the highlight was meeting B.B. King. His music with this legend over the years has shown his respect. At almost 82 years old, King still puts on an incredible show and has no plans to retire, as he tells his audience during his current tour.
1596912855|2.0|I wanted to like this book much more than I did. As an Austen fan, the premise sounded interesting, but as I was reading, it became more and more creepy. The whole idea of going to a \\"resort\\" where male actors are paid to romance the guests does seem one step above a brothel. What self-respecting woman would enjoy that? I also found it a little unbelievable that Jane, the narrator and a P&P addict, would not realize that Mr. Nobley was playing the Mr. Darcy role. There were so many parallels between Nobley's behavior and Darcy's in the book/movies, yet more than once Jane said \\"he's no Mr. Darcy.\\" Jane wasn't particularly likable or consistent in what she wanted, and I couldn't understand her attachment to the Martin character, particularly at the end. The ending itself is completely predictable, yet ludicrous at the same time. Without spoiling the details, nothing like that could happen, considering modern-day airport security. It is a quick read and the blurbs about Jane's former boyfriends were mildly amusing, but unfortunately I can't recommend it.
B000FA57N0|3.0|I purchased the FIREFLY series awhile before this film came out.

B00004RFFS|1.0|This has to be one of the silliest movies I've ever watched. It's about a vampire who doesn't like killing people. Also, he doesn't get along with his fellow vampires very well. There's no real plot. A complete waste of time, money, and talent.
B000UIVRXG|5.0|This movie is down-right funny. The British humor is great and the over the top \\"funny, extreme\\" violence is a great satire on all those blood and gore action films. Can't wait to see Shawn of the Dead now.
0553269631|2.0|I coudn't stop thinking while I was reading this, I couldn't stand more than a hundred pages, that it was a brilliant work for a very sensitive,depressed, lonely, highly intelligenttwenty something writer. Who wasn't made like other folks, and for many artists that's a necessary evil. I havent' read anything else by her, and I don't think I will, I have a feeling life doesn't get better in the works of Carson McCuller and that's too bad.<br />The writing is much better than OK, but,this work is amateurish in structure. There is no impelling story of any kind, just a wearing down, gets to be boring, pastiche of miserable and semi-miserable characters going nowhere except into a future of deepening misery and despair.<br />Yes there are pleanty of folks like that but nothing redeems them here.<br />McCullers is a southern grotesque who lacks the vitality of Flannery O'Connor and the enduring humanity and brilliance of William Faulkner.

B000FBGBPC|5.0|Okay so I'm not a die hard rock fan at all, I listen to some selected few bands here and there. But I heard \\"Animal I've Become\\" on the radio and I decided to buy this cd, my first rock cd. It was awesome. TDG totally balanced their multimusical talent in this album.    So far it has been a year and I still find myself listening to this cd 3 times in a row at each setting. You have to buy this album. You will not be disappointed
B0000019PA|5.0|An album like this comes along once in a very long while.  It is the rare artist that is willing to open themselves up to the world to the extent that Jeff Mangum does on this recording.  Aeroplane is meant to be listened to as one piece, and it is in this context that each song generates it's stongest emotional impact.  Not everyone will be able to handle an album this emotional and most will turn away because of a subconscious fear of getting too close to another human being that they don't even know.  Keep an open mind and listen to Mangum pour his guts out on all over some tape from 1998.  He will paint pictures in your mind, some ugly and some beautiful, but all stemming from pure genius.  A singualr vision from an artist that is missed greatly.  A must own for those who enjoy rock and roll that is difficult and moving.  5 Stars.
0553588486|1.0|On his website he has answered all those asking why the next installment is a year overdue. After whining about missing several conventions in order to work on the book he refers to his readers as trolls. I guess only those who worship him are worthy. It seems the man is too in love with himself to bother with the trolls who have made him rich.<br />Think twice before investing your time and money with this egotistical jerk. He obviously has no idea what to do with his story. I have serious doubts as to his ability to finish this series as he seems to be more interested in other projects than finishing what he started.

630522577X|5.0|I have always loved musicals, growing up watching them all the time, but by far My Fair Lady was the best I have ever watched. I never tire of watching Audrey Hepburn transform from a common flower girl to a lady. Though I was dissappointed that Audrey's voice wasn't used in the songs, there are the original songs with Audrey's voice in the extra features. If you love musicals, this is a must-see!
B000OY8NII|4.0|When I first saw \\"Eureka\\" I did not know what to expect, but the opening sequence/music gave a good hint of what was to come. Good edgy scifi, seasoned with quirky humor, and a strong garnish of drama and sometimes tragedy. Definitey worth purchasing and watching!
B000CNE092|5.0|When this movie first came out, I was very young. I saw it once and was afraid of Rasputin, making me not want to see it again. (I have never been a fan of anything scary, so most cannot go by me.) When I was going through my video cabinet recently, I dug the movie out, trying to remember why I had only seen it once. I put it into the VCR and the from the beginning of the film to the end, the magic never once ceased. Though it isn't exactly historically accurate, it had a happy ending and a great story line. At first my friends and family thought it was crazy that I watched this animated movie over and over, but once they saw it, they had to admit that it was a great movie for all ages. I wouldn't recommend younger children to see this, it can be frightening at the end, though I won't say why. Anastasia and Dimitri's relationship was so realistic, I found myself relating people I know to them. It was absolutely fabulous!
1400063515|4.0|NNT would scold me for reading a handful of reviews before writing mine; I'm no better than those who panned his fictitious Russian author.  Despite his meandering style (an apt description stolen from another review) and his occasionally overwhelming snobbery, it did not take long for me to be convinced of his premise.  It's a book worth reading, though if you're among the legions of business folk who make their living deceiving themselves with their prognostication abilities, I might take pause.  Me, I'm an engineer, one who got a masters in statistics but never got to hear Taleb's ideas in a classroom.  Maybe I wouldn't have been so sick of the subject by the end of the degree if I had.    I'd recommend it to anyone who thinks they have a grasp on the future but be sure to give the author a break - for an enlightened erudite to be anything but insufferable would be a black swan indeed.

B000002UWE|5.0|I haven't heard some of these songs in countless years and it always amazes me how you can fall right back in love with the songs you grew up listening to just by rediscovering them. Its very RARE for me to love a whole CD without at least not liking a few songs but not with this collection, I totally love all the songs that were chosen!. Awesome songs by a awesome band!.
B000R4WMK0|5.0|This bonus edition of the CD is really nice. It includes all the original tracks and two bonus songs. Both of the added songs make it well worth   buying this CD, but the track \\"Losing my Mind\\" is particuarly good (I think, better than some of the tracks that come on the standard version of this CD). All around, very enjoyable listening!
1594489505|5.0|Live inside the hearts of the women of Afghanistan.  I do not want to give the details of this amazing book, however, I can say that it is a book that gives you an inside peek into the lives of the women living in unspeakable conditions.  We cannot even relate to this kind of life as women living here in America.  Although we are not innocent of women being victimized in this country, at least we have the law on the side of women's safety.  This book was about how the men abuse their religious convictions to freely be criminals.  I highly recommend this book.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Best production ever!  I loved it, and tried to give it to my dad as a birthday presant.  Problem was; his DVD only takes regular format.
0684872153|5.0|This is one of those rare instances when listening to a book being read is better than reading it yourself.  I bought this copy of the book for my daughter, who chose it as her summer reading assignment.  Yet the version I treasure is the audiobook, read by the author himself.  My daughter would not have read the book if I hadn't played the audiobook in the car.  Your imagination can't do justice to that Limerick accent and wry delivery; you are hooked in the first two minutes.  A warning: if you listen to it with a young child present, you are likely to have to answer a lot of embarrassing questions.<br /><br />Of course it's a wonderful book: funny, poignant, heartwrenching... you can keep loading on the adjectives.  It has its own music and rhythm as it moves from one small incident to the next, painting a picture of a childhood defined by unimaginable poverty.  The narrative moves from a child's acceptance of his circumstances to the adolescent's ruthless determination to find a way out, while never abandoning the family that mean so much to him.  And the author manages to accomplish this without a trace of sentimentality, and with plenty of deadpan humor.  I would recommend this book - or audiobook - to anyone old enough to cope with its unrestrained language.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|3 1/2 stars.     If you read the CD insert, you know Linkin' Park was trying to re-create their sound and they wanted to make a more mature CD.  I was prepared for this when I listened to the CD.  It takes a few times to listen to, but it's worth it.      I think it's a very good CD.  THere's a good mix of heavy and soft songs.  My favorite song on the CD is \\"Shadow of the Day\\" - it reminds me of U2.  \\"Leave Out All the Rest\\" is also very good.    I would imagine most people would like songs 2 and 4, but my favorite heavy songs were 6 \\"No More Sorrow\\" and 8 \\"What I've Done.\\"    I actually like the President Bush hate song.  That's becoming a requirement on any CD that's released.  All musician think they're freaking politicians - blah blah and whatever.    The CD ended weak.  I didn't care for the last 3 songs and they never grew on me.      I wish the CD would have had more fist-pumping songs, but I enjoyed it.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Pirates are Johnny Depp's curse for ever and even when he becomes a Lord in late Victorian London he manages do choose the author of Peter Pan and thus gets some Captain Hook to shake his hand. But his role is a composition of the best and most difficult type, the type of stunts you don't need a stuntman to do in your place. The film is a real gem for two main reasons. First of all because it is a love story in a time when love was some kind of forbidden goods in the aristocracy. And the love story is so pure, so beyond any doubt that he avoids melodrama when death decides to play his own game with that Johnny who invades the widowed mother's life a little bit too much. Dramatic but not tear-wringing. And the second reason of the beauty of that film is also the reason why it remains feeling intense without being heart rending or heart breaking. The whole film is centered on a bunch of boys and brothers and Peter is so young that we are amazed by his being so present, so good, so mature in his performance. He does not miss a word, a sentiment or an emotion and his so deep acting touches us a lot more than the obstinacy of Death to come and take away what he considers his owed property. And all the rest is nothing but the clothing and beefing up of that power. Johnny Depp becomes a real prodigy in this composition and he looks so serious that we forget the genial clown he is quite often in other films. Peter Pan is a legend and his author is like the Peter of Heavens, the guide and majordomo of our imagination who can introduce us to what real spiritual happiness can be. And we discover we are still able to dream because somewhere the film wakes up the child or even the baby who has never died completely in our life of needs and wants and remembers the cradle that a motherly hand was rocking in a regular and powerful rolling that has inspired our most intimate desires as soon as we were big enough to sleep flat on our stomach in an adult bed. Regular and religious rhythm of that rocking. The religion of coming out of the dream to wake up in a sunny world of pure tenderness.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesthm of that rocking.

B000001EAQ|4.0|\\"You can reach, but you can't grab it,\\" Bono sings at the start of \\"Pop.\\"  That statement is a fitting summary of U2's explorations into electronica and \\"Britpop\\" which hesitantly began with 1991's \\"Achtung Baby,\\" continuing through 1993's highly-experimental \\"Zooropa\\" and on to \\"Pop.\\"  Bono and the gang sound considerably more confident with their new sound at this point, but they aren't holding on to it too tightly; they sound like they could shed it at any moment and move on to something new, like a snake shedding its skin.  Though the common cliche is that David Bowie, who was going through a similar phase in the 1990s, is a \\"musical chameleon,\\" U2's trio of deeply explorative records suggests them as a band more fit for the title.    Because whereas Bowie's more recent records have little in common with early masterpieces like \\"Hunky Dory\\" and \\"Ziggy Stardust,\\" U2 continues to effortlessly swim with the flow of time, setting down one sound and picking up another, and yet still crafting albums which are unmistakably the work of U2.  Comparing \\"Pop\\" to the album which preceded it ten years earlier, the now-classic \\"Joshua Tree,\\" there is little similarity on the surface.  Bono has ceased his spiritual wailings, his cries of \\"I still haven't found what I'm looking for,\\" his search for a deeper meaning in everything, and replaced it all with superficial reflections on selfish desires.  He even seems to be afraid to look inside anymore, with admissions like, \\"To the ones staring at the sun/afraid of what you'll find if you take a look inside/not just deaf and dumb ... staring at the sun/I'm not the only one who'd rather go blind.\\"  But although this less introspective and more what-you-see-is-what-you-get U2 could easily make an effort like \\"Pop\\" fail miserably, it's clear that the band is still searching on the inside, and this is just a stage of their eternal quest for self-discovery: later on in the same song, Bono asserts, \\"I'm staring at the sun/not the only one who's happy to go blind.\\"    Perhaps the group was having an early mid-life crisis.  The subject matter of the songs, below their shallow exteriors, deals with a number of more meaningful issues.  In \\"Do You Feel Loved,\\" it's deception in relationships; in \\"Mofo,\\" a man cries for the loss of his mother (Bono lost his own mother when he was 14 years old); he muses that things would be better \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\"; and in the album closer, the more earthbound \\"Wake Up Dead Man,\\" we see the group at their most lost.  \\"Jesus, Jesus help me,\\" Bono whails, \\"I'm alone in this world, and a f---ed up world it is too.\\"  The most pertinent explanation of the group's stumble into more superficial territory is \\"Gone,\\" each verse a more sincere and pained admission.    But the band can be silly as well as serious.  The pounding, grunting opener, \\"Discotheque,\\" is a blast, a perfect melding of the \\"dance pop\\" which was taking Europe by storm at the time, and the tough, full-strength-ahead razor rock which propelled much of \\"Achtung Baby\\" upward at such a sturdy pace.  Unquestionably, though, the silliest songs on the album are \\"Miami\\" and \\"The Playboy Mansion.\\"  \\"Miami\\" is the most ridiculous song the band has ever written (the chorus finds Bono singing \\"Miami my mammy,\\" and one can just imagine him doing so with a wide smirk on his face).  But despite the lyrics, which are just short of trash (with the exception of \\"Her eyes, all swimming pool blue,\\" which Bono delivers with a shaky-kneed whine), the song is sonically a delight, bringing the group closer to achieving the \\"superficial pop hit\\" that they strive for throughout the record.  The dreamy sway of the Edge's guitar on \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" and the heavy bounce of the drums are more than enough reason to overlook the enormously cheesy lyrics, and even establish the song as one of the best on \\"Pop.\\"    Any U2 album where a song titled \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" is one of the highlights seems like it should be avoided and, hopefully, forgotten as soon as possible.  On the contrary, \\"Pop\\" is a valuable record.  Its distinctly intricate sound and apparently shallow (but truthfully very meaningful) lyrics make it one of U2's most unusual and, therefor, fascinating efforts.  There are moments of no-holds-barred nonsense, like Bono contemplating whether he will be permitted entry into the Playboy Mansion while musing that \\"if Coke is a mystery/and Michael Jackson ... history,\\" what must the world be coming to, but there are also moments of unparalleled beauty, like the Edge's utterly heavenly guitar solo in the divinely sensual \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress.\\"  At the very least, it's important because it was the group's final venture into the 90's electronica buzz, and the point where Bono sang, \\"What you leave behind you don't miss anyway.\\"  The group stayed in their new terrain just long enough, because as they realized upon \\"Pop\\"'s aptly-titled successor, there are some things you can't leave behind.
0374280967|4.0|In chasing after her rowdy dog-pack one day, the Queen discovers them barking at a bookmobile, parked outside the kitchen at Windsor.  Entering to apologize for the din, the Queen meets Norman Seakins, a young man from the kitchen whose primary interest is in gay books and photography.  Feeling obligated to borrow a book, the Queen selects a novel, intending to return it the following week.  Almost immediately, palace life changes.  That night, with the president of France seated beside her at dinner, the Queen abandons her usual safe conversation and remarks,  \\"I've been longing to ask you about Jean Genet...Homosexual and jailbird, was he nevertheless, as bad as he was painted?\\"<br /><br />As the Queen expands her reading under the direction of Norman, she becomes less interested in day-to-day activities, even arriving late to the opening of Parliament because she forgot her book for the coach ride and had to have it brought to her.  She no longer keeps to tried and true conversational subjects (the traffic on the road to the palace), as she converses with the public and meets honored guests, and she finds people becoming confused and tongue-tied.  Dinner conversations no longer have the pleasant, easy-going atmosphere that once made invitations to the palace so memorable.  When these issues continue for over a year, the Prime Minister determines to take action.<br /><br />In this delightful novella, Alan Bennett (Beyond the Fringe, Talking Heads, and most recently, The History Boys), explores reading, writing, and their effects on our lives as he develops this imaginative and warmly humorous scenario.  Though the eponymous \\"uncommon reader\\" is the Queen, her reactions to her reading (and other people's responses to her as a result of her reading) are so true-to-life and so plausible that Bennett accomplishes a feat rarely even attempted--he makes the reader identify with the Queen and root for her success as a bibliophile.<br /><br />Bennett's humor depends on the fine line he creates between reality and absurdity, and his explorations into the absurd are so close to reality, or what we might wish reality to be, that the reader sees, ironically, the absurdity of reality itself.  As he posits an alternative \\"reading lifestyle\\" for the Queen, he makes the Queen seem human--and connected with her (reading) public in new ways.  Bennett keeps the humor low-key, evoking images which allow the reader to discover, unassisted, the ironies which are so hilarious throughout the novella.  And just at the point at which the reader might wonder how Bennett will ever end this wonderful romp, he surprises us with an absolutely perfect ending, which takes place on the Queen's eightieth birthday.  Like the dramatist that he is, Bennett knows exactly when to stop.  And does.

B000OCXMAE|2.0|If you are used to the old Linkin Park style and are familiar with any of their older CD's, this one will definitely shock you. When I first heard it, I couldn't believe how much they had changed. Change isn't always bad, but in their situation it is. Before, they were a unique band with very defined vocals and now they just sound like any other band. Very disappointing...
0780021967|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's movie version of John Buchan's \\"39 Steps\\" is a good example of how a movie director can take as his source material a novel and radically alter it to make it into a completely different kettle of fish. He added two important female characters, love interest, comic touches, a good musical score, and a denouement that is better than his source material. What do you do if you are Richard Hannay, and you bring a woman home to your apartment, and she turns out to be spy who ends up with a dagger in her back? After all, before bringing her home, he had warned her, \\"It's your funeral.\\"<br />Robert Donat is Richard Hannay, and Madeleine Carroll is the romantic interest. The movie was made while Hitchcock was still in Britain. Even then he was a playful witty moviemaker. The British music hall performer, Mr. Memory, a key player in the film was a Hitchcock addition to the Buchan story.<br />The black and white movie is suspenseful with its spies, chase scenes in the Scottish highlands, and its very resourceful hero. Later Hitchcock movies used the isolated and hunted hero, the ingenious amateur, who has to win over doubters (in this case, Carroll). The film doesn't seem dated and is well worth seeing.

0446677450|4.0|This is a great book as a starter to financial intelligence. You do not need to believe in everything he said, and you should not, but surely this is a great way to wealth.    Things that I don't like about this book:    1) Education is useless? Umm... I understand that the author feels very strongly about this issue, but belittling others because of his own failure does not add any credential to his claim.    2) So what do you do after you have so much money? Yes this is about teaching you financial intelligence, so you probably won't need that life value instilled. Still, an epilogue or end chapter talking about what's the point of making so much money will add depth to the author's chracter.    3) This is kind of paradoxical: If one way to generate wealth is via royalty, isn't what the rich dad poor dad doing now (e.g., think about the whole series). Do you actually need it?    Good for starters, but from there on you are on your own. This books inspires me in the sense that it teaches me to care about my personal finance and how to do so (in some simple ways), but life goes on and you have to figure out YOUR own way of style of investment / business. Good luck.  Edit this review
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Okay, I am giving this movie 5 stars without having viewed the '25th anniversary edition' as the movie itself is nothing less than a horror / fantasy masterpiece.  It was released in the summer of 1982 when \\"slasher flicks\\" were soaking up the screams at the local cinemas.  The genius of Poltergeist was that it managed to cram brilliant acting, awe-inducing visual effects, genuine laughs, gut-wrenching frights, and a truly classic musical score into 115 minutes of celluloid without ever resorting to being vulgar or cheap.  An impossible feat for today's horror movie standards.    I am confused as to why we have not seen any \\"Special Edition\\" version of this film.  Based on the information given regarding the 'special features' of this edition, I can totally empathize with any disgruntled fan crying out in frustration over the bare-bones treatment being offered.  Why are the studio(s) involved not putting any heart & soul into releasing a worthwhile \\"Special Edition\\" for the fans?  A scarier thought is that we're living in a era when every piece-of-crap film being released on DVD is packed with deleted scenes, 'making of' featurettes, cast & crew interviews, commentaries etc...     So, why not Poltergeist?

B00003CXWV|5.0|I just picked this up and saw it for the second time. I put it on my list due to my coming across an interview with George Jung in a book on the Drug War. Really, I'm surprised more people didn't love this one. How many more winning attributes can a film possess? It's based a true story about famous people with tons of action and great characters. Depp, of course, was superb, but Jordi Malla as Diego (really Carlos Lehder) is almost as good. The scenes of Escobar stood out as well. I would place this one in my second tier of mafia/action movies.
0143038419|3.0|The story is an easy read and an interesting journey...revelations abound and some interesting insight included. However, I was able to put the book down at least a half a dozen times and easily so through the first 50 pages. In fact, I nearly didn't continue due to the annoying reality that she would spend the entire book talking about herself, her thoughts, how she developed them and what she would do with them. Granted, it was a journey story about herself so this should be expected. However, it was extremely self-absorbed. More character development of friends/relationships and less I-this, I-that could have achieved the same results. The reader should have been trusted to intuit more instead of being spoon fed every thought/revelation.    With that said, one concept and one character saved the reading experience for me...her Texas friend (who nailed her w/every comment you wished you could have) and the notion that we should stop trying to abstain from all of our pleasures but, instead, try to rid ourselves of the gap between us and God. In doing so, we spend less time giving up (yielding resentment) and more time seeking (yielding pleasure and joy).    This book definitely has an audience and a place. Its intentions are honorable and will affect positive change in many readers. It is like a feel-good movie...easy, straight-forward, enjoyable but not outstanding, impressive, and unbeatable in its objective.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I wasn't a big Will Smith fan before seeing The Pursuit of Happyness but now I am. Here he gives an incredible performance as the quintessential good man who struggles to survive against random events which nearly overwhelm him (and would probably overwhelm anyone else). I just got done making a point about the movie Apocalypto which I will also make here. Movies like these fully reveal how silly we are to spend so much time obsessed with race, sex, and class in our society because no matter what your persuasion or ethnicity is most of us can easily relate intimately to those who differ from us when the circumstances necessitate it. In this film we cheer for Smith to succeed with all of our might. Our desire to see him make it is all-consuming.<br /><br />All of us, no matter what we look like, can relate to the character of Chris Gardner. The first hour of the film is almost painful to watch as we see a bright, capable, assertive man get beaten down by the vagaries of life. They called him \\"Ten Gallon Head\\" in high school because of how smart he was but most of the film is a testament to man's impotence and limitations when confronted with forces he cannot control. His intelligence does not even seem to matter. Gardner seems to \\"run bad\\" for 95 percent of the movie.<br /><br />Yet, his character and belief in himself are pervasively on display. He is a role model to everyone. Despite the disasters that keep punching him in the gut he refuses to quit. He refuses to accept defeat. He fights until...well, see the film. I bet you'll love the ending as much as I did. Yes, it is a tear-jerker but I was quite taken with The Pursuit of Happyness.

B0000524CY|4.0|this movie is wicked creepy. i loved it, it paved the way for all these other excorsism movies, but this one is definitly the best. the actors were great, the story was so believable, the makeup was good, and it was truly scary. not much can do that these days, but this one still can. a young innocent girls bodies possessed, killing her off slowly, making her do all these horrible things to herself. the mother helpless what does she do. her last resource the church. the priests who give their lives to help. the oldest battle in the book: good against evil. they must do all they can to save this little girl. all the while being taunted and lured by this demonic creature. excellent story and brilliant idea. from start to finish this movie was great. don't mess with things you don't understand. the head twisting scene: WICKED.

B000AP04OM|5.0|THE SOUND OF MUSIC is incredibly entertaining and incredibly effective despite the fact that it is incredibly hokey. THE SOUND OF MUSIC may actually be the source of all known hokeyness in the universe. Still, despite it all, this film leaves nuclear waste long-haul truckers and oil-rig wildcatters singing, \\"How do you solve a problem like Maria?\\" with a smile on their grizzled faces.<br /><br />There's a lovely innocence to this film that touches everyone who sees it. Julie Andrews as Maria essentially reprises her MARY POPPINS role as the magical governess who brings happiness to a houseful of lonely children being raised by an overly stern but loving father.<br /><br />THE SOUND OF MUSIC is more or less the true story of the singing von Trapp family who fled anschluss Austria to escape the overwhelming shadow of Nazism. Christopher Plummer plays Naval Captain Georg von Trapp, a rather benevolent despot of a parent who is mismanaging his children with brisk military efficiency when Maria appears. The new Nanny is a reluctant Novice at the local convent, sent out into the world by the Reverend Mother to measure her devotion to the cloister. She soon falls in love with the children and they with her. As Maria and the children bond, the Captain and Maria are drawn to one another. They eventually marry, and as the Germans occupy their country, they flee over the mountains to Switzerland.<br /><br />Most of the musical numbers in THE SOUND OF MUSIC have become true standards, including, \\"The Sound of Music,\\" \\"Sixteen on Seventeen,\\" \\"Do-Re-Mi\\" (AKA \\"Doe a Deer\\"), \\"A Few of My Favorite Things,\\" and \\"Edelweiss\\" (which is NOT the national anthem of Austria). Rodgers and Hammerstein contributed their best and last to the libretto. Musically, the 1965 movie varies somewhat from the 1959 stage play, but this only means there are more classics to be had in enjoying them both.<br /><br />Certain scenes have become classics in and of themselves: The opening scene of Julie Andrews flinging her arms and pirouetting joyfully on the slopes of the Unterberg is instantly recognizable. The chorus of smiling nuns is equally recognizable. The gazebo scene and gentle dance between the eldest daughter, Liesl and her boyfriend Rolf, still leaves the viewer with wet eyes. Plummer and Andrews' wistful last scene on stage in Salzbug is moving.<br /><br />Affection for this staid but singular film has led to it being often parodied (i.e., \\"The Sound of Murder\\") and picked on (viz., \\"The Sound of Mucous\\"), and it is awfully easy to goof on the dialogue and songs, but nevertheless, we keep coming back to it.<br /><br />When released, THE SOUND OF MUSIC became the top-grossing film of all time, and, inflation adjusted, it still stands in the top ten. The continuing popularity of this film is amazing, especially considering that four decades later the movie musical is all but dead. There are no dramatic special effects, no car chases, no explosions, no T & A, and not a foul word in this film. No doubt, this combination of elements accounts for its success. The political yahoos who grow fat on trumpeting \\"Family Values\\" could do more good by encouraging people to watch this film than by all the other anti-whatever they hypocritically babble about. Of course, that assumes they really believe what they're saying in the first place.<br /><br />THE SOUND OF MUSIC is true G-Rated quality family entertainment, an artifact of a gentler age.etting joyfully on the slopes of the Unterberg is instantly recognizable.

0618680004|5.0|I have recently read Hitchens' and Dawkins' book on   the non-existence of a diety and the follies of religion  one after the other.  Whlie Dawkins' writing does not  have the literary flair of Hitchens, I think he constructs  his arguments more carefully and convincingly.   While Hitchens' writings largely reflect his literary background,   Dawkins' arguments are at heart scientific.      Unfortunately, Dawkins' style is not only combative, but  also intrinsicly implies that anyone who disagrees is   either intelectually dishonest or a fool.  This will tend  to alienate many readers right at the outset.
B000U7169M|4.0|I am biased. I love Hilary Swank. Like Biblical thrillers. Impressed with great visual effects.<br />Two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank is a great actress, I believe given the right role, she will portray it to near-perfection. Her latest film, \\"The Reaping\\" is a Biblical thriller based on the 10 Plagues in the Book of Exodus. I'm assuming most, if not everyone has heard the story of Moses, if you did, then, you pretty much know what the film is about. The question is: What is the motivation for the 10 Biblical plagues?<br /><br />Plot synopsis partially derived from the back cover:<br />Katherine Winter, (Hilary Swank) a former ordained minister who lost her faith is now an occult investigator with the purpose of debunking modern \\"miracles\\" bringing a scientific explanation to superstition and exposing frauds. Events in a small town called Haven, Louisiana defies all scientific explanation. The 10 Biblical plagues are occurring in the same order as in the book of Exodus. Katherine's investigations uncover more questions, she finds that the plagues are linked to the murder of a boy and a young girl. Are they Harbingers of evil or something else? Time is running out for Katherine, as it turns out not just the town is at stake, but maybe creation itself..<br /><br />\\"The Reaping\\" has a very interesting premise, but the screenplay is far from perfect. To its credit, it does execute a lot more things RIGHT than wrong. Although, not wholly original, it has a lot of similarities to \\"Bless the Child\\" and \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", I have to say by going into a different direction by taking the time in character development, it succeeds in bringing a bit of mystery. The studio responsible is Dark Castle Entertainment, known for gory thrillers like the remake of \\"House on Haunted Hill\\" and \\"Ghost Ship\\". People who are expecting a fast-paced bloody horror film will be disappointed. Visually speaking, \\"The Reaping\\" has phenomenal special effects that surpasses most horror flicks, the EFX are realistically done, especially the \\"Locusts swarm\\", the visuals are very impressive. (I hated the cheesy EFX in \\"The Haunting\\" remake)<br /><br />As mentioned above, the film goes to a different direction. It ignores the blood and gore approach, it is more a tightly-wound thriller than a horror film. The direction by Stephen Hopkins could have done better with a lot less banter, but all in all, each main character is fleshed out a little more(even the townsfolk). Some may say it could have done without these factors, because the screenplay did divert into a \\"pointless\\" direction at times that it did have some dull moments but I rather thought that they were still necessary to liven the transition from each plague. After all, the plagues didn't happen overnight. Does \\"The Reaping\\" deliver as a thriller? Yes, but it did stumble a bit in that area. It is NOT an \\"edge of your seat\\" kind but rather it takes its time.<br /><br />As usual, Hilary Swank does a great performance. This movie would have failed miserably with a lesser actress in the lead, but Hilary passes with flying colors and does the best anyone can expect from her character. David Morissey and Stephen Rea both do a decent supporting performance.<br /><br />I saw the Warner Bros. Asian region-3 release, I think it would be safe to say the U.S. release will utilize the same transfer.<br />VIDEO/AUDIO: Anamorphic Widescreen. The transfer is flawless, very sharp and clean. Colors are radiant although a bit on the softer side. Black levels are very solid throughout. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is very powerful and suited for the film. I'm a DTS fan myself, but the 5.1 Dolby is not shabby.<br />Closing remarks:<br />\\"The Reaping\\" is not reinventing the suspense thriller genre, but with the strong performances of its leads, especially Swank, and the different approach it went with character development, it is worth a watch. The way it is directed may be a bit slow at times and the heavy-handed climax maynot be perfect, but the special effects together with the main premise kept me interested for the most part. It may not hold up to repeated viewings, but it is at least worth a rental for most people and gets a \\"Recommended\\" rating for those who like Biblical thrillers.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|Babel is a `six degrees of separation' film in which a single, small event in Morocco touches lives not only in Morocco but as far away as Japan, Mexico and America.  The traumatic stories unfolding at each location are otherwise unrelated to each other and are depicted in the very different styles of film-makers in those locations.  The result is like seeing three different, interleaved foreign movies based on the same theme--that horrendous events anywhere have the effect of stripping back the layers of falseness and irrelevance we build into our lives, leaving us with what is true and real.  I loved the multi-national backgrounds and thought the acting and direction were superb.  However, it's not a film for those looking for an uncomplicated story told in a familiar idiom.  It's demanding on several levels--a sophisticated, contemporary movie.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This cd took a couple of listenings for it to grow on me (altho why escapes me now - perhaps I was listening too much to the critics who hated it for the most part). This is definitely Coldplay's shining achievment thus far. While \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"Rush\\" were exceptional in their own right, this album has something that was slightly missing from the previous cd's: raw emotion. The music is pleasing to the ear but delves deeper into the psyche and evelops the listener.<br /><br />The comparisons to U2 are founded (except U2 are a far better band live) but as time will tell, Coldplay will definitely stand on their own as one of music's best!

006112429X|5.0|This book held my interest all the way through even though parts of it could have been a bit more condensed.  Kevin sent chills up my spine.  I found it very difficult to sympathize with his mother, but I also found it difficult not to examine my own style of parenting as compared to her style and her husband's.  I think the book was far superior to Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult.
006085880X|2.0|I read this based on the recommendations of friends (moms ages 35-43). I did not like it. I admit I wanted to find out what happened in the end, but I did not enjoy reading it. I was desperate to finish it so I could be \\"done\\" with it.  It is not just that the idea of a teen suicide is so painful to read about; it is that no one was terribly likeable in the book.  I didn't relate either to the teens or to the moms.  Also I found it not credible that the girl had never previously shown signs of depression.  Yes, I know that family and close friends can \\"miss signs\\" of suicidal tendencies, and that there can be no signs whatsoever, but it seems there usually are signs of depression.  Certainly the teen had reason to be disturbed and depressed, but the laying out of the story seemed neither revelatory nor explanatory.  I just don't like it.  Maybe it's better for a teen.
0316067598|2.0|I love a good nonfiction adventure story, and I was drawn to this book while walking through an airport.  I have nothing but respect for the soldiers in our military, and the author certainly endured a harrowing experience.      That being said, this book contained a painful amount of editorializing that can be boiled down to \\"Democrats Bad, Republicans Good\\".  It's the first time I've seen George Bush referred to as \\"a great leader\\" in print, anywhere.  If you can get through the first 90 pages of Republican chest-thumping, the actual chronicle of the mission is compelling and heartbreaking.  Unfortunately the story could have been told in half the number of pages and with a slightly less self-righteous political and world view.    The author's main complaint is that the liberal media scared he and his three team members from killing three unarmed Afghan goat herders in cold blood (one was a boy), because the rules of engagement (sponsored by the wimpy Democrats in the author's view) prevent it.  As a result the goat herders likely tipped off the Taliban to their presence and three of the four member team was lost (taking 50+ Taliban with them), in addition to several more soldiers in a rescue team.    There was no discussion about the wisdom of the mission itself, the quality of the intelligence reports that sent them into such a desparate situation, nor the impact on the non-Taliban population and what the author's thoughts were on those subjects.  Lots of flag-waving, but I would have preferred a bit more introspection and debate.    Overall a good read but frustrating editorial if you're not a dyed in the wool Republican.
0743298020|5.0|If you love mysteries or just like reading books about books, this debut novel is for you.  I wish to say that even though I am an avid reader, it has been a while since I have read a novel in less than 24-hours simply because I could not put it down.  \\"The Thirteenth Tale: A Novel\\" by Diane Setterfield is a gothic mystery about Vita Winter, a writer, and Margaret Lea, a biographer Ms. Winter's hires to write her story that she herself, Vita, cannot write.  The tales that are told and the things that happen in the present keep you glued to the page.      The book, in general, is about Margaret Lea, an amateur biographer, lives with her parents over her father's bookshop.  She is commissioned by Vida Winter, a bestselling reclusive author, to write Vida's biography.  Vida's challenge is that she must tell \\"the truth\\" because Vida has not done so in the past with other biographers and journalists.  Through Vida's storytelling, secrets are revealed.    Overall, this book is mesmerizing and craftily written.  The characters are well developed and all have an essential role in the plot development.  Setterfield's sense of imagery is outstanding.  She pulls you into the story as an observer looking through a magnifying glass so you can see the moors, the ghost, the fire, etc., using excellent scenery descriptions.  The ending brings everything to a close, and answers some nagging questions that most mystery writers sometimes forget that we, as readers, need.  Don't let the slow beginning stop you from reading further; it gets better.    For a debut novel, Setterfield has done an outstanding job and has written a literary marvel.  She touches upon themes of life/death, loneliness, love, betrayal, forgiveness, social morals, family, commitment to purpose and survival of the fittest in approximately 416 pages.  I await her next mystery novel.
B000J10ERO|5.0|This was the best of the Superman movies.  Brandon Routh was even better than Chris Reeve because there was no put-on of the character.  Routh will be going places. And Kevin Spacey's performance improves as you watch it.  The color and style update of the costume was needed and done well.  Kate Bosworth's Lois was weak.  Her husband was good. The special effects are very believable and flawless and beautiful.  This is a winner for all ages.
1596912855|4.0|Having read several reviews before reading Austenland, I was afraid that I'd be as disappointed with this book as other readers claimed to be. I had low expectations and read it simply because I have such respect for Shannon Hale's ability to tell a story well.     I loved it.    Set in the modern day, it's no Goose Girl and isn't brimming with the magical imagery and uniquely charming turns of phrase that fill Hale's fairytale/fantasy books. But Austenland is witty, well-crafted and kept me intrigued and curious enough that I stayed up until 2 AM to see how it would all play out--even though my boiserous children would be up knocking around the house at 6:30. (I don't stay up past 11 PM for just any book.)    There was nothing in Austenland to lead a careful \\"prude\\" like me to blush or cast the book aside. If you don't find \\"tight breeches\\" offensive, it's a safe read for you. No gratuitous sex or violence here--just a lighthearted romance with some diverting dialog and allusions to many favorite passages from Austen's Pride and Prejudice and scenes from A&E's irresistible adaptation.    Sure, if Austenland were a beefier novel, the characters could have been better developed and the ending could have dragged out a bit. But for its size, Austenland delivers more than I had expected. It was a very satisfying read--albeit mot mind-blowingly deep. Well worth losing a few hours of precious sleep. I'll probably even read it again.    Bravo to Shannon Hale for delving into a different genre.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|My single star rating is for the way this (and Planet Terror) are being released, not for the movies themselves.     I loved Grindhouse in the theater, and actually saw it multiple times during it's run. I was really looking forward to buying it on DVD, but I will NOT buy it like this. It's not that I didn't enjoy each movie independently, but a large part of what I enjoyed so much in the theater was the \\"double feature\\" experience of back to back movies, and the trailers between them. This is not the same thing.     If, and when, they release a combined version, I will happily buy all three versions, but this double-dip approach is a slap in the face to those of use who supported the movie in the theater.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I'll wait till they release the full grindhouse movie, not just death proof. It really sucks they are splitting the movies apart now
B00005JPLW|5.0|Who cares about how realistic a movie should be, this film is all about how legends were told to inspire others to stand fast and hold to what they believe in. This is what makes heroes. If you want a movie about realism, then this isn't for you, but if you, like me, enjoy allowing ourselves to dream, then this is a must see. The effects, music and atmosphere captures the legend that was spawned for this act. This is SPARTA!!
B000OQF6N6|3.0|First off, I'm not a wannabee music critic. What I am is a Pumpkin fan whom was mildly curious about the new cd. Here's my two cents. It's a good album. I would place it better than the Machina series, but not better than anything done prior to that. There are some \\"Pumpkin-esque\\" sounds, but it is new and that's not a bad thing. They can't keep doing the same music over and over - people would get sick of it. Anyway, the good is pretty darn good, just as the bad really sucks. Over all, I like the disk, but will probably call it quits on them after this.

0743496728|4.0|I fell headfirst into this book and didn't want to do anything BUT read it. I woke us this morning excited to read the last fifty pages. My heart ached for the the shooter and his parents as well as for the vicitms. Ninteen minutes took me behind first glance where characters are black and white and made them shades. I understood why those who still see black and white do so.   Well, I've finished those fifty pages and wish the ending was as finely crafted and held the answers promised in the body of the book. Sigh
1932907009|5.0|For years I've read books on structure and been intimidated.  I also really struggled with outlines as they seemed too linear for my way of thinking.  So, I wrote by feel which meant a lot of rewriting and wasted time.  \\"Save the Cat\\" was recommended by a coworker and he didn't steer me wrong.  The book lays out 15 beats of a story in a way that makes sense to me.  Since reading the book, I watch movies, TV shows and even story-oriented commercials to find each beat played out in the appropriate place.      The author, Blake Snyder also really stresses a solid log line and title before beginning to write.  I'm still struggling with this but have already made improvements and think I'll get there eventually.  It's a learning process.      The technique of using a bulletin board has allowed me to create an outline that is visual and therefore makes sense to me.  I've been working on a story, off and on for the past decade.  Since reading this book, I'm getting it laid out structurally and am thrilled to find it finally coming into focus.      If structure is your sticking point, or even if you just want to understand how good stories are built, I highly recommend \\"Save the Cat.\\"  I believe this book will finally allow me to improve my skills and take the next step in my career.
B000J10KTQ|5.0|Unlike some great movie sequels which brought in a heavy duty director so as to \\"save\\" the franchise or get it started again (ala Star Trek: Nemesis) and failed miserably because of a lack of knowlege about the franchise, Bryan Singer does a bang up job using old scores, old Marlon Brando film scenes, and keeps the dream alive about our hero from Krypton. The special effects, especially on HD DVD, are spectacular. One scene showing a crashing plane wherein Kal El attempts to stop the crash in mid-air, you can see the rippling of aluminum on the wings as Superman slows the plane's decent. This along with mind blowing audio on your 5.1 (or more) stereo system brings it right into your living room in a way that brings you into the movie unlike ever before. This is one of many such scenes where the latest tech in movieland is making the unbelievable seemingly realistic--or at least you want it to be real after watching it. The character portrayals by the \\"new\\" Superman actor and the rest of the cast were well chosen, and giving Brandon Routh a chance to show his stuff was a match made in heaven when it came to giving him the role. Remember, there was another actor who came out of no where to play the Man of Steel years ago who most of us had never heard of then, and from that point on we were convinced that a \\"man could fly\\". For that matter, too, God bless you Christopher Reeve, and we are glad that this dynasty of movies has been resurrected even as a tribute to your characterization of the Last Son of Kryptonn you shared with us so long ago.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Remy's a rat who idolizes a French chef named Auguste, and doesn't want to spend all his life eating garbage. Just from this we're introduced to probably the most adorable everyman since Forrest Gump. And while his Spirit-of-Auguste-driven adventures are definitely funny, even hysterical at times, the back-and-forth between the human characters may be a bit too highbrow for the kids to understand. Sad to say, a little girl no more than six fell asleep in my row of the theater. Alfredo Linguini is the young bistro apprentice who becomes Remy's partner in cooking, and truly competes with Remy for the film's most sympathetic character. Collette is an entertaining love interest for him, but the characters of Chef Skinner and Anton Ego(anyone catch the wordplay there?) are so over-the-top that it feels more like Pixar should send the Incredibles after them! Appropiately so, since both films were directed by Brad Bird, who surpasses himself for storytelling here. On the other hand, though Ratatouille is better than The Incredibles, it doesn't reach the comedic or heartfelt heights set by [[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars (Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00005JKDR Monsters, Inc. (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], and particularly [[ASIN:B00005JM02 Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]].<br />But comparisons aside, the film is a treat for older kids(particularly those who grew up watching Toy Story & A Bug's Life) and adults who don't mind animation. Some of the best parts are borderline spoofs of other Paris-set or kitchen-set films: Linguini & Skinner drinking in the office recalls confrontations of Clouseau & his superior in \\"The Pink Panther\\", and the Remy-Skinner chase feels like a comic sendup of \\"The French Connection\\", while Remy's rat colony taking over the kitchen is a brilliantly Disneyfied take on Henson's luncheonette-rats gag from \\"The Muppets Take Manhattan\\". Also, Remy's interplay with his Dad, brother Emile and friends are fairly comical, resonant and certainly give Remy the depth needed to make him a worthy hero.<br />All in all, Ratatouille may not be the best Disney & Pixar's had to offer, but even when their work doesn't blaze bright, the magic can still create a good sparkle. See it at least once!Remy the depth needed to make him a worthy hero.

B000GH3CVQ|4.0|I got interested in Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova after seeing \\"Once\\" at the theater. I purchased the soundtrack and really liked it.  The Swell Season features more of their creativity.  They harmonize beautifully.  Some of the songs are the same as the soundtrack but for me, it does not take away.  I hope they make more CDs together.
B00005JPRZ|3.0|My grandmother died in 1992.It was the first funeral that I had ever attended.A very different portrait of a woman that we all thought we knew VERY well surfaced most unexpectedly while at the get-together afterwards at my Aunt's house.Needless to say I was extremely surprised and a little more than shocked about what I had discovered about my dear old \\"Gaga\\".    Hence, we come to DEATH AT A FUNERAL,a ripping good time of a movie about a divided British family's attempt to send off in a dignified manner their beloved patriarch.What would normally seem to be a very easy thing to do turns into total chaos involving hallucinogenic drugs,sibling rivalries, romantic jealousies,wacky relatives,blackmail,murder attempts and a long held,unknown dark secret of the corpse.    Director Frank Oz seems to have returned to his British roots with DEATH and a truly first rate assemblage of NOW actors,but unfortunately brings with him some American  humor that simply betrays this funereal farce.When a European farce is reduced to \\"the gross-out factor\\" in order to secure a laugh, too much American influence has crept in.The scatology in this film cheapens what starts out to be very clever and wacky.That, though, is not the only problem with this film: Oz needs to know when one joke or line of comedy has run it's course and then move on.Much is dragged a little too far in order for it to continue to be funny.The film lacks a necessary focus to bring it full circle.Is the point of the film the secret of the corpse,the brother's rivalry, the blackmail attempt,or ultimately the conclusion of the eulogy? There are lots of great ideas in this humorous ride, but which one is the point of the film?     Where DEATH really excels as a work of art is in the truly smart and savvy editing;it is cut together magnificently and is worthy of mention alone.    WARNING: If a review gives away the secret of the corpse, much of the fun and suspense will be diminished!Unfortunately I had read such one and it DID affect the punch this film could have had.    Alan Tudyk really does steal the show with a comic turn as Simon, the mistakenly drug-induced lawyer.Matthew Macfadyen and Rupert Graves as the siblings do well enough as the foils in this farce, though I do prefer their dramatic work better.As always it is great to continue to see Peter Dinklage getting interesting parts in films, though to be a mere supporting character betrays his excellence as a lead dramatic actor.Still,all-in-all,DEATH AT A FUNERAL is a pleasing enough one-time view that does contain smart and witty repartee and enough laughs worth the time.    Excellent companion films would be MAY FOOLS (French) and to some degree THE CELEBRATION (French) and THE SEA (Icelandic).

1878424319|3.0|The premise of the book is delightful. The language tends toward the negative, the what is wrong, more than it focuses on the positive energy to bring about the desired shift. There is much value in the concepts and if you are guided to the message, you will hear it in the way that works best for you.
B00005JLWN|5.0|It looks like Matrix marked a new age for Sci-Fi movies by showing deep phylosophycal drama, fast paced action sequences, complex martial arts ballets and doomy/gloomy societies. Anyhow, if you want these ingredients in a sci-fi movie I invite to buy this one! The main plot exposes us to a very good human question as to whether will we be able to annihilate war by supressing our own feelings...Like or not, it is a valid point of view. Very good political view of a not-so-far future and a resistance which tries to gives us back our humanity. The fight sequences, thou not having the complexity of those of Matrix they are really good because they have martial arts and gun shoots everywhere. If you are also looking for very emotional performances take Bale's and Watson's lookings at each other. I highly recommended movie that I am totally satisfied of and if you are a good sci-fi fan just like me, go and get it!

0780622553|4.0|Among the questionining reality movies I just purchased Dark City and hell of a movie!! The plot takes us to a super doomy/glommy always-at-night city where a guy is chased by cops and some strange men who have the ability to alter time and the city itself into the reality they want and need. The matter is they are experimenting with human beings and there is only one guy who knows the truth (a bizarre performance by Kiefer Sutherland) This takes into not so deep philosophycal themes but good pace of twisted tricks and a climax totally unexpected (not telling you the end!!!) But if you like Matrix where ''external'' creatures are toying with humankind destiny and make you think what reality ''really'' is about then I highly recommend this to you. Go and get it, I did it and believe me, I am a sci-fi fan, so if you like it as much as I do you will not be disappointed!

B0000844I8|3.0|If you are a fan a Roland Emmerich movies then this is for you! If you like fast paced and interstelar with huge scale space battles then you may want to skip to another movie. I can tell you this: this was the Pre-Independence movie preview! Excelent production as you can expect! On a desert in Egypt some scientits find a huge ring and they try to find out what it is. A social loser but a genius in translating is cast to translate the symbols in the ring, which turns to be a stargate to a far planet where an alien has turn a human colony into slaves. Weak performance of Kurt Russel if you ask me. The movies runs slow alowing you to enjoy the dialogs and the landscapes. I think Emmerich was still trying to find his pace and the exact kind of movie he wanted to make. In the end this group of US soldiers defeat the alien liberating the human colony and our loser turned to saviour decides to remain in that planet. I can tell you this, if you are into alien ships,desert planets, soldiers dying in battle, innocent children turned to slaves and not yet so well developed drama then this one is for you. If you are a Roland E. fan just get it so you can see the evolution until the monumental Day after tomorrow came up!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Simply put, The Lives of Others is an unforgettable film.  It succeeds because it works exceedingly well on multiple levels - it's a nuanced character study,  poignant historical drama, tangled love story, LeCarre-like thriller, and  political parable all working together in an intricately-told tale that will resonate and stay with you long after the film is finished.  The cast of relatively unknown German actors is superb, particularly Ulrich Muhe, Sebastian Koch and the alluring Martina Gedeck.  While director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's directorial style and camera work are arguably a bit flat, he clearly is a name to remember and a force to be reckoned with in cinema.  If he continues to write and direct films as intelligent and mesmerizing as The Lives of Others he will no doubt rise to the upper echelon of global filmmakers.  Highly Recommended.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|This was a wonderfully acted and directed movie.   Many of were in the sphere of where the Zodiac killer was killing.  The movie indicates someone knew the killer and knows therefore that he is dead from a heart attack.  The rest of us are left in wonder.
B000J4QWMC|2.0|The movie Miami Vice may be great for fans of the series, but I wasn't one when I went into it. I like action films. I like Colin Farrell. I thought, why not? The answer: many many reasons. #1) Colin Farrell has a mullet and a Burt Reynold's style moustache that is so distracting I spent so much time lamenting its presence, I had a hard time grounding myself in the movie. #2) There is no way of grounding yourself in a movie that's about nothing. And it is. About nothing. No point. No plot. Just guns, nonexistent drug shipments, and bad accents. Lovely. #3) The movie didn't so much end as just cut off without any resolution.<br /><br />Can I please just have those two hours of my life back? Please, save yourself the time and money of renting this lackluster film.
1580086810|5.0|I heard about this book about 3 months ago as it was featured in Time Magazine.  I only wish I picked it sooner because it is fascinating. My 7-year old enjoyed discussing the finer points of eating in the United States.  She thought it was shocking that people in the world eat starfish, guinea pigs and bugs.  On the other hand, when we discussed our eating of beef and realized that a Hindu in India would never do that; the world seemed to get a little smaller.  The discussions about culture and food are so interesting.
1596912375|5.0|This is a spy novel, not a thriller, and there is a real difference between the two genres.  Think John LeCarre and Graham Greene, not Robert Ludlum and Ken Follet.  With the spy novel, you have the ever-so-slow peeling of layers, deeper characterizaion, a frequent sense of foreboding and, until all is revealed, some confusion.  The thriller, in contrast, is the page-turning, up-all-night, action-packed adventure that you can't put down.  After finishing a thriller, you are likely to say \\"where can I get another fix,\\" but not to reflect on what you have just read, and if you try, you may not remember and, if you do, it may not make sense.  With the spy novel, you may want to wait a while before reading another, but you will spend some time reflecting on what you've just read, and it provokes you in a more serious, literary way.         I like both genres but find it important to orient my expectations going in.         For the spy novel genre, Restless would have to rank among my favorites.  In addition to the terrific writing, the likeable-but-far-from-perfect heroines and the World War II intrigue, the novel offers some additional pleasures.         First, it is quintissentially British.  The book involves, among other things, a single mother raising her son, the world of Oxford academia, and all sorts of emotionally powerful events.  These all come across with the British stoicism, stiff-upper-lipism and \\"no winging (whining)\\" ethic that make the book very different from an American treatment of the identical plot.  Not better, or worse, just different and thus very interesting to the American reader.  The cultural difference (accurately renedered I should say) is a fascinating sidelight for the American reader.         Second, the author employed heroines rather than heroes.  I would be interested to hear from female readers, but I was very impressed with the author's ability to create characters of the opposite sex who seemed nonstereotyped, but true.  Thereis nothing of \\"the weaker sex\\" to the heroines, but they are not at all the same as they would be if written as men.  In short, they're real women (or at least seem so from my, male, perspective)in a genre that does not frequently offer that.         Third, the novel spends a great deal of time on the intrigue, spying and propoganda surrounding British efforts to persuade the United States to join World War II.  In an interview, Boyd says that he mostly used his imagination in creating the spying, but it certainly seems realistic and oh so relevant today.  The wheels-within-wheels manipulation of the media and public opinion and the \\"trust nobody\\" mantra say more about contemporary foreign affairs than many current nonfiction treatments, which themselves simply repeat the spin that interested actors have given the authors.       Enjoy.
0316018953|5.0|I thought the book was well written and suspenceful.  The characters were developed well. Since I had never read one of Michael Connelly's books, I am now looking for some of his other works.  The book had an interesting twist at the end as I didn't figure it out till I was right on top of it.

038572179X|5.0|I came to Atonement late, after having been disappointed by Ian McEwan's \\"Saturday.\\" In that book, the writing was good, but the characters were uninteresting and the plot slow. It left me cold. I wondered what the McEwan fuss was about.    Atonement, on the other hand, more than delivers. It's quite simply one of a handful of contemporary novels that I would call a masterpiece. McEwan uses language precisely, brilliantly, and without error -- like an etcher of delicate glass images. He creates characters that will live in your memory; his plotting is unusual and yet, when you've finished the book, inevitable. Atonement is a wonderful book.
0316776963|1.0|Let me start by saying I am a bibliophile and will sometimes buy a book just for the look of it.  I ended up throwing the book away rather than offer it to any one else. If I could have given this book something less than one star I would have given it a negative fifteen (-15).  I found this book gross, crass and inappropriate.  I've read books with strong language in them, but never like this one that has filthy language just for the sake of using filthy language.  I wouldn't have this book in my home and am sorry that I read the whole thing, but it was a private book club choice.  As it turned out no one else finished reading it.  DON'T BUY, READ or OWN THIS BOOK!
B000002WMH|5.0|If you're an Elvis Presley fan there is no need to go into the details of the music that gave birth to R&R - it's all here. Everything he recorded in the 1950s. If you were born in 1977 or later and only know of The King from hearsay, this box-set is a musical history lesson.<br /><br />Adding to the lustre of this wonderful collection from RCA Victor is the multi-page book containing numerous photographs, record label reproductions, including the Sun 78 rpm issues, all his LP/EP covers, poster reproductions, a complete 1950s discography, and reams of fascinating liner notes by Peter Guralnick.<br /><br />There is also an advertisement giving you a compete listing of Elvis videos, along with a sheet of 36 \\"collectable\\" stamps depicting his album covers.<br /><br />All in all, a marvelous collection which truly lives up to the adjective \\"essential\\" like no other.

Had heard all the talk of them having a very oi! sound mixed with hardcore and all the other post Opperation Ivy stuff as well but have to say, after just about 1 listen I was won over.<br /><br />This is pretty good.  Fast, loud and short is how this could best be described.  Mix in a few Oi! style chants and you have some damn good music here.<br /><br />Well worth buying.
078322933X|5.0|When FEAR slipped in and out of our collective consciousness in 1996 with all the impact of a school board election, the critics' near-unanimous cry of &#34;cheesy thriller&#34; was followed by the sound of the cineplex door hitting the picture on the butt as it made its way to oblivion.<br /><br />Well, yes, FEAR is a cheesy thriller, and it's also formulaic, cliched, hysterical and even downright silly. But all of that misses the point. Unlike most formulaic, cliched, hysterical and silly movies, FEAR has enough sex, swagger and thrills that you can still respect yourself in the morning after spending a lurid night with it.<br /><br />Like any charming piece of trash, Fear is best appreciated if you decide at the outset to give wholly in to it (a prospect which shouldn't, in and of itself, disturb anyone who thought Independence Day was a major work of motion picture art). Giving in to the movie isn't just a matter of accepting that it's a hokey cross of FATAL ATTRACTION and THE WILD ONE, though that is undeniably part of the fun. Nor is it just a matter of finding out whether underwear model Marky Mark Wahlberg can act (which he can, some). No, giving in to FEAR is a question of embracing the unthinkable, of considering the possibility that a remake of CAPE FEAR with Wahlberg in the Robert De Niro role and William Petersen standing in for Nick Nolte might actually be an improvement. Seriously. In large measure, FEAR is more satisfying than CAPE FEAR because Wahlberg is a more cuddly villain than De Niro and Petersen a less likable putz than Nolte.<br /><br />Where Nolte is dashing and able, Petersen is aptly wan as an architect whose career is accelerating a tad beyond his capacities, whose second marriage (to an innocuously cute Amy Brenneman) is crumbling, and whose teen daughter (Reese Witherspoon), the issue of marriage number one, is blooming sexually and increasingly eager to act on her new urges. Into this tenuous menage saunters Wahlberg, looking smashing as David McCall, a local hanger-out who's part altar boy and part psychotic. He literally seduces Witherspoon, and figuratively seduces her stepmom, her half brother and the family dog. Only Petersen, who understands David's predatory masculinity all too well, resists the guy's charms, and sets off a hair-raising rivalry, with Papa Bear trying to defend his little cub from the New Young Buck on the Block.<br /><br />Thankfully, FEAR glides along with a big dumb grin on its face, utterly unaware that it's about any such thing as male domination, and therein lies its appeal. This same blissful ignorance also makes Fear a better bet on video than it was a theatrical film. Go to a theater and watch Wahlberg stalk a suburban family and you might start wondering if someone's dosed your Pepsi; watch a Wahlberg film on video and realize that it's actually about something, and you feel pretty good about lying around the house in your sweats on a Saturday night. Don't get me wrong, of course. In the end, as Fear winds its way from moderately engaging psychological thriller to ludicrously over-the-top siege movie, you'll find yourself, howsoever absorbed, grateful not to have spent &#34;E&#34; ticket prices for what is little more than a mental kiddy ride.<br /><br />The fact that FEAR works as both pure cotton candy and intriguing horror show is attributable most of all to director James Foley, who's a frustrating talent as likely to produce silly camp (WHO'S THAT GIRL?) or ponderous contrivance (GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS) as chilling drama (AT CLOSE RANGE) or compelling pulp (AFTER DARK, MY SWEET). This time, he's generally on the mark. He's got an appreciative, voyeuristic feel for teenagers (look at his 1984 directorial debut, RECKLESS, an archetypical young-teen-on-bike-gets-laid movie, for a similar pattern), and in FEAR, Alyssa Milano is particularly piquant as Witherspoon's slutty best friend. But Foley's always been a guy's director with a knack for getting performances from young leading men: Sean Penn, Aidan Quinn and Jason Patric have all done solid work with him, and he gets some real moments out of Wahlberg (who has since stunned the world with further evidence of acting talent starting with BOOGIE NIGHTS and culminating in an Oscar nomination for THE DEPARTED. Go figure!)<br /><br />So, sure, give in to FEAR for 90 minutes or so of cheap pleasure, but don't expect it to be anything more than what it looks like: a Mark Wahlberg movie. Which isn't so much to say that it sucks as to register surprise that there's as much good in it as there is.ason Patric have all done solid work with him, and he gets some real moments out of Wahlberg (who has since stunned the world with further evidence of acting talent starting with BOOGIE NIGHTS and culminating in an Oscar nomination for THE DEPARTED.

B0006SSOHC|1.0|Yes, this is simply nothing more than mind rot at its most blatant! There is no plot, no psychology, no suspense, just gore-gore-gore-and MORE gore just for the sake of showing gore. And to think this film not only is a 'hit', but it has spawned sequels. Now, that to me is psychologically frightening, a lot more scarier than this film (or its sequels) could ever dare to be. If I wanna see someone being tortured, I'll visit youtube and watch some Iraq footage or something, but I really don't prefer to view someone being tortured just for shock value.<br />I advise anyone with any common sense of decency to stay as far away from these trash 'snuff-porn for dummies' films as possible. They are a plague on our country, and people are sitting in theaters eating them up as they are eating their popcorn and being told 'this is ok to watch', brainwashed like mindless sheep. Treat this crap like AIDS or Typhoid Mary, for it is liken to a very scary virus that's overtaking theaters in place of what used to be great cinema.<br />I just read someone reviewing \\"Hostel part 2\\" saying that Hitchcock would love it. HUH??? REALLY???! What drugs are these people on to even remotely try to compare this garbage to anything Hitchcock???! He wouldn't even watch such crap, let alone applaud it. And the same goes for Jonathan Demme (the director of the classic \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", another film these 'fans' are comparing this crap to).<br />Don't get me wrong, for I believe everybody has the right to form their own opinion, but these type of films were hidden from sight and concidered illegal just 20 years ago, and now they are being paraded from theater to theater with pride. What the h*ll happened to our society???<br />If I wanna see someone digging in a toilet, I will watch a plummer working, that would be more entertaining than this trash anyday.<br />And, since I prefer my horror films to be psychological, I will steer as far from this as Humanly possible, and I advise the same for any other intelligent/intellectual film goer out there. Thank you.nt/intellectual film goer out there. Thank you.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Like witches before a cauldron, author Anne Rice and her minions chanted, \\"Who shall play Lestat? Who shall play Lestat?\\" Rice's incantation conjured up such names for the casting of this high-profile role as Alexander Godunov, Cher and Peter Weller, who probably had scheduling problems anyway doing films like THE NEW AGE and cable movies with actors like Robert Hays. Then, director Neil Jordan announced Tom Cruise would play the tall, blond European vampire -- it was as if he had uttered Richard Grieco -- and the realized film was reduced to an assessment of Cruise's Lestat. What everyone missed, while hanging on to Tom's every \\"mon Dieu,\\" was Jordan's ability to turn a novel with a flaccid film premise into something worth watching.<br /><br />INTERVIEW is not the greatest idea for a movie -- the dozens of aborted screenplay attempts and the 17 years it took to finally reach the big screen are evidence enough -- because it's neither suspenseful nor scary. Because it is told through the eyes of a vampire, we are asked to identify with a predator. We stalk the helpless. We don't feel frightened, we feel guilty. The examination of a sourpuss lamenting his fate for two centuries may make for good reading, but the idea doesn't exactly put you at the edge of your seat. Vampire movies told through the eyes of the predator are best-suited for comedy, as in Love at First Bite -- well, maybe not best-suited -- or metaphor, as in The Hunger. So what about Interview? Jordan said, \\"What fascinates me about [the film] is the absence of moral responsibility.\\" Well, he's hinting at the truth. For our money, Interview is about the torment of being a celebrity.<br /><br />Brad Pitt says, \\"I'm flesh and blood, but not human.\\" Pick a star, any star. Christian Bale? Nicolas Cage? Flesh and blood, sure. But human? Pitt's tale reads as that of a celebrity thrust into the limelight searching for the secrets of how to be a headliner. Cruise, the biggest superstar in town, chose Pitt as his lifetime co-star -- for his beauty? Definitely. Because he owns a sprawling plantation? Couldn't hurt. The pretty boys live the high life, but Pitt can't snip his ties to the little people and so resorts to common junk food binges. If Cruise has any tricks on handling fame, he's sure as hell not sharing them with the whiny, I-don't-want-to-be-a-star Pitt; so he figures to shut him up by biting him a gift -- child actor Kirsten Dunst. This is Cruise's fatal mistake, for he should know better than to have a kid for a co-star. Just ask W.C. Fields or anyone who had to share screen time with Macaulay Culkin.<br /><br />As with most child stars, Dunst's fans won't let her grow up. When she lops off her trademark locks in hopes of changing her image, those precious curly Q's just grow back -- Shirley Temple forever. This clearly explains why Zac Efron won't be seen in NATURAL BORN KILLERS II anytime soon. But then Dunst does what child stars do best: she upstages the headliner. With Cruise out of the spotlight, Pitt is forced to carry the burden of fame on his own. He decides he needs guidance. So why not go to Paris?<br /><br />In Paris, Pitt finds his counselor in the form of Antonio Banderas, who appears to have been a big deal in his day but now hosts a lame television show -- metaphorically speaking, of course. Banderas tells Pitt, \\"You have to be powerful, beautiful and have no regrets.\\" (Is he referring to Sharon Stone?) Being a show-biz veteran, Banderas has the good sense to can the child actor, cancel the TV show and jump-start his career with the new hot star, Pitt. Although coming very close to kissing Banderas, Pitt won't have this has-been riding his coattails. So, he's off yet again, this time to America.<br /><br />Back home, Pitt catches a foul aroma only celebrities can smell -- the scent of a dead career. He follows the stench to find Cruise in the Jon Voight Home of Former Leading Men. Cruise pathetically recalls his salad days, forcing Pitt to fleebecause failed stardom is catchy. Still somewhat of an ingenue when it comes to fame management, Pitt fails to take into account the possibility of the ever-elusive comeback. Too bad Travolta wasn't around to tip him off. Interview ends on the hopeful note that anyone can return to glory once more -- Kevin Costner, Burt Reynolds, The Two Coreys... (well, maybe not anyone.)<br /><br />While there are plenty of films about celebrities -- Sunset Boulevard, A Star Is Born -- none get deeper in the skin, or more inside the head, of the immortal superstar than Jordan's INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.somewhat of an ingenue when it comes to fame management, Pitt fails to take into account the possibility of the ever-elusive comeback.

B00008OLYN|3.0|I knew what I was buying when I bought this album. However I didn't know how mediocre it would be. I was expecting better song writing first of all. This album came at the same time as Deliverance (which also was just \\"ok\\") came and Opeth know how do make dynamic music, but this album starts with the best song and never quite gets close to it again. I honestly only like two or at good days three songs on this album. If they're gonna make a new acoustic album they hopefully will put as much effort into it as they do with their metal albums. This first sounded like the best idea from them so far, but there's about a billion better albums out there with progressive influences on them. Opeth are good, but they're not fantastic yet..they probably will become THAT good one day..but so far they're not there yet.

American women today owe such a debt to pioneers like Mamah Borthwick, who fought for a woman's right to \\"freedom of personality,\\" beyond just the right to vote. I had no inkling about the tragedy that occurred and it certainly took me by surprise. What a great book, Nancy Horan did a fabulous job.

It is about giving oneself a firm foundation from which to soar.  What good is deathless prose if no one ever reads it?<br /><br />The introduction alone was enough to give me a valuable new perspective on writing.  And on the subject of writing, Mr. Lukeman is no mean writer in his own right.  There is nothing pompous or authoritarian about The First Five Pages; there is instead an air of friendly advice.  In Mr. Lukeman's own words, \\". . . all I can say is that if you walk away from these pages with even one idea that helps you with even one word of your writing, then it's been worth it.\\"<br /><br />Believe me, it's worth it.

In Wendover (aka Werner Field), that's what it really looks like.

0783235380|2.0|Forces of Nature is probably my least favorite film of Sandra Bullock's career. There's nothing wrong with her performance, she is funny and brilliant as always but to me Ben Affleck's wooden acting ruined this so-so film. There are parts of this film I like and parts I do not. The film has a week premise and never takes float, the ending is disappointing and the writing is sloppy. If you want a great Sandra Bullock film then check out 28 Days or Practical Magic, leave this one on the shelf.

Kevin Specey is the villain taken directly out of the comic book but his character is spiced up both by his acting as well as the script.   However Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) is quite flat and, at least in this movie, does not justify Superman's feelings towards her.    The directing is decent. Sole exception is that in the airplane flight  in the beggining of the film she gets bounded around quite badly (an average person would have being killed) yet she emerges without a scratch or broose and her hair is perfectly combed while the rest of the women in the scene are all messed up.    All in all it is not a bad film with an excellent picture quality.
0553588486|4.0|so far!  I am excited to read the next three books. Instead of expounding on the virtues of the novel, I would like to address two common complaints that one finds in these reviews.  Firstly, the reports about sex/incest/bestiality are vastly exaggerated.  There is ONE incestuous relationship between atomic family members, and the sexual description is limited to less than a paragraph.  Certainly, the novel mentions other kinds of incest, such as the marriage of first and second cousins, but that is to be expected where royal families are concerned; and sexual acts regarding these are never described.  Also, in line with medieval societal norms, there are a few ultra brief descriptions of sex involving teenagers; girls in royal families were frequently married off early and were expected to produce as many male heirs as possible.  Yes, there are several moderately explicit scenes of rape (especially near the end of the book), violence and sex, but they pale in comparison to many other historical fiction novels.  Sexual descriptions are about on par with an Anne Rice novel, and way softer than any of that romance/Fabio-on-the-cover drivel.  If you cringe at the slightest graphic description of violence, then I would stay away from anything that involves the history of humankind.  Certainly avoid the Conan and Warhammer 40K fiction series, and you should retain your sanity (and wimpiness).<br /><br />Regarding complexity:  this first book is EASY to follow.  Each chapter is titled with the name of the character from whose point of view the story will be narrated.  There are only eight such characters.  If you have trouble keeping everything in your head, just go back to to the previous chapter with the same character name and re-read the last few paragraphs...it's that simple folks.  I like this style because at several points, as you might find on TV or in the movies, the author leaves you hanging with some suspense at the end of the chapter until he \\"cuts\\" back to that (possibly concurrent) point in the story.<br /><br />Anyway, my opinion is no more valid than that of anyone else on Amazon.  If you like historical fiction, then I think there's a good chance you will like low fantasy.  This series is as good a place to start as anywhere.  Use some common sense:  first, take it out of the library if possible.  Second, read as many chapters as it takes for you to get a sense of the style and characterizations.  Third, if you don't like it, STOP READING...it will NOT get better.  I hereby deliver a VIRTUAL SLAP to reviewers who claim that they read the glowing reviews, read all 806 pages of the novel, and then felt debased or felt like they wasted their time or money...this is the United States, a playground of choices.  If you don't like something, change the channel or turn off the device!sibly concurrent) point in the story.    Anyway, my opinion is no more valid than that of anyone else on Amazon.

0140366725|5.0|Treasure Island is the first greatest pirate story of all times.  The young and brave Jim Harkins, the scary but honorable Long John Silver, the smart and solid Doctor Livesey.  Frankly I could go on and on listing interesting characters, major or otherwise, but let me just say that, having never before read the novel, I totally enjoyed it.  It has everything, from a blind beggar to a treasure map to drunken pirates, a parrot, and lots of plotting.  Who is with the good guys?  Who is with the bad guys?  Who is out for themselves?  Read and see.
B0000DZ3DR|4.0|This is a \\"must have\\" for Gene Clark afficianados; Carla Olson is an acquired taste whose voice sometimes seems to clash with Gene's. There are some absolutely brilliant performances such as \\"Del Gato\\" and \\"All the Fair and Tender Ladies.\\" For a real treat and an insight to Gene's genius, get a copy of \\"No Other\\" - easily one of the best albums of all time.
B000R9J3X4|5.0|Absolute Garbage is a great and multi-layered greatest hits album from my favorite band, Garbage of course. It contains all their radio hits, remixes, and one new track, Tell Me Where it Hurts, it's a gorgeous and sensual song, I love it! Hopefully the band will record a fifth album one day but for right now, Shirley Manson is working on a solo album so in the meantime,  we have Absolute Garbage to swoon about. Mostly I hate remixes but Garbage has the best and most accesible remxies I have ever heard. Standout tracks from the album cuts include: Vow, #1 Crush, I Think I'm Paranoid, It's All over but the Crying, and Cherry Lips. If you are a die-hard fan of Garbage then get this for your collection, I also recommend the dvd version which includes their innovative videos and footage of the band over the past 12 years.
0143038419|2.0|I have to agree with the reviewers who said they weren't wowed by this book.  It was recommended to me by two friends who claimed it was the best book they read all year but I knew I was going to be disappointed as soon as the author said she wouldn't discuss the reasons for her marital unhappiness and eagerness to rid herself of her husband and, without taking a cleansing breath, fall into the arms of another lover.   When he couldn't abide her neediness (which she described in the book's best line as \\"somewhere between a golden retriever and a barnacle\\"), she took her publisher's advance and went off to find God.    So Ms. Gilbert went to Italy and ate lots of pasta.  So she went to an ashram in India and learned to meditate.  So she went to Bali, hit up all her friends back home to raise $18,000 in seven days so her healer friend could buy a house (which only made me think about how many starving children could have had school supplies in seven days), and found an older lover who, knowing which buttons to push, apparently allowed her to end her spiritual journey by finding good sex.      I have to wonder about those readers who found the author's search for God enlightening and life-changing. What makes them (or the author) think the meditation-induced trances were conversations with God?  Maybe they were nothing more than simple states of mental serenity.  Maybe they have more issues than any book can meet.  I think the publisher who expected a travel book was robbed but those readers who enjoy this kind of thing are making the publisher loads of money anyway.

B000P6R6X8|5.0|Wilco's Sky Blue Sky has a 1970s feel to it.  Music aficionados may hear a little Steely Dan, John Lennon, and Neil Young, and other various musical influences within each track.  However, the sound hearkens back to the band's previous albums, A.M. and Being There as well as a little folk-like renderings that are reminiscent of the the band's collaboration with Billy Bragg on the Mermaid Avenue recordings, and the songs are more melodic and less experimental than what was heard on A Ghost Is Born and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot; in essence, the sound is raw and stripped down, and less of a big production.<br /><br />Sky Blue Sky has a mix of musical styles.  From the folk-like \\"What Light\\" and the title track, \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" to the impeccable guitar-work on \\"Impossible Germany,\\" listeners will get a good sample of how Wilco' musical style has matured.  And worth noting, \\"Please Be Patient With Me\\" is one of the beautiful sounding tracks on the record, musically and lyrically.  Indeed, this album shows how the band's sound has developed.<br /><br />In addition, the special deluxe edition of the CD contains an interesting DVD, which shows a live performance by the band at their Loft Studio, interviews of the band members, and background information about the production of Sky Blue Sky.  The live performance is impressive, and a few of the live versions sound better than the studio recordings, \\"Impossible Germany,\\" \\"Walken,\\" and \\"Hate it Here.\\"<br /><br />All of the songs on Sky Blue Sky has a listen while you drive feel.  Therefore, this edition of the CD is recommended for listening.  However, the DVD should not be viewed while driving.
0374105235|5.0|What Ishmael went through in 5 years is beyond belief.  Being a child soldier high on drugs and with weapons, takes away all humanity, and killing and torturing another human being is as easy as tying your shoe.  Before becoming a soldier, he was in constant fear of death from other soldiers and witnessed many deaths.  As a drugged up soldier, he no longer feared death or pain, but dealt it out instinctively and without thinking about it in a purely primal survival mode.  How anyone can be rehabilitated from that is truely remarkable.
B00005JKED|3.0|Upon first seeing Training Day, I was disappointed especially seeing Denzel Washington playing the character of corrupt cop, Alonzo Harris (which he portrayed exceedingly well). His performance was so convincing one finds oneself being revolted by his portrayal. However, there was something that always brought me back to this movie, seeing it three times over. On my fourth viewing of the DVD, I listened to Antoine Fuqua's directorial comments of the film, and I was able to appreciate the film to a greater depth.     The story itself is a study of the seduction of ambition and what one will compromise regarding personal morals in order to fulfill it. From the beginning of the movie at Jake Hoyt's residence, Jake comments to his wife about the possible advancement in the force this new position will bring and the material comfort it can provide his family. Before leaving his home and thus beginning his first day of training, his wife warns rather than encourages Jake not to screw up. Such comments sting the conscience of any one who seeks to provide the best for the family and one can sense the shame of past failures embedded in such a statement, making it all the more important that one will do what it takes to make it work. Picking up on Jake's enthusiasm and eagerness to please, Alonzo Harris, the veteran cop assigned to train Jake toys, manipulates, and pushes him beyond his own boundaries, and manages to force Jake to cross the line in order to prove himself.     Alonzo himself though has crossed that line long before. When visiting the home of a drug dealer whom Alonzo has built a working relationship with, he comments on how naïve and ignorant he was as Jake is now when he first started. Later on we see Alonzo seeking audience from three of his corrupt superiors, and it is he who becomes docile seeking to impress those whose worlds Alonzo aspires to enter.     Altogether Training Day is a hard-hitting, thought provoking film that is extremely well acted and directed. The one point where the movie seems improbable is the bath tub scene, but it is through Antoine Fuqua's commentary that this turn of events is given some credibility to the scene.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|My God ...<br /><br />That was the first coherent thought to go through my mind after I started watching this DVD.  The next 3 words were:  Beauty, Elegance and Class.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Lorrena McKennitt's music for some time.  I suppose it was a combination of her ability to find common themes throughout the world, her beautiful voice and her ability to weave in the use of \\"unusual\\" instruments.  Yes, I'm well aware that as a man from the Midwest USA \\"unusual\\" is a pretty wide term ... please bear with me.<br /><br />My first taste of her live material came with \\"Share The Journey\\" which is my favorite of her CDs ... well, WAS my favorite.  :-)<br /><br />I am finding more and more in common between Lorrena's music and that of another old favorite of mine; Dead Can Dance.  Both use Celtic and \\"Eastern\\" styles in their music and I feel \\"Nights from the Alhambra\\" to be a less-gothic cousin of DCD's \\"Towards The Within\\".<br /><br />The video of this live performance (for me anyways) falls somewhere inbetween the solemn theatricality of Peter Gabriel's \\"Secret World Live\\" and the near-grandeur of Yanni's \\"Live At The Acropolis\\" ... with a bit of Dead Can Dance thrown in.  ;-)<br /><br />\\"The Mummers' Dance\\" (still my favorite) showed that while the themes the band generally work with are grand they can still have an awful lot of fun.  \\"Penelope's Song\\" widened my mind a bit more to the feelings my girlfriend has about us being 2 time zones away from one another and is a wonderful companion to my girlfriend's favorite; \\"Never-Ending Road\\".  Those 2 songs also gave me the peace of mind and openness of heart to ask her to hold my heart carefully until we are together.<br /><br />Another wonderful feature of the video is the constant energy and talent playing between violinist Hugh Marsh (fantastic!) and the classically beautiful and very talented cellist Caroline Lavelle.<br /><br />While I personally do not find Loreena a \\"classic beauty\\", during and after my watching of \\"Nights from the Alhambra\\" when I see her sing a beauty is always evident ... throw in her smile and laugh and I feel pure joy!  It is that beauty that she presents with such elegance and carries with the class I'm beginning to believe perhaps only a woman can provide that makes this an experience I can't help but recommend to any lover of music.<br /><br />When it's all said and done, it was 1 hour and 38 minutes that passed like a float down a calm river ... and all too quickly.auty is always evident ... throw in her smile and laugh and I feel pure joy!

B000F3T3E6|5.0|The 22 year old Handel's \\"Il Trionfo...\\" is an amazingly early effort in the oratorio form, made necessary at least in part by the Church's injunction against opera.  It has movement, interplay of ideas and music, in one fine solo, duet or ensemble piece after the other. Like his later oratorios, Messiah excepted, it has considerable impact, though the story line is hardly dramatic in nature.  It is Handel's genius that makes it work so well, giving the individual parts distinctive character and variety.  Moreover, has anyone written more felicitously for the human voice than this composer, and he did most of it in his second and third languages?    Under the sure hand of Emanuelle Haim, the performance has, to my ear, fine pace, which helps bring out the best in both the four singers and the instrumentalists, and the latter are far more than just accompaniests.  Perhaps Natalie Dessay lovely and precise singing of the Bellezza role should be singled out among he vocalists, but the other three -- Ann Hallberg as Piacre, Sonia Prina as Disinganno and Pavol Breslik at Tempo -- are fully up to the damands of their parts, and these demands are large.  In contrast with his other oratorios, there is no chorus.    \\"Il Trionfo\\" is a Handel work that deserves to be hard more often, particularly when in the hands of such accomplished musicians.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|excellent movie! It is a great movie and should be an Oscar winner in any year except the one with Forest Gump. It includes no woman---the story between only men. It's not only about escape from the prison, but about human life in all kinds of conditions.
0743496728|3.0|Jodi Picoult has always been one of my favorite authors, but the last couple of books I've read from her just aren't the same.  This one got me into it and then the ending just fizzled out.  I skimmed the last few pages because I was just so disappointed.  She doesn't connect to the characters like she used to either.  In this one, it seemes like she was so focused on making a twist ending that she forget to develop some other key elements that would lead up to that moment.  I want her to go back to where she really cares if the reader connects to the characters in the book.

I know this won't outsell Meteora, but it probably will put them well on their way to making what could in all probability only be another garbage album. In any case, progress usually is a good thing, but perhaps Meteora 2 would be the best bet for Linkin' Park.  And just a side thought, am I the only one who thinks Chester went from a semi-normal looking person to looking like an absolute douchebag?  Seen the video?  Yeah, I thought so.

B00005JPLW|5.0|One of the best action film adaptations ever.  Certainly of the 21st Century. Excellent casting,  plot, cinematography, CGI etc.  I highly recommend taking a look at the special features to see what these guys went through to train for the film.  I was convinced that their muscles where digitally enhanced or supplemented by a suit of some sort.  Not the case... they are actually ripped and did their own stunts/fighting.  My wife (who normally isn't interested in any kind of gory action flick) was genuinely entertained.  Even if the history is exaggerated (that history being hundreds of years of oral history before being captured in print), what an inspiring story.
B000002P5R|5.0|Great CD. If you like Jimi you must buy this disk. Very good music from a very good artist.
B000QXDED6|5.0|Visually-stunning, like the critics said. Also an important movie depicting a history-defining battle in ancient Greece.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I was super-skeptical about Muse, having only heard the overplayed hit \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" (which is a great song, just way overplayed on Alt Nation).  After hearing that song a few hundred times, I thought Muse was just a one-hit wonder and a little too synth-pop for my taste.  However, I heard Knights of Cydonia once, and decided to pick up the album.  So glad I did!  Now, Muse is on my list (along with Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, The Doors, Pink Floyd, and a small number of living bands) as at least a potential All Time Favorite - another 2-3 albums like this one and they will cinch that spot for me!       Fast paced, soaring, \\"big\\" music.  Reminds me of The Moody Blues at their very best (and I am a huge fan of the Moody Blues!).  Muse has a style somewhere in the triangulation among Pink Floyd, The Moody Blues and Emerson Lake & Palmer; but of course they are talented and it would not do them justice just to say that alone.  So many good songs. I strongly recommend listening the the album from start to finish - like Pink Floyd, Muse's music hangs together as a whole and individual \\"radio\\" hits are more enjoyable as part of the hole.  Having said that, Starlight and Knights of Cydonia are fantastic, definitely my \\"turn it way up\\" favorites on the album.    Buy this CD!!!

It tells of your typical 'poor girl on wrong side of tracks, meets upper crust boy'...and it shines!  Molly Ringwald is exquisite in her roll.  McCarthy and Cryer, too, are very real and authentic in their roles.

0142501123|5.0|Just like The Gruffalo, the Gruffalo's Child and The Snail and the Whale books, this is a great one! My 4 and 2 year old girls love the story since it lends itself for being read outloud with sounds and different voices...

B000BB1MIC|4.0|The show is more of what I've come to love about the Gilmore Girls.  A lot happens this season that keeps you on the edge of your chair.  I was disappointed to see the \\"Gilmoreism\\" booklet that has accompanied the previous box sets was missing.  Instead, it was replaced by a flyer that directs you to a website to find definitions.  It seemed a little cheap when compared to previous season box sets.  Otherwise, another must have box set for fans of the show.

Non stop action, pissing people off, car chases, train wrecks, 18 wheeler wrecks--what fun on a huge, huge budget that can bring a hollywood movie, and CGI of course, all the way up to an A+. Justin Long, (Jeepers Creepers) plays a computer geek who is John's sidekick throughout the movie.(good job-he is funny) The bad guy --- a psychopath dressed in black with no sense of humour.
B00011RPB0|5.0|This is one of Bill Murray's finest performances on film.<br /><br />Whoever made the decision to shoot in Tokyo (the Director's, one can only assume), it was a brilliant choice. No city in the world can compete with Tokyo in terms of nighttime lights and the fresh sparkly cleanliness of its streets. Add in the language barrier, the Japanese, their cuisine, great photography, great direction, great acting, and finally, a terrific script, and you have a masterpiece.<br /><br />Lost In Translation truly makes you feel lost---lost in time really. Sofia Coppola's use of the clock while filming native scenes accompanied only with ambient noise is a mighty tool of provoking deep thought in the viewer. Truly it must take guts to consume precious film with such shots, else more directors would utilize the method.<br /><br />No two better suited individuals than Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson could have been lobbied to fulfill the lead roles. Murray has like, somehow, escalated multiple levels here in connecting with an audience. Maybe he had it inside of him all along, I don't know. Regardless, I am nearly brought to tears watching him. Here's a fellow who is nearly 60 years old, and yet, the most amazing inner talent is just now being revealed to us. What a treasure.<br /><br />Ms. Johansson plays the perfect newlywed here---being left alone in a strange city by a self-absorbed husband who doesn't appreciate what he has. Charlotte and the middle-aged Bob Harris (Johannsson and Murray) happen to fall into each other's path at one of those cosmic moments of doubt when both are unhappy with their home life.<br /><br />The gold brick of this entire encounter is cast when they appear together lying on a bed. It must be seen and heard to believe; it is one of the finest performances of its kind ever filmed IMO---Hence the subject line of this review. If you do not connect with this scene, then you are either unable or have yet to experience such a moment in time. It is the height of goodness that a human could possibly feel in such a place.<br /><br />This is a Fabulous Movie.
B000MZHW40|5.0|It is hard not to have some sympathy with the current trend of making political issues palatable by grafting a star and a story on to a real-life cause for concern. Give us a thrilling story, good acting, pretty people to look at, and we can get the message out to millions. In recent years, Nicolas Cage has tackled gun-running ( Lord of War) and George Clooney the Middle East ( Syriana). Now it's the turn of DiCaprio and the illegal diamond trade, which has funded civil wars in Africa.<br />Very good movie......
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I've listened to Rush on and off since one of my best friends introduced me to the band when I was in high school. My friends were impressed by the vocals of Geddy Lee and the guitar skills of Alex Lifeson. For me, I was amazed by the percussion skills of drummer Neil Peart. Over the years Rush has gained and lost favor in the public eye, but has largely maintained a steady and popular following. They are a group of musicians who have a very distinct style, yet aren't afraid of exploring new territory and have been constantly progressing since their first album.<br /><br />Besides the percussion, the other thing I really enjoy about Rush is how deep their lyrics are. Rush's songs are full of literary allusions, philosophical questioning, and thoughtful meanderings. Peart writes many of the lyrics for the songs and though he comes from an agnostic and humanistic starting point, e.g. &#34;The Larger Bowl&#34; on SNAKES & ARROWS, many of the lyrics of their songs can be identified by a searching for Truth.<br /><br />&#34;Far Cry&#34; is the opening song on the album. This song seems the most refined of all the tracks and is getting some airplay on radio stations as the lead single. Musically, there are some impressive bits on the track, but I find the song one of the weaker tunes on SNAKES & ARROWS. The songs I enjoy most are:<br /><br />&#34;Armor and Sword&#34;<br /><br />&#34;The Main Monkey Business&#34; (Instrumental)<br /><br />&#34;Hope&#34; (Instrumental)<br /><br />&#34;We Hold On&#34;<br /><br />SNAKES & ARROWS doesn't break any new musical boundaries, though the aging rockers do pull off some impressive performances on several of the tracks. Not the best Rush album, but a good collection nonetheless.
B000002J2D|3.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Another point of turn in musical direction is now more strongly present in Genesis' remaining lineup than in any other period of time, with the departure of guitarist Steve Hackett, the remaining Genesis went into a more stretch performance, now the remaining Genesis was reduced to Phil Collins in the drums and vocals, Mike Rutherford in the bass and now all the guitars, and Tony Banks in the keyboards, precisely as the title expresses it, and then there were three. The album represented now a much more fearful challenge than they presented with the departure of former leader Peter Gabriel, as they put a lot of effort into the followings A Trick Of The Tail and Wind And Wuthering, as they tried to demonstrate their actual musical genius, resulting in these bright two masterpieces, but here the situation is even more challenging, as the second musical genius that Genesis ever had was precisely Steve Hackett, but even though this is already a point of discussion among their musical performance, in ...And Then They Were Three... they didn't tried to demonstrate anything of a new hope or a remaining trace of musical genius or intelectual, original material, instead they put their best interests into paper, as ...And Then They Were Three... fails miserably in comparison to those Collins' era past two albums. Not a complete failure, still the album doesn't represent their complete transition to bastardized pop, still the album keeps a more versatile side of progressive rock, mainly recognized in songs like the explosive, fast paced opening track Down And Out, its a song that gives the best hopes for the first listen to the album, possessing such a heavy performance that they had to take out the song from live performances, and also the upcoming Undertow, being a beautiful, emotional and poetic song it stays as the best song in the album, being a composition by Tony Banks, as he dominates the best compositions in the album. Still, the albums failures are remarkable in some of its heavily synthesized compositions, which is really dissapointing, as well as some of its other compositions sound a lot duller. This is the first Collins' era album which I point as their first point of decline, as their commercial interests went a lot higher, just precisely what they shouldn't have done in such a point of transition. The album's moods are actually defined in each of its songs as a unique one, so the album doesn't possess a recognizeable cohersion, the only mood present alike as a whole album may be nostalgic, as in its cover is also expressed, and among its \\"independent\\" moods are noticeable aggressive, thoughtful, emotional, mellow, catchy, story telling and romantic. But as I mentioned these moods are completely expressed as a unit in its very few songs, just like the story telling atmosphere seen in Ballad Of Big, Scenes From A Night's Dream and The Lady Lies, while Ballad Of Big stays as an acceptable song, its vague story and heavily synthesized structure really takes off its talent, Scenses From A Night's Dream is more fast paced and slightly more memorable, it keeps a trace of talent with Banks' composition but its ruined by Phil Collins foolish touches, making the song a dissapointment in the aspects of progressive rock, but the only song that seems to be saved is The Lady Lies, which is a very comfortable and intricate song, of course, Banks' composition, and the story it tells is an enjoyable and moody one. Within Snowbound it stays as the worst song in the album, as it is a Mike Rutherford composition I didn't expect anything great, but its vague mellow efforts and repetitive chorus make it a really waste of time, and the next Burning Rope is a great song, of course as composed by Tony Banks, but its structure is not as great as its chorus, while the best lines are the final two in the chorus. Deep In The Motherlode accomplished certain fame but its just a dull, heavily synthesized song, as composed by Rutherford. But among Rutherford compositions, the only song that stand with a great position and one of their best is Say Its Alright Joe, while it starts as a soft, undertaking song, it gets a fierceful, potential chorus, a real prog song. As Tony Banks compositions were the best ones in the album, his worst is Many Too Many, while it starts with a very emotional and hopeful piano prelude and a mesmerizing drama, its incoherent and vague chorus ruins all the song. And at last but not least, the famous Follow You Follow Me Stands as one of my early favourites, sometimes it bothers me because it reflects their later pop inclinnation, but its uncompromising romantic mood is really valuable. Not their best album, still their first album with a strong decline, but it possesses still some nice and uncompromising compositions, in wich the best ones are Down And Out, Undertow, Say Its Alright Joe, The Lady Lies and Follow You Follow Me. Some highlights in the band's performance are that Mike Rutherford work in the guitars is impossible to compare with Hackett, but still good, plus Phil Collins drumming ability declines in great proportion on this album. But it isn't bad, their later showdown in neo progressive rock with Duke is where they really turn it on again, and for the last time.<br /><br />P.S.: don't get too angry with this album, keep your anger for Abacab!d.

B00005K3OT|4.0|Juliette Binoche (The English Patient) glows as Vianne Rocher, a free-spirited young woman that the wind blows into a small, morally obsessed and oppressed French town one day. Using an ancient Mayan recipe discovered by her father, she and her daughter have come there to open a chocolaterie. Her confections are out of this world, and she uses them to try to help mend the various broken people and relationships in the town. But the mayor (Alfred Molina - Spiderman 2), whose family has dominated the town for centuries and who fears she will lead the townspeople away from their traditional faith and mores, declares war on Mademoiselle Rocher and tries to turn the townspeople against her.<br /><br />One by one she gains allies, first in the form of her landlady, Armande Voizin (Judi Dench - Shakespeare In Love, Pride And Prejudice) and her grandson Luc Clairmont (Aurelien Parent Koenig - debut), which infuriates Luc's mother, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss - The Matrix), who has forbidden him from seeing his grandmother. Then she gains a battered woman (Josephine Muscat - The Ninth Gate), whose husband (Peter Stormare - Fargo) the mayor tries to reform in order to prove that his way of changing people is better. It doesn't work. Johnny Depp doesn't appear until the second act to reinforce Vianne in her cause and to offer romantic interest. He and his river gypsy friends are also considered undesirables by the town.<br /><br />What's interesting about this film is that the Christian townspeople are being held hostage by the self-righteous, morally oppressive mayor, and consequently Vianne acts more like a Christian than any of they, even though she is not a believer. She takes a genuine interest in people and tries to help them with her friendship and chocolates. The mood of the film is magical, though magic has nothing to do with it - it's really about love. The question is, will love win out before Vianne gives up and decides her cause is hopeless?<br /><br />This film is rated PG-13, which is a shame because, if several scenes that are not critical to the story had been toned down or left out, it would have made a wonderful family film. It has a story-book setting and feel that would appeal to any age. Unfortunately, several scenes push it into the category of adult romance. Nevertheless, it is a wonderful story about love in the face of prejudice that all of us need to hear, as well as enough chocolate shown onscreen to satisfy any chocolate lover's craving.<br /><br />Waitsel Smitha shame because, if several scenes that are not critical to the story had been toned down or left out, it would have made a wonderful family film.

1594489505|5.0|This book depicts all too real to my experiences of preparing asylum cases for people from Afghanistan.  The role and treatment of women in many parts of the world is appalling, especially in the Islamic world.  Khaled Hosseini is a good story writer and keeps us in suspense.  It is hard to put down book.
B000002KCV|4.0|Okay, so I still don't like the syrupy title track, popular as it is, but I still get a lot out of this album. Not as much as I do Neil's classic albums, though - there is a lot of cheese, other than that title track (\\"Field of Opportunity\\"; \\"Human Highway\\"; \\"Already One\\"). Still, it's a lot of fun, and it's a lot more consistent than the last one: nothing rises to the level of \\"Like a Hurricane\\", but there are more good songs here: the country-rocker \\"Motorcycle Mama\\" is one of Neil's best ever; I also really like the gentle folk \\"Look Out for My Love\\"; the soothing, romantic \\"Lotta Love\\" (okay, maybe \\"romantic\\" isn't quite the sentiment Neil's got in mind... but I still like the song a lot); the nostalgic \\"Goin' Back\\"; and the emotional cover of \\"Four Strong Winds\\". So, right, it's a pretty good album. But I'd hesitate to put it in the ranks of Neil's country-folk holy trinity: Harvest, Harvest Moon and Prairie Wind. It's a heck of a lot better than Silver and Gold (bad) and Old Ways (uneven). There are better Young discs (the aforementioned; After the Gold Rush; Rust Never Sleeps; Tonight's the Night; On the Beach; Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere; Freedom; Ragged Glory; the extremely underrated Broken Arrow, and that's just scratching the surface), but I like Comes a Time just fine.
B0001US8EO|5.0|My wife and I enjoy Westerns. We believe this movie to be one of the all-time best. Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid and Bill Pullman all do some fine turns at acting in this here movin' picture show.    We purchased the two disc special edition set as some \\"onery varmint\\" went and stole our VHS tapes. Probably did us a favor, I reckon.
0060899190|4.0|Big time fan fot he website and love this collection of books. The honesty makes me laugh, cry and feel totally connected to others. A birlliant project.
075640407X|5.0|... I was initially a little worried that it was written in the first person. The worry was that the description of the events would not unfold properly; or be detailed enough; or that the character development would suffer from the account; etc.    But that was quickly dismissed the first chapter. Rothfus captures all the above and more in this book. He is not the first author to write in first person, but he certainly does it well.    Add to that the potential for a nice magic system and a nice background plot and I am looking forward to the second book.    I would trade a little of the Romance with Denna for some additional action (but that is just the \\"caveman\\" in me!).    If you are tired of many of the hackneyed authors out there (Robert Jordan, etc.), then you will find this a very refreshing read.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I took a few of my grandchildren to this movie when it was first released.  We all laughed and cried together and were amazed at the very good special effects.  It also proved to be a GOOD moral story for teens of all ages out there right now.  The young people do NOT have very much to choose from in the way of good movies, but I think this ONE deserves a special place in everyone's home for FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT!  Enjoy..Jo
B00003CX8V|1.0|Like many of the golden age \\"classics,\\" this movie simply does not hold up over time and betrays all the moral and societal restrictions of the time in which it was made. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine might as well be Rob and Laura Petrie in their separate beds -- tiptoeing around attraction and physical desires to the point of absurdity.    Other actors in the film give performances that are so stereotypical and \\"clever\\" that they belong more in a sitcom than a motion picture. True, Jack Lemmon is a great actor, but even he can't save this extremely dialog-heavy and ultimately boring movie.     The famous last scene where Jack and Shirley end up playing cards -- GIVE ME A BREAK! That's not what two people in love who ultimately find each other would end up doing. But of course, in a 1960 movie, that's what they had to settle for.     The movie works as an interesting period piece, but is hopelessly dated and an example of when movies were limited by moral and societal shackles that make them look -- today -- ridiculous.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I just love this movie, so happy that i could purchase this and own it
B000050FEN|3.0|Upon a first viewing (years ago) \\"Se7en\\" impressed for the simple reason that it didn't have a happy ending.   It was the only logical ending there could be, after such a brutal two-hour wallow in the sludgy undergrowth of human nature.         However, with age, and maybe even some spiritual growth, I've come to realize that the ending is actually not tragic, that it, in fact, shows God's plan for mankind working on this deep, tectonic plate level.  And further, that it is an even better movie for that reason.       In \\"Seven,\\" everyone is a sinner - even Kevin Spacey's character (whose sin is envy).   Everyone that is, save Morgan Freeman's character - we'll come back to him a little later.  The wife of Brad Pitt's young, macho detective (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) is this sort of Eve-like creation.   All innocence on the outside, but working a pretty serious deception on her husband - she's not telling Pitt's character that she's pregnant.  Her reasoning (Milton's take on \\"Eve\\") is a bit soft-headed; something about \\"how horrible the world is\\"; you get the feeling she's about back out of it all, and abort the kid, possibly.   Or at least, that she's reserved that option.      If Paltrow is Eve, Pitt is Adam - a lumpen proletariat malcontent of an Adam, talking out of the side of his mouth, bruised-up, leading with his chin, and gullible as heck.   Again, like Milton's Adam, who is a bit of simpleton gardener type, led around by the nose by his lubricious wife.      Spacey's character is the Devil; constantly cross-examining and impeaching Adam/Pitt, baiting him, even.   He gets the better of Pitt's character in their one physical encounter, which is ridiculous when you consider the relative bulk of the two men (Spacey vs. Pitt) but perfectly logical when you're attuned to their symbolic functions.   Of course Adam's not going to get the better of Satan.      So, Spacey/Satan gets Pitt/Adam to sin in the penultimate scene of the movie, after admitting his own sin(in language that actually mirrors Milton's characterization of Satan - \\"I envy your normal life\\"; in \\"Paradise Lost\\", the devil's reaction to his first sight of Adam and Eve goes something like \\"[Adam] pressed her matron lip/With kisses pure: aside the Devil turned/For envy, yet with jealous leer malign/Eyed them askance. . .\\"   (Book IV 501-504).      The end of the movie is not an unhappy one, then, because it recapitulates the \\"felix culpa\\" (the \\"happy fall\\") of Eden.  That is, Pitt/Adam's sin of anger is a sin, but it is at least a fruitful one, because now, God will redeem the world.  How is this played in \\"Seven\\"?   In the very next scene, Morgan Freeman hovers over the lost Adam, getting assurances from the D.A. that \\"we'll do everything we can for him.\\"      And then, Freeman's last, telling, line of dialogue:                  The D.A.:  \\"Where will you be?\\"                 Freeman:  \\"Around.   I'll be around.\\"        Nice word that \\"around\\", resonant as it with suggestions of circularity, return.  Obviously Freeman's character will be around.  He is God; he's always there, watching over our (Adam's) shoulder.   God \\"will be around\\" -- Christ will come \\"around\\" and fish our chestnuts out.       Think of that climactic scene, the stand-off between Spacey and Pitt.  What does Freeman do?   He does exactly what God does.  He consoles, he reassures, he provides, but he does not force Pitt's hand - he says, \\"Give me the gun.   He wants you to do this.  If you kill him, he wins.\\"  He even makes the decision that Pitt should see the contents of the box - because otherwise Pitt wouldn't be exercising free will, would he?   He wouldn't know all the facts - simili modo, God tells Adam and Eve exactly what the rules are (\\"don't eat of that tree\\").      The scene is perhaps most perfect demonstration of the Augustinian paradox on film ever - of course you have free will, and of course God can force your hand towards the good.   But he won't.  And he'll be there afterwards for you, even if you do sin.  Always.   \\"He'll be around. \\"

1594489505|5.0|I love this book, but it is so hard to provide an adequate description of it.  Bleak and depressing, yet unbelievably powerful.  The characters are incredibly drawn and the writing is amazingly beautiful. Almost every adjective you can think of could be used to describe this book--harsh, tender, heart-wrenching, uplifting. If you read it, you'll understand.    I love this book!!! I want everyone I know to read it.

B0009X7664|5.0|2008 marks 45 years when this movie came to theatres everywhere. 45 years later the movie still stands the test of time for its acting, its story and proving once and for all there are lots of great movies and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of them! Gregory Peck delivered a first class role as Atticus Finch. The DVD also has some wonderful extras including Mary Badham with her relationship with Gregory Peck during the filming. This movie is definitely a classic for everyone to watch!!
B00005JPLW|5.0|I'm sure I could come up with 300 great reasons to own this classic. This movie was one I was skeptical about when I saw the previews. I thought it could be a huge hit or be unwatchable. It was the former. A great adaptation of a comic story based on one of the world's most historic events. You will not be disappointed or be able to take your eyes off the screen. It has hypnotic sights and sounds including a fantastic score. Buy this movie and add it to your DVD library right now. In a year where I couldn't wait for Spidey 3, Transformers, and Pirates 3, it was 300 that soared to the top of my list as best movie of the year. An instant classic.
B000OCZBS0|5.0|We have a unique piece in our hands.  I'm pretty sure that for an average metal listener, operatic female vocals and male/female dual vocal combination is nothing new (Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, anyone?).  For the experimentor, splicing together different and irrelevant genres is nothing new also.<br /><br />Diablo Swing Orchestra, on the other hand, is new all around.<br /><br />The Butcher's Ballroom consists of thirteen tracks and each track, while following pretty much the same pattern, manages to amaze and stupefy.  The musical influences of D:S:O include but are not limited to dark cabaret, at times disco (Balrog Boogie and Gunpowder Chant), flamenco, opera, classical (or neo-classical, more appropriately), rock (hard rock) and metal (heavy metal) and jazz.  The vocals, whether screaming or moaning, are a perfect fit to it, never once losing their charm; for each of the songs, this part cherishes that part.  The music is unique and often times challenging with harmonies layered atop each other - and not to mention ''Pink Noise Waltz'' where they managed to squeeze 4-4 beat riffs and melodies into a classical 3-beat waltz rhythm.  The guitar work is at times pretty well-known, using classical hard-rock/heavy-metal structure (save for the Spanish guitar partitions where they use mariachi styles); however, the guitars, while an integral part, only serve to emphasize the other instruments - that of cello, some wind instruments (trumpet, for instance), and the glorious keyboards using the term versitality to its fullest.<br /><br />Lyrically, while along the same line with avant garde metal's abstract and often nonsensically painful (and often dark) lyrics D:S:O shares a tender side - the writing is skillful enough to at times make you feel the silky tenderness sliding across the songs.<br /><br />Now; who will this album satisfy? Pretty much everybody - those who like experimentation, those who like unique stuff, those who want to hear something wicked, rock, metal and general music fans alike.

Check out Jess Nevin's guide, for one, and Fantastic Victoriana site if you want to delve further into who is who.    Mina Harker has to retrieve a drug addicted Alan Quatermain, to put together a mission for the British Secret Service. This involves recruiting Nemo, Hyde and the Invisible Man, and locking horns with the Professor and the Devil Doctor.    As an added bonus, there is the prose 'Allan and the Sundered Veil', in which a not as dead as thought Quatermain goes in search of substances to imbibe, and in this state encounters both Randolph and John Carter, the Time Traveller, and a Great Old One. Perhaps, anyway. Even more ahead for him after that.
1564029654|5.0|Very cute book. Three baby owls syblings awaken at night to find their mother not in the nest. Although they know she is out hunting, they are nervous and find it hard to wait for her. She does return and remind them that she will always take care of them. The color scheme is dark (because it is night) but the drawings of the owls are charming. The sentences are short and the repeat in patterns, making it easy for children to follow. The distinct personalities of the baby owls make for laughs and smiles and are a memorable quality of the book.
B00007GZQZ|2.0|This is not a good comedy, it is a bad one. Let's remember that this bombed when it came out.  There is no story in this movie except a house falling apart, and that is the only gag as well, a lot of ridiculous scenes of parts of the house spontaneously falling apart.  As implausible as this is, it's occasionally mildly funny, unlike any of the dialogue, which is just implausible and not funny.  Tom Hanks is in his forced acting stage, and very plastic.  And Shelly Long, uff, let's not even go there.
B000R4SMD6|4.0|This movie was pretty good, except as a mystery it gives too many clues from the onset. The whole time I felt like talking to the screen. Although the acting was  much better than average and the cinematic directing very engrossing, the story was too weak to match, and failed to engage any empathy with any of the characters.<br /><br />Overall a pretty good but far from great movie.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|A taut and well constructed thriller with great scenes of one-ups-manship between gosling and hopkins. The competing sub-plots of one man's rise vs. another's fall maintains the dramatic tension.  The romantic aside also hits the right points as it doesn't attempt to dominate the main tension of legal and office political manuevers. Good supporting performances, well edited and driven, and one of the year's most solid films.
B000O179EK|5.0|When I got my HD-DVD player last year one of the titles I couldn't wait for was Big Lebowski.  I hadn't seen it in several years and when I finally put it in the player, I was so glad I had waited.  Not only is the picture and the sound excellent, but this is one of the greatest movies of all time.<br /><br />The writing is so good.  The acting is fantastic (Jeff and John's best acting performances by far).  The comedy is still funny after 11 viewings.  I still giggle to myself anytime I think about the scene where Walter jumps out of the car \\"To take the hill\\" and the machine gun is going off, while the Dude crashes into a telephone pole.  Hilarious hilarious all the way through.<br /><br />Just remember not to spread human ashes on the beach when the wind is blowing.  LOL LOL LOL
B000P0I4O4|2.0|Bad script. Incredibly disappointing as one is desperately craving intelligent and strategic thinking in a movie such as this, but it stumbles right out of the gate.  I mean, Freeman would never have even gone off with Cusack in the first place, he would have just sat on his butt awaiting his associates.  Also, all the rambo scenes with the gym teacher were way over the top.  And let's not even talk about the ending where the coach and the two hit men all meet in the woods at the same instant, please.  There's tons of other non-sequiters in this movie too.  Freeman and Cusack must have really been bored to dive into this stinker.
0440238609|1.0|Having enjoyed The Golden Compass to the point of calling it the single greatest adventure story I've ever read, I was severely disappointed by The Subtle Knife.  While I am from the generation that was supposedly desensitized to violence, I found the depictions of violence and sexual innuendo to be in poor taste and unnecessary to the plot, which was almost nonexistent.  This book is completely inappropriate for children (and some squeamish adults) and parents should be aware of the content before handing it to anyone under 17.  The richness and wonder of the first novel in the His Dark Materials trilogy was not present here, and even favorite characters became annoying and  one-dimensional.  The entire book was just poorly written.  I found myself reading the plot summary on Wikipedia just so I could avoid wasting any more time reading The Subtle Knife and move on to The Amber Spyglass.  At this point, I do not trust Mr. Pullman with his own characters and am hopeful that Book 3 redeems him.

B000BF0D9M|4.0|If you want music that will get you moving, yet be unabtrusive when necessary, this artist and his blend of flamenco meeting new age is for you.  I've been listening to Cook for a few years now, having discovered him after my search for more music to expand my interest in acoustic guitar.    Following Leibert, Cook is one of my favorites.  He truly knows his way around a guitar. And while I can't say I equally love every cut on this compilation, overall, I enjoy this set very much.     I know, I know, if you're a flamenco purist or snob, artists like him make you crazy and you'd never think to add him to your collection!  But, for the rest of us who simply want something that makes us think, work by, relax by, entertain by, and makes you happy...well I don't think Cook can be beat.  I'm hoping this really isn't The Ultimate Jesse Cook, because that would mean there's not much more to follow and I'm hoping for great new sounds from Cook for many listening years to come.
B00012QM8G|5.0|SCHINDLER'S LIST is simply a marvelous example from the exceptional body of work from filmmaker Stephen Speilberg.  Set during the height of Nazi occupation in Europe, this take a sobering look at the work of Oskar Schindler [Liam Neeson] and his astonishing transfomation from self-centered lothario to humanitarian.  Based on a true story, the work of Oskar Schindler, a gentile who worked as an advocate for Jews by offering them work in his crockery factory, as well as offering them refuge, all the while under the nose of a bloodthirsty Nazi [Ralph Fiennes], is portrayed vividly in this 1993 production.<br /><br />Initially, Speilberg didn't intend for this film to be anywhere close to the success that it became.  SCHINDLER'S LIST went on to win numerous well-earned Academy Awards, critical acclaim, as well as recognition for Stephen Speilberg, as a director and a visionary artist.  The acting is beautiful, the black-and-white shots make a bold and chilling impression on the viewer, as well as the minimal use of color (with the exception of the infamous \\"little girl in the red coat\\"--you'll have to view the film to fully understand the significance and symbolism of this recurring character).  This is a very important story that recounts a very painful chapter from our past, as human beings, at a time where seemingly \\"civilized\\" individuals senselessly brutalized and murdered tens of thousands of Jews, Gypsies, and other scapegoats in the name of the Third Reich and fascist violence.  Don't miss this one.  It truly is a remarkable example of exemplary cinematic storytelling.
0618680004|2.0|Top 5 ways Richard Dawkins is like Rush Limbaugh<br /><br />5.  Both are very intelligent, and happy to tell you how smart they are (again, and again, and again).<br />4.  If you don't agree with them, both believe you are ignorant or an idiot.<br />3.  Both extrapolate the views of all who disagree from the extremes.  No possibility of honest, thoughtful, dissent exists in their minds.<br />2.  Both have a handful of good points which expose flaws in the thinking of many opponents.  Both apply their handful of good points to every solution.<br />1.  Both have persuasion and not \\"scientific enlightenment\\" as their stated goal.<br /><br />In the end, I found the work disappointing.  I had expected a cerbral beating-down of religious ideas.  There were a few good points, but mostly only repetitive badgering and name-calling towards those who didn't find his ideas obvious.  No scientific backing was given to the few statistics used (like one in a billion for the chance of life on a planet).<br /><br />Like most propagandists, Dr. Dawkins has the stated intent (mentioned at the outset) to persuade and not educate.  This was disappointing.
0446614459|4.0|Baldacci's presentation of that \\"Lord Jim\\" moment, the moment that determines the course of your life, is told quite well.  Two of these moments, actually.  It's an interesting story about two Secret Service agents, one male and one female, who both make split second mistakes, and their attempt to redeem themselves by finding out who kidnapped a presidential candidate.  Again, however, I wish the author had condescended to include explicit lovemaking scenes between the two agents.  What does it take to get an R-rated book these days anyway?
B00030DEQE|5.0|My old eMachines T1150 has no built-in NIC.  Two cheap 10/100 NICs were not recognized by Solaris 10 x86 (actually, Solaris Nevada b69).  I finally decide to buy the Intel PWLA8391GT PRO/1000 GT PCI NIC since I read it used the Solaris e1000g driver.  Sure enough, it worked for me.  My PC has a 1.3GHz Celeron, 384MB RAM, and two 40GB 5400 RPM disks, so the throughput on the NIC is probably limited by the hardware around it.  Thought I'd pass this info along in case there are Solaris folks out there looking for compatible PCI NICs.  I believe there's a PCIe version available too.
0679809015|4.0|This books associates animals with sounds and is great for a child who dose not yet read. There are no words, you make the sound of the animal and your child is suppose to identify the correct animal. There is a flap that hides a picture of the correct animal that you can open to display the correct answer. Fun little book but quite redundant and not challenging enough for a kid that already reads.
038572179X|5.0|I read a lot, but very few books stick with me after I finish them. Atonement is different. Ian McEwan's novel is everything literary critics say it is. Sweeping, stunning, epic, moving, visionary, deep, thought provoking...the list could go on.     What struck me the most was McEwan's ability to translate onto paper the innerworkings of his characters' psyches. Briony, Robbie and Cecilia's every action and word is backed up with a beautifully detailed thought process. I loved the multi-narrational approach to the story. The honesty and humanity in the characters. McEwan doesn't try to create perfection, but in the careful way he describes his central characters, I feel he achieves it.     I will never be able to forget the huge ramifications of a single day, a single word and an overactive child's immagination. Because it happens so rarely, it's hard to grasp the concept that such singular events can completely alter the course of three people's lives so completely. Briony's lie doesn't change the course of Britain's history, but for herself, Cecilia and Robbie the effects are more devastating and eternal.     I will definitely be reading more of McEwan's work. This was my first foray into the worlds he creates. I can't wait to see what else is waiting for me.
B000UX6THK|2.0|Not only did I have to wait YEARS for S2 to finally come out, but I had tracked down the pilot overseas (it was legally released there, but not here.  NOOO idea why)  Luckily, the pilot was region free so I was able to watch it.      I have been screwed with so many times now because I am a loyal fan of several shows and have jumped at the chance to buy the dvd's.  The real fans are the only ones hurt by their release tactics.  The casual fans benefit.
B000068IEU|3.0|When I bought this film at my local fye, being a Wes Craven fan, I was instantly interested. But when I read the case, I was kinda leery. I didn't pay that close attention to it... until the end. I have no compassion for rapists, pedophiles and killers, so the conclusion was perfect revenge fantasy for me. In the beginning, I may have judged it too harshly. I also liked I Spit on your Grave, oddly enough, though it too was very disturbing, but by today's standards, both are rather tame-Eye for an Eye with Sally Field was alot more graphic than this, to me. I like various genres-good vs.evil, cartoon, revenge, but I generally won't watch anything that glorifies rape and torture-but these films cover the coping of these savage, sometimes unforgivable actions and the consequences of them, so to speak. I'm not an advocate for taking justice into your own hands, but what about when justice fails, what do you do then? I don't love this film, but I don't hate it either, hence the rating.
B00005JPQR|4.0|I place this film series at the top of the action genre.  They have a strong backstory, the plot moves well and the acting and direction tend to be spot-on.  The thing that has kept these films at edge is their believability 1) that this sleight of hand has happened to this man, and 2) that it's been so seamlessly orchestrated it logically could happen to any of us.  That balance of acceptable elevated dramatics and Everyman appeal  has kept the story and its delivery grounded through this series.  That said, this installment of the series made a few leaps that obliterated my suspension of belief regarding logistical maneuvers and amazing feats of impossibility.  Flawlessly entering areas of top of the line security, racing through tightly crowded mazes of Moroccan markets and sprawling rooftops with all principles neatly in sight and converging at the same point, and the highest of intelligence available to be duped and reduped pushed the limits of what I felt this film could ask of me.  Chase scenes dragged on a bit, as did skillfully crafted fight scenes.  While those bits did not seal the deal for me, the subtler and more widely accepted currents of tracking anyone anywhere to the nth degree of his/her existence remained consistently upsetting.  Damon's portrayal of his character remains tight as ever, though this segment in particular did not allow for much development, emotional or otherwise, of Bourne/Webb. Information came out around his true identity, though not as much as we (and he) were set up to expect.  I would welcome another sequel, though this one would still be a high note to end on, as well.

0743496728|5.0|Nineteen Minutes deals with a town, a school shooting, and a boy named Peter Houghton, bullied since the day he started Kindergarten. In Picoult's signature style, we hear the thoughts of multiple characters throughout the story.<br /><br />The beginning chapters are about as suspenseful as you can get. We meet Josie, a girl who looks perfect on the outside but is drowning on the inside. She's getting ready for school at Sterling High. She's dating Matt Royston, one of the most popular boys in school, but plans how she will commit suicide when she is discovered to be the fake she knows she is.<br /><br />We meet Alex Cormier, her mother, a Supreme Court judge who is more comfortable on the bench than in the mother role.<br /><br />We meet Lacey Houghton, a midwife. She treasure her comfortable home and role as a wife and mother.<br /><br />And we meet Peter. When we first meet him, he wakes up and goes to his computer to read email messages, only to see something on his screen he never wanted to see again. We don't know what it is or why it upsets him.<br /><br />We get a few scenes of a regular school day. Next thing you know, Sterling High School is in a panic because shots were fired. The detective on duty, Patrick Dushan, runs into the building processing a huge crime scene while he is trying to apprehend the shooter. We see the sights of blood, cowering students, and interrupted class activities. We hear the gunshots. We are in the middle of the action when Patrick finally tracks down the shooter in the gym locker room.<br /><br />The shooter is Peter Houghton, a slight boy with delicate features. What would cause Peter to do such a thing? The only thing he says is, \\"They started it.\\"<br /><br />The rest of the tale is spun by scenes from the present and the past, from multiple characters, but mostly the four mentioned above. We hear how Lacey and Alex met, and Lacey delivered Josie. We learn Peter's story and what forces influenced him to act the way he did. We see Peter pushed, tripped, punched, de-pantsed, and humiliated. What keeps us reading is that Picoult wisely hides two pieces of information until the end. We don't know what happened in the locker room when Peter shot Matt and Josie walked away with only a scratch. And we don't know what Peter saw on his computer that day.<br /><br />Picoult is a master writer. Who else could create a story where the most sympathetic character is a teenage boy who walked into a school building and gunned down ten people? Peter was bullied from day one, and we want his tormentors to face the music. We want them to take responsibility for their actions. Of course, not all the victims were bullies, but every painful step of Peter's walk is torture to us. Teachers seem oblivious to his suffering. Even his parents aren't always an ally.<br /><br />The character hardest to empathize with is Josie Cormier, who used to be Peter's best and only friend in grade school. Now, in the present she has committed the worst type of treason, sleeping with the enemy. She runs in the popular crowd, which contained Matt Royston and Drew, Peter's enemy number one and two. She dates Matt and doesn't stand up for Peter. She is so afraid of being kicked out of the group herself, that she forgets what real friendship is like. She knows her position is unstable and is based on putting others down. When she asks Matt why he has to treat Peter that way, he tells her, \\"If there isn't a 'them,' then there can't be an 'us'.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed this work as much as My Sister's Keeper. In this one book, there is court drama, love stories, friendship, betrayal, and the story a town that can't seem to get past that day. I wanted a little more sympathy for Peter from the town. They were all so ready to crucify him, and even when his torture is revealed in court, little sympathy is gained. This book contains scenes of sexuality and some language. It is appropriateand humiliated. What keeps us reading is that Picoult wisely hides two pieces of information until the end.

B000R7I3LY|5.0|This is currently my favorite cd.  I discovered this amazing artist through iTunes, and once I fell in love with her Single, \\"Love Song\\"  I knew that I had to pre-order my copy of Little Voice.  I'm so glad I bought it.  I would classify her as kind of jazzy pop.  It's a lot of amazing vocals, piano, and pretty bass lines.  I was just a little disappointed that the majority of the cd is slower songs, but they're still really nice arrangements.  I would say she covers a few genres however.  My favorite of her songs, \\"Love Song\\" is ilke pop, whereas her upbeat song, \\"Many the Miles\\" is very gospal- like.  This is a good buy.  If you like her sound, then you won't be disappointed!
0374105235|5.0|When I first began reading this book, the horrors that the children faced were almost too much to bear, and I almost put it away. I left it for a few days, and when I came back to it, I couldn't put it down -- cliche, I know, but true.    Beah writing style is so easy to read, and yet, his descriptions of nature -- especially when he is forced to live completely alone in a jungle for a significant amount of time -- are so brilliant and captivating that sometimes, you almost feel the oppressive heat or the pelting rain.    The journey he takes, both physical and emotional, seems impossible. How a child can go from a loving, hip hop crazy youngster to an unconscious, drug-addicted killing machine, then back to a loving youngster who picks up where he left before being recruited is amazing, to say the very least. Even at his worst, I found myself rooting for him, and hoping the book would eventually tell of some kernel of goodness to come out of all the horrors in Sierra Leone.    This book is too important to skip.

B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has made a career of writing and directing fantastic films, and with the first volume of the Kill Bill duet the tradition continues. On the surface, Kill Bill: Volume 1 spins like an above average revenge flick - an ex-assassin known only as \\"The Bride\\" is brutally tortured on her wedding day by her former employer's lethal band of contract killers: the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The `blood-splattered bride' is left for dead on the church floor, but her wounds eventually heal and four years later she begins her personal quest for revenge. Plot points such as these, however, are not what make Kill Bill (or any Tarantino film for that matter) special.<br /><br />From the first grizzly minute all the way to the credits, every shot, every character, every line of dialogue, and every aspect of the story is driven by Tarantino's love for Hong Kong martial arts films, samurai movies, spaghetti westerns, and revenge flicks. These influences can be seen everywhere - from the camera framing copied from The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, to the final battle at the House of Blue Leaves where The Bride wears a yellow catsuit very much like the one worn by Bruce Lee in Game of Death. Tarantino uses references such as these to give Kill Bill: Volume 1 a cinematic depth that most revenge films can't match.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino dropped out of school at the tender age of 16 to pursue acting. However, he developed his love of film while working at a video rental shop in California. Since then, Tarantino has directed a total of five films, written eight, and won an Oscar (for Pulp Fiction). His love of film bleeds through every frame of every movie he is directly linked to - as evident by his use of homage as a film style. Pulp Fiction paid tribute to (among other things) gangster movies. In Reservoir Dogs, it was heist films and undercover cop stories. And in Kill Bill it was revenge, samurai showdowns, and old Westerns.<br /><br />One of the strongest aspects of Kill Bill is that Tarantino embraced the simple mentality of typical revenge flicks while, at the same time, generously applying his own spirit. By default, movies that deal with reprisals tend to be a little bit shallow and predictable - someone has to kill or harm someone else for some wrongdoing.<br /><br />What sets Kill Bill apart is the dialogue. For the film's entire 111 minute running time, the story is unfurled using dialogue that is packed with black comedy, old Asian legends, pop culture references, and extraordinary bravado. For example, when The Bride awakens in a hospital bed four years after the massacre, she learns that when she was comatose the head hospital attendant was acting as her pimp - selling her for $50 a \\"session.\\" While this might have otherwise come across as a totally revolting and extremely dire situation, the dialogue and characters involved turn the scene into black comedy gold by playing off of the hick stereotype associated with many small Texas towns.<br /><br />Another example of where the dialogue shines is when The Bride travels to the tiny island of Okinawa, Japan to meet with the legendary sword smith Hattori Hanzo.  The nature of the film changes dramatically (for the better) as Hanzo passes on ancient Samurai proverbs to aid The Bride in her fight. This scene sets up a more purposeful tone for the remainder of the film and might contain the most powerful lines in the entire movie. Before giving the `yellow-haired warrior' (The Bride) his powerful `Hanzo Steel' samurai blade, Hattori effectively sums up the entire idea of vengeance by saying that revenge is \\"never a straight line. It's a forest, and like a forest it's easy to lose your way.\\" This is the type of dialogue that sets Kill Bill apart. The ideas behind it are not new, but they are executed in such a way that they come off as fresh, funky, and unique.<br /><br />The only downfall of Kill Bill: Volume 1 is the way it was released. Originally, Tarantino wrote and directed the project as one film. However, due to its four-hour plus running time, the Miramax production company decided to split it into two `volumes.' Due to this separation, the first volume comes across as light on story and heavy on violence while the second part seems light on action and heavy on plot exploration. The difference is especially noticeable in Kill Bill: Volume 2, which contains only two major fight sequences. The lack of closure at the end of Volume 1, due to Miramax's attempt to sell multiple tickets to the same movie, must be listed as a flaw of Tarantino's (otherwise) brilliant project.<br /><br />Kill Bill is an experience. It pulls ideas from many different cultures, movies, genres, legends, and old television shows, and packages them together in one super-fine blood-soaked escapade. The only problem is that it's not one escapade (as it was originally meant to be) - it's two. Splitting the film causes a jarring shift in tone that's difficult to ignore. The best solution is to watch both DVDs back-to-back, thus eliminating what might be the only problem with one of the best films of the past decade.wever, due to its four-hour plus running time, the Miramax production company decided to split it into two `volumes.'

0783225482|5.0|I love this movie. It's dark, funny and the the cast is perfect. The storyline is a little out there, but that and the cast is what makes this movie a big hit in my eyes. I'm a huge Meryl Steep fan! I would also reccommend \\"SheDevil\\" with Meryl Streep & Roseanne Barr. Another out there storyline, but it's one of \\"sweet revenge\\" movies. Thankfully I was able to purchase this movie from Amazon at an awesome price!!
B00005JMK0|5.0|I can't believe that I can't just log on and order a dvd of this film!  I vividly remember watching it years ago when I heard the music on an old tape today.  What a disappointment.  Please Amazon get it onto dvd!!
B000BT97AO|1.0|If a movie hasn't captured my interest within 15 minutes, it's toast.  After 15 minutes of viewing this turkey I had only a fuzzy notion of what the story was about, none of the characters were engaging in the slightest, but I had been bombarded with heavily overdone visual effects.  I shut it down.  Save yourself 15 minutes of disappointment and just pass it up.

B000I0RR76|5.0|I have seen this movie many times in various formats...including 16mm and 35mm film.  I will skip the review...we all know this is one of the greatest swashbuckler/action/adventure/love stories ever made.  Check out any movie review book if need be.  I prefer to focus on the fact that I have never seen it look this good.  Minute details jump out at you so effortlessly that you'll think you are there.  The Technicolor photography is breathtaking.  This is a must have in every collection.  Casablanca too.  Hats off to Warner Brothers for giving the HD early adopters the best they have.  I can't wait for Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind.
B000000OU0|4.0|This is a fun CD for those of us who remember The Eagles in their earlier years. The track that pushed me over the edge towards buying the CD was 'Hotel California' the intro is much smoother and far more polished than the cover done during the Eagles frantic heydays. I also like the cover of Don Henley's songs, New York Minute, and Get Over It. I think this is the only CD that has the cut Learn to be Still, another good one. If you enjoy the ultimate craftsmanship of the groups' guitar work, this is a good buy. I enjoyed the DVD of this performance too.

This is a must have in every collection.  Bring on Gone With The Wind and Citizen Kane.

Since I was a freshmen in high school when \\"Hybrid Theory\\" came out I was ofcourse listening to this band. The over-produced, pro-tool using nu metal pop band did grab your attention if you had the mindset of a 15 year old such as I. Fast foward to nearly seven years later and this band is huge, I remember seeing these guy's play with Kottonmouth Kings and Hed PE at the nearest dump of a club this city could offer. The band seems lazy, rich and bored and not worth giving actual musical writing a chance. I'm alone on Valentine's Day? I'm sorry Chester, hopefully next time around a woman will except your chocolate and flowers. Give me a break, I hate insulting bands and what not but this album is so bland and boring, Rick Rubin's touch seems nowhere to be found.

B000SQJ27I|5.0|Manu Chao's first new studio album in six years, \\"La Radiolina\\", far exceeded my expectations.  I think this may actually be his best album to date - there is more musical diversity and less loops, and as always, his politics are spot-on.  So glad Manu Chao is back - hopefully he'll do more dates again soon in the U.S. so Americans can enjoy what everyone else in the world is already hip to!
B00004XMTJ|3.0|As an avid Andrew Lloyd Weber fan and someone who has seen Cats no fewer that 21 times at various theaters all over the world, I was disappointed in this production.  It did little to capture what it could have of the stage essence. It was too \\"movie-like\\" in how it appeared and very \\"untheater-like\\" even compared to other videos of stage productions.
B00006AW2O|4.0|12 X 5 is a very good CD.  I was a little disappointed because even though this release was compiled from the incredible Chess recording sessions in Chicago (during the Rolling Stones first US tour) there are a couple of unexpected weaker moments and I hadn't really expected any since I'd heard so many good things about the Chess sessions.<br /><br />Ok, let's deal with the weaker moments:<br /><br />- Why on earth did these guys record \\"Boardwalk\\"?  What were they and/or producer Andrew Oldham thinking?! That song was perfect. It's one of those tunes that should NEVER be covered.  Beside, The Rolling Stones cannot sing doo-wop music.  I doubt many fans would argue that this wasn't a ridiculous tune selection.  Why not cover Mannish Boy or something like that?  After all, this was recorded at Chess studios in Chicago and by all accounts, Muddy Waters and Buddy Guy were actually present!  Boardwalk?  That is/was just so wrong.<br />- The backing vocals throughout the session are... um... questionable is the kindest word that comes to mind.<br />- The original tunes by Jagger and Richards are very weak indeed.  This song writing team had not yet blossomed and it may have been a wiser move to wait until there was quality material to record.  In the liner notes, Oldham notes that The Rolling Stones are perfectionists... unless it comes to spelling (it's c-o-n-g-r-a-t-u-l-a-t-i-o-n-s morons - and no, that isn't some English spelling, my wife is English and I spent about 11 years living over there) and tuning a 12 string I guess.  Congradulations is one of those stupid teen-age angst tunes and the 12 string is grossly out of tune (that B string on a 12 string box can be a real pain in the ***).  Grown Up Wrong is only a little better.<br /><br />Now for some superior moments:<br /><br />The tunes co-written by the entire band (Nanker Phlege) are far superior to the Jagger-Richards numbers - especially the instrumental 2120 South Michigan Avenue.<br /><br />- Brian Jones' harmonica playing (no, that isn't Jagger playing harmonica in the early Stones boys and girls) is a joy to hear.<br />- with the exception of the aforementioned \\"Boardwalk\\" all of the covers are done with superb style and effect.

B00005JL0I|1.0|You can tell that five directors and a host of writers attempted this mis-mash of almost unrelated scenes, and the directorial and acting styles are vastly different in each.  In fact, it looks like several really good movies were trying to be made, but none of them is finished; instead, each one was abandoned and all were spliced together into an incoherent LSD trip, and the result is a tiresome waste of money and talent.
B000RJO578|5.0|Wright & Pegg have done it again. if you love Shaun of the Dead, you'll love this, period. Run, don't walk.
0765350386|5.0|You need to read this book! Brandon Sanderson is an author you cannot afford to miss.     This is epic fantasy with new and imaginatively distinct characters, an understandable and fascinating magic system, that climaxes where most series end.  The novel raises questions about understanding class systems, governments, prophesy, religion, man's relationship to Gods and other men, and when and if violence is necessary or appropriate to overthrow tyranny. All that with a fun heist plot and breakneck pacing, this is a great read.
0977326403|5.0|The social sector does not need to be more business like; it needs to implement more great business principles tailored for the social entities economic engine - so says Collins in this 35 page, add-on for a future \\"Good to Great\\" update.  In addition to tailoring some of the Great principles<br />* Define Great by calibrating success without business (monetary) metrics<br />* Lead thru a blend of personal humility and professional will to get things done within a diffuse power structure<br />* Get high quality people with a personal commitment to the cause on-board the bus<br />* Find the intersection of the social entity's Passion, Best at, and its Resource Engine<br />* Build brand recognition<br />to the specifics of the social entity, Collins suggests that the leadership principle of managing within a diffuse power structure is something for the business sector to learn; as business executives do not have the same concentration of pure executive power they once enjoyed.<br /><br />All in, a useful bit of thinking for those in a not-for-profit enterprise, as well as for business leaders who like to look at organizational effectiveness from different perspectives.

B00020HEL6|5.0|An exceptional talent.  Her interpretation of the music is far ahead of her years.
B000CZ0Q5W|4.0|This CD was my first introduction to Pat & the PMG & from the very first track Minuano (which has become a standard encore item at most PMG concerts) the lyricism, compositional excellence, guitar virtuosity and superb musical arrangements of the man shine through like a beacon. These features are also highlighted on (It's Just) Talk & Third Wind & in essence these three tracks showcase modern ensemble jazz at its best. One of the really great things about PMG albums is the space Pat allows his other band members, often on multi-instruments, to really shine (one thinks of Mark Ledford playing trumpet & marimbas & then singing all in the opening piece).  Lyle May's contributions on keyboards (& to the writing of most of the compositions) should also be noted.  Finally, although this album maintains interest throughout & really has no fillers (& never descends into the maudlin, over-produced schmaltz that to my mind tarnishes Speaking of Now), track 3 (Last Train Home) is sufficiently \\"easy listening\\" to not only be frequently heard as background music in elevators & shopping malls but give me a not too compelling reason to knock off a star (ok, make that just half a star!)  Definitely a good place to start one's exposure to Pat/PMG with the follow-up album (Letter From Home) also easily fitting into that category.
0143038419|5.0|What I liked most about Elizabeth Gilbert's book was her willingness to share her raw self with us. Her deepest darkest times, and her times of great joy, and everything else in between. She has great writing range, like an opera singer with great singing range.<br /><br />I found her writing hilarious at times and brought me to tears at times. A brilliant writer. Whenever I see her book on the book shelves, I smile with delight knowing that someone else will have the opportunity to laugh by surprise. My family kept asking me why was I laughing.<br /><br />Having also been to Italy, I was so glad to enjoy the country all over again through this book. I could go there again and again and never tire of it. Elizabeth, your book blessed me beyond measure. Can't wait to read another one.
0765316889|4.0|I just finished The Well of Ascension and I couldn't put it down.      This novel nicely expands on the promises & characters you grew to know and love in the first book. The team is left without their leader but they still have a country to run. What will they do? How will they respond to the needs of their people and what did the Lord Ruler's final words really mean?  Vin and Elend have to find out in time to save themselves and possibly the rest of the world.    While the book wasn't quite as fast paced as Mistborn (maybe just because I miss Kelsier and the entire savior/leader/rogue that he was), it sets us up for what I expect will be a mind blowing finale.
B000P2A24W|4.0|Having been a Bon Jovi fan since Slippery, I have come to anticipate new BJ cd's.  There were a few along the way that were not as strong, however, I'd say Lost Highway is a good competitor.<br /><br />The first half of the CD is phenominal!  You'll be singing along.  The second half, was a little disappointing, but not bad over-all.  I was leary of the country twang, however it fit very nicely!  And since I was a fan of \\"Who say's you can't go home\\", it made sense to me taking into account it's wide success why they've chosen to explore this route.  With \\"Who says you can't go home\\" being one of my all-time BJ fav's, this album provides \\"Lost Highway\\" as another to add to that list.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this CD to BJ fans, as well as country fans.  BJ fans might be worried, but it's not as \\"country\\" as you might fear.  Or at least I feel it fits in with the feel of the cd so that you barely notice the subtleties at times.
B000002952|5.0|This music reaches into your whole body and soul.  The lyrics and rythms are easy to listen and dance to.  Wonderfuly written and played.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|The additional 24 minutes of footage make this movie finally come together for the viewer.The scene of Tony's first  face to face meeting  with Mathilda , (glaringly absent from the first U.S. version)make one see how she could approach him with familiarity later.The restored scenes of Leon training Mathilda (in the use of firearms), and going on \\"cleaning\\" jobs, lends credibility to her having the idea she could take on the DEA. And  so on, and so on.I considered it a excellent film before,but it is much more coherent and understandable with the re-insertion of the missing scenes.******(6 Stars)
B000SM7QUC|3.0|I'm a little disturbed. I think I want my Mommy?!    The maddness of addiction and recovery in a song? As an entire album? You must be crazy?! Seriously, it allowed me to know a little bit more than I really wanted to know. It's Brilliantly painful to listen too because you know it's real. The listener is taken all the way through the Prelude, the Life Story, and the Epilogue of a life lived in chemical insanity. Musically, it's a little like the Trans-Siberian Orchestra on Super Dope meets \\"Stand By Me\\" on Street Junk in a cold dark alley and together they decided an album was necessary. It's nothing I've heard before, and that's a good thing! Musical Nightmares have a greater impact when they are original. The composing Musicians on this album have survived Sixx:A.M., let's pray they're alive for Sixx:30! Rock On and On!!!!!!!
B000TSIK14|5.0|As a fan for over 20 years (my first concert was the Scorpions in '88) I must say this is definitely the strongest record since Crazy World or even since Love at First Sting.  I and several of my friends who have been listening to an import copy of the album for a few months and agree that there are just no fillers on the album.  It is highly consistent and after owning more than 1300 CDs, one that I really am enjoying listening to over and over again.<br /><br />Some of us just didn't realize they had still had this in them.  I had expectations, but had kept them in check since it's hard to say how much fire and spark they can have after 35 years.  Yes, there were song doctors involved, namely Desmond Child and Marti Frideriksen, but the core of the songs sounds like Scorpions and I don't hold the collaboration against them - ultimately the CD delivers big time.<br /><br />All expectations have been blown away, the album is a masterpiece, no matter if it sells well in North America or not. Wow!
B000A2IPPK|5.0|What a great film.  Not a dull moment in the whole movie.  Thoroughly entertaining and very funny.
B000Q6GUT8|3.0|I realize that this movie was made prior to the release of the \\"Bourne Ultimatum\\" & Director Paul Greengrass has set the bar higher for this kind of intense action, so, to me, it feels like Antoine Fuqua missed the opportunity to make this a really great film. It was held back by mediocre writing and only somewhat better-than-average filming. It is the difference between showing and telling. One example, the director could have shown us the African massacre-pipeline-government connection so that we viewers could have connected the dots, but instead both the Johnson & Senator characters end up having to tell us, a couple of times, via dialogue what the connection was. This was Faqua's job and he didn't do it.<br /><br />Further, since Swagger is a serial character he had the chance to create buzz for future must-see Swagger films, but he just didn't do it. And that won't be Mark Wahlberg's fault. He, Pena and a few thrilling long range shots made this movie watchable. I just hope the Swagger franchise ends up in better hands. Then maybe we'll get the chance to really see what Wahlberg can do.
0767802470|5.0|This movie was EXCELLENT. Never thought I'd catch myself saying that about the German side of WW2. But it's true....    Director Petersen did a fantastic job with the set. I read somewhere it was the most expensive German movie of all time as of the late 80s...not sure if that still holds, but I wouldn't be surprised.  The cast is perfect - this is one of those films where the cast all comes together, from the Captain - the \\"Old Man\\" at about 30 yrs old - played to absolute perfection by Jurgen Prochnow, to his competent and harried Chief Engineer, to the slightly strange Johann (the Chief Mechanic), to the Bosun (a very believable NCO), to the Nazi \\"Number One\\" Watch Officer (nominally the 2nd in command, despite his obvious youth).    I have the VHS version, which is shorter than this Director's Cut. That sort of tipped me against the DVD Director's Cut, in that the voices are not dubbed quite the same. And there were several scenes in the Director's Cut that kind of distracted me, having gotten used to the VHS already. For example, the scenes between the young German sailor and his French girlfriend were ancillary to the basic story. The VHS tape I have does not show her live, only the sailor mulling over her photo.    The idea that German sailors were less-than-enthusiatic-Nazis actually has validity - it's said that Germany went to WW2 with a \\"people's Army, a National Socialist (Nazi) Luftwaffe, and an Imperial Navy\\". The point is that the Navy was the least \\"Nazi\\" of all the German services. It retained a lot of its old traditions.    In fact, there is scholarly speculation that if Hitler had delayed the war long enough for Germany to get the 200 submarines the Navy command (Admirals Raeder and Doenitz) knew they needed, it might indeed have changed the outcome of the western part of the European war. It most certainly would have delayed Allied victory. As it was, they started with less than 100 operational subs....Adolf Hitler never really understood or thought in terms of the \\"sea war\\".   Winston Churchill is said to have stated that the U-Boat force was the only thing he ever really feared about Germany.    The movie has an appropriate amount of drama, action, boredom, life at sea, and \\"leadership issues\\" to make this a completely believable story - at least as far as can be done in a couple hours movie. And, ultimately, the sub is sunk in port...    I rate this in the top five on my all-time favorite war movies. It is certainly the best submarine war movie ever made. Its right up there with Saving Private Ryan and others. And - it was done almost 20 years earlier ! In fact, we watched it in ROTC in 1983-84 as a sort of \\"professional development\\" lesson.
B00005V9IL|5.0|A definite sci-fi classic.  A masterpiee through and through.  One of James Cameron's best.  An underwater tale that does not disappoint.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but if you can, catch the Two Disc set.  the extras are magnificient.
B000002GZ1|2.0|this white boy blues stuff is so over-done. every band like this from this era all sound the same: boring, watered-down, stuck-in-the-same-groove, white-boy, schlock. pure torture!! sure, the PBBB, John Mayall, Clapton, etc, all did their part by bringing the underlying music (real blues) to the attention of a larger audience, which is not necessarily a good thing, but i can respect that they liked what they heard and copied it. fair enough. however, if you're looking for something that can be felt through your speakers and over time and space, check out Magic Sam, Howlin Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, or Lonnie Mack, or, if you like the older stuff, Son House, or RL Burnside. this 3rd generation blues stuff is soooo boring and predictable at this point.
0790729350|5.0|Fantastic DVD.. This really does capture the moment.. The current generation could do with giving this one a view!!    I wonder if anyone could tell me the name of the song that plays on this directors cut 9 mins 45 secs in..  The song plays over the imagery of the stage being set up..     The lyrics start with... If you smile at me.. il understand!!      Thanks in advance
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Once again Quentin Tarantino has taken several movie genres and smashed them together into something completely unique and original. Death Proof is an ingenious, if slowly-paced combination of slasher movie, car chase thriller and revenge flick. Just when you think you know where it's going, it veers off in a different direction (sometimes literally). For Tarantino fans, Death Proof will be absolutely delightful if you can get past the slow pace and extreme talkiness. Some people were bothered by the long stretches of dialog, but really that's what a slasher movie consists of. You meet the characters, then they chat about BS for about half an hour, then there's a kill. If you don't get to peek into the characters lives, you're not going to care about them when they are in jeopardy. The girls' performances and Tarantino's dialog make it far from intolerable.    All the Tarantino trademarks are present in Death Proof: stunning direction, shots of girls' feet, excellent use of music with old obscure pop songs, lots of dialog, and strong female heroines, but this time he throws a few new things into the mix. The setup of a slasher movie, Austin Texas flavor, and an amazing car chase. And if this movie doesn't make a star out of the great Zoe Bell, then there's truly no justice in the world. She is amazing. Zoe Bell alone makes Death Proof worth watching. She's just adorable and her climactic scene will have you on the edge of your seat. I must mention Kurt Russell too. This movie must be his best performance in ages. His Stuntman Mike is both exceedingly charming and frightening.     The DVD features the extended cut of Death Proof that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. As for the longer cut itself, I feel that it's definitely better than the shorter cut. There are several great new scenes that make the film an even richer experience. Kurt Russell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Vanessa Ferlito are all given more screentime which I think is a very good thing. MichaelParks' scene is longer, also a very good thing. There are more great details like the second group of girls' stop at a convenience store with Stuntman Mike not far behind. The longer film feels more complete to me, it feels more like a whole film. However, those that didn't like the shorter Death Proof certainly won't like the longer film any more.     As for the hubbub surrounding the DVD release, I say nonsense. It's probably a consequence of the film's low box office gross. Although Tarantino planned to release his preferred cut of Death Proof separately all along. I'm happy to be able to see Death Proof without having to sit through Planet Terror first. I'd much rather own the longer cut of the movie than just the theatrical version. I think Death Proof will work even better as a stand-alone feature film. I loved the theatrical movie but it worked best at the movie theater. Grindhouse just won't be quite the same on the small screen. So it makes sense to release Planet Terror and Death Proof separately. Perhaps someday in the future people will realize that they missed a completely unique and exciting moviegoing experience and the film will be rereleased in theaters. Until then, I'm happy to have the DVDs of the two movies.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|This quite possibly has risen to be one of my favorite albums that I own and I literally listen to this album and band pretty much every day and they just don't seem to grow old, everyday I become a bigger fan of Amon Amarth.    With Oden On Our Side combines great melodic, violent and sometimes ambient from Amon Amarth. Most of the songs are based on Norse mythology and brutal songs of murder and war. Johan Hegg has a very brutal growl but his vocals are easy to decipher than other death metal vocals. Olavi Mikkonan and Johan deliver some great melodic riffs and better solos on this one. Fredrik Andersson does not go overboard with the double bass but there is plenty of well mathed use of it and Ted Lundstom has good bass-lines.     My favorite songs are Cry of the Blackbirds(reason enough to get this album) Runes to my Memory, Valhall Awaits me, With oden on our side, Gods of war Arise, Prediction of Warfare and Under the Northern Star.    Get this album.
B00003BDXG|5.0|A crazy, zany movie that looks as if it only got made after the inmates took over the asylum.  Quentin Tarantion penned a script that Stone and his associates bought and remade into what we now know as Natural Born Killers.  A crazy film that needs to be seen multiple times to understand.  Once is definitely not enought.    The movie's point is hidden behind the violence and gore but it's very effective in its message.  It's a movie that needs no explaining.  The title itself makes it one to watch.  The scenes, the angles, the characters, you will not forget this movie if you see it.    The DVD features a commentary from Oliver Stone, a few deleted scnes, including a shocking one with Ashley Judd that'll leave you in awe, and a feturette.    The bad thing is, it's non-anamorphic.  This is the only Director's Cut that I know of and it sucks that it's not anamorphic.    However, I still recommend this movie.
0974869449|5.0|JLPT grouping complements most Japanese language study materials very well. The stroke order and excellent vocabulary selection of these cards closed me. This product certainly deserves 5 stars, but I would vote \\"6\\" if all joyo kanji were covered in subsequent volumes.
B00000I2PG|5.0|If you are a fan of the early 80's New Wave sound, ABC The Lexicon of Love is one you should have. Amazing production and wonderfully written songs.   Get it!
B00005JPKE|4.0|Okay, so don't expect the intensity of the battle scenes of Saving Private Ryan or the surrealism of Full Metal Jacket Here. Once I got over my pre-conceptions about what a \\"war movie\\" was supposed to be like, I was fine. Also, if you like happy/neat endings...this is not the movie for you. What you will find is a war movie in which you care about the characters and feel torn about many of the issues/dillemas presented. You will vacilate greatly over the course of the movie: one moment disgust/shock, the next admiration/reverence. So, if you are up for a non-traditional war movie, and a roller coaster of emotions, give it a spin.
B00006IUL7|5.0|Christopher Nolan's third feature film ([[ASIN:B00000F3CD Following]], [[ASIN:B0000640SA Memento (Widescreen Two-Disc Limited Edition)]]) is as good as his first two.

0375805613|5.0|This is such a cute little story - such a fun book to read as it has many opportunities to add character in your voice fluctuation.  It is smaller in size so it travels easily.  This was one of my favorites as a child.
B000PY52EU|4.0|Once you get over the initial seemingly ridiculous plotline of this film there is a lot of enjoyment to be had.  Christina Ricci plays an incredibly brave role as a nymphomaniac who is left for dead on the side of the road after one two many sexual trists. Samuel L Jackson plays the damaged but moral rescuer who chains her to the radiator in his house and attempts to cure her wicked ways. There is some great tunes in this film with ol Samuel belting out some of his own along the way which i must admit is pretty darn good. Justin Timberlake again impresses as the anxiety ridden and troubled boyfriend of Ricci's character whose actions will have consequences for everybody. As silly as it sounds this film is well written and terrifically performed and has a very moral and decent undercurrent flowing throughout and has a lot to say about the healing power of love and care and redemption. Recommended for those who are after something a bit different and not just an excuse to watch Christina Ricci wonder around half naked for most of the film.
B000E6EHGI|5.0|I found this for my 26yr. old son and he just loved it! Thanks so much!
B00003CXXP|5.0|One of the most misunderstood movies of all time.  David is a robot that develops a \\"bond\\" with his \\"mother\\"  A perfectly crafted movie from the brain of Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick.  It's a movie that will make both of them proud.    This is a movie that frustrates more than it profounds.  It's a delightful movie with a wonderful performance from Haley Joel Osment.    This Two-Disc Set is definitely worth it.  It includes hours of features and some nice interviews.  Plus the movie looks amazing.    It's definitely recommended.
1582701709|1.0|Job was a good man. He was righteous in the eyes of the Lord. Yet, his wife and children died, his wealth disappeared, and hideous boils covered his body, leaving him sitting on a dung heap, left to ponder the meaning of his existence while his three self-righteous friends accuse him of sinfulness, since--of course!--anyone suffering misfortunate must be receiving punishment from God for something he did.Job pleaded with God for an answer. `Why, oh Lord, must I suffer?' God gives Job no answer. God points out the simple truth that He, God, is creator of the world. It is His place, and His alone, to know. It is Job's job (so to speak) to shut up, get on with his life, and keep his faith in the Lord.<br /><br />If, say, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson were to rewrite the Book of Job, they might substitute God's silent answer with Jack Handey's response to a little kid's question about rain, `why is God crying?': \\"Because of something you did.\\" Falwell and Robertson, after all, were the guys who blamed 9/11 not on the people who actually flew the planes into the World Trade Center, but on God pulling his providential hand of protection away from America because of the gays, feminists, secularists, and friends.<br /><br />The response of the American people to these two preachers was a collective `what are they thinking?' Yet, the wisdom of the Book of Job is lost on many, not just fundamentalist preachers. Just look at the latest New Age fad, Rhonda Byrne's New York Times best selling book and Oprah favorite \\"The Secret.\\"<br /><br />The Secret consults great thinkers across the fields of psychology, physics, medicine, philosophy, and education to reveal the hidden truth about the greatest force in the Universe. Is this great force gravity? Is it any of the other laws of physics? Is this great force God, for the religiously inclined? No, it is none of these things. The most powerful force in the Universe is YOU!<br /><br />That's right, you are more powerful than gravity, the speed of light, a Nolan Ryan fastball, a teenage boy's body odor. You are even more powerful than God. There is this mystical thing out there called the Law of Attraction. It says that whatever you are attracted to will be given to you. Let's say I am attracted to--I don't know--Jessica Alba. My attraction will send energy waves out into the universe and bring Jessica Alba to me since nothing is more powerful than the Law of Attraction. Are Jessica and I currently together? You'll have to wait and see; first, there is a book review to finish.<br /><br />Do you want wealth? Envision yourself being rich, and it will happen. Do you want a nice job? Imagine that cushy desk, fancy computer, and stunning secretary, and it will all be yours. Do you want to improve your golf game? Picture that ball rolling onto the green for a hole-in-one, and you will be the next Tiger Woods.<br /><br />`Ah,' a detractor might say, `but what about the people who don't get what they want? What about the poor schmucks who get what they don't desire?' The Law of Attraction is still in play, says Rhonda Byrne. Whatever you are envisioning or thinking about will come to you through the Law of Attraction. A person who loses his job may say he doesn't like unemployment, but when he was thinking, `I don't want to lose my job,' his energy field sent out vibes attracting that job loss. You see, the Law of Attraction may be the most powerful force in the Universe, but it has trouble reading certain words in the dictionary. The Law of Attraction does not understand negative words like \\"no,\\" \\"don't,\\" \\"can't,\\" and \\"won't.\\"<br /><br />Imagine yourself walking down the street after a nice meal at the local Mexican restaurant. That pretty girl from your high school class (whom you haven't seen in years) randomly walks by. You start a nice conversation, catch up on life, but all of a sudden, the beginnings of Montezuma's Revenge appear. You let out that wet fart. Inside, you say to yourself, `pleaseGod! Don't let this one smell.' But the Law of Attraction does not hear \\"no.\\" The Law of attraction hears `let this one smell.'

B00005JPLW|5.0|SUCH AN AMAZING MOVIE!!!!!    the action scenes (the entire movie) were so awesome!    very artsy!    loved it
B000VDDDY6|3.0|This looks like an incredible package, and might, like the Twilight Zone Definitive Editions, become \\"the\\" set to have for Star Trek Fans - but the price, which has been cited in reviews, is definately a bit steep - I spent two birthdays and a Christmas getting the $124.99 sets in Standard Definiton only to watch the retail on all 3 drop the following year to half the price I was gifted for.      At Amazon's discount price, it's definately THE way to buy the set.  I've seen some of the remastered episodes as well and they're definately neat to watch.    But at full price? I'd wait.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The Star Wars Trilogy is still one of the best trilogies ever made.  Three of the best movies ever produced.  Wonderful and took the world by storm in the late seventies.  A cultural icon that propelled George Lucas into stardom.    The magic is still here 30 years later.  I don't care if you don't like them or not, you owe it to yourself to watch these movies.  I did and I loved them.    Each movie features a commentary track with a number of people.  The Bonus Disc features a few documentaries and featurettes I suggest that all fans should view.    Highly recommended.

B000RJO578|3.0|This is one of those movies where the only good parts were what was shown in the trailer!    the trailer showed awesome actiona and witty humor but the movie ended up being some weird comical thriller that was ok.    if it werent for the ending i would have given this 1 start but the ending saved it with its great action and turnaround.    it was ok
0140557741|5.0|I found this book at the library and knew nothing about it, so when I opened it up, I got to experience it without the foreknowledge of what I was about to see.  As a result I got to experience the enjoyment of each surprising page turn.  If you get this book, don't spoil it by reading anything about it, just open to page one and enjoy the ride.  Such a fun book for any age.  I loved it as much as my six year old did.  Mr. Banyai has a wonderfully creative mind, and this is definitely one of my most favorite wordless picture books.
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority Report is a sci-fi thriller that poses the question, if you haven't commited a crime yet, how can you be charged for it.

Well crafted, beautiful, and a fun ride as well.  Steven Spielberg crafts yet another wonderful movie to watch.  You won't be disappointed.    Highly recommended.

B00005JPQT|4.0|Techies prove a point in this national security nightmare action drama, when a home grown terrorist masterminds a plan to shut down the entire country, one network at a time.<br /><br />Of course you can figure out that the one thing he forgot to factor into his programme was Detective John McClane, who is still around, albeit a little older, but still an ornery, stubborn, annoying pain in the rear, and as it turns out, still a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />An analog guy in a high tech world, McClane is sent to pick up and deliver a computer hacker named Matt Farrell to the FBI, but as was the case in 16 Blocks, the delivery isn't as simple as it sounds.  Unknown at the time to McClane and Farrell, somebody's been deleting the great hackers of America, and there are no prizes for guessing who's up next.<br /><br />To quote lyrics from Cypress Hill:<br /><br />\\"Boom biddy bye bye<br />Boom biddy bye bye<br /><br />Step back as I'm kicking up dust<br />For a while<br />As I put mothaf***as to rest<br />And pull their files\\"<br /><br />Predictably, McClane sets off to get the bad guys, and although a whole lot of the movie is mind-numbing techie stuff, with people accessing protected systems with consummate ease, the rest of it is action, action, action, with eye popping CGI, and mega-destruction.<br /><br />Even if you're digitally challenged like myself and get lost in the cyber-warfare, the explosions and high octane scenes are more than enough to make you go \\"WHOAH!\\"<br /><br />\\"Boom biddy bye bye<br />It's time to die<br />Boom biddy bye bye<br />Time to say good-bye\\"<br /><br />The next best thing to Die Hard, and a must-see for action buffs.<br /><br />Rated: 4.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 4, 2007
B000QUCNOK|3.0|Try as I might I could not think of a non punning title for this review but at least I stayed away from \\"Scent of a Woman.\\" With that said I feel that Tom Tykwer has done an admirable job in bringing Patrick Suskind's unfilmable (to use Kubrick's words) novel to the screen.    The film follows Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), an outcast with an incredible sense of smell throught 18th Century Paris. Grenouille uses his gift in order to find recognition and possibly even love and acceptance from those around him. Unfortunately he does it in the wrong way, he becomes a serial killer obsessed with making the perfect perfume. This perfume being created from the distilled essence of virgins.    Along the way he is apprenticed to master perfumer Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman)who teaches him his craft and starts Grenouille on his macabre journey. There is also some fine acting on display from Alan Rickman as Richis the father of Grenouille's final victim.    This is a film that relies heavily on its production design (Uli Hanisch) and its cinematography (Franke Griebe) in order to make the viewer feel and smell the sights and sounds of a filthy urban sprawl that was 18th century Paris. The novel was deemed unfilmable because it was thought that no film could capture this feel. Tykwer did a very good job even if the film is a little overlong for its own good. While the plot may not stand up to close scrutiny it does provide an interesting few hours in the dark. Many have commented on the strange ending but I feel that the ending helps the film reach its ultimate resolution. All said maybe the recognition that we seek is not what is in our best interests after all.    This is a provacative and intelligent horror film that many missed on its theatrical release. Give it a try. You may be glad you did for the acting and design alone.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This is a decent movie.  it could have been better on a lot of levels but it is definitely a good movie to check out.  If you're looking for A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi, this ain't it.<br /><br />It's a different movie.  Not as action packed as those but definitely worth a look.  I actually prefer this to Attack of the Clones, mostly because of Hayden Christensen,  Jar Jar Binks is an annoyance but you'll learn to live with it.  If he didn't talk as much it'd be a very good movie.<br /><br />Alas, I still recommend this movie.  The DVD is great.  A commentary from George and others and a few features on the second disc make it all the worthwhile.  The deleted scenes are a must watch.  Definitely for the fans.  If you aren't a fan, you won't appreciate it as much.
B0002IU988|5.0|This album is like a fresh sound to Creed, but a lot different in a way. So good and full of talent. Great songs!!<br />Remember Alter bridge is not only tremonti from creed, alter bridge is Creed without scott. This band has such sweet vocals, he really can sing. All the songs on this album are rich in talent and feelings. Get it, It's quality people, quality... Their new album black bird will hit stores October 9 07!!
B00003CXMG|5.0|This is a well-done movie about an almost-famous rock<br />band touring in the seventies as seen through the eyes<br />of an almost-employed young journalist who's been hired<br />to follow them.<br />Most of the characters are expectable if not exactly pre-<br />dictable. The surprise-and for me, the delight-of this movie<br />is the depiction of the young, drifting groupie. Kate Hudson<br />pulls off the perfect combination of toughness, vulnerability<br />and romantic dreaminess.<br />In the very masculine world of rock movies, this depiction of<br />a young woman stands out not just for its rarity but for the<br />contrast of her many-layered humanity with the testosterone-<br />fueled excess of the rest of the cast.<br /><br />In the very best sense, this is a superb chick flick about a<br />remarkable woman.<br /><br />--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE  and<br />the novel bang BANG.

0345494997|4.0|Because this is a novel, the reader can take for granted that plenty of the details are imagined, as the author could not possibly have been privy to the conversations or situations described here, not to the extent portrayed. But I urge readers NOT to be put off by the fact that this is fiction because it is clear that the author did her research. I found this book to be very interesting, very well written and it revealed a part of Wright's life I hadn't really known about.<br /><br />  Mamah Borthwick Cheney was a married woman who had an affair with Wright, also married at the time. She is credited (if \\"credit\\" is the right word) with destroying his first marriage. Anyone expecting to pick up this book and sink into an epic love story should be forewarned - this is NOT the stuff of dreamy romance novels, but the hard, gritty reality of an affair during a time when women weren't expected to break the bonds of convention. It also isn't an easy read at times, as it has some slow passages, which is the main reason I gave it a 4 rating instead of a 5.<br /><br />  Here is the reality behind the fiction: Cheney met Wright when she and her husband commissioned the architect to design a house for them. This is not an airy or stereotypical romance but a portrayal of an independent, educated woman at odds with the restrictions of the early 20th century. Frank and Mamah, both married and with children, met when Mamah's husband, Edwin, commissioned Frank to design a house.<br /><br />  This is what the book focuses on, the affair between the two. But I think there is information potential readers need, information that helps to put things in deeper perspective and perhaps lend a backstory to the events.<br /><br />  For one thing, Wright's own father, a minister, had divorced his wife, citing alienation of affection even though SHE was the one who'd asked him to leave, according to many accounts. I think family history is important, often a key component in shaping one's life, depending on how events are interpreted, the trauma that may be endured and the legacy of pain or resilience left in its wake.<br /><br />  So I'm noting that Wright came from a family that was troubled, had a long history of marital tension before the divorce (his father struggled to make a living). Who knows what part this played in Frank Lloyd Wright's history of flirtations, long before he met Cheney? All of these factors - the divorce within his family, Wright's reputation as a flirt (some say a womanizer) and the fact that he already had 6 children which took up most of his wife's attention may have played pivotal roles in the affair itself. It is certainly important background info.<br /><br />  The author writes very well (most of the time) about the affair itself and events that were considered scandalous, even making headlines: how Wright and Cheney left their families, lived together, traveled overseas and more.<br /><br />  There is more I want to tell but if I do I will absolutely ruin the book for readers who don't know the whole story or haven't heard the complete tale of this affair. The book leads up to stunning event and I don't feel I should spoil the book by revealing more.<br /><br />  I will say that if you are the sort of reader who likes nice, neat and happy endings or romances, then you may feel let down at the end. I was fascinated by the whole saga. This is a major and epic novel, kept from being absolutely superb, in my opinion, by a few pacing issues. Even so, I'd recommend it for the strengths that shine through and for revealing a major episode in the noted architect's life. I'd definitely buy another book by this author, someone I expect to get better as she continues to write. She already has so much talent!<br /><br />  I'd also suggest readers do some research AFTER reading the book if they are interested in Wright's complete life story. If you do too much research beforehand, you'll find out what happens in this book and that may take away from the suspense.se.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I went to see this movie with my friends.  I didn't even know what movie we would be seeing, I just went to be with them.  At the end of the movie I was so moved, I could have cried.  This movie is beautiful, powerful, and the acting is top notch.    Not only do Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore give wonderful performances, but the supoirting cast of Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, Dustin Hoffman, and the other boys are just as magical.  A brilliant film from start to finish and easily, one of the best of 2004.  An absolutely wonderful move for all ages.    The DVD features A Filmmaker's Commentary, Deleted Scenes, Outtakes, and a few featurettes.  I definitely recommend this movie.  A delight for all ages.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|This is definitely not a Hollywoodian movie. How about seeing it as a story about karma, negative karma, action and reaction. If  you think of it (provided you have seen this movie), you will realize that the Japanese portion of the story is actually central to all the events, which originate in the Japanese executive. Karma continues to play its devastating role throughout the movie, across all the countries and cultures portrayed.    Having lived for over 10 years in Morocco, I can say that the Moroccan actors did a fabulous job, that the settings were extremely well chosen and looked authentic (I didn't live in the southern Moroccan mountains where this movie was partly shot, so I can't witness to the 100% authenticity of setting).     As for the actors, one of the best roles for Brad Pitt, which he performed perfectly. All of the actors did a superb job. Coming to this movie without any notion of its plot or setting (sorry I was so ignorant!), I was swept off my feet. Highly recommended.

B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie was the best movie that I ever saw, it instantly became one to my favorite movies.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This is a favorite of mine.  Billy Wilder made a perfect movie.  One that is entertaining and has some of the best acting I've ever seen.  William Holden plays his part perfectly and Gloria Swanson is just magic in her role.  The entire cast is wonderful.  A movie like this makes me proud, this was long before actors required millions just to do a movie and gave subpar performances.    This movie details Hollywood before Hollywood was the Hollywood we know of now.  Yet the message rings true to this day.  A wonderful movie to say the least.  Highly recommeded.  Actually, I recommend any and every Billy Wilder movie.  A true genius.

B000O75F7C|3.0|I wanted to try this one out having read some great reviews and finding out Fripp and Lifeson guest star. I like the concept of the album- the fear that we are creating a vacant uninvolved younger generation. I think this is  a very powerful analysis of modern day society where kids are becoming slaves to the computer and TV bombarded by tons of useless information. The music however, is very mellow and I find very little resembling prog although you can argue there are some prog embellishments. For the most part the music is straight forward. I'm glad that they have gone away from the Pink Floyd imitators to something more original. But , in the end the songs just are not that moving nor powerful. I respect Wilson for his production abilities with Opeth. But, I'm still not on the Porcupine Tree bandwagon. I just don't hear the prog. Good moments include Anesthetize and My Ashes.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Before Jaws, Steven Spielberg had only directed two movies.  The first was a made for TV movie, [[ASIN:B000063UR5 Duel (Collector's Edition)]], ad the other was the low budget, comedic Goldie Hawn true story [[ASIN:B00028HBIE The Sugarland Express]].  So you could understand why no one expected Jaws to be a hit.<br /><br />But it was, becoming the first movie to gross more than $100 million at the box office and firmly cementing Speilberg's place as a filmmaker.  Not only did he create an effective and terrifying tale.  He created a movie that still gives some goosebumps 30 years later.<br /><br />Still as refreshing as the day it was first shown, Jaws is a classic.  The DVD features a two hour making of feature and a few deleted scenes.  It also has a documentary and a few other fun things.  The big draw will be the 60 page Commemorative Booklet.  Full of Jaws facts from here to there.<br /><br />Definitely a must for all Spielberg and Jaws fans.

B000RO9PXC|4.0|As with all of the Bright Midnight releases, this release is intended more as a historical document than a perfect musical experience.  If you're looking for the perfect \\"cut and paste\\" show, you should go check out the \\"In Concert\\" set.  If you're looking for the best quality full show that's available at the moment (I say at the moment because there are rumblings of the Felt Forum shows being released in their entirety sometime next year), go get \\"Live in Detroit\\" (an amazing show, I only wish that I could have been there).<br /><br />If you are a serious fan of The Doors, you'll like this.  It definitely shows a sign of Jim Morrison that has not been seen before in the previous releases by the band.  Yes, he is drunk and slurs his speech.  He still has his strong moments, though.  In the liner notes, Bruce Botnick (the album producer) states \\"The opening scream going into 'Roadhouse Blues' from the first show is stunning and worth the price of admission alone.\\"<br /><br />Overall, it's still a fun listen, even humorous at times (such as when Jim Morrison puts the microphone in his mouth), especially if you are a true Doors fan.  This will be displayed next to my other Bright Midnight releases with pride (even if the packaging is a bit iffy).

B000002USN|2.0|It pains me to think how many people have probably never heard a Sinatra album apart from this one -- or worse yet, heard this and, based on how weak it is, decided not to explore further.  It's one thing to hear the 78-year-old Frank in less than stellar voice, because he can make magic even with the limited tools at his disposal.  \\"One For My Baby\\" (which is unfortunately attached to Kenny G's insipid tootling on an instrumental \\"All The Way\\" in a medley of sorts) is one of the most moving performances of his entire career.  It's also the only track on which he sings alone.<br /><br />The duet partners on the other dozen tunes, at best, do nothing to make the songs better, and at worst, drag them down horribly.  Luther Vandross, Bono, Luis Miguel, Liza Minnelli and the others are all fine singers on their own, but they don't belong on a Sinatra album.  There's precious little chemistry here between Frank and any of his duet \\"partners,\\" which isn't surprising considering none of them were recorded in the same room.<br /><br />If you're a Sinatra completist, you should own this CD.  If not, you should think twice before picking it up -- especially if you don't already own his brilliant Capitol and Reprise recordings from the '50s and '60s (the '40s stuff on Columbia is great, too).  And if you can find it, try to get hold of \\"Duets For One,\\" a bootleg CD featuring 15 of Sinatra's \\"Duets\\" recordings without the overdubbed pseudo-duets.  As a document of his last studio recordings, it's pretty great, and we can only hope that one day it will be released officially.
B000I2J79K|5.0|There are very few ocasions when two of your favorite groups play together.  Well, after more than 30 years these two did!  Nothing else needs to be added, this is a GREAT show.  The first thing that you notice is the huge ammount of songs.  That by itself more than justifies the purchase.  Then, you realize that not only they play together at the end, but they invite vocalists from each group to sing with the other group in several tracks.  Also, for pure music lovers, they included a drum duel between both band drummers as a bonus.<br />Then there is the technical side of the disc.  At first I was a little dissapointed to know that it is a 720p, 1080i recording; but believe me, the image is simply STUNNING.  The sound is just perfect.  I play HD-DVDs on an XBOX 360 Elite and there is absolutely no problem with it.<br />Higly recommended.

0553584537|5.0|Edge of the seat reading is Lisa Gardner's style in all her books.  Not only does she deliver an excellent mystery, but she always teaches or educates about something in her books.  I always hate to fall asleep as I want to stay up all evening and finish her books.  She's great!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I was sitting there, watching him watching her. Hoping that she would look back. I even repeated the same words he did. (I know that sounds funny but I love the character of Mr. Thornton). I didn't think I would love him especially when he beats a worker for smoking inside his mill at the beginning, but that just shows how much he cares about his workers that he doesn't want innocent men, women and children to die recklessly (especially after the way his father died, he understands suffering and loss and doesn't want a stupid,reckless, and unnecessary fire to take lives of innocent people trying to make a living and survive as best they know how.   After this scene, I knew that Mr. Thornton would have to work overtime for me to like him or even sympathize with him. Boy was I wrong! I could not keep my eyes off of him. Who knew that seriousness and brooding was so sexy?? And the precious moments where Mr. Thornton actually smiles are PRICELESS!! I could not watch only one episode. I was glued to the spot and watched all four episodes in one night. And until the end, i was keeping my fingers crossed for the two souls that had to meet and then part to understand what love is and that THEY had IT!     Richard is amazing in this as is Daniela. The chemistry between them is very believable. I got goosebumps when their fingers touch for a brief moment. It is moments like those that take the viewers breath away and transport you to their world. A world divided by differences,pride, misunderstanding but united by one strong tie- LOVE!!     If I could give North and South more stars, I would! It is absolutely amazing..riveting. The scenery is so dark in the North and so lively in the country yet i find myself favoring and loving the North, perhaps because of a certain jewel of a man named John?! ;)This movie is a jewel itself. A priceless one at that so please please see it. It will become a favorite for you, I'm sure of it! Watch their story... Experience their love!     AMAZING MOVIE!!!!!!!
B000QUCNP4|5.0|This was a very suspenseful movie.  I liked it also because it was a true story.  I recommend this movie highly!
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is one of the best stories I know that illustrate our ambivalence toward nature and the assortment of conflicting human natures including greed and reverence.  Why the title is about a princess when the major subject is a prince is somewhat mystifying to me.  Still, the story is well done and the illustrations superb.  The major drawback is that it is rather long for many audiences.  Overall, I have to consider it among the top movies I have ever seen.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away blends many themes together nicely in a tale bound to captivate.  It conveys nicely the idea that humans are not far away from a spirit world or an animal world since spirits can transform into human figures and humans can talk to animals (such as spiders).  And radishes can be Honorable. The story conveys notions of love, compassion, evil, good, human frailty, loneliness, meanness, etc. etc. all the while treating us to terrific illustrations.  What a gift!  Miyazaki truly is a master.
B000V39KDO|5.0|watched this movie a few days back and you can bet your bottom dollar that i'll definately be watching it again!    where do i start? the story? the action? the visuals? this movie made me sit on the edge of my seat and actually made me hold my breath at certain scenes, the last time this happened, i was watching the matrix!    this movie is going to set a precedant for future epics, just wait a see...    do yourselves a favour and watch this movie, just brilliant!
0810993139|5.0|I brought my 12-year-old son to the store to find a book, and we came home with this one.  He doesn't care to read, but he has to meet a certain quota for school.  As soon as we got home, he sat in bed and read 50 pages.  Then he woke up the next morning and read it during breakfast.  He feels he can relate to the character and finds the drawings amusing.  Finally, a book I didn't have to nag at him to read!
1554072840|4.0|Wording: The author uses different words for body parts and functions than our family uses, but that's an easy fix.  Change the words as you read it.  No author is going to use the same words everyone uses.  Plus, maybe these are the popular words in Isreal (where the author lives).  I'm an RN, we talk to people about elimination every day.  You'd be amazed at the terms people (even adults) use.  As a parent, relax, be flexible, and roll with it.    Art:  Eye of the beholder.  I like the way these pictures look.  More like a combo of drawing and collage.  There's been some complaints about the picture of urine and stool on the floor.  There are similar \\"accident\\" pictures in every potty book.  Kids have accidents (lucky for me, so far we've only had urine accidents).  Teach kids it's part of learning this new milestone.  The \\"pot\\" looks like a pitcher.  We use a potty seat not a potty chair.  Maybe I'm lucky, but my daughters have never been fazed by any books where the characters are not using the same type of seat as they do.    It's a bit wordy: We are trying to get our daughter closer to 100% potty trained.  But at 3, she's old enough to sit through it.      Bottom line:  My child likes it.  That's who this whole process is all about.  If it helps get her to 100% I'll read it to her twice a day every day.
B0000797IO|3.0|This is sort of a confused (not confusing) movie: It's not really as funny as a comedy and it's a little too absurd to be a drama.  How many mistakes can one woman make in her life?    Jennifer Aniston is more appealing as a girl-next-door, even one with a limited perspective and questionable judgment, than as one of the many incarnations of Rachel, but her character's lack of insight seems remarkable for a woman of 30.  The other characters are more interesting and even the weird ones--confused Phil, creepy Bubba, and unbalanced and delusional Tom/Holden--are less irritating.  The ending is not necessarily happy but at least it makes sense.
1596680199|5.0|Finally a book dedicated to nothing but making beads from Polymer Clay.  The step by step instructions are so easy to follow and the examples are incredible.  This is a must have book to any serious bead maker and jewelry maker alike.
0316166685|4.0|I just finished reading the book and a part of me wishes that I didn't. It's a great book and it was written well. I was looking for another book to read and a friend suggested this to me. I took up the advice and did some reasearch, I found it at the library and I brought it home. I started reading it.     I couldn't put the book down it and that's not in a good way. I started reading the novel and right away the protagonist, Susie Salmon starts to explain her life, she then explains how she was brutally raped and eventually murdered by her deranged neighbor Mr.Harvey. It was so disturbing how she described her death, as I was reading the description my heart sank. It was so cruel, how could a man do that to a young teenager? As she was describing the event, it was so vivid I felt as though I was there watching it happen, but I couldn't do anything about it.      Eventually her mother who was a few hundred feet away started looking for her and as her mother yelled her name, that was when Susie Salmon was killed. FLASHING FOREWORD to the future, she is in heaven, and she is missing out on being a human on earth. Throughout the story she watches the lives of her parents, siblings, love interest, friends, and her killer's unfold, ever since the dissapearence of her. Her parents won't give up hope that their daughter is gone forever, this event sabatoges their relationship as a husband and wife, they break up. She also experiences a lot of emotions, several distinct events occur both on heaven and on earth. The end of the book leaves you speechless. It's a great book, but nobody should read it if they don't like sad stories. If you are looking for a happy story with a happy ending look elsewhere and stay away from this book. But if you are looking for a good book, and don't care about how sad it is, then you should read this. But it's definitly recommended for older teens-adult.
0061122092|5.0|Pilar grows-up becoming a lovely, strong independent woman! Her childhood friend has become some more handsome, charismatic spiritual leader, making use of his religion as a refuge from his raging inner conflicts. He is said to be one who is even able to heal persons!    This lovely crafted story begins like a poetic narrative until Pilar is introduced to the gripping surprise of her lover having become a Seminarian. His whole life has been turned into an adventure shaped by his studies and new committment! When the italicised poetry becomes more narrative, the story moves more quickly and has numerous fascinating twists and turns. \\"It's risky falling in love.\\" Their love simply moves gradually into new adventures and amzing enw pictures of their interesting culture!     Although I had read early on THE ALCHEMIST by Coelho, this story grew more lovely and compelling the more I read. It is well-worth discovery as another winner by Paulo Coelho. In-spite of the reviews making far too much of its strong religion that Spanish flavor of Cathoicism is totally tempered by pictures of beautiful love-making!    As I discovered after reading other stories of Authur Golden, Memoirs Of A GEISHA and Rosamunde Pilcher, The Shell Seekers this story seemed to stay with me longer to become another model of poetic beauty and pictures an eternal love spanning this world and the one of the Great-Not-Yet! Gratefully from Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
B00005JPLW|5.0|This movie is truly epic! From story, to visuals, to acting, and sheer scale, there is no better word than epic! The movie is shot beautifully; everything from majestic landscapes, to visually stunning contrasts, to gritty, bloody hand-to-hand combat. 300 is a masterpiece work, flawless in execution. The story is tight and well paced, perfectly balancing a drama that shows a human side to the characters, mixed with a little political intrigue, and an intense action flick! This movie will surely not disappoint.
1400032717|5.0|In Haddon's exploration and evocation of autism, we directly enter the mind of the autistic hero, Christopher. We listen and feel with him as he describes a terrifying universe that is beyond any logic he understands. Actions utterly trivial to \\"normal\\" people become strange and profoundly confusing; events that upset \\"normal\\" people Christopher ignores; feelings that \\"normal\\" people name and live with are sources of horror and fear but never joy.    Written in the first person, Haddon's novel is a diary-apologia for its 15-year old hero. By spelling out what Christopher sees and feels, the novel *places to the margins* all the things that we \\"normal\\" people think are or should be at the center of a realistic novel. These include his father's affair with Mrs. Shears across the street, his mother's uneducated, needy letters to her son written after she has left him and his father to live with a man in London, the ending where Christopher and Mom are reunited. These soap-opera, tear-jerky cliches of the popular novel slide past Christopher, and he never understands them. He notes them in the same way he sees shapes in clouds or knows the names of all the capital cities in the world - merely facts existing in a jumble of no interest to him. Christopher is lost in what Bruno Bettelheim called \\"the silent fortress\\" of autism, and it is THAT silent world that Haddon creates for us in the novel.    The most remarkable sequence in the book is perhaps Christopher's trip to London by himself to find his mother. It is described in detail, and we see trains, timetables, police officers, and streets as inexplicable, illogical places of raw terror. Christopher navigates this maze of horror, and yet experiences and expresses no triumph. He finds his mother, and yet there is no joy. He returns home, but feels no relief or safety. The diary-apologia form of the novel *eradicates* such feelings (and cliches), and instead we hear only Christopher himself. In Haddon's novel, Bettelheim's fortress *does* speak, and its language is a voice of chilling terror - not the terror of a trendy vampire novel or a sci-fi flick or even a war movie, but of boy for whom this world is deadly.    We feel sad for him, but Christopher has no names for feelings like sadness, love, or intimacy. If we want to congratulate him at his triumph, he rejects us as surely as he rejects his mother when she tries, tearfully, to take his hand. Instead, he screams: her needs for a loving son are unfulfilled. At the end, Haddon leaves open the question of whether or not Christopher will ever be healed. There is no Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School - where Bettelheim developed treatments for autistic children - to receive Christopher. Instead, his diary-apologia remains locked in the world of Christopher's own mind.    So, no, the novel does not have a \\"happy ending.\\" Instead, it is a first-rate evocation and exploration of utter alienation and feelingless raw existence. At the start, Christopher painstakingly (and painfully) explains what a \\"metaphor\\" is - and Haddon's novel ultimately *is* a metaphor. But it's a metaphor for US, because in the end it is *our* world that Christopher lives in. In the end, WE are Christopher.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|Fuqua has turned Hunter's thoughtful book into a nutcake leftist fantasy where the baddies are all greedy, piglike Republicans. It could still have been otherwise entertaining, but the result is neither terribly thrilling nor intelligent; unlike the book, the action doesn't showcase Swagger's smarts, and his sidekick dons a Che T-shirt - perhaps to honor the gay-killing murderer? Fans of Hunter's books (and Fuqua's previous movies) will be repulsed by this rabid drivel.
0671015206|4.0|The statistical majority of millionaires operate in ways contrary to typical expectations. In fact, millionaires build and maintain wealth precisely because they defy those assumptions. People presume that millionaires must live and spend lavishly -- the surprise twist is that the ones acting that role are typically pretenders. They're actually under-accumulators who consume their way to impoverishment. Under-accumulators live a lifestyle they can't afford and end up unable to fund comfortable retirement.<br /><br />If your goal is to live in a custom home, play in exclusive clubs and resorts, and drive exotic cars, The Millionaire Next Door is probably not for you. But if your goal is to provide for your financial future and retire worry-free, this book shows how the top 1% are building their wealth. It doesn't detail the mechanics of how to invest and manage your money. It shows that the rich are wealthy because of their frugal habits.<br /><br />The concepts admittedly sound familiar after the first score of pages, and after many more iterations sound repetitive. Still the ideas are worth knowing and passing on.

B000SQJ27I|5.0|Manu Chao is a not what you think of \\"world music\\" as being. For many people, that equals weird, inaccessable music played on instruments you can't identify.<br /><br />In the case of Manu Chao, it means something far warmer and more enjoyable, full of driving catchy Eurorock rhythms, funky edges, a crazy Spanish flavour, and vaguely political sensibilities. It's been six years since his last internationally-released album, but \\"La Radiolina\\" (translation: the little radio) was an event worth waiting for.<br /><br />It kicks off with the \\"13 D&iexcl;as,\\" a racing blur of folky-rocky-guitar and lots of mumbling. But that's only the warm-up into the melodious, brass-band-edged rocker  \\"Tristeza Maleza,\\" which sounds like Spoon got invaded by Andalusian musicians, and the hypnotic guitar-rap of \\"Politik Kills (\\"Politik needs your mind/politik needs human beings/politik needs lies...\\")<br /><br />And with the driving, blurring, siren-laden \\"Rainin In Paradize,\\" the album really blossoms into all it can be -- colourful bouncy folkpop, sensual ballads, meditative little tunes, driving little rockers flavoured with odd sounds and fiery tight guitars, and a long stretch of swirling Spanish-inspired music.<br /><br />It finishes up with a wicked trio of songs -- a kinetic, high-speed electrorocker with a sly smile woven into all the buzzing, a meditative little instrumental on acoustic guitar, and finally the driving \\"Y Ahora Qu_\\" with its blazing bass and ringing riffs.<br /><br />It's a suitably energetic finale to an album that is uptempo and intense, but without being oppressive about it. Instead, Mano Chao gives his music a relaxed feel -- it's like being at a colourful nighttime party with plenty of food, drink and dancing, but in a city full of turmoil during the day.<br /><br />The main instrument here is guitar, and it's played here with extreme versatility -- depending on who's playing it, it can form driving, hard riffs, peppy pop rhythms, or a sensual cascade of gentle flamenco strings. Wound around it is a colourful array of other instruments -- blaring rows of trumpets, rattling drums, strong basslines, and waves of looping, buzzing and/or shimmering keyboard. It's pretty intense,<br /><br />I'm ashamed to admit that I don't know more than a spattering of  Spanish or French, and only a little more Spanglish. But the meaning behind many of these songs is pretty clear, with Chao taking aim with his smooth voice -- the violent face of politics, the \\"wind of Washington,\\" and the \\"paradises\\" of the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe with its fatalities, atrocities, and rain.<br /><br />Manu Chao's colourful, world-music style is one that it's hard not to warm to, and \\"La Radiolina\\" is a primo example of what he can conjure. Beautiful, creative and full of life.rful array of other instruments -- blaring rows of trumpets, rattling drums, strong basslines, and waves of looping, buzzing and/or shimmering keyboard.

B000SQJ27I|5.0|La Radiolina is a magical album.  One of those rare collections that only gets better with each listening.  Songs like Mala Fama and Me Llaman Calle wil treat fans hungry for the smoother sounds found on Clandestino but Rainin in Paradie and Politk Kills will show how up to date Manu is.  Get the album, listen to it a few times, learn a few new words and spread the spirt of Manu with those around you.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|A very fine picture, with a first rate performance by Paul Giamatti -- his best, in fact.  As Inspector Uhl, an amateur conjurer who idolizes the magician whose career he has been ordered to destroy, he nearly steals the picture, but aside from a few minor quibbles, it has been so cleverly written and directed by Neil Burger, and is full of so many good performances, that this doesn't quite happen.<br /><br />As Eisenheim, the Illusionist, Edward Norton gives a wonderful performance, but he's saddled with the only scenes in the picture that don't work:  the love scenes, which, curiously, are shot almost entirely in close-up, so that no chemistry ever develops between him and the woman who is supposedly the love of his life.  At times, one gets the impression that he and his leading lady filmed their scenes without actually being together in the same room.  As that woman, Jessica Biel is pretty & looks well in her bodices and petticoats, but her character is very nearly a cipher. As the half-mad Crown Prince Leopold, Rufus Sewell gives a broad, roaring performance in the old tradition of Hollywood villains from the Golden Age.  He's a combination of Basil Rathbone and Conrad Veidt -- and immensely entertaining every moment he's on screen.<br /><br />Filmed on location in and around Prague, \\"The Illusionist\\"  looks gorgeous:  the production design of is one of its greatest assets.<br /><br />As is his wont, Philip Glass lets his music burble away murkily without ever arriving at -- or even approaching -- a climax (orchestral blue-balls, I call it); on the other hand, the endless repetitiveness of his strings produces a nice sense of menace, ennui and claustrophobia entirely appropriate to the story it underscores.<br /><br />All in all, a thoroughly entertaining and haunting picture that stands up admirably on repeated viewings.  Highly recommended.
B000MRA5EM|4.0|This movie was fairly entertaining, but better at the IMAX.  My mother is a huge Jonny Depp fan and wanted to see this, but because of a disease she has she could not go to the IMAX.  This was a great alternative for her.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|\\"1\\" is a true treat for your ears and well worth owning - even if you have all their albums on CD. My first impression was that these remastered tracks were vastly superior to the same tracks on the CD albums - but the difference is in fact only marginal. The tracks on \\"1\\" have been carefully processed to enhance their apparent loudness.     Using my multitrack sound editor I compared the 1987 CD album version of \\"Come Together\\" to that from \\"1\\" and found that you need to reduce the \\"1\\" version volume by 55% to match the perceived volume of the 1987 version - but it's certainly not all bad news.     You can see that the dynamic range has been reduced in the remastering, but the spectrum analyser shows that the freqency range has been increased to 22kHz (the 1987 version cuts off at 20kHz). The tape hiss in the 1987 version has been totally eliminated. The most siginificant difference is that new version has noticeably more bass - but the mids and highs seem equally well defined in both versions.     \\"1\\" wets your appetite for hearing the entire Beatles catalogue in higher resolution 24-bit 96kHz DVD-Audio - and the \\"Love\\" album proves that The Beatles justify every possibility of that format.
0471267554|5.0|As a professional ski instructor, speaker, and author, I am almost constantly shocked at what people tend to eat--and the resulting catatonic state that I find so many struggling to overcome. The Paleo Diet helps to illustrate why that is. Basically, we're not eating the way that we are designed to eat, instead giving in to the very modern \\"convenience\\" of prepared and manufactured food (from wheat to sugar) and reaping the consequences.<br /><br />I have long studied the more scientific approaches to diet and learned what works well for me.

B000PMGNK4|2.0|I keep hearing that GITS is one of the best, deepest, and most thought provoking animes of all time, and everytime I hear it, I keep wondering why.       The series does have its good points, but I've seen both this movie and the \\"2nd Gig\\" and they both feel like something is missing.       Just what makes GITS so appealing anyway?  Is it good as a military series? Is it he Action? The characters? The themes and philosophical points behind it?  If that's what you're looking for, you should check out Full Metal Panic, especially The Second Raid; It will SMOKE Ghost in the Shell in all the aspects mentioned above, but most notably in the \\"characters\\" department -the characters from Full Metal Panic actually have charisma.       People keep talking about the depth and philosophical meaning behind Ghost in the Shell, but what does Solid State Society have to offer in these aspects?  Mainly, it brings up the role that the elderly play in society, as well as the problem of child abuse...Okay.  Sounds more like political and social than philosophical.  That is precisely where I think Ghost in the Shell fails: It's supposed to be a military anime, but it doesn't feel like one.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Surprising new enactment of the sacrifice of a man who had always been in contact with the other side of reality in a vast fight against Lucifer to whom the world has been totally abandoned by God. And the sacrifice is supposed to save the world. Not by redeeming the sins of human beings. But by preventing the birth of Lucifer's son and the total take-over of the world by him. The strangest element is that everything is purely haphazard. There is no plan, no real perspective known and controlled by anyone, especially not God, and least of all Lucifer. It is pure opportunism on their sides and human beings are always taken in-between these two famously inconsequent and irresponsible characters and they have to accept, follow and suffer what the other two in their big conflict don't even know they produce. Even Archangel Gabriel is totally spaced out and corrugated and Lucifer will punish him by burning his wings and making him human and sensitive to suffering. Let's hope for eternity. The special effects are from time to time agreeable and pleasant but never really outstanding. The story is messy and obscure and the spear that had been used by a Roman soldier to pierce Jesus' side on the cross and had disappeared for some time reappears by pure luck somewhere in Mexico of all places. Naïve. And we don't know at all what's the use of it and what it brings to the story. The second coming of Lucifer's son is a failure. The second coming of some Jesus, new or old, is also a failure since Lucifer has to resuscitate him for him not to go to Hell for eternity. And they repeat as often as possible that He has a plan for anyone of us. In fact He and They have nothing for none of us. We are lost in a messy haphazard conflict between a truant God and a totally disorganized Lucifer. That's what divine providence amounts to: nothing at all.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

0440418569|2.0|I just finished the entire trilogy of His Dark Materials over the past week. I absolutely loved the first two novels. I was very willing to overlook Pullman's anti-religious slant, since the first two novels had absolute control over my attention. Lyra and Will were such wonderful protagonists. The supporting characters were just phenomenal as well. However, the third book just devolved into a mess.     The first two books have you gearing up for this ultimate battle between Heaven and Everybody Else. Unfortunately, you really don't know how the battle ends other than that the heads of each side dies. Another unfortunate thing is that this huge battle doesn't seem to change anything in the end.    Lyra is supposed to be the new Eve, but all she ends up doing is making out/having sex with Will. The fact that they're so young really bothers me as well. I don't think that's a good message to be sending to childen or young adults. And this is supposed to redeem the universe how?    What about the new world order? So many of the favorites die but for what? Organized religion is still in control. Lyra and Will don't ride off into the sunset together. Everything goes back to just status quo. I think the writer was letting his atheist agenda get in the way of good storytelling. I really can't see how this book got so many recommendations and awards, especially with the surplus of such wonderful other YA books out right now.    The anti-religious stuff didn't bother me, but the lack of a worthy ending did.
B000VK7KVQ|5.0|The movie is over 2.5 hours, but there is no lag in the suspense.  If you lived during this era you will see a movie where the sets, cars, furniture, costumes are right on target.  I would rate this as one of the best movies i've ever viewed.  The \\"stars\\" are all top notch, but the movie doesn't need the stars to elevate the film.  I totally agree that this is Oscar worthy.  There is no real bloody gore.  The suspense is hard to match.  This is a movie worth the time to watch.
B00004R9A4|5.0|This has always been a favorite and my kids from grade school to college enjoy it as well.
B000V39KDO|5.0|When i rented this movie, i was reluctant.  At times it bordered on the fantasy realm.  I'm a big fan of the HBO series Rome, and i have studied the history as well.  What this movie brings to light is the sad loss of virtue, integrity, trust and doing something, a cause, that would leave you to the ultimate cost - one's life.  And to do so for something higher than one's self and for the belief in your country, family and friendship.  This movie with the deep thoughts of the war on terror we face today.  Our world has changed.  There are people out there with strong beliefs and standards who are not afraid to die for something they believe in.  Right or wrong, this is their belief.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best sci-fi series with just about everything including plot, special effects and interesting characters. The music is good as well. My kids convinced me to watch it first, and I wish it would have lasted longer. Definitely worth getting and watching multiple times.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Have you ever watched a movie with an epic battle and said to yourself, \\"wow that was great I wish it were abit longer though.\\" ? I always thought that with the battles in Return of the King and Gladiator. This movie is that question answered and then some. There are so many just pure raw sword fighting, spear slashing scene in this it's almost pornographic the violence. Do not sit down to this movie thinking you will get a history lesson about the intricacies about Spartan culture.<br /><br />300 is very stylized, very graphic, very slick in it's presentation. I almost gave it 4 stars because of it being so stylized but man this movie delivers enough action for a few years.

B000OVLBEO|4.0|The 2007 comic book-inspired film \\"Ghost Rider\\", directed & written by Mark Steven Johnson (who also directed & wrote the 2003 film \\"Daredevil\\"), is an entertaining action & fantasy film.  The story focuses on a daredevil motorcycle performer named Johnny Blaze, who, as a teenager (played by Matt Long), performs alongside his motorcycle-riding father Barton (Brett Cullen).  Discovering that his father has terminal cancer, Johnny is paid a visit from an odd stranger who turns out to be the devil (veteran actor Peter Fonda), who offers to cure Johnny's father for Johnny's soul.  Unintentionally agreeing, Johnny's father is miraculously healed, but suddenly & unexpectedly dies after Johnny decides to leave with his teenage girlfriend Roxanne (Raquel Alessi).  Johnny instead leaves by himself, taking only his father's prized chopper.  As an adult (played by Nicolas Cage), Johnny continues to perform, but by doing increasingly dangerous stunts.  He gets another opportunity to connect with Roxanne (played as an adult by Eva Mendes), but is recruited by the devil to do battle with four fearsome demons, of which one is the devil's son named Blackheart (Wes Bentley).  It is then that Johnny transforms into the powerful, burning, skeletal, anti-hero minion named \\"ghost rider\\", along with his prized chopper, which transforms into a similar burning demonic riding machine.    With dazzling special affects to bring the \\"ghost rider\\", demons & ghosts to life, the film will probably appeal to any comic book aficionado.  Thanks to the acting abilities of Nicolas Cage, Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott (who plays a cemetery caretaker), \\"Ghost Rider\\" should keep most viewers engaged even though some plot elements are somewhat predictable.  Overall, \\"Ghost Rider\\" earns a weak, but deserved 4 out of 5 stars as it is certainly better than  Mark Steven Johnson's previous film \\"Daredevil\\".

B000VNMMRA|4.0|Could have been as good as the first two except for the presence of a very bland villain, easily surpassed by his beautiful and mean sidekick (Maggie Q). Two months after seeing this film I don't even remmember how the guy met his end.  The action scenes are as good as any in the first 3 films but unlike #1 & #2 the action is not limited to one specific place which somehow dilutes the excitment.  All in all, a superior action movie.

0440238609|1.0|I picked these books up at a used book sale.  The first half of the first book didn't even make sense with all the new terms mixed in a parallel universe.  The second book was better at explaining things, but had some questionable material.  The third book was downright sacriligious.  The \\"good\\" guys are out to challenge the \\"Authority\\" who is just a really really old angel, and to replace society and religion.  The church is seen as nothing but a mindless enemy.  I destroyed my copies, and I hope with this review, some parents will think twice about allowing their children to be exposed to such filth.  It's amazing that this offensive stuff even gets printed.
0446310786|5.0|I read this book several years ago and lost my copy along the way.  My book club selected it for the Oct. meeting so I ordered it from Amazon.  Haven't had time to read it again but look forward to doing so
B000RIHBIE|4.0|Saw Sum 41 on Leno or SNL (can't remember which) and I loved them. All Killer No Filler has always been one of those albums that I can't say no to listening to. I haven't listened to anything from Sum 41 since and this album seems a little different from All Killer No Filler. The first few songs seem the same, but I can't say for sure if any of their other CDs are similar. I guess I'm just a casual listener.
B000A5044C|5.0|Thi film is slow and requires patience but it is beautifully and delicately directed, written and acted. A childish rather irritating woman selfishly abandons her kids to fend for themselves. The oldest is a 12 year old boy who then takes on responsibilities well beyond his years to help his siblings  to survive and stay together. The actor portraying this boy gives a very nuanced performance. The film is in the style of  almost like a documentary or reality show. It is not your normal Hollywood film and will be more appreciated by the discerning film watcher rather than someone wanting to watch something mainstream and escapist. The film also does not present any easy solutions to the problem nor does it try to.

006085880X|5.0|This was the first Jodi Picoult book I've ever read...and it definitely did NOT disappoint! The bond between Chris Harte and Emily Gold is fascinating, albeit a little creepy.  However, Picoult does an excellent job of portraying the nature of this bond to the reader...and that is very important when it comes to understanding the actions of Chris and Emily. The book also provides helpful insight on the difficult subject of teen suicide.  At first, when reading the back cover of the book, I thought it might be a bit too depressing...but overall, it was simply a fascinating page-turner that kept me wondering what REALLY happened to Emily the night she died.  I highly recommend \\"The Pact,\\" and after just finishing my second Picoult novel (\\"My Sister's Keeper\\"), I am HOOKED! I plan to read all of her novels.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|i give it lots of credit because it's not very often they come out with something like this. it wasn't scary, but it was a thrill and suspenseful as well. the mother and daughter both seemed lost. they have to move on, hopefully to better things, but it's not so. the mother is haunted by her own past, as well as a haunting in her present. she thinks she's losing it, but she feels there's something more. her daughters in the middle, then in the end she pays the ultimate sacrifice for her little girl. now she must become what she onced feared. good plot and nice twist. although personally i wish it would have ended differently. jennifer connelly did a very good job, playing this woman, who thought she had control of her life, but not so.
1591396190|4.0|You should read this book if only to be reminded that putting your prices down is never a good idea!  My company has been struggling for decent growth in a mature market because all our competitors keep offering 20% and 30% discounts to gain new business and yet there isn't the 60-70% growth in the market to be had to make up for that loss of margin.  We have tried to stay out of this kind of \\"red ocean\\" fight and as a result, though our market share is not as great, our profits are higher!  It was good to read a book that reaffirms our values as a company and re-encourges us to stick to this strategy.  I am doubtful however whether or not making the competition irrelevant can actually be achieved.
B00003CXFG|4.0|man this movie was hard core, since the first time i watched it, and even now after many many times of seeing it. it's still a good one for me. man especially since vin diesel was up in there. my hero. movie does him justice. he's great, his acting, and his skills. let the world know who he was. he's been unstoppable since. another one of my favorites is cole hauser. i give him props. this was a thrill ride. you never know what's in the dark. there's always a scare of the unknown. don't venture in the dark alone. \\"i'm not the one you gotta worry about\\", nicely spoken. riddicks not the bad guy here, he's going to turn out to be the hero, the leader, their hope. good movie, if you haven't seen it you definitly should.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|need i say more. if you've seen this movie you know what i mean, if you haven't that says it all. that's what happens in those crazy countries, where they got all this underground stuff going on. if you're a tourist you better watch out. it's there house, and you're just a visitor. overall this movie was good. three unsuspecting guys who think they're in for some fun...turns out to be their worst nightmare. there's no escape, and no bodies on your side. there's torture, blood, and gory stuff. makes you kind of flinch and glad it isn't you. i think they managed to do what they set out to do which was make you feel disgusted, and glad you're home. nice job, and jay was pretty good too. i do recommend if this kind of stuff is you're thing.
0060763280|5.0|This book is phenomenal...I had just finished it and I am about to read it again to apply the activities and exercises given throughout the book.

I suggest this book to anyone who wants and desires to change their financial blueprint!

It has charming Eric Carle illustrations and covers a variety of North American animals such as skunks, deer, and prairie dogs.  The amount of text is perfect to engage the interest of young children, while the North American animals capture the attention of older children.  Highly recommended.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|To their credit, the producers of Planet Earth give viewers the opportunity to get a glimpse of the stunning beauty of (what is left of) the natural world that is inaccessible to most humans.  Planet Earth producers explore the different natural habitats such as the seas, caves, great plains, and forests in the first four discs.  Thanks to the BBC, the producers have been able to mobilize top-notch talent and state-of-the-art equipment to accomplish this tour de force.<br /><br />Like other media productions made about the natural world over the last 30 years, Planet Earth helps raise awareness about nature's beauty and diversity as well as the human footprint on nature.  One of the greatest merits of the series is to market the huge economic value of the environmental services that nature renders scot-free to humanity, e.g., pollinating, cleaning water, cleansing the atmosphere, and restoring soil.<br /><br />But there is a downside to Planet Earth's accomplishment.  Jonathon Porritt, Chair, U.K. Sustainable Development Commission, rightly states in disc five that natural history programming has turned most viewers into passive voyeurs of nature rather than engaged co-habitants with nature.  That type of programming can give people the false impression that because nature is captured on film, it is all okay out there.<br /><br />To their chagrin, Planet Earth producers knew that what they were capturing on film was often disappearing under their eyes. Russell Mittermeier, President, Conservation International, reminds his audience that Antarctica aside, only a quarter of the Earth's land surface is still wilderness.  For example, James Leape, Director General, WWF International, point outs that about half of the world's forests have already been lost.  Another example is that more and more species such as the Amur leopard, Walia Ibex, Saiga antelope, and Bactrian camels are on the edge of extinction because of their human predators.<br /><br />However, not everything has yet been lost.  As Jeffrey McNeely, Chief Scientist, World Conservation Union, observes, about 12% of the land cover is protected area.  To compound the challenge of environmental protection, M.A. Sanjayan, Lead Scientist, The Nature Conservancy, adds that 80% of the world's biodiversity does not exist in national parks.<br /><br />To their credit, the producers of Planet Earth raise one controversial issue after another about nature conservation in disc five which is by far the most important of all five discs.  Here follow a few examples for illustration purposes only:<br /><br />1) Narrator Simon Poland provocatively asks the question:  Is conservation only a wealthy Western concern, a luxury, a fantasy?  Mittermeier acknowledges that wilderness protection, which was born in the West, has not necessarily spread worldwide.  As Doctor Craig Packer, Ecologist, bluntly puts it, people who have high environmental ethics will have to put their money where their mouth is.  Packer correctly points out that they will have a hard time convincing local people who have to feed themselves and their family that they can eat ethics.  In Costa Rica, there are companies that are charging their customers an extra fee for the water bill they pay in order to compensate the farmers for the 300,000 hectares that they convert back to forest beyond the 500,000 hectares of national parks.  Forests are water factories.<br /><br />2) Poland also asks the non-PC question: Is population the greatest threat to wilderness?  It is no coincidence that the natural world shrinks as human population grows.  Ignoring population strikes Porritt as the biggest own goal that the environment movement has ever scored.  There are currently over six billion people on this planet; the number is expected to grow to nine billion by the middle of this century.  These people need to be fed.  In order to feed those people, humans need to convert some nature to agriculture, preferably where they destroy the least biodiversity as Jan Kees, Director of Sustainable Agriculture, Unilever, observes with much wisdom.  Porritt correctly notes that good family planning is all about empowering women and girls with literacy and better healthcare to bring birth rates down.  Porritt controversially adds to his comment that the world's main religions have been pathetically disengaged in the area of nature preservation.  World's main religions have to figure out how to reconcile the primacy of life with the preservation of (God's) creation.<br /><br />3) Poland raises another heretical issue: How to reconcile a conservation vision with a world based on Western lifestyles?  Doctor Robert Watson, Chief Scientist World Bank, thinks that the bigger threat to the environment is not population increase, but the growth in human economy and the way humanity uses its wealth.  Peyton Knight, National Center for Public Policy Research, argues that sustainable development is environmentalists' very clever term to mean no development.  Sanjayan acknowledges that Western environmentalists cannot go to developing countries and tell them that they cannot get what rich countries already have in terms of development.  These are real human aspirations for Western lifestyles that cannot be stopped, but at best redirected in a less destructive way.<br /><br />Perhaps, the only major critique that could be leveled against Planet Earth is the dearth of emphasis on individual accountability.  Corporations, in which many viewers own shares, have as primary mission to turn a profit and pay shareholders for the risks taken.  Companies cannot be expected to bear alone the brunt of the costs of fixing environmental ills.  Too often, there is a gap between what consumers say about their willingness to pay more for greener products and services and how they really behave in the marketplace.<br /><br />To summarize, Planet Earth gives viewers a holistic view of nature conservation that figures among the best out there.of Sustainable Agriculture, Unilever, observes with much wisdom.

1582406723|5.0|This is the first volume in the Walking Dead series.  Its centers around Rick Grimes, a former officer of the law, who wakes from a coma to see the world flooded with zombies.  This first volume chronicles his journey to find his wife and kid and his getting to know fellow survivors.      The book seems familiar but manages to keep from clises and stay fresh.  Every character is deep and multi demensional and there is no one you can just flat out hate.      If you are a fan of sophisticated horror comics then this is the best there is.  Excellent story with absolutely beautiful black and white art (which I think works even better than if it was in color).      Just buy it and you will not be dissapointed.      *****
B000MXPE7O|5.0|I saw more in this movie than a story about the CIA.  I saw an exaggerated tale of what many men close to power, whether in the business or political worlds, go through to achieve their business ends.  Yes, family and a semblance of humanity are not always sacrificed, but there are those -- call them workaholics, drudges, whatever -- to whom work and order are more important than family and friends.  These men enter a cerebral world where they have to live by something not taught at Yale -- their wits -- to survive.      These men (and some women) are all around us.  There are decisions made thousands of times a day to put business or political objectives before family and friends, though not always with the dramatic alienation that this movie depicts.  But every such decision, compounds over time to produce alienation from loved ones.  This movie offers a tale of how a bright and apparently sensitive young man can be molded into a husk of himself by devotion to \\"pleasing his superiors\\" and success at all costs, rooted in a 'love of country'.      Matt Damon gives a particularly fine performance.    On a lesser scale of importance, the movie provides a much-needed public airing of the connections between the Bonesmen and the CIA.
0451197968|4.0|I finished this book just today. It was my first Stephen King book that he wrote under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, and I must say, it was very good. The movie is garbage that should be avoided. The plot of the novel was very well done and the detail had style. The ending was great. The reason I give it four stars instead of five is because of a couple disturbing moments in the last 4-5 pages before the ending. Other than that, it was good, and I recommend it to all Stephen King fans.    P.S. Until Blaze came out, this was the only one of the Bachman books that was worth reading. I am going to read Blaze and will review it when I get a chance.
B000002IMG|2.0|Relative late-comers to the Thrash Metal elite, Testament dropped a vicious, thundering classic of a debut before gradually spiralling into a vortex of mediocrity over their next few records.  Objectively, 'The New Order' is a pretty decent follow-up.  The production is clearer and crunchier and the song-writing and performances are almost as strong.  Nevertheless, this record has none of the intensity and youthful enthusiasm that makes 'The Legacy' special.    'Disciples of the Watch' is the only truly classic moment here - a Thrash masterpiece and one of the band's finest ever moments.  Most of the rest of the album sounds self-conscious and contrived, the only time the band sound like they're having any fun is on the decent Aerosmith cover.  If you judge this type of music on riffs and solos then it is probably worth purchasing, look elsewhere if you crave urgency and spark.  Either way, get 'The Legacy' first.
B000OVLBEO|1.0|I'm an old harley rider and i remember me and other bikers fell asleep while this movie was running,,,,i don't see any connection between this movie and Harley davidson, i felt like i was a little kid there, the story wasn't made that well,,,i think the senario was poor and need a lot of experiance to represent it to people, i won't lie that we were waiting for this movie, i rather have seen a bike been made by indian larry instead of this dream bike. I wish that Cage respected his fans specialy the Harley bikers to provide theme with something that will show there good side of being bikers. To me Wild Hogs was more real than this, at least it shows some of real Harley life on the road. We hope that we can see something better later from Cage. God bless you all and have a great day
B00005JODK|5.0|Having not watched either the 1988 original or the Broadway version of Hairspray, I am enthralled by the 2007 update. The casting was excellent.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer is the evil station manager Velma Von Tussle whose only intention is to keep her teenage daughter in the limelight as the ultimate Miss Teenage Hairspray. Her foxy sultriness and impeccable aura makes her role shine. John Travolta in his fat suit and much hyped about gender-bending role as Edna Turnblad is anything but hilarious. While he tries to mimic the voice of a middle-aged obese woman who is disconnected from society, it's really his (or her) antics that lights up the screen. Christopher Walken as Wilbur Turnblad is incredibly affectionate yet deadpan at times though he delivers that fatherly and husband instincts with great aplomb. Queen Latifah as the over-the-top Motormouth Maybelle fights to keep her black cast on the show with excellent rendition of songs especially the tearjerker I Know Where I've Been.<br /><br />In the end, the two unbelievable stars of Hairspray must be newcomer Nikki Blonsky and High School Musical Zac Efron who play Tracy Wilbur and Link Larkin respectively. Blonsky plays the fervent show chaser who aspires to be part of the cast with great fervor and becomes an accidental anti-racism activist while Efron shakes off his childish shadow by playing a charming TV character. The unlikely romance between Tracy and Link unfolds with much realism onscreen as their chemistry is unmistakable.<br /><br />In Hairspray, the acting is great and the music is good. The New Girl in Town\\", \\"Big, Blonde and Beautiful\\" (Reprise), and \\"Come So Far (Got So Far to Go)\\" are the three songs new to this version of Hairspray.<br /><br />The musical is highly entertaining and celebratory despite some minor flaws. (A)

B00003CY5J|4.0|The score is about stealing a scepter. Robert DeNiro, Ed Norton, and Marlon Brando scheme and plan to steal a King's scepter in the Montreal Custom House. Norton has a janitorial job there to help them get inside. Between wondering how to make the job work and wondering who they can trust there is a fair amount of suspense. Fans of movies like \\"The Italian Job\\" and \\"Foolproof\\" should enjoy it. Very good acting in this movie and you will appreciate Norton's ability especially as once again he shows another personality as he did in \\"Primal Fear\\". DeNiro and Brando are excellent as always. I highly recommend this crime caper movie.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I have watched several of the Classic Album DVD's, including Steely Dan/Aja (which is excellent, and probably my favorite band/album), The Who/Who's Next (which is OK), and Cream/Disraeli Gears (which even though I'm a big fan, was not that great). Anyway, this one, Pink Floyd/Dark Side of the Moon is by far the best. It just grabbed me and had me mesmerized from start to finish. The scenes with David Gilmour playing solo electric and pedal steel versions of Breathe, and Us and Them are so amazing, I can't even find the right words to describe it. Gilmour is hands down the best guitar player in the classic rock genre. I was also impressed with the solo piano playing of Rick Wright as he talked about coming up with some of the chord changes and turnarounds in Breathe and Us and Them. But, I think what really blew me away the most was the thoughtful and interesting perspective that Roger Waters puts on the whole project throughout the documentary. Watching this DVD has convinced me that it is definitely no accident that this album spent something like 741 consecutive weeks on the Billboard charts. Just remember, \\"there is no dark side of the moon, really, matter of fact it's all dark....\\" Grab this one, you won't be disappointed.
B0000067L2|5.0|DISRAELI GEARS is a great Cream CD, especially in its remastered form. Classics such as \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\", \\"Strange Brew\\", \\"SWLABR\\", and \\"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\\" helped to create the style known as heavy metal, but lesser-known cuts that include \\"Dance The Night Away\\" and \\"We're Going Wrong\\" are equally impressive and should not be discounted. This CD is a necessity in any complete rock & roll fan's musical library.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Sauntering over to the Music Box in Chicago to see a Robert Altman film one Saturday morning, traffic delayed me so much that I got there well into the Altman film, but in time to see \\"Black Book\\" which I really hadn't planned to see having been burned out on Holocaust films. But am I glad I did see it. It is unlike any Holocaust film I'd ever seen before. I loved it so much that I dragged my wife to see it the next Friday night -- and she loved it too!    I hadn't planned on ever seeing this amazing film, but it blew me away. I am going to try very hard to avoid revealing any spoilers because one of the great things about this adventurous, fast-moving tale of survival is all the twists and turns it takes. Our heroine can never really be sure who is one which side. Some good guys turn out to be bad guys; some bad guys turn out to be good guys; and some just stay the same. This is the sort of film that doesn't waste a scene. Pay attention ... because things that are said early on may come back later in the film.    Beyond that, I don't want to reveal anything else. While I still think this is the best film I've seen all year (it's now early Sept 2007), I realize it may not be everybody's cup of tea. But if you like a film that totally engages you, goes places you don't expect it to go, never has a dull moment, is incredibly well-acted especially by Carice van Houten, very well directed, and offers great inspiration and insight into the lengths ordinary people will go to survive against all odds (that's not a spoiler because not everybody survives against all odds in this film), then \\"Black Book\\" is for you.

Also, the quality of color could be better. It wasn't until after we watched the entire movie that we discovered it was pre-set with subtitles in Korean. The second time I watched it alone, I had to reset the monitor to \\"English with no subtitles.\\" There should have been an accompanying note of explanation.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|Boring, senseless, bad paced, predictable. Can't find a positive aspect for this movie, not even the photography or soundtrack was worth the admission fee. One star alone for the cast, yet acting is nothing memorable either.
0679746323|5.0|The authors chronicle the devious and bloody course of Mao's rise and reign. Are the historical facts skewed? In general, it seems they are well supported. While they compile and document their facts, many new, with care, the authors' voices can be heard imploring the reader to see the reality of the man that dominated China and influenced world affairs for so many decades. Spending 600 pages with the authors, one realizes several things: they are right - that this individual first manipulated people and then ruled by terror, killing, depriving, and turning his political allies against each other. Communism in this story is not a concept of shared wealth but rather an individual's pretense for skewering his contemporaries, instilling unshakable fear in a population to subjugate them, and ultimately as a means to open a pipeline of resources from Stalin and other World leaders. The pretense of achieving the common good repeatedly achieved a common hell for the people but often achieved Mao's goals for Mao. Barbaric actions were committed in the name of the people, against the people, largely to make them obey absolutely.<br /><br />I often wished that the authors' invective and revulsion toward Mao were absent from the prose. Additionally, the authors stretch a bit at each turn to be sure to villainize Mao, sometimes in frivolous matters, so much so that the reader is left wondering if the authors may have overreached and may have asserted some unsubstanciated conclusions. But, in the balance, the evidence is overwhelmingly there - the vision of unity he sought for China was anything but a benevolent one and the methods he employed were heinous.<br /><br />Even while the authors harp on Mao, I also must admit, having their sanguine (albeit repetious) human insights voiced during the rough ride eased the horror of the journey they lead. This book could well be revised in years to come so as to just leave the proven cold facts. The fuel for the fire of outrage is present in the facts alone.<br /><br />The narrative held something else new for me: a fresh perspective of global politics as they are in fact played out. It portrays men, with Mao or Stalin the masters, and Khrushchev, Kennedy, and Nixon the other actors, playing chess. The chessman are their people: one chessman may be an entire army of soldiers, or tens of thousands of townspeople, or one of their country's resources: grain, minerals, technical knowhow. Or a pawn may be the civilians in one area, or even local civil sanity, or somethings as actually chess-like as the fear of a potential rival or a ruler's son held hostage.<br /><br />In the game, the Queen is national or world opinion and the King is the main player: the man who wins the game and the country or the world arena. This saga gives much insight as to what a shrewd world leader can be seen willing to do with his might.<br /><br />BTW - the \\"Was this helpful\\" votes for this book's reviews are clearly bogus -  a ploy termed  \\"click fraud.\\"<br />(If you look at the wild votes ratios for different reviews and review quality, this will be immediately apparent. E.g., where are to be found the intellegent bad critical reviews of the book to support the vote statistics?) This vote fraud is an interesting, hopefully distant echo of the political methods portrayed in this book.<br /><br />(Note added years later - the click-fraud has fortunately been removed - no longer are there present for the many good reviews of this book, the strange tallies for \\"Was this helpful?\\"  like No = 150 Yes= 21.)

Fortunately we have 2 TV sets, so she can watch something else.  I have a short list of 18 movies I never get tired of seeing.  Shane is the only western on my list, though I've seen all the other obvious contenders for best western.  But this one grabs me and never lets go.

032147404X|2.0|This little book looks pretty from the outside, and has some good colour photographs but the author's irritating \\"humour\\" grates on MY nerves, anyway - maybe you won't mind.  He has a number of hobby horses that he rides to death - for example, he mentions the necessity of using a tripod in almost every second sentence.  Fine, good advice in most cases, but pleeease, let's move along!!!    He also tends to reduce everything to a \\"recipe\\" - lists of things to take photographs of at a wedding; a precise description of how to photograph a flower (a - against a white background, b - against a black background.) Perhaps if you want to take some technically good photographs with a decent camera and you have very little creativity of your own, this might be helpful.

B00003CXCW|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />\\"The body of a young man was found floating in the pool of her mansion [on Sunset Blvd.]...The poor dope.  He always wanted a pool.\\"<br /><br />This is how this bizarre movie begins, a movie that contains elements of drama, horror, and black comedy.  The title is named after the famous boulevard that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills.  Also, the full title of this movie is \\"Sunset Boulevard: A Hollywood Story.\\"<br /><br />The movie is about a down-on-his-luck screenwriter named Joe Gillis (William Holden, 1918 to 1981) who narrates the story (the above quotation is by Gillis) and his accidental encounter with a fading silent screen movie star and femme fatale named Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson, 1899 to 1983).  She involves the unsuspecting Gillis in her fantasy world of making a comeback to the movie screen.  Norma has a somewhat strange butler named Max (Erich Von Stroheim, 1885 to 1957) who tries to protect her from sinking to far into a depression with regard to her fading career.<br /><br />There are also famous people in the past that have bit parts in this movie.  I identified the director Cecil B. DeMille (who plays himself), Jack Webb (of \\"Dragnet\\" fame), and Buster Keaton (silent screen comedian who has a cameo).<br /><br />The entire movie has witty, well-written dialogue.  Besides the quotation above by Gillis, here are two more of my favorite quotations:<br /><br />(1) Gillis: \\"You used to be in silent pictures.  You used to be big.\\"  Norma:  \\"I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.\\"<br /><br />(2) This is the last line of this movie given by Norma: \\"All right Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\\"<br /><br />The acting is superb!  Gloria Swanson gives an unforgettable performance as Norma Desmond (that somewhat parallels Swanson's own life since she at one time was a top silent screen actress).  I also enjoyed the performance of Erich Von Stroheim who plays Norma's butler.<br /><br />The background music heightens the tension of each scene.  I was also impressed with the photography throughout this entire movie.<br /><br />This movie was nominated for 11 Academy Awards.  It won 3.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the special collector's edition released in 2002) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has some interesting extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an unforgettable movie.  See for yourself why it was rated #16 on the 2007 American Film Institute's list of the 100 best American films!!<br /><br />(1950;  1 hr, 50 min;  black and white;  full screen;  19 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko or \\"Uncle Stevie,\\" London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXension of each scene.

The theme has been brought back closer to the Tom Baker/Peter Davidson era which is a good thing. But be warned there are two songs which are just bad. They are sung in a very \\"middle of the road.\\" Mr. Gold does some great scores but these songs are something that K9 would have to destory to save the day. Overall, very good soundtrack.

I laughed (yes) and cried(a lot) but couldn't put it down.  There are errors in all books, none in this book  take away from the bravery and love SF troops have for each other. I've read several books on SF training and soldiers and feel this is one of the best. I bet Danny,Axe, and Mickey look down on Marcus and say \\"good job,bro\\". There are 270+ reviews of this book. Keep reading America !! Try to understand what our troops are going through. Write your representatives for Lt. Michael Murphy,he deserves the Medal of Honor.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|By now, most people know the story about Kelly Clarkson defying her producers and fighting for what she believed was the artistic integrity of this album.  Based on the results, she was right to do so.  \\"My December\\" is creative and passionate, offers a refreshing digression from pop to rock, and allows Clarkson's talents - singing and writing - to shine brilliantly.  Some notes about the tracks:    (1) Never Again: This type of end-to-a-relationship, you'll-get-yours-anthem has been heard before, but Clarkson's voice and the power of her lyrics give the theme new-found flair.  Hard not to turn this one up and sing out loud.  Love it.  (2) One Minute: Unique melody on this one.  I didn't particularly care for it at first, but once I really listened to the lyrics, it grew on me.  (3) Hole: I had a brief flashback of Pat Benatar when I heard this song.  Strong lyrics, rocking melody.  (4) Sober: My favorite song on the album, highlighted by a subtle melody that lets Clarkson's voice take over and lyrics that indicate the power of self-reflection, \\"Three months and I'm still sober/picked all my weeds but kept the flower.\\"  (5) Don't Waste Your Time: Has a catchy melody - but in a good way - enjoyable listening, decent lyrics.  (6) Haunted: An aptly named song in the tradition of Evanescence.  The lyrics are powerful and clearly directed at the specter of a past love: \\"Where are you/I need you/don't leave me here on my own/Speak to me/be near me/I can't survive unless I know you're with me.\\"  (7) Be Still: A beautiful, tragic love song: \\"Before we lost hope/when we still touched/and love wasn't so hard.\\"  Showcases a new dimension of Clarkson's voice.  (8) Maybe: My second-favorite song, a mid-tempo tune with powerful lyrics: \\"I don't want to be tough/And I don't want to be proud/I don't need to be fixed and I certainly don't need to be found.\\"  (9) How I Feel: Probably the \\"poppiest\\" song on the album, follows more in the tradition of songs from \\"Breakaway.\\"  It's good, just not as unique as some of the others.  (10) Yeah: Hard to describe this one.  It's Macy Gray-ish, sultry.  (11) Can I Have a Kiss: Has a pop sound, with some introspective lyrics asking for forgiveness: \\"I know why you left/I can't blame you myself.\\"  (12) Irvine: A beautiful, bluesy song about the bitterness of lost love.  The transition to \\"Chivas\\" makes the total track unique and stunning.
B000RJO578|5.0|\\"Hot Fuzz\\" is one of the funniest movies I've seen for a while.  Although it's British, you need not be a fan of British humor to love it; indeed, most of its comedy derives from making fun of quintessentially American cop movies - particularly, the fun but reality-challenged \\"Point Break\\" and \\"Bad Boyz II\\".  From the first minute, the script is packed full of comic gold.  There is no shortage of laughter from this movie!  In many ways, it's as if \\"Evil Dead II,\\" \\"Dead Alive,\\" \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" and every American cop movie were combined into some perfect mutant stepchild.<br /><br />In addition, \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is the most tightly-written and directed movie I've seen in years.  Literally every frame and every line in the first and second acts sets up, and is important to, the third act.  Not a single line could be cut without affecting the final act - something you can't say about virtually any other movie, unfortunately.  The movie is even better, and even funnier, for being written and directed with such economy.  And Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have never been funnier.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" you will love \\"Hot Fuzz.\\"  If you never saw \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" then trust me, you will still love \\"Hot Fuzz.\\"  Rent it, borrow it, buy it; but watch it somewhere, somehow.  You will be glad you did.

B000QQH4YS|5.0|I've owned the Criterion edition of \\"Robocop\\" for years now so I bought this 20th anniversary DVD strictly for the featurettes. The Commentary with Director Paul Verhoeven, Writer Ed Neumeier and Executive Producer Jon Davison (A+) is still great and worth the price of admission right there. I would rank the best featurettes in this order (No spoilers): Villains Of Old Detroit Featurette(A+)  ,  Special Effects: Then And Now Featurette(A), Robocop: Creating A Legend Featurette(A), (all three recent productions) Flesh And Steel: The Making Of Robocop Featurette(A), Shooting Robocop Featurette(B) & Making Robocop Featurette(B) (Older productions).<br />Since we've all seen the movie, I would recommend that if this movie is in your top ten all time, buy this 20th anniversary edition, those first three featurettes plus the commentary are worth the purchase price alone. I was disappointed by the deleted scenes. I had read about their content but they ended up adding nothing to the experience but no matter, still nice to see them.<br />If you are debating on purchasing the Robo-trilogy instead to save money, don't even considering buying the 20th anniversary edition. IMHO, the 20th anniversary edition is strictly for the Robo-connoisseurs, those who truly love and \\"get\\" the movie with all it's extreme violence, innuendoes and political satire. \\"I'd buy that for a dollar!\\"<br />The movie is the movie, we've all seen it. It's Verhoeven best work. The violence and intensity pull you in and pound you senselessly. The humanity and humor make it roller coaster ride with an ending that is as satisfying as it is unexpected. Easily one of the best Sci-Fi or action movies of all time.<br />Two versions here, the theatrical version and I believe the director's original \\"X-rated\\" version. I have to defer to others as to the exact cut of this version vs. what appears on the Criterion disk, no frame by frame analysis here.<br />Peter Weller does appear in some of the featurettes as well.  If you are wondering what he's been up to outside of the entertainment industry, Weller holds a Masters Degree in Roman and Renaissance Art, and is an occasional lecturer at Syracuse University on the subject of Hollywood and the Roman Empire. Wow, how cool is that? \\"Good business is where you find it.\\" Go Robo!ering what he's been up to outside of the entertainment industry, Weller holds a Masters Degree in Roman and Renaissance Art, and is an occasional lecturer at Syracuse University on the subject of Hollywood and the Roman Empire.

B00005JPLW|4.0|This is a pretty cool movie. Definitely fun (if not repetitive) to watch. To the detractors of this film who claim, \\"it's sooo unrealistic\\" I have this to say: you're all absolutely retarded. This wasn't supposed to be a documentary. The story is true but this movie is based on a COMIC BOOK DEPICTION of the story. I know it's actually called a graphic novel but I want to keep it simple for the sake of the morons demanding historical accuracy here. Anyway, as I mentioned already, this movie can get repetitive  in a hurry but if you really love over-the-top action, CGI gore and/or guys who definitely spent a few years in the gym, I recommend you rent this, kick back and watch the pretty pictures.    Here's what the director has to say about his movie by the way, \\"The events are 90 percent accurate. It's just in the visualization that it's crazy...\\"
0141000198|5.0|Most novels with a female central character do not portray her as much less than ideal.  Such is not the case here.  Bridget Jones is a little beyond the usual marriage age, and she feels it because people keep reminding her that her clock is ticking.  She is literate but not always competent.  Her love life is a mess.  She worries about her weight, her smoking, her drinking, and just about everything else.  In fact, she keeps a meticulous record of her failures.    Often she is funny, seeing the foolishness of it all.  And sometimes she is in despair and insecure.  She is always a social and physical klutz.  And these flaws in her make her come alive.  It is almost, at times, as if we are reading an actual young woman's diary.    The story moves slowly, sinuously, as Bridget tries to cope.  Her parents' marriage is falling apart.  Her friends are as mixed up as Bridget is.  Her work at the publishing company is complicated by the fact that she is in love with the man in charge, and he seems to be a user of women.  But slowly Bridget comes to realize....  Well, read the book.    There are several ties between this book and Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\"  In fact, \\"Diary\\" is, in effect the Austen book, with the heroine being a present-day English young woman, rather than one from the Regency period.  Some of the other ties include Mr. Darcy, parallel figures in both novels; actual references to the actors who played in the BBC series on the Austen book--among others.    This was made into a fine movie, one that did justice to the novel, without following it exactly.  Renee Zellweger (of Texas) would seem an unlikely actress to play a born and bred Londoner, but she is perfect in the role.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|In this movie, which runs backwards, Guy Pearce stars as Leonard (a man suffering with short term memory loss). Leonard is in search of his wife's killer, but because of his memory loss, Leonard has to rely completely on his notes (which he tatoos on his body).<br /><br />This movie has everything: interesting characters, great thought provoking plot, and emotional background music ambiance. The best part is that the ending isn't clear cut. Everytime I watch this movie I noticed something new and draw a new conclusion as to what is really going on. This movie leaves me with many questions, but they can all be answered by watching the movie again. However, once one question is answered, others spring up, and that is the true beauty of this film.<br /><br />I also reccomend Nolan's other film Insomnia. Guy Pearce has also done a few interesting films (Ravenous and The Count of Monte Cristo). both are fantastic

B000VBJEEG|5.0|I saw this a couple of months ago in the States and was blown away.  I had wanted to see this ever since publicity started up for it on shows like ET or The Insider.  I wasn't disappointed.  It was everything I thought it would be and more.  Side splitting in parts and brilliant 'animation'.  Now that it has FINALLY got to Australia (months and months later) I am heading off to see it again because it's so good.  The story line keeps you engaged the whole time even though the thought of rats in a kitchen may not seem appealing or appetising.  It's set in Paris and the scenery is very realistic and beautiful.  Remy is well voiced by Payton Oswalt (King of Queens and Reno 911) and I thought Django was done brilliantly by Brian Dennehy.  Remy comes to Paris from the French countryside to find his cooking idol is dead.  He makes friends with a restaurants garbage boy and so the fun begins.  Overall this is such a cute, adorable and cleverly written movie that will have you laughing your head off and keep you very well entertained.  I really love this and can't wait to see it again and get it on dvd.

B00005JM8V|5.0|I don't care for sad stories, or bad endings, or documentaries where children are being killed or hurt.  However, I forced myself to watch this as I think it's an important testimony to Human history.  In the span of 13 years, and not too terribly long ago, such an evil existed, that it's difficult for many people to comprehend, let alone accept.      The survivors of the Holocaust open up, without any grotesque visuals, about their experiences.  The way they discuss what they went through chills you to the bone, and makes you pain to understand what the human race is capable of.  However, it is important to understand this or it will happen again.      I cannot tell you how difficult this is to watch, but it's impact is extremely powerful.  We, the human collective, need to take responsibility for the senseless crimes and evils we do.  Shoah sends that message, ever so subliminally, but it's profoundly there.  Shoah also shows that Anti-Semitism is still very alive today today.  There are also many other racial hatreds that are causing deaths around the world -at this minute.  If the human race is to survive, we must extinguish this hatred.  Shoah shows us how powerful and deadly that hatred can be.

B00005ASIL|5.0|Frequently Asked Question #1: Why does Tull have so many different compilations?<br />Answer: Because they were compiled at different times over a 30 year period, and for different reasons.<br /><br />FAQ #2: Which one is the very best for the casual listener?<br />Answer: The Very Best of Jethro Tull.<br /><br />Here's why. The first three compilations were made in the Analog Era (Living in the Past, M.U., and Repeat) and hardly shared any songs between them. This was followed by a compilation of remastered hits at the beginning of the Digital Era (Original Masters) which had mostly songs from the previous three but had that [ADD] indicator that was so important at the time. On the 25th and 30th anniversaries they released \\"non-hit\\" compilations, or concept compilations (Acoustic and Through the Years), if you will, that are really good, but are not \\"hits collections\\".<br /><br />This album, The Very Best, can be considered the final word on hits compilations. It supercedes Original Masters. Since Original masters, Ian Anderson went back into the mixing booth and remastered every one of the analog albums. The Very Best takes the remastered versions from the albums that Ian Anderson remastered. If you want the hits in their finest digital form, as re-envisioned by the kingpin of the band himself, do not look any further. This is it.<br /><br />That said, it appears that Mr. Anderson is remaking the original compilations using the remastered recordings. The first is a remastered M.U. called Essential Jethro Tull. I imagine there will be a remastered Repeat called Essential Jethro Tull II in a year or two. What else is coming? What will they do for the 40 year retrospective? Maybe a compilation of songs about cats? That would be fun, but, if you don't want to buy 21 albums and create your own playlists, then go for this one, The Very Best of Jethro Tull.<br /><br />Clue: Buy it here instead of iTunes! It costs a dollar less, you get the CD and all that, and it's 20 songs!

I'm sure this has happened before, but let me explain why I like this stupid movie/DVD as much as I did; ** = mild spoiler.<br /><br />What makes it stupid?<br />-suspend disbelief very hard.  Psychic phenomenon is pretty well documented, but never in such an extreme or systematic way as far as I know.  I really had no problem with this aspect of the film.<br />-**A mortician who just happens to know way too much.  This guy appears in one scene out of the blue.  He basically is good friends with death and so, knows how everything works.  Oh, and he's a real nut job to boot.  This was the single most stupid and overly convenient caveat in the film.<br />-**Death as a shadowy entity was really not necessary.  This aspect kind of dumbed things down a little too much.  I expect some dumb stuff in horror films.  This was overt and lame.<br />-Some of these kids hate each other and we never know why.  This is probably my single biggest beef about the acting/script/story.  The whole rivalry thing was forced and over-blown (and otherwise unnecessary).<br />-The authorities, as usual, are idiots; Very clich&eacute;.<br />-One giant plot hole **(In what order did the other passengers die?).<br /><br />So, what makes it clever?<br />-**The entire concept of cheating death and the rules that go with it.  The mortician conveniently explains the rules and the kids go with it.<br />-**The methods of making people un-alive (here's where Rube Goldburg comes in).  One little act or defect leads to a ridiculous and entertaining chain of events.  Trying to stop death is like playing wack-a-mole the size of a pool table.  You had better be quick.<br />-Despite the \\"hate\\" thing, emotions and dialogue usually seam reasonably believable.  Different personalities react differently; Decent acting for a film of this type.<br />-Special effects are well done.  You may never again want to fly after seeing the opening sequence.<br />-Overall, a well made quality production.<br /><br />About the DVD:<br />-limited extras; lame deleted scenes, \\"when will you die?\\" game (always march 19th no matter what I put in), \\"are you psychic?\\" game, Good documentary about a psychic investigator in California.<br />-An insert.

Overall the album was different and it had my OK, Dukes Travel and Duke's End save the album, and I agree with the reviewers who commented that it was the start of P.Collin solo career.<br /><br />=====================================================================<br />Luis Manuel Mejia (son) - In The previous ...And Then There Were Three... Genesis was reduced to three men, Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford, and while the album had a commercial direction, it didn't reflect the remaining lineup' true talent, until Duke, released in 1980, went being as their greatest album as a trio, and the last one to feature a friendly progressive rock style. Still, while pop eforts where seen in their previous effort, Duke isn't at all a point of transition from prog to pop (as many prog bands were suffering this), it contains a lot of their most awesome experience and experimentation into a more versatile progressive rock, mainly with very strong inclinnations to neo progressive rock and a slight interest in pop. While having their best aproach into neo progressive rock, as its compositions are heavily synthesized but in a focused, intelectual way, its reflections into progressive rock and pop are very present, making it one of the most unique of their albums, and best of all, it doesn't possess an excessive commercial orientation, while being a commercial one, this is best reflected in both hits like the mellodic, confortable Turn It On Again, and the famous but poppy and soft Misunderstanding. Genesis had now entered the 80's and this album marked the return of their \\"dated\\" presentation of their childish drawings, but this is certainly a delight among we true Genesis fans. In contrast to ...And Then There Were Three..., were Tony Banks was the man who dominated the album's most beautiful compositions, Duke's most acclaimed compositions are seen in those songs composed by the three members, best expressed in one of their most delightful instrumental, progressive rock pieces like Duke's Travels, being such a strong, fierceful and intricate song, its difficult to describe it words, and still it possesses a sang part from all the lyrics in the dramatic Guide Vocal, while Duke's End is one of their classic style recalling instrumentals were they recall the best fragments of the album. The opening neo progressive song Behind The Lines also stands as one of the most remarkable, enjoyable and interesting compositions in the album, being composed by the trio, as well as the following Duchess, an emotional, story telling song about a fictional character and his life in the stage, it really reflects one of their most sensitive side. While Banks' compositional talent was the most wonderful delight in their previous album, here he stands as strong as ever, with such dramatical, emotional and reflective compositions such as the simple but straight to business Guide Vocal, the dramatic, fiercefuly potential but comprehensible Cul-De-Sac, and his best in the album, the emotional Heathaze. While Mike Rutherford also expressed a fierceful talent in such songs like the strong but significant Man Of Our Times and the sentimental Alone Tonight. Its obvious even without noticing it that Phil Collins' contributions werw here the most commercial ones, taking off talent from the album, just like Misunderstanding, the worst song inthe album but its so obvious that it is a Collins compositions, and its contributions to Turn It On Again were also notorious, but even though, there is just one song that reflects a perfect emotion in a progressive, serious way; Please Don't Ask, I was really shocked when I saw it was a Collins' composition.In their performance there were some slight changes, of course, this is a Tony Banks album, where he explodes his best keyboard hability and performance, and, while Phil Collins played most of the drums, its also their first album with the incorporation. While some may say Abacab is a better album because they finally put their feet into ground and start their complete basis into a more sophisticated, commercial style, I still really dislike Abacab, as its their first album without any progressive rock, just as Banks and Rutherford may had followed blindly Phil Collins commercial style. But Seriously, if you'd like to see Genesis Collins' era last sparks of talent, power and seriousness but still like more soft, uncompromising but comprehensible albums, Duke will fit perfectly. Track pick: Behind The Lines, Duchess, Heathaze, Man Of Our Times, Cul-De-Sac, Duke's Travels, Duke's End.s so obvious that it is a Collins compositions, and its contributions to Turn It On Again were also notorious, but even though, there is just one song that reflects a perfect emotion in a progressive, serious way; Please Don't Ask, I was really shocked when I saw it was a Collins' composition.In their performance there were some slight changes, of course, this is a Tony Banks album, where he explodes his best keyboard hability and performance, and, while Phil Collins played most of the drums, its also their first album with the incorporation.

0330412744|3.0|Don DeLillo's short novel \\"Cosmopolis\\" (2003) is a tale of modern life filled with violence, money and materialism, the lust for sex and power, the apparently all-encompassing nature of technology and gadgetry, and self-centeredness.  The novel fails because it is too full of itself and loses touch with the world it purports to describe.<br /><br />The novel is set in New York City in April, 2000. The primary character is Eric Packer a wunderkind who at the age of 28 has become a billionaire as an investment manager.  The story takes place over one day as Packer, suffering from sleeplessness and loneliness, decides to get a haircut across town.  He so instructs the crew of his fully-equipped white stretch limo, who advise him that this is not the best of days to be out and about in the streets of New York.  The President of the United States is in town and their have been threats to the President's life and to Packer's own. No matter.  A haircut across town it will be.<br /><br />In addition to insisting on his haircut, Packer shows his stubborness and hubris in another way.  He has taken the most severe risks financially by borrowing money in the currency exchange thinking that the Japanese yen will lose value.  During the course of the day, the yen continues to rise, and Packer goes broke.<br /><br />Packer's day-long journey in his limo is filled with visitors, including his doctor, who examines him every day, various economists and financial advisors, and sexual encounters including one with his young and wealthy wife of 22 days.  There are scenes of riots in the streets, shootings, a suicide by burning, the funeral of a famous rapper of whom Packer is fond, a movie shooting in which 300 extras lie on the street naked, and violence, by and against Packer.<br /><br />Portions of the book, especially the earliest pages, have a directness and immediacy to the writing that hold out promise.  Unfortunately, the book does not succeed.  I think the book's major shorcoming lies in its polemical style and in its attendant excess.  DeLillo has no sympathy with what he perceives to be the modern world of high-tech and high finance.  His writing about it is skewed, shrill, and unconvincing.  On an individual scale, Eric Packer is portrayed as on the whole a brilliant but dislikable character whose human traits have been buried in the pursuit of wealth, power, knowledge, and sex.  With the exception of a few moments, Packer and his fate didn't engage me.  DeLillo draws him simply to fit his ideological vision of the unjust character of modern capitalism and the cataclysmic finish to which he believes it is leading.  Packer's escapades are too outlandish in themselves to be meaningful commentary.  For me the book falls flat.<br /><br />In the book, Packer is shown as computing every logarithm and performing every study to support his belief that the value of the yen \\"must\\" fall. There is a strong message in the book about the limitations of knowledge and of chance -- the folly of thinking that, in any given case, any individual or group can be astute enough to identify and assess all the options and to reach a certain conclusion.  This is wise advise indeed. Alas, in the case of this book, this wisdom is overwhelmed by a mass of stridency, shrillness, and self-certainty in the author in his own critique of aspects of modern life of which he greatly disapproves. The virtues of humility and the sense of human fallibility are valuable traits for writers and social critics -- as well as for billionaire financiers and for those obsessed with money and power.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanand in its attendant excess.

B000002I99|5.0|Musical genius, rock vocalist, actor, theatrical arranger and producer, you name it, Alice can do it. I first bought this album in 1975 when I was 18 years old and I still love it, listen to it, have owned many which have been stolen (others must also love it), and I guess I'll continue listening to it until they lower me into the dirt. Alice Cooper is truly the King of theatrical rock and rock horror.<br /><br />Garry
B000002MIF|5.0|In 1984, I went Licorce Pizza Record Store.  There were two tapes for sale that were guaranteed to by amazing.  First, was REM's Reckoning (and it was amazing).  The other was the The Smith's first record.  I'd never heard of them, but since it was guaranteed, I spent the $4.99 and got.      I was blow away.  I listened to it non-stop.  I could hardly wait for more Smiths.   During Christmas Vacation 1984, I went to a music store and saw this for sale.  It was an import, so it was $9.99, quite a bit of money.  But I bought it.    The music was simply amazing.  I could care less if the obviously gay songs (or maybe not obvious - maybe I'm wrong) were about gay love.  This is a record about the human experience, about love and lonliness. This is record with amazing guitarwork.  This is a record that when you get done listening to it you want to give each member a hug and say \\"It will be alright.\\"    The feeling is of honesty.  Nothing fancy...just perfect songs recorded in less then perfect conditions.      Of course the Queen is Dead is amazing, as is Meat is Murder, but this will always be my favorite.  It is perfect.
1581806574|4.0|The examples in the book are very good but for the more advance young artist.  The pictures would also be good for copying and using as coloring for younger artists.  Would think this book is more for about 10 years and up.
B000UX6THK|4.0|I am very pleased with this definitive set. The picture quality and sound are excellent. However, I was very disappointed that there was no episode guide/booklet enclosed.     I do not have the previous stand alone seasons so I do not know if they are included in those editions. So unfortunately there is no information on any of the episodes. The only thing you have is what is printed on each disc in very tiny print. They did include some random postcards. Where the postcards are inserted it looks like an episode guide could go in there.     So maybe they had plans to have a booklet originally but decided against it due to cost or time and the postcards are an afterthought. I realy have no idea and this is purely conjecture on my part. Otherwise they did a good job putting this set together.
B0000CDL93|5.0|Look, it's a big old bucket full of lies, and one should know this before watching, (Or maybe after, I don't know) but like The Blair Witch Project, the scare comes from it's deception.  This COULDN'T be true, could it?  If it is, the world is a much darker place than I ever suspected.  It's frightening beyond belief.      So while I am a firm believer of the fact that Oswald and Ruby each committed their heinous acts alone, and while I'm somewhat worried about the impact this movie has had on my very suggestible generation, I can't deny that JFK is one of my favorite, most beloved films.  It's fascinating, scary, and very well constructed.  It's also full of terrific performances, although Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald is a bit overrated.  (Did he know anything about Oswald before he took the role?  He was inaccurate, putting it kindly.)        The question is, does Oliver Stone have a responsibility to history or not?  Films like JFK and NIXON are a strong argument that all he's responsible for is his art, and as long as his art conveys his point of view this well, he's deserving of all the praise he's received.        JFK is a vital, wonderful film.
B000F3T3E6|3.0|While Dessay gives a lovely performance as Bellezza, and Hallenberg is fine as Piacere, the tenor and alto absolutely do not. The tenor bottoms out on a number of occasions, and while I love Sonia Prina in other recordings, she is not really a true alto. She also hits bottom, and on the occasions that Tempo and Disinganno are paired the voices fail completely to match. Such a pity. Tempos are too variable for me--the fast is a little fast at times and the slow drags and is missing energy. Such a disappointment. I bought this mostly because I was interested to see what Prina would make of this role, but I much prefer the older Minkowski recording with Nathalie Stutzmann, a true alto, as Disinganno and John Elwes as Tempo. The voices of these singers match so closely in their duet Il pianto dell'aurora that it is difficult to tell which singer is which--their unisons are exquisite. Prina and Breslik on the same piece do not work at all well. She is not only out-matched but the unisons barely sound.--she is much more comfortable at the octave. Prina does not sound good here, a severe disappointment after her fabulous performance as Megacle on the Naive recording of Vivaldi's L'Olympiade. I thought she had bottom notes, but alas no.    The quartet at the end of the first disc is also incredibly disappointing. There is no energy here. And this despite some, at times, overly prolific ornamentation from all of these singers in earlier tracks. The second quartet is better but is too fast and the interplay of the vocal lines is lost in the rush, particularly the relationship between the alto and tenor. Prina is completely overwhelmed in this quartet and can barely be heard--hard in this context to believe that Disinganno could possibly triumph by the end of this.    The Minkowski disc is long out of print now, and very hard to get. It took me a good year to track one down on ebay, but it was well worth the wait and if I had to recommend a recording I'd still choose Minkowskiover all others. I don't know the Alessandrini recording but am generally not a huge fan of Mingardo (my own quirkiness, I'm sure, but I'm just not crazy about her voice, especially at the bottom of her range, which also promises much but fails to deliver).
075640407X|5.0|I don't read many novels, mostly technical books, but this was recommended on one of the blogs I frequent. Within a day I had ordered the book and within minutes of cracking the book I was hooked. If you enjoy a good fantasy novel, you don't want to miss this one.
B000002KOG|5.0|This CD is a great work.  I have purchased it probably six times in the last 30 years and somehow it always seems to disappear (a bit suspicious, I must say.)  From the haunting \\"Here we are in the years\\" and \\"I've loved her so long\\" to the upbeat \\"The Loner\\" it never fails to lift my spirits.  There's just something about vintage Neil that has yet to be duplicated by another artist.  His melancholy guitar seems to weep at times and then pick you up and soar on the next track.  The opening track is a little bit of genius and prepares you for what's to come.  Sheer joy.
B00000272N|4.0|Facelift (1990.), Alice In Chains' first studio album<br /><br />Alice In Chains' debut album is sandwiched at a pretty much transitional point where music was going at the time. `Facelift' was released in 1990, at a time when hair metal still dominated the music scene. The band themselves were rooted stylistically in hair metal, however by the time they got round to releasing their debut, their style had altered somewhat. Here now was a band which portrayed downcast themes and had unsettling undertones to their sound but was at the same time undeniably a heavy metal band. In effect in `Facelift' we have the stylings of grunge before grunge actually broke into widespread attention...<br /><br />`Facelift' itself at the time gave a new injection of life into the metal scene and enjoyed considerable success (Alice In Chains were probably the first of the bands eventually tagged under `grunge' to enjoy any decent air play). `Facelift' captures the great Alice In Chains at their most raw and heavy. The sound of the band is not quite yet at their definitive sound as seen on `Dirt'. 'Dirt' is much more difficult, has off-kilter guitar and vocal lines and has an overly stately style. On `Facelift', the music has a little more pace to it and the album also has an undeniably `80's metal edge to it. That by no means detracts from the albums style especially when you see the quirky edge that the album is given by Layne Staley's warped and unusual vocal style and Jerry Cantrell's definitive solos. Here we have a heavy metal style combined with an unusual and cutting edge that intrigued and sparked listeners at the time and still does to this day. `Facelift' for me is not the band's finest work, that honour goes to `Dirt' but it is a fantastic debut album in its own right that still sounds fresh to this day. The musicianship across the album is excellent and the songwriting has its shining moments. The first half of the album is particularly strong, who indeed can forget `Sea Of Sorrow' or the two great hit singles in `We Die Young' and `Man In The Box'. With these songs and some of the others on the album, the band was able to combine a great element of catchiness and listenability with a large serving of grinding and sometimes dissonant riffs that have a strangely infectious nature to them. The Jerry Cantrell and Layne Staley songwriting partnership which I have often stated as one of the great writing partnerships of `90's music is strong on this album from the start. Staley sings throughout the album with a great deal of intent and power and it really gives a strong angle to the underlying crunching riffs. In some ways he is at his most expressive on this album.<br /><br />Alice In Chains kick off their debut with the intentful opener `We Die Young'. From the start we have a classic, definitive AIC song. Plenty of crunching riffs fill out this short opener over which Staley sounds almost anthemic in his vocal delivery. The signature tunes keep flowing with another famous AIC track in `Man In The Box'. A slower song with a awesome but dissonant sounding riff. Jerry Cantrell's solo on this one is excellent and he also provides some excellent backing to Staley's vocals which creates a really interesting feel to the song. `Sea Of Sorrow' has an atmospheric piano opening that gives way to a lengthy but rather catchy tune, especially with the chorus. `Bleed The Freak' continues in the same vein with good emphasis on heaviness. Staley's vocals are on fine form here. `I Cant Remeber' has a good mix of electric and acoustic sections. The yearning outro has quite an `80's feel to it yet it also has that warped AIC edge. It makes for awesome listening. `Love, Hate, Love' is a creepy epic that carves its way though in a slow but cutting style.<br /><br />Some awesome spread out chords lead in to `It Ain't Like That'. More pounding riffs that are filled with intent right though to the end on this one. `Sunshine' has a slow country rock edge to it during the verse lines that cleverly picks up tempo in the chorus lines. `Put You Down' is shorter but incredibly catchy. The rhythm to the song is incredibly memorable and Staley mixes up his vocal styles well. `Confusion' has a slow pace and reflective feel. Theres a nice bass feel to this one, especially in the early song. The track as a whole does drag out a little towards the end and could have been cut shorter. `I Know Something (`Bout You')' is enjoyable and quite funky in style. Never a track that gets boring. `Real Thing' is an edgy but atmospheric finisher that makes a thrilling closing listen. Layne Staley's vocal style cleverly allows some clever shifts in the song's speed. An excellent closer to an excellent debut.<br /><br />`Facelift' marked a really promising start to Alice In Chains' career. An album that lies in transition between two decades of music, it is a fantastic taster of what was to come from the band as they rose to great popularity during the grunge craze. Although not as definitive as later releases by the band which explore the moodiness and sludgy sound of the band to the greatest degree, `Facelift' is an excellent display of heavy metal with a rather warped edge. Although I would advise Alice In Chains newbies to begin with the band's definitive release `Dirt', I would highly recommend this great debut to anyone who enjoys the music of Alice In Chains.<br /><br />MY RATING: 8/10rly picks up tempo in the chorus lines. `Put You Down' is shorter but incredibly catchy.

B000784WMW|5.0|Last night I finished re-watching \\"Jane Eyre\\" (1983), the BBC mini-series adapted from Charlotte Bronte's Gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of English literature with Timothy Dalton (my favorite James Bond) as Mr. Edward Rochester and Zelah Clarke, as Jane Eyre, a poor orphaned 18-year-old girl, a governess at Mr. Rochester's estate, Thornfield. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been one of my most beloved books since I was an 11-years-old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words, \\"This book is amazing\\" and so it was and I have read it dozens of times and I am still not tired of it. Its beautiful language, refined, fragrant, and surprisingly fresh, the dialogs, and above all, two main characters, and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been adapted to TV and big screen many times, 18 according to IMDb. The actors as famous and marvelous as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Samantha Morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society, laws, religion, by the differences in age, backgrounds, experiences, and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years. Of all these films I've only seen one, 300 minutes long BBC version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where Timothy Dalton who frequently plays dark, brooding characters does not just played Edward Rochester brilliantly and with class, he WAS Mr. Rochester - sardonic, vibrant, the force of nature, powerful, passionate, sexy, and tormented master of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke was also convincing as sweet, gentle, intelligent and strong Jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning, and quiet but firm willpower.
B000VDDDY6|2.0|HD sounds like a good idea, but which one!  Is HD worth the extra cost in any format?  I have over 1000 DVDs (including the standard edition of Star Trek Season 1), I'm not about to purchase my collection again in a new format. Standard dvd has proven itself. I believe this collection is a poor value. Considering I already own the original effects version, I'll wait for the remastered episodes to be released as a stand alone set and in Standard DVD.<br /><br />Review Update 5-11-2009: I finally purchased this set now that the price is reasonable. The episodes look great. I'm quite satisfied with SD quality. As we all know, HD-DVD is dead and Blu-Ray is the HD of today. It figures. After doing some research, I found that HD-DVD was better than Blu-Ray. Compare Beta to VHS: Beta was of higher quality, but VHS held more video, so it won. I'm going to stick with SD.
B000PFUAO6|1.0|Wow.  Well.  My first paddle in the sea of Dream Theater came in 1992 when a drummer friend let me hear Images And Words.  I was hesitant at first, and thought they were trying a little TOO hard... but after a few listens it just clicked with me and I got it.  I knew exactly what they were doing, and why.  I loved them from then on.    I enjoyed everything that they released, including the much hated Falling Into Infinity album, and was one of the few of my circle to prefer disc two of Six Degrees to disc one.    Having watched them on tour from the Awake tour right up until the Octavarium tour, I was very disappointed when (on the Octavarium tour) they started to dredge up more old songs than new songs.  The last two tours have left me bitterly disappointed with their choice of set list and I considered saving myself hundreds in travel and hotels by avoiding their next tour.  I figured they were on a nostalgia trip and I yearned for them to just do something spectacular by playing their new material for those of us who longed for something new.    Well, I got something new.  I got Systematic Chaos.  I can't say exactly how many times I've listened to it, but I still don't like it.  I don't like ANY of it to be honest.  It's self important, yet it hasn't been written with enough lyrical intelligence to pass it off properly.  The vocals seem tired and lazy, as though LaBrie knows that we're just listening to Rudess and Petrucci battle it out.. once again.  Portnoy is, as always, technically proficient but hey... if you want to be in a thrash band, then join a thrash band.    I had tickets for the latest tour.  I didn't go.  I'm glad.    Sorry DT, but this outing was the last chance for you guys as far as my own personal expenditure is concerned.  From this point, I can't really call myself a fan anymore.  If someone lets me hear their copy of the next CD then I'll give it a listen but unless it changes dramatically into the realms of musicality rather than prententious nonsense then I won't be buying it myself.    Oh.. and while I remember... the last two albums... Muse do it so much better themselves, so imitation is far from flattery when you fail guys.  Give up on trying to sound like Muse, you're Dream Theater... you've been around longer than them and have your own distinct style (or you did!) so try and get hold of your own identity again before it's too late.

B00003CX5P|4.0|I believe George Lucas said he was inspired by the chariot race in the 1959 epic Ben-Hur, and thought of it often when he staged the big pod race scene in this movie.    So, when I watched the film again the other day, the third or fourth time I've seen it, I kept looking for comparisons. Well, suffice to say nothing will surpass that chariot race, which had no benefit of any special-effects while this was almost all computer-generated. Nevertheless, the pod race in here was a lot of fun to watch, had excellent surround sound, was exciting and the highlight of the film. Oddly, in this movie instead of a man you have a small boy as the good guy- driver, so to speak. Young Jake Lloyd who plays \\"Anakin Skywalker.\\" He's the key character in this Star Wars saga, the boy who later becomes the father to Luke Skywalker and winds up being revealed as Darth Vader. But....this is long before that    This movie, the first Star Wars movie after a long hiatus (16-years) disappointed a lot of fans but I thought it was entertaining overall. My main complaint was trying to understand \\"Jar Jar Binks,\\" but on the DVD I can use English subtitles and thus understand all the strange things he says with his Caribbean accent. It makes the movie more enjoyable and I strongly recommend doing that.    As usual, there is a ton of astounding visuals in here, all kinds of strange characters and excellent \\"effects.\\" Yes, the action gets hokey in spots, especially near the end, but what modern-day action film doesn't?    People who are really \\"into\\" this Star Wars saga, and take it seriously, were, as mentioned generally let down with this movie. I guess they expected a lot more after waiting so long for the next installment. I just watch it for the enjoyment of an escapist film and as someone who usually enjoys good visuals. I repeat: put on the \\"English subtitles.\\" That helped a lot, believe me.
0743454537|5.0|This the third Picoult novel I have read, behind Nineteen Minutes and The Pact. Let me tell you, I was not dissapointed.   I have been enthralled by Picoult's writing since the first page. This book is the same. I read it in 48 hours, and wanted it to last forever. It is capitvating, and definitely makes you think.   One thing I love about Picoult's stories is that I always picture myself in these situations - they could just as easily happen to my family as anyone else.   I really don't know what else to say without making this review 2 pages long - just read it. You won't be let down.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|If you like dry or dark humor, you should get a big kick out of this movie. I know I did. If you are between 12-20 you might even like it more because this deals with high school kids primarily. However, there are some adults in here who play key roles, too.    The teens and the adults have a couple of things in common: they are nerds and weird people and they are ALL hilarious. They also are unlike a cast of characters you have seen in any other movie. In other words, this movie is an \\"original.\\"    I didn't know any of these actors and I think that helped. It made it even more original, looking at new faces. That begins with the title character, played by Jon Heder. A white kid in Idaho with a afro haircut, over-sized glasses, moon boots and an unpredictable and low-key personality unlike anyone I've ever seen in other films. Even though he's pictured as a huge nerd, he surprises you all the time. Just when you think you have this kid figured out, he does something unexpected. Whatever, he's fun to watch and hear throughout the movie.    Suffice to say \\"Napoleon\\" and about everyone in this film is totally whacked and all of them - male, female, young, old, good and bad people are extremely entertaining. A lot of the humor is visual, meaning the looks and reactions on these character's faces and the weird deadpan lines they deliver. Are there stereotypes in here? Yes, like the bimbo, prettiest girl in school running for class president , and her stupid, macho boyfriend, but most of the people were pretty unique.    If you like absurd humor, this is your cup of tea, and you don't have to be a teen to enjoy this. Hey, I'm old enough to be Napoleon's grandfather and I laughed my butt off from the beginning to the end of this unconventional film.
B000001GX8|5.0|For those who quibble with this recording's pacing & pedigree, I offer this new & different perspective - this \\"Figaro\\" is entirely in the spirit of the source material, which is to say Beaumarchais' delightful comedy of class & manners. It's in no way over-wrought or over-sung, as many recordings of \\"Figaro\\" are, and reflects many of the rhythm changes Mozart intended (and which keep the tempo from becoming repetitive.) After all, who wants to see the singers racing to the end of each track with no regard for the music or the underlying dramatic story (especially in some of the most beautiful arias Mozart ever wrote?) Bohm's conducting is unsurpassable, each of the cast in \\"mellifluous\\" voice and the orchestra vibrant & dynamic. If you're in doubt, purchase several different recordings & compare them - I guarantee you'll come back to this one time & time again.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|This was a very pleasant surprise, far better than I had ever hoped, filled with fabulous cinematography and riveting story about the life of arms dealer during the 1980s and '90s.. Those who appreciate an interesting story and great visuals will like this one.    Nicholas Cage was terrific as the lead character, \\"Yuri Orlov.\\" I loved his narration, too. How much of what he said is true, I have no idea, but it's fascinating stuff.     I felt those visuals, combined with the outstanding acting and always-interesting story made this a good film. It also proved you don't need action every two minutes to keep a film involving for the audience. This has just the right amount of drama, suspense, action, romance and, yes, even humor.     I do have to warn some that the message is a pessimistic one: that evil always wins in the world. According to Bible of \\"Yuri,\\" in the end, the meek won't inherit the earth; the arms dealers will and that evil rules, so why fight it and yourself over it? Wow, what uplifting words to live by.     Outside of Yuri's wife \\"Ava\\" (Bridget Moynahan) and the man who pursues him, \\"Jack Valentine\\" (Ethan Hawke) no one in here has much in the way of high-ground morals. At least they made the lawman an honest; that's rare in films today.     Amir Mokri is the cinematographer and Andrew Niccol, the director, who combined to make this movie look so stylish and beautiful to see. Looking at Mokri's resume, I see he's done a number of stylish films. Niccol hasn't directed much but what he has also offers interesting visuals.    Looking at the front and back cover of the DVD might make you think this is just another of these brainless action flicks, but it is not. This is solid film, despite the pessimism.

B000R4SMCW|5.0|If you like courtroom dramas, appreciate excellent acting and an expertly-filmed movie this is for you. Only once, I think, have I ever proclaimed something \\"best movie of the year\\" and all that, because it's all too subjective and also a cliché but that's how I feel about this movie unless something better comes along the last few months of 2007.    This is just a fabulous movie with Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling playing characters who engage in a battle of wits. Hopkins plays a husband who discovers his wife having an affair, shoots her, confesses the same night and then has things cleverly arranged where it's almost impossible to convict him. Gosling plays a young, hotshot prosecuting attorney on his way to bigger and better things with a change of scenery to corporate law but gets stuck with this open-and-shut case right before he switches firms. The trouble is, it's a lot more than he figured and he isn't used to losing. Hopkins knows this, of course, and plays on his vanity.     Gosling evolves from a me-only lawyer to someone who really wants justice, even if it costs him. Both characters are cocky and smart and the twists and turns just add to the fun.    I enjoyed watching all the actors performances and was very impressed. The camera-work by Director Of Photography Kramer Morgenthau should also be recognized, along with director Gregory Hoblit, who seems to direct very entertaining films (\\"Frequency,\\" \\"Fallen,\\" etc.)     I could have watched this story unfold for another two hours and would have been happy to do so, am I'm not one to sit still for long periods these days. That's how good this was....just Grade A film-making and storytelling.
B000SQJ27I|5.0|Once again Manu has brought Musical Bliss and crosses language boundries with La Radiolina, it is wonderful to finally hear the studio releases  of songs like El Hoyo, Tristeza Maleza, and Mala Fama after hearing countless live versions, listeners are are bombarded with audio montages which Manu is fameous for the words of The Bleedin Clown still echo thru my ears and my 5 year old son \\"The Gabester\\" can't get enough of Mama Cuchara and Politik Kills, the message of the musical \\"Traveling Political Junkie\\" Lives on and shall echo across the airwaves of Radio Clandestino ...................  The Splinkster
B000QUCNOK|4.0|Wow, this is really a bizarre story with an ending that probably will turn off 98 percent of viewers who stick with this two hours, 147-minute film. I'm not sure what to make of it, other than totally understanding if people are left unsatisfied after watching this movie. As I said, I'm not sure how to interpret it as I just finished it minutes ago. It leaves you almost stunned.    Rather than judging that finale or divulging it, let me just comment on the first two hours of the film, which I found utterly fascinating. If I wasn't such an admirer of photography, art and special-effects, I doubt I would have found the movie so appealing because the story is \\"not for everyone.\\" However, thanks to stunning French city and countryside scenery, 18th century period and beautiful women it enhanced the story to me. Yet, regardless of the visual treats, the story was so unusual it still would have held my attention.     Ben Wishaw, who plays the lead character \\"Jean-Baptist Grenouille, has a face that is perfect for this role. His emaciated body, which survived a brutal childhood existence from the moment he was born also makes his character all the more credible. The looks of shock and awe on this man's face throughout the picture also add to his believability. He was mesmerizing with his haunting expressions. Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman provide \\"name\\" actors the film but it's Wishaw's movie, all the way.    I can only recommend this movie to those who share similar interests in cinematography and who like a \\"different\\" story but there are so many things in here - especially the ending - that could offend so many people, I would be hesitant to recommend this to the general viewer.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|O.K., I admit it, I have some prejudices.  As an American Evangelical, I'm required by law to be somewhat conservative, and that would entail eschewing Michael Moore and his films.  Anyway, he's fat and ugly and has an attitude.  What's to not like?  Consequently I have not seen any of his films to date. But I waxed heretical today and decided to view the 11:15am matinee of his latest film, \\"Sicko\\".  And I'm glad I did.  My first shock was the packed parking lot at the local theatre.  If anyone doesn't believe that the film media wields a profound influence on the American psyche, they need to try to find a parking place at the local cinema.<br /><br /> As I have admitted, I haven't seen any of Moore's other films, so I can't critique his documentary technique - whether it is moore [sic] of the same or something fresh.  Detractors will charge that his stuff is pure propaganda.  Well, what isn't?  At least he's upfront about it.  And his style is entertaining.  After all it is an American audience and you have to entertain them, even if it's the news.  He skillfully moves the film along with the proper mix and rhythms of humor, seriousness, and tragedy.  His greatest weakness, however, is his use of music.  Sometimes it works, but it is mostly schmaltzy, cheesy, and way overdone.  I can't believe he used Barber's \\"Adagio for Strings\\" again.  I can't listen to the piece any more without craving popcorn.  It's become as ubiquitous as Taco Bell's Cannon.<br /><br /> Michael Moore is an \\"aginner\\", so we know his conclusion before he argues it.  The question is whether or not he has a significant claim and a valid argument. I believe he has both.  Having lost my mother and my mother-in-law recently after protracted illnesses, I have had lots of first hand experience with Moore's subject.  Watching healthcare insurance premiums rise to the point of rivaling mortgage payments for the number one budget item while insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare organizations stack up obscene profits makes one wonder when someone is going to wake up.  Moore gives a rationale for why no one has.  Even if he is heavy handed and manipulative, (remember it is propaganda), he has gotten it pretty much right.<br /><br /> The defense for changing the system has always been the fear of socialism and the negative examples have always been the allegedly inadequate systems of Europe, especially Canada, England and France.  Moore takes the audience on a travelogue worthy of the Travel Channel.  It seems when you talk to the people who live in these countries, they don't tell the same story that we hear in the States.  I have a number of European friends and they tell me a story a lot closer to Moore's than the received text we get stateside, so I have reason to trust Moore on this one.<br /><br /> Moore's coup de grace is his excursion to Cuba via Gitmo with a boatload of 9/11 \\"heroes\\" who can't get health care for their 9/11 maladies.  Not only can they buy $120 meds for 5 cents in Cuba, but they get hospital stay and doctor care for free.  These are Americans in communist Cuba for heaven's sake. Could this be just a ploy of the Cuban government to make us look bad?  I don't think so.  But don't take my word for it.  Go see it for yourself.

B000F1IQNM|5.0|This was a pleasant surprise, much better than I anticipated. I figured Emma Thompson would be good in the title role because you can usually count on her to be entertaining in form or another, cerebrally, emotionally or comically. What I didn't figure on was the fun, extremely colorful story, overall. This DVD was like a banana split for your senses - all kinds of wild treats for the eyes and ears.....to taste, so to speak.    This film features outrageous color schemes from the word \\"go,\\" from the interior of the \\"Brown's\\" house, to everyone's apparel to the scenery outside. It almost reminded me \\"The Cat In The Hat\\" with its crazy colors.     All the characters are as exaggerated as the colors, too. The kids may be brats but they aren't bad once they get some needed discipline and love from Nanny McPhee. They are still fun to watch, and all are quite different in appearance and mannerisms. Thompson is a howl as Mary Poppins-like McPhee and so are the supporting characters. There were no sappy songs, either. This is not a musical.    Only the final wedding segment got carried away with juvenile silliness; the rest was fun for adults and well as the kids, who must have loved this all the way through. This is simply good entertainment and highly recommended.
0838577016|3.0|I wanted to forewarn other users, especially students, of the pitfalls of the digital upgrade option:<br /><br />1) Don't buy the upgrade if you're hoping to get access to it through the library computers, instead of having to lug the massive book to school.  Apparently, you cannot view any online book from more than 7 different computers within a 30 day period.  And, consequently, if the cache happens to get cleared after each session (as is the case with most shared computers), then you're limited to only 7 sessions with ANY computer.<br /><br />2) Beware that the book is hard to read online.  It's great for adding annotations (highlighting text, adding bookmarks, typing notes, etc.), but it's a real strain on the eyes if you try to read a full chapter.  The text is low contrast (gray on white) and low resolution.  Even when you use the Zoom-in feature (which lets you increase the size a little bit), it's still hard on the eyes.  The text is still just blurry enough to make you think you might need glasses.  After several chapters, you probably will need glasses :-)<br /><br />p.s.  I have continued to try to use the digital updgrade (through Amazon Online Reader), and have encountered another major issue that I wanted to warn others about...  Don't rely on the online reader for note taking.  As technology is notorious for, you risk loosing everything.  I like to use the highlight and bookmark feature, but after a day of reading and annotating, I just found that everything I've done in the past 24 hours has been lost.  The digital reader may become more of a liability than a feature worth paying for.
6303823351|5.0|I want to be a teenager again!<br />What great memories this movie brought back for me.<br />Does it get any better????
B000IU3XTW|5.0|Yes, this is an entirely accoustic album, and I wish I had known that before I bought it since it was something of a shock (not that it really would have changed my mind; it was the only Foo Fighters CD I didn't have that they had in the store). Beyond the intial shock of an entirely accoustic Foo Fighters album, there was really nothing wrong with it.  I've actually found the accoustic versions are more personal, especially \\"Everlong\\" which becomes more haunting without electric guitar. The only \\"akward\\" (for lack of a better word) song is \\"Best of You,\\" which Grohl tries to carry the song almost entirely with his voice, but sadly doesn't work too well considering he screams most of the song instead of really singing it. Aside from \\"Best of You\\" the vocals (specifically Dave Grohl's) on this album are shockingly close to the studio versions, which is a huge plus considering some live albums sound nothing like the originals. The new arrangments of the songs are nice and \\"Cold Day in the Sun\\" seems more uptempo live than in the studio.    When all is said and done, this album is a great investment, especially if you enjoy accoustic music (or in this case \\"aFOOstic\\"), want to try the Foo Fighters but are slightly afraid, or need something to tide you over until the release of the Foo Fighter's next CD on September 25.
B000NTPDK0|5.0|How much of this is as real about the Queen? She has always been so dedicated and stoic. This movie made me think of her in a different light--from her side of it all.<br />Helen Mirren---was the BEST---I love everything she does.<br />She nailed this one!
B0000DIJO2|4.0|Having been around since the beginning with these guys, this maybe one of the best concerts I've ever seen period.The music is great and the vocals are out of this world. I figured it would be good but it was great instead. 5 Stars is reserved for Beatle music only, so I had to go with 4. Don't waste any more time and buy this one.
B00005JLPK|5.0|This movie was great all the way around-the scenery-the actors-the story line!<br />I really enjoyed it. Plus I learned about an artist I probably never would have....what a woman she was.....
B000E6GBV2|5.0|In a world full of radio hype and american idols this album really stands out.    I had not heard of these guys until a friend invited me to one of their shows.  The show was great so I decided to buy the album with some hesitation.  I have seen a lot of great shows only to be disappointed in the album.  Some bands and musicians have a hard time translating the on stage energy to their album, BUT NOT THESE GUYS.  I have enjoyed the album as much as the show.        Ben Bridwell has a unique and refreshing vocal style and the music rocks!  Check it out.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I have tried to buy this DVD twice before from non-Amazon Internet vendors and failed. Finally I bought it from Amazon. It is really wonderful to watch \\"It's a wonderful life\\". I especially enjoyed the special features of the DVD with Capra Sr. and Jr. and Jimmy Stewart recapturing the making and the history of this movie. Can you imagine it wasn't a hit when it was first released? It is a very interesting story, almost as good as the movie itself.
B000244EMO|4.0|After twenty years this is still one of the quintessential action movies.  Better than it's sequel and far, far superior to AVP.  I place it right next to Aliens as one of the best sci-fi movies ever.  With few exceptions the FX are on par with those seen in today's films.  The casting is nearly flawless, I not talking about great actors here, what I mean is they are perfectly cast in these roles.  Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, and Sonny Landham really make you believe in these guys.  Sure they're over the top and comic book like with bulging muscles but the way they are portrayed makes you actually give a damn about what happens to them.  Even thought Arnold wins in the end it costs him his entire team to achieve victory, if you can call it that.    The DVD itself has a lot of great behind the scenes stuff.  The transfer of the movie could have been better but it is twenty years old so I can't expect it to look perfect.  Great film.
B000002MZ6|5.0|I am a audiophile and big fan of electronic and instrumental music. This album from Mike Oldfield is simply out of this world!  It hits all the right buttons.  I am listening this album as I'm writing this review using my highend headphone -- STAX SR-007 Omega II, and I am completely emerged in the music.     I only listened to all the samples of all other Oldfield's albums and this one really touched me.      Highly recommended.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|this is the first hd-dvd title i've experienced on my plasma tv. it's worth every penny. it's visually stunning and captivating. your plasma/lcd will shine when playing this documentary (it might also get a good workout). if you only plan on purchasing one hd-dvd title make sure this is it!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|My review:  Great movie.    Now let me just get something off my chest.  I am glad GRINDHOUSE is being released as two movies.  It should be.  They are two separate movies.  The double feature is a theatrical thing and can not be re-created on the small screen if they tired.      For those of you who missed it in theater...I am sorry.  You will eventually get your chance to see them together, but you will not get that experience you missed on the big screen in your local slum theater.    The movies being released on DVD are also in their full length glory.  Why pay for a movie that has 30 minutes cut out of it.  It worked for GRINDHOUSE, but what you will be buying is DEATH PROOF (30 mins) and PLANET TERROR (15 mins).      As for the trailers.  I am disappointed that they have not said that they are on the DVD, but maybe they will be.    Maybe it's because I watch all movies at my local Drive-In that I don't see what the big deal is.  I get double features all the time, and never complain about the two movies I watch on the big screen not coming out together.  Remember, they (Tarantino, Rodriguez) were trying to give the audience a old school theatrical experience.  They never said they were going to give you that same experience at your house.  You can always get both DVDs and play them back to back like a real double feature...and you'll get more movie now.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|My daughter brought this over for us to watch one afternoon. The movie didn't quite click.  However we discussed the possible plots of the movie for over an hour.  We looked on the main page and found the extra \\"hints\\" at the bottom right.  Suddenly the whole movie made sense.  There were still some items to discuss, but we thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the discussion.    However, it's not the type of movie a person can pick up on a whim and not expect to spend some time really thinking about it. I had been warned.    I'm going to have to watch it another few times!
0743289684|5.0|Bought this book because I was impressed with the grace and class with which the author handled herself in a TV interview with a boorish Canadian twit. I wasn't expecting much, but I needed something for an 8 hour plane ride. WOW! Could NOT put the thing down. The author is not a native English speaker, but you'd never know from her writing. Her story is riveting and compelling...and very well told.
0060763280|4.0|T Harv presents many time honored principles about how your way of thinking affects the reality you live.  Who can argue with the idea that having a positive attitude about money (or anything else) is a good thing?  He gets to the root of the problem with his idea of the \\"Money Blueprint\\" and then goes on to inform of various other ways we sabotage our path to wealth.  The hit-yourself-in-the-forehead-and-declare-that \\"I could have had a V-8\\" (OK OK ... \\"I have a millionaire mind!\\") is a little hokey but it does reinforce the idea presented and encourages the reader to DO SOMETHING.      Focusing primarily on money is one of the limitations of this and many other similar books ... there is a lot more to our quality of life than money.  But, since money impacts so many aspects of our lives, it's something we all have to deal with.  The book has some great ideas, many useful quotes and one liners about how to think \\"better\\" about money and is easy to read.    Definitely worth the effort in any event.
0743454537|4.0|As someone else wrote, if you tend to invest yourself emotionally while reading a novel you need to think twice before reading this one.<br /><br />MSK was clearly researched extensively and written carefully, with characters that are well drawn and voiced. With the exception of the mother (who is at times an unsympathetic character) I liked each of the characters - especially Picoult's depictions of Brian and Campbell. I find it is often difficult to care about male characters voiced by women - but she did a superb job here. These characters seemed real and Brian provided a good portion of the story's heart. The main character, Anna, was also likeable and you flip-flop alongside her as she tries to make her decision about what to do: be her own person or be what her family needs. I enjoyed the subplot between Campbell and Julia. It was helpful to have another interesting story to briefly take my mind off of the organ donation issue. And I also enjoyed the alternating points of view (though the different fonts were overkill) - the switching of perspective showed us where each character was emotionally.<br /><br />But when it comes to the reader's own emotions, be prepared. If you are the type of reader who comes to care for the characters, this is a hard book to take. My caution at the beginning of this review was in regard to the ending. I didn't see it as a \\"shock\\" so much as an unnecessary twist. It was unsatisfying and although the main plot was resolved, it was not resolved in a way that teaches us the right lesson. There are lessons here, to be sure...tough ones. But I don't think we learned the right one or got the answers we sought when all was said and done. For that, I took off a star.
B000IFQLSW|4.0|I watched the DVD with my 14 and 11 year olds.  Both upcoming guitarists.  Neither of them are hardcore Blues fans, but both applauded at the credits which spoke volumes to me.  I really send my props to KWS for this project.  He stayed in the background and let the 'guests' be the center of attention.  He did get a chance to show his stuff on a few occasions through the film.  The live audio was impressive throughout, especially the Leadbelly cemetery scene where it was studio quality, it was so good it looked fake.  Re the filming, while I understand the style they were trying to portray, the shaky cams, off framing, etc. I thought it was overused.  The BB King footage was weak at best, the audio was good.  Yeah, I know I was supposed to be \\"like there\\" but if I was, I would have gotten there earlier to get a better seat.  Overall, I'm totally happy with product and really thankful that someone took the time to put this together.  That generation of blues performers are disappearing daily (we lost 3 since the filming).  buy it.

0790731452|4.0|While searching for Pierce Brosnan films, I ran into one of my best friends who suggested this movie.  He never lets me down and knows my taste (besides that he realizes I like Pierce for his looks). This movie is hysterical!  What a fantastic spoof on Sci-fi!  The imaginative thoughts of Tim Burton is so clear in this 1996 film!  The plot is a little weak, hence the 4 not 5 stars.  It's basically about Martians that come to earth supposedly in peace, but cultural misunderstandings take place and this sets the mood for the movie.  The Martians kidnap and lazer attack some earthlings while they were here visiting. However, they couldn't kill Pierce Brosnan (who would want that handsome head dead)?  WHAT A CAST!  There are so many headliners in here it is hard to name them all.  Jack Nicholson, Pierce Brosnan, Glenn Close, Annette Benning, Danny DeVito, Rod Steiger, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox, Tom Jones amd Jack Black just to name a few.  I couldn't stop laughing!  Highly entertaining and a fun movie to enjoy!  A great buy!
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|It's tragic, not giving this disc 5 stars.  The film deserves more then 5 stars.  But the commentary, is so unbelievably poor, it's almost beyond belief.  It's as if this person hasn't seen it in a while, and just gave some worthless criticisms as he watched it for the second time.  I've had discussions with friends while watching this film that would be 100 times more interesting, and enlightening.  Like someone else suggested, please Criterion, do a serious release of this phenomenal film.
0385338902|4.0|I loved that this book is written from a man's perspective about a time in his life that is so vulnerable and sensitive. It was refreshing and funny and even sad at times. A very good story that I didn't want to end. This was a quick, easy read that I really enjoyed and have passed on to others already.

B000T05R90|4.0|The first track on the 1967 American release of \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" [Tower ST 5093] is the Syd Barrett gem, \\"See Emily Play.\\" This is arguably the best song the Floyd ever recorded, but in England it was originally released only as a single. Since this new 2 cd re-release of Piper is the English album, \\"Emily\\" is not included. Floyd lovers may prefer to purchase the 3 cd set, \\"LIMITED EDITION - EXTRA TRACKS\\" scheduled for 9/11/07 release which includes \\"Emily\\" along with other singles from the period.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|I bought the original DVD (not Dir. Cut).  The disc won't play in my DVD player.  It just keeps saying \\"reading\\" (aka searching for the disc that's in the player).  All of my other DVDs work, though.    Well, there's a waste of $7.
0316166685|3.0|This was an engrossing, sweet and sad novel and I would recommend it. I could not put it down. That said, I had to knock off two stars because I found the ending disppointing in comparision to the rest of the novel.    Spoilers    The body inhabitation sequence was ridiculous and damaged alot of the goodwill the story had built up with me to that point. I found it disturbing, contrary to several themes of the book and I did not understand how it forwarded the plot or developed the characters in any meaningful way. The idea that a girl whose last moments on earth were spent being brutally raped would choose to spend her limited return time on earth having sex rather than visiting her family or stopping her killer from attacking other young girls was dumb and disappoining. Not to mention the idea that she used her friend's body to have sex I find to be a huge violation and deeply immoral. One could argue that is a form of sexual violation, which in light of the plot of this novel, is a disturbing and awful plot development.      I also was unsatified by the ending in numerous respects. I found her mother's behavior to be awful and deplorable (particularly her ignorant complicity in allowing Mr. Harvey to escape) but I wanted to understand why she reacted to Suzie's death in such a manner, but I never did. I don't believe that she would be welcomed back into the family after abandoning them. I was not satisfied with Mr. Harvey's story arc ending.    I was disappointing in the ending but I would still recommend the book because the firt 85% of the novel is outstanding, beautiful, unique and worthy of a large audience.
B000002C2E|5.0|EXCELLENT MUSIC.  I don't give five stars to every Bob Dylan Album.  I have been disappointed sometimes--even when many folks gave five stars.  This one is a VERY VERY good one--TRUST ME ON THIS.  Bob did this album in his late 50's & shows us he still has it!  The first song, Love Sick, sounds a little eerie (on purpose), and it's a top favorite for many--among others on this album.
B000P2A256|5.0|I got this album the week it came out and I JUST stopped listening to it weekly.  I have to say first of all I was not a fan of the first album (sorry guys) but by listening to this album it made me appreciate some of the songs from SAJ.      I'm a big fan of 80s music and after listening to such tracks like \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" and \\"Not Falling Apart\\" it put a HUGE smile on my face!  \\"Kiwi\\" really reminds me of Prince and a bit of Earth, Wind and Fire which makes me love the funkiness of the track.  I can easily listen to every track except for one (I get a little creeped out that he calls his love \\"little girl\\").    This is a CD that will stay in my player for a long, long time.  Again, I'm glad they reinvented themselves.  For anyone who wasn't impressed by the first album, listen to it again 'cause for some reason this album puts it in a different light.
B000002LCK|5.0|\\"The Perfect Kiss\\", the only kiss that keeps on giving. This song appears on several CD's in several versions, I prefer Low-Life. Unfortunately, this song is not about a kiss; I would like to think it is. A perfect kiss, like one of those zingers that electrifies you all the way down to your toes and back; we've all had them. That is what New Order does with this song.By the way, what's up with the frogs? Check it out.
0316018953|2.0|As others have pointed out, this is a very disappointing novel. It's too short, it's boring, and nothing like Connelly's earlier novels. (No Bosch to sink your teeth into.) The same thing happened to Patricia Cornwell.  I don't buy her books any more and in the future, I'm going to check out other reviewers before buying another one of Connelly's. What happened? Connelly used to be the best . . .  I advise anyone new to the series to skip this, and read the earlier Bosch novels.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I hated Spider-Man 2 for the simple reason that it had way, way too much of Peter Parker whining about how screwed up his life was. It didn't show enough of how his life was being screwed up.    First rule of movie making - Show, don't tell. It's a visual medium for crying out loud. Plus numerous continuity errors (Pete doesn't have enough money to go see MJ perform so she gives him tickets. He gets kicked out but later goes to see her anyway... so how did he get the money for those tickets?) drag down Spider-Man 2.    Spider-Man 3 fixes all the problems I had with Spider-Man 2.

0739441671|4.0|NOT AS GOOD AS DAVINCI CODE OR ANGELS AND DEAMONS BUT IT WAS A GOOD STORY ABOUT \\"BIG BROTHER\\" THE GOVERNMENT WATCHING YOU THROUGH YOUR COMPUTER.

B00006ADFL|5.0|The true-life tale told in Peter Jackson's often deceptively meandering Heavenly Creatures is one of lurid murder, and it possesses the ability to make a viewer recoil, not only because of the identity of the victim in the particularly heinous and cold blooded crime, but because of the identity of the killers. When I was in Christchurch, New Zealand this year, I happened to mention the Parker-Hulme murder, and the reactions I received from people my own age and younger showed that even fifty-three years after they occurred, the case still holds power over the collective memory of that normally peaceful nation. When I came home I watched Heavenly Creatures for the first time since high school, and found it probably even more troubling than I did years ago.<br /><br />Before he was better known in the United States for making The Lord of the Rings, New Zealand native Peter Jackson shot this fantasy-heavy version of a killing he'd grown up hearing so much about. He cast Kate Winslett and Melanie Lynskey as Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker, two slightly off-center girls whose unusual detachment from reality and somewhat disordered species of lesbianism set up a disturbing background for their premeditated crime. While the concept of adolescents who kill family members is less novel to us today than it was generations back, to enter into the minds and secret lives of Pauline and Juliet still makes for a unique sort of head trip. I also found the realization that Jackson shot nearly all of Heavenly Creatures on the actual sites of the events depicted generates a peculiar frisson in me every time I settle in to watch it. Jackson shot the tea shop scene in the actual restaurant in which Mrs. Parker had her last meal moments before her slaying, and as rumor has it, was set to shoot the death segment literally atop the actual ground on which the murder took place, but felt there was something too troubling in the act, so he re-located a short space away. In my opinion it's little details like these that only add to the creepy quality of Heavenly Creatures.<br /><br />In a side note, Juliet Hulme went on in later life to become a best selling novelist---of murder/detective fiction, no less---and is still writing today under the pen name of Anne Perry.ails like these that only add to the creepy quality of Heavenly Creatures.

0393327345|5.0|The movie, amazing;<br />the book, a masterpiece;<br />after reading the book, you see what the movie was trying to do,<br />granted i think the movie did a good job, but the book was amazing, there's so much more detail, it has more of the love story element that the movie left out, it's has so much more of a grunge feel and it really makes you think;<br />it ends differently than the movie, and i'm not sure which ending i like better, but i love them both.<br /><br />if you're a Chuck fan or a Fight Club fan, get this book.<br />s'all i have to say

B00000K19E|1.0|I believe that if someone like Tom Cruise or Denzel Washington was the star then this would have been more compelling but Keanu Reeves is such a horrible actor and so painful to watch that it killed this movie for me.      Following it was difficult.  The concept was good and Laurence Fishburne was fantastic but Reeves was as bad as he always is.  Why does this man continue to get work...???
B000000OEI|5.0|This is actually the first soundtrack that triggered my love for soundtracks. It introduced me to Hans Zimmer, my favorite music composer of all time. It all started with Crimson Tide.  While I don't recall ever understanding the movie at the time, (gimme a break; I was much younger!) I remember that music and how much it stood out for me.  It was an adventure all its own and yet, at the same time, truly brought to life the movie itself.  Crimson Tide, in my opinion, wouldn't have been as enjoyable if it wasn't for the tremendous and awesome efforts of Hans Zimmer's brilliant composure of such a hard-working orchestra/band. \\"Roll Tide\\" is particularly catchy as it gradually builds up to an almost victorious and thunderous sound, impossible to not get yourself amped up when you hear it. But that main theme, which has its alternate versions sprinkled throughout the tracks, is what made my love of movie scores possible.  I am forever hooked.
0743496728|5.0|This book was very exciting. Although it was fiction, it seemed  very realistic at times.  It was hard to put down.
B000OMD4BG|4.0|This is a collection of Elliott Smith recordings that never made it into a number of his past records.  The quality of sound on mostly all of the tracks are done well.  Anyone who is new to Elliott Smith should pick up this album, as it gives a taste of Elliott over the years.  But if you want to see his real shining points, check out his XO and Either/Or cd's.
0061191981|5.0|This books Rocks!!! I don't usually have time to read books or magazines due to my busy schedule but I make time for this book. If you like Mr. Ramsay on Hell's Kitchen, You will love this book!!!
B000FVQYYK|3.0|They're good songwriters, good musicians, and yeah the guy's a good singer albeit Thom Yorke will always be better...    The problem with this album is it's production. Way overproduced to the point that half of the backing voices are completely superfluous and in many cases, cheesy.    If you're sensitive to production taste, be cautious with this one.
B00005KB9T|5.0|IMHO the Wailers (in all incarnations) never made a bad album, but they did make a couple that weren't quite up to snuff. However, this one has everything you could want from a 70's roots reggae band. \\"Concrete Jungle\\" with its haunting intro, \\"Stop That Train\\" with its universal message of dissatisfaction, the classic lovers anthem \\"Stir It Up\\", and the call for unity that is \\"No More Trouble\\" are just a handful of the killer tracks on this album. Honestly, I can't even think of a song on Catch a Fire that I don't love.
B0002BO0AS|3.0|Of Unearth's three albums, this is probably their worst, though its not bad. Stings of Conscience is a great, raw hardcore sound, III: in the Eyes of Fire is refined, superfast european death/american metalcore hybrid. This album? the least fast, least heavy, and least effective.    There are moments that are great, true, but more moments where it gets kinda boring: not quite heavy but no real effort at something melodic. In that way it resembles nu-metal, though this band is way more talented, and sometimes on this disc, it shows.    Problem is #1) they sound way better before and after this one, and #2) most other metalcore bands sound like this.    Long story short, get their other albums.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a movie that I came upon from the critics on TV (you know, two names of two guys that have a lot to say). Well, I was glad that they did. This movie had me fall in love with all the characters in the story line and then also in the story line too. I enjoyed both the male and female roles and this is usually not the case for me. The name \\"Serenity\\" is the name of the spaceship that finds itself home for everyone. The way that the spaceship looked and was laid out was great to look at. The plot lines of the movie was great and I suggest you see the TV shows first (named \\"Firefly\\" after the type of spaceship that Serenity is designed as). The TV shows will give you a lot of insight on the characters and how they interact and this makes the movie much more enjoyable. I purchased both the seasons for Firefly and the movie; something I rarely do. I feel that there is so much good stuff out there why would I want to take up the time watching something more that at least twice. But I know that I will watch all of these many more times that two as I have a not so secret crush on the main character, Mal. Hope everyone out there enjoys this movie as much as I do.

1582701709|1.0|Lots of other folks say it far better than me but what a crock.  C'mon people, there's no free lunch.  People don't think themselves sick with cancer or to die in Rwanda or Darfur or Iraq or to starve in Bangladesh or to win the lottery or invent the iPod ... [insert your thought here]. People are successful because they work hard, have a good attitude and, yes, a little luck never hurts.  They are not successful simply because they wished it so.
B000JCETC4|5.0|The funny thing about 'old rockers', they have perpective. Mr. Gilmour's Take Breathe is more that a breathe of fresh air, but giving life of rebirth. Here is a guy who was involved in one of greatest rock albums ever recorded, it was nominated for a grammy, only to lose to Bridge of Troubled Water back when. Politics, ya know. Can play any type of guitar style and he comes out with new gems. Technology has caught up with Gilmour but he is using it. This is an amazing piece of music! Anyone who is ever thinking about learning guitar, should listen to this.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|For all those freaking out about the cost its not that big of a deal.  By the time it is released it'll probably go down another $20 or so.<br /><br />With that said I've watched a couple of these episodes via Xbox Live, and I have to say they are really fun to watch.  The remastery and added special effects make rewatching the 40 year old episodes very enjoyable.<br /><br />Being on HD-DVD this series is going to be incredible because of the \\"In-Movie Experience\\", the online features are going to be really cool, which these fantastic features aren't available on Blu-Ray (which is one of the biggest reasons Paramount went with just HD-DVD).  With the VC-1 coding and the incredible HD sound, this is the ultimate HD/Star Trek fan package.<br /><br />I'm getting it and I'm sure hundreds of thousands will be too.
1932100660|5.0|The data contained in this book scares me!  If this is REAL, then we need to be as serious about our diets as we are about tobacco and other carcinogens.    Hey, I don't have time to investigate nutritional studies, and I couldn't interpret the data even if I did.  But, this book does a great job of summarizing The China Study and some other very good studies done by unbiased and top-notch scientists, (and even I could understand it!)  I'm convinced.  I'm changing the way I eat.    Don't listen to anyone else; you just need to read this book and decide for yourself.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|If I could give 6 stars I would, and I've never said that before. Love this show. LOVE IT! (Pissy at showtime but that's just because they don't let people - even US people serving their country - outside the US look at stuff on their website, but their product is awesome... )<br /><br />Ok, so Dexter, he's a little different, right? He works for the police, he's charming and geeky, he kills people for fun after work. Just bad people, of course. It would be no fun otherwise...<br /><br />This is a strange story - more than half revenge fantasy but also part personal growth drama, part romance, lots of humor, and some good old fashioned thriller thrown in for spice. It makes you ache a little inside and then giggle in horror. It invokes a lot of emotion in it's viewers, as you watch someone without emotion begin to feel things and not know what's going on...  not understand that these are feelings he's having. I'm sure a lot of people are pursing their lips over it and going \\"tsk!\\". I mean, a comedy/drama where the hero is a sociopathic serial killer? And a very good one at that?<br /><br />The acting is AMAZING. This is TV done right, TV that makes you sing with delight, that catches you with it's beauty and writing and the way it perfectly catches the atmosphere of a place. I cannot rave enough - it goes in with the other perfect shows like the new Battlestar Galactica (somewhat less funny but just as perfect) and Wire in the Blood, Buffy, Firefly and Touching Evil. It's vastly better than CSI Miami (really, what isn't?) but it will draw comparisons, or parallels, because both take place in Miami and involve forensics (from weirdly skewed angles mentally, when you look at it - he's both catching killers forensically and keeping from being caught himself...)  This show catchs the flavor of Miami in such a lovely way that you want to visit, even if - like me - you absolutely hate humid heat and bugs and all that sort of crap. It makes it seem alive and vibrant, dead hookers and all...<br /><br />Can't wait for season 2. Can't wait can't wait... couldn't wait for this season either but man oh man, now I know exactly how good it is? Yes!Can't wait for season 2. Can't wait can't wait... couldn't wait for this season either but man oh man, now I know exactly how good it is? Yes!

B00005JPLW|4.0|What a fabulous motion picture - I can't get over how realistic it was - especially the dental work.  Those early Spartans were brave souls, yes they were.  I can see it now....King Leonidas lowering his beefy frame into the dentist's chair...the dentist puts a vacuum tube in the King's mouth to suck up the spit and asks the King if he wants novocaine....Leonidas rears up and roars through his spittle, \\"THISHSH ISSHHH SHPARTAAAHHH!!!!\\"     And that's not all the brave Spartans from this film underwent to tell us this tale of courage.  They were waxed, too, and I can tell you, folks, waxing hurts.  In my reckless youth, I spent a few consenting adult moments with gentlemen of the Greek persuasion, and they are a hirsute race, I guarantee you.  But not these Spartans, no siree.....not a one of them went before the camera with a spot of hair on his body. 300 full-body wax jobs....now that is truly brave.      I saw this movie in the theatre and then rented it to watch again at home.  Why?  Well, to admire the fabulous visuals, of course.  Amazing dentistry, waxed and muscular physiques, what more could you ask for in an evening's entertainment?  Just one thing....a tummy f**t.  You know the kind...when you make your kid brother or sister scream by pulling up his shirt and planting your lips on his tummy and blowing?  Ah, yes...a wonderful tummy f**t.  Well, this movie is a dream come true for anyone who has ever taken joy in a tummy f**t.  From beginning to end, a stream of torsos, just begging to be blown against parade themselves before your very eyes. Big-time fantasy material.   A real eye-popper.    This movie rates five stars for the graphic-novel visuals, two stars for the plot and acting, which evens out to three stars.  A bonus star for the dental work and torsos brings it up to four stars.  Enjoy!

B000RJO578|5.0|Once again Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost have cast their brilliance on a genre to create a film that is truly genre defying in of itself, as a comedy it excels, and as an action film it also excels, it is a bit of horror/thriller as well for reasons I won't disclose, and a pinch of mystery to boot! If you liked Shaun of the Dead, buy this movie now. Only drawback - Not availible on Blu-Ray.
B000I9U9A4|4.0|This was an engrossing film for several reasons - the portrayal of ocean-going shipboard life and related scenery was totally realistic; the characters were 3-dimensional (interesting and realistic), and the resolution of the main pursuit drama against bad odds was believable and satisying -(the surviving good guys beat the \\"Crepauds\\" (French) marauders in a good blood-and-guts classic sea fight. Commendably realistic in setting and drama, vs. Errol Flynn and celuloid crew a half-century ago. Worth watching.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I'm not a big fan of theatre or anything, but I like movies that are truly geniune, and lemme tell ya this movie is a good as it gets as far as Hamlet adaptations are concerned, in part because it isnt an adaptation per say, it is in fact the entire play unabridged in its entirety. Kenneth Branagh does an incredible performance along with the very seriously all star cast.

B000QFCD2W|4.0|It's hard to believe that four years have already passed since the decent Puppet Master album. Now the King is back with one of his best efforts ever! GMYSP is full of great riffs, solos, and vocal melodies. Most of the songs are mid-tempo which is the way I like it, not too fast and not too slow. Also, KD uses his falsetto sparingly and tastefully, and the double bass drums are kept in check. I've never been a fan of constant power metal double bass drums. One thing that really impressed me with GMYSP is Mike Wead's lead playing. La Rocque's playing is great as usual but Mike's solos are very melodic and interesting. The story is not so scary but it provides another good vehicle for a King Diamond album. I think I will get into this album more and more each day. For the time being I give it an almost perfect 4.5 stars!!!!
B000SO7OMA|5.0|This DVD/CD set was made from Loreena McKennitt's concert footage during performances in Alhambra, Spain.  The setting is beautiful, acoustics outstanding, and performance by both Loreena and her fellow musicians positively magnificent.  Every song is a gem, and the performances are flawless.  The quality of recording is fantastic for a live concert.  The DVD concert is a delight to watch, and the two CDs contain all of the music from the DVD.  The length of the concert is about 90 minutes, which is a very generous performance from any modern performer.<br /><br />This is a must-have for any Loreena McKennitt fan.  It is well worth the money spent.
0970802226|5.0|The Hound of the Baskervilles was assigned as a high school summer reading selection.  We ordered the book on CD, which made the assignment somewhat entertaining and more easily accomplished given the length and tone of the book.  The book itself is, of course, a \\"classic\\" Sherlock Holmes murder mystery.  However, by todays standards, the mystery is rather tame and, in my opinion, the writing style is cumbersome for young people.  The CD is delightfuly read/performed and I highly recommend the CD vs. the written text.
B000AARKOO|5.0|It is not often that I do come across a movie that deals with my favorite point in history (the Dark Ages to the Middle Ages). I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.

B00005JPHT|4.0|I am a physician from Germany and have watched the movie. I liked the plot, although the movie wasn't as witty as 9/11.<br /><br />The US-healthcare system is way too expensive. When our son was treated for a night at a hospital for some respiratory distress, we received a bill over 1500 U$. In Germany - with the same high standard of care - we would have had to pay approximately 300 U$. A colleague of mine had been hospitalized in an intensive care unit in the U$ for 3 days. He had to pay 25000 U$ for a couple of procedures. In Germany, the price would have been appr. 4000 U$.<br />And the European systems, e. g. France or Germany are really good and very comparable to the success rates achieved in the US.<br /><br />HOWEVER, in the movie SICKO, it is criticized that a (black) patient was turned down for a allogeneic transplant for a metastatic renal carcinoma. The treatment is not evidence based for renal cell cancer and usually does not lead to cure. It was mentioned that the review panel was just without heart to turn him down. However, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is not a standard treatment for this disease.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is a showtime series starring Michael C Hall.  The first season is roughly the same as the book Darkly Dreaming Dexter.  I'd call it a black comedy.

0440241413|3.0|I love, love, love Bridget Jones. I'll pick up either of those books and reread favorite parts when I need a laugh, I've bought them as gifts, etc. So I thought that I'd love this, too. I know I'm in late in the game on this author/series, but I just had never picked it up.<br /><br />In some ways I should love this, because it is SO like Bridget - too much so, in my opinion. I know Bridget's based on Pride & Prejudice, and any story can be, but it seems like there are an awful lot of similarities in these two books. The rich, aloof man who might be nice, the publishing heroine who's a little daft, the money issues... Part of me felt like saying, \\"Hey, get your own ideas.\\" And no, they are not exactly the same, but...<br /><br />At any rate, I can't quite figure out why I DIDN'T love this book. I think the problem is that I felt Becky to be a little more mean-spirited with her daftness, or a little more just plain dumb than dizzy, or something. At any rate, I just didn't love Becky, the heroine, making it fairly difficult, then, to love the book.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just too fond of Bridget and my view of this as a knock-off has colored my opinion - if I'd not read Helen Fielding's novels I might have liked this more. I really don't know. I know there are more installments, and I can't decide if I'm going to try another one or not.
0375423966|4.0|I read these books consecutively - having bought them as a box set - and I really enjoyed them. It gives us a genuinely intimate portrait of what life was like growing up in Iran, first under the Shah's right-wing dictatorship, then during the Islamic revolution which led to a clerical state and through the war with Iraq. The two-part memoir takes us from 1980 when Marjane was 10 years old through the 1990s when she's become a woman who had endured exile at a young age and a return to her country.<br /><br />Because these are illustrated novels there isn't as much depth as there would be in a traditional novel. The characters aren't fleshed out in the narrative because we have the visual element available. And the visual element is wonderful. Through the relatively simple drawings the fear, turmoil, frustration and even humor of Marjane and her friends and family are easily identified and enrich the story tremendously.<br /><br />At first I had a problem with the writing style - with the direct and simple prose. However, the more I read the more I became comfortable with the style, pacing and rhythm.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend that these books be read together as a valuable introduction an overview of the history and traditions of Iran, as well as for the wonderful story of a little girl growing up in an impossibly complex and frightening environment.
1592289444|4.0|There is some debate as to whether or not this story is true, but it is not at all improbable. Sentenced to 25 years in the Soviet gulag system, Polish cavalry-officer Rawicz was determined to escape from the remote Siberian labor-camp, somewhere north of Lake Baikal. The brutality Rawicz experienced at the hands of the communist government is typical of such accounts from this era. It reminds one of the memoirs of Alexander Solzhenitzyn.   Rawicz assembled a group of six other prisoners: two more Polish soldiers, a Latvian, a Lithuanian, a Yugoslavian, and ...an American! They made their break in early 1941, during a winter storm. Along the way, a teenage Polish girl also joined the party. The resulting narrative (if it is all true) is a harsh tale of survival as they trekked across some of the most rugged and dangerous terrain on Earth: frozen pine-forests, open plains, the Gobi Desert, and the mountains of Tibet.  Sadly, only half the party made it to the objective, which was India. Had they been less hasty in their trek once free of Soviet territory, the entire party could have survived. Had they planned more, traveled with caravans, and learned some basic survival skills, they could have brought everyone out.   The crossed Siberia, Mongolia, north China, and Tibet, cut off from all civilization and news of events abroad. They passed through lands where life was largely unchanged in a thousand years, and oblivious to the titanic events of World War II. Had Rawicz's party stopped in Lhasa, they surely would have met the famed mountaineers Heinrich Harrer and Peter Aufschneider (read \\"Seven Years In Tibet\\").   The most sceptical account, is a sighting of the \\"Yeti\\", while in the Himalayas. Did they really see some as yet unclassified primate? Who is to say?  Regardless, the story is profoundly fascinating...I hope its all true! The only improvement to the tale: what happened to the survivors after they left India? Unfortunately, thats where the story ends.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I watched most of these episodes on public TV 30 years ago, and many of the interviews and footage were still vivid in my mind.  Watching again makes me appreciate the brilliant job done by all concerned.      The documentary was made at precisely the right time in history -- when the war was distant enough for some perspective, but not so distant that the witnesses were dead.  This work is the gold standard for documentaries.    The opening and end of the series keys on a massacre in France done by retreating Germans who were themselves killed a few hours or days later.  The footage of the wrecked town preserved as a monument and Olivier's narration are pure artistry.      Visually, the most unforgettable clips are from the air battles and bombing runs.  Emotionally, I was most struck by interviews of German and Dutch citizens dealing with the guilt from being forced to collaborate on some level.      The Holocaust is dealt with in one episode, which is structured perfectly to start with the Nazi racial theories, leading to wrenching interviews with survivors, and ending with the most affecting clip of the whole series (bulldozing the dead at a concentration camp).  The subject probably should have been done, however, in two or three episodes.  The bonus DVDs correct this by including two large segments with more survivor interviews and incredible use of German propaganda footage.     An entire episode is devoted to the atomic bomb and is extraordinarily well done.  It does tend toward favoring the European perspective that dropping the bomb was unnecessary, though it includes interviews making the contrary case.  I tend to agree that the bomb did not have to be dropped.  But the editors miss the point -- after 6 years of total war, the world was so brutalized that no one was going to hesitate to use any weapon that could conceivably advance the war to any measurable degree.  The editors miss the point that it was only after the bomb was dropped that even people like Truman started having second thoughts about all the dead children -- and the world, over the years, started coming to terms with the reality of total war in the nuclear age.    Not enough time is devoted to the war in Russia, which was the most determinative of the war's outcome and where most of the people died.      A lot of the bonus material is just extra footage spliced in with what you've already seen in the previous episodes.  But the Holocaust segment in the bonus material does add to and improve the overall work.    This is a classic that is worth the time and money.
6305736650|3.0|I was very excited when i first watched this movie because it is almost on top of lists of all-time greatest movies and the reviews are like wow.. this must be really one of the best! After watching it, I was kinda disappointed because I think the story is so-so, there is no chemistry between the two lead cast (but Bergman is very lovely though). I don't know what's so special about this movie. Did I miss it or what?
B0007TFCFW|5.0|I am amazed that as far ahead in time as this moment early september 2007 that this master still completely blows my mind. It is truly ingenious that Ian came up with this \\"Mother of all concept albums\\" Im old and grey but i just dont get todays music just like my parents would of never gotten \\"thick\\" all they got was Nixon!<br />  Not only is this the mother os all concept albums but this is the mother of all things thinking and intelligent, yes music should make you think! Unlike todays kids who are just stupid and commercial. But tull peaked with new drummer Barrie Barlow and old school mates were completely reunited from the John Evans Smash!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000QQFKYE|4.0|Writer and director David Lynch has earned many film awards, but he asks a lot of his viewers. Five minutes into this film life-sized rabbits appear in a living room dressed in suits and ties. Prostitutes dance the 60's Locomotion. This film also lasts three hours, and has no linear plot. Time morphs back and forth between past, present and future. Place moves between Poland and Hollywood. Lynch is either coy or just brutally honest when the only description he will give of INLAND EMPIRE (he insists that the title be capitalized) is that it's about \\"a woman in trouble.\\" Other than that, many viewers compare the film to human dreaming or the interior landscape of human consciousness -- disjointed, disassociative, vivid, scary, and sometimes an unrelated stream of consciousness. Laura Dern's performance alone makes the film worth watching; she plays three roles. As a movie about a film and the actress who stars in it, there's the sense that reality is a social construction that depends upon the viewer, and not something objective with a fixed meaning. Lynch shot the film with an off-the-rack Sony digital camera, and as with his other films the soundtrack is alternately ominous, eery, and quirky. Lynch fans will rave at this film, while the average movie goer will just scratch her head.
B00005M989|5.0|Great product. Came on time.
B00011D1OA|5.0|Such a delightful film! This is probably one of Audrey's best performance! It's just so disappointing that she wasn't even nominated for the Oscar! Huh! I feel bad for her!
B00005JKES|5.0|I don't care if people don't like this but, DON'T BUY THIS DVD SET!!! A BRAND NEW SET WITH BOTH SEASONS IS COMING OUT OCT 30,2007. It includes both seasons of twin peaks,the pilot episode plus an extras disk. The picture has also been redone to look much better and the sound has also been remastered. Don't take this the wrong way I'm a huge Lynch fan and I just don't want people to waste their money on this if they want the whole series. If you don't want all the episodes then by all means by this thing it's the only way you can get the first season on it's own. By the way if you want the new edition of both seasons w/ all the bells and whistles you want the \\"TWIN PEAKS GOLD EDITION\\" thats the newest edition. thanks for reading my review.
B00000E0YH|4.0|Forgot all about this neo-progressive metal band as I haven't seen any of their material for several years now. This self-titled CD was the 1986 debut as I saw them play a club a few years later. Crimson Glory was a metal band that had plenty to offer it's fans. Tracks here that had me sit up and take notice were \\"Valhalla\\", the headbanging \\"Dragon Lady\\", \\"Queen Of The Masquerade\\" and the anthem {sort to speak} \\"Angels of War\\". Line-up: Midnight-vocals, Jon Drenning & Ben Jackson-guitars, Jeff Lords-bass and Dana Burnell-drums. Should appeal to fans of Queensryche {duh!}, Fates Warning, Yngwie Malmsteen. Give it a listen.

B000AP04MO|5.0|An unconventional portrayal of the life of a married couple Joanna and Mark Wallace, this movie gives us a glimpse of what \\"being married\\" is all about. One of Audrey's greatest performance, TFTR is one of the most underrated movies in Hollywood. The music of Henry Mancini adds to the charm of the film together with the meticulous direction of Stanley Donen.     Highly recommended!
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Obviously the Amazon reviewer was hoping for a new MOTLEY CRUE disk.It's not and that's a good thing.   The irony of The Heroin Diaries is the fact that it is about addiction and I am now addicted to the disk! Looking forward to the book.  Great work, great story, something different (record labels be damned), must listen.  Get it.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I marginally liked this film when I first rented it, but somehow it resinated with me, and I recently bought it.  I didn't even know it was based on a video game.  I thought the cinematography was fantastic, and the score was mesmorizing and haunting.  The whole film plays out like a mystical dream or a bad nightmare, that all depends upon your style.  The special effects are fantastic, it puts you in that demon world.  Radha Mitchell is one of those obscure actresses. She also plays in \\"High Art\\", which is another fantastic film.  Hopefully there will be another \\"Silent Hill\\", the script leaves more to the imagination.
B000RJO578|4.0|My only gripe is that it goes on a tad too long; however, the movie is very funny. Some of the gags are subtle. It reminds of a \\"Fawlty Towers\\" script. Some of the gags don't really come into fruitition until the end of the movie. The good cops were likeable characters and the villians were funny. The plot made no sense really, but it flowed pretty well and the laughs kept on coming so that I didn't care. Timothy Dalton was very good at being obviously evil and smarmy. Edward Woodward was good to see as well.  Broadbent and Cranham played off each really well in sort of a Laurel and Hardy team. The actors took the movie fairly seriously so that added to the charm as well.     The movie is laugh out loud funny in spots.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I have watched this movie at least a dozen times and it still never fails to enchant me. This may not be the best love movie of all but it is definitely one of the greatest and most enduring!     Audrey really looked fresh on the screen, Roman Holiday being her debut American film. Gregory Peck was really good as the newspaper guy contrary to what others think that he was a miscast. Regarding the ending, I admit I was really upset when I first watched it, but then I thought it was really the perfect ending. I would not have loved it so otherwise.    I recommend this to everyone who loves classic love stories and realistic endings!
B00004W221|5.0|\\"Rudy\\" is one of the those special films that comes along which can truly change people's lives through its inspiration, and its power to live your dreams no matter the obstacles that are placed before you.  In a great sense, it is a power of the American dream, that anyone, when given the opportunity, can fulfill their dreams and ambitions.  Everyone who lives in this country, and everyone who has ideas and notions of the United States, understands that the American dream is about being given the opportunity.<br /><br />\\"Rudy\\" is one of the greatest sports films ever made.  The film was put together by the same team that gave us \\"Hoosiers\\" several years earlier.  It's obvious that they love stories about the underdog, and Rudy Ruettiger certainly falls into that category.  Some of the best films made are underdog stories.  \\"Rocky\\" is one of the best.  However, what makes \\"Rudy\\" and \\"Hoosiers\\" special is that they are based on real people and events.<br /><br />Rudy Ruettiger is a young man who has but one dream that he has had since he was a small boy: to be a Notre Dame football player.  No one thinks he can do it.  Not even his own family believes that he is capable of fulfilling this larger than life ambition.  \\"Notre Dame is for rich kids.  It's not for us,\\" says his father.  \\"Don't waste your life chasing a stupid dream.\\"  This is the attitude of virtually everyone around Rudy.  He's not especially big or even athletic, but he's got what most other players lack: heart.  He is able to win over the coaches and teammates with his grit, determination, and unyielding desire to do everything it takes to make the Notre Dame team the best in the country, even if it means taking a beating every day during practice.<br /><br />Fulfilling dreams is often a difficult and even daunting task.  First, Rudy must get accepted into the university of Notre Dame.  He's over at Holy Cross eagerly picking up his mail to see if he has been accepted.  This isn't as easy as it seems as he is rejected one semester after another.  Sean Astin gives the performance of his life in this film.  He's able to make the audience share in his frustrations and doubts, while picking us up with his enthusiasm and over-zealous behavior regarding the football team.<br /><br />Rudy's next hurtle is to make the football team.  This is no easy task either as he has to make sure to give 110% just to make sure that the coaches see that he won't give up.<br /><br />Finally, Rudy's next obstacle, and perhaps his biggest, is to find a way to dress for one game so that he can officially be recognized as a member of the Notre Dame football team.  After all, this is his truest desire; to play in a game.  The other accomplishments are merely steps toward this ultimate goal.<br /><br />Anyone with a beating heart can't help but feel moved and inspired during the last few minutes of the film when Rudy is finally able to take the field.  The dreams of nearly twenty-four years are felt in that final moment as they are finally fulfilled, and the story and events leading us to this point make it all the more powerful.  But, you cannot appreciate the destination without appreciating the journey.  Rudy's story would not be half as inspired if we weren't given access to the obstacles that he had to face and overcome.  As many have said, it is in the journey.<br /><br />I must mention the wonderful music of Jerry Goldsmith.  It adds such a dimension to this film, that I'm sure you'll hear it playing over and over in your head long after the movie is over.  The drums that he has beating throughout the soundtrack seem to beat with the same determination that Rudy has; as if he is grinding out each and every day, struggling to overcome each and every obstacle.<br /><br />it is simply fantastic that stories like these are brought to light, whether it be through television, books, or movies.  This is a film for the entire family to enjoy.  All of us, at some time or another, need to be reminded that if we have a dream, we should never, ever give up until we fulfill it.  This movie is a powerful testament to all who dream, and to all who wish to accomplish their dream.ive up until we fulfill it.  This movie is a powerful testament to all who dream, and to all who wish to accomplish their dream.
B000OCZ80Q|5.0|[[ASIN:B000OCZ80Q Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake / Nureyev, Letestu, Martinez, Paris Opera Ballet [HD DVD]]]Since purchasing both a HD DVD and a Blu-Ray player, we have been wondering why there isn't much of a selection for the classical performing arts. Surround sound and high-def picture both lend themselves perfectly to programming such as Ballet, Opera, and Theatre. Swan Lake was the first offering we saw and ordered it immediately. We were not disappointed. The surround sound provided center seating acoustics as well as the live performance sound of the dancer's feet upon the stage......very live performance type of experience. The high-def picture was flawless and provided a depth that gave the impression of a bird's eye view of a live performance. Equipment used Toshiba HD-XA2 HD DVD player; Denon AVR-4806ci receiver; Polk 7.1 speakers; HP MD5880N high-def TV. All connected via HDMI.

B000GTLQXU|2.0|Indeed, who better to helm a mega budget, CGI heavy remake of the Poseidon Adventure than Wolfgang Petersen?  The director of Troy, Das Boot, and The Perfect Storm re-works the 70's classic with some incredible tools at his disposal, as well as a potential-laced cast (Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfus, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barret, Andre Braugher, Freddy Rodriguez, and Kevin Dillon), but alas, Poseidon ends up being the mega budget, mainstream, brainless, disaster flick that you probably think it is.  The script does absolutely nothing to make the viewer feel any kind of sympathy or attachment to the characters, let alone care what happens to any of them as they all fight to survive when the state of the art, luxury ship capsizes after being hit by a massive wave.  Despite the incredible looking CGI effects and some great, old fashioned stunt work, Poseidon ultimately falls flat in the department that could have made it something truly special: character development.  It's not incredibly bad by any means, and definitely worth seeing for rainy day or brainless entertainment, but in any other case besides, you won't miss anything if you never see Poseidon.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I enjoyed the first two Harry Potter movies that Chris Columbus directed, but this movie blew those two out of the water completely. Director Alfonso Cuaron transformed the entire series with this movie, making it darker, more artistic, and overall a better movie-watching experience than the other Potter films. A lot of fans are annoyed because of all the differences between the movie and the book, but I think the changes were done in a manner that truly makes Prisoner of Azkaban the best film out of the 5 we've seen so far.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I had not read Pride & Prejudice before watching the movie.  I had tried many times but I always ended up putting it down.  After seeing the movie (many, many times) I could not get enough of the story...and Mr. Darcy.  I picked up the book again and read it straight through -- twice.  It is a love story that all women (and men) should see (and read).

B00005JKED|4.0|Training day is a decent movie but Denzel Washington's character Alonzo is what keeps us captivated.  He plays the type of character that if you just had the  television on while you were doing things and Training Day happened to be on and you had never seen it you'd slowly find yourself drawn to the t.v and keep watching as his character grabs you.  I just watched it the other night and I remembered his character having all these cool lines like Samuel L. Jackson's character did in Pulp Fiction from my first viewing but not so much, granted there are some cool lines but it is Washington's delivery of those lines that make them seem so cool, almost like  how comedians say it's all about timing.    Other movie characters that come to mind that I feel there character out shined the movie are Kathy Bates in Misery and Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher in Scorsese's Gangs of New York.  I would also mention Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lecter from Silence of the Lambs but that film is great all around as it showed at Oscar time and matches Hopkins performance.  Each of these characters I mention had strong supporting actors to enhance there performance like a dancing partner who is always there to catch and support the other partner.  Kathy Bates had James Caan and Daniel Day Lewis had Leonardo DiCaprio now Denzel Washington gets his support from Ethan Hawke, who did not get an Oscar win as Washington Deservedly did for his role of Alonzo but did get an Oscar nomination.      With 493 reviews of this movie at the time I'm writing this and a good plot synopsis from Amazon there really is no reason to go into any plot detail, just wanted to point out A great movie character made by Denzel Washington and the reason this is a must see for his performance alone.    DVD  The picture and sound quality of this movie were great, I watched The Good Shepard on HD-DVD after this and Training Day on regular dvd looked possibly more impressive.  So if you have blu ray or hd dvd playerand like and have this film and are thinking of upgrading I wouldn't bother.    DVD SPECIAL FEATURES: (from back of the dvd)  -Behind the scenes documentary hbo first look: The making of Training Day.    -Feature length audio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua.  -Additional Scenes.  -Alternate ending (it is pretty interesting giving a little bit more to Jakes day)  -2 Music Videos (music from the movie is good if you like hip hop/rap) Nelly's #1 and Pharoahe Monch's Got you  -Interactive menus  -Theatrical Trailer.

B000FQJAIM|5.0|Finally a DVD where Han shoots first and there are no unnecessary effects from the special edition. I am so thrilled that the original theatrical release is on this DVD. If you're a fan of the originals, buy this DVD before George Lucas goes crazy again and decides to pull the originals out of print.
B000F9RB8A|4.0|I love this movie, but it doesn't seem like it looks significantly better than it did on DVD. Worth having if you don't already own it on DVD.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Trashcanman, you said it perfectly. Everyone blew it. If I remember correctly, America decided that they would rather see. Are We Done Yet. I saw Grindhouse three times in the theater and have no problem buying both movies seperately. The double feature was meant for theaters. God for bid that anyone sit in a theater for over 3 hours anymore!! Stop Bitching. I'm sure they will release another version if these sell well.
0446364495|3.0|It seemed for a short period every woman in America was fantasizing over \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\". I felt that any book that could stimulate the libido of the American female so drastically must, of necessity, reveal same penetrating insights. So I read the book.<br /><br />It seems that a rather boring, unimaginative woman, who has lost contact with her loyal, faithful, dutiful husband, decides to have a fling with a traveling `salesman' while her poor husband is off to the 4-H Club fair with the kids.<br /><br />So she bangs this traveling salesman (who is posing as a photographer for National Geographic - Yeah, National Inquirer, most likely; or more than likely unemployed) upstairs, in the bed of her and her loyal, faithful husband while he and THEIR children are out of sight for ONE damn day.<br /><br />Well, obviously being a woman of very, very low sexual enthusiasm and appetite, and IMAGINATION this one afternoon fling with some bozo walking by with a knapsack on his back satisfies her for the rest of her life. Not only does it satisfy her for the rest of her life, she fantasizes over the event, to such a neurotic extent that she even writes a letter to her children detailing the episode, for them to read after \\"she's gone\\".<br /><br />In the letter she explains to her children (probably while the old man is sitting on the trunk in the attic next to his kids) that she banged this traveling salesman in the same bed where they were conceived, because their `Daddy'(the man who bought the bed and was paying the mortgage on the building where the bed was being violated), the same man who had taught them to whittle a stick, catch a ball, and spit, was so boring and such a total drag in the bedroom that one hump with a strange hobo has made it possible for her to endure the rest of her entire life with their lump of a father.<br /><br />They actually made a movie of this book staring Clint Eastward, and some female adulterous impersonator.<br />I can`t believe it!<br /><br />For myself I'll take Anna Karenina any day.

B000I2J6K0|4.0|I like this DVD cuz Erin is using resistant training without using any weight. I'm only in my first trimester, and all the horror stories I heard from the Moms and aunties, I was afraid to exercise like I used to. I stopped using weights in my exercise routine, and I just don't feel very good at all. Everything I do just doesn't feel like exercising anymore.    But Erin's exercise still keep my heart rate up, and the next day after the first time using this DVD, I felt the good-sore in my legs. I really enjoyed it.    Every movement is well-explained, and you can just utilize everything you have at home for the exercise. Simple to follow moves, and she does everything with you and counts for you.    The only thing about this DVD is that it doesn't seem like it's professionally made. It almost looks like she uses a home-camera, and without any professional lighting, she shot it at home. And there's no music. Or is there? Maybe very light music in the back. When I first viewed the DVD, I thought it was crappy production, but seriously, it doesn't affect anything. When you are exercising, you don't look at the screen much anyways.    Overall, I recommend this DVD.
0345479092|5.0|It seems that \\"sleep\\" is one of the biggest issues that a new parent will face.  I typically hear new parents asking \\"Does your baby sleep through the night?\\"  I have never asked that question...it doesn't occur to me to ask because my son has been sleeping through the night since he was 8 weeks old. I owe this to the Baby Whisper, Tracy Hogg.     I owe more than a good nights sleep to Tracy Hogg.  I owe her for the confidence that her insights instilled in my husband and me.  She taught us to understand the different types of cries of a newborn and how to respond to each.  My son never had to \\"cry it out.\\"          I recently bought multiple copies of this book to give as shower gifts.  I will know if they didn't read it if I hear them asking \\"does your baby sleep through the night yet??\\"
0316067598|5.0|I read this book cover to cover during a flight out west.  The opening chapters reminded me of my own Navy days, of camraderie, pushing our boondockers through boot camp at RTC Great Lakes, and the profound pride of completing various levels of Navy training.  I never tried to become a SEAL; being a submariner was enough for me.  But if part of you didn't want to at least try for it after you finished reading the book, you didn't read it closely enough.<br /><br />Excellent work, HM1 Luttrell.
