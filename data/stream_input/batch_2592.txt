B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has amazing graphics and wonderful mystery! The problem solving and hands-on participation are intriguing. Highly recommended for anyone who likes a true brain stretching game.
0553801473|5.0|Bought this for my husband for his birthday and he really enjoyed it. Couldn't put it down most nights and zipped through it! Can't wait for the next one!
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|It's been awhile since I read comics and figured the Watchmen would be a good one to start with. Fantastic story and plot. Highly recommend it.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|The bad and the worse of war. The movie has two halves, the grueling preparation for war and the ugly reality of it. Poignant and entertaining. Kubrik tries to expose the brutality of human carnage and insanity in wartime.
B001AXME2S|5.0|Every song deserves a great rating and more. I am glad I purchased the CD. I hope there other CDs are just as good.
B003UESJJC|5.0|War and the human psyche as masterfully filmed by Coppola. He did it to the classic &#34;Godfather&#34; and he does it again to Viet Nam.
B0016O95IW|5.0|Every song deserves a great rating and more. I am glad I purchased the CD. I hope there other CDs are just as good.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Historically fascinating and a page turner for sure.  This book kept me guessing right up to the end.<br />What a sad, sad, time in Russia's history.  The characters are perplexing, yet believable.  I think you will enjoy this book.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|I enjoyed this book however, be forewarned that there are heavy doses and lengthy passages of nearly impossible to tolerate melodrama.  I know - heresy to speak such a truth in the Temple of Nalini Singh.  I am a fan of her work, truly.  I just found lengthy passages here boring because they read like bad soap opera melodrama.  It wasn't true of the whole book.  I think a strong edit would have tightened up the overall structure and resulted in elimination of a lot of what I'm mentioning.  Nevertheless, a nice addition to the series.  Now...if only she'd get busy cranking out more about the angels...
B005IQZB14|5.0|I want to read her second book.  What an endeavor to walk that trail alone especially under such hardships.  She is a strong young lady and I admire her tremendously.  I could not dream of doing such a thing, not to mention doing it.
B0041VV03A|1.0|This movie has every perversion known to the human imagination: trans-humanism, bestiality, transsexualism, murder, mutilation, inappropriate relations (man has his girlfriend's mutant daughter), rape/incest (woman gets raped and impregnated by her female-to-male transsexual mutant son).<br /><br />This movie is filth.<br /><br />Pure, unadulterated filth.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Fantastic Album, Great New Songs, Original Material, Perfectly sung.  I am looking into purchases more of this CD to give as gifts to friends and co workers taht I know will enjoy it as much as I do.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|I have yet to listen to any music composed by Hans Zimmer that I have not loved; In fact most of the music I work out to is composed by Has Zimmer. This was definitely a great follow up to the Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises sound Tacks to my play list.
0142421715|4.0|This book was pretty good.  The story took a little bit longer to tell than I wanted but I loved the ending and am looking forward to reading the last booked, Reached.  I would recommend this book to young adults and adults that like to read a good, clean book with some intrigue in it.
B008C20TDG|5.0|The food is delicious and the planning advice is right on!  A great book to help you improve your eating habits.
0385349947|3.0|The pages of the book came bound in disrepair.<br />Other features very well.<br />The book is interesting, bout could be better.
B00BPWDMP2|3.0|However, I'm slightly disappointed that I don't like more of the songs.  On the last album there were a lot of sleepers, ones that weren't on the radio right away but were great songs.  On this album, not so much. :(
B00846REIS|4.0|Nice, entertaining and enjoyably erotic book. Characters are interesting and attractive. It was hard to put the book down. Enjoy!
B007HO392S|4.0|Carrie Underwood never fails to please.  This CD has a lot of great songs and Blown Away is my favorite.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not put this book down. I have not read a Grisham book for years because I got tired of his writting. This book is way so much better than I expected.
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|This album is ok, it's a shame you have to buy 5 or 6 CD's today to get one whole album of good songs.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love this game, only problem that I found was when you hit level 9.  I want to get to level 10 and can't because of the objectives.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This movie is much better than any of the Mission Impossible movies.  The story is more suspenseful, and the acting is much more realistic.  Enjoyed the film, and will be interested to see the sequel (which there likely will be).

0596005903|1.0|I have been developing linux device driver for 5 years. 5 years ago, I purchased and read this book. This book was confusing to me then. 5 years later, after I wrote 5-6 device driver, I check back this book. It is still confusing. The author just throw all kinds of random information to you without the clear logic to explain why. And they misses some of the most important information, such as: what copy_to_user or copy_from_user really do? They also failed to show and explain the most basic information: where is actually kernel space and user space?<br /><br />Anyway, the most userful information when I wrote a linux device driver is other driver code in kernel source and google. This book is not even useful as a reference because it is not complete.<br /><br />I also want to add: this book use a useless scull driver as an example. Why do not they use some real driver code instead of scull driver that achieve nothing useful.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great game. i love mysteries.  needed a bit of help twice but managed to get through it quite well.  will definitely be buying another game from this company.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It is free and fun.  Try it.  Works well on my kindle fire HD.  No bugs yet that I have ran into, and you can progress easily without spending money.
0679805273|5.0|this  will be a gift for my children when they finish school. they both just finished pre-k and reading the first teacher's notes to each of them already has me teary.  I love the book, and will have to find a way to read it to them without them finding the inscriptions while I can
B00992CF6W|3.0|Fun but you can't mine redstone or obsidian. So you spend a lot of time mining and then you can't get the good stuff?  Haven't come across any lava yet either.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hoessini writes stories about Afghanistan that reflect what was happening there during his growing up years. I am enjoying this novel particularly because Hoessini is a brilliant author who weaves fact into his fictional accounts of every day life there. If you enjoyed The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, you will definitely enjoy this novel as well.

1423124960|4.0|The book is very attractive looking. It has silver lining pages and is full of bright colorful pictures.<br />I got it for a very good deal at amazon during Christmas ($5) and definitely worth the price. My daughter loves listening to all the princess stories.
0545123283|5.0|I liked this book because it came in great condition and the story is just great. I highly recomend this book.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I bought this book at the mall. So I'm reviewing the paperback not the ebook. I love this series.  Cassandra Clare does an awesome job keeping the reader hooked from page one all the way to the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a really great book! I absolutely loved reading it!<br />I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
B00BGGIW2K|5.0|This album is absolutely glorious, and the vinyl plays flawlessly. I have no qualms at all. Woman is definitely one of my favorites in my collection now. Definitely worth the money!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Enjoyed this book. I got this book because it was free but once I started it could not wait to finish. Now I am hooked. Can't wait to read some more about Maggie Newberry. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes murder mystery.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|I REALLY like the second one better than the first, and I happened to see the second one before viewing the first.  Both are fun to watch.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wow is all I can say. This leaves you with your mouth open and shocked at the end!! Can't wait for more!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We loved this game! My niece usually plays the mindless cooking games and gets bored quickly, but this one really kept her interest and made her think.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I didn't buy this because of all the negative reviews.  I took it out of the library.  I thought it wrapped things up nicely and I really enjoyed it.  Maybe it helped that I didn't pay for it.  Very satisfied!
0307887448|5.0|Except for the author's bigoted dissertation on the evils of Christianity, I enjoyed this book immensely. Great plot, direction, pacing and characters. Narration by Wil Wheaton of Star Trek Next Generation was frosting.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It's a little hard to navigate to different locations or favorites. I think the interface could be a little more intuitive to use, but maybe it's just me. I would prefer a different layout, but this works.
0812550706|5.0|Listened to this book on a cross-country move. Made the trip go by incredibly fast because I was enthralled the entire time! One of those books you think about for years to come.
B00AQLGXTU|5.0|This book I have been waiting to read for ages, as I managed to score an ARC of the first novel back before it was released. However, things have gotten in the way so I have had this sitting on my Ipad for a few months now and then I think I must have seen something yesterday that sparked my interest back with this book, so this morning with my cup of tea - I read it from cover to back , in one sitting. I love this series so much as it mixes my two favourite genres/things together we have the Dystopian feel of the future society and then we have the Reality TV show of the Prince picking his princess - A Cinderella Story. In The Elite , we read as it is down to six girls at the beginning and then four and slowly it dwindles down to three girls. Celeste - the spoilt brat , Kriss and America . In The Elite, we read as America is still torn between her love for Aspen and the new found love she has for Prince Maxon. We can read that she wants to be with the Prince, but is filled with self-doubt as she is near the lower scale of the castes. This novel is one that if you are a crier in books, then about three quarters of the way through , you will need tissues as my eyes started to water. This incident casts more doubt into America's mind as she wonders to become Queen do you need to lose all that you are and the compassion and empathy towards others- especially those you love and desire. Near the end of this novel, our minds start to waver as we wonder if America will be the chosen one or whether it will be Kriss as she seems to be more accepted of the Royal's mannerisms etc.  With a boost of help from those who America loves and has come to adore, can she prove to the King and Queen and Maxon that she is the one he should be with.<br />Find out in Book #2 The Elite and now I cannot wait to read the SS - The Prince and await for Book #3 - The One

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I'm primarily a console gamer, but dabble in casual gaming.  This one is a whole lot of fun, and really encourages you to play over and over to upgrade vehicles, get further on the courses and unlock new stuff.  And you can't beat the price.  Literally hours and hours of play.
B0018M6J90|5.0|Amy Adams is a standout in this gem of a movie. This is one I always wonder why it was not a bigger success at the Box Office considering it is really, really good.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun and addictive. great new modern version of puzzle solving. can't wait for more. please update this game soon. thanks
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|Finally finished, but sad to see her go.  It's been a good series & a new type of book for me to read.  It has opened a door on a new area of books
1573225517|2.0|This book was really promising in the first couple of chapters, I really liked reading about the eccentric record store workers and the interesting and hilarious interactions that they had with their customers.  Then the book goes... nowhere.  I read in reviews about all of these top 5 lists they are supposed to be making but there are only a couple of them, and not that funny.  Rob is mostly just sitting there feeling sorry for himself when he should be focusing on the American folk singer who had a thing for him.  Instead he starts stalking his exes.  I can't feel sorry for him, and with no empathy for a character there is no interest in him.  I'm really baffled by all of the glowing reviews for this book.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|this movie is awesome! really shows that things will work out in time, if it is truly meant to be.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The book includes good research of the time period 1933-1949 and is historically quite accurate. Excellent book for anyone who has in interest in history.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Not as good as his other books, but still very realistic. His other two books were hard to put down, but I struggled to finish this one.

B003KK65KG|4.0|This writer keeps you interested is hard to put down.  Very realistic and very scarey, similar situations have occurred in schools in America.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|This isn't your normal girl coming of age movie.  It's high action and suspense.  The characters involved me.  The score fit the movie but didn't overwhelm it.

B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I love the character of Dexter. you never decide if it is bad or good person, also all the other people make a great roll.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is amazing on pc and tablet but needs updates. Their needs to b double chests and make potions and bigger worlds. Other than that it is really fun.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|This series reflects the best of British humor. The story lines are sweet and clever, and the animation is top notch. For a simple escape it's a great prescription.

1616550414|5.0|I had bought this as a present for a friend's birthday who likes the LoZ series very much, and I have to say with how wide their eyes were this was quite a hit on actually his whole family!<br /><br />+The book is a must-have for LoZ fans, even I, a person who am not much into the series thought this would be something I would want for other series I have seen.<br /><br />-Obviously this is a book for LoZ fans, or some people who would look to the book for artistic inspiration since the drawings are stunning, stunning!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I could not put it down.  As the story unfolded, I found myself reflecting on my own life, that of my family and how I could have done things better in my younger years.<br />I likened it in a more serious way to some of the earlier writings of Anne Tyler, such as The Accidental Tourist, Breathing Lessons, or more recently Noah's Compass.  My emotions ranged from wanting to shake Harold, to wanting to shake his wife, to feeling a deep sense of compassion for both.<br />It is a powerful book.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Works like a charm. Bright flash light. I am on my 3rd recharge/discharge cycle as part of the training of the battery so I will update later if problems arise.     Well right about Halloween 2014 My Anker 8400ah charger conked out. It would charge up and hold the charge and the flash light would work but I could not charge any devise with any cords from either port. I double checked all the cords from other USB charging ports on my desktop and laptop computers just to make sure and they worked just fine. I waited several weeks before shopping for a new charger when I see that Anker gives an 18 mother warranty. I called with just a day or two to spare and Anker will be refunding my Amazon purchase price to my card as my devise is no longer made. All I had to do was give my Amazon order number and email and I will have my refund. Anker customer service was wonderful as most reviewers have stated. I will be buying a new Anker white devise in a few days after my refund is credited.     I am not going to deduct any stars as the customer service guy was so professional.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is so awesome GAMLOFT did a great job making it.  The controls are easy to understand the whole game is easy to understand. The whole game is based on one thing. I'm not going to ruin the game for the people who want to get it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|great movie, great message and scenery I would recommend this movie to family and friends, we need more movies like this one.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I found Book 3 of this Trilogy not quite as good as the first two, which I LOVED!!  Stieg Larsson had way too many Swedish names of places and streets.  Many were similar to each other and it was difficult to keep up with them.  Besides, many of the names were not necessary to the story, in my opinion!  But I do recommend it to finish up the Millennium story!  Too bad the author has died!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I can think of 3 VERY good reasons why I'm giving this album 5 perfect stars.<br /><br />-  Many of us have waited YEARS for Ozzy to rejoin the other members of Sabbath and release a studio album together.  While not technically a *full* reunion given the fact drummer Bill Ward isn't contributing, it's probably the closest we'll ever get to a reunion on a studio album.  Ozzy is, in my opinion, the best lead singer the band ever had.  Ronnie James Dio is incredible too, don't get me wrong, but it all started with Ozzy so he deserves the most acknowledgement.<br /><br />- These band members are now in their mid 60's and *still* rocking out, rather amazingly (especially considering their heavy use of drugs over the years).  Just the fact everyone's still alive is amazing enough, but capable of releasing music that's not only pretty good from a musical point of view, but actually ROCKS?  Yes, Black Sabbath is back!<br /><br />- Instead of writing generic hard rock music like most artists nowadays, Black Sabbath went the extra mile for this one.  They went ALL the way back to square one.  That being, their debut album with bluesy guitar solos.  I was NOT expecting this at all.  This album is loaded with blues, and combining blues with metal makes a winning formula.  Tony Iommi's guitar solos might possibly be even better now compared to his younger days on the classic Sabbath material.  That's just... impossible to believe.  He's really developed a feel for the blues, and it shows.  Not that this is strictly a blues album- just many of the guitar solos are.<br /><br />Let me begin describing all the songs.<br /><br />\\"End of the Beginning\\".  The first 3 minutes will TOTALLY remind you of \\"Black Sabbath\\", the title song from the bands debut.  Now the drum fills from Brad Wilk really can't compare to the legendary work of Bill Ward, but darn it, they come *close* on this track.  The lyrics about the future, animations and robots are pretty decent and recall the Technical Ecstasy/Never Say Die period when Black Sabbath sort of went futuristic for a short period back then (those of you that remember the late 70's probably remember this particular craze- EVERYONE wanted to know what the future would hold... none of us ever would've predicted texting, mobile phones and all that crap though, but that's another subject).  Anyway, \\"End of the Beginning\\" eventually goes through a major tempo change in the middle that unfortunately plods in a limp, mid-tempo kind of way that reminds me of the mid-section from \\"Hand of Doom\\" (musically I mean- lyrically this isn't drug-related like \\"Hand of Doom\\") but not quite as memorable.  Ozzy's sincere lyrics (or rather, Geezer's lyrics- whoever's contributing the words these days) are always positive.  It should be noted that once this part of the song arrives, the evil tone of the first 3 minutes is completely gone as the classic onslaught of guitar riffs that once made Black Sabbath so powerful occurs, and these riffs play a dominate role from here on out.  Again though, the riffs themselves aren't as memorable as the early 70's years, but at least the band members are *trying*.  My favorite lyric in the song is the one that goes \\"Sympathize until they set you free!\\"  I LOVE Ozzy's voice when he sympathizes- it's why I love the Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath album so much, where Ozzy's emotions are just insane.  This song contains moments of similar emotional brilliance that first made me love Black Sabbath so many years ago.  Overall, not as tightly constructed like classic Sabbath, but a really commendable and listenable effort nonetheless.<br /><br />\\"God Is Dead\\".  This song should NOT be following \\"End of the Beginning\\" given it's structured almost identically (at least, for the first few minutes it is).  This song should have been placed somewhere in the middle of the album.  Ozzy's vocals sound weak during the verse melody, but pick up when the guitar comes in.  Ozzy then sings the memorable line \\"Thevoices echo in my head, is God alive or is God dead?\\" The tempo change in the middle is a bit limp and awkwardly implemented (and perhaps lazily written) with an underwhelming riff and especially Ozzy's waning vocals during this particular part, however it's still decent on some level.  Perhaps I'm being a bit generous given my love for the classic Black Sabbath years, admittedly, so perhaps I just want to love this album so much I'm willing to overlook tiny flaws such as these.  I LOVE when the pace picks up at 6:28 and resembles the rhythm from \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\".  The riff here is really good.  The tricky lyrics are cool too- it's about questioning whether God is alive or dead, but to the unaware folks just glancing at the song titles, they'd probably think it's strictly about God being dead, given Sabbath's reputation for negative, gloomy imagery.  Tricky song title with clever lyrics.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's lyrically comparable to the Sabbath of old.  Geezer's lyric writing skills haven't deteriorated at all.<br /><br />\\"Loner\\".  The lyrics and vocal melody itself strongly resembles the one from \\"Johnny Blade\\" but significantly less heavy, adventurous and creative.  I'm probably as big a loner you will ever find, but even *I* feel like I can't relate to these lyrics.  No I will NOT be happy when I'm dead!  Just because I spend all my time alone does NOT mean I'm depressed.  That's a popular false belief.  I do keep myself unsealed though!  A mid-tempo and fairly forgettable tune overall.  The guitar solo at 3:00 is pretty cool at least, and I DO like the vocal melody despite it being nearly identical to the one written back in 1978.<br /><br />\\"Zeitgeist\\".  Yup, as you can probably guess by now, it's a \\"Planet Caravan\\" imitation, or rather, \\"Planet Caravan Part Two\\".  It's less experimental and moody in comparison, but still a decent song.  Hey, at least this song has a chorus (whereas \\"Planet Caravan\\" from the bands Paranoid album does not) and a memorable one at that.  The freakiest song on the album.<br /><br />\\"Age of Reason\\" has an average vocal melody with generic guitar riffs, but lyrically interesting thanks to bringing up the subject of how to survive in a new age world where everything is supposed to have a reasonable explanation behind it, despite the fact that we're constantly being filled with lies.  I love how the pace picks up at 3:30 but the mediocre vocals unfortunately continue to drag it down.  The moody \\"Lord of This World\\"-like bluesy guitar solo at the end is fantastic, though.  Tony Iommi only gets better with age as far as his guitar soloing abilities are concerned, surprisingly enough.  Drumming is excellent on this track too.  Brad Wilk is winning me over and making me believe he was an ideal choice.<br /><br />\\"Live Forever\\" mentions the most frustrating thought ever- \\"I don't want to live forever, but... I don't want to die!\\"  Yup, pretty much exactly how most of us feel, I imagine!  I LOVE the opening guitar riff and the chugging pace.  Classic song.  It's straight forward the entire way through, and it honestly doesn't need to be anything more.  Black Sabbath may be at their absolute best writing multi-part tunes, but sometimes a shorter song such as this gets the job done just as well.<br /><br />\\"Damaged Soul\\".  The Jimi Hendrix or Robin Trower-influenced intro is really good.  Ozzy's vocals are a bit strange, though, especially the mid-section when Ozzy sings the line \\"Death's hand and the crazy, I can't stand the light of day.  God of the almighty never answers their call, Satan is just waiting for the righteous to fall to him\\".  Ozzy could sing this line better (then again maybe he can't, who knows).  The guitar solo is really similar to the \\"Black Sabbath Suite\\" from the bands debut as I prefer to call it (the 15-minute jam piece that concludes side two) with tremendously melodic and enjoyable guitar lines.  The bluesy guitar parts of this song are clearly the highlights, regardless how Hendrix-like they are.  The harmonica unfortunately is underused until the very end when the band just lets loose and jams for a minute- this is my favorite part of the whole song.  \\"Damaged Soul\\" proves Black Sabbath used to be one mighty and powerful blues band at one time.  The song grows on you after a while which is encouraging.  By the way I love the line \\"The future has ended before it begun\\" and the guitar solo at 5:45 totally sounds like Robin Trower's classic \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\".<br /><br />\\"Dear Father\\" is when we arrive to the one and only low point.  Unappealing verse melody with only a so-so guitar riff.  Actually it's a WAY below average vocal melody from Ozzy.  It's borderline unmelodic nonsense.  The chorus is unforgivably bland and cliched the same way as Ozzy's \\"Revelation (Mother Earth)\\".  \\"Dear Father\\" could actually pass as a continuation of that Blizzard of Ozz tune.  The pace picks up 4 minutes in, but the quality of the vocal melody does not improve I'm afraid.  Still alarmingly generic.  \\"Junior's Eyes\\" is a MUCH better and more heartfelt song pertaining to Ozzy's relationship with his father.  Of course \\"Dear Father\\" is probably meant to be tongue-in-cheek.  The ending with the thunderstorm/church bells is borrowed directly from the \\"Black Sabbath\\" title song but used to drastically less effective results here.  However if this were to be the last album Black Sabbath ever made, what a fitting way to conclude it with the ominous thunderstorm that rolled in from the debut.<br /><br />\\"Methademic\\" has genric and overbearingly loud guitar riffage with average No More Tears-resembling vocals from Ozzy.  Yes this song very well could fit in with Ozzy's No More Tears album.  In other words, a song that sounds more suitable for Ozzy's solo career than Black Sabbath.  I was afraid of that... but luckily this mostly sounds like a Black Sabbath album in both style and songwriting.  The lyrics are creatively written for anybody heavily addicted to drugs, and mentions what happens when you can't stop taking drugs.  I LOVE the line \\"Hallucinating in the chemical hell, ain't my idea of having fun, you're on a suicidal ride of self-destruction and in the end you're going to crash\\".  Really meaningful lyrics there.<br /><br />\\"Peace Of Mind\\".  The 3 most popular words all rock bands were using in the 70's!  The guitar riff reminds me of the one from Sabbath's \\"Country Girl\\" from their Mob Rules album.  I love the way Ozzy's expressing himself honestly here, and the creative riff exchanges around the halfway point is an interesting moment for sure.  \\"I wish somebody would empty my head, I'm so sorry for the things that I've said!\\" is a classic trademark Ozzy Osbourne line given how chaotic and unpredictable he's been all these years.<br /><br />\\"Pariah\\" (that I mistakingly wrote down as \\"Perish\\") has a Guns N' Roses-sounding guitar riff with awkward lyrics about someone named Pariah (perhaps a fortune teller?) being able to read your mind.  Initially the vocal melody seems forgettable but repeated listens reveal it's actually somewhat decent after all.  Hey, at least the guitar riff is good, as is the \\"Do you believe every word I say?\\" line and the way Ozzy sings it with authority.<br /><br />Overall, an amazing album with noticeable flaws given what we're dealing with here (older men without the creative spark they once had), but NOT enough to distract from the overall listening experience.  Honestly, it's just fantastic to hear an Ozzy/Sabbath studio album again.  That's the thing that matters the most.  Treasure this album because it might be the last one featuring Ozzy and the boys.  If so, rock on guys.  You're the best metal band of all-time.
B005FITIGO|5.0|This is a movie I could watch over and over and did watch twice already. Wonderful acting, great dialog, and very believable script. Well written, non judgmental account of the people involved in the massive financial screw up that caused the crisis resulting in lost jobs, businesses, homes, and many ruined lives.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great series about love, life and respect! My husband and I have both enjoyed the series throughout the summer months
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|The movie had what was shown for previews, but there wasn't much else.  I was hoping for more action.  Still ok.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|This movie reminds me of a cross between the Evil Dead series and Van Helsing. If you watch it just to have a fun time and not too critical you will really enjoy yourself.
B00149C8BK|5.0|I ASSUME YOU WANT ME TO RATE THE SONG I PURCHASED?  IT'S BILLIE JEAN.  WHAT'S TO RATE.  IF YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS NUMBER ONE THEN THERE ISN'T MUCH MORE TO SAY.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A good mystery, but a definitely painful subject ... the death of kids. Be prepared for a truly good story though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|yes they do not have all the levels. but it still is really fun because you have to solve all these different little mini games to open something else.
0393088774|3.0|The title says it all.  I enjoy Krugman's editorials and ideas about the economy, and the title caught my eye.  I just wanted to understand more about Krugman's proposed solution.  The book says (my words, not his) massive government spending is the solution.  Nice idea, but who will pay?
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I really was angry when I got to the end of the book.  I thought this was supposed to a trilogy.  I should have realized when she seemed to be drawing out the story and adding a lot of BDSM.  What is she trying to copy \\"Fifty Shades of Grey?\\"  Been done already Sylvia.  I think that Sylvia has really done a disservice to her fans.  This was supposed to be wrapped up.  Now, I really don't care what happens.  The story seemed to be heading for a nice conclusion.  Gideon and Eva were on the way back to one another.  Their relationship had matured.  They were conquering their demons and then.....wait till the next book.  Bah, humbug.....  DONE WITH GIDEON AND EVA AND SYLIVA.
B008JFUNHI|5.0|1.  This is a review based on a realization the movie is finally coming.<br />2.  I have listened to the audiobooks repeatedly, and thouroghly enjoy them....<br />3.  This movie-if following what was discussed in the commentary has been long in coming, like twenty years plus.  Due to producers not wanting to follow the book with young kids as the primary charecters, and wanting to change the story by adding a love interest.<br />4.  According to the commentary at the end of the audiobooks it should be a combination of Enders Game and Shadow of the Giant.<br /><br />I plan to get to the theater and buy the disk, and hope that Orson Scott Card (the books creator) was successful in keeping to the essence of the story, as it is far to long to be all in there....<br /><br />Read the books / or listen to them as I do...
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|kanye west is a genius at what he does will be buying this album to add to my kanye colletion.
B00932A4XE|4.0|This was a good movie to watch when aren't in the mode for anything in particular. It had a lot of funny moments about pregnancy and the experiences of both men and women from different walks of life. They covered everything; rich, poor, young, older, adoption. They did a great job and it gave me more than I expected.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|it is a fun app to play when you have nothing to do. it is very realistic and a great time killer.

B00BWJARHO|5.0|Acting was awesome...<br />Cinematography awesome....<br />Sets were awesome....<br />Story line was classic....<br />There really isn't anything to say except awesome movie!
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I have read three other books by Munro and she never disappoints.  Her stories make you laugh and cry.  I know that this is a cliché, but Munro is an artist of the short story.  This time, she includes four stories that are autobiographical.  Quite a treat.  I await more.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|This album is incredible.  It has a sound that will ostracize many listeners, but for those who appreciate this type of music and DP in general, it is absolutely amazing.<br /><br />The general feeling is clearly very deliberate and a lot of fun to listen to. I am only my second run through of it, and I find myself with a big grin on my face, happy, and dancing away in my chair while I type this out.<br /><br />If you like Funk/Dance or DP don't hesitate, support the robots BUY IT!
B008WOULPK|5.0|A very honest and personal memoir about a totally unexpected fashionable life.  The book is also full of the sweetest drawings of The Cod as a model living in the mod sixties.  I am only half through now but am looking forward to more.  The book is a fun and interesting read.
B008602KQI|1.0|Finally forced myself to watch this, because it was supposedly such a big deal.<br /><br />The sick irony of this movie is that it allows its viewers to feel smug in judging how horrible a civilization must become to make children become gladiators-- while those same viewers do not realize that by watching this movie they are participating in, and enjoying, the very same thing.  Oh yes, just because it's \\"fictional,\\" it's \\"OK.\\"  I did not get any enjoyment out of watching this movie.<br /><br />Again, ironically, people do not realize how sick our culture has become for this to have gained so much popularity.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Amazon has the best sales on the DVD's I am looking to buy.  I am a big fan of the Big Bang Theory and I love to rewatch past episodes.  I just cut the cord on cable TV and my DVD player has taken its place.  I am my own programer now and watch what I like without all the commercial interruptions.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I was unable to download this product..I am getting a Reinstall prompt everytime.  continue to receive Reinstall prompt after download.  I am using A Cruz tablet T301.  Product does not appear in the app store or application folder
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|I like history but found this movie boring. The acting was OK and the period costumes were very good. But find a good book about Lincoln, buy and read it will be money better spent.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie was eye opening but gave me the motivation i needed to start doing my own research about what is in my food. SO glad I finally caved and watched this..... I was really resistant at first because I thought it was just easier to live in ignorance of where my food came from, how it was made, and how it affects me and my family. Now because of this movie, I am doing research, asking questions, and making more of an effort to buy organic, local, non-GMO, products. I am supporting small local business and farmers as much as possible and I feel better informed about how to feed my family the best possible choice of food.<br />Also, renting this from Amazon was SUPER easy and I will definitely be utilizing this again in the future
B000HL0EEE|3.0|If you are a fan of Star Trek you will like this series. I found much of the premise to be silly. Several of the episodes have the main theme of the crew getting in trouble because they are just winging it and apparently didn't put enough thought into preparing for this mission to have basic protocols to follow. I.E. we're bored after a few weeks in space so let's just go down to the new planet and have a camping trip.
B000J2BRQU|5.0|I live fast and furious movies this one is the prequel to fast 6 kinda the story of Hahn after the fact great movie

B004EC5IUW|5.0|Love this movie and the franchise. I had my doubts because when I saw Neon Genesis it was too complicated but this movie changed it
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great book. The story flows very well with little down time. Not too much detail. Wonderful for a quick read.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|It was kind of a boring book if you like suspense and it didn't really make sense I couldn't figure out if it was a guy or different people.talking.
B001HN6922|5.0|Can't wait for the next Cars. My kids can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I like everything about this book I liked the Percy Jackson series so when I heard about a new book I was like OMG recommend reading this book
B004G600A4|5.0|I have two boys and they loved this movie. I'm glad it wasn't just centered on the female character Rapunzel.
B00000612Q|5.0|Buy it for 'Italian Girls' alone.<br /><br />'...she was tall, thin and tarty and drove a Maserati...'<br />'... I must have looked a creep in my army surplus jeep...'<br /><br />Classic stuff!<br /><br />If you're an(early) Rod Stewart or Faces fan you'll love this album. Still as good today as when I first bought it in 1972.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|This film is a classic among classics. Every single line of dialogue is quote worthy. It's the best screen play ever written.
B004WESFZW|4.0|Let's be clear up front. This is a Hollywood movie with elements of thriller/action and probably primarily romance at play. Yes it is very loosely based on the Philip K. Dick story _The Adjustment Team_ but it would probably be more accurate to say inspired by.<br /><br />But, it does gently poke at some larger questions on the subject of free will. And the importance of self vs. the importance of society. Though I'm not surprised which side it inevitably comes down on.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays an up and coming politician who suffers a crushing defeat in an election. The adjustment bureau working to the plan drawn up by The Chairman set up a meeting with Emily Blunt a rather more freewheeling character.<br /><br />Sparks fly and Damon's character is inspired to give a concession speech that essentially lines him up for future political success. They are never supposed to meet again. But they do.<br /><br />And from there things spiral as the bureau takes ever stronger measures to keep these two people apart and Damon makes ever more frantic efforts to find the person he feels is the love of his life.<br /><br />It's a well shot movie that switches between tension and calm fluidly. It helps that Damon and Blunt have a great on screen chemistry with each other and you can easily see these characters wanting to be together.<br /><br />It has what you might call surface depth. Asking questions about whether humans can be trusted with free will. But not exploring them too deeply.<br /><br />And I'm okay with that. Because it's a fun movie to watch and one that went deep into those issues would not be.<br /><br />There are avenues I wish it had pursued a little further though. They ending is a classic Deus Ex Machina although perhaps more applicable than in many cases. And they carefully avoid addressing the \\"What happens next?\\" question. Which is the really difficult one.<br /><br />Easier to stick with the love story<br /><br />So no this isn't a great movie. But it's a well executed one and an entertaining one.s a well executed one and an entertaining one.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|Extremely versatile...one hit after another. Should have bought a LONG time ago!  Vultures is one of the best tracks on the album.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Not your usual Daft Punk music. Quite a depature into the disco-sih era with Nile Rodgers on guitar. Love this song.
B0094WK9EC|5.0|I am a fan of this kind of music, for me it puts me in a happy place. I can see why many commercials and movies have used their music. They're awesome and the seller is awesome.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Difficult and fast-pace but if you can carry it out you're going to see results. Along with an appropriate diet, this got me bikini ready in a month. Love Jillian, but especially this workout.
B0052SF6CM|5.0|There is a variety of different beats, vocals on here. I am impressed with this music selection on here, his older works are great as well, Wish it was longer, though but I still can get my groove on.
1863514201|5.0|This is a beautifully illustrated, well-written instruction book.  I've been an artist all my life (oils, watercolors) but I was never interested in learning any of the needle arts until I happened across this book by chance.  Ms. Burr really teaches you how to 'paint' with thread!  I recommend this for any beginner to the needle arts, whether or not you have a background in the other arts.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|As a long time reader of the series featuring Dave Robicheau, I enjoyed the movie and the actors, (TLJ) did a<br />very good rendering of the character.  I wish they would have done more movies.
B0073CCYAM|5.0|Though I was caught off guard with its dimensions (I thought it would be bigger - dims might be on the selling chart, but I did not notice anyway, could be my fault), my kid looooooves the toy, it gave him a lot of smiles on his birthday. Thank you Amazon!
B00BGIC170|5.0|My husband and I LOVE this movie and everyone we know loves this movie, so i was surprised to see such bad reviews.  My only guess is that the people leaving the bad reviews don't have kids and don't have a clue that this is EXACTLY what it is like!  This is our generations &#34;Married with Kids&#34;... only the characters are way more likable!  So if you are in your late 20s/early 30s and have at least one child, you are most likely to love this movie too!
B004EC5IV6|5.0|I'm relatively new to the Evangelion franchise, only seeing Evangelion 1.11 previously.  But this movie was so much better that 1.11.  There is a lot more action and not near as much whining by the main charactor Shinji.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|You won't want to put this book down until you're done and finished with it. I loved this book and i know tons of others will love it too.
B00BHO7M5O|2.0|When I bought this DVD, I did not realize that it was a Region 2 formatted DVD.  I needed a Region 1 formated copy, so I haven't even been able to watch this DVD.  I can't wait to get a correct copy though.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book! I went through a ton of emotions reading this book- it was well written overall. It could have developed the relationship between Grant and Victoria a little deeper though. Great read! And quick read!
0061537969|5.0|The author perfectly captured the essence of how a dog would look and feel  about human beings if the dog could think or speak.
B00C061I3K|3.0|With all the presale hype and constant airplay, I was anticipating MORE of the Get Lucky sound.  I hope that the rest of the cd is what Daft Funk fans expect from this masked dou, but unfortunately for me, track 8 is the best one.

B009LMTDL0|3.0|Being male, only a percentage of it is written for me, the domestic/contributory partner end of her arguments mostly, and I must confess I have set it aside, having lost some interest.  So it's lost me, but I may add to this review upon finishing it.  Great statistics, research & arguments, however.
B004D7GU3M|5.0|This be good I like it. Sometimes I say ho sometimes I don't its ok. Records are round square ones no work bump and grind
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|We rented this movie based on trusted critic and friend reviews. I'm sure the story was fine, but it was just too gory for my wife to endure. We turned it off after 10 minutes. If you've never seen a zombie movie or don't like graphic gore, don't watch this.
B000NA2348|5.0|Own the (standard edition) album before i bought this: one of Bowies greatest.<br />I purchased this album + DVD for the interview with Dick Cavvet and the 3 live performances!<br />(and the bonus tracks on the CD)<br />Great interview even though Dave was playing with his “Cane” the whole time. (Literally a cane)
B001N3GUIE|5.0|It's the movie that was a HEAVY influence on all legendary Sci-Fi franchises that followed, including Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5 and many others. It deserves a place in your film collection.
B00000E7Q6|5.0|Great songs, i guess people don't like it because it's not \\"typical bowie\\"<br /> his voice is amazing in it'll happen someday<br />and the single black tie white noise is a fairly high point in the album<br />as is I feel free, I've been around, night flights, miracle goodnight, don't let me down.<br />Jump they say is a good track although the sax is slightly over done.<br />Lucy can't dance has a somewhat jungle vibe yet is also another underated gem and gives a more synthesized 80's Bowie sound.<br /><br />Being a traditional Bowie fan i actually found this album enjoyable and easy to accept. It depends on who you are if you were to purchase this album.<br /><br />The consistent sound it fairly jazzy, often funky, and a modern Young Americans
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the second season of Suits, my wife and I watched it all within a week, as we could not wait to see each new episode. A great legal drama, with a lot of witty and often heart warming moments thrown in. Highly recommended!!
B002W1GCX4|5.0|Some of the songs seem childish yet they are easy to love, friendly and remind me of a more “innocent Bowie”<br />a must have for fans.<br />I own the vinyl and cd.<br />Mainly for collectable purposes.<br />Songs such as “join the gang” and “love you till Tuesday” are mood lifters and I still listen to 25% of the songs of the album once every few weeks of so. But if you don’t own this its definitely recommended to hear a even more vast sound of David Bowie.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I enjoyed this film, it was fun and different from most romance flicks, considering the zombie genre. It has been a while since I have seen an original idea like this and I only wish there were more original ideas coming out of Hollywood lately.
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|Rockin album, the intro sets you in the mood of being in the theatre. A lot of the songs have a similar powerful fuel to them and fives an uplifting feel.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Great trial novel. Kept me turning the pages quickly throughout. This series has continued to get better after every book.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I agree with the comments by other reviewers.  It felt like it was dragged out just to be able to produce 2 more books after this.  Not a lot of story progression.  You could really see the influence of 2 more books in her writing.  Such a disappointment.  Felt like it was just a money maker.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I actually didn't expect this book to be as short as it was, and I'm a bit disappointed that it was. I feel like we got a bit disconnected from the first character and that his storyline was an after-thought once others came in. The ending also felt short and forced, which was also disappointing given the reputation Stephen King has in the writing community (I have only read one of his books previous to this).
0062206044|5.0|My nephew, who is almost 9, started reading this series this year.  Now, he wants the collection.  He was very happy with the book and watched to movie that goes along with the first three books.
B00BPA2PFM|4.0|Sony tips you off a little bit by saying this,<br /><br />\\"The Blu-ray \\"Mastered in 4K\\" collection is optimized so that 4K Ultra HD TV owners can take full advantage of the new 4K upscaling technology, delivering an outstanding near-4K experience. \\"Mastered in 4K\\" Blu-rays also work with all 1080p HDTVs for spectacular high definition picture and sound.\\"<br /><br />What they actually did to \\"Master in 4k\\", I don't know. What I do know, and Sony admits, is that this Blu-ray (and the others) are not versions of these movies in native 4k resolution. They are merely \\"optimized so that 4K Ultra HD TV owners can take full advantage of the new 4K upscaling technology.\\" The important part of that quote is \\"upscaling technology.\\" Sony 4k tv's have this new \\"upscaling technology\\" that takes 1080p resolution movies and, through a computer algorithm, makes them more well defined. Standard upscaling for 4k would be giving every pixel in 1080p 3 additional exact copies of that pixel to create the 4k image. Sony's upscaling, in contrast to what I just described, shades those 4 pixels to match what is around them, thereby creating a better picture overall. The bottom line is that a Blu-ray in 4k would be about 200GiB. This is not currently available and not what is being sold as of 2013. Blu-ray says that they are working on it though, so hopefully we will have it soon.<br /><br />You can check out how Sony's \\"upscaling technology\\" looks at your local Best Buy. It is very cool and my experience with the technology was very positive. Check it out and form your own opinion.<br /><br />BTW, I liked the movie. Plot is a little wonky, but forget about that and look at all the pretty lights!!!
0307474275|5.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is an exciting mystery novel written by Dan Brown, the major American writer who challenges truth about the Catholic Church with proposed conspiracy theories.  Brown's story is set in modern day Europe, bouncing between historical religious monuments.  His major aim is to offer an alternative religious history, which focuses on the descendents of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene.  Although the evidence proposed in this book is considered fictional, the story itself is exciting, some what believable and not too far fetched.<br /> Brown's suggestions and implications in the story may draw in readers of all types because of the nature of these implications.  The story begins in Paris, France in the Louvre, where curator and Pirory of Sion Grand Master Jacques Sauniere is fatally shot.  He is killed by a Catholic monk named Silas, who is working for someone named the \\"Teacher\\".  The \\"Teacher\\" is using the monk to do his bidding on a quest for the Holy Grail.  Once the body of the curator is discovered the police summon Professor Robert Langdon, who is in town on business.  Langdon begins to help the police decode the mystery behind the death of the curator as Langdon explains the nature of Sauniere's work and what it represents.<br /> The fact is, however, that the police believe Professor Langdon is behind the murder because of a note left by the curator that says \\"find Robert Langdon\\".  This is revealed to him by the curator's granddaughter Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer, who is troubled by the memories of her grandfather's involvement in a secret pagan group.  After this is revealed, Sophie and Robert begin to decypher the code left by her grandfather in order to clear Professor Langdonds name and answer questions behind the curator's death.  This task is not an easy one to accomplish, and it is not one either of them are prepared for.<br /> Professor Langdon is not a hero, however by the end of the book he is considered one by Sophie Neveu.  After the two unlikely friends decypher the code left by Sophie's grandfather, they are lead on a scavenger hunt across Europe.  Professor Langdon helps her discover the reason her grandfather was murdered and the reason she has been protected her entire life.  They encounter a multitude of characters that lead and guide them on their very own quest to find the Holy Grail.  They searched all over Europe for clues leading them to the Grail and never thought what they would find is the actual Holy Grail.  Robert discovers, by the end of the book, that Sophie is a blood decendent of Jesus Christ and that the body of Mary Magdaline is actually the Holy Grail.  At any time Robert could have retreated to the American Emabassy, instead he stuck by Sophie to help her discover the true meaning of her exsistence.<br /> Dan Brown has done a great job composing a novel that is appropriate for most people and it is exciting and hard to put down.  The story is very exciting and easily to believe which makes it very popular with readers of adventure and mystery novels.  The story captures the reader by challenging the theories and explainations of Christanty handed down for centuries and a conspiercy theory that has been researched and sought out by many.After the two unlikely friends decypher the code left by Sophie's grandfather, they are lead on a scavenger hunt across Europe.

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|My daughter and I have been playing this game nonstop (except to charge the kindle battery) for a few days now. I downloaded this game weeks ago and haven't played it until now. She is 8 and loves it just as much as I do! Plays very well on my fire!!

1401207529|4.0|This was a great, albeit different, look at the beginning of the Dark Knight's adventures. Definitely worth the read, Miller knocks the action sequences out of the park.
B009RH9HDS|3.0|This case was pretty good for the price, but there were a few issues. The main problem I had was that the charging port entrances are inconveniently placed. It is always to use the case while you are catching the kindle. The other reason this case did not get a higher rating is that the stand cannot lock into place. Not a bad case overall, the color came as it was in the picture, and it provides a good amount of protection. I am happy with the purchase, but would suggest shopping around a little more to a friend.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Woody Allen can be off the wall when making a movie, especially when he is in it.  This film is a must see if you are a Woody Allen fan or not.  In short an engaged  couple flies to Paris and the man who is a writer is taken back time to where all the great artists and writers lived.  This happens at midnight  Will not spoil it for you.  I watch it whenever it is on TV and finally just went out and purchased it.  Beautifully done.  Don't miss it
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome I personally think that any one can figure out what to do it is very straight forward<br />the only thing is that I wish I could have known what invest points were before I spent them all because they're really important

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|The man of steel limited edition is out of this world, I'm glad we finally got a superman that actually kicks some serious butt, Henry Cavil was amazing as was the rest of the cast. Hans Zimmer did an amazing job, I feel Hans Zimmer's music really captured Superman's emotions very well, I really felt that I can relate to Superman in the sense that he want's to fit in and he feels very lonely. Everybody can relate to those feeling's, and that's what Hans Zimmer's music does, it allows us to feel those emotions through the music so ,when seeing the film and listening to the soundtrack it makes the experience that much more rewarding.<br /><br />I saw the superman movies starring Christopher Reeves recently, and noticed that I wasn't very fond of the superman theme performed by John William's. I thought his theme was more about the exploration of space and kryton itself ,it sounded a little too happy for my taste,and superman's story is not a happy story. I'm glad Hans Zimmer took a different direction in developing the new theme for the man of steel, adding a new flavor to the musical palette of superman,everything that you'd expect to  hear is presented wonderfully on the soundtrack, it's emotional powerful and action packed, every great hero deserves an equally great soundtrack and finally superman has got one.

B00992CF6W|1.0|I bought this app to play with my kids. The newest update makes it not function at all on Android! I tried my ASUS Transformer and 3 different Android phones. It was glitchy even before the update, but much worse now. Reporting the problem to Mojang didn't help. I got zero response and no fix! But SurvivalCraft instead. Half the cost and works without a problem! Don't try for a refund either... you won't get anywhere there either!

B00B769XB8|5.0|I only review 3-D which I view on a 60 inch Plasma and as usual my main complaint is focus. Typically the issue is cutting cost or they don't really know what they are doing. There are those that want to make an art film which does not get it for me. I am good at spotting those and avoiding the cost of getting them in 3-D. They work as DVDs fine and are much less expensive. Now having said all that , these folks knew what they were doing even if I was not pleased with the focus. I counted as many as five layers in some shots . Some do jump at, past, and beyond you. Yes much of the film feels like a stage presentation but you are there. As long as you look at what they want you to experience . To tell you the truth though , I gave it a five because I enjoyed the show and liked the characters .

074401493X|4.0|The bottom line up front: this is exactly what I would want in a The Last Of Us game guide.<br /><br />Having said that, I just want to say that the ONLY reason I gave this item 4 of 5 stars instead of 5 was because of the shipping time. I originally pre-ordered it via Amazon, but when the estimated arrival date came and went and the game guide still hadn't been shipped to me, I canceled the order and bought it elsewhere (for full price, unfortunately).<br /><br />But, I just got the game guide today and (A) the key chain is nice. It's good quality, from what I can tell. The logo is cool and the weight is good. (B) The book is great. I love the heavy weight of the paper that they used to print on. That gives the book a higher quality feel to it. As far as the contents of the guide, I have no complaints so far. Like I said, I just got this today, and have flipped through it. It is broken down in a logical way. There are some introductory chapters and explanations. Those are always useful. Then, there is the step-by-step walkthrough section.<br /><br />I think the main reason I got this, though, was because I wanted a guide to help me locate the collectables. There is a chapter dedicated to this. That was awesome. But, what was even better, was after looking through that section, I realized that it may be a LITTLE cumbersome to play through the game and in each stage of the game have to flip through the Firefly Pendants section and then go to the Comics section, and then go to the Training Manuals section, etc to make sure you're not missing anything before moving into the next room/area. BUT, the authors had good foresight and planning because they included all of that information in the step-by-step walkthrough. In the walkthrough section, there are maps at the begining of each area that has graphical representations of where each type of item is (parts for crafting/upgrading, pills, medical, items for crafting weapons, firefly pendants, etc) and then as you go through the steps, there is also a written description of where the item is and a screen shot to help you locate it visually.<br /><br />I definitely recommend getting this.ugh the steps, there is also a written description of where the item is and a screen shot to help you locate it visually.<br /><br />I definitely recommend getting this.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I love the results from following this diet, but the book is to wordy, you get lost at times.  My husband and I both are following the guide lines in the book, he in one week lost 6 lbs. I have lost 2.6 in two weeks.

034554398X|5.0|If THE SONG OF ICE AND FIRE were a roller coaster, it would start slow. It would warm you up with some loop-the-loops and a few drops big enough to make your stomach fly up to your throat, and you'd be thinking: this is just about the best roller coaster ever, wow, I am impressed. But all the while you'd be climbing, climbing, climbing, and you'd hear the gears ratcheting, and all of a sudden you'd find yourself teetering in front of the longest drop you'd ever seen, and you might wish you could turn around and get off but you can't, it's too late, you just have to take the dive.<br /><br />And that would be A STORM OF SWORDS.<br /><br />It's not fair to say that A STORM OF SWORDS is the best of the SONG OF ICE AND FIRE books. It's paying out what the first two books built up. In fact, it's got hundreds and hundreds of sustained pages of insane, twisty-turny payout, of climaxes followed by reversals followed by twists.<br /><br />But the impact of A STORM OF SWORDS is built on the foundation laid by A GAME OF THRONES and A CLASH OF KINGS. This is a series, not a trilogy, but A STORM OF SWORDS ends an act. It's got fanfare and cymbals and chances are that you will cry at least once somewhere along the way, and that you will shout for joy at least once, too.<br /><br />If you read the first two books, you owe yourself the joy & the heartbreak of this one. It's strange to look back at the beginning of the book and think about how much changes for each and every one of them.<br /><br />A couple of thoughts that seem safe:<br /><br />Incest really is the perfect, most symbolic crime for the Lannisters: they only love themselves. They'll cause great harm to win a marginal advantage, and both Tywin and Cersei strike me as dangerously short-sighted. They care too much about appearances; perhaps because the only magic the Lannisters possess is allure (the allure of gold, and riches, which is irresistible but empty). That's why they treat Tyrion so badly. They have gold, and people desire gold, even if it can't make them happy. But in a world with dragons and direwolves, what good is allure?<br /><br />Stannis is such a loser. He's everything that, as far as I can tell, GRR Martin hates. He's brittle, self-serving, dishonest about his own motives (\\"he never asked to be King...\\"), thinks things are 'owed' to him, and most of all, inflexible. I say chances that he will come out on top, or even alive at the end, are around 0%. This makes me sad, though, because I really like Ser Davos.<br /><br />Brienne is one of those characters I just want to hug and protect. I love the name of her sword. I love it when proper, old school high fantasy elements emerge so naturally in the plot. I loved the way that the Brotherhood Without Banners echoed Robin Hood, and Oberyn Martell the Princess Bride, but both were more fearsome and sorrowful in the ASoIF world.<br /><br />I love that this is a series that shows you how important and worthwhile and valuable characters like Brienne and Samwell and Davos are. And Maester Aemon, and Hodor, and Bran. I love that I get to know them and root for them, that they matter.<br /><br />I am terrified of Littlefinger. I am curious about Varys. I am rooting for The Dog, who, in his own way, is one of the most honorable characters in the series. He's brutal and uncouth, but he's also honest. He's no fool, and while he's done terrible things when asked to, he's done kind things...just because, almost without knowing why himself. There's something so touching about him.<br /><br />The Starks wear their honor on their sleeves. The Dog keeps his hidden, but it's just as real.<br /><br />And Arya. I love how brittle and fierce she is. I love her list, and her deep hurt, and her toughness. I want everyone in Westeros to fear her.people desire gold, even if it can't make them happy.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game has become a favorite in my game library. Right into the action and has a good progression for the character build. Looks great in graphics on my kindle screen. Thought this style of game would be tough to play on my kindle but it's not.
B009H7SCMA|3.0|I definitely liked this one, and it was rippingly unique--an erotic cricket-based sports comedy that examined class warfare. Yes, really. The prose is sharp and biting, and the hyperbole is mostly just brilliant. Gabriella and Jim are a tight pair of protagonists and they have lots of motivation. There's surprising moments of warmth and loveliness there, along with the (literally) balls-out silliness.<br /><br />The reason I'm knocking this one down to three stars from four is the splatterpunk style descriptions of sex. I am definitely not squeamish, but the joke got overused, and if you took out every description of a sexual event from the book, it would be about half the length. I wish I could give it three and a half stars, I do, but I have to admit I got a bit nauseous by the end. I would have suggested cutting good chunks of the book from the middle and end, when events just got a bit too played out.<br /><br />Still, it's a solid comedy and well worth a read. It's like PG Wodehouse and Hunter S Thompson got together for a cocaine-filled night of orgies down on the cricket pitch, frankly, and I really enjoyed it. Just make sure you have a glass of water and possibly some disinfectant off to the side while you're reading it.

B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Gold was found in Alaska, the rush to obtain it required a strong constitution and many dogs to do the work that horses usually did in the states. The environment bread harsh attitudes. Also in the testing of ones mettle one finds their true potential.<br /><br />Buck (a dog that is half St Bernard and half Shepherd) goes through many lives, trials, and tribulations finally realizing his potential. On the way he learns many concepts from surprise, to deceit, and cunning; he also learns loyalty, devotion, and love. As he is growing he feels the call of the wild.<br /><br />This book is well written. There is not a wasted word or thought and the story while building on its self has purpose and direction. The descriptions may be a tad graphic for the squeamish and a tad sentimental for the romantic. You see the world through Buck's eyes and understand it through his perspective until you also feel the call of the wild.<br /><br />[[ASIN:6304773528 The Call of the Wild - Dog of the Yukon (1997)]]

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|There were plenty of opinions prior to this release -  was Tony Iommi up to it?  Would Ozzy be intelligible?  Would this sound like a pathetic retread of their past classic albums?  For some reason I had no fears about \\"13\\" - Tony is the metal god and simply would not be content to rest on his laurels, knowing that he has been very fortunate in his cancer treatments.  You know the emotional tug had to be enormous, and that Geezer and Ozzy would be hugely supportive.<br />  So, here it is in a nutshell:  \\"13\\" is a great album, and shows all doom poseurs who the real bosses are when it comes to the almighty heavy riff.  Ozzy actually sings in a midrange voice, clear and without any trickery or foolishness he was liable to pull on some of his solo material.  He doesn't have the maniac edge of yore, but he doesn't need it.  Geezer Butler of course is the perfect bassist for Sabbath, and one of the best in the business, locking in with Tony providing the muscle behind the riffs.  And Tony?  He's great.  Always has been, always will be.  His playing is at its best, falling somewhere between Sabbath's much overlooked \\"Dehumanizer\\" that featured Ronnie James Dio and Heaven and Hell.  So much time has passed since their earliest days that the rawness of those albums is impossible, and the album is better for it.<br />  There are a few hints of past glories - \\"Zeitgeist\\" hints at \\"Planet Caravan\\", and \\"Live Forever\\" has some of the swing of \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\".  Producer Rick Rubin gives the album a brighter tone without sacrificing the trademark sound, but it's still Sabbath calling the shots.<br />  Fans need to note that the deluxe edition features a second CD with three tunes, and Best Buy has the deluxe edition with four extra songs, the last one a Best Buy exclusive.  I don't like this kind of marketing at all.  Yes, I have the Best Buy version, but I don't like the store because it has a terrible music selection.  Bands should stop favoring one retailer over another and offer all fans the same package.  If it wasn't Tony and Co., I would have deducted a star for this trick.  Still, it's doom like only the pioneers of that type of metal can do, and I'm sure all doom bands are paying serious homage to their idols.  Pity that Sabbath reforms with almost the complete original line-up while their heirs to the throne Cathedral retire the same year.nd offer all fans the same package.

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love this app. It's incredibly addictive, like, you freak out if you forgotten to check your dragons.<br />My sibling asks my mom &quot;Can I check my dragons on your phone?&quot; way too much, around every five minutes. Yup, it's that addicting. It has great, cute graphics and creative looking dragons. I'm SO CLOSE to level 14, and I'm going crazy trying to get as much XP as I can, I REALLY want to get to level 14 so I can get a water dragon.<br />I rate this four stars because I don't like how some dragons aren't that impressive. Most dragons look a lot like their teen version when they are fully grown. For example, when my cold dragon was level 4 (teen) and I fed it to level 7 (fully grown - level 7 is the largest your dragon is going to be) not much change happened. My cold dragon just grew larger wings. Personally, I don't think that's fair. I was expecting more features to the dragons once they are fed to teen to adult, especially more than just larger wings. There is a lot of growth from a baby earth dragon, though, I liked that.<br />Overall, a excellent app. Addictive, fun, entertaining, and cute. It feels like the dragons are real, like the second you take your eyes away from this game, you're expecting a dragon to be face-to-face with you. At least for me.<br />Two thumbs up!

(damn you public education) the book explains ideas on how various people have come up with memory techniques.  The author goes into great detail on the history of who and how these people developed thse concepts of memorization that have been long since lost. I never bought a book just read one ever in my life but I liked this one.
1781162646|4.0|&#34;Joyland&#34; is a combination of a murder mystery, a ghost story and a coming of age story, all wrapped in a non-chalant first person recounting of time spent by a college student at one of those old amusement parks you pretty much only find in stories like these anymore.  In fact, even the movie takes time here and there to condemn over-commercial big amusement parks that drove local haunts (no pun intended) like Joyland out of business.<br /><br />The protagonist of &#34;Joyland&#34; is telling his story years and years after the fact, his tone is bittersweet as he looks back at the fun he had in college and the angst that he got through, some of which lingered longer than it probably should have.  Our storyteller is likeable, though, and honest, and easy to relate to.<br /><br />The murder mystery/ghost story elements certainly take a back seat to the narrator's rembrances, but this is one occasion where King's light prose services the story well.  Some might find it too laid back or want it to be more of a crime novel, like the publisher promises.  But, ignoring that, it's hard not to get caught up by the character and the world King creates.
B005MMZ63C|4.0|Citizen Kane has been heralded as one of the greatest films of all time.  Because of that reputation, I thought I should check it out.  I'm glad I watched it, but I wasn't consumed with what a great movie it was.  It was a very good movie, but it had a lot of the flaws that existed in old movies.  The dialog was choppy and forced.  Great story though.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved from this book. It was a beautiful story that was told very well and in the most unique way. It is especially meaningful to me because I can connect well to Charlie's character just as I believe everyone can in some way. Anyone going through a tough time should read this and take every chapter, page, and word away from it. Touching and strong.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Another winning season of Walking Dead!  The only negative I have is that the series drifted too much towards relationship development and seemed a bit &#34;soap-opera-y&#34;.  More action!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I fell in love w the book. Couldn't out it down. The people in it came to life. I will recommend it for my book club.

0486278077|1.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is an extremely controversial novel in my mind. Unfortunately, I find that its weaknesses exist because of the power of its strengths. The main purpose of this novel is to explore the idea of the supremacy of beauty and youthfulness. Throughout almost the entire novel the characters, (especially Dorian), take full advantage of their positions and exploit those around them to be able to experience as much pleasure as possible. Most of the novel talks about the advantages of this behavior and the desirability of pleasure and beauty. I do not agree with the first 90% of the novel: suicide is not beautiful, people matter, and the sinful nature--encouraged by the enemy--is what tells us that all sorts of sensations should be explored and developed.<br /><br />This is where I found what I think is this novel's greatest weakness. The ideals and images it forces upon its readers at times physically sickened me because of their roots of evil. In the end, all of these ideas come to a halt when Dorian realizes what his life really is and he becomes so depressed and outraged with this self-revelation that he murders his friend, Basil; and inadvertently, himself. The author used the end of the novel as a surprise contradictory element to show that the philosophy explained in the beginning of the novel was all a lie. Unfortunately, this twist in the story does not contradict the rest of the novel enough to appease my distaste for the novel as a whole. The only strength I can concede to Mr. Wilde is that this novel is so well written that it forced me to feel so strongly about its content. The weaknesses of morality are only made more pungent because of the skilled literary talent of Oscar Wilde.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Plot: Substance abusing pilot pulls off truly miraculous airplane recovery with relatively little loss of life. Investigation probes his secret life of addiction while other stakeholders try to keep his name clean, whether he's willing or even capable of going along with their hopes and efforts.<br /><br />Acting: Doesn't get much better. Everyone is believable.<br /><br />Photography: Very easy on the eye visuals throughout.<br /><br />I just had to state that. This IS a very good film for many reasons, but it has one aspect that is hard for me to get over- the premise.<br /><br />Denzel's character recovers the plane from an inevitable crash, but how he does it makes every recovery effort in the history of mankind seem like child's play. His recovery IS a true miracle, and an outstanding bit of directorial work that makes the film worthwhile on it's own. In addition to pulling off a miracle, the manner in which Denzel's character executes it is legendary. He's in the middle of a true catastrophy overloaded with bewildering amount of information (bad and good info, all that has to be sorted faster than the blink of an eye), yet he eases through it like he was driving a van through a car wash. Again, this character's feat is miraculous. It doesn't go unnoticed, either- people directly next to him during that feat live to tell.<br /><br />Do they tell a story of heroics? Do they talk about a miracle that boggles imagination? Are they grateful and feel any debt of gratitude?<br /><br />NOOOO! No one does. In fact, most seem somewhat indignant about it and the investigation brushes all that aside to make the point that the character has a possible drinking problem. Actually, the investigators findings only prove that, at most, he's had two mini-bar sized vodkas before or during the flight.<br /><br />So, put all this into perspective. A meteor the size of a lake is about to destroy the Earth. A man with a bow and arrow believes if he can be lifted into space with a hotair balloon and aims at the right angle he can deflect it (Others have deflected pebble sized meteors like this before in this scenario so bare with me). Beyond all hope and odds, he pulls it off but five people die from some a spoonful sized bit he couldn't deflect. We found out he had two mini-bar sized bottles of vodka before he went up, and what do the people of Earth do? They crucify him! They want his blood! They want him in jail for life, at the very least!<br /><br />That's basically what the premise of this movie felt like and it was VERY difficult to sit through.<br /><br />I mean, it's easy to see Denzel's character has serious substance abuse issues- but that's something WE know about, not the investigators. But we still have to consider their logic- drinking is bad. Even under the guise that it impairs performance, how does that reasoning stand up to a miraculously, flawless, incredible performance?<br /><br />What if Michaal Phelps drank a bottle of vodka before every meet and STILL managed to win all his gold medals? Would we want blood? Would we vilify him?<br /><br />OK, done with my rant.<br /><br />Great film if you can overlook that aspect of it.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I have the trilogy on DVD but since i have a very large 240hz 108p full HDTV i had to upgrade this part of my collection. The movies look crystal clear and sound amazing.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|I am Oz, the Great and Powerful<br /><br />For any fan if the original movie or even just Sam Raimi, this movie is amazing.  The blu-ray pushes the format to the limits with vivid coloring and a very robust soundtrack.  It seems like its definitely taken directly from the source material with very little issues on the release.  With this version, the orginal pressing comes with the holographic slipcover of the wicked witch.  Also, this release somes witht the digital copy so it can be watched practically anywhere.  I highly recommend picking this up whether you saw it in the theater or blind buying it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book is something that mixes the trendy topic of urban literature now that is s dystopian world with something that fresh and new. While the love story between Ky and Cassia is heartwarming and tender, it's is so much more than that. It is about facing reality head on and making your own choices in a place where plan everything for them. A truly amazing read, you won't regret it!

0307341550|5.0|It's raw, twisted, disturbing. Its life; the bleakness behind the doors, behind the layers of clothes that hides the individuals we all thought we knew.  These shadows that were cast created a magnet drawing me to its pages physically and emotionally tying me down until I cried, the words so beautifully written for such a tragic situation.<br />It began when Camille's younger sister dies when she is thirteen. To deal with the pain, Camille takes to cutting words into her skin. These secret words have taken over her body and seem to have a life of their own \\"sometimes I can hear words squabbling at each other across my body. Up on my shoulder, panty calling down to cherry on the inside of my ankle.\\" We now fast forward 10 years, as news reporter Camille is told to go back to her hometown to investigate the murders of two children. Reluctantly, Camille heads out to stay at her mother's house whom she has not had a great relationship with and she also meets up with her younger half-sister Amma.  Some things never change as Camille realizes a lot of her old classmates are still living in town.  With not much to go on with the murders, Camille works with law enforcements and locals to piece the puzzle together.  It is when Camille realizes she needs to revisits her past to see the present she recognizes that some things never change, does she get the story she needs.<br />So many hard subjects are dealt with within these pages but the language was done with such care and balance that it was almost striking. With Camille and her self-mutilation the author spent quite a bit of time touching on this subject and I felt her words were so wonderfully chosen. I even found myself grabbing the tissues, as I thought the words were so perfect for the scene that just played out before me.  When you deal with cutting, drug abuse, promiscuous girls, and sexual abuse I think of dark and sad vocabulary with disturbing consequences but I found this book fascinating and captivating.  I believe it engaged me because of the way the author dealt with the subject matter and the psychological aspect of the book. I could not put this book down as I was mesmerized as what was going to happened next.  I can't say enough about this book except I loved it and I am looking forward to reading more by Gillian Flynn.  It was definitely a page-turner and one that I will never forget.lieve it engaged me because of the way the author dealt with the subject matter and the psychological aspect of the book.

B002VWNID6|4.0|This is a fun movie. Having seen a number of robin hood films this may very well be my favorite in terms of production quality and a good story that fits together and leaves you satisfied. Morgan Freeman is excellent
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci doesn't 'need' this review, but I am so happy to share how much I enjoyed resuming my quest to read all of his work.  I saw the movie of Absolute Power and knew I'd enjoy his novels, but somehow, I was sidetracked.  I saw The Innocent and The Hit available for Amazon Kindles and jumped on them.  I believe the complications on top of complications in this story are only exceeded by the sense of being with Will Robie as it all unfolds.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I did...and probably a million others have ;-)
B004S3MB2U|4.0|I lost my graphing calculator a while ago. I went through many different apps too find the best one. I love this app! I did get it for free, but if you think about it, 9.99 for an app or 100+ for a calculator that does the same thing. except the graphing part... but it is really good and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is an exhilarating and accurate portrait of an IT organization undergoing a DevOps and Agile transformation.

B001EC2ISA|1.0|The movie played about 2/3 of the way through and then froze.  I couldn't get it to work past that place no matter what I did.  It's a great movie and was very frustrating that I couldn't watch it to the end.

B00499QUK2|5.0|I am a huge fan of Elementary (Lucy Liu, Jonny Lee Miller) but that is now overshadowed by the brilliant acting and story-lines in Sherlock.  It is funny and keeps you guessing.  I really like how Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Sherlock as someone who is so brilliant that he sometimes/often lacks proper social skills in situations making him come across as an a-hole.<br />Anyone who enjoys the stories of Sherlock Holmes will not be disappointed with Sherlock!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Kanye has done it again. A masterpiece of artistry in every possible way. How he is able to relay both philosophical and political messages whilst still catering to our musical needs is beyond me. This one will be remembered for a long time. I get chills every time.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|True or not exactly true, this was an interesting and enjoyable read if you are curious about our Navy Seals and the raid on the compound.  I had just seen Zero Dark Thirty before purchasing this book.  The movie was a different perspective, so I really wanted to hear the Seal's side of the story.  Reading about how our elite troops train, the tests they go through, and their gear organization was interesting to me.  I really liked learning about how the Seal Team 6 members can choose their equipment and have it customized to their exact specifications, and how they don't have to be as clean cut as regular troops. Also how the author organized his various kit bags for different types of missions.  In the end, I was most interested to hear about the raid on UBL.  We will likely never hear the official account, so we'll never really know exactly what happened.  This book was well worth the read despite the claims that it's false.  I don't feel like the book gave away any secrets that we don't already see in movies.  I would recommend this book.  It's perhaps not a hardcore military affectionados type of book, but it was an easy read that provided the general public with some inside details regarding an exciting military raid.

B003MC5N28|5.0|I first read this book in grades school and have read it so many times since that I've gone through 4 or 5 paperback copies, they just fall apart after so many readings! I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to read, understand, and learn from this book as I have! Every time I read it I'm reminded of all of the lessons that I've learned over the years of reading it. Even if you read it in grade school I recommend reading it against an adult to see how different it is once you've seen a little of how life works!

B0055MBQOM|5.0|Color correcting a single screen let alone multiple screens seemed like something only the Pro's get to do. I thought it was beyond me. I knew I would need hardware to do this right and the cost was too great, or at least it used to be. Through a friends recommendation I looked into the ColorMunki product but still hesitated on the accuracy and ease of use. Then he did a display check in front of me and my jaw dropped. It's idiot proof and works like a charm. Now I can color correct with confidence and next I'm attaching this thing to my TV screen.<br /><br />The Display package is for Monitors and Projectors only. There is a bigger package for those of you who go to print, it's a little more $$$ but worth avoiding the headache of matching your screens to your printer. Arrived Quickly, thanks Amazon Prime.
1250012570|5.0|I rarely, rarely write reviews, but Eleanor & Park took me so wonderfully by surprise that I felt compelled to do so.<br /><br />This book is genuine, above all else. Eleanor is a unique, strongly-willed red head with a difficult home life, while Park is half Korean, a little afraid of everything, and very into music and comics. The story begins when the two leads are forced to sit together on the school bus, and at first, feel a great dislike for the other, keeping a solid six inches of space between them. Slowly but surely, through stolen glances at X-men comics and shared mix-tapes, the two outsiders begin to form an unspoken bond, which leads to much more.<br /><br />I fell in love with Eleanor and Park falling in love. I think that's the best way to put it. The way Rowell has the two so slowly, so genuinely come together is poignant, believable, and beautiful.<br /><br />I'm not going to describe anything plot-wise because 1) the power of this book lies in the two strong, incredibly well-developed characters, and I have little to zero ability to recreate that in a review and 2) I would not want to spoil anyone's experience of knowing anything before diving into this novel.<br /><br />Essentially, read this book. You will not regret it; it is heart-warming, wrenching, and all those other good heart- words combined.
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is timeless, very well written, and engaging. The antagonists are entwined descriptively in the lives of the protagonists, creating an interesting pull between evil and good. Definitely a good read or re-read for those who read it years ago!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game, no hints so no cheating, if you get stuck you have to keep going until you find the way out. Not too difficult, only eight levels and not many puzzles in each room so you finish quite quickly. Good for free if you have an hour to kill. Hopefully the game will improve if different levels are added and you have more to do in each room. A story line or theme would be good too.

It has a storyline... interaction with the characters... multiplayer as well as single play.... there's strategy in the wars that u need to follow... and u can go on in the game without having to purchase the aura u can earn them which is where a lot of the other kingdom games get you. This is definitely a awesome game!!!
B00BI6SSMC|4.0|Maybe no points should be given for an album that's listener-friendly, but for me, this one is.  I enjoy the album end to end.  Sam Beam has changed a lot over the years, but I enjoy his twists and turns.  My favorite I&W disc is Creek Drank the Cradle, but I don't expect the band to just keep doing the same thing over and over.  This album works on its own.  I enjoyed it more than Kiss Each Other Clean.  Sam seems to have found his stride on Ghost.  I'm curious as to what he does next.  The bottom line is that, if you've liked Iron & Wine so far, you should get this.

B0089LOG02|4.0|As an older teen, Molly knows she will age out of the Child Welfare System, and without a family she can turn to, and having lived in multiple, less than loving foster homes most of the life she remembers easily, she has little in common with 91 year old Vivian. How they end up meeting isn't really important, but in meeting Vivian, Molly finally finds acceptance, and Vivian finds someone willing, eager to listen to the story of her life.<br />As a young girl, Vivian was orphaned, and became a part of history by being one of the children on the &#34;Orphan Train.&#34; As Molly gets to know more about Vivian, she learns that her past is something she, too, can overcome, and she finally finds an adult she knows she can trust.<br />An excellent story combining the two eras, their common problems and a very interesting look at a period in history most people probably know little to nothing about.
1451627297|5.0|Once you begin it, you can not stop reading it! Great book, fantastic story! I would recommend it to anyone who like a little fantasy!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|This movie was so badly scripted in the beginning that I couldn't handle it for one more minute.  The soldiers quoting the Gettysburg Address and then the &#34;dream&#34; that was about the 14th Amendment - oh my goodness.  I'm sure the acting got better, but the terrible writing wasn't worth one more minute of my time.
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|It really saddens me that sci-fi cancelled this show. It's so much less hoaky than the rest of the SG franchise. It's wonderfully dark, serial in nature, and touches on a lot of topics not addressed by the rest of the series' or other sci-fi shows. What I would give for another season or movie to finish it off!

B008220BLG|2.0|Warm Bodies, I had high expectations for this movie, not to take it back to Redbox forty five minutes into it, because it wasn't my cup of tea. The zombies I grew up on, had only one emotion if you can call it that; and that was to rip you apart limb from limb and devour you...period! However, I do understand  this is somewhat different, a romantic comedy which in my opinon is neither idealistic nor funny. This movie was weird to me, not hardly enough action to sustain my interest or keep me awake. Furthermore, as I've stated before not even romantic just kind of all around creepy. It is one of those Hollywood vehicles best left on the pages of the book it was based on, were a I'm sure it made more sense. And, yet on the flip side World War Z is coming out soon with Brad Pit and I guarantee you those zombies in that movie wont have warm feelings.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|A friend got me hooked on this show.  WOW!!  Very addicting.  Love the characters and the action. Glad that the show is still airing.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|And, with that ladies and gentleman, the poor witch hunter staggered into the cavern and exploded on people. Blood and guts everywhere now, thats what I call a story. I just got through watching Hansel and Gretel, I came into this movie with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Academy awards material it's not. However, Most of you already knew this coming in, it is nothing more than popcorn entertainment enjoy it for what it is, action, blood, special effects, romance also cartoonish violence. The story line was way over the top, but who cares, you didn't go into this movie thinking about an actual  plot line did you? Well anyway I'm really glad I saw it, besides some of the witches were kind of sexy to me, in a perverse way,  particularly the one with the spiky hair do. And the use of the animatronics on  Edward the Ogre's facial expressions were priceless.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|This is one of my favourite films. Breaking the fourth wall done right!<br /><br />I love that Downey Jr plays a character that is so not the tough guy. It's easy to think of him in Iron Man terms, where he can throw a punch and be the hero in or out of the suit. Here, he is frequently conflicted about why he is trying to do the right thing. Is he doing it because it's the right thing, or because he wants the girl. This plays back and forth a bit, and it's interesting to see what the character does in the moments where the choice becomes paramount.<br /><br />Val Kilmer is surprisingly good in this film. I frequently find his performances wooden and without passion. It was not the case here. He brings it to the mat. He and Downey Jr play off each other brilliantly, and I don't think it would have worked quite as well with another combination of players.<br /><br />Overall, this film is fun. Definitely good for a night in :)
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|short cord, but this works perfectly for what I need.  I have this plugged into my netgear router at home with a 2 TB external HDD for network attached storage.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Unique situation covered in this book. Definitely not something that would happen in real life. Good drama and happily ever after. Wish there would have been a prologue to know where they end up.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|This brings John Rebus back to life and to another part of Scotland. Not all Edinburgh but along the A9 all the way to the Black Isle.  Another excellent story from the pen of Ian Rankin which I would recommend to any one who enjoys a very good read.
B003UBTX7C|3.0|I've read most of David Baldacci's books and have enjoyed them, liked his writing style.  This book was very &#34;wordy&#34; - I thought unnecessary to the content of the book.
B002YVAT72|3.0|The hinge broke on me. I had to get it replaced. Sometimes it doesn't seem to work correctly. After playing the record it skips to the point you should see after the music has already been transported and you are asked if you want to do another record.

B00A3AUGEW|5.0|There is just something about this kids voice that just can't be described. The first time my American Idol pick won the completion.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love this book. It's not as close as 50 shades of grey but it's there. I would defiantly recommend this book.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|While Dan Brown has cornered the market on interesting plots with all sorts of interesting information on secret societies ( in this case the Masons), his writing style has not matured. He still uses overwrought similes, stiff dialog and has a poor narrative voice.<br />If you can look past that, enjoy the story.

0385349947|3.0|I am of two minds about this book. It is full of facts about women in the workplace in America and gave me a bit of the feeling of \\"I am Woman Hear Me ROAR\\", but frankly, I have read all this before in other places, like [[ASIN:B002WTC99M Why Women Should Rule the World]]. She gave some practical advice to women about how to deal with the gender divide in the workplace, what to expect from a mentor, even how to choose a good mate. My biggest takeaway from the book is \\"Don't be an idiot, get on the rocket\\" - much like get the right people on the bus in [[ASIN:0066620996 Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't]].<br /><br />However, I found this book overly long (which is ridiculous because it is actually short), I think it was because of the constant name-dropping which made it seem much more like a personal memoir. And, I thought a lot of her advice was completely impractical for those of us who can't afford nannies, or don't have a mister mom to pick up the slack.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Good story. Fun read. I enjoyed it. I remembered most of he games and movies referenced. Makes me want to watch War Games again.

B0054SMIH6|5.0|I found this movie very entertaining. An even balance of drama, romance & fun. Matthew McConaughey has blossomed into more than just a pretty face  ( although he is still nice to look at), he draws me in and I forget he is acting a part. An A+ movie!

0425264351|4.0|I looked for this book after getting hooked on later Jack Reacher novels. This one is great if you hadn't read any of Lee Child's books before, but not as good as he is now. It's worth reading for the background, and enjoyable in its own right, but the later Reacher novels are better.
B008JFUO0Y|2.0|I gave evil dead two stars because i love the beginning but the movie really dies after and looses me.The family issued in this movie is not interesting one bit and why would the brother bring his sister to the woods for her as some sort of rehab, thats why there are rehab places out there.This remake is more like a soap opera then a horror movie and i was bored out of my mind watching it.I love blood guts gore and  i love the original and i do like some remakes hill have eyes was a great remake and hill have eyes two is also a good movie and way better then this boredom remake.Skip this crappy movie
1402210086|5.0|Cotillion was a lighthearted romp, full of humor and plot twists as the heroine learned to navigate the high fashion world of Regency London. I laughed out loud at some of the quips, and enjoyed following her escapades right down to the last sentence.

0385333846|4.0|This is the first Vonnegut book I've ever read, so I really didn't know exactly what to expect.  I knew that this was based on his experiences as a POW during the Second World War, when he witnessed the fire bombing of Dresden and the horrifying destruction it wrought on that city.  The details of what he witnessed form the core of this story, about a young man, Billy Pilgrim, who arrives at the front as a replacement soldier in the Ardennes forest just as the Germans launch their winter offensive (known to history as the Battle of the Bulge).  Captured almost immediately upon reaching the front, he ultimately finds himself working as a prisoner laborer in Dresden.  Around these details, the story tells of his life after the war, but the story skips around in time.  This disjointed narrative mirrors Pilgrim's assertion that he travels in time, jumping from time to time within his life.  Pilgrim's story also includes an alien abduction, but it is never clear if the time travel and aliens are manifestations of the psychic damage suffered during the war, of if these really happened.  This unasked (and unanswered) question lingers just beyond the actual story, and it is left to each reader to determine for him or herself.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I like understanding the background of the characters and what happened in their lives prior to joining Star Fleet.  I enjoyed seeing some of the characters from the series revived and recognized them instantly.  Overall great movie.
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|I've tried numerous products in hopes of finding a way to listen to music while swimming. After three weeks with the FINIS, I know that I've finally found what I've been looking for all these years.<br /><br />I've tried the more traditional route -- using in-ear earphones with an MP3 player (like the Waterfi -- awesome MP3 player, terrible earphones) -- but have never found a set of earphones that wil stay in my ears and/or not allow water in as I swim. Having to stop repeatedly to replace or fiddle with earphones is annoying and disruptive.<br /><br />The FINIS Neptune sidesteps this issue. The &#34;earphones&#34; (not sure what you call them, since they don't go in your ear) work well underwater. I'm able to hear music surprisingly well. There is no need to mess around with adjusting the &#34;earphones&#34; -- as long as they're on your cheek near your ears, they work.  You can hear the sound above water, though it's quieter and you need to shift the &#34;earphones&#34; closer to your ears, they work best underwater. (Having a little water in your ear or using earplugs can actually improve the sound.)<br /><br />My only complaint, and it's not a major one, is that the interface on the MP3 player is pretty rudimentary and a tad counterintuitive. I would love something closer to an iPod shuffle, with the ability to control playlists, etc. Having to convert my AAC copyright protected music was also a little annoying, but you only have to do that once (per song). If your goal is to transfer a large number of workout tunes and merely shuffle through them, don't worry about these reservations.<br /><br />I hope they'll update the software to deal with these minor annoyances (and get a full 5 stars), but in the meantime, I'm very satisfied with my purchase!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Good special effects and interesting story which does lead into the story we all know.  However, James Franco didn't quite pull off his part.  He wasn't quite the captivating carny nor the repentant good guy.  I usually buy these types of movies--timeless and fun for kids--but I'm not going to add this to my collection.

There are creative and challenging recipes for the uber-experienced or like me, the pseudo-chef that's game for anything! Polpo is a GIFT from Russell Norman, a gorgeous gift!

159463176X|2.0|I fear Hosseini has found and plays to a \\"Western\\"  audience starved for what they hope is an authenic window into Afghans and their current and past history. He uses rather contrived dramas as a substitute for any compelling character development . The connections between \\"stories \\" felt forced with far too much \\"hopping\\" around.<br /><br />The potentially most meaningful tale, for me,  was the sad return of Iqbal and his son which was left hanging. Perhaps his editors felt Pari and Pari in California was a better sell or more familiar to the author. Thalia's life , again, was a distraction and seemed out of place in this novel.<br /><br />The language used is clearly the authors  and certainly not that of most of the \\"everyday\\" characters.<br /><br />His work sells well but he has no meaningful competition.Too bad no adequate literary critics exist.  If Hosseini writes again he needs much help from better editors.[[ASIN:159463176X And the Mountains Echoed]]

0783227272|4.0|Story-telling in which Steven Spielberg deals with and cinematically enhances historical events to great effect--as usual.<br /><br />It seems he likes to make film stories that are about emotionally freighted (and sometimes prejudicial) issues--like extra-terrestrial visits to earth, the Holocaust of World War II, and slavery (which is really about Freedom), which is his subject here.<br /><br />One of the most touching and tenderly effective scenes in this movie is the one in which one of the imprisoned Africans, unable to read or understand English, discerns by means of a beautifully illustrated Bible the story of FREEDOM persecuted in Jesus, who is apparently the \\"sunlight-accompanied\\" (shekinah-glowing) God of these strangers amongst whom he and his fellow-accused \\"slaves\\" anticipate being put to death.  It is a wonder that certain American powers have not legally condemned Spielberg's movie for its friendly reference to the Christian religion in that scene.  If such a jailhouse event were occurring in actuality today, it's conceivable that a prisoner might not be allowed to have a Bible on government property.<br /><br />In other scenes, Spielberg is not so kind to the issue of Christianity, though.  Twice he has the Africans say about the Christians who follow them around and pray for them that these are \\"miserable-looking people.\\"  (And they do appear as grim, black-cloaked, pale-faced creatures.)  It seems as if Spielberg tries to balance out his positive and negative references to Christianity.<br /><br />Overall, with regard to the Spanish involvement in the slave trade, he presents an entirely negative impression of Spain and Spaniards, creating especially unfavorable imagery relating to Queen Isabella II.<br /><br />I noticed that I viewed the entire movie with my radar alert for each sign of prejudicial treatment of issues of any kind in the movie.  Besides those regarding slavery, the prejudicial views for and against the Christian religion, most specifically Catholicism (which ultimately came off looking pretty good in the person of the Catholic judge), and Spanish power (abuse of) were very evident and deliberately presented.<br /><br />Other reviewers of the movie on Amazon also mentioned mainly their reactions to issues of prejudice raised by the movie.  It clearly seems to be Spielberg's purpose to use his movies to create attitudes in viewers for or against certain concepts and issues.<br /><br />With some of Spielberg's movies, I remind myself that I think it's a good idea to be aware of how an artist is manipulating historical facts and their presentation to create certain dramatic effects and/or emotional convictions, and then to think about and discover to what extent I agree with him.<br /><br />Spielberg does make movie masterpieces that are emotionally and intellectually interesting and memorable.<br /><br />There's a lot of love and beauty in this movie, \\"Amistad.\\"  Not only in the ideas and the victory of justice and freedom that are depicted, but also in the striking physical beauty of the film.  Even though so much of the subject matter is horrid and grim, there is a lot of beauty in the photography and film-work.<br /><br />So, I think this is chiefly a work of love--about a much-to-be-desired brotherhood of man--and it is also a fine work of art.  An excellent, very worthwhile movie--although I guess I could have desired a positive balance allowing some amelioration of the presentation so entirely against Spain-and-Spaniards.esired brotherhood of man--and it is also a fine work of art.

B009178OQA|5.0|Amazing to see how a man dedicated his life to perfecting a dish.  I initially thought it would be how a man creates exotic sushi, similar to what one would see on a food or cooking show.  It's neat to see that perfecting simple recipes can be a lifelong journey.  During the life process, it appears Jiro lived a life of humility and perseverance. Amazing to see someone strive that hard without goals of money or fame- a pure artist.

B00AM7E4LM|2.0|I was interested in the first few chapters concering learning, then the book went all over the place as the author described 6 new skills he picked up in a year. If you have no real interest in those 6 skills, the book becomes tedious.

B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I had never heard of this movie before, until I found it while browsing Amazon's movie selections.  After watching the trailer and reading some reviews, I was excited to watch it.  I'm so glad I did because it was totally worth it.  It sort of has a typical plot of an unsuspecting main character discovering his/her special abilities that will of course be challenged throughout the movie.  However, if your a fan of sci-fi and super hero type movies, then you might like this too.  Its definitely worth a look see.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book, at first the trio of stories was a Lot to follow, but it all came together so nicely an  unexpectedly in the end. I want another chapter at the end. Very well worth the read.
B008S4FZ6E|5.0|didn't think i'd be impressed, but the book is actually well written, funny at some moments, sad at others, above all very authentic. throughout the book I had to keep on recalculating how old jt was when things were happening. it's amazing how young he still is, with so much happening to him right from the start. you end the book wishing him and his family all the best.

B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Where's the banter between John and the main villian? Who the F edited this?<br />The chase scene between the Russian Cougar and the delivery van was confusing. The whole father and son dialog was useless and seem to just be filler.  The action was mind numbing and not in a good way. Was this installment supposed to introduce Jr. for part six? If it was, I don't want to watch it! I cringed when Sr. jumped in front of the van and Jr. says \\"Dad\\" in a sad and surprised tone.  I was embarrassed for the actors. When Jr. figures out who the villain is and started acting all sad and betrayed almost made me send Amazon an email wanting my money back. Hopefully Jai Courtney pulls his poop together. Really liked him in Spartacus.<br /><br />Just looked it up on IMDB and a \\"Die Hardest\\" is being made.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|S. J. Watson has written an excellent story in Before I Go To Sleep. It is believable even when the reader is as confused as the main character. The book starts off very slowly (making it a good bedtime story for me) until the last section which kept me reading until 1 a.m.!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I love this so much. I don't own a kindle so Amazon Kindle for PC is just wonderful. I can buy or rent my books from Amazon without any hassle. This is great.

Track 2, 6 and 12.<br /><br />I love dance music, so for me this combo of a pure and soothing instrument of the violin matched with the beats of dance music is match made in heaven. Like Nutella and strawberries. My fave also ;)<br /><br />So, if u guys like violin and beats and awesome melodies, u will love this CD.<br /><br />JUST BUY IT! ;)<br /><br />There is nothin better than purely just music, with no words.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I like TED as there is always something uplifting to be found. It comes through crisp and clean for your viewing and listening pleasure.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's amazing how the game is just so organized an unique whoever hates it needs to stop watching Spongebob and get a life
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Depsite being about a serial-killer, what a great show!  Suspenseful, humorous, great dialogue, great characters!  I can't wait for Season 8!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Best game! Play all the time. Highly addictive! Don't ever change except to add more vehicles or levels. And it is free too!
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio allows me to access many stations from different countries. This also allows me to listen to the talk show radio inside my office in which we can't get good radio signal inside. It is also easy to search and save your favorites. Unlike Pandora, TuneIn Radio does not require you to sign in for you to use the app.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|It is fun but too small for Minecraft World fans: more like for Tinkerbell fans. Should have been half the price we paid for.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but me and my friend like to play together and with this new update we cant! I'm not happy that we can't play together. please add a multiplayer.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is fun for kids and Nemo lovers. You create a reef for a school project. I like this game, but I would add more pearls, plants, algae, and sand-dollars. Get this app right now. I guarantee you or your kids will love it.<br />- Deathheart
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome graphics, and just the right amount of difficulty. Similar to the puzzles you might see in Myst. Highly recommended!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|When I first got my Kindle Fire for Christmas 2012 bingo blitz was one of the first game apps I downloaded. Ever since then I've been hooked! Keep up the good work guys!!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is very touching awesome woo hoo I also like it cuz it makes u believe in God nice
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the most complicated and addictive games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Wish that there were more mystery apps out there with this level of intricacies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids and their friends play this game and they can play for hours building and destroying together and the fact that they can all be playing in the same game with sync option is wonderful.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|One of the best recordings put out by the best Canadian power rock trio ever. thank you Rush for consistently producing great music!
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|I love the Die Hard series. All but this one. Whoever wrote the script for this should find other work. The story is outright horrible. Stupid actually. I just can't believe Bruce Willis allowed himself to be a part of this movie.<br /><br />There are so my ignorant parts that I don't know where to begin. Throughout the movie, from start to finish, the story is so unbelievable. I know you have to dumb yourself down for some Hollywood movies in order to \\"accept\\" a plot. In this case, you have to sever your brain stem!!!<br /><br />I don't have the time to touch on the many instances of nonsense, so you'll just have to see for yourself. I actually managed to watch the entire movie, but only because I liked the special effects, and I had this morbid curiosity to know what idiotic end the writers chose. I wasn't disappointed!
B0065QUD8W|5.0|An enduring classic that makes one wonder how these stories were enjoyed in a time when even the digital age couldn't be imagined.  This edition was quite readable and handled well on the Kindle.  There were only a few errors from the text conversion.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellent plot line, vivid characters, and and exhilerating read. The author does an excellent job of managing multiple story lines with loose ties, while offering hints of future prospective developments in the saga.
0316056871|5.0|This book is very funny and well written! It had me laughing out loud! I highly recommend it. I didn't want it to end!
1427229201|5.0|Jeffrey Archer continues to captivate readers with the Clifton Chronicles. One of the best series I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. Can't wait for the next book.
B0058SNI94|3.0|its a cute shoe but the size runs small. i think they should have half sizes it would be just perfect if they did have it.. they are just cute not over the top.
B00008PX8P|5.0|ive had this disc about 7 years.its probably in the top 5 in the library.one of the first i owned.whats amazing is the the fact that you actually do feel like you are there.it has this weird ambience,that they are right in front of you.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Everything he has written has been amazing.  Highly recommend all of his books.  Absolutely loved this one as much as the last two.
1579126235|5.0|A favorite Agatha Christy that I enjoy again with every reread. A good introduction to Agatha and Hercule, I think, for readers new to either of them.
B000HAB4KS|4.0|Great action movie with thrilling scenes, plot and excellent actors. It also offers a deep reflections on how virtual reality may indeed transform human beings, and what is the real core of being human.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|An enjoyable movie version of the book. I'm not generally a great Mia Farrow fan, but gotta say she done good. Thoroughly watchable, and re-watchable, movie.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This is all I am listening to lately.  Love every one of the cuts. He has range and variety and you will probably hear him incorporating the sound of other artists that he may have learned from early on/. Just love it.  Hope the next one is just as great.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|BEST ONE YET!  AND THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING. I'VE READ THEM ALL FROM THE ONSET AND THIS ONE JUST BLEW ME AWAY! EDGE OF YOUR SEAT ACTION! DIDN'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN. I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THIS STORY TO COME TO AN END,AND NOW I'M SAD TO SEE IT GO. GREAT ENDING THO.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|heartbreaking account of genocide and thievery.  All of the ten commandments and all of the Gospel of Jesus Christ were shredded in this carnage.  mankind falls short of a Holy God to this day.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love games and I love having this on my phone for those spare moments of leisure.  Easy to play but sometimes challenging to win.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I really liked the first two books, I really really liked shades of grey and maya banks, etc.  saying this so you know the type of reader I am.  Forget this book!  I know you might just have to read it because you read the first two, keep your receipt so you can at least take it back.<br /><br />No dominate man good stuff, how many times can they say I love you, stupid, no story.  Shame on you sylvia day that you give this crap and are stretching it out for more.<br /><br />She lost it totally
B002ZG9846|5.0|Sorry, didn't get this from Amazon. Very good price at an other store. All I expected and more from Chloe Grace Moretz and Nicolas Cage! The 3 pack was a fantastic buy.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|I saw North By Nothwest for the first time.  I must say so many things are touted as being great that just aren't.  This was not one of those things.  It certainly lived up to the hype.  This film is quite the time capsule.  The difference in sensibilities and technology were very stricking having seen it for the first time in 2013.  I couldn't help thinking how today's technology would have altered of the suspense and drama involved being as they say out of pocket.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed John Carter. This movie clearly needs to be the first of a trilogy. This installment introduced us to the characters and history of Barsoom and now I am intrigued. There is much more to the story!
B00BIVN82M|3.0|Did not meet my expectations, love Michael Buble but this CD did not do it for me.Seeing him in person and maybe better sound
B00BI73CVI|5.0|This is a well done film that truly captures the emotion and spirit of the story. It kept us on the edge of our seats throughout the viewing! The music is phenomenal of course too!
0739378341|3.0|Not the usual John Grsham book was disappointed. Love John Grisham and hope to read more and more of his great works
B005HEVBGG|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV shows and playing it on Kindle fire was so beautiful and sharp.  The sound is just excellent.
B000ESST6U|5.0|This is an amazing production of Giulio Cesare. Sarah Connolly is awesome! I keep playing this over and over and highly recommend this opera. The music is beautiful and the opera is quite funny. Christophe Dumaux is great. Love his countertenor voice.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I love this game my kids &amp; I both play but it locks up on us sometimes. That's the reason I give it 3 stars! It only locks up on my kindle fire HD but on my phone it's fine!! It's aggravating when it in the middle of trying to rescue animals and it freezes! I hope they can fix the glitches otherwise I'm gonna have to remove it!!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Beautiful, understated acting defines this wistful story of British folk confronting advancing years.  The unlikely setting of urban India strikes a nostalgic contrast with the storyline.  The relationships and aspirations met or missed all add to the intrigue.  All age groups should find something to laugh about and reflect on in this unique snapshot of life.
B009DT98RK|5.0|I bought the DVD edition but couldn't resist and ordered my Blu-Ray version. The mixing is much better, sounding clear and loud like all my Top Ten concert discs. Peter has a wonderful charisma, smiling all the time; you can see the guy and his band are enjoying every minute of the concert. For Peter Frampton's fans and guitar lovers it is a must. Buy it, now!
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Very nice sound ! The conversations sound very clear  the volume is very high too it's small I can Put it any where and you don't have to charge it as much!
B000ICXQF6|5.0|Ive seen this movies do many times n its entertaining every time.  Finally got it on bku ray n it just b lo ows u away. Highly recommend ed.
B007W8S2MG|4.0|I have not put this game down since I got it and with it on the PS Vita it is easy to put it down for a few minutes and pick it again after a few hours and the game is still there. May not use the touch screen on the Vita but that is okay.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|good games lots of different levels to figure out. It is a bit confussing trying to find where to go all the time.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Castle is a smart mystery show with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing.  Love that aspect of it .  the chemistry between Beckett and Castle is fun and sizzling  but its not the typical COP show  Both characters are complicated and deep.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|Every time I touched something to initiate the game. It cost $10 with no indication that it required a purchase!!! The ultimate rip off and I'm not a kid!!!
B009R659L8|5.0|Great writing and alway a great twist.  Just wish she would write more books quicker.  Can't wait for her next one.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Lots of fun, but can be challenging and activating at times. Was used to playing Temple run 2 so some of the graphic quality isn't as smooth in comparison. Overall fun and passes the time.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Man of Steel was everything I wanted in a Superman film. I waited my whole life to finally get what I saw today. It was Superman in a sci-fi epic. I was going go into a huge review/rant but I'll keep it simple. Henry Cavill was perfect as Superman so was Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Michael Shannon owned as Zod. This was Zack Snyder's best movie of his career. He definitely made up for Sucker Punch. The origin story was done just right and the fight scenes were amazing! It didn't feel like it was almost 2 1/2 hours. Many complain there was lack of humor in it. There was some humor in it but at the right moments. You'll get your humor in the sequel. Also, stop comparing it to the Christopher Reeve films. They were done in a different time and they were campy and cheesy, yeah that's right I said it. I can't wait for the sequel! See it in regular Imax for full the effect.
B004INHTK4|4.0|East and West: a comparative analysis between differences of education in the United States and in China, especially within the family.
0307271080|4.0|To see the full review go to my blog, ...On The Shelf (dotdotdotontheshelf.blogspot.com)<br /><br />I've been struggling to write a review for Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's book, Americanah for the past week due to mixed feelings about it. Upon finishing it, I was equal parts content and frustrated with the book. While it met my expectations in a way, I was also let down by certain aspects of the novel. I end up giving this book 4 stars due to a lackluster ending and the general feeling that Adichie only meant her characters to be mouthpieces to voice her feelings on different cultural and political topics.<br /><br />At its heart, Americanah is a book about various immigrants who are trying to work their way through discovering what it means to be a part of the countries they've immigrated to while also holding on to their original cultures. For the most part, Adichie's story is told through the perspective of Ifemelu, a Nigerian blogger who has lived in America for thirteen years and Obinze, a wealthy Nigerian business man who still lives in Nigeria. From Ifemelu and Obinze's perspective, the reader learns about different race issues that go on in America, the way the Nigerian government works, and hears the stories of different people who have settled abroad or come home to live in Nigeria after living abroad.<br /><br />With the building of Ifemelu and Obinze's character, Adichie creates a storyline that holds the potential to be electric once it hits its climax, but it ends up falling flat for me due to its lack of originality. To me, this is extremely sad because for a good 3/4 of her book, Adichie makes powerful statements about race relations in America and politics in Nigeria. However, when it comes time to wrap up the loose ends of Ifemelu and Obinze's love life, she creates a weak generic ending that feels dry and so unlike what her reader's expect of her characters. In this way, I feel as if Adichie did more telling than actual showing in her book. I was truly interested in the cultural topics she spoke about, but by the end of the book, I sort of got the feeling that she could've condensed the actual love story of Ifemelu and Obinze into a mere 150 to 200 pages and written another book about her feelings on race in America/ Immigration laws in America and England/ Nigerian politics.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Nigerian culture or who wants to learn what the American or English culture looks like from a non-white immigrant's perspective. However, if you aren't interested in hearing a lot of back history to either of these culture's, I would recommend reading something else.
B001OMJGD0|3.0|The special effects are great but they forget it's the relationship between Lois and Clark that makes the movie. They had Superman looking like a creepy stalker for most of the movie. Fix this and it's a five star movie !
B003NRWW58|1.0|I was excited to hear about a spin off of my favorite TV series, Doctor Who. However, there is too much gratiutious and graphic sex and violence (like an episode about cannibals, complete with a butcher shop full of human body parts or another episode about a giant, docile extra terrestrial that is caught in a meat shop and slowly butchered alive).<br /><br />I definitely can't recommend this show to anyone.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|I'm absolutely blown away by the amount of people who would 1) bother to download something this ridiculous, 2) not comprehend that it says IT'S FAKE and only PRETENDS to hack a wi-fi network, 3) actually admit publicly that they even bothered to download this and thought it would actually work, 4) thought Amazon would ALLOW an app in the app store that actually DID hack wi-fi networks and admitted in it's description that it did so.  Come on people use a little common sense.  I did get a laugh out of reading some of the reviews though.  Unbelievable.
B003G4W49C|4.0|So, the concept is a little far-out, but Sci-fi aficionados will love that.  This book had me hooked early on, and it was<br />very hard to put it down.  I empathized with the character so much, I forgot he was a child.  The characters of Valentine and Peter are also quite well-done.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|Very facinating doc on an amazing sushi chef in a little ten seat restaurant located in the basement of a subway station in Tokyo.  He has three Michelin stars and you need to make reservations a month in advance. He truly is a Michelangelo or Van Gogh  of the culinary world. If you are a \\"foodie\\" you'll love it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love having my books ready to read, especially while traveling.<br />One of my favorite apps.  Makes it easy to get all the books I want and then store them.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Love the story line. Easy to read. Keeps you going. Hard to put down. Can't wait to read the next book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This has to be my favorite trilogy.  These books are all so very awesome!<br />I read them twice and look forward to reading them again.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Nothing truly happens for the majority of this book. The events that take place in the final third are too little, too late for a book of this size.
0399134204|2.0|This book was advertised as &#34;like new&#34; and is a torn up old book. The binding is falling apart, the pages are yellow, and there is pen ink throughout the novel. The pages are literally falling out of the book. I am very disappointed.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|this is a very good CD, if you like Rod Stewart, it is nothing exciting but just good music, sung in Rod Stewart style.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|this game is not something I would download because it does not responde a lot. but if you are bored
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have tried many weather apps-this by far the best app.  I love that you can follow the weather by the hour and up to fifteen days in advance.  The radar is great and you can see multiple locations.  Great app.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|be patient and methodical. if you get stuck leave and return later. check everything. it's  a lot of fun. i enjoyed solving the problems.
B005JABSB6|2.0|This says it is for Sharp TVs but my 80&#34; TV was on and the cheaper glasses that came with it were better than these!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is such a wonderful book. This is a five-star book all the way. I really recommend this book to people that like to read action books.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Greatest invention of the century!  It's so adorable how infants hold on to this pacifier.  Most children love monkeys and this combination makes it a win-win gift.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|I can't begin to say how much I disliked this book... I finally stopped trying to get through it about half way through. I thought it was going to be a coming of age story of these friends that have met in a youth cancer support group. But it was more of a crap youth romance book. Very cheesy and the characters are not believable or likable. Like the boy love interest likes to walk around with a cigarette in his mouth, but wont light it as a way to show the cigarette company they have no power over him. BARF. I mean they talk about that several times like he is sooo deep and pensive. This book has gotten soooo many great reviews, but this just was bad writing and a story that could have been really good, but falls way short.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This is a must have in your movie library...especially when you have grandchildren.  Great story, action, music, and vivid colors.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game is fun and addicting.  I just wish it wouldn't lock up and waste tokens.  Also more daily free tokens would be nice.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|At least it was a quick read.  Not a single orginal idea.  Everything in it was geared toward the upper middle class American traditional nuclear family.  How much of America, let alone the world, is really like that?  I support lean-in communities and so if the book helps to promote the women of the generation coming up behind me doing some of the things that Ms. Sandberg suggests, then the existence of the book and the discussions it is sparking make the book worthwhile.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I have no idea what this movie is about and never will. I was so bored after the first hour I turned it off
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I like Seth Macfarlane, not a huge fan of this film though. Was over rated. Too many celebrity references, and jokes that will age poorly in 5 years.
B000GOUMPI|5.0|This is a cherished timeless classic horror film. The cast is amazing. This is just a fun movie that I can enjoy over and over.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I loved his last album and I love listening to both when stuck in traffic going across the county and exercising.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Great Game! I bought this game for my 8 year old,  but I like playing it too! I would recommend it to anyone!
B00C061I3K|5.0|I listen to this album every day. I admittedly don't like every song on the album, but the ones I do like, I absolutely love. My favorite tracks are &#34;Instant Crush&#34; and &#34;Give Life Back to Music.&#34;
B003QSLW0K|5.0|Great movie.  Wish we had just bought it, but we generally prefer physical copies, so I guess just renting it online was for the best.  Now we know we want it when we find it on the shelves.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|The only thing I don't like about angry birds is that I keep finishiing levels, but it doesn't seem to put those completions in the one place that counts the most. Otherwise, it's a fun and challenging game.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Incredible acting, beautiful story that talks about reincarnation.<br />Very interesting dialogs. Is the kind of movies you have to watch twice.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|If you like cut the rope you will definitely like this game! Beware it is very addictive.  The puzzles make you think and the graphics are interesting.
1781162646|5.0|I started reading this book in the afternoon and had set it down a couple times to do silly stuff like cook dinner, etc. Was reading in bed and thought, I'll just stop after this chapter. But no, I couldn't stop , I had to read to the end and find out the killer. Good read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not enough rooms but a lot of fun. It had challenges but not so much that I wanted to give up.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|This album is AMAZING! I recommend this album to anyone. It is up beat and romantic.  Michael's voice is perfect!
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. My only few complaints are that they left too many questions unanswered, and there were a few chapters that really drug on with what seemed like pointless fillers. Overall excellent book. I would definitely recommend it.
1609611543|5.0|I have completely changed the way I eat thanks to this book!  And I feel so much better for it!
1878424319|5.0|This is probably the easiest self-help book I've ever read, yet it's so full of insight.  I've given copies to people I knew who were having a lot of interpersonal and emotional problems, but who were intimidated by the thought of reading some convoluted, wordy self-help guide with a lot of psychological or new age jargon.  Every one of them has embraced this book as a life guide.  I'll acknowledge that some of the agreements are pretty hard to stick to.  But nobody's perfect, and just having an awareness of the things that we do that cause us so much unnecessary suffering, shifts something in your mind and in your life.  I highly recommend this book, as well as his other book about love.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I'm hardly any critic of music but I like the new 70's style and a step away from the heavy base. Overall I'm just a Daft Punk fan and this was music that was nice to listen to.
006082543X|5.0|It's very different to most of comics you can read nowadays. A good script and a master like P. Craig Russell. Marvelous!
125000098X|5.0|Jeffrey Archer has a knack for grabbing the reader's attention and interest on the first page!  Story moves quickly, an enjoyable read.  Had read previous 2 novels in this series, but Mr. Archer informs the reader of highlights of those novels; makeing it easy to refresh one's memory. Looking forward to the next in series.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really do like it a lot! But... I don't like the fact that it is supposed to be free but once you run out of Bingo Cards you have to buy more with money. At least with other games it only makes you wait a few hours then you can play again. Not with this ):
B006G4F8OW|5.0|I can't wate to get the rest of them i hope that y'all have  the man that the cartoon was the reason that we even know about the cartoons
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like trying to earn the stars and unlock different levels. But i don't know howto earn the feathers. Overall it is fun.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|The game is okay I am guessing. I love trading card games like this. The reason I put I am guessing it is okay is because of the loading time for the kindle version.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game a lot.it is very entertaining especially for car rides. Love how you get missions and stuff.
B000U0O9FM|4.0|Unique & bizarre, dark and slightly disturbing, with a unique writing style, 'Fight Club' is a cult classic. The rest I will leave up to you, the first rule of Fight Club is...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a really fun game. I like how you can unlock different levels and earn money from flips. Although i  gets boring after a while, it is still fun.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app every night to fall asleep! It is great for meditation, relaxation, and peaceful sleeping! Definitely worth a download.
B000002GLV|5.0|JOHN GOT SOME OFF THE BEST ,IN JAZZ, TO PLAY WITH HIM. THE BEST BRINGS OUT THE BEST IN YOU.NOT YOUR TIPICAL MAYALL ALBUM.
B002UNMW7O|4.0|been lookin around for ever finally got on here ordered it got it a couple days later and had not a one problem with it love the movie could watch over and over never gets old and was for used just like new
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|I thought that this movie was a big surprise. I did not expect to like it as much as I did. Although I am rather confused over how the Giants got their offspring, being that I did not see a single female giant and there were plenty of ginats to go around. Other than that. I liked it and it was a good change for a movie.
B007HACDLK|1.0|Seems like over half of the book was missing. E Ben with the add on was too too short for a book. I was dissapointed
193700788X|5.0|I've followed this series from the beginning and wondered how it was going to end. I was worried that the only \\"happy\\" ending would have to compromise Sookie's sense of self and would make her into a victim more than a survivor. I'm so impressed that Ms. Harris avoided that! The ending was absolutely perfect. Sookie will be OK. No matter what happens, Sookie will be OK. I could not have asked for (or dreamed of) anything better. Yeah!<br /><br />This also leaves an opening for an interesting result from Niall's \\"gift.\\" I once worried Ms. Harris by asking about the gestation period for an elf/human baby (I misspoke, I was trying to be circumspect about my idea of \\"the gift\\" and was trying to ask how long it would take for a 5/8 elf/human baby to be born.) That could have ended disastrously. I'm so glad that the way things stand now, it would be a happy ending for that thread of the story, if what I suspect is true.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|It's a more simple and nicer story than the movie. A nice relaxing read. Have your kids read it too.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Each level can be attempted quickly-good for car trips, waiting rooms, etc. Even if a level isn't completed perfectly, it's possible to advance. Sound can be annoying, but can be turned off. Some tasks are almost intuitively easy, while others can be frustrating. May want to disable ability to buy solving hints if kids have access to the game.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I found this book fascinating and didn't want it to  end.. I was amazed at the author's honesty and often found myself laughing at her innocence about what she set out to do.  At the same time I was awed by her inner strength and determination. The writing was vivid and my feet were hurting just from reading about her suffering. I was also so glad to find the brief prolog and update as to what happened after the hike was over.
B004GXZ69W|3.0|The device works well in relieving stress on the hand. Unfortunatley, it failed after only six months usage. Poor design I guess.
1616550414|5.0|The definitive text on Zelda mythology and history. The extra content and all the concept art makes this a real delight
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed playing. Didn't take long to get through all 8 levels but I enjoyed every minute of it. More please.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie was better than I expected! It had a pretty good story line! And it had some pretty funny parts!
B008JFUPK8|2.0|Zack Snyder (300, Watchman) did an honest job in trying to reinvent the franchise, however he fell short in the most important area, the story.  Man of Steel had no real plot that develops. I don't mind adjusting the lore (SPOILER: Jonathan Kent dies in a twister?), but above all else you need a story that engages me into the characters.  David S. Goyer (Threshold, Flashforward) story that was penned by himself and Synder lacked any real depth or for that matter originality.<br /><br />I am a huge Superman fan (from Kirk Allen to Dean Cain), and I could even appreciate the better points of Superman Returns a few years back with Brandon Routh as the alien from Krypton which also had major issues, but this film had no \\"WOW\\" Superman moments. It was like watching 300 (nothing but fighting) meets Transformers (hard to follow who was hitting who) meets Cloverfield (the camera shook even on the most intimate close-ups) meets the remake of Godzilla (what's the point?).<br /><br />Now, the good things I saw were actually for once Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Les Miserables) was properly cast as the father of Kal El (Superman), Jor El. Although a short part, his pushy nature of guiding his son as well as the earthlings seem every sincere and more so on the scenes where he puts his baby son in the spaceship that takes him to a strange new world.<br /><br />Okay, Henry Cavill (The Immortals, Stardust) does an honest attempt at playing the American Icon even though he is British. He seems sincere in his convictions and honest to the character. Defiantly a good looking man, but again he as an actor and as a character had very little to stretch his acting muscles on.<br /><br />Amy Adams (Enchanted, Monster) as Lois Lane, although small in part is always a delight to watch. Once again, she didn't have a lot to work with, but what she did with what she had was good. Amy is a far more talented performer than what they gave her to do here in the movie. Another good, short but memorable performance came from Christopher Maloni (Oz, Law & Order) who plays a military sergeant who is the first one to believe and trust in Superman besides Lois of course, weirdly enough.<br /><br />Kevin Costner (Dances With Wolves, The Untouchables) as Jonathan Kent and Diane Lane (Perfect Storm, Jumper) as Martha Kent were perfectly cast if not for the re-inventing of the famed Superman lore. Diane was amazing sincere and real while Costner was the most fatherly I have ever seen him perform.<br /><br />General Zod played like a punked up with steroids version of Adam Ant was performed by Michael Shannon (Take Shelter, The Iceman). Although he looked menacing and shouted well, he didn't have the gravitas as an actor to play the broadly proud and menacing personality that is the character. He just came off like a big bully with special powers. Weak of spirit of conviction  if strong in his efforts of pointless violence.<br /><br />The film is too dark to be a Superman film. It is not triumphant and proud and downplays the grandeur of what the American Icon has always represented. I hope Synder does not direct the sequel if there is one and coupled with the gloomy cinematography Amir Mokri (Pacific Heights, Queen's Logic), the not so interesting redesigning of the costumes by Michael Wilkinson (Sucker Punch, 300) and the bold and broad but un-heroic score of Hans Zimmer (The Lion king, Pirates of the Caribbean ), I really hope it doesn't destroy the DC Line of super heroes. Although The dark Knight series did okay (Heath Leadger in the second was my favorite even without Batman in it), I just wish that kids could walk out of Superhero movies these days feeling like a superhero themselves and having fun. Like the Avengers film! There were no claps, cheers, boos or applauds during this film. Superman Return's had that and I won't begin to mention the standing cheers of crowds at Christopher Reeve's Superman: The Movie directed by Richard Donner.  I was more than disappointed and I was really looking forward to this one! Go see Star Trek: Into Darkness - it is a far far far far better film (thick with story)!ted and I was really looking forward to this one! Go see Star Trek: Into Darkness - it is a far far far far better film (thick with story)!
193700788X|1.0|I have been a devoted reader to the Sookie Stackhouse series.  I always look forward to the next book and I was hesitant to even begin reading Dead Ever After because that would mean it truly was over.  Apparently, Charlaine Harris has given up and was finished writing the book before she even started.  The book is full of grammatical errors and a lot of talking in circles.  I can not tell you how many times I had to reread sentences because they just grammatically did not make sense.  Throughout the book everyone keeps referencing her yard and how bountiful it is.  The yard had NOTHING to do with the story line in the book.  I continually waited in hopes that there would be some magical link to Sookie, but nothing.<br />The series did not end how I expected it to, but then again I do not think Charlaine Harries did the series or Sookie Stackhouse any justice.  It seems she just wanted to end the series in any way possible.  There are still many loose ends and questions left.<br />Don't waste your time.  This is the worst book in the entire series.  It is clear that Charlaine Harris has lost her passion for the Sookie Stackhouse series and it is such a disappointment.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|It was exceptionally good for a soap opera and very well done in all respects. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys English drama.
B008Y7DWC4|1.0|I stopped watching the movie about 20 minutes into it.  It was so bad, it was almost comical.<br />The movie looks like it was produced in the late '70's or early 80's and the special effects look as though the technology to produce them went even further back.<br />The only scary thing about this movie is that it's still around!<br />If you're looking to be scared, don't bother watching this movie.  If you're looking for a good chuckle due to the awful story line and laughable special effects (especially by today's standards), by all means, knock yourself out.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|We were greatly impressed at the ability of the producer/director to put this book into a movie. They did a great job of showing what happens when government gets too powerful.<br />Highly recommend this movie.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Small, powerful, does as advertised. For people with all android devices its still annoying that these things have to have an apple port or the charging method they use is for apple devices even if its not stated at such. That being said it is the best dual port car charger out there.
B0038LB4TE|4.0|bit of a slow start but gets very exciting and full of tension. I like Jack Reacher books, thanx Lee Childs
B0096MM9GG|1.0|I cant see any thing in game as road imagine  because black screen fix it asap ubisoft good game but more control and black screen
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game!  It is a challenging puzzler that is extremely fun and rewarding.  My only complaint is the lack of levels and horrible graphics (at least on the kindle fire.)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read all three books. I couldn't put either of them down- if you compare books to food- this was not a snack, it was a hearty meal. A delicious hearty meal.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|if you haven't watched this film, do yourself the pleasure. not too often will a movie stick with you days after viewing it.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|this product is great, great sound and visual... my friends are asking me to lend it... maybe the DVD :D
1439153663|4.0|Kathleen Grissom created a wonderful piece of historical fiction with THE KITCHEN HOUSE. You could see she spent a lot of time researching the history of the time period. You felt you were among the scenes from Williamsburg to the plantation to the slaves quarters.  It was a good tact to use two different characters as the voices of the book. Kudos to a newly found author whose future works I will look forward to reading.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy way to access books fast. Quality books. Pretty good prices. I didn't really use it but from what I saw it was a good app.
B006HGXGWU|4.0|A young film auteur, Mr. Nichols, gets married and witnesses the beginning of the Crisis in 2008.  Being a good artist, he locks in on the theme of his next film, the condition of the responsible male as head of family ahead of major discontinuity.  Whether or not the discontinuity is real or imaginary becomes rather demanding on the disappointed public of this film, but if we agree upon the theme as just sketched, this becomes a secondary aspect.<br /><br />The great: The theme + Acting & staging + The depiction of horizontal relationships in a flattened society;<br />The average: The ending--a surer narrative hand would have been required to bring the ending to something more of us could agree on, it bears the mark of the author's age;<br />Nothing below average to report.<br /><br />I place this film in the same class as [[ASIN:B00062134E Time of the Wolf]] and [[ASIN:B005TJ7EFG Melancholia]].  Haneke though is the gold standard of them all, or what Nichols is gonna be while he grows up.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I. watch weather in more than one city. The time of day update is great too. Thank you for the videos also.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris' story is the story of a true American icon. Not perfect, not simple. This country lives another day because of men just like him.
B001NA6096|4.0|Two people meet on a train. They spend an evening together in Vienna, knowing they only have 12 hours. Everything is twinged with a sense of evaporating time, impossibility, and longing. A beautiful romance that captures the feeling of momentary romance in your 20s and how fleeting moments can be, but how strong connections can occur even in fleeting moments.
B004G600A4|2.0|I love the movie itself, but the first copy I bought  would barely play. The screen would get pixelated and then skip about 3-5 minutes ahead. This happened all throughout the movie. Contacted the seller and got a replacement and that copy did the same thing. Both CDs were clean with no scratched. Not sure what the problem with them was.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Prety good story and fun to read.<br />It can get a little complicated and mind boggling but just like in movies you just go along with it and don't question too much.<br /><br />Good book, fun story
B00D7NRHX0|4.0|I enjoyed this a lot. It's not a shoot 'em up space-ship type sci-fi movie. More on the lines of Ursula LeGuin.<br /><br />Such a crazy idea and cool special effects make up for the main actor's lame voice-over and inexperienced performance. Plus, more Kirsten Dunst! She's under-used here, and she's always great whatever she does. The visuals make this film worth a second look. Really different.
1594488886|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a genius. His books take us from the comfort of our lives to see the many faceted sides of living in Afghanistan. The Kite Runner focused on two boys stuck in this oppressive society, and now we follow two unlikely woman who's lives intersect and change forever. It's a book of loyalty, love and sacrifice. Brutal, at some times too hard to read, it's a necessary book to understand the plight of those compelled to live as objects rather than humans in their horrific world.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Great app. Especially since I got it for free. It shows the charge percentage for the battery and will also tell you how much time you have left.
B000002G8H|5.0|His music has gone to another level.  he is like a fine wine, it just keeps getting better and more refined with age.  I have been a fan since the '60's and haven't been disappointed yet.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I had seen the trailers and thought it just might have a chance. The design of the film is the same as the original Wizard of Oz meaning it starts in Kansas... black in white, real life, nothings perfect world with personal relationships at bay. Then comes a Tornado (it seems this is the only entrance into the land of Oz). From here on, the real story begins. Bright colors, bigger than life world, where life is simplistic and funny and dangerous all at the same time. The one question that I kept asking myself was... &#34;How does this amateur magician turn into this great and so powerful Oz?&#34; The answer is quite clear in the movie and it is very believable. A great film for all ages. I enjoyed it so much I plan of purchasing the 3D version for my collection.
1608871517|5.0|I'm a huge MJ fan and enjoyed all the little insites to his clothes.  After reading the book, I could appreciate what pains MJ went thru for his fabulous clothes.  Michael Bush seemed to be a true friend to Michael Jackson.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Got confusing at times, but came together at the end.  Good cast, costumes and effects.  Several of the characters played multiple parts, and they were pretty easy to spot.  However, when reading the credits at the end there were a few surprises.
1465001107|2.0|Disappointed in the picture selection and quality.  Not the quality of pictures I'm used to seeing in a Michael Jackson calendar.
B00821OX98|4.0|Overall it has a good plot allthough not really original.  I don't like the cheezy background music.  Sometimes it can get irritating.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have been reading the wheel of time since I was 12. Over the years I waited on the most recent installments and gradually drifted away but I picked the series back up again two years ago and reread all the old books through this final book. Now, there are a TON of threads in RJ's pattern, and a few of them do seem to be tied up somewhat hastily and as an afterthought as Brandon Sanderson attempts to weave then numerous plot lines all together into one great final pattern. But all the important plot lines are satisfactorily and skillfully wrapped up and the end is just what I would have hoped for ... except there is one little change to Rand that I'm nt a fan of,but you might like it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Page turner!! This book hooked me from the start! Exciting, smart, full of twists, definitely exceded my expectations! A must read!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Any body who saw the movie should definitely read the book. If your struggle with any mental health issues or self doubt, this a real good feel good book.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Great graphics, great gameplay, and fun to play. Like playing COD in the old days.  Also like the historical information contained in the game.  Keep up the good work.
0345803485|3.0|Very interesting hope the next 2 is up to par and is as readable as the first book.  Really want to know who some of the characters are
B00BU2SIW4|5.0|Great album, great band. A step back to the sounds that made them what the are today. A band simply is not supposed to sound this good on thier 13th album in a career that spans over 3 decades.
1451697686|5.0|Bea's story is captivating.  She goes from living a life of typical (an perhaps overboard) American consumerism with a big house, two SUVs and LOTS OF STUFF to a small well appointed house, one modest car, and 80% LESS STUFF.  Her family now generates 1 quart of waste a year- this includes recycling and landfill waste!!  To say her story is inspirational is an understatement.  This book has completely changed the way I look at my habits, my home, and my entire world.  Bea somwhow is able to get across a strong environmental, health, and simplicity messge without being &#34;preachy&#34;.  She doesn't beat you over the head with her philosophy, yet somehow it changes your outlook.  I am implementing many of the practices (slowly but surely) that she mentions in her book, and I'm already feeling like I'm making a difference for myself, my family, and our planet.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|I used this lens filter on a recent trip and it worked as advertised, I got some great shots underwater with it and would recomend it or any other red filter for this GoPro camera.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Enjoyed the plot twists and story line surprises of this season. The parallel worlds are great. Episodes are all great and keep me wanting to watch (often more than the one episode I had planned to take in for the evening).
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Pretty much the same kind of humor that was in Knocked Up. Has it's moments where jokes either go over your head or make you feel old should be a comedy/drama
B007QJ8VBI|4.0|I was surprised by the storyline as to how the playboy and the seemingly innocent are played. A bit risqu&eacute; for the times. Classic in the way the two characters intimate moments together were handled (don't need to see it to know what was going on...)<br />I suggest this as a great date night movie with a bowl of popcorn!
B000VYNYN0|5.0|Has it's moments when it's a little bit gory. The acting isn't great but if you haven't seen it by now and don't know that already, this probably isn't for you. It's pretty much a so bad it's good kind of movie. It has a cult following for a reason.
B00006AW63|5.0|This version is the best with great acting and lots of action. Kids love the plot and it reinforces the concept of good over evil.
B00BF11STU|4.0|decent movie was pretty long though. Took very long to get to it's climax, but then again it is based on a true story
0790731509|5.0|&#34;What we have here is a failure to communicate.&#34; If you haven't seen it, then see it - for me it was definite must buy.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|The special effects and the story were great but somehow this movie was just bad.  Some of the lines were really lame and James Franco never got beyond playing the part rather than convincing the audience that he was the character. Not a good recipe for the leading actor. The three leading women, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, and  Michelle Williams, however were all outstanding, simply brilliant.  But still, don't waste your time or money on this one.
630460291X|5.0|It's a Costner big screen, period movie. A definite must see if you're into period movies. Costner doesn't get them all right, but he always seems to nail the true big screen period movies.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I love this song and ie heard the whole cd so i plan to purchase it! there music is funky and alive!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Wonderful. This is a great drama. The characters are superb and the dialogue is both heartwarming and humorous. Make sure u watch season one and two first!  Lol
B00CAJP0ZO|4.0|The music is just what you would expect from him and also having a bit of songs like &#34;where is the love&#34; it has good party tracks and has kept me playing it in the car when i want to hear some upbeat music!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft but it can be bland to some people. But everyone one should trey it.the price is outrageous. If you chill and creative go for it.<br /><br />  @chic reviewer
B0002KQNJU|4.0|What can you say, one of the best Vampire movies ever to hit the big screen. It is a masterpiece of film making especially from the late 60's. See it for a scary fun good time.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|this is a budget good horror movie, good director, write, good FX, style Shaun of the dead, so funny, bunch of retards kids fight against couple rednecks,,, so funny, so funny, good for the entire family, kids 14 up, buy in bluray, rent it, keep it, make copy, grab your popcorn and enjoy!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book, while slow to start, gets going very quickly and is a can't put down read until you finish. Buy it, read it, love it!
B000002O4X|5.0|This soundtrack arrived within 3 days and was in perfect condition--factory sealed, not a knockoff. It is an outstanding value.
B00CWVFPGO|1.0|My husband wanted to watch this movie, I should have trusted my instincts and saved my $4.99! I would not recommend watching until it comes to TV.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|waste of money and 3 hours!!!!  all over the place and in 2 of the time frames featured, we could not understand a damn thing they said
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I love it! I am a girl and I wish they would make more women's watches likes this one. Good quality and does not lose time.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I got this for my kids, and they love angry birds and this is their new favorite one to play
B0059XTTW8|4.0|gary oldman is such a professional...can not believe hes has not won an oscar..he really becomes smiley in this, and ever though I have read the book and seen the other movie, I really loved this version...it is the best yet
0529064847|1.0|I was not happy with this.  I wanted the New American Standard Bible.  I probably will not use it.  I will give it to someone.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Here's a further opportunity to appreciate how Quentin Tarantino makes his art. The long, slow building of tension in scenes that last half an hour or more until they erupt in unbelievable violence. The celebration of revenge. Jamie Fox is fine as the lead, Django. Christoph Waltz's Dr. King Schultz is a surprisingly sympathetic character as the man who purchases Django, and teaches him to become a bounty hunter. Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant as Calvin J. Candie, the evil white plantation owner who has his slaves fight each other to the death for sport, and gets wind of Django's plan to rescue his wife from Candie's plantation. Samuel L. Jackson is almost unrecognizable as Stephen, the ever-loyal servant to Candie. Long, long conversation, realization of the stakes, and then, boom! Tarantino borrows cheesiness from spaghetti Westerns, but manages to infuse the predictability and B-movie overkill with a kind of dignity. In this remarkable feat, he deserves his reputation as one of the best directors working.
B005HSL626|5.0|It was fun while I had it, I just hoped that it had more juice, more action, but it was great
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Lots of wonderful stuff in this movie with lots of issues to explore, around the making of Psycho. How was Hitchcock going to top himself after North by Northwest? (Vertigo, well respected today, was considered a dud.) How was going to adapt to, indeed, get ahead of, the mores of the new decade? How creepy to women was he? How does jealousy play out in a marriage like his? And guess what, his wife was a very important player in his art, doing a lot of the editing. Performances are top-notch, with Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren, and Scarlett Johannsen as Janet Leigh (really spectacular--I had not really appreciated her beauty until this film.) How did Hitchcock get ahead of the censors?  And of course you have to revisit Psycho after seeing this movie. Pretty enthralling.
B004VMVTNU|3.0|I had seen better alarm clocks out there, although this one was good it wasn't the best one you can have
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This is a movie that I had no idea what it was about, but I kept hearing about it. My sister and her husband took a rare night out to see it. A good friend shared his appreciation of Jennifer Lawrence. So yeah, I rented it on Amazon, with pretty much zero idea of the plot. So a Philadelphia guy has his mental problems, and gets out of the looney bin after almost killing his wife's lover, and moves back in with Mom & Dad. Dad is a relapsed bookie played by Robert de Niro. Dad becomes needy as he wants Pat (Bradley Cooper) around to watch the Eagles games with him; he believes Pat gives him good luck. Mutual friends introduce Pat to Tiffany (Lawrence), another nutcase. There is immediate attraction, but Pat is still obsessed with his wife. Tiffany persuades Pat to enter a dance concert with her. Love is sublimated, until the end. You can guess. Yep, tears in spite of yourself. Well done.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Loved the game it was great and very entertaining. Which that they keep making more if them and ad free
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book has blown me away. I sincerely hope Ryan takes the time to deliver a sophomore effort that rivals this work of genius. To hell with agents and publishers who just want their pockets fattened by the swift delivery of the next one thousand pages. Take your time Ryan. Listen to your song.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This is one of the best apps out there to know what music is playing from tv shows to movies
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Very touching, love the relationship between Dustin and Tom. Great story. A classic for all time. One of Dustin's best acting jobs.
031603441X|5.0|Mr. Richards relates his unbelievable life in easy to access and down to earth terms as if he truly remembers intimate details from being a youngster through all the trials that form his rock star years. After he gets us through his upbringing it's as if being a stoner and alcohol-fueled orchestrator of the greatest rock band in the world is transpiring right before the eyes of the reader. Keith and his co-writer, James Foz, take us on a journey unparalleled by other bio's I have read. This book is a front row ticket to the life through the eyes of the guy who had the best seat in the house for Rolling Stone, the band whom are still around after over fifty years of history-making success. As in all great reads, 100 pages in I was hooked.
B002DJSBMA|5.0|I recommend it to everyone...it was a beautiful movie !<br /><br />talking about strong and honest people ! teaching us all to be honest and strong
B000FBJF3M|4.0|I picked up this book because I am looking forward to the film adaption starring Emily Browning and Kit Harrington. I am an italian-american that has visited Rome and Capri and consumed so much history about Pompeii from the science to the art. After reading this book, I can assure you that Robert Harris did so much research to tell this incredible tale. He includes things that one would think only historians would ever dream of knowing, and writes the story beautifully. After reading this novel, honestly want to hop on a plane and visit Pompeii. It also made me interested in history and despite the semi-predictable ending, I would definitely recommend this book to people of all ages - especially teenagers wanting a romantic glimpse into this time (although the writing is very adult, I myself am 21 at the time of this review).
B00BMUVUZG|3.0|This book is the fourth book of the Theodore Boone Series. The series is all about Theo who is the only child of two lawyers. His father is an estate lawyer and his mother is a divorce lawyer. Theo loves the law and plans to be a famous trial lawyer some day. He loves the law so much that he has his own small &#34;law office&#34; within his parents' offices. He gives advice and helps out friends as much as he can.<br /><br />In this fourth book of the series, Theo is faced with a problem that has something to do with budgets. He is very sad to learn that budget cuts are forcing his school to make certain changes. But, as there are cutbacks on one hand, the town council is considering voting on a project that will cost $200 million dollars. To make things much more worrisome, Theo's friend Hardie asks him whether the government can simply take the land that has been in his family for almost a century just to build something.<br /><br />As he and his friends are spending some time fishing on the property that Hardie's family calls their own, his dog Judge gets brutally attacked by men who claim to be surveyors. They even shoved one of the boys and was rough with Theo himself. Judge is lucky to be alive and Theo's parents take the men to Animal Court for cruelty.<br /><br />Theo has to explain about eminent domain and I have to admit that the explanation is clear and easy to understand especially for young children. The concept of acting on something that kids passionately care about is well presented.<br /><br />However, the story starts out rather slowly. It only picks-up after an incident at the Quinn property which is pretty far into the book.
193700788X|4.0|It was a good book, I think all loose ends got tied up.  I am a little sad that this is the last Sookie Stackhouse book,  I did enjoy reading the series.

B003B1X80Y|5.0|This movie is a tear jerker. But a great one. It has it all. Sad, happy, romantic, Wonderful story.<br />I would recommend this to everyone. Something for all. Not for kids, they would be bored. The picture is clear as is the sound.

B009KY5OGC|5.0|It amazed my to learn the extent our government went to to so all aquire land from the Naive American Indian.  The lies and the terrable treatment of the indians and just how inhumainly people treat each other.  What we as American did to the Indians was no worse or even worse than  what Hitler is the the Jewish people.  The book is extreamly eye opening and informative.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This movie is awesome. It's suspenseful and keeps you watching. I am a Star Trek nerd, and this did it justice.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Poor execution? Great cast, great makeup and special effects, but the storyline failed to relevantly connect all 6 parts. What was with the boogieman? How did the actions of other people transform their characters throughout the course of time? I failed to see (as did many others) the point of many of the backstories and characters. What was the relevance of the song? 3 hours later, and the plot still eludes me.
0439023521|4.0|great book. a little violent, but it helps with the social commentary. Great first book in the series. Would recommend
B004HWT6DO|5.0|the writing, directing, music, performances are all compelling.  i highly recommend this film.  sorkin is a genius and creatively tackles this true story impressively.
B000957O7S|5.0|Cute, funny and smart. Totally relatable. This review needs more words, so I'm going to keep typing. Would recommend this to others
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|A lot of action - Plot was a bit thin! Bruce did a good job as usual with a nice introduction to his son. Too bad the story line did not support the quality of acting he is capable of. The movie was too short and a bit shallow compared with the others in the McClain series.
1451695187|5.0|Like the author, I too have a scientific education and background. It is difficult to open up to other options. Real eye opener to read of his experience and to ponder what is really out there.
143911000X|5.0|The bro code. I still read it every now and then. If you like Barney's humor, you will like this book.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I wasn't expecting a comedy - of sorts. It was enjoyable and had a little of everything: action, love story, bad guys, etc. I gave it a five because it was overall entertaining and fun.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|It is fun to see what they can do.  It makes me and my friends laugh. good when i'm board

B008GXHOFW|3.0|With open world attributes this game is a new twist on an old topic with an entire city to web sling around in and an exciting storyline it had a few high and low points but it stands out for sure
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book, having just finished a very stressful year, was extremely uplifting and really gives you a sense of how good people can be.<br />I give this book 5 stars because of how life-like it is. Not to mention that this book is funny, sad, happy... everything. It is a very good book and I suggest that if you are even thinking about reading this book, that you do.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|When I first saw this game I thought it was stupid then I said let me give it a try I downloaded and now I just can't wait till the 30 seconds are over for another coin I find myself constantly coming back to tee his game it is very fun and I enjoy it very much I wish they would come out with a coin dozer 2
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second book to the &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; trilogy was a good read.  I would recommend this trilogy only for adults.
0061684384|5.0|This is a very creative book....I can't get enough of how genuine the subjects were written.  I found to have alot of common ground and a great understanding of where she came from, after reading it.  A Treasure for sure.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I found &#34;The Hunger Games Trilogy&#34; to be very captivating.  I especially could not put down the second book.  I would definitely recommend this trilogy.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I must admit that I was intimidated by the previews and didn't see this movie until recently, and I have now seen it three times and read the book (and will be reading much more from David Mitchell soon!).  How people feel about this movie will define them in my eyes, and I have little patience for those who didn't have the patience to embrace this movie (and novel) soup to nuts.<br />The pacing of the film works on so many levels and I find it fascinating how six such fundamentally different stories (historical drama, tragedy, suspense thriller, comedy, sci-fi, and post apocalyptic adventure) are interwoven and connected to evoke and develop the recurring themes.  The cast is uniformly outstanding - several could have been nominated for Oscars in both leading and supporting roles in the same movie! (Tom Hanks as Zachry or as Dr. Goose; Jim Broadbent as Timothy Cavendish or as Vivian Ayres; Ben Wishaw and Doona Bea are both luminous and heartbreaking in their starring segments and Hugo Weaving and Hugh Grant made the most of their multiple supporting roles.<br />This is a challenging movie, but ultimately an extremely rewarding one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is unlike any book I ever read.  It was a very captivating story.  I would recommend this book only to adults.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|Queens set up in wrong position, white on black, black on white. Difficult to distinguish bishops from pawns. One bishop began moving horizontally in the middle of the game! Deleted app. during second game.
B001XV09UG|1.0|It was the weirdest movie ever. Started off excited because it was a movie I couldn't watch when I was younger. Lost interest in the middle.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|I hope Arnold continues making movies and improves now that he is out of political office. He should stick to the action adventure pictures he made in the past.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Interesting research & conclusions.  Very informative but somewhat repetitive. Well written and easy to understand for the general public.  Definitely read if you think you may be gluten-intolerant or you are a wheat lover.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun little mahjong game. For a free app, it's a great little time waster/passer with quite a few different configurations and levels for each one. I'm enjoying it, you will too.
B0087X728K|5.0|keeps my expensive cpu running good n cool even under extreme stress ...so far i love it and would recommend it.
B001E75QH0|2.0|the sound and the quality of picture was not as expected as other DVDs could this be a older version...
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Round three of exploring E. L. James. By now great regret at ever starting. A flimsy excuse to sell three books instead of one. You get the idea of what Grey is like. You don't need page after page or book after book to repeat it. The trilogy is like turning a one hour tv show (really about 35 minutes without commercials) into a three hour movie without adding any real content. I find the main character disgusting and that doesn't change for me, even as I find out why. Any ultimate redeeming qualities don't undo all that happened to get you there. You also feel sorry for the main female character that she was so weak as to tolerate so much. I'd hate to think that there are abused women reading this and thinking that ultimately it will all work out. It doesn't. And don't make it into &#34;this is what she wanted or needed.&#34; It's beyond that to abuse. Unlike this completely unbelievable resolution, abusers do not change and she should have run from him early.
B003FFEX8C|1.0|Why did they make this. At one point did anyone say man this is gonna be great? Why o why.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Again I was reading to explore the genre and the writer. Certainly I did not find it pleasurable. I could find the kinky sex easily on the internet without having to wade through so much. The only thing worse than reading one book of her work is two or three.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Awesome book, I loved every minute and read it in a couple days cause I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to the next installment.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Sure didn't merit a trilogy. I read just to understand what all the hoopla was about. I found it dark to the point of being beyond any credibility. At times it seemed like nothing but a flimsy story thrown together to allow a lot of kinky sex to be written about and legitimized to regular bookshelves instead of porn.
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|Good way to keep track of what is going on overhead. A little difficult to get around, but can be mastered with a little use.

159463176X|5.0|This is such a hard book to rate. Khaled Hosseini set such a high bar for himself with his previous two books, both are in my Top 10 books of all time. This book, while good, certainly doesn't live up to that standard. I don't know if I would have liked it more had my expectations not been so high but unfortunately they were. The majority of this novel flows wonderfully from generation to generation, integrating characters that appear only briefly in other chapters showing what a small world this really is. Then there are a few small chapters towards the end that left me wondering why they were included at all (the Thalia, Markos sections to be precise). One thing I do enjoy about Hosseini's novels as that they may not have a happy ending but they certainly have a satisfying one and this novel is no exception.
B00AYM6JFO|3.0|I love Willie Nelson...and thought even his latest song duo would be on it...but it<br />wasn't! (Should have checked the list of songs...huh!!) But it just wasn't his best.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun game cuz there's always something new to figure out. a great puzzle game for the mind.
B000I9YX06|3.0|This movie starts out really well, but takes a turn for the painfully stupid in the last 35 or 40 minutes.<br /><br />I suppose the deeper philosophical issues were too subtle, so they had to turn it into another shallow Hollywood special effects showcase. A little Terminator, a little Independence Day, and very little of Asimov to be seen anywhere.
B000003CMB|5.0|Every once in a while something magical happens....This is it!  A fantastic collection with a truly &#34;live&#34; feel to the efforts and touches the band puts into these performances!  The whole album flows, and contains perhaps half of the songs they are best known for.  A great starter album, or finisher, but if you own one ABB album, it should be this one.  If you like Southern rock, and enjoy Lynyrd Skynyrd or Black Crows, try this out too.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />British
B00338QENI|5.0|The family background story seemed unimportant compared to the story of her cells.  I know a scientist who uses her cells even now.
1844256383|4.0|very well done.  photos are excellent.  technical information well explained. a good investment. a very good value at a reasonable price
B003G4W49C|5.0|Excellent book. Very well worth reading. Sci fi at it's best.  A book that is hard to put down.  Veriy
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I really didn't expect this could come close to the Ring Trilogy but I was pleasantly surprised.<br />I love all things mythical. It was great to have some original characters and new ones. The visual effects are great.  When I read the original book I ate and barely slept until I had finished it.  Amazon's price was also a good thing.  I have U Verse and movie prices are $5.00 and $6.00. I loved that I got paid for watching on Amazon.<br /><br />The movie was great and can't wait the next one.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I really like this CD a lot.  It's kind of old but..... I still really like it!  I listen to it often.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|its a good game. it would be a better game if it was quicker, but all in all a very satisfying game
B00AECGQF2|5.0|With only six people to style with it kept me busy for a great amount of time! Of course there's the exception where you have endless possibilities of hair styles, and it's better when you can take pics to save your creations. I wish this app would be a bit cheaper, maybe around 99&cent; or $1.99, but overall it's one of those apps you can play with all time without getting bored. I recommmend this app to anybody ^^
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|not. what I thought it would be.... but now that I have it I love the game been playing non stop since I got it. great game to play when u have time to waste.
B0018QOIXU|2.0|I really wanted to like this, but I don't.  I think it's the squeaking of her voice in every song.  It was annoying.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just love MINECRAFT.It is the best game ever when I was first fighting Creepers I had to get pigs<br />and practice on them
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|After seeing the film in theaters, I was shocked by the quality of the music. I sat through the credits generally pleased by the well written plot and dynamic characters, but utterly engrossed in the music of the ending credits. Giacchino arranged an beautiful rendition of the original star trek theme.
B004WR125O|5.0|Super fast shipping. Item look like new. If they were not tell me it is used, then I say it new. Working perfectly for the less than 20 dollar.<br />Overall, I is a great buy.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|it is wonderful.  when i want to look at my pics i can any time.  I can easily move them from my gallery to my drop box.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|A very easy to play game.  No frills, but works great on my Kindle Fire.  Can't beat the cost ($0.00).  Fun to play and almost addictive.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I simply enjoyed the entire trilogy.  I read for entertainment and relaxation but I felt enlightened by this series as well.  It really speaks to you about government, freedom, control and rebellion.  Highly recommend.
B000PWQPAC|5.0|This takes place in Japan 2034, a few years after S.A.C. ends and Motoko leaves Section 9. Togusa is now the leader of Section 9, and I'm happy about that because he has always been one of my favorite characters. You can really feel his struggle to balance work and family with his new position. Not going to spoil anything but there is a scene where I was actually tensed up and holding my breath, and it deals with Togusa and Batou. As usual all the voice actors do a great job and the animation is solid. Not sure if the frame rate is choppy or it was just my xbox 360 but there was flickering every now and then.<br /><br />The story itself is good but takes a good chunk of the movie to get rolling. I'm not saying it needs action all the time, because we're talking about Ghost in the Shell here and if you know anything about the series is that it is VERY dialogue heavy and requires your attention to understand what's going on. It was good seeing the Tachikomas again, although it felt forced like they just threw them in there for the sake of it. Overall the movie was enjoyable and if you like the tv show then you will like this movie!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|I tried to like this movie but the fact is Tom Cruise is not the right person for the role.
0439023491|4.0|Sequels rarely live up to their debuts, but this was just as good as the first book. It adds a solid piece to the series.
0061353248|5.0|I got addicted from the first pages!<br />Really interesting facts about us, people and the society, are unveiled in this book - definitely worth reading!
0316223239|5.0|While I don't think the book was perfect, I really appreciate the unique take on a story that we've heard a few too many times in recent years. This really pulls the reader in to a terrible situation and gives us a way to even start to try to grasp how someone might feel.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|FINALLY!<br />Let me start by saying this. I can't stand \\"professional\\" critics. They act like they're sooo super smart. No pun. I don't think they know what good and bad movies are. 90% of the time we totally disagree. Don't listen to them. Judge for yourself.<br /><br />This was awesome. Best Superman movie I've seen. And yes, I grew up in the Christopher Reeves era. I still enjoy Superman 2(the first was always just ok to me). But never has Superman reached his potential on film. Not like other superheroes have. Until now. There's no comparison. I don't feed on nostalgia. I still love my old classics but some newer interpretations are simply better. This had a good story and nicely paced origin retelling, great comicbook style action(about time) and I love the smart way of how Clark Kent can maintain his secret identity. They did it also in Smallville. Makes more sense. For the critics and few other naysayers, I don't think they are or ever will be ready for a true Superman movie like we just got. Want to live in the past, live in the past, the 70s/80s. I prefer this version.<br /><br />No one has to agree with me. This is my firm opinion and I will continue to stand by mine. Very pleased. That is all. No description needed. See it for yourself.
0743454537|4.0|One of Picoult's more moving novels, this one really pulls at the heart strings. This is pure curl up and cry reading that leaves you feeling full and content.
1451620829|5.0|This is a five star read. The book is well written and engaging. The story flows nicely, and there are no parts that drag. As far as the content of the book, that's another thing entirely. I'm kind of sorry I gave this guy my money buying the book. I came away feeling really sorry for Paul and Gene, firstly for having to put up with his and Ace's antics in the seventies, and secondly for getting a tell all written about them after giving a washed up Peter $40,000 a show! Peter did not learn any humility at all. In the seventies, he was throwing furniture out of hotel windows and breaking down hotel room walls, all while shoveling a steady stream of coke up his nose. That alone should have gotten him booted LONG before he was actually fired. He winds up blowing $12,000,000 and is left playing second rate clubs that he continued to feel he was too good for. Then, Paul and Gene offer him a second chance to restore himself to his former fame and earn some money, and he gets mad because after being gone from then band for nearly 20 years, he wasn't restored to an equal partner in profits and merchandising. He calls Gene and Paul out for being money hungry, and then ends his almost life long friendship with Ace because Ace was making more money. News flash Peter, Ace made more money because he was a bigger draw! If the situation was reversed, I have no doubt that Peter would have taken more money than Ace and slept well at night doing it. This guy never got over his delusions of grandeur regarding his importance as a musician and his contribution to rock and roll. I can't wait to see KISS in concert, and I won't feel ripped off for having Eric Singer on the drum stand.
0439023513|4.0|I have to admit I was disappointed, but I guess I appreciate the final book for the same reasons it annoyed me.
B000FC12L4|5.0|This book is amazing. It adds to the world of Sabriel and keeps you wanting more. I wish this were a longer series because I love the world that Nix has created.

B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|This woman has the voice of an angel. I think her voice just keeps getting better as she ages. I thoroughly enjoyed this cd.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|This movie never gets old. It shows you that if you want something real bad, just go for it. If you don't you  may just fail at everything, if you never try.. What's the worst thing that could happen?  You could be disappointed? So what! Life is full of disappointments.Get over it! Pick yourself up and get on with your dream.  I recommend this book to everyone. Young and Old alike.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|enjoying the book, dont want to put it down once i start reading.  daughter suggested it to me. glad i got it
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is a great solitary game. A brain teaser ( good exercise for the old noodle ) beautiful music, fun surprises, puzzle s within puzzles, gorgeous lights and graphics, a good mix of challenges and easy.<br />  If you've never played Quell before I suggest you get the older version. This is the Dream version all US Quell addicts were waiting for.  Some downward now: The hints get more expensive as you progress and and you only earn one coin per perfect score. The jewel hint is a dating green box, almost impossible to see, and there are no clues for finding clocks or how to retrieve those elusive jewels!  But it's still the best game ever,
B00594XOZU|5.0|grand daughter sends me a text daily to updat me on what she is up too,  works great, enjoying it
B000W44IZW|3.0|I actually fell asleep three times before watching the entire movie. Partly because of the soundtrack I suppose.  Just 3 stars because I was expecting a little more action and reality.

B004UJTG6Q|4.0|A timeless classic to read over and over.  Great to pass on to the kids when they need something to read.
0375714839|5.0|\\"Persepolis\\" is the autobiography of Marjane Satrapi, a young Iranian girl living in Tehran. She was a middle-class only child and had your typical childhood dramas. But she also had to deal with the oppressive Iranian Revolution and Islamic Regime. Eventually her parents sent her away to Europe - and then she had to figure out who she was, a foreigner in a foreign land.<br /><br />Way back when I lost my job, I found myself going to my library (it was within walking distance) and checking out a lot of movies. A trailer for \\"Persepolis\\" made me interested, and I watched it - and REALLY liked it. That was when \\"Persepolis\\" first came on my radar.<br /><br />More recently, a good Goodreads friend of mine read this book and wrote a wonderful review. After years of hemming and hawing to buy this book and read it, I IMMEDIATELY broke down, bought the graphic novel and read it. And enjoyed the hell out of it.<br /><br />I can't really go far into discussing this amazing book without talking about another book about the Iranian turmoil, the recently released memoirs written by actress Shohreh Aghdashloo, [[ASIN:006200980X The Alley of Love and Yellow Jasmines]]. My complaints about that book were many, but what it ultimately boiled down to was I felt the story was skimmed over and diluted, that I never felt the terror of the age and the drive to leave.<br /><br />Everything that Ms. Aghdashloo's book wasn't, Ms. Satrapi's book IS. \\"Persepolis\\" is the most heartfelt, gut-wrenching, REAL book. Maybe this is going too far, but I liken it to this generation's \\"Diary of Anne Frank\\".<br /><br />Marjane is a REAL character. She is a jerk, she is rude, she is broken apart, she loves her family and friends, and she is smart. Sometimes she is so mean and rude, you want to slap her silly; other times, you can feel her problems so well, you just ache for her and want to hug her to death. It's obvious why she had to leave Iran - and it's obvious why she had so much trouble in Europe AND when she returns. There is none of the guessing I had with \\"Yellow Jasmines\\". There is none of the longing to SEE the things the author is talking about (and I'm not talking about the image aspect of \\"Persepolis\\" over \\"Yellow Jasmines\\").<br /><br />Each character in \\"Persepolis\\" is vibrant and unique, from her parents to her grandmother, to her uncles, to the prisoners her parents know, to her own friends, to her husband. There is no confusion about who is who. There is no wondering what this name is and what character belongs to it. The people are REAL.<br /><br />As for the visual aspect of the medium, I think it's genius. It has a light-hearted appearance, but don't confuse this for a \\"kiddie\\" comic! It's got serious issues - oppression, torture, drugs, sex, alcohol (no graphic nudity or anything so no worries!).<br /><br />I think most importantly, it was this book that made me realize how much of a stupid American I am. Maybe this is my shoddy world history coming out, but I naively thought that Iran was ALWAYS Muslim, that the women ALWAYS wore headscarves. This book finally whacked me in the face and made me realize that this is definitely NOT the case - that I was, yet again, being self-centered and uneducated. And made me realize that I need to do some serious brushing up on my world history (and to get a NON-American point of view!)<br /><br />This book made me laugh, made me cry (or come as close as I get to crying!). Marjane Satrapi deserves every ounce of accolades and kudos for this graphic novel AND the movie. It was everything I was aching for from Ashdaghloo's memoirs and didn't get - and a bit more. I give this the highest recommendation I can.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*D when she returns. There is none of the guessing I had with \\"Yellow Jasmines\\".

B007MG360G|4.0|I love all three of these games; doodle god, devil and farm. My only complaint is that the games end too quickly
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|Love Dori!  She is the hit of the show!  The turtles are way cool, especially the babies when they talk!
B00797MB0O|3.0|Kind of slow at times but overall it was okay. Charlize Theron did a good job but her supporting actors were lagging.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Pretty cool game so far. I haven't finished it yet but for a free game it's pretty interesting. And somewhat difficult at times.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Love all the Batman movies! It's nice to have this trilogy all in one set so you can store them all together.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|I should have known I was being stupid: I was told the originals were released untouched on Blu-Ray for cheap, so I finally jumped at the chance to get it.<br /><br />BEWARE:  Blue tinted Darth Vader helmet cover Blu-Ray boxset ARE SPECIAL EDITION B.S. copies.  And NO WHERE on the box does it say this.  I read every area on Amazon over and over and over, never seeing anything about a special edition or updates or anything.  They just kept saying original trilogy blah blah.<br /><br />When I got the box, I read every word on the box three times before opening the plastic to make sure.  Still nothing about special editions.  Open it, and ah, you motherfu...<br /><br />They're special editions.  They're slightly better (Han and Gredo shoot at the same time.  Still stupid, but better than it was I guess. And I think they took out the stupidly added Luke scream when he purposefully jumps off to be caught by the Falcon.)  I would have held out longer if the package had said ANYTHING about this.<br /><br />So the movies look good and stuff, but my low score is because it was impossible to find out how much these were altered. I should've known the internet would have shat itself the moment untouched versions were released on Blu-Ray, so I guess it's partially my fault.<br /><br />I'm just going to stick to watching my old DVD box set that came with untouched originals. If I feel like watching the trilogy and not know what they were able to pull off in the 70's versus in the 2000's, I'll pop this in. But probably not much.
B004WJREMW|5.0|Let me first start off by saying that I love this album and hate this album for a couple of reasons. I can understand why many fans hate it and I also understand why people love it so much too.<br /><br />One of the reasons I hate \\"Mccartney II\\" it is because there is no way that the same man who wrote the gorgeous ballad \\"Yesterday\\" could have gone on to record this weird synth music.<br /><br />One of the reasons I love \\"Mccartney II\\" is because it is \\"pure Mccartney\\" playing all the instruments again like he did on his first album \\"Mccartney\\" after the Beatles split nearly ten years prior.<br /><br />Wings just split and Mccartney was back to the basics again. He had spent time recording at home taking a break and wasn't even focusing on releasing an album until one of his friends told him that these demos were his new album and that Paul should release it. And that he did to such mixed critical and fan reviews.<br /><br />This is the same same man who had a career filled with surprising hits and songs that surpassed his work with the Beatles and with heavy experimentation, creative use of line-up changes in his band Wings always challenged his listeners with artsy pop/rock that was accessible. Music that made you scratch your head and think \\"What is Paul Mccartney doing?\\"<br /><br />Now looking back on the music of his long career that shaped my life, I see a rich tapestry of work full of ups and downs, frog choruses, nursery rhyme pop hits, rockers, ballads, classical pieces, jazz standards, electronic music, etc. I will note that Mccartney's solo career is longer than his time in the Beatles, yet the Beatles established the blueprints for the proto-type music of his solo career. Who is to say that his best work was with the Beatles? Mccartney without the Beatles is still Mccartney...the guy capable of writing great songs without John Lennon. The same Mccartney who gave us \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" was still experimenting with new tones and sounds this far along in his career. He is a mystery, despite being able to write the catchiest and simpliest pop and rick tunes on the planet. His melodies and knack for writing a memorable tune is unmistakable to this day. Mccartney can write any kind of tune and make a hit, even his turds are damn good. Which is why he is one of the most important musicians of all time.<br /><br />Is \\"Mccartney II\\" one of his turds? Well in 1980 it may have seemed that way to many of his critics, following the commercial failure of Wings' final album \\"Back to The Egg\\" in 1979 when he signed to Columbia Records. Mccartney's sales were down and the success of three hit singles \\"Goodnight Tonight\\", \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\", \\"Coming Up (live at Glasgow\\") were the only good thing he had going for him as the 70's drew to a close.<br /><br />Sure he looks confused on the cover...just as confused as us after we listen to it. \\"Mccartney II\\" is robotic synth pop/rock that is both cold and bizarre to say the least. One would approach this music for the first time as one of Mccartney's worse achievements, but upon repeat listens you will find that it really delivers as one of his best, even if it is the strangest batch of songs he's ever done. But the music he made on this record really fit in with the new wave/post punk/pop that was present on the radio a the time. Just listen to \\"Electric Avenue\\" by Eddie Grant and some of Talking Heads and David Byrne to check that fact. The fact that it is all Mccartney on all the instruments make this album so much more fun than what it is, and he really pulls off a down home kind of record.<br /><br />When was the last time Mccartney experimented this much with sounds on an album...maybe not since \\"Sgt. Pepper\\". Maybe here more with synths than an orchestra, but these songs still retain their simplicity even though at times they get a bit complex. This is Mccartney having fun again, and it shows. That is another reason I love this album so much. He didn't seem concerned about makinga good record, yet it is. He may have alienated many of his fans and casual buyers of his albums when this was released, but we may never hear such a quirky and fun side of Mccartney like this again. This is the album where \\"Famous Groupies\\" from the \\"London Town\\" album would not have been out of place on.<br /><br />Mccartney seems to have transformed into more of a cartoon character here than he did during his \\"Yellow Submarine\\" days. And I think that it is good to see the mega-star rock icon in such an interesting DIY sort of environment.<br /><br />The album kicks off with a sped-up version of the funky Wings live hit \\"Coming Up\\", which was released as a bonus single with this record. John Lennon claimed it was one of his favorite Paul songs. It is an optimistic piece of funk/pop that just makes you happy and want to dance. Mccartney sounds like a chipmunk on acid on this, but it's a fantastic tune nevertheless. A wonderful (at the time ground-breaking) pre-MTV music video was done for this song that is so much fun you have to see it to believe it.<br /><br />\\"Temporary Secretary\\" is mind-melting synth pop that sounds like DEVO on acid, a bit annoying at times, but the lyrics are so chauvinistic and suggestive it makes it enjoyable.<br /><br />\\"Nobody Knows\\" and \\"On the Way\\" are great bluesy little numbers that stand out, and help shape the record nicely. \\"On the Way\\" has some fine Mccartney bass playing and guitar chops. \\"Dark Room\\" is a return to the weird funkiness of the album that we experience and sets a great dark tone. For Mccartney he really seems creepy on this track. The same creepy guy on \\"Temporary Secretary\\" but out of the office in his spare time!<br /><br />\\"Frozen Jap\\" and \\"Front Parlour\\" are stomping great instrumentals that show off further experimentation with the synths with an orchestral approach. He's noodling here but it's fun noodling.<br /><br />\\"Bogey Music\\" sounds like old timey rockabilly rock music from the 1950's with a  twisted band playing it.<br /><br />\\"One of These Days\\", \\"Summer's Day Song\\" and \\"Waterfalls\\" are some of the most hauntingly beautiful songs of Mccartney's back catalog and they blend in well here against all the synth layered pop songs. The bonus tracks \\"Check My Machine\\" and \\"Secret Friend\\" are also great.<br /><br />Not exactly the Mccartney record you put on when you you think of his biggest hits, but a great album to get lost in with recreational drugs or when you want a totally refreshing perspective of Mccartney. He got weird again for a bit on 1986's \\"Press To Play\\" but this is about as weird as he gets and he released \\"Mccartney II\\" at a good stage in his career. He may not have sold a lot of records for Columbia/CBS when he was with them, but the 1980's sure proved to be an interesting time for his music.<br /><br />You may want to hate this album because it can be cold at times with all of the synths. You may also want to hate it because it is a side of Mccartney you may not enjoy. The music here is not as overblown and pompous as some of his bigger hit records and singles. It brings Mccartney down to earth, whereas albums like \\"Venus and Mars\\" and \\"Back to the Egg\\" were much spacier, and fed his ego more. Mccartney recreated his sound here and put his ego aside. This is not one of his \\"vanity\\" albums, this is Mccartney being ugly and rude...perhaps the album he should have released in 1978 instead of \\"Londown Town\\" at the height of punk rock. This album would have been far more appropriate if he recorded this then.<br /><br />Some of the songs may sound a bit pretentious, but that is only because the nature in which he experimented with the synths, but what we really have here is a bunch of fun, catchy simple Mccartney tunes that you will want to sing along with over and over again. He has so much fun here you want to join along with him. He doesn't seem bored like he did on 1983's \\"Pipes Of Peace\\", on \\"Mccartney II\\" you can hear in the songs he's making an effort to make some interesting music.<br /><br />\\"Mccartney II\\" is Mccartney's hit album in disguise--when some of his albums were turds in disguise. An interesting way to look at his career, but albums like this and \\"Ram\\" definitely stand out as some of his better recorded moments. There is so much to love on \\"Mccartney II\\".
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is by far the most intriguing and suspenseful mystery game I have indulged in. If mystery and a sort of I spy is an interest of yours, this will be your game. I can't wait to play the second one.
B002ASVYPU|4.0|Great DVD!  Love the music, the line up of the music and the artists.  I will buy more of there music!
B000002I97|5.0|John just has a way of his own. With the flavor of America that no one else has he is a genre to himself. If you only have one Prine consider this one first.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Great movie if you are in your 40's. good humor and decently written. Acting is great and kept us laughing through the entire movie.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Awesome book. Breathtaking from beginning to end. Definitely recommended. Can't wait for more. I hope it never ends. Good job Sylvia Day.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|THIS app is amazing!  Its THE best drawing  app i have gotten so far. I love the way it runs, and that you can make your own colors but also choose from customized ones. Its very fun if you just like to draw, or sketch. So far, i have not experienced any glitches. It runs very well and is easy to use.
B00006690G|2.0|This is without a doubt the poorest quality CD I've ever purchased! Half the time my CD player, in any vehicle that I own, will not even pay it. I'll never buy from this seller again!
0765348276|5.0|Some books you read really stick with you.  They become a standard that pops up in your mind as a sort of side note to the action in your life.  A phrase or an idea that applies to the situation or just a moment of musing.  I have a few of those stuck in my mind and Old Man's War sort of crept into that line up.  I didn't expect to like this book quite so much when I read it, I admit.  I didn't even realize that it was that great after I read it: I just liked it.  However, as I hit my 40's and aging and children and the future I can affect but not inhabit start to matter more to me, this book is starting to speak up in my mind.<br /><br />I know there's people out there mocking me right now.  Sure, there's a lot more meaningful, better written or more worthy books that would make a better mental guide (haha).  But when I read this I wasn't looking for something like that.  I wanted some entertainment and it delivered.  The main character acts with grace and aplomb and offers a soothingly likable narrator. The science fiction view of the future is engaging and the action/violence is offered both with (dark)humor and empathy.  Am I making the book sound boring?  I guess it could be, for those looking for fast action or, inversely, great literature.  If you're looking for entertainment, this is sort of like a book with a hidden bonus.  Some of you will not find the bonus; some of you will say it's lame; and others will enjoy the little extra ideas it had and value it a bit more.<br /><br />Anyway, I really liked it. My father, who is in his 60's, also liked it.  And that's saying a lot.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|great game keeps my mind active<br /><br />.It's fast paced. Fun fun fun!<br />I also loved that such a fun game was free!
0143120530|3.0|A somewhat feel-good high-level journalistic look at memory competitions that scratches at the questions of if memory can be improved. Spoiler alert: not entirely. Most of the people memorizing decks of cards and digits of pi are using a mnemonic trick to visualize the symbols pictorially, which works but unfortunately isn't much more than a parlor trick, and not a mind-blowing way to harness some kind of photographic memory.<br /><br />The book is an interesting read, following the author as he tries to break into the world of memory athletics, training with European masters for the big competition. But the looks at the science and questioning behind how memory works are somewhat glossed over. At first, the book had me interested in digging deeper into the works of other memory guru types, but the more I read, the more I saw these as Ponzi scheme artists all writing the same book on the same parlor tricks. This was a good human interest read, but not as earth-shattering as hyped.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The reason why I like this game is because I love it in it IS NOT a hard game after all BUT some people get help LIKE i looked the answer off of YouTube.com though
193700788X|4.0|Haven't read any of the other reviews yet, but I'm surprised to see an average rating of 3 stars.  I thought Dead Ever After was a pretty good book, and definitely better than some of the others in the series.  I have been reading Charlaine Harris since her Aurora Teagarden and Shakespeare books, and her stories are always engaging and hard to put down.  This was no exception.<br /><br />Sorry to see this series end, but I'm glad she finally received recognition (thanks, Alan Ball!) for her writing.
B0086700CM|3.0|i like this but the only bad thing is the graphics they are good but they could be better and i think that the camera when the monkeys are behiind you should spin around you so you can see the monkeys face
0847835073|5.0|This is a big, heavy book of photographs of a woman so beautiful that the word \\"beautiful\\" is too mild.  It seems almost impossible that any person could look so good from every angle and every distance and every pose.  Monica B is one in a billion.  And before you balk at the price, know that proceeds from this book support two of Monica's favorite charities, both worthwhile causes.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This game Ie good nice levels it gets harder it has a good story and good geographical and motherboard and stuff
B004HW7JHE|5.0|I don't know how this show can get so many awards and yet people still aren't watching it with the cult following Walking Dead has.  It's a real shame because it's fantastic and so well written.  I love having the blu-rays or dvds because each season my husband and I have a marathon before the new episodes begin.  Better price for these on Amazon than anywhere else!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I would recommend. Can't wait for more to come. Had me and my kids on edge. Hurry up with more levels please!!
193700788X|5.0|As I was reading the book, I thought well, it's nice to back in Sookie's kitchen and such, and the book is sort of tying up loose ends. Then I find out yet another book is coming out promising to tie up the loose ends. A little disappointed about that. I would have liked to see a  more respect to her loyal readers and a little less thought towards marketing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|However. I've only had this game for a couple of days and I already love it...a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so realistic
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Animation isn't what it used to be, and that's a good thing. I loved everything about this movie. Not usually a collector of DVDs<br />After you see it, you'll find yourself saying &#34;Squirrel&#34; to your friends and sharing a good laugh.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm so excited for the next book to come. This is a great love story I don't want to see end=)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but it needs an update.First of all you don't get redsone for mining redstone ore.Second of all the nether reactors core isn't that exciting,but an entire realm of netherrack and nether fortresses and lava now thats worth seven dollars!Third of all the should be cave systems.How cool would it be to mine into a cave people! FORTH of all villages emeralds leveling up more mobs in other words make it more like the Pc version!!!!If anyone agrees with me post a coment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ;)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The story line was a little disconnected, but it was an excellent read!  Very well written and teh characters had real personalities.
B00C5GZKVQ|1.0|It's hard to navigate and shoot your enemies. Not well made defiantly not worth any money. It does have tutorial but it really doesn't help with shooting or locking onto your targets.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible is easy to read but also I love the option of having it read to me and is quite comforting at the end of the day.

B00A81MV3U|4.0|This is a sweetly moving film about a man trying to put his life back together as he adjusts to his diagnosis with Bipolar Disorder.  That would be hard enough, but it is complicated by the consequences of a crime of passion he committed . . . before he was appropriately treated.  Helping Pat's recovery is Tiffany . . . a woman he meets who is battling demons of her own.<br /><br />I'm a psychologist so I really appreciated the realistic portrayal of mental illness in this film.  It does a great job of humanizing those with mental health issues and depicting the obstacles they encounter as they struggle to get better.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a fantastic read. Yet, the sex is a big part of who Christian is and the book as a whole, the relationship between Ana and Christian is so intriguing it's hard to stop reading one you have started.<br /><br />If you need something funny, sexy, emotional & shocking this is your read! ;)
B008JFUMDS|4.0|Four up-and-coming magicians from different walks of life are recruited by a mysterious benefactor to co-headline an outrageously successful Las Vegas show.<br /><br />But the benefactor is also utilizing these four magicians to do his bidding, which involves some magic tricks that are not so legal, such as robbing a bank.  So a Las Vegas cop must track these four across the country to try to determine how the magic tricks are accomplished, who is guilty of what, and who is behind it all.  The movie does an excellent job of establishing several credible suspects.  My favorite part is when the former magician turned debunker reveals the secrets behind the magic tricks.<br /><br />This was an intriguing movie with compelling magic tricks and interesting characters.  Unfortunately, I found the plot fairly incredible . . . and by that I mean, not credible.<br /><br />This was a fun little ride, but shortly after the movie ended . . . poof . . . the magic was gone!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is sweet. I've seen the movie before.I didn't think that they would come out with the game for it. The only bad ting is that it takes forever to load.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Incredible story. My wife and I absolutely loved it. I would recommend to anyone. Funny, touching, moving... greatness. Must watch!
B004JHYRP4|5.0|Thought I'd read them all, but missed this one.  It's been years since last one read. As usual loved every page!  Loved the different view points in the book. At first it caught me off guard, but really enjoyed it
B00DBSZEH2|2.0|This movie was a waste of my time!!!! The special effects suck the plot sucked...everything sucked!!!! Don't waste your time!!!
B000QUT9RY|5.0|I purchase this around 3 years ago bcuz I was on a budget now I have KRK's but these little mother f***ers surprise the hell out of me. tthere loud and very crisp
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this app it was so cool I could not put it down until I finished the game. I love it so much I finished it in 17 days twice.
B00BI745AA|4.0|I saw the Broadway version and the singing is such a big part of the story.  Jackman, Crowe and Hathaway are great actors but mediocre singers.  I gave the 4 stars for their efforts.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I loved it it was so cool that I walked to bed and never went to bed. because of this awesome. intelligent and unicque access to me and my bed
B006INDMEE|4.0|I was disturbed by this movie because it was horrible to think of all to the evil at the hand of one man. I was not clear to me who survived at the end of the movie. I would not recommend this to children or teenagers only adults.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I down loaded this game to my Kindle Fire.  It works perfectly and my grandchildren are hooked on the game.
B004L86718|5.0|I watched this again, this time with my adult kids.  As always, classic lines about show me the money, kuan, and had me at hello.  Cuba Gooding at his best.  They loved it as well!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is very very awesome like totally epic. I was going to get a different game but this was cooler.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book I've ever read. It was great and exciting to read!!! I love this book. It's greater than ever.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Now my husband and I can watch the mentalist any time we want, and don't have to wait for it to come on t.v., we just pop in a dvd.

1616550414|5.0|Perfect for the zelda enthusiast, this book is a  great quality collectable. If you love Zelda you will love this book, great price too!
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Interesting read with lots of ideas, good stories and facts that I didn't know.  It caused me to go try on some 5 finger shoes and it took to long to align my toes to get them on, so I opted for other shoes that fit more like a mitten that encourages a mid-foot strike.  They make me feel like I can run like the wind and I'm 66 years old.  We will see how it goes.
014242613X|4.0|I bought these books as a gift for my sister who is a Jehovah's Witness.  She enjoys reading novels, but skips over any violence or sex paragraphs.  I thought these stories, written for younger readers, would be ideal for her.  I was right!  (She is 80 years old.)
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is written from a dogs perspective and I loved it even though parts of it were very sad.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Cool game.  Not too easy but not real difficult either.  Level solutions can be solved with just a little brain power and a bunch of logic and common sense.  Fun to play.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a quick way to view my emails and answer some quickly.  I like that it's on my Kindle Fire and can go with me easily.
1451695195|5.0|A really good read. NDE are something that I find really interesting and this book tells it best. If you have an interest in this subject then this book is for you.
B00514HDNW|4.0|As we all know...never judge a book by its movie. Though the movie did make me pick up the book. Great twist at the end.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I love love love 2 Broke Girls!  I watch it religiously on TV and can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD. The humor is so dirty and funny that I am sometimes shocked that it is aired on television. Kat Dennings character, Max, steals the show.  Sophie and Oleg are hilarious, too.  This is my fave show hands down.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed this game.  Love this genre.  Can't wait for More levels. Fun.  Going to let me 12 year old try. Know she'll love it too.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I am a New Kids fan from 25 years ago and I think this is the best CD they have ever done. Very grown up. A must if you are a fan!
B002M5E2DW|4.0|This book has a great purpose but there's nothing in it that you haven't read in other &#34;Create your own world&#34; kind of books.
067144901X|5.0|My 15 month old son loves this book. He has several books by Sandra Boynton and he loves them all, but this one is his favorite because of all the animals and the sounds they make.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Good game it was free gives options go get upgrades<br /> and models the graphics are great however not the easiest to money v er
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wonderful...can't wait for the next. Hope it won't be too long. Kept me on the edge of my seat and bed.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Seriously - no description needed.  Just wonderful.  Standard Julie Andrews.  lots of singing and great story line.  classic that can be seen over and over
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Sabbath have created an album both true to their heritage and that pushes the ball forward in the realm of metal.  And that is not easy.  There are lots of ways to manipulate voices through recording technologies, so part of this might be artificial, but Ozzie's voice sounds like he did in the early days.  Sharp and piercing and durable.  The songs are deep with layers of sound like early Sabbath. But this is more than a tribute to days gone by.  Songs like \\"Beginning of the End\\" and \\"Damaged Soul\\" venture into adjacent space.  Get the album and crank it up.
B000QCQ970|5.0|An exceptionally lucid and intelligent insight into learning, and controlling it.<br />Plus great accounts of the worlds of chess and martial arts.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|Just like the 2000+ reviews, I am disappointed. I was so excited when my pre ordered copy was downloaded. It took me over a week to read it. Was expecting an ending. Hmmmmmmm. Will I buy the next book? Really not sure......... $$$$$$$$$$
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I couldn't put the book down as I traveled through generations. Definitely a must read as are his first two books. I'm already looking forward to the next one!
0307744434|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I know some people didn't like the ending but I thought it ended great. The story flowed really well and it was really hard for me to put down. Great job Erin! Thanks for such a different and amazing story.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I enjoyed it, but the story line didn't meet or compare with the 1939 movie. However it was a fun film.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am hooked on Downton Abbey. Love it, watch it over and over, cannot wait till the next season to begin.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|Was kinda hard to play on my phone but the kindle is amazing decent camera angle nice to be able to switch the interface around
0399243860|4.0|Great book, but pages are confusing, throws my little guy for a loop. Other than that its a great kids book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can not believe she just left us hanging. Definitely a great read the whole trilogy..  ....to be continued can't wait
B00A8ECU24|5.0|So what do I have to say about this app? Well, it definitely delivers what's promised and much more. It's a nice game made by nice people. It is what it is. A<br />my little . Pony game.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I heard about this book from friends and I thought I would hate it but now I see what all the fuss was about!
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|A film that I recommend you see. Films you'll also like Paranormal Activity 3, Sinister, Insidious, Polterguist, The Woman In Black, The Tall Man, Offspring. Excellent acting from all the cast, young Lilly and Victoria in the opening scene were so cute. Superb special effects. Lots of scares and suprises. Available to rent or buy now.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I happened upon this band when I watched The Host and later on the radio. I loved radioactive and their other songs seemed interesting. Well when I got the cd and began listening to it, I found that I pretty much love every track (which is pretty unheard of for me). What a fantastic cd and amazing band!
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|I prefer this film to the previous one. Lots of action and comedy. Nice seeing father and son taking out the bad guys. Good scenery. Nice taste of Russia. I recommend you check this out.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This is one of the greatest productions. I have the VHS version of the Lion King and Lion King 1 1/2 that I purchased yrs ago for my now 17 yr old grand.  I purchased the DVD so that the younger grands could also enjoy it. We love it and enjoy watching it over and over.They know all the scenes and songs, but will watch it anyway.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I loved &#34;Wicked&#34; ( book and play), and the second book &#34;Son of a Witch&#34;.<br />Now here is the the story of the Wizard's entrance to OZ!!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I LOVE it you do lots of cool hair styles because i heard about it and i got it so now a play it all the time
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Intense and addictive everyone griped about Travis but Abby is just as frustrating and irritating there meant for each other but there addictive and I'm starting the next book lol
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever!!! Beats temple run by a mile. Temple run isn't even fun anymore but this! I love subway surfers.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Okay, there are better games. Hidden object hunts too easy, not that scary or mysterious. Not bad for a boring night.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book because there was a lot of drama.  The relationships of the characters were deeply intertwined and complex.  I wish the author had created a deeper character profile of the main characters to better understand their personalities and rationale behind their decisions.  The setting was typical for that Southern era.  The ending fell flat for me.
B001XVP9CY|3.0|Very dated for what we have today. It said 2007 but this comes from a much earlier date. With all the other films Ford has stared in this one would have to be what they call a B movie. Maybe in the day it was good but it was a waste of a Saturday night with the quality of films today!
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I expected a &#34;B&#34; movie quality level. This was fairly entertaining movie. Some good action scenes and some descent acting.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This movie could have been better with some minor tweaks. The story had a good premise, but left a lot on the table. What about some flashbacks to fill in story a bit? The climax was decent. Special effects where actaully pretty good too.
B005LJITS0|3.0|not a big Green Lantern fan but it was entertaining. kids loved it so for that it gets 3 stars.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Cool game my son love it he plays it all the time..Now you add the price and this  has now turned into an awesome game.
B00AKKGX4W|2.0|I've tried, this is the second book I have read by this author. She starts out with good characters, but has problems with execution. The story is not edited to flow smoothly, it jumps from scene to scene, and some end abruptly and an entire new day starts the next paragraph. Crucial details are missing throughout the story, as if she is trying to write a mystery, but it just muddles the story.  Plot points are either dropped, not explained, or miraculously solved, or turn out to be unimportant. The author also struggles to write a clear and good sex scene. It isnt the quality of the sex, but the writer's failure to clearly describe them. Even the villain is weakly written and easily handled.<br /><br />I struggled to finish this book. I almost couldn't do it. I managed, but I don't feel any better for it. Waste of my time. I wont be buying any more by this author.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This movie was so funny at parts, I laughed my head off. There was great sadness and in parts. Fantastic!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you like we'll paced, well written novels, you will love this book. Once you pick it up, you will not want to put it down.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works great on my Kindle Fire HD. The feed that stores previous calculations was very handy for my Accounting class.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|Best book that I had read. Love vampire book's so much, that I read almost every book about vampires. Vampires rule.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the coolest on pe, on Xbox, and on pc it is a game worth five stars any day the only bad thing is the lack of update speed it takes three to four months :( but over all epic game
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this book best book ever. I think the best part is when her dress gets burnt. It was not ever expected. I am sorry. Spoiler alert.<br />  From,<br />  Gillian Ryan
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|You have to see, its soooooooo good. The Eagles are a great band and the DVD shows an tells us so much. I just wish it was longer.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It's boring crying c.f. youtube bushy Munich shui:-) b :-) but Nguyen g d h :(<br />High :(th high bulletin cut aunt shelving
B008Y6TGIY|5.0|OK, so we have this girl in a traditional chinese culture who shirks off the invisible cuffs of  grace, demure and silence expected of her to kick some Hun-ny bun and ultimately save China.  No matter that she then turns down the job offered by the most powerful guy in her world to return to her homely life, just to be wooed by the guy who's job she just did.  (Wouldn't it be fun to see a sequel, with Mulan running matters in the imperial court?)  Regardless of Mulan's denial of her own well-deserved promotion which I'm sure set the country back for 1,000 years more, it is nice to see Eddie Murphy get the promotion that he so desperately seeks from his own hollywood-caste ancestors.
0345529057|5.0|I love the series. I watched the first season and then realized i should be reading the books. NO, i did not skip reading the first book because i watched the first season.. thats dumb. You get a lot of background and detail in the book that the show does not give you. But you know that already..
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Good game with a mix of difficulty. like that you can retry a level of not happy with the score. Worth the 1.99
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much everyone should get it it is so much fun to play and it is a great game:)
B0095GSKDE|5.0|Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell is, hands-down, one of the most fascinating books I've read in quite awhile.<br /><br />I've read all sorts of books about success: what it looks like, how one attains it, and even how the arguments of nature versus nurture bring about success. But Malcolm Gladwell tells stories about successful and unsuccessful people--supported by loads of \\"hard data\\"--that turn all of those fine theories about success on their head.<br /><br />As it turns out, success is not about the right family, or a strong work ethic, or an outstanding education, or a lucky break, or being born in the right culture or in the right decade. It is all of these things. Success people are successful because of innumerable factors, but the stories that Gladwell uncovers that reveal these fact are astounding.<br /><br />I recommend you add Outliers to your reading list as soon as you can.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|The reason why I give this app one star is because when I tried to download a video it costs like $3.00 just to download the video even though the app is free.I hope you find this helpful. P.S-WASTE OF YOUR TIME!!
B001AG52AG|4.0|I read the 3 books about 3 years ago. I was not a kid then. I was 66. I found it exciting, mind-bending, deep. The characters were multi-dimensional. The plot was gut-wrenching. The movie added some solidity to the imaginings of that first read. The characters are of necessity somewhat sketchier, but still believable. The special effects are outstanding. After this movie (and 10 minutes of credits) you will want the sequels. I can hope.
B003UESJJC|5.0|great price great special features great quality what else can be said but glad i purchased it when i did nice addition to my collection
B005IQZB14|2.0|While the book is somewhat interesting, I found her to be whiny, shallow and self-centered.  I'm not anti-abortion, but she mentions hers like an afterthought and didn't even list it as one of her tougher decisions in her life.  Pretty selfish.  I really don't respect this woman very much.
B000B589JI|1.0|leaks like crazy.  fell apart the second day i had it.  contacted zippo and was told they cant do anything
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|I loved this book and I love the whole series. Its interesting and exciting and couldn't wait for the next installment.
B001QITO52|4.0|After a long break from making anything, Pink Floyd came back with this CD. It is a wonderful piece of musical art.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Golf Wang Wolf Gang Flog Gnaw Flow Gnag OFWGKTA....Tyler the Creator is the S***!  He's the next great in the music industry.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|What else can I say, but this CD kicks ass! It is a must to own. A great mixture of songs.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|What a great band and album! I love this album and the sound and quality is excellent too! I'm very happy with this purchase and want to hear more from them!
1623420148|5.0|Its not even the end of 2013 and im officially proclaiming Tangled the best novel in 2013. Trust me girls, it will be the best $4.99 you'll ever spend. Just by reading the sample i couldn't wait to finish it reading...and i did in one day...sleepless but i did. The 5 star review should be enough to convince you ;)
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really like this game is great.wish they had more missions though<br />.Its definitely worth getting if you like these kinds of games almost perfect but still love it
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|The Master is one of those movies that gets high ratings from most of the critics, but is, alas, a flop.  It seems that audiences are almost always absolutely without failure inexplicably over-the-top accurate in their assessment of movies - 101% of the time.  This movie sucked.<br /> Where the critics might accurately assess the actors as very good and describe the photography as stunning or with some other profound set of adjectives; the rest of us actually have an interest in spending our money on something that might be interesting regardless of all the technical stuff.  Artsy-fartsy weird is not really all that entertaining for over two hours.  One critic, Rex Reed, did denounce this thing for what it really was:  lobotomized catatonia from the new hacks.  He went on to call it just another new fad and referred to it as tripe. At least there was one critic who saw the same piece of crap that I saw.<br /> Stories that don't have a plot are not generally all that interesting; what a revelation. This was the story (so to speak) of a character with no endearing qualities who runs into a group of people with no endearing qualities; uh, the end. I think it would have been a much better story if they had put the entire cast of characters back on the yacht, then sailed out to sea where they sink to the bottom - fade to black. At least, with that sort of ending everyone in the audience would have felt the satisfaction of knowing that there is indeed something good that could from all this noise.<br /> So, is there anything good that can be said about this adventure to nowhere?  I suppose that if you are a young man who was born after the infamous 1980's trend toward radical fem landscaping, it could be educational. If you ever wondered from whence and how the term beaver evolved into, hmm, other nomenclature, you might better understand the etymology in one on-ship party scene.  Unfortunately, you will find that this is absolutely the only educationally redeeming valuethroughout the entire hodgepodge of claptrap drivel.<br /> In short, I would recommend to anyone thinking about watching this movie to better spend your money on glazed donuts, or twinkies and spend your time better by watching paint dry. Note to file: The one star rating is because Amazon requires that you select at least one, so add this minus sign to my one-star (-).
B008JJM88Q|4.0|At first when I got this app, I thought this was a joke but I gave it a try. The first time I thought of somebody, the genie got it right! It was amazing, and the genie got most of the people right. Although, I don't like the games that you get bored of after playing for a while. This app does that, and now I don't play with it anymore. So if you want to spend money on a game that you get bored of, I guess you can, but if not, I don't recommend this app.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love the fact I can create my own sounds to help me relax or sleep<br />I recommend to use this app for complete relaxation to everyone
B00CFQMVLS|3.0|Not the usual action pack connection with actors and their situations.  Movie did not flow from one scene to another.  Characters did not seem to have the impact with action scenes and stunts love die hard movies but this movie need a rewrite
B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|Fantastic album from extremely talented Adam Lambert.  Every song is a joy to listen to and I even would say this album kind of addictive, can't stop listening to it.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|This was a nice story but I like the first Theodore Boone book better.  I thought the part where the guys kind of beat up on the kids and the dog was a little unrealistic.
0345529057|5.0|This is my favorite genre for fiction.  The HBO series is so superbly created that I just HAD to read the whole complete series.  Although I was concerned that this mass-produced book-set would be cheaply constructed, I am happy to state that the books hold together very well.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Definitely a great show if you like corporate style shows or law. I will probably watch all of these again.
B00A85EMVK|2.0|very poor transfer to 3D on the film s video quality.. I feel like sending this movie back to get my money back it's that bad...I have never seen this bad of a video transfer, and 15-20 year old poor quality VHS tapes look better than this NEW; 3D transfer of a classic movie..VERY DISSAPOINTED. Who ever released this movie should be shot or fired or both...
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Why did they ever created this game you have to pay to have all the time you want to play the game my parents won't let me pay it so this game is 100th place
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|This movie which I never heard about,  was a pleasant surprise for me,  and I enjoyed watching it very much..
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't have this game on my kindle but I played it on Deb's iphone so I would think that the enderman should be in the game because he disappears right behind you best game ever played !!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love it and would recommend it to every Kindle customer!!!  My Kindle has charge every single time I've used it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book to impress a girl I liked. I did not hook up with her. The sex in the book got old real quick. I would say the plot was terrible but there would have to be plot for me to say that. The writing is incredibly repetitive. Why do I ever even try to impress women, I am bad at women.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's fun but it's hard to urn a lot of coins and no one wants to spend real money on coins
B00991TCOG|5.0|bought this because i want something I can just relax and listen to good clean music and this is great for that.I love the sound of violin and mixed with dub step and other dance music it is great would highly recommend.
B005GRTNXC|5.0|I love leona songs since bleeding love, i still love her, her songs, i recommend this cd, one of best songs in this album. Like collide, un love me..
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|Great album actually good shot for true hip hop. People stop comparing J.Cole to Kanye album two different types of albums and Kanye was where J Cole is now. Logical progression as a artist for Kanye both albums are great in there own right.Born Sinner is a hit.
B004EPZ084|4.0|Great comedy. Good dialogue between the characters. Jennifer Aniston was hot and it's good to see her play a different type of character. Her most famous being Rachel in Friends. You should see The Good Girl. Good acting. It's worth a watch.
6303014100|5.0|I ordered the VHS version of this film which includes two VHS tapes. I love the widescreen edition, it brings all the scenery onto the TV screen. This film used actual civil war reinactors. The film cuts short the battle of Little Round top(the Union soldiers were actually forced from their location 5 times but refought their way back all 5 times) but it gives a good glimpse into the courage of the soldiers who as Lincoln would later say, so nobley gave their lives and also strives to present the Confederate point of view. The book that this movie is based upon inspired the great Ken Burns in his Civil War documentary. Very worth watching for the history buff and for someone who would like a little more knowledge of the battle of Gettysburg(the bloodiest battle on American soil and took 3 days).
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Cole gives u music u can feel. Kanye has 5 or 6 great songs. J. Cole has a complete and well constructed album. Better than I thought it would be. I'm a kanye fan but yeezy is all over the place and seems thrown together. J. Cole relates to everyone on this album.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis received best actor for his role as Lincoln. He truly did a magnificant job portraying our 16th president. The acting alone is worth viewing this movie. Once during this movie the Lord Jesus' Name is used in vain so I gave it to a good friend. Sally Field who plays Mrs Lincoln does an outstanding job as well. While this film primarily focuses on the passage of the 13th amendment abolishing slavery, this movie is very well worth watching and the contributions by the other cast members is worth commenting on such as the role of Thaddeus Stevens!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I just like it.  I enjoy winning the prizes and the simplicity of the game.  I have been playing it longer than I play other games.  It has kept my attention.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw this in the theatre. Now, I have a personal conviction that I will not own any movies that uses Christ's Name in Vain to which a song does twice so I bought this for my sister in law. I have seen the musical of Les Miserables and this film brings that to the big screen. Hugh Jackman does an outstanding job as Jean ValJean and was nominated as best actor. This film got best supporting actress. If you like the musical you will love this movie! Great movie, worth watching.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book fell short in comparison to the other two books in the series. I guess I became used to the page turning thrill of the adventure, and received (instead) a lot of made up unrealistic fantasy. Don't get me wrong. I enjoy fantasy. I just like to think that the fantasy has some realistic quality...like these things could actually happen one day. Other than this small disappointment, I enjoyed the resolution. The characters were well developed so I came to love each and every one of them. Without spoilers, I emotionally connected to each trial and triumph in these books and would recommend this trilogy to every one of my reader friends.
B001F0WXY0|4.0|I've clearly waited too long to read this book.  What an amazing journey.  I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Guitar work is solid and lyrically the songs are decent not great but decent. Kingmaker and Dance in the Rain are my favorites. I really don't understand the bad reviews. This isn't like risk for the ones saying that. I enjoyed risk but I understand why others didn't. Don't listen to all the bad reviews and give it a listen for yourself.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I like this free app of the day because it provides a list of exercises that can be accomplished without expensive gym equipment.  You can target specific body areas, or you can mix it up and have the computer randomly generate an exercise routine for you.  You can also select the length (time) of your workout. The high-quality video clips demonstrate the best way to perform the exercise.  They are very nicely and clearly presented and they help you to maintain a constant pace. Having a crowd cheer for you after being told your workout is completed is a cute morale booster, too.<br /><br />I have a cover for my Kindle that allows me to prop the device up so I can easily view the videos while exercising.  This is an extremely handy feature, and it allows me to constantly monitor my progress and see if I'm performing the exercise correctly. [[ASIN:B005KDYA44 Marware Eco-Vue Genuine Leather Case Cover for Kindle Fire, Black (does not fit Kindle Fire HD)]]<br /><br />What I miss, however, is a real person to tell me if I'm performing the exercise correctly or not, and to tell me what I'm doing wrong if I'm not performing it correctly.  The product description claims that the app takes the place of a personal trainer, but it doesn't really.  The exercises are SHOWN to you, but they are not EXPLAINED to you.  What if I'm not performing the movements correctly?  How would I know, unless I'm familiar with the exercises before I begin the program?  Considering the overall quality of the app, however, this is a minor complaint.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I read the book many years ago and also saw the movie.  I now own the book and the movie so I can enjoy them at any time. This book works hand in hand with Atlas Shrugged.<br /><br />Recommend it for those who want a confirmation of their ideals.  I don't want to get political here so I won't say anything else.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|It's just really really good.<br />perfect for the time.<br /><br />No drums.... just lots of old synths.<br /><br />A damn great listen.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I would like to delete this review but I can't tell how to do it. I will try to remove it.
B00BEXB18M|2.0|My review title being stated, you are reading the ramblings of someone who has bought EVERY album since \\"Peace Sells.\\"  I bought Dave's book (and loved it).  However, this time around I listened to every track in a sample mode and must say that I can't find ONE track that makes me say I want to buy the album and support the artist.  You could give me this  album for free and I would say no thanks other than the fact it would complete my Megadeth collection.<br /><br />I seriously never saw the big deal about the RISK album and how people said how horrible it was.  I actually liked a few songs off that album.  This one?  Not one.  The only reason I will contemplate buying it is that I think Chris Broderick is the best guitar player they have had and that someone has to support their tour and families.  Put another album out like this and I won't be so nice.
B00BF123WG|4.0|I'm sure a lot of liberties were taken with the production of this film, however it did keep you sucked in with the story and the cinematography worked well.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I didn't really like the wizard of oz but I gave oz the great and powerful a chance and it was great. If you're not a fan of oz you still might like it and if you are a fan you should really like it. I loved it and like I said I didn't really like the first one.
0679805273|5.0|Great for grads with a special message or kids to have signed with a note from each teacher as a graduation gift. Awesome book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Want to read more novels written by this author. Very suspenseful --loved the story line and how you were hooked right away. I found that I didn't want to put this book down.
B008CLI4N4|3.0|I tried reading the book first. It was a total mess keeping track of four families and their internal and external problems. I don't have cable TV so I had not seen the show. I guess it appeals to the 18 to 25 age group.
0307743659|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. I wanted to particularly point out this edition by Anchor books. This is a pretty typical size for a mass market paperback but I love the features. The font is just right, not to large or small, with good spacing between both the characters and lines. The font itself is clear and easy on the eyes. I love this edition. I have seen other editions of king books (paperbacks) such as those by Signet which in my opinion are inferior in every way. The font doesn't look as clear to me and the spacing is not good. Sometimes the words go to deep into the book towards the spine and it is hard to read back in there, and the paper quality on other editions don't seem to be this good either. I am very happy with this line of Anchor books as far as a mass market version it is superior. Even the huge uncut version of the Stand is a very enjoyable read in this format.<br />The cover is nice as well, I like the choice of cover art and texture. Some of the lettering is raised.  Thank you Anchor, keep up the good work!!<br />As far as the actual story there are plenty of good reviews out there. As I said this is one of my favorite books of all-time. A great read with great characters, setting, atmosphere, story, etc..<br />If you want this in paperback or any others, I know Anchor also has Carrie, The Stand, and Salem's Lot out in this format, these are excellent as far as mass market paper backs go.<br />Great price here on Amazon as well -plus it is Amazon Prime eligible.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|have always been a fan of Peter Falk, even before Columbo. His performance in It`s A Mad Mad World was priceless.
B00CY1JUW2|3.0|I have to say I was initially in agreement with the one and two star reviews I had read regarding this album on my first listen to it.  I kept waiting for a \\"Little Sister\\" or \\"First It Giveth\\" to hit me in the head (\\"My God is the Sun\\" comes closest).  I made the conscious decision to listen to the record at least ten times before posting my review as the band's previous release; \\"Era Vulgaris\\", took repeated listens for me to really appreciate it.  Now, I really do dig \\"...Like Clockwork\\", but not as much as the bands' master works \\"Rated R\\" and \\"Songs for the Deaf\\".  Because those albums include the bass playing and song writing of Mr. Nick Oliveri and the rest do not, I don't think I will like any other QOTSA records more than those two.  Oliveri and Homme had a special thing going together and I think it's a shame that Oliveri's behavior was such that Homme felt the need to part ways professionally.  I have to say I also miss having all the different lead vocals on a Queens record when it was Homme, Oliveri and Mark Lanegan.<br /><br />That all being said I do think \\"...Like Clockwork\\" is a very good piece of work.  There is not a song on this record that I feel the need to skip when I listen to it, which to me is always proof that something is good.  The fact that most of the songs are slower paced doesn't bother me that much (when I go back to \\"Rated R\\" there aren't that many \\"fast\\" songs on that album either).  I just don't like it as much as the ones  I give five stars (\\"Rated R\\" and \\"SFTD\\") or four stars (\\"Lullabies\\" and \\"QOTSA\\").  \\"...Like Clockwork\\" much like \\"Era\\" are 3.5 star albums for me, which I will take over most of the crap that is played on radio and winning grammys these days!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I thought the music playing in the background would be annoying yet I find it very relaxing. The game itself is<br />very challenging, though when I turned off the music I actually found myself getting stressed at times.  Although<br />this is a very personal opinion, I would definitely suggest trying the game with music.<br /><br />This is one of the best, most challenging yet entertaining games I have tried. It is not a &#34;silly&#34; time waster type of game, but one I find mentally challenging and I go to it when I want some quiet time to challenge my brain rather than falling  asleep.<br /><br />Definitely worth a try!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have to quit, it is not going to get any better. It is not that I am a prude. I usually enjoy a good erotic novel but this sucks. Ana is a ridiculous character only second in stupidity to her lover Christian. She is becoming a battered woman and that is not sexy. Both characters are not believable. It is like a BAD LIFETIME movie, the ones that I have to turn off in thre middle because it is too obviously fake.  I am glad that I got it out of the library using &#34;Override&#34;. At least I did not pay for this, I just wasted my reading time when I could of been reading something else.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Really good little 50 shadesy very well written I would read this again and more from this author :) very good buy.
B000FA5TTW|1.0|Kept waiting for it to take off. It gives it all away in the first few chapters. TERRIBLE. I would never recommend this to anyone.
B002ZG4QB6|5.0|Great film, took me back a long time.  When most musicians/singers reappear after 50 years to perform &#34;once again&#34; tours we realise that they shouldn't.  With Cliff and The Shadows it was as though they hadn't left the stage.  Great performance.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|when i play it relaxes me, it's so addicting and fun, i'm not the best aim. take with me on break
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is better than FLOOR ESCAPE it is very fun I LOVE THIS GAME I WOULD MARRY IT. IN 80 YEAR FROM TODAY AND TOMORROW hay this game is better than you reading this
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Reading this book proved to be a very emotional experience.it dispelled much.  Previous misinformation.good people fought on Both sides in the war.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was way fun! It wasn't to hard but at the same time it wasn't to easy.  I can't wait for the rest of the levels to come out!
B00CWIMY3O|2.0|True, I've watched it to see what Mads does with it, but it is a revolting series, which doesn't even have the ingenuity and the stellar performance of Anthony Hopkins to justify its existence. Hopkins made us despise Hannibal and watch him with the kind of fascination we'd watch a python, mercifully caged. Mads is a European gentleman who is civil and bland. He doesn't make us shudder, and he doesn't make us disgusted, which is the slim moral achievement of Hopkins. He is just there--supposedly horrifying but actually rather boring. This is not at all the powerful and subtle Mads in his Danish movies. Here he is out of his depth.<br /><br />The plot has nothing to recommend it. It is fragmented and melodramatic. So many victims and so many murderers, or potential murderers, are mentioned that it's hard to keep track of their names and their whereabouts. Each episode starts with a new murder, where the victim is usually perched on a deer's horns. This image can be horrifying the first time, but the repetitions make it annoying.  None of the murders are solved, and there is no continuity to the plot line. Will's torments are over-the-top sensational and do not advance the plot. I don't know how much of a plot the book presents before Lecter is imprisoned, but it seems that here the producers are drawing out the story--ad nauseam--for financial profit.<br /><br />What is more depressing is the popularity of the series, which has no human interest or psychological depth. Our culture is shamelessly addicted to stories of bizarre horrors. The fact that Lecter is a psychoanalyst is the ultimate insult to all psychoanalysts who try to help their patients. I get the irony, but it is as thick and sickening as lard.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's cool and hard but it's all in the strategy (I can't believe it cuz it's hard but I can always figure it out!)
B009O5CLZY|4.0|This becomes addictive for all ages. Difficult ranges in various levels.  you will love.  The only drawback is it tends to be repetitive.
B007NRWLZ0|5.0|I don't understand why this movie got such bad reviews when it came out.  I personally liked the movie a lot so the critics are useless as usual.
B002DJSBMA|2.0|This movies is long, slow paced, and only mildly entertaining. I really like Anthony Hopkins but that is about the only redeeming quality of this film.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|I was rooting for Gerard Butler's character through the whole movie so the ending was disappointing.  He followed his conciseness and should have prevailed.  Besides, the DA would have been brought up on murder charges in the real world.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I loved this movie and I generally am pretty critical so that is saying something. It has some awesome action and at the same time it upholds moral and principles.
0525478817|5.0|Why write one more shining (and not very articulate) review of this book?  Because it is now one of my favorite books, ever.  I purchased this for my kids, thinking if they said there was nothing good to read that I'd hand them this, or one of the many books I purchased for their age range. They haven't read it yet, but I just finished this wondrous, beautiful, poetic, unflinching, sad, happy, well-written, hard to read book.  I've read over a thousand novels in my life, and I loved this as one of the best.  I'm amazed I can still be this amazed by a novel.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Really good at it. But the thing I mostly like is that you always have to start on the same thing always. But I really think this is a really good game so  the people that didn't buy this hears your chance today
1594746036|3.0|I was really excited to read this book and had high hopes...maybe that is why I was disappointed.  It started out boring, the middle was REALLY good, and then the end was boring and slightly confusing.  About 3/4 of the way through this whole new plot was introduced and it wasn't explained all that well.  I had a lot of questions that weren't answered.  I guess there is going to be a sequel so hopefully that will tie up a lot of loose ends!  The best part about this book was all the old/interesting photographs!
B000067FP8|5.0|truely,a great movie!! it didnt do that well it came out in 1990,but it stands alone as \\"the greatest sequel,ever \\" buy this movie,you will be glad you did. the two twin scientists are reason alone to buy this film. if i can put in a word...FANTASTIC!!!!
0439813786|5.0|This illustrator of this book is gifted.  The book itself is wonderful with an engrossing story line.  This book is timeless.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|exactly as ordered, not sure how to write a review for a dvd movie either you like the movie or not. worked fine, bought new one in factory condition.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|GREAT! HAS LARGE PRINT AND EASY TO USE. ALSO WHEN ADDING, SUBTRACTING, OR ETC, THE LAST NUMBERS KEYED IN ARE ALWAYS DISPLAYED.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far this game is fun. Me and my son love it. This game has not asked me to buy anything yet so yeah at this point its a real free game not a money scam.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I have liked the daily workouts for each body part and now only having to open one app to get the all around workout I am very excited and happy for.  This does a great job with the workout.  Gives you options and most of all can help sneak in a workout when you can't make it to the gym.  I am fortunate to work by myself and can take advantage of these workouts during my breaks during the day.  Highly recommend this app.  Its the one stop shop of the Daily series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a wonderful book. I was hesitant about the book at the 1\4<br /> Mark I couldn't put it down. Simply addictive!!
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I don't know, man..... I liked it a lot.<br /><br />Highlights: Black Skinhead, New Slaves, Blood on the Leaves, Bound 2
B00003CXWV|5.0|i saw this as a kid and i for got what the movie was about so i had to get it. this was a good movie. shipping was extra fast.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is a great read. Always makes you want to keep reading due to the fact of the possibility of this happening in real life. A great love/friendship story that shows how important it is to have a good support system around you!
B00A32H1B6|5.0|i got the 2013 remaster of this movie. i long awaited to actually own it since i rented it on video in the 80's. i think good things come to those who wait, bcos i read complains about the bad sound quality & i found this one perfect to the ear. edda mosser is no birgit nilsson & kiri te kanawa is no arroyo or shwarzkopf, but they sure make a great performance with amazing voices. i find teresa berganza better here than in her famous 3 rossini or the carmen recordings. tremendous solemn scene of the comendatore, a duel of baritons with some of the most amazing music mozart ever wrote. all the voices are at their best on this recording, i just loved everypiece of it. the scenery at vicenza could not be better; customs & hairdos are 1rst class. i just found the subtitles distractive, & since i speak italian i turned them off & then i was really able to concentrate in the clean image & sound of this masterwork. i recommend you a crash course in italian or learn about the plot & lyrics of the opera, for a better artistic appreciation of this most memorable performance of this masterwork. i still favor the  bohm & the giulini versions, but this is a total feast of the senses. i highly recomend it
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this season. Everyone was talking crap about it and about how dexter is getting out of control. Well FYI people that's how it's supposed to be. He's a serial killer and his character is getting out of control. I can't wait for the next season because this season ended really crazy. I love of a bunch of stuff I didn't expect happened lots of twists and turns!
0345803485|1.0|First off, let's just get this out of the way... yes, it really is that poorly written.<br /><br />Spoilers!<br /><br />I wanted to read this just to see what all the hype was about, even if my girlfriend made fun of me for reading \\"lady porn\\".  This book was just awful, on so many levels.  Most reviewers seem to either dislike or feel indifferent toward Christian, but I found myself really hating Ana.  If the gender roles of this book were switched, the author would be crucified.  Imagine a novel where a woman who has (somewhat) unusual sexual tastes, possibly stemming from childhood trauma,  enters into a romantic relationship with a boring, conventional man, makes compromise after compromise, then finally lets herself be vulnerable one time and he basically tells her she's a freak and leaves. Not really a book I'd want to read.<br /><br />I also take issue with Christian's tastes being characterized as bizarre.  Although not necessarily the norm, there is virtually nothing he likes that is even approaching the pale, let alone beyond it.  The only things he does in this book that I haven't done myself are things I would do if I were a billionaire with a sex room in my mansion.<br /><br />And what could Christian possibly see in Ana?  Her inability to say \\"vagina\\"or even a common word for \\"vagina\\" (down there? Is she referring to a basement?) should be a huge turn-off for an experienced sex machine like him (seriously, what man can have four orgasms in one evening?), but somehow it isn't.<br /><br />While reading this book, I went from amused to bored to furious.  Steer clear.  If you want to read books that are entertaining, well written, aren't shy about the sex, and actually have a plot, check out the Sookie Stackhouse novels.  If you want to see a complicated but more realistic BDSM relationship, watch \\"Secretary\\".  If you want to give away several hours of your life and never get them back read \\"50 Shades of Grey\\".
0470913029|5.0|Very educational and interesting read. It was enough to get me to move my eating habits slowly towards the Paleo diet.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|bought them for my daughter, and her mother and I all watch these together. Brought back memories for us, and the youngster loves Daniel. they don't make them like this anymore. Thanks for being there. Wicked fast ship. Would deal with this seller again.
1451627297|5.0|This book is huge and when it came in the mail I thought I'd never read it or at least never finish it. I read it in a week! Could not put it down. The storytelling is engaging and the characters believable--even though it is a fantasy--based on historical events!! A winner!
0525953728|5.0|There is not enough time to describe this book. Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! I started it and finished it within 2 days.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I like this watch, it is the right size and one can read the dial easily. So far runs nice without big errors but the power doesn't last as much as other automatic watches.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I've listened to this album over and over and still love it! Adele has a great voice and her song selections are fabulous! She also has a terrific band behind her.  I'm hoping it won't be too long before she does some more recording. I would add, however, that as much as I love this album, I don't care for her song selections on her album \\"19\\".
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I purchased this for my mom.  She was unsure about buyng it herself and she is so glad to have it and watches it all the time.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I must say this is a very original show, a bit disgusting for some people. I purchased for my wife, she loves to see zombies eating people.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I miss my old Google Reader, but Feedly is a good replacement.  I use it on my iPhone and Kindle.
1934030597|3.0|Very in depth book on maintenance but sometimes it's not easy to follow the instructions as a beginner.  Overall I'd say it's a very worthwhile book.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I could not put this book down!  It was wonderfully written and allowed the reader to really get into this future world and go on this journey into the Hunger Games. Even though I know this book is aimed at a young adult audience I got it because I heard so many good things about it so even though I am an adult I could really get into it and enjoyed it thoroughly so if you haven't got on the Hunger Games bandwagon yet I recommend that you do!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is a really fun game to play I love playing it all the the time finest game ever invented
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have ever seen. I love it. Don't. think about buying it. Just buy it right away. You will love it too.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I hike a lot and use trail tracking apps.  This sucks a lot of power out of my iphone.  I can plug my phone, or any usb devise, into this pack and it charges it in record time.  I have charged my iphone from 'dead' to fully charged 3 times and still show 3 of the 4 'remaining power available' lights on.  I've recommended this to many friends and family and they too are all pleased.  Think about a power outage and you can't charge your phone... you can now.  I've charged this devise up and can tell you that it will hold its charge for a LONG time on stand by for those urgent situations.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is the 3rd review I have given this book and my mind still hasn't changed.  Although many were not happy with the book compared to the first two, I was not disappointed to say the least.  I got to enjoy another book filled with two characters that I love.  As long as its Gideon and Eva then there can't anything wrong with that.....  Can't wait for books 4 & 5!!
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Excellent, exactly what i need it
B00COHAUD4|1.0|The bent over backward, ratchet-y, creepy crawly wall walking has been done and done.  This is two hours of my life that I will never get back.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I wasn't a huge Daft Punk fan before so I wasn't sitting around waiting for this album but then I started reading some reviews and heard what people were saying.<br /><br />If you like this type of music, this album is great! Every song is fantastic. I don't remember the last time I really wanted to play a full album from any artist.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|In all the years of using search engines for the internet, Google's is by far the best of the best out there!!! I've yet NOT been able to, in seconds, find exactly what I'm looking for. (In some cases,much, much more!)<br />So I will always highly recommend any of Google's service's in any shape or form!
B008QPCCQQ|4.0|I haven't read this collection yet, but was pleased with the idea of having Alcott's collection at my fingertips.  Nice addition to my Kindle library.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This is a mobster classic! Right up there<br />with the Godfather. Liotta, De Niro and Pesci at there best. All the side characters are a whos whos of Mob moives and TV.
0062255657|5.0|Like Lettie's ocean, it takes a very powerful mind to collect such an epic tale into such a small volume...<br /><br />Not many stories, when told, feel like they are told for the first time.<br />This story is one of the \\"not-many\\"s.<br />Some of the scenes in this slim novel will probably stay with me for a long time, what else can anynone ask of a great book?<br />The best thing I can do for you is save you some time, so I will.<br /><br />go read this now.
B002CAWNEM|3.0|I bought this mainly as I'm a fan of Ali Larter (from the TV series Heroes). Why isnt she listed with the other 3 names at the top of the page? She was the co-star! Not overly violent and a nice twist on the classic obsession films. A fun movie.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|The Beach Boys were among my favorites when I was growing up in the 60s and they remain so today. This 2 CD 50th Anniversary Tour package is a great reminder of those days and The Beach Boys are as good as ever.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel...in fact had a difficult time putting it down.  I liked the parallel stories of the two main characters and also learned a lot about the Orphan Trains.  I recommend this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read book because daughter was reading it, and now I am hooked!!  We're enjoying reading the series together.  Very well written.
B001543L92|1.0|I am so sad that this record is very bad. I love metallica and was excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock.<br />However, you can tell that this was a cheaply pressed record. My old records have a very full sound eventhough they are 20yr old, but as soon as you play this one you can notice that the sound does not have any levels... It is like the speaker was blown, very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music.<br /><br />oh well, that's what I get for paying only $10+ for a vinyl
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|Watch it for what it is & don't take it too seriously.  The action sequences are child-like and exaggerated and that is fine.  The thing is...they're lacking creativity.  It also appears sometimes this movie doesn't know what it is.  Sometimes it tries to be goofy while at other times it tries to get serious a bit.  It's a bit confused unlike most Arnolds older stuff.
B000SJ9N1K|5.0|Great album and the vinyl it self was great sound quality. I will be jamming this for a long time
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|This is probably the worst movie I have EVER seen!!!! The acting is REALLY bad. The books are really good. I suggest that you don't waist your time with the movie. I could not get past 15 minutes without wanting to slit my wrist. It is that bad. Refund please. I'm not joking. I REALLY want a refund.
B005VPXR3Q|4.0|It would probably be a crime to say that I don't love this movie. It's not quite as good as I remember, but I still enjoyed seeing it again after all these years
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a great game, the puzzles were interesting and the hints were perfectly done. The graphics were incredibly smooth and realistic. One of the best looking games that I've played on my Kindle Fire 8.9&#34;. The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars is because the game wasn't long enough. It had the length of a free game, even though it was $1.99 when I purchased it, I was suprised that it ended as soon as it did.<br /><br />It does tell you at the end of the game that there is more to come, not sure if that means a free level pack upgrade or if there will be an additional fee for more content. I will be looking out for updates.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Watched this on high recommendations, and was expecting perhaps too much. The movie wasn't particularly beautiful, the acting pretty strained and poor overall. Really, just stupid. It's a lame take on trying to capitalize on the success of other better-done vampire movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|one of the best games I've ever played  never gets old and is really simple  best game ever  also on my kindle I always get the latest update  I'm on Miami
0307719219|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and I couldn't be happier with this recommendation.  This is, perhaps, one of the best books I have read for why so many nations fail to develop stable democratic polities and economies.  The authors of this book write a compelling case for the reason why being that, at \\"critical junctures\\" in a nation's history, people created inclusive or extractive political and/or economic systems that ultimately led to their present prosperity or poverty.  A couple of examples Acemoglu and Robinson cite are: the Black Plague that helped to create inclusive economic institutions in Western Europe and extractive economic institutions in Eastern Europe; the Glorious Revolution in England that created an inclusive political institution controlled by Parliament; and the establishment of encomiendas in South America by the Spanish and Portuguese colonists that built on top of the extractive political and economic institutions that were already present there.  And while they are quick to add the caveat that \\"history is not destiny\\" and write about poverty-stricken nations that have successfully done away with their extractive political and/or economic institutions, they devote several chapters at the end on the virtuous circle created by inclusive political & economic institutions that helps perpetuate those institutions and the vicious circle created by extractive political & economic institutions that keeps them going.  These are great conclusions that are wonderfully backed up, yet I have two problems with this book.  The first is how they totally rule out the geographic theory of national development as put forth by Jared Diamond in [[ASIN:0393061310 Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]].  They make a strong case for why this doesn't work, but I don't totally buy it.  I believe that Prof. Diamond's thesis holds greater sway for the development of pre-colonial civilizations, then Acemoglu & Robinson's theory takes hold once they come into contact with colonial powers in their history (one of the critical junctures that they expound upon early in this book).  The other problem I had was a style problem.  Acemoglu & Robinson write throughout about the incentives leaders have to either create inclusive or extractive institutions making it sound like dictators use words like incentives and inclusive politics in their thinking.  I highly doubt many of the leaders of the past and present think in such terms, rather they think in more naked power terms.  I think their style could've been polished so it didn't always seem so overly-analytical.  Still, this is a fabulous book and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the roots of poverty and authoritarianism in our present world.
B008VI0A2G|4.0|I choose this rating cause I'm not really used to hearing Elvis in his younger years.I liked some of the songs and some of the songs I disliked.I would recommend this cd  to  the ones that likes Elvis's early years.

034580404X|3.0|I got this Trilogy as a gift. As I finished the Fifty Shades Freed, I realized I was so glad I did not buy this book. If you can go to your local city library and borrow it, then do so.I have to give her publishing and marketing team kudos for putting this out as an Erotic look at BDSM.If it wasn't for that this book would not have made a best seller list.<br /><br />As I started with Fifty Shades...I saw a good start build up the characters Ana and Christan,but that was were it stopped. I began to get annoyed that there was no real dialog from Christan's point.Since he is the BDSM Dom in the book, there should have been more. There is also no real interaction with the two main characters. It was like being trapped in her mind with Christan and others sometimes visiting. You can really skip most of each chapter and not miss anything in this story. I do like how it was ended to where you almost have to read the next book just to find out what happens with the interesting characters.<br /><br />Beginning with Fifty Darker....If you made it this far into the books, then good for you. At the end of the first book, I knew that if I wanted to find out more about Taylor,Jose,Kate Elliot or Lilly* (*calling her that so I don't have to really check the book again)The refreshing break from the first person accounting from Ana was \\"inner goddess\\". Her parts in the series made this series bearable to read. Like in the first book, you can still skip most of the chapters and not miss anything. The BDSM parts did not improve, as a matter of fact there was less of it and more \\"vanilla\\". This book seems like space filler. If you can get past the middle of this book your home free to finish the series. Good thing about this book is that you see a plot,but that is it you only see it.<br /><br />If you made it to Fifty Shades Freed...If by the time you get to the end of Darker and you don't realize that this series it twilight mix with Titanic, then you might want to start over. This book is the only one of all three that has a plot to it. Jack Hyde would have been great for a p.o.v. from him. You get a glimpse of it at the end of Darker. That glimpse is why I read this last book. Down side is that there is no real background given about his motive for hatred. That would have been great if it was written in somewhere other than the end of the book. It was disappointing that the last two books did not really live up to the titles. It never got darker and I'm still wondering just what he is free from.ook is the only one of all three that has a plot to it. Jack Hyde would have been great for a p.o.v. from him.

B003TSEEDY|2.0|I really wanted to love this book. After hearing so many people recommend it, I was expecting to be impressed. I have never seen a coming of age be so boring. There is no real story line with a climax, just the neurotic ramblings of depressed Charlie. I had to force myself to finish it. It flows terribly and reads very awkwardly. By the end of the book I had no idea what the characters even looked like. I give it two stars because despite the flaws it was able to produce a great feeling of melancholy for me. Perhaps I missed my time with this book and would have have found it charming when I was also a whiney teenager.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|What do you do when you are old and gray and your art is no longer able to be performed? In this case you retire to a beautiful old English Manor full of classical musicians and singers. All performers, once at the top of their game. Which is best to acquiesce or resist the inevitable?<br /><br />At Beecham House,  the inhabitants are planning a fund-raising gala to commemorate Verdi’s birthday. it is directed by Cedric, played by Michael Gambon, and the usual who is best game is played. The appearance of Jean Horton, played by  Maggie Smith, who is a brilliant British soprano, brings issues. If she joined three old friends for the quartet from “Rigoletto,” it would bring in a lot of mney.<br /><br />Wild, played by Billy Connolly, is the lovable lech; Cissy, played by Pauline Collins , lovable but who is losing her memory. Reggie, played by Tom Courtenay, was married to Jean for nine hours years ago and has never gotten over her. Will the four come together and make music?<br /><br />This is at once a lovable film, but also a look at the lives of those who are growing older. We can see ourselves in this elders. The terrific actors play their roles with grace and wit. Real musicians are interspersed into the film as residents of the Manor. Great music comes from the film, and it is an enjoyable film.

B001EOOQEC|5.0|Of all the Sabbath albums with DIO on them that came before the name change to Heaven n hell, this one is a must have...In my opinion it is even better than Heaven and Hell,and Mob Rules...The sound engineering and the lyrics on this one are nothing short of BRILLIANT!!!!  It could easily be a  DIO album, and not a Sabbath effort..Sort of a continuation of Strange Highways...
B0025UHKNS|1.0|This watch has a fantastic feature set. It has everything I would want. The touch bezel issues when wet are not even a problem, they are a minor inconvenience at most. That said, the is the least reliable watch I have ever owned.<br /><br />I have had the following issues with it:<br />- My first watch would have random locations that I was nowhere near on the maps it generated. The map would look normal except a spike that would just out in one direction for 1/2 mile or so.<br />- My first watch lasted a few months and died completely. Neither the soft or the hard reset recommended by Garmin worked at all. At this point I returned my first watch.<br />- The watch they sent me will occasionally (as in at least 1 in 4 runs) display nonsense on the screen in the middle of a run. It still logs the GPS coordinates so you can get a map download after the run, but you cannot get metrics during the run.<br />- The watch constantly crashes. The most obvious symptom of this is that the clock of the face stops running and displays the time when it crashed. Usually you can reset the watch when this happens, but sometimes it eats the battery and goes dead.<br />- Sometimes when resetting after a crash the watch repeatedly beeps a few times, and then resets itself again. This is incredibly annoying, and if you don't have your charger you can't stop it. It just keeps going until the battery dies.<br /><br />So, in summary, while this watch can still be used for some things it is quite aggravating how poorly it works. I have an issue with it in at least 1 out of 4 runs that I do.<br /><br />I WOULD NOT buy this item again. In fact, I am not sure what replacement to get. This watch is so bad I am not sure I want to risk my money on another Garmin.

159463176X|5.0|This is the third book by this author and he does not disappoint.  Having said that, I think his best book was &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|this is a amazing set for anyone that loves lord of the rings. the figures are really cool. they are well done by lego, really i dont think lego could have done better.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|The Becker is a beast of a blade that will survive an unbelievable amount of (ab)use.  And I can't argue with the visceral satisfaction of chopping through a sapling or batoning firewood with nothing but your knife.  But (and this is a big &#34;but&#34;)I think that there are better cutlery options for the majority of people who venture into the backwoods.<br /><br />If you're a backpacker, think long and hard whether it makes sense to add a pound of steel to your pack weight.  Even if you choose to punish your knees, ankles and hips with the added mass, you're still stuck with a knife that is ill-suited for many camp tasks that require a smaller and thinner blade (not to mention a screwdriver, pliers, or can opener).  You'll get better utility carrying a Swiss army knife (check out the Victorinox Soldier or Pioneer) or a lightweight multitool.<br /><br />If you're a hunter or fisherman, you'll quickly find that a 1/4&#34; thick blade isn't great for gutting or skinning, and it's a disaster for filleting.  A Mora Knife, (1/3 the weight and 1/4 the price of the Becker) will work far better.<br /><br />If weight isn't a factor, carry a small hatchet, which will outperform any survival knife at any price point for procuring firewood.  Toss in one of the knives I mention above, and you have a far more versatile combination that still costs less than the Becker.<br /><br />The Becker is undeniably cool and macho, and Ka Bar will sell a ton of them for that reason.  But if you get past the testosterone rush, you may realize that there are better and more versatile options.niably cool and macho, and I'm sure that Ka Bar will sell a ton of them for that reason.  But if you get past that, I think that there are better options.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman has written a beautiful story. I believe this one is my favorite of his. It will definitely be at the top of my top ten list. To say I loved it is so simple but so true!
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|You have to watch very carefully to make the right cut.  You have to make some interesting moves and then it's<br />fun to watch.  Will keep you wondering how to get out of it.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Didn't like all the nude scenes.  The plot was good, but this movie could have been made just as good without all the nude scenes.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|It was a great movie.  We had seen it already and decided we wanted to own it.  We watched it again and loved it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is just the perfect combination of easy and hard. I can't wait for updates and some more levels.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|At first, I expected this movie to be a laid back documentary about the guys who help out at service stations and with tow truck operators. Sometimes while you're working on your car or changing a tire, you need someone to grab the jack for you. Or if you're lifting a car up, sometimes someone tough and brave needs to be the &#34;jack reacher&#34; and get the jack out from under the car. So I expected that. Then suddenly I'm in some action caper. I mean, I would have even been okay with it being a story about Tom Cruise helping ladies reach things up on high shelves in the supermarket... but it wasn't that, either.<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed it, but I sure was thrown off for a while.
B00992CF6W|5.0|so good love this app is so great but it is kind of like a virus because it won't let me use my touch screen some times. but still GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Avoid at all costs. Story, not much of one. The usual car chase, helicopter battle, unbelievable walking around in a radioactive hazard area and joking about growing extra heads. Makes Steven Segal look like a cinematic genius compared to this crap.
B005K17RU0|4.0|the app has yet to fail unlike some other useless weather apps. Easy to use and understand, love the graphs, I have four cities and they're always available.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love this CD.  Michael Buble does it once again.  His voice is so smooth and I love his interpretations of old songs!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Dungeon hunter 4 looked like a game I never wanted to play. But one day I decided, what harm can I do in downloading it. So . I did, and I am moderately impressed.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Wow, IMO with each release these guys just keep getting better and better. They have been around the block so many times that now they sound effortless in these later day releases.<br /><br />Very nice modern sound, commerical yet still hard and heavy not too many bands can do that. Except for a few tracks toward the end of the disc there isnt a bad one in the whole bunch. Everything sounds very precise, very crisp, very to the point, just the way I like it.<br /><br />This is certainly the kind of disc one can put in their car, crank it up and just drive.
0807014273|5.0|... and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now.\\"<br /><br />A man to have survived the Nazi death camps and mold his experience into something that must have saved so many more lives is so profound.<br /><br />A must read.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|Wow, these guys really out did themselves this time, I am not sure what their last disc was all about but this release blows it away by miles.<br /><br />Classic ac/dc, def leppard sound with a clean modern day production, each track rocks harder then the next, what else would a rocker want, buy it, end of story.
B0090XO57C|5.0|No where else will you find all the ingredients needed for life.  Our planet's place in our galaxy and in our solar system show the handiwork of God.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|I have never been a huge Sabbath fan, of course I enjoyed their 3 or 4 biggest hit songs as much as anyone but other than that they were always a little to downtrodden for me.<br /><br />I have heard this new album all the way through and it certainly sounds like classic sabbath, are they ground breaking anymore at this point of course not but good music is good music.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first half of the disc, most of the tracks were very well done with some nice tempo changes, for me the second half of the disc turns into a big sludgy mess, it sort of sounds like they had about 5 good songs in them and the last 6 or 7 were there to fill out the record.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|A wonderful adaptation of life before, during, and after WW1.  Not for young children, though; as some of the lifestyles shown are would raise questions parents might not want to answer right now.
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|I recently decided to buy the doodle jump app, after debating wether I should stick with the free version or buy the themes. In the end,  I bought this 99&cent; app.<br /><br />Was it worth the money? Yes. Would I buy a new and improved version? Yes, because this app does need some tweaks and improvements. (I'll state my complaints in the following.)<br /><br />Doodle jump is a VERY simple game. Yet, strangley addictive. Basically you play as this partial elephant type creature who jumps on these playforms. This little guy supposedly has the name &quot;Doodle the doorkeeper&quot; or something between those lines.<br /><br />This game appeals to both adults and children; I'll give the creators that much.<br /><br />But I would reccomend getting the free version first, just incase you don't like it.<br /><br />Although this app was fun, I stumbled across a very annoying glitch that has happened several times.<br /><br />You sure you wanna know? Okay.<br />Well, it only happens when I play the SOCCER theme. When I face the different countries (ex. China, Isereal, Nigeria, etc.) the music WILL NOT stop playing, even after my creature falls or hits his head and dies. If I play the soccer theme again the music will keep playing,  but if I play a different theme,  an obnoxious fuzzy noise (like a bad radio reception) starts playing. That drives me crazy. After 20 min. of trying to figure out how to fix this problem I finally (at long last)  figured it out. Turn off your device (ex. kindle fire,  smartphone, etc.) and then turn it back on. That worked for me, but I don't know for how long. That glitch is a major pain in the butt, please fix it.<br /><br />But overall, it's a very fun app and I reccomend it to anyone and everyone.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I would not recommend this series for young children.  It seems to glorify some things that are better left unglorified.  For the discerning adult, this is a great series.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|I am impressed with the air flow rate of this fan and how silent it is. Have been looking for just this kind of unit.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you love 'Pride and Prejudice', you'll love this movie.  The acting is great and the location shots are very well-done.  I bought it after watching the movie with my daughter.
0802136834|5.0|I love books like these. This describes every single wife in full detail. I really loved it . I highly recommend it
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss both inspires me and disheartens me.  I am an aspiring author, and have been working on a book for a very long time.  The name of the wind is a book that took a very long time to come to fruition, and is only the better for the long long birthing process that it underwent.  This inspires me to believe that I can eventually put out a good novel even if it takes me many years.  The disheartening aspect of reading this book is that when compared to this incredible work of literature, I can only imagine my own book will look drab and lackluster next to it.  Luckily my name is not alphabetically next to his so the comparison will be at least a few shelves away(assuming I do eventually finish it).<br /><br />And now to the actual review<br /><br />  Patrick Rothfuss' book is a writing of three qualities.  The first quality is a soft, buttery smoothness without jarring edges of logic flaws and inconsistencies that shake the reader out of the story.  The reader glides effortlessly within, only breaking the surface into reality by force of will.  The second quality is a quality of truthfulness.  Rothfuss doesn't stop the story to explain how magic works, it is cleverly woven into the story with such subtlety that you accept the truth of magic as it is presented (even to the point that it seems like an obvious truth that magic isn't really magic, even if it is). The third quality is a quality of compelling.  This is a dangerous quality.  If you read five pages, you will find yourself helplessly compelled to read on, only to realize with dismay that there are not enough pages, it will eventually end and you will be forced to get the sequel so you can once again enter this wonderful world.
0307594009|5.0|I love this book. I really do. It explains her story after she stops writing in her diary. Very touching
0316174483|5.0|Such a cute book and wonderful ideas to keep my kids busy.  We used these ideas in the classroom for a teacher gift and she loved it!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I love this movie. Always makes me cry. I'm a sucker for musicals, so this really caught my attention. LOVE
0694524441|4.0|A simple story of a simple shepherd's search for 'his treasure'.  As he goes forward, he learns much about life along the way.
B0000AM6IY|4.0|It's a classic. I love it. I always will. My husband is obsessed with musicals, so I'm always watching this stuff
1401229921|4.0|While this was a gift, I had the chance to check it out first hand -- and I have to say that if you are an artist, comic enthusiast or Batman fan in general this is worth picking up. Forget about going back to the drawing board, Batman: Hush Unwrapped Deluxe takes you into it as you turn through the pages and see what the artist was thinking from concept to creation in stark detail from sketches, action and shading techniques and the back and forth on-page discussions/recommendations with the inkers. This edition shows the work behind the art that ultimately becomes that next riveting issue in your hand. Again, worth picking up and adding to your shelf... or leaving out and letting friends turn through.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|It's a great movie for my children. My daughter is pretty young, and she enjoys listening to the music. She gets really into it
B00280LYHS|5.0|I'm only ten yet best book.lots of action fun moments and heroisme.hope you read the second serie just as great.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really loved this book .... Haven't seen the movie yet ........ I got the feeling this was not your typical Nicholas Sparks stories ..... This one had it all ... Love story , suspense , and not soo predictable ,as his books usually are ... Way to go Nicholas ! !  Give us more ! !
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wish there were more levels...it took forever to download and it took me less time to solve.  It was fun while it lasted.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this show and I can't wait for it to come back on ..... I have all 3 Seasons and I will buy Season 4 and all others ! ! !
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|In this outting, Eliane Elias didn't disappoint.  As, she captured the essense of Chet Baker's astounding vision of love, longing, and romance. Which she managed to do on her tribute to Bill Evans cd.  Again, Eliane Elias marvels and delights her legions of fans with her craft.  She's truly and inspiration to the genre of jazz, to which many can enjoy and appreciate a vastly underappreciated body of work. I as a fan,look forward to her many more of her projects. That give me feelings of joy and elation upon listening to her play over and over again. Where I will never grow tired.  Thank you  Eliane Elias, as you will always have my support and admiration.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I particularly loved the book because it's really different from what you normally find in other books, it was really amazing and creative and kept you in suspense (but not so much to get frustrated or at least that's what I want to believe haha). The end was great too, it's really difficult to find a good ending and this one was one of those.<br />The writing was brilliant and the plot! Read it!
B00BCX2F66|3.0|Should have had some type of magnet to keep front cover closed.  Doesn't stay closed at all once used or bent back once. Htc needs to update this to be better suited. Might have been rushed. It is stylsh!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the plot, specially that it wasn't like anything I've read before. Some things didn't go as you expected (or wanted) them to, but that was one of the beauties of it.<br />The descriptions of everything, from the garments to the hair and make-up or the scenery... was amazing!<br />I didn't expect to love it so much.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|I loved the book and wondered how a film would portray such a story! I enjoyed every minute of it!
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I liked the book because it told how everything started and was very well told, however I expected a link between Thomas and the main characters in this story and I was wrong... though it's also a good thing because it wasn't predictable, I didn't expect the things that happened and I liked that.
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|There are a lot of great songs on this album and overall, the album lives up to its name.  It was nice to see a theme in most of the songs (save for Zac's beautiful melancholy song at the end), which is about embracing the moment.  Whether it's love, living for now, this album is all about capturing the moment and living for today.<br /><br />A couple of songs were overdone and had a little too much going on, but otherwise this album was a product of the continued evolution of Hanson music.  The only thing I was was different is that they would have incorporated more horns.  That really set Shout It Out apart from everyone else in the business and I hate to see that they mostly lost that on this album.
B00AQLGXTU|3.0|Definitely, an improvement of the previous one, mainly because she starts to realize that she has to make her mind and that she isn't the center of everybody's universe anymore. This book is less focus on the America and I liked it, but it isn't amazing either.<br />I like somewhat the story because I like reading romantic stories, and such but this book isn't in my top list: it's not thrilling, it didn't keep me thinking about what's going to happen and it gave the chance to read other books between &#34;breaks&#34; from this one.<br />The beginning is really slow and kind of boring but then it gets a little better.
0307719219|5.0|Read other books about the 2008 world wide financial crashes and then read this -it knits it all together. Centuries of historical perspective and it makes sense to an average reader.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi Carlile's songs and singing are addictive.  Modern folk with a high lonesome kick!  Good in the car or while kicking back.
B000W746GK|5.0|After reading the book, it was just as I expected. Classic H.P. Recommend to older children/ young adult. Great for families
B00CELB94E|5.0|Let me begin by stating that I got this album from the Beady Eye site.<br /><br />I liked Beady Eye's first album. I thought it was a good effort from the members. It was heavy, pure rock n roll. I think they came out with the album came out too soon after Oasis split, but at the time I was happy just to get new material. The album had some good stuff on it and I enjoyed it. Quick note - all those haters out there that compare Beady Eye to Noel please stop. They are different styles of music. I loved both and enjoy getting double the music.<br /><br />BE is much much better in my mind. The quality of the songs, the production, sounds, lyrics and overall sound is great.<br />Liam sounds better on this without many effects on his voice. His voice has gotten much better since it died in 2004, so well done Liam.<br /><br />This batch of songs are \\"mature\\" sounding. The 60s vibe along was done well and really fits in for the album sound.<br />Upon first listen of all the songs I really was not sure how I felt. After a second time through I loved all the song. You need to give the album a chance and let it grow on you.<br /><br />Flick of the Finger, Face the Crowd, Second Bite of the Apple, Soon Come Tomorrow, I'm Just Saying and Start Anew are the highlights of the album for any \\"common\\" listener that just wants to get the feel for this.<br /><br />To any fan of Oasis, Beady Eye, or Noel you need to give this a chance. The songs will grow on you. The bonus tracks are good as well. If you are an Oasis fan, then you know that B-sides are sometimes better than what was put on the album.
