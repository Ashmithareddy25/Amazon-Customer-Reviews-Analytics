B000OVLBGC|5.0|What a great movie in the best tradition of filmmaking.  I can't think of a single flaw.  Pitch perfect is the pacing, acting, writing and score.  This is a real life, genuine thriller wholly devoid of any action scenes.  It makes you think.  It helps you see the freedom you take for granted.  It shows you what happens when you let the ends (socialist utopia) justify the means (gestapo, statism).  Don't be so naive as to think it couldn't happen here--and know that the threat is from the left, not the right.
B001MYIXAC|1.0|Makes me fear for things in general that this kind of meandering, muddled mess could pass for a critically acclaimed film.  Absolutely nothing of value, embarrassingly bad acting and a script so vacuous and unthinking as to appeal only to the easily entertained.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|As always I loved this movie.  I bought it for my 8 year old because she loves High School Musical so much.  She loved it too.
B00003CX8Y|2.0|Pre order said it was new but when recived it had a Snow White security label the DVD turned out to be a burned copy of the original DVD. Some parts of the movie freeze up color quality is not so well. I own the original DVD picture quality is alot brighter than this purchase.
B000NA28I4|1.0|while its true that you cant adequately transfer a book to a movie, the makers of harry potter,iron man(i know its not a book but it still held true to the story line), etc have done it quite well. this movie absolutely butchered the books and the script would've been better suited for toilet paper. elves looked like the other humans, the herbalist looked like will smith from wild wild west scene, every thing just SUCKED!!
B001194F5K|5.0|Truly a unique and accurate look into the lives of women in Afghanistan before and after the Taliban rule.  An amazing depiction of the culture, country, and society but with an even more amazing story.  The author has an absolute amazing talent for story-telling and thank GOD he decided to use it.  I will never be the same after reading this book. My favorite quote from it is \\"Tell Aziza she is the noor of my eyes and sultan of my heart.\\"  I cried and cried after reading the last page.  This story will stick with you for a lifetime, I promise.
0743496736|4.0|Jodi Picoult's a really fine writer, and she really knows how to pack an emotional punch with her novels.  NINETEEN MINUTES is one of her stronger efforts, a story that deals with a schoolhouse shooting, very similar in style to the Columbine massacre.<br /><br />For the most part, NINETEEN MINUTES succeeds in tackling a very difficult subject.  Picoult excels at characterization and dialogue, and her writing achieves an emotional depth that few commercial writers can match.  I often don't feel a lot of strong emotion for fictional characters, but Picoult is a good enough writer that I experienced a lot of intense emotion (good and bad) toward toward many of the key characters in this novel.  This is a rare gift for a writer to have, which explains why Picoult is as successful as she is.<br /><br />On the minus side, the plot of NINETEEN MINUTES is ultimately quite formulaic.  The main theme of this novel is teenage bullying and its often disastrous consequences.  It's not very difficult to predict where the storyline is headed, and Picoult is not subtle in presenting her anti-bullying message.  In many ways, this book reminds me of those after-school specials I watched when I was an adolescent, where the theme was so obvious and repetitive that it undermined the power of the storyline.<br /><br />I was also disappointed with some of the stereotypical characterization in NINETEEN MINUTES.  The high school bullies are almost ridiculously evil and cruel, while their victim is almost Christ-like in his never-ending suffering.  While school bullying is a very real issue, I would have preferred to see it portrayed in a manner that wasn't quite so black and white.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, NINETEEN MINUTES is worth your time.  Picoult's a powerful writer, and I found myself swept up in the raw power of her storytelling.  This is a very involving book until the very end.  I've read several of Picoult's novels over the years, and I think this is the best of the bunch so far.

B001IF5YLQ|1.0|Apple has absolutely been asenine with this laptop. I purchased the laptop at CDW through a corporate program. I had to buy the WORTHLESS adapter there too. I will get to the worthless part in a moment but lets go over a few things first that are OBVIOUS FLAWS in the product.<br /><br />1. Who in their right mind makes an adapter that is so non flexible and bulky as this one, why does it need that extra 4 inches of cabling and that absurdly huge housing, I have seen DISPLAYPORT to DVI adapters that have a much smaller footprint.<br /><br />2. Apple must be on some sort of drugs for creating Mini Displayport all together, they should have just taken the VESA standard Display Port standard and slapped it into the laptop instead of stepping in and making yet ANOTHER crappy proprietary system.<br /><br />3. The all white \\"apple\\" look MUST GO, it attracts fingerprints scratches and whatnot and DOES NOT GO WELL with an ALUMINUM Laptop, hey Apple, throw us a bone here, give us an accessory that matches the stinking laptop!<br /><br />Those are the three most obvious flaws. Now we move onto the BIGGEST, and BADDEST, flaw of them all.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT DOES NOT LAST MORE THAN A MONTH. I don't know if others have this problem but I have been through 3 of these little turds in the last 3 months and they all fail after a month.<br /><br />Apple, your laptop rocks, your standards suck, and your adapters suck, FIX IT!<br /><br />Apple, I officially rate this product<br /><br />EPIC FAIL TO THE POWER OF EPIC INFINITY

630512762X|5.0|John Woo has always been a master behind the camera. But unfortunately his American films have never been so great. This is by far his best attempt at an American Hollywood Blockbuster. The story, the pace, the action are all beyond perfect in this amazing action thriller.<br /><br />John Travolta and Nicolas Cage star in this flick as two different men, one is the law and the other a criminal that wants to unleash terror. Who is who is for you to see, either way both will switch roles. To clarify for those who haven't seen it. Sean Archer (Travolta) is in urge for revenge after his son is murdered by a dangerous and insane terrorist known as Castor Troy (Cage). Castor is eventually captured by Archer...but he needs immediately the location of explosives that are ready to detonate. Since no one will tell him the location...he will have to become him. Literally.<br /><br />It seems sort of silly when you think about it, but the writers wrote the script in a fashion that we forget the disbelief and take it for what it is...a movie. Not to mention Woo's amazing gun fu sequences which are exhilarating! The best since Hard Boiled and The Killer. I honestly can't think of anything big to criticize about this flick, it's by far a perfect action movie. This is definitely a must see on a surround sound system. A must own by all means!!<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 5 OUT OF 5
B001FB55Y4|5.0|Watched the film. Loved it. Loved the music. Ordered it. Very pleased with it. Like any soundtrack, you can only love the music if you watched the movie. So please do watch it and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B0006J28KU|5.0|For the first time we get to witness the two finest actors in cinematic history in the same exact film. Even though both Pacino and De Niro had stared in the same film, Godfather Part 2, they were never in the same scenes. Here in Michael Mann's Electrifying Film \\"Heat\\" we get the honor of having them both together...though only for 10 min. Still there is so much more to the movie that will want you to revisit this film again and again.<br /><br />In Heat Pacino plays a cop, one that is so devoted to his work, that he barely has time for his wife and stepdaughter. The issue between his family is so grave that it's sinking him personally. To make matters worse, a professional thief (De Niro) has established a team to steal bearer bonds from a bank, and re sell them at a certain percentage, promising the bank that they will have a high investment. Pacino's character is so into this thief that he will do the impossible to take him down.  But wait, there is more, De Niro will prepare a smart maneuver to prepare what to me is the best heist in a movie.<br /><br />Heat is magnificently directed by Michael Mann, this is by far his best movie. the cinematography is so realistic and in your face. The action is choreographed and presented with out any flaws whatsoever. The Plot is crafted intelligently and by the book, with slick dialogue and clever editing.<br /><br />Unfortunately Heat is not without flaws, the movie has a double edge sword. The movie's pace can be at times very slow. I sometimes was eagerly awaiting for something to blow up...still that is what makes the picture so amazing, the pace...you need to listen and pay attention to the lines...its written so you can re-view the film and appreciate it more. The best part aside from the heist is the meeting between Pacino and De Niro at a restaurant. The dialogue is so well written. The best line by Pacino is \\"if I'm there and I gotta put you away, I won't like it. But I tell you, if it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow, brother, you are going down.\\"<br /><br />This is definitely a movie to own by all means. The only thing I advice is to pay attention and to have patience with it. It can be slow, but the action is sure there, and it delivers, to the max.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 5 OUT OF 5astard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow, brother, you are going down.\\"<br /><br />This is definitely a movie to own by all means.

B000FS9MV0|5.0|Renee really blows the doors off with this album.   She's right up there with June Christy,Ella, or Billie.   And the musicians in the her band could've easily played with Kenton, Basie, Herman or Goodman.   It's too bad you can't find a radio station that plays this kind of music, so cop a copy of this album, put it in your car radio, turn it way up, and pull the knobs off the dial.
B00003CY0V|3.0|It seems to me that after \\"The Matrix\\" hundreds of movies came out trying to mimic the success of it. Either simply by creating slow motion sequences, or by actually establishing a \\"wana be\\" plot. Here in this mess of a movie we get a semi-interesting plot that is converted into an over glossed picture. Every scene in this movie looks like it was taken from \\"the matrix\\" not in the action so much, but rather in the picture quality. The frames and angles look very similar to it. Interestingly they add credits that also resemble \\"the matrix\\".<br /><br />In Swordfish we have Gabriel Shear (John Travolta) a terrorist/Bank Robber. Shear is interested in some weird way to help our nation maintain its cycle of war...to help somehow. I don't know it's weird. What I do know is that he needs a man named Stan (Hugh Jackman) to help him create a worm. This worm will be placed electronically inside a computer to steal 9,500 million dollars. Along with this we have undercover DEA agents, a custody battle and alot more filer to continue this mess.<br /><br />The issue here is that the plot is silly, that they try to make it interesting. The only way they knew how was to create similar contrast in picture quality to \\"the Matrix\\" even adding lines that sound like it come from there. In a scene, a character says \\"He exists in a world beyond your world. What we only fantasize, he does. He lives a life where nothing is beyond him. Ok... is it just me or this kind of sounds like \\"Morpheus\\". No?<br /><br />The plot could have been handled if they gave the audience some incentive on how exactly the hacking procedure works. Instead we see them clicking and clicking there keyboards over and over, accepting there cyber talk, which makes the viewer think the movie is somewhat smart...when in fact it isn't. The twist is so stupid...yeah sure, a little creative, but to far fetch. The twist was a manageable way to hide the irrelevant action scenes and stupid heist that barely makes any sence. Travolta however, as always, plays the baddie as we want him to. It's just feels as if they took a rotten apple and over shined it, so it could seem intelligent and creative...it's just a dumb tech action movie. Rent, not buy.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5ays, plays the baddie as we want him to.

B001P3SA94|4.0|I have always had a deep love for Rock 'N Roll beginnings, but I am far from a historian of it. Therefore I can't say how accurate the \\"who did whats\\" are nor can I tell you who specifically may have been left out. For example, since this movie was basically the story of Chess Records I did not know to be all up-in-arms about the absence of Bo Diddly. I know performers not what label they were signed to. My review is of the movie as a story, which was much better that i was expecting. My only problem with this movie was Beyonce's singing performances. The rest of her acting was fine, but after seeing so many music documentary type films in the recent years, I found her singing performances painful to watch and listen to. I have never been a fan of the extended note yodeling that is so prominent in modern R&B, so naturally hearing her cover versions were disappointing. What made it worse was how obviously out of sync they were. I understand that a live performance will not likely be used in a feature film, but if you going to lip-sync to your cover of a classic then you better nail it. I also realize this could easily have nothing to do with Beyonce. The responsibility could fall entirely to the editing room. However, I can't help but go back to how many times it has been done successfully in recent years. Cadillac Records FAILS at this. Otherwise it is a very good story and a pleasure to watch.

Big Bang is at the top of the list.This show has excellent writing,excellent character development,and excellent acting.The 1st year was great and the 2nd is just as good.This is one series that you can watch over and over and it's just as enjoyable as the first time.
B001B67VR2|5.0|Despite all that this woman is going through this album is by far her best album and maybe the best pop/ R&B album out there.  Most of the songs on this album get a lot of radio play.

B001V9LRTM|4.0|I just watched the video above about bringing in some Santana band members (and in one case the son of a band member) to re-record some percussion parts for the 40th Anniv Woodstock blu-ray/dvd.  I am the only person who has a problem with this?  I think that if you have to re-record music today to make footage from 1969 usable, the footage shouldn't be included in the movie.  If the music isn't original, it's not authentic, and if it's not authentic, what's the point?

B000X5SPBI|5.0|Season three picks up right were season two left off. The brothers are trying hard to clean up the mess they made and to keep Dean alive. We also get to follow Sam as he perhaps inches further to the dark side. In terms of story line season three does not dissapoint; lots of angst, drama, and those pained long looks we true fans love. Season three also has what is probably the best comedic episode of the entire series so far \\"Ghostfacers!\\". The down side? The extras are sparce at best and there are fewer episodes. This was writter strike season and i'd say it affected the bonus material. Thankfully the season is meaty enough that the faux pas is forgivible.

B00026WU7I|5.0|Dylan had released a series of less than perfect releases, then he really out did himself on this one.  The songs are poignant and telling, the instrumentation is minimalist, and Dylan makes a great return.  \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\" is a great opening tune that received much radio play. \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" and \\"You're a Big Girl Now\\" are great love songs. Dylan wails on \\"Idiot Wind\\" (\\"They say I killed a man named Gray, and took his wife to Italy. She inherited a million bucks, and when she died it came to me.  I can't help it if I'm lucky\\"). \\"You're Going to Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" is a joyous Dylan love song.  \\"Buckets of Rain\\" is a somber tune that concludes the release.  This is a great disk, that shows Dylan's poignant side.
B00003CXBH|4.0|This movie moved me (no pun intended) on a number of levels as its theme of hypocrisy, greed, betrayal and the inhumanity and cruelty of man hits home hard and yet I couldn't help but feel that it was a little too short at just a little over 2 hours long.  Perhaps this film too was a victim of commercial factors and that it was edited to this time frame but if ever a film would be better off for being longer it would have to be this one.<br /><br />I felt the characters didn't have time to develop enough and that this fine wine didn't get to breathe before we were forced to drink it.  I felt DeNiro's story at the beginning and his character could have benefitted from some development and I would have liked to have seen more of the everyday life of the tribe and their spiritual development.<br /><br />For this reason, I hope a good Director's Cut Blu-ray version is released soon as this movie if given the chance to slowly unravel has the potential to be at least as good as \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".  This doesn't mean that this is a bad film in any way but it certainly could have been at least a little bit better.  In fact it is a testimony to how good this film is in that I'm actually asking for it to be at least 3 hours long instead of wishing the running length to be shorter as I do for many other films.<br /><br />As someone from Portuguese/Asian descent who is also Catholic; this film moved me greatly as it reminded me of how imperfect some of my ancestors both of descent and of faith were and I was actually very sad by many of the scenes.  The fact that Portugal still allowed slavery even after Spain \\"abolished\\" it sickens me and the fact that the Church had so little faith in their beliefs to engage tragically in the politics of the time to totally pervert Christ's teachings leaves me also with great disappointment.<br /><br />The Cardinal's inexplicable decision to not protect the innocent and Christ's little innocent ones from effectively what became Satan's minions showed his great lack of faith in the very religion he professes to follow.  His misplaced concern that the Jesuits would be wiped out of existance as being a worthy reason to commit a gross sin of omission and allow genocide for greed sickened me.  If it was God's will to protect the Jesuits, nothing would have threatened them and all they needed to do was to do the simple command of Jesus to go forth and spread the Gospel to the ends of the earth.  Jeremy Irons does this to the bitter end and hence imitates Christ the best while everyone else ironically does the opposite and does Satan's work in the name of Christ.  I found the scene where even the Blessed Sacrament is shot at to be the most touching as \\"followers\\" of Christ actually shoot at Him.  This film will stay with me for a long time as I ponder the many aspects over time.<br /><br />This dvd is very well put together as well as I really like the mostly cardboard packaging and the bonus dvd is a real treat describing the making of the film as well as highlighting how natives in South America are still being abused and exploited to this day.  The picture quality is very good and so is the sound quality although I would repeat that a longer, Director's Cut version restored both picture and sound-wise in Blu-ray would be a real treat.  With the 25th anniversary of the film due in a couple of years time, this would be a good opportunity to do such a project.<br /><br />I wait with bated breath!<br /><br />Recommended!ons showed his great lack of faith in the very religion he professes to follow.

Three things I wanted to jam into my face while this album played. If you have ears, and if you haven't been conditioned by the mindless drivel played incessantly on all of the rappophiphopyuppysex stations out there, then go spend an hour listening to pigs being slaughtered, or trains colliding, or deaf people shrieking, or amp feedback, or just shove a needle deep into your ear and soak up the pain. It'll prove more beneficial to you than even a minute of this whore of an album.
B001GKO45K|5.0|Triumph of the Will is propaganda without a doubt.  It chronicles the 6th Congress at Nuremburg along with scenes from parades and Nazi Youth Camps without any of the hate speech that you would expect to see in a film starring Adolf Hitler.    I watched this as part of a project.  After searching the web for awhile, I found a couple other great films about this time and in particular, Adolf Hitler that you should also watch if you are doing a project or even if you are a history fan.  Shortly after this film was released, [[ASIN:B001PN1DXE Dealers in Death (Enhanced) 1935]] was released.  This documentary has a central idea that even though Europe is at war with one another, the munitions works that are located withing those countries, work together to maximize profits and prolong the war.  It is very interesting and an amazingly timed piece.  For a comedic look at Hitler, Moussilini & Japanese Commander Suki Yaki, check out Nazty Nuissance.      If you want some great flicks about the consequences off the war, check out [[ASIN:B001NFSP08 Night and Fog (Enhanced Edition) 1955]], [[ASIN:B00005BJWC Escape From Sobibor]] or [[ASIN:6305075573 Open City]].

B001DHXT1G|5.0|The summer of 2008 proved to be an extremely lucrative one for Marvel with the one-two punch of \\"Iron Man\\" followed by \\"The Incredible Hulk\\". Granted in terms of monetary value and profit margin, Marvel gained more from \\"Iron Man\\" than their second attempt at adapting the not-so jolly green giant for the big screen. Even so, under their new Marvel Studios filmmaking branch it seems that the self-proclaimed \\"House of Ideas\\" is off to a terrific start, and has chosen to make very solid, entertaining film adaptations that hold true to their source material. As some of you may remember, and no doubt many of you did (due to the lower box office totals, I would say it's safe to say most of you did), Marvel's previous attempt to adapt their angry jade \\"hero\\" didn't exactly go over very well with comic book fans and general moviegoers, essentially making \\"Hulk\\" into Marvel's first flop of the new comic book movie age.    Which brings us to Marvel's second, yet first self-produced, remake \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" (their first re-do was 2004's \\"The Punisher\\"). To me the film would be more accurately viewed as Marvel's way of saying, \\"We are incredibly sorry for stealing away two hours of your life with the psycho-babble in Ang Lee's whine-fest of an excuse for a movie.\\" But that tagline for the film would probably be too long and distracting. Thus, we now find ourselves with yet another Hulk movie on our hands, but is this film all that different from what came before? In a word...yes. The difference between the two adaptations is basically as follows:  unlike 2003's \\"Hulk\\" (Ang Lee's version, for those not keeping up) this new film knows what it takes to make the character work for audiences. Although it's really a shame that this Hulk wasn't able to smash so much more at the box office (we can all thank Ang Lee for ruining that possibility), after all the character's potential was fully and spectacularly realized in this adaptation.    \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" tells the story ofbrilliant scientist Bruce Banner, who has been living in secrecy from the prying eyes of the United States government for several years as he attempts to rid himself of a very strong curse...the Hulk that resides within. After some unfortunate events lead to the military discovering his whereabouts, Banner soon discovers that he has no choice but to stand and fight against those who would use the monster within him as a weapon of destruction.    After I watched this film there was only one string of thoughts I had running through my mind, \\"Now, that is what an Incredible Hulk movie is all about! Intense action, plenty of drama, bits of romance and comedy sprinkled throughout, not to mention a talented cast of actors and actresses, and visual effects that will blow you away. If you haven't been able to forget about Ang Lee's travesty, then you haven't seen this film yet.\\" Well, maybe my thoughts weren't exactly like that, but they were similar in nature, I know that for a fact.    Anyways, let's begin by discussing the actors chosen to bring their respective comic book counterparts to life on the big screen. Each cast member was perfectly chosen, even if the choice didn't seem that obvious from the get-go. For instance, actor Edward Norton (\\"American History X\\") was not my first choice for Bruce Banner/The Hulk, and even after the initial trailers were released I still wasn't sure if he could do some of the non-Hulk action that the film was clearly calling for. I do not doubt that Edward could handle the dramatic side of the character, but all the running, jumping, and even some fighting were not things this actor is normally known for in his work. However, I am more than willing to admit that I was mistaken in my uncertainty regarding his abilities, and Norton truly owned the role of Banner. He imbues this tortured soul with such an anxious intensity and passion for finding a cure that the audience fully understands and relates to everything he is going through. Beneath all the angst over his curse, Norton also reveals a man broken down by his lot in life and the sacrifices he's been forced to make to protect those he loves from himself. Every aspect of Edward's portrayal was perfectly in keeping with the character's emotions, motivations, and thought processes in the comic books.    Joining Edward Norton is the talented veteran actor William Hurt (\\"A History of Violence\\") portraying the man hunting Bruce Banner, General Thaddeus \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross. This casting choice made perfect sense to me, as William always seems to immerse himself into any character thrown his way, and it's that very dedication to his craft that made him the prime candidate for this modern day Captain Ahab. William delivers a performance that is rife with an intense hatred that drives him forward on his borderline nihilistic mission to capture Banner and unleash the beast. Assisting Ross in this dangerous endeavor is Tim Roth (TV's \\"Lie to Me\\") as Emil Blonsky, a military man past his prime, yet still thriving on the thrill of battle. Roth creates in Blonsky a warrior without any sense of remorse, in essence a sociopath whose mindset makes him both the ideal soldier for Ross' mission and the perfect weapon for the general to throw into the Hulk's path.    Lastly, actress Liv Tyler (\\"Armageddon\\") as Betty Ross was even more of a maligned pick in my book than Edward Norton. I've never been all that taken by Liv in any of her roles, and even after her performance here (which is very good by the way) I still would have preferred Jennifer Connelly (who portrayed Betty in Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\"), but that is driven more by her appearance than anything else. That being said, Liv does a very good job with Betty, giving her plenty of dimension and depth of character, making her much more than just the damsel in distress. She's very much an independent woman, and her portrayal is one that is probably more believable, in terms of appearance, than that of Jennifer Connelly, who let's face it didn't really look like she would actually be a scientist.    The story for \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" was written by Zak Penn (\\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\") and co-written (although not credited) by Edward Norton. This adaptation of the Hulk was much more faithful to the comics that inspired it, no doubt influenced by the fact that Marvel itself was financing the picture. Unlike its predecessor, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" opted for a much more streamlined approach to the origin story, something that other comic book adaptations could take to heart. What took Ang Lee two hours or more to create, this script accomplished in a much more concise, and altogether clearer manner. Gone is all the psycho-babble, daddy issues of \\"Hulk\\", and in their place we have a crystal clear storyline, full of character-driven drama that is both gripping and intriguing, loaded with action and spectacle, plus a flawed hero that is much more believable and charismatic than anything the former could muster. On every single level \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" delivers a top-notch story that comic book fans have always hoped for, and all their loyalty and patience has been brilliantly rewarded.    Directing this latest adaptation we have action director Louis Letterier (\\"Unleashed\\"). For Ang Lee's vision of the Hulk's story, we were treated to some very stylistic, yet questionable choices about the editing and look of the overall film. Louis Letterier wisely chose to avoid over-stylizing the movie, opting for more of a down-and-dirty action film that felt much grittier and even realistic (which is an odd thing to say when discussing a movie that's subject is a giant green monster). Truly the only stylized element Letterier brought to the film, in my opinion, were his trademark fast-paced, quick cut action scenes that are designed to heighten the intensity of the moment even more than what the story was doing on its own. It's a gimmick used by many filmmakers today to assist in creating even more powerful action-heavy sequences, and it is probably one that is used far too often as a crutch more than anything else. However, Letterier has mastered the art of the quick cut, and deftly uses it to his advantage in every film he directs, and \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is no exception.    Finally, the visual effects for this incarnation of Hulk is leaps and bounds above anything featured in Ang Lee's version (this should be the last comparison to that film). The talented people at Rhythm and Hues were responsible for creating the surprisingly lifelike CGI creations of Hulk and Abomination. Truthfully, making an audience believe that a giant green monster is actually present amongst humans cannot be an easy endeavor; however, the stunning visual effects work done in this film (similar to what was done for \\"King Kong\\") is as close to creating a realistic human-esque monster as we can probably get (at least for a little while). Out of all the CGI-intensive films released in 2008, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" boasted the very best the industry had to offer, and it was a shame that the film and its creative geniuses weren't recognized for it this last award season.    \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is a fast-moving, intense action film that boasts some of the most impressive visuals you will see in a film for quite some time. This movie effectively recreates the film version of the character to be more inline with his comic book counterpart, becoming the definitive Hulk for audiences to enjoy watching for years to come.    \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.
0060989157|4.0|Motley Crue was one of the bands that provided the happy soundtrack to my misspent late teens and early 20's. Originally dissed as little more than a New York Dolls knockoff, the Crue went on to sell millions of records and stump the critics, who would eventually give them some grudging respect as their sound and image evolved. They still stalk the charts and concert venues today, giving proof that they are indeed, survivors. (As I write this review, Cruefest 2's summer stadium jaunt is taking shape).<br /><br />This really is a pretty incredible book. Each chaper gives voice to one of the members of the band, or alternately one of the people who was close to them during their heyday. (I really give them props for including these other voices. Ex-managers are given space, as is former lead singer John Corabi.) Starting at the beginning, the book chronicles the misadventures of the boys as they form the band, struggle to stand out in the crowded LA glam scene, and move from one excess to another as the band succeeds, implodes, succeeds again, implodes again, and on and on. Road stories abound. Sexual escapades are chronicled in graphic detail. Vince's tragic auto accident is told with stunning detail. I can go on and on, but these guys really cover some ground.<br /><br />I was also really impressed that these guys had real, human stories to tell. Mick Mar's battle with ankylosing spondylitis is harrowing. Vince Neil lost his daughter to cancer. Nikki Sixx descended into massive drug abuse and lived to tell. Tommy.....well, he married Pamela Lee, 'nuff said. All of these events are dealt with in this book.<br /><br />Co-author Neil Strauss did a great job of transcribing the tales and getting them down on paper. My only misgiving is that there weren't more pictures. All in all though, a great and compelling read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Highly recommended.

B000002IFP|5.0|For many years this is a CD I have passed on again and again.Common perception has it that after their debut nothing Simply Red did in the 80's ever matched up.Well if the previous album [[ASIN:B000025U2V Men and Women]] focused more on strong funky grooves then crafting strong pop/soul tunes this one finds solid ground on both accounts.The band is augmented again to keep the music from becomming sterile,a bit of a problem with some blue eyed soul of the late 80's. And artistically speaking this album definately will triumph for anyone who appreciates soulful,funky music to the highest degree.What really gets me is how coherent AND stylistically diverse this album is;the musical styles showcased come from the usual soul,funk,jazz but there is more here then that. You have funky,catchy uptempo tunes such as \\"It's Only Love\\",\\"To Be With You\\" and \\"Turn It Up\\" but you also have songs like the wonderful,determined title song which actually puts a bit of that Habanero/Spanish rhythm back into a mildly jazzy style that....well had pretty much been forgotton since the very earliest days of jazz music itself in New Orleans.And here it is in an 80's pop context,so it really does come back around sometimes.On songs like \\"More\\" and \\"She'll Have To Go\\" a similar feeling is mixed with a reggae style. It's really enjoyable and ear catching how Heitor T.P uses rhythm guitar on these tunes,sometimes in the traditional sense,others almost burried below with an echoey,bubbling sound as if he's playing underwater. Whatever you call it it sounds great here. The quality that most earlier Simply Red fans will find appealing here will likely be the fact that the three ballads included are the strongest since the \\"Holding Back The Years\\" days;\\"You've Got It\\" is a great example.\\"So is \\"Love Lays It's Tune\\",even if that's a bit churchier.A cover of \\"If You Don't Know Me By Now\\" is...well a great cover tune.Not really needed outside the band paying tribute to the past,kind of a clishe of the era but it's well done. The albums ending is one of the most unique songs Simply Red have done up to this point;\\"Enough\\" has an elongated,jazzy soul feel to it with some great vocal harmonizing and a wonderful piano solo by the always excellent Joe Sample,who also co-wrote the tune with Hucknall. It's kind of a shame that aside from their first classic hit Simply Red somehow got a bit lost in the huge wave of British Soul which,with all of it's artists and all of it's forms baught everyone from Culture Club,Spandau Ballet,Level 42,Duran Duran and The Style Council into the mix.Simply Red were likely among the poppier of these bands overall;all could produce pop singles but became more experimental in different ways on their album tracks. You can for whatever point being made say that Simply Red were able to stretch a strong pop craft over the course of an entire album the way the do here. Even if it's been somewhat forgotton and left to the used CD bins of the world that doesn't make the music inside any less worthwhile.f a clishe of the era but it's well done.

B000V86OKG|4.0|I wondered after seeing season 1 of \\"Dexter\\" how they would follow it up. It was worth waiting for! Even though it occasionally seems awkward, the second season really is an interesting look for anyone who wondered if Dex was really going to get away scot-free with dumping body after body in the same place for so long. Not only did his little secret get discovered, now his odd behavior finally raised Rita's radar so he has to make up a story...which only causes more problems in his personal life! We also get a look at how Deb is recovering from her ordeal with Dexter's brother, and she gets some help dealing from the FBI agent assigned to lead the task force investigating Dexter's \\"friends\\" from the ocean floor. (At one point, Dexter refers to him as \\"Special Agent Rockstar\\" due to his prowess with solving serial killings.) We get a glimpse of a few other characters as well & I'm very excited for Season 3 to become available on DVD, as we don't have Showtime. Besides, with DVD, there's no commercials. :)

B00000J048|5.0|Purchased a set for my Head Start classroom, and think I may have to get another one.  Really popular with my little ones who just aren't old enough for traditional learning styles. These gears are great for individual or cooperative group projects, lend themselves to creative and ingenious configurations, and encourage persistence. Imagine what the kids could do with twice as many to work with!  I did leave off the decals that came with the set - entirely too much visually.

B001B1T7BU|5.0|Disney did an excellent job adapting this story from the 1961 version.  It's true to the original, and yet adds a few new flavors.  The acting was good, and Glen Close did an excellent job playing Cruella. But the very best thing about this film, other than the adorable canines, are the values it teaches children.  Not only does it encourage kindness to animals, but it also reveals the ugliness of killing animals for their coats. I hope that all who view this film will think twice before they don another fur.  In short, I highly recommend this film for family viewing.
1439136653|1.0|Contrived, trite little novel.  Not very well written.  I didn't even finish it.  Don't waste your money and time.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but it has got to be better than this.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love the movie SPIRITED AWAY by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. It's a breath taking anime film about a young girl, Chihiro, who is literally \\"spirited away\\" to a nether world full of magical beings and fantastic possibilities. She must stay and work at a bathhouse for spirits because a witch has turned her parents into pigs. With courage, hope, love, and the help of a boy named Haku, Chihiro must find a way to outsmart the witch and rescue herself and her parents from this realm and return to the human world.<br /><br />Just like another reviewer pointed out, beneath the surface this film is also about not judging people at face value because there's good and bad in all of the characters, and in us. Chihiro seems to understand that and therefore has compassion for even the most frightening and evil spirits/characters that pop up in the movie and helps them. And even though she might be afraid of them, she doesn't judge them. Perhaps that's the real message of the film and why people find it so endearing...<br /><br />The English dub is fantastic and Daveigh Chase as \\"Chihiro,\\" Jason Marsden as \\"Haku,\\" and the fabulous Suzanne Pleshette as evil witch \\"Yubaba\\" are terrific in their respective roles.

B000GIWS6U|5.0|After their enormous success in 1967 with several big single hits and the success of their first European album, there were big expectations for their second album \\"Horizontal\\"<br /><br />The album may at times come out slightly rushed with songs of uneven qualities, unlike their very consisten debut. On the other hand there is also an overall more convincing \\"band-feel\\" to the album.<br /><br />The two big hits \\"World\\" and \\"Massachusetts\\" need no special mention - both being fine examples of early Bee Gees sound<br /><br />Some of the ballads like \\"Really and Sincerely\\" come out too heavily orchestered with strings etc. - but there is a good handful of songs, where you get the feeling that this was really a band at this point. \\"The Earnest of Being George\\" and \\"Lemons Never Forget\\" are unusually raw for Bee Gees songs, and \\"Change is Made\\" may very well the closest the Bee Gees ever came to recording a blues. The simple arrangement for the simple melodic \\"Birdie Told Me\\"  isvery nice, too.<br /><br />On the second bonus CD there are some real gems too. \\"Barker of the UFO\\", \\"Sir Geoffrey Saved the World\\" and \\"Sinking Ships\\" and great examples of the often very high standards of the groups B-sides. And of course, \\"Words\\" - another big hit for the band.<br /><br />Among the previously unreleased songs I really like \\"Out of Line\\" and the Christmas recordings are surprisingly good too. Another fine release, with a booklet telling part two of the band's early history - of course to be continued on \\"Idea\\"
B0000AUHQT|3.0|A lavish cast, impeccable landscape, flawless costumes, a classic novel, Frances Ford Coppola (at the writer's desk); recipe for success, right?  Well, I thought so too, but when all was said and done, `The Great Gatsby' appeared as nothing more than a pretty picture.  It is void of any real character development, casting aside the heart of the films central cast for the likes of pretty dresses, snazzy suits and beautiful music.  Sure, `The Great Gatsby' isn't all bad, but it surely isn't `great'.<br /><br />The story is your classic love triangle.  Daisy is married to Tom.  Tom is unfaithful, giving the majority of his love to Myrtle, who is the unhappy housewife of the poor George.  Daisy at one time was in love with Jay, who also happened to be poor, and so when he went off to the war she married Tom, who is not poor.  Now Jay is back, and he is rather wealthy, and so Daisy begins her affair with him.  All of this is seen and observed by Nick, Daisy's cousin and Jay's neighbor, who just so happens to narrate the story for us; the audience.<br /><br />What is sad about this adaptation is that the story really doesn't unveil itself to be anything deeper than what I just typed in the above paragraph.  There is little more that is embellished in regards to the core of these relationships.  Everything appears as mere surface.  It's there simply to justify having a film made, the focus being more on the flashy costumes and splendid musical arrangements.<br /><br />One aspect of the film that does work in it's favor is the acting, especially by the supporting cast.  Robert Redford and Mia Farrow are nice to look at, and Farrow does have some nicely crafted moments, but for the most part they are the least interesting characters and the least impressive actors.  Redford is always someone who bores me (except in a few films, like `The Sting') and so I wasn't surprised at the fact that he left me cold and distant here.  Farrow has her moments, but she also has a lot of stiff scenes.  Bruce Dern, Karen Black, Scott Wilson, Sam Waterston and the ravishing Lois Chiles are a different story though.  Dern is amazing as Tom, the coldhearted husband to Daisy; and Black just ignites as his lover.  Chiles is probably my favorite here, her distilled sensuality just entices me to keep watching her.  Sam Waterston was the perfect choice for Nick, for he has this almost chilled demeanor that makes for a worthy observer.  You can see him judging, if only from a distance, and thus he allows us to grasp what he sees without manipulating our own feelings.<br /><br />So, I'd recommend this for the stellar performances and crisp visuals alone, but if you are looking for a film that will stimulate you mentally as well as visually then you might want to look elsewhere.  It is a truly tragic and moving story, but this film adaptation doesn't capture that as well as it should have.ff scenes.

B001N26GFC|4.0|I've never heard so much gripping and moaning as I did the day the Oscar nominations were announced and Sally Hawkins was snubbed the Best Actress nomination.  She had been labeled the front runner even though everyone and their mother knew that no one outside of Streep had a remote chance of stealing Winslet's much deserved Oscar away, but still, Hawkins stamp in the awards race was too large to ignore.  She swept the precursors, winning almost every actress award imaginable and so when she was denied even a nomination come Oscar morning it was not only odd, it was shameful.<br /><br />Even though I would have still handed the Oscar to Winslet, the fact that Hawkins was snubbed rubs me wrong as well.<br /><br />After having watched this delightful little film a few times now I can honestly say, that while the film may not be as deep or even as eventful as I would have hoped, it is far from the shallow farce many have labeled it.  I understand that Hawkins' performance will not be deemed a masterpiece by all, and those who label her nothing more than annoying and aggravating are not entirely wrong in their conclusion and thus I cannot fault them.  Her performance is not for everyone, but one has to be able to look at the achievement apart from the character and realize that she single handedly CREATED this character from the ground up; and despite all of Poppy's manic mannerisms and her annoyingly delightful demeanor there is a sadness that lurks in the quiet moments (that scene with the bum just wrecked me) and Hawkins marvelously unveils that for us.<br /><br />The film seems to be void of any real plot.  Poppy is an eccentric school teacher (I really wish I were in her class) who decides it's about time she learns to drive.  She takes lessons every Saturday from Scott, an angry and controlling man who may or may not have a thing for Poppy despite his apparent annoyance with her cheeriness.  That's really it.  There is a side plot involving an unruly student and a counselor who happens to strike Poppy's fancy, but aside from that the main focus of the film is Poppy's driving lessons.  It's within these lessons that we get to the heart of Leigh's script, that interaction between someone incessantly optimistic and someone who is a stark contrast; direly pessimistic.<br /><br />I wish that the rest of the cast, namely Eddie Marsan, could have stood up to Hawkins brilliance but sadly she is the only shining light here.  Marsan couldn't embrace his character the way I wanted him to and he just came off as rather caricaturist and hammy.  This is a true testament to Hawkins' talent, for her character had all the makings of a caricature but instead she reigns it all in to create someone truly three dimensional and pure.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen a little more out of the script, which could have easily embellished on the root of Poppy's spirit with a little more intelligence.  It leaves gateways for the audience to understand her, but in the end it only satisfies our curiosity minimally in my personal opinion.  The final confrontation scene with Scott is very enlightening and it makes me wish that there had been a little more of that form of tension or confrontation in the film.  It is almost too chipper at times, thus taking away from the emotional heart of the story.<br /><br />In the end `Happy-go-Lucky' is very lucky that it has such a happy star, really, for Hawkins carries this film on her back and makes for one truly delightful experience.  It could have been better had it focused a little more on the core of Poppy herself, but as far as comedic fare goes, there are few that are this rewarding.to strike Poppy's fancy, but aside from that the main focus of the film is Poppy's driving lessons.

B001U0HBPQ|3.0|Walking into `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' I was excited.  I had read the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald and so my appetite was wet.  Not only that, but the film had been raved by many as the best of the year; it was winning all sorts of awards and looked prime for the Best Picture Oscar.  Aside from that, I am a huge fan of Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt and so I think it is safe to say that `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' looked like it just may be the perfect movie to me.<br /><br />In a world filled with the same ol' same it is always refreshing to see a film with such an original prose.<br /><br />Truth be told, when walking into a film so widely hyped and anticipated one is often setting themselves up for disappointment, which is sad because one is not able to separate hype from the actual experience long enough to gather their own individual (un-manipulated) feelings on the matter.  That is precisely why I loathe writing a review so soon after seeing a film, without fully processing it as a whole, and it is precisely why I wait until a films DVD release to give my final collected thoughts.<br /><br />Sadly, with `Benjamin', I couldn't wait.<br /><br />Walking out of `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' I felt a little cold.  Many critical reviews of the film labeled that the films solitary weakness; that it left you emotional detached.  It was less that and more emotionally robbed I think.  I wanted to feel attachment and I wanted to feel moved, but I didn't.  There are moments (especially with regard to Benjamin's decisions about `family') that play with the heart strings and can bring tears, but the films delivery is at such a stagnant pace that it makes it difficult to find an emotional foundation.  Brad Pitt's performance, while solid, is at times almost lifeless and this can add to the lack of emotional chemistry with the audience.  He tells us how one should be feeling (in a very slick and enjoyable voice over) but we can never truly grasp what Benjamin is feeling because he is so closed off.<br /><br />He is merely an observer, letting us see the journey of his life but never truly letting us experience it with him.  Someone mentioned the word `canvas', that Benjamin was a blank canvas on which those around him painted the story of their lives.  That sounds about right, for it is the people around Benjamin that engage us the most.<br /><br />Having read the short story I of course have my qualms with the films adaptation, minor as they may be.  Let me first say that the film is drastically different from the story, which is shocking since the short story was expertly crafted.  Having Benjamin grow up in a nursing home under the care of a foster mother was an inspired departure from the story, and it gave way to some nice character development on the part of Benjamin, Daisy and of course his foster mother Queenie.  I am not upset about this alteration one bit.  In fact, I am delighted with it.  My main complaint with the films departure from printed page comes in the films end, (and subsequently the films `modern day' beginnings) and the way that Benjamin's `family' is handled.<br /><br />I'll scream SPOILERS...just so you are aware.<br /><br />In the story the real meat of Fitzgerald's moral comes from the way Benjamin is regarded by his loved ones once he becomes `younger' than they are.  Whether it is Daisy's disgust with her younger husband merely because he is a constant reminder of her age or his children's disgust with their father beings that they must now take care of him, the story's major wind is found in its ending.  I won't say how this film ends, but let's just say that the choice made my Button in regards to his family, while emotional upon impact, is much less effective or enlightening as Fitzgerald's original prose.<br /><br />On another note in regards to the ending, I felt as if it was trying to make up for the films overall stiffness by giving us that sentimental monologue thatjust didn't fit (\\"some people dance\\").<br /><br />The films biggest conundrum is David Fincher, the films director.  I am a huge fan of his work and was very excited to see him garnering the respect and admiration he has so long deserved, but this is not the film for which he should have received it.  He may deliver the film to us almost like a poet, but his poem is almost devoid of real substance.  It is very fluid and very `epic' yet it still feels very small.  I told a friend that this was a small story given epic treatment yet it still comes off like a small film.  This is a blessing and a malediction, for the film has the intimate qualities of an independent film with the visual grandeur of an epic Hollywood escapade.  That's the blessing.  The malediction comes from the fact that, while it boasts the visual splendor (an area in which it excels) it never takes full advantage of the intimacy it possesses.  There are so many quiet moments within `Button' that feel lost.  There is a delicate side story containing the marvelous Tilda Swinton that is probably the most effective and `complete' portion of the film, and it made me sad because the rest of the film lacked the sharpness that that sequence of events contained.  When you watch the film you may not immediately see what I'm pointing out (although if you read this before you watch the film then you might see it front and center) so I can't fault it too much.  Fincher does some phenomenal work here visually, but emotionally he drops the ball.<br /><br />It is beautiful to look at, each frame floating by like clouds.  Nothing is choppy; nothing is rigid; every frame is smooth and delicate and comforting.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned, it is solid but never truly noteworthy.  Brad Pitt is a very capable actor, but like I've already mentioned, his delivery of Benjamin is more of an observer, not a participant.  Cate Blanchett is stunning in scenes, downright captivating at times, but goes cold towards the films end, where sentiment would have been most effective, and this put me off a bit.  Tilda Swinton and Taraji P. Henson give the most inspired performances here.  Swinton makes the most of her small screen time to deliver a truly touching performance, and Henson uses her charm and fiery deliver to add a glimmer of life to her scenes that are captivating and utterly essential.  I also enjoyed Jason Flemyng's portrayal of Benjamin's father Thomas, and I was so excited that the screenwriters still worked in Benjamin's relationship with his father even though they changed his living arrangements.<br /><br />As many have already noted about this film though, it is not an actor's showcase.  This is a technical achievement if nothing else, and technically it is splendid.  Fincher has crafted what may very well be his most technically proficient film.  It's just a shame that that proficiency was not carried on into the heart of the film.  Fincher failed to balance out the two ends of his film and thus delivered to us a beautifully shot yet emotionally vapid film.<br /><br />I did like this movie, and maybe over time I will see it differently.  I just don't love it like I thought I would have.  It could have been improved upon had Pitt delivered a little more life to Benjamin.  It also would have been preferable to have some of the films center trimmed to allow more depth given to the films end, which is really the most important part of the story.  I cannot knock this movie entirely (and I'm sorry if it looks like I'm ripping it to shreds in parts of this review) because it is entertaining and enjoyable and very beautifully directed; but I must call it out for its missteps and at least be true to my own opinions.  I'd watch it again, most definitely, but the film feels sorely like a missed opportunity.<br /><br />I just want to close out by saying that while I wrote this review months ago, after my first viewing of the film, I have since revisited the film and reviewed my review and I agree with every word.it.

B000WQWPKA|1.0|I have to say that I'm a big fan of this film, and I already own the DVD. Most of those wanting to buy this film on Bluray are those who have already seen it and liked it, so I won't comment on the movie content itself, but rather the technical and supplemental aspects of this release.    I borrowed a friend's copy of the BD version of ID4 just a few weeks ago, as I was contemplating whether to add this to my small but growing blu-ray collection. The picture and audio are superb, and watching this on my new LCD at 1080p with the lossless DTS-MA audio track really transported me back to the July of '96, when I watched this on the big screen. This movie has certainly aged well these thirteen years, and the special effects are still terrific even today. While watching, I was pretty much set on adding this to my collection.    That is, until after I finished watching the movie and wanted to see the extras in HD.    The DVD version I have contains two discs and a lot of extras, including an alternate ending, making-of feature, trailers, and cast/crew interviews. Sadly, in this BD release there are none, not even in standard definition. The only \\"extra\\" is a commentary track, which, as an another reviewer already pointed out, is laughably outdated. At $25, I would expect more than just a movie and nothing else.    The Dark Knight BD had two discs plus a digital copy for the same price-  that was justifiable, even in this economy. This... isn't.    FOX is notorious for double-dipping their DVD and Blu-ray releases. I would imagine that a two-disc or dual-layered \\"special edition\\" version will come out over the next year or so.    Needless to say, this BD release is quite a disappointment.
031606792X|1.0|My teenage sister had me read these books and I have to say I liked them well enough. When each of the following books to the Twilight series first came out I couldn't get enough. I read each of them in three days flat. Then Breaking Dawn came out. It took me a week and a half. My first problem with the book was the timeline from the wedding until Bella and Edward's mutant daughter was born. In the book they get married August 13th, go on a honeymoon for 17 days, find out Bella is pregnant come home, Bella gives birth, becomes a vampire and after her non-exsisent \\"newborn\\" vampire phase it's magically her birthday. Which would be September 13th, so apparently all this takes place with in a month?   Which would mean she would have to be pregnant for only a week or 2?    The other things I didn't like was that Jacob (who was one of my fave characters, besides Alice) does a complete about face. First he hates vampires, their smells and is completely in love with Bella. All of a sudden he's in love with a half vampire newborn? I also didn't like the fact where SM tried to explain how Renesme and Jacob were alike with 24 pairs of chromosomes..who cares? it's still sick! And of all the names she could have chosen...renesme, i mean need i say more? Renesme's appearance was what ruined the book for me. First, how could she even happen? IF Edward has no heartbeat/blood it's not physically possible. Also, wouldn't his venom kill Bella the first time they made love? And the birth scene was traumatic. I didn't understand how in Twilight everyone could be around Bella after James attacks her and not care to New Moon where she gets a papercut and all of a sudden they want to eat her to Breaking Dawn where she's throwing up blood while giving bith and have Alice and Jasper in the next room and not care? Aren't these the same characters tried to kill her and that had to leave the house in NM? Also, how can a girl go from passing out at the smell of blood (in Twilight) to drinking blood in BD? I always knew she would have to drink blood when she became a vamp but BEFORE? That also made no sense to me.     AND then Edward (who is so hopelessly in love with Bella he would rather die than live without her) suggests she has kids with Jacob! AND Jacob considers! I found that disturbing because he's only 16. How many 16 year olds want to have kids? Honestly, how hard would it have been for him to imprint on Leah? At least that would have made a little sense!    The other problem with the book is NO one has to sacrifice ANYTHING. I'm not saying I would want any characters to die (although i think SM could have killed off a couple of the secondary charaters in the fight scene that didn't happen). Bella gets everything: the husband, the kid, the family, the house, endless amounts of money, the beauty, grace and the boy she couldn't bear to let go of. And am i the only one that felt like strangling Bella? She's so whiny, selfish and a sex addict...I couldn't stand her. I really took a disliking to her in Eclipse and now her character is very annoying. Does Bella go anywhere if she doesn't have to be dragged? Can't she ever say thank you for anything the Cullen family does for her instead of complaining about it and going to her \\"happy place\\"? At least now she's a vampire and Edward can't hold her down anymore...by dismantling her truck, having Alice keep tabs on her and covering her mouth when she wants to speak.     I wish I had a quarter for everytime someone: shudders, growls, hisses, looked at with chagrin and for everytime Bella said Edward was: inhumanly beautiful, gorgeous, carved from stone, etc...I mean we get it! He's good looking...We Know!     The one part of the book I wish I could have read was the part where Leah tells Bella off for using Jacob. That could have made for good reading! But sadly, even that is left. But we do get to read a bunch of meaningless back stories of characters i could care less about. I believe that was 200 pages.I also had hoped to read more about Alice. She was one of my favorite characters and she barely utters 10 sentences in the over 700 pages of book. And also where is Renee? I know if i was a mother I would be concerned if my daughter was on her deathbed. I don't think she even calls her daughter during the whole book. And Charlie, he goes from being an over protetive father to a \\"who cares?\\" character. This was just lazy writing by a brilliant writer. By keeping Renee out and having Edward, Charlie and Jacob (just to mention a few)completely change she could avoid the hard issues of Bella becoming a vampire and having a child that grows at the speed of light. I hope this is the last of the Twilight series, unless she retracts BD and starts out with something new...This could have been a GREAT book instead of fan fiction.
0765342294|2.0|Ender's Game is a good idea that was botched by providing an artificial, easy solution to every moral dilemma.    From the beginning of the book you're supposed to feel nothing but sympathy for Ender.  He's the poster boy for a military eugenics program, brilliant, yet kind and gentle.  Through the entire book he has to overcome obstacle after obstacle, but each obstacle is presented in such a way that Ender acts perfectly.  Ender's always brilliant and he always cares about other people.  Yawn.  The book misses every opportunity it creates for looking at ethical dilemmas, yet it presents so many that would be ripe for discussion.  Population controls?  Eugenics?  Education?  Militarization of society?  Manipulation of children?  These are just some of the moral dilemmas that Ender's Game just glosses over.    The book does have a solid fan base.  The reason it has so many fans is because boys want to be Ender Wiggin, which isn't a bad reason to like books in general, it's just that Ender is such a terrible role model.  Ender gets to beat up (and even murder) his enemies, such as school bullies, while being the smartest kid, and he never takes real responsibility for his actions.  It's the dream of every bright kid everywhere, but neither reality nor better novels are like that.  Ender's Game presents a magical, unbelievable world where the solution to everything is just to be smart enough and strong enough to beat up everybody who's a bad person, and if you do something really bad (not like Unabomber bad, more like Hitler bad) then it's not your fault.    The rest of the series reads like an apology for Ender's Game, but falls into the same trap of resetting every moral dilemma with some magic button that you can only figure out if you're smart enough, and Ender's the only one in the galaxy smart enough to press it, apparently.  The messages of the series?  You just have to be smart enough, and if you care you'll never have ethical problems because you can always find a perfect solution, and eugenics works, and people should have large families.  If you're looking for a good hero for young boys who like Sci-Fi, then keep looking because there ain't one here.    Throw a dart at a list of Hugo winners.  You will find far more sophisticated fare and better ethical dilemmas wherever the dart lands (as long as it doesn't land here).  Ethical dilemmas are a hallmark of good science fiction, magic answers to all your problems are not.    All said, the book isn't badly written.  Like most popular sci-fi produced in the past few decades, it is paced well, the story is tight without extraneous fluff, it stays true to its core (however demented), and the prose flows well.  Card obviously knows how to put together a paragraph or two he just doesn't know jack about ethics.

B00006HAZG|5.0|There are many reasons to watch this excellent film: it contains mystery, melodrama, romance, scrumptious costumes, and a splendid cast of the finest actors, including Bob Hoskins, as the debt-ridden Mr. Macawber--always waiting optimistically for something to \\"turn up\\"; and his wife, \\"faithful to the end,\\" played with to the hilt by Imelda Staunton; and, of course, the young Daniel Radcliffe in his pre-Harry Potter days, who portrays the title role with the ease of a natural actor; he is totally believable.<br /><br />Of the many reasons to purchase this excellent DVD, however, the most compelling is the privilege of watching Dame Maggie Smith reveling in the role of Aunt Betsy. Whether she is banishing donkeys from her green sward or falling backwards into her herbaceous border upon being accosted by her unknown ragamuffin nephew, Dame Maggie is magnificent to behold. The highlight for me was her sending the ghastly Murdstones packing with a flea in their ears; a feat she reprises after the unmasking of the opprobrious Uriah Heap. Smith is so perfect one would think that Dickens had created the role especially for her.<br /><br />My only criticism concerns the dashing Steerforth, whose character, undoubtedly because of considerations of length, was given short shrift. The film did not develop the friendship that grows between David and Steerforth in school, which explains the utter trust in which David holds his friend when they grow up, and also exposes the utter betrayal of that friendship.<br /><br />With its theme of embezzlement, the film proves to be especially timely in respect to today's money catastrophe; one wishes that its solution to the crisis--transportation for life--was still available for the financial miscreants; but then I suppose that Australia would refuse to take them!<br /><br />\\"David Copperfield\\" is riveting from beginning to end; and the end is guaranteed to engender mixed feelings--happiness that it ends on such an upbeat, and sorrow that it has to end at all. One almost longs for a spinoff sequel that follows the fate of the Macawbers in Australia.<br /><br />At any rate, purchase \\"David Copperfield\\"; it's a keeper. And then you too will delight in the donkeys and in Dame Maggie Smith!almost longs for a spinoff sequel that follows the fate of the Macawbers in Australia.

0930289234|5.0|I purchased this item when the theater release of Watchmen was getting close, and I am SOO glad I did.  After seeing the movie, which I loved, I could imagine seeing it without reading the book first.  The book itself is a masterpeice by all forms of the definition.  A person who is not into comic books or super heroes in general can easily enjoy this thoroughly, and I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't.  Though it's not for young children, it is great for adults of all ages.  If you haven't read this book, you should.  Plain and simple.
B000TU16GS|5.0|Move over James Bond. Alex Rider is the new spy of the generation, and the surprising thing is that he is only 14. He may seem like a normal London schoolboy, but he sure isn't. He is both intelligent and physically fit, making for a very powerful combination of brains AND brawn. He has even been learning karate since a very young age, and he has acquired a black belt. His karate skills come in handy when he is thrust into the life of a spy.       For Alex, it all started the morning that his uncle died. Suddenly, his life is turned upside down. Soon, he finds himself in the hands of the Royal&General bank, which was where his uncle worked. Or so he thought. He soon confirms that his uncle was a spy. Eventually, his curiousity leads to his life as a spy. After just two weeks of training, he is sent on the mission that his uncle died on. He is forced to follow a dead man's trail, and he is constantly in danger of dying. Will he survive? Read on to find out.      Stormbreaker is a must read for anyone interested in action. Each page brings you deeper into the life of Alex Rider, and you will enjoy the book so much that you won't want to put it down. Fortunately, there are several sequels for you to enjoy. I would recommend this book to both teenagers and adults. This book is not limited to a certain age range, and I am sure that everyone will grow to love Alex Rider.

0765356139|1.0|I'll be vague as to avoid spoilers from either of the books. I read and loved the first book in this trilogy. The second book, The Well of Ascension just destroyed my love for the series. I would recommend the first book in a heartbeat (it's a pretty self contained novel, it has a pretty solid conclusion), and I would recommend not reading the following books.     The cast of characters in the second book are far less likable than the first. The main characters in the novel I personally found to be annoying and lacking any kind of charm. The action from the first book is gone. The action that IS in this novel feels like it was placed there at an editors request. The conversation probably went something like...    Editor: \\"Brandon, I noticed that nothing happened whatsoever for the last 400 pages, maybe you should stick in some pointless action scenes to liven things up a little bit.\\"  Brandon: \\"Well, I feel like some action would damage the depressing, slow, monotonous tone I'm trying to achieve with The Well of Ascension. Maybe we can compromise for something actually happening every 300 pages?\\"    I read 440 pages of this book before I had stop from the lack of progress being made story wise. Read page 1 than flip to page 440 and basically nothing of note has happened. Much, and I mean MUCH of this book could have been stripped out. I'm sorry but I do NOT need a chapter about Vin going to buy a bloody dress. The biggest problem with this book is that it changed from a DOING book; action and kicking butt stuff... to a talking book. Holy crap, everyone in it had something to say and half of the time it was of no interest whatsoever. So much time is spent yacking and so much of the yacking is done by boring, uninspired characters.    Elend: \\"I don't know what to do, I feel so sorry for myself, I'm a moron\\"  Vin: \\"I dont know who I am. I am so disturbed. I wish I was a better mistborn. The mist makes me feel so special inside, I wish Elends touch was as nice as this misty goodness. No one understand me!\\"    Yack Yack bloody yack. You get this stuff for atleast 440 pages (probably the whole book). Holy... it's like CSPAN in novel form.

031237593X|5.0|To be brief, this is by far, without a doubt, the best book ever written in the historical fiction genre.  Penman writes so beautifully about a man so misunderstood (Richard III).  After reading this book, you will not be so quick to judge him as history has.  Bravo to the author.  I will read every book she's written and wait for more!!!!!!!!

1401322336|1.0|My wife bought this book for its appealing pictures. However, since then we have tried a couple of dishes and all of them were an utter disappointment. Dishes are quite labor intensive and do not come out well. Jamie tends to add \\"twists\\" to the recipes that may sound like European sophistication to the uninitiated reader but that in reality are just plainly inappropriate. Who in his/her right mind would ever drawn mashed potatoes in olive oil, overload pasta sauce with crème fraîche, or add orange zest to a meat marinade? But then, who in his/her right mind would ever think of an English chef as an authority in matters of fine dining?

B000024JEX|5.0|With 422 minutes of music that spans three nights and six complete performances, this is arguably the most impressive look into the \\"Standards Trio\\" that is available in one (boxed) set.<br /><br />The concerts took place on June 3-5, 1994, and provides the listener with an incredible appreciation with the way Keith Jarrett (p), Jack DeJohnette (d) and Gary Peacock (b) would vary sound, vision and structure over a short period of time within the same venue. The physical structure does not change, but the variables for each artist does, which is brilliantly captured in the collection.<br /><br />And it is when the trio stretches out on a nearly 27 minute version of Autumn Leaves and 29 minute rendition of Desert Sun that the full potential of performing before an audience is heard; the energy between the fans and musicians is incredible.<br /><br />There were many vibrant colors on the vast canvas for these shows at the Blue Note, which only grow more vivid with each listen.

0132350882|5.0|This is primarily a book about code style. That sounds dull, but it doesn't have to be. Rather than just saying \\"do this,\\" this book provides rational arguments to support patterns that make code much, much easier to read, remember and refactor. It's easier to write, too--unlike other style guides which say to comment everything (even getters and setters!), Clean Code advises you to use comments sparingly; usually, the code should speak for itself. The book concludes with actual case studies from large, open-source projects where messy code is cleaned up. This is an extremely useful exercise.<br /><br />If you're a solo programmer, I'd recommend perusing this book. And if you're on a team, give this book to everyone else on it. You might just end up with some better programmers.
B000WC39SG|2.0|Great movie, but I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this Blu-ray version.  So my rating is not for the movie itself which I would give between 4 and 5 stars.  I give it two stars on the technical quality. The video quality was no better than the standard DVD, which I already own, and the audio might even be worse than the standard DVD.  All in All a very poor transfer to Blu-ray, do not waste your money on this version.
0735619670|5.0|This book's discussion of programming philosophy and code style is essential reading. It's used as a textbook in some undergraduate software architecture courses, but it's also friendly enough for independent study. This book made me rethink the way I'd been coding for years.<br /><br />I'd also recommend the more recent [[ASIN:0132350882 Clean Code]], especially for Java programmers, as it goes into more depth, even providing actual case studies in which code is dramatically cleaned up.
B00005NP20|5.0|This is by far the best version I have seen. It does true justice to the intricacies of Hugo's story.

B0017V7GTY|4.0|The guys of The Gaslight Anthem have accomplished something with their release \\"The '59 Sound\\" something that many roots rock groups have tried to accomplish for a decade.  They have combined the roots sound of over-driven vocals and guitar amps, with straight-forward pop-punk riffs in a record that is radio ready.  They are a younger, mainstream-friendly version of Lucero or the Replacements.  This LP showcases a sound that a growing sect of indie-music lovers crave and cannot get enough.
0071359168|1.0|My mistake. Why I bought a marketing and positioning book written in the 70's and believed it would apply to today's world, for me as the owner of a small business, is hard for me to remember.  The lessons described in this book simply either:  a) Do not apply to most businesses today  b) Would never apply to most medium size and no small businesses  c) Do not include reference to any current marketing tools such as websites, social networking, twitter, blogs, etc.  Again, it was my mistake for buying this book and not the author's in trying to make some additional income from old material.
0451209338|4.0|A thriller that's sure to hold your interest with crisp action, exotic locales, and an absorbing plot. I find this genre to be filled with silly books that make me wince, but this one is better than most. It's not up to the literate level of LeCarre or Furst, but it's also less demanding than books from those authors. I found the subject of the Israeli intelligence service to be intriguing and this book does provide some interesting backstory to middle east politics. While the heroes are on the Israeli side, there are a couple of insights which are sympathetic to the Palestinian plight. In this genre there's always a delicate balance to be achieved between surprising the reader, maintaining a plausible story, and keeping the characters intelligent. So often, one of those legs of the tripod fails. To Silva's credit though, he does quite a good job here of maintaining that balance. So, if you're looking for a light read that is reasonably intelligent and has the requisite action and locales of the spy genre, I recommend The Kill Artist.
B000VWE5OY|2.0|I am a huge Doctor Who fan for over 30 years and just started watching the first few episodes of Torchwood. I was warned about its edge and sexuality, so was not surprised at some of the content. Overall the series could be a lot better. I agree with most reviewers about the homosexual and athiest overtones. I don't have a problem with gay characters or references, but in Torchwood's first few episodes all the gay and bi-sexual content does nothing to advance the plot. The atheism in the first episode also serves no purpose. I have heard that Russel T. Davis is gay and watching this almost feels like him saying \\"I am gay and an athiest and am going to work that in wherever I can.\\" Mr. Davis did a wonderful job of reviving Doctor Who, but I think Torchwood should have undergone a few more rewrites. The show is entertaining, but would be a lot better if I didn't feel like I was constantly being slapped in the face with Russel T's personal messages. If you are a big Dr. Who fan I would not automatically recommend this. Check it out before you buy it.
B00005JNQS|2.0|This movie is visually beautiful and it's obvious that the designers and modelers and programmers did a lot of great work and the voice actors were rather good too.  I was impressed by the first few minutes, but when Fender and Copperbottom got to the big city and the movie had many minutes to waste on them being bounced around the town like pinballs I realized that there likely wasn't much of a story to advance, so they had to waste a lot of time doing gags.  When a flatulance joke goes on and on and on, you know you're in trouble.<br /><br />And that's what took this movie from a potential classic to an also-ran in the world of 3d animated films.  All those tin men, and no heart.  Maybe they should have gone to Oz first and loaded up.<br /><br />So, the look is top notch, but the story could have been significantly upgraded.  You can shine no matter what you're made of, and you can also be dull no matter how you're animated.  I wonder what Walt Disney could have done with the technology we have today.<br /><br />Postscript: The DVD product has a wealth of special features for a single disk.  I would add another star for that if I could.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|Although I loved the animated Speed Racer, I didn't have high expectations for this movie because of the trailer. After watching it, I realized that no trailer can do this movie justice. A few disconnected seconds just can't give you the idea of how exciting, fun (and funny), warm-hearted, and touching this movie is. I rarely watch a movie more than once, and I ended up watching this one three times in the first week, getting more out of it each time.<br /><br />The story builds beautifully and is far more than bright colors and flashy (and great) CG. It is a story of honor and honesty pitted against the evil that men can become when they have too much wealth and power.<br /><br />It is also laugh-out-loud funny. When John Goodman says, \\"Ninja? More like a nonja. Terrible what passes for a ninja these days,\\" everyone in the room laughed out loud--and not for the first or last time. It wasn't just *what* he was saying; it was how he said it and the implication that he had fought ninjas before.<br /><br />The overbright colors and fantasy cars and driving take a little getting used to, but they completely fit the story, and there are some gorgeous scenes that could not have been done without this style. (Such as the woman who starts the Casa Christo race--the way she walked, her outfit, her superb self-possession--with an improbably long scarf flaring dramatically out in front of a brilliant sunrise.)<br /><br />Of course, on Blu-Ray, the resolution is beautiful. And if you are the type who watches extras (I am), you'll find a lot to keep you busy.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This movie is absolutly hilarious. Its well worth watching and more than worth the $10 it costs to buy the DVD. I wont bother with a plot synopsis or description as thats been done many....many times already, but I did want to address one thing I have read more than once.<br /><br />There are several negative reviews related to the format of the DVD saying it was done on cheap material and not worth buying. I have to say that I honestly cant tell the difference between this DVD and any other DVD I own. A difference may be there but I cant find it, and it doesnt effect the picture quality at all. The DvD has artwork on its back and the case appears professionaly done.<br /><br />Dont let people confuse you, there is nothing wrong with this product.
B00005JLWN|5.0|A bunch of my buddies recommended this movie to me and after watching it I found myself wondering why I hadn't heard of it or seen it in theaters. This \\"B movie\\" has great production value and surprisingly superb acting. With better marketing and a bigger release, this film could have made big bucks in the US and would have attracted the same audience that made the Matrix as successful as it was. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the movie the Matrix or enjoyed reading Fahrenheit 451 or 1984.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|SPOILER ALERT    After the successful and critically acclaimed Casino Royale, the film makers of the James Bond series were in a difficult position.  How to make the next OO7 epic better than the last?  Well I can tell you from the opening car chase to the fiery inferno ending, Quantum of Solace is Bond at his best.    Daniel Craig reprises his version of super spy James Bond with even greater depth than he did in \\"Royale\\".  He literally makes the audience watch his every move because you never know what he is thinking or doing next.  From flipping cell phones and hotel keys into the corners of scenery, to his panache for acquiring motor vehicles, Craig keeps you guessing.  His Bond continues to evolve with every scene, from the fast cutting conflicts with assassins to his cold, callous way of disposing a corpse.  This Bond is not to be messed with.     Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson, the producers, deserve high praises for taking the series into a more artistic direction.  Where director Martin Campbell painted his canvas in \\"Casino Royale\\"; leaving a bare section that is uniquely painted in by Marc Forster, the director of \\"Quantum\\".  Both have different styles and pacing, with some nice juxtaposition touches by Forster with scenes at a horse race and an Opera, but like a Monet painting you really cannot see the entire picture unless you step back and take it all in.  After the unveiling, one can see the arc that Bond's character takes in \\"Royale\\" and completes at the end of \\"Quantum\\".  His relationship with Vesper, the girl in Casino Royale, and why she betrayed him comes full circle and how he turns his chaotic world into a controlled force that makes him the cool agent under fire we all love.     Quantum begins with a beautiful aerial shot of mountains off the coast of Lake Garda in Italy, the scene quickly changes to Bond driving the Aston Martin DBS while being chased and attacked by unknown assassins in Alfa Romero cars.  The editing is so brisk one canbe forgiven for wondering if they are watching a Jason Bourne film.  But that is where the similarity ends.  The quick cutting is supposed to be chaotic and dizzy because it represents the current and confused world of James Bond.  The countless kills he has done in the last few months and his mental attitude as to how he fits in this corrupt world.  Who does he trust, who deserves to die?  The body count continues to rise throughout the film until Bond changes from a destructive force into an agent who controls his aggressive behavior.  In fact, he comes very close to shooting the Bond girl and himself when he realizes there is no other option.  Fortunately for him, and the audience, he sees an escape and saves the day.  A very unique scene in the 46 year old series.     Judi Dench gives yet another superb performance as Bond's chief \\"M\\" and she alone contributes the key quote that sums up \\"Quantum\\", \\"When you can't tell your friends from your enemies, it's time to go.\\"  That line will echo throughout this film, for many who claim to be on Bond's good side will indeed show their true deceptive colors.     The biggest surprise in this film is Olga Kurylenko, who plays Camille.  A woman novelist Ian Fleming would have written, \\"A bird with a wing down\\".  Her back story is tragic and her motivation mirrors Bond's in the revenge department.  Olga, who is originally from the Ukraine, is terrific in this role and it is hard to believe that she is not Hispanic.  She is completely believable and perhaps one of the best Bond girls in recent memory.     Gemma Arterton is the other female interest and is also excellent in her role as Agent `Strawberry' Fields.  She falls for Bond's seductive charm and ends up in an iconic position that is both sexy and eerie.     Jeffrey Wright returns in the role of Felix Leiter, the second actor to play the part in two Bond films and the first time consecutively.  His presence is always welcomed and both he and Craig seem to be enjoying their scenes together.     Giancarlo Giannini also returns as Rene Mathis, the MI-6 agent who was last tassered in \\"Royale\\".  He is the father-figure to Bond and the healing link between his violent world and civilization.  A vital character in Fleming's novels Casino Royale and From Russia with Love, and most recently Sebastian Faulks' Devil May Care.  He is the pivotal key to Bond's sanity.     Other members of the cast include Jesper Christensen as the elusive Mr. White.  David Harbour as arrogant CIA agent Gregg Beam, Anatole Taubman as bad hair day Elvis, and Joaquin Cosio as power hungry General Medrano.  Every major character in the film is well developed.  My only complaint is with the henchman `Elvis'.   Somehow he got lost in translation.  I was never too sure what he was doing there and even his demise is over too quickly.  He is certainly an interesting henchman, but so under developed that he simply comes across as table dressing.     Lastly, kudos goes to the villain Dominic Greene, played exceptionally well by Mathieu Amalric.  His first appearance looks benevolent but he is as deadly as they come.  His character is more like Vladek Sheybal's Kronsteen in \\"From Russia With Love\\".  A planner and a schemer who allows his men to do the dirty work but is not reserved to fighting dirty himself if necessary.  He is the front man to Quantum's latest conquest, the possession of 60% of Bolivia's water supply and the control of its new President Medrano.  It may not be the hijacking of NATO atomic bombs as seen in Thunderball or the radiating of the US gold supply in Goldfinger, but when water is a scarce commodity in a desert region, owning it can lead to billions of revenue.     \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is the shortest of all the Bond films clocking in at nearly 105 minutes.  It may be short in length but it is filled with superb film making that deflates the current competition of super spies with the initials of JB.     Rated PG-13 for violence, language and subtle nudity.
B000QUUD60|5.0|If you are a Elvis fan, this is a must have.  It is truely excellent!
B0000019HU|5.0|The ability to forge powerful and emotionally evocative music with as little instrumentation and texture as possible. To create something starkly minimal and elegant that is also overwhelming and encapsulating. This is what Slint managed so well with \\"Spiderland\\". They stripped traditional rock formats to extreme basics, creating one of the most important contemporary albums.<br /><br />\\"Spiderland\\" is often labelled as one of the very first post-rock albums. There is certainly the stark dynamic shifts akin to the genre, with songs often starting out as single guitar motifs and ending as full-on assaults. The vocals drift between soft whispers, spoken word and frustrated croons. However, \\"Spiderland\\" is much more than today's often generic post-rock sound. The guitars are gritty and far more visceral than anything Mogwai or GY!BE would ever belt out, and often progress into full-on riffs. It's atmospheric, but in an intensely sombre way that goes beyond much of the disposable noodling found in modern post-rock. Perhaps then it is just what post-rock should be. It should be beautiful music that can be at once fragile and on the brink of falling apart, and switch to absolute bombastic power.<br /><br />There really isn't a weak track, and the songs tend to follow similar patterns and structuring - and so I don't feel it necessary to pick apart every song as some fans have done. To be concise, \\"Spiderland\\" is the perfect deconstruction of rock - it manages to be abrasive and confrontational, yet unadorned and delicate.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|A heartwarming, moving and beautifully animated Walt Disney film get its special DVD treatment in a brand new 2-Disc Big Wave Edition.<br /><br />In 2002, Walt Disney's 42nd animated feature from the Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida studio would become a commercial success with over $35 million in its first weekend and eventually would make over $273 million worldwide.

These two characters are so unlike any Disney characters with Lilo who comes from literally a broken home, her older sister Nani trying to make ends meet as the guardian of Lilo after the death of their parents and just to watch how theirlife has been personally affected.  Stitch is unlike any Disney character that we have seen.  He is quite mischievous and eats his snot, how crazy is that?<br /><br />The character of Lilo is full of vitality but because her parents are deceased and having to stay at home while her sister works and the family not exactly having a lot of money, she wants to fit in with the other girls but it just doesn't happen that easily.<br /><br />And the relationship between Lilo & Stitch was just enjoyable to watch.  Stitch brings joy into her life despite being a bit troublesome, but Lilo is somewhat similar and thus starts to grow up now that she has the responsibility of taking care of her pet.  As for Stitch, being raised to be this weapon of destruction, he learns from Lilo that being part of a family is very important and like the story of \\"Ugly Duckling\\", Lilo embraces him with open arms and he learns how relationships mean to him.  Love rather than destruction.<br /><br />Combined with a beautiful, colorful and lush setting of Hawaii, the art and animation department did a great job capturing Hawaii all the way up to the movements of the hulu dancing.  Overall, this film was just fun to watch and it's also great to watch this film again and watching a Disney animated film that were hand drawn using CGI but a film not entirely 3D which many of the animated Disney films are of late.<br /><br />When \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" was released into theaters, I have to admit that I was very happy because America would get a second animated film from Disney that would feature a lead and supporting character that is Asian.  \\"Mulan\\" was fun but it was a period film taking place during the Chinese Dynasty, \\"Lilo & Stich\\" on the other hand, this is an entirely different animated film with it's own style thanks to the characters and the overall setting.  This is just an enjoyably fun and entertaining film.<br /><br />The documentary included on disc 2 was just amazing to watch because you literally see how directors/writers Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois really gave their all for this film.  It's rare to catch these lengthy documentaries in a Walt Disney DVD release and I don't think I have ever watched a documentary over 2 hours long in a DVD or Blu-ray release for an animated film.  But nevertheless, really good insight on the creative process and those who want to get involved in the animated film industry will definitely enjoy this documentary and what they can learn from it.<br /><br />As for the release of the \\"2-Disc Big Wave Edition\\", it's literally the cherry on top of the cake.  I was just amazed by the sheer amount of special features included.  Disc 1 is pretty much packed with bonus features but to know there was more footage ala the documentary and deleted scenes on disc 2, I was impressed.  Disney definitely went all out for this release.<br /><br />It's quite interesting how this 2-Disc DVD release was announced back in 2003 but finally made its way to DVD seven years later and with that being said, this is one of those films that you can only hope that Disney releases on Blu-ray because if this animated film looks and sounds good on DVD, I can imagine how awesome it would look in high definition.<br /><br />All in all, there really is nothing negative I can say about this \\"Lilo & Stitch: 2-Disc Big Wave Edition\\" release.  It's an awesome film in which Disney went all out in making sure fans get the ultimate DVD release and this release doesn't disappoint at all.  The only thing that can be better is a high definition release but for now, this DVD release definitely gets an A+.<br /><br />\\"Lilo & Stitch: 2-Disc Big Wave Edition\\" is highly recommended!tch\\", recording audio, animating, changing scenes because of what transpired in 9/11, marketing including the \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" toys, the McDonalds Happy Meals toys and more.      * Documentary Footnotes: Aside from the documentary and deleted/early version scenes, the documentary footnotes includes more bonus footage such as scene that Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois worked on for \\"Mulan\\" titled \\"Mulan's Decision\\", Walking is Falling: Joe Grant in Conversation with Dean DeBlois, Chris' Pitch Book, Chris' Photo Gallery, Treatise on Stich, Andreas Deja's sketches of Lilo, Fishing with Ric, Ric Slutter Interviews Maurice Noble, Dumbo: The Train Arrives, Chalk Talk: Alex Kupershmidt on Stitch, Chalk Talk: Andreas Deja on Lilo, The Sanders Style book and the Disney \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" trailers.      * Deleted Scenes and Early Version Scenes - There were considerable amount of changes during \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" from its original treatment to the final cut.

B000056HE9|5.0|Love the movie and the DVD was everything it said it would be. Good price too.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|For all reviewers who bashed this movie, I say you just didn't \\"get it\\".  Sure, it's a fantasy so you have to take that as intended.  But there are some real messages here.  It should get you to thinking about how we look (and deal with) acceptance of one another, relationships, death, our parents, love and the many people we meet in life who help shape who we are.  Too many movies nowadays are over the top in action.  This is a quiet movie - so sit back, open your mind to the underlying tone and enjoy - it's one of the better movies out there!
B000A2RRF4|4.0|Great concert.  Outstanding dancing.  Sound could've been a little better if Michael sang directly into the headset.  Would've preferred less lip synching and more live singing.  Overall if you're a Michael Jackson fan, you'll enjoy the DVD.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|It was a great concept and story to begin with. Otherwise, the two sequels wouldn't of made it to the big screen.     Just sit back and enjoy the the Lycans(werewolves) shoot UV encased bullets into vampires and vampires shooting Silver Nitrate encased bullets into Lycans, and both sides obliterate each other none stop.
0451217403|5.0|I've seen the film The Godfather countless times but until recently never read the book. I picked it up on a whim and found it thoroughly engrossing. It was great to get so much more depth to the characters. It's very well written too and there's never a dull moment. Worthwhile for anyone whether they've seen the film or not.
B001PKHS68|5.0|Beautiful, well-casted and a classic romantic, suspenseful thriller from Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"TO CATCH A THIEF\\" looks great for a 1955 film on DVD.  One thing that Hitchcock really utilized on this film is color.  From the beauty of France, set design, costume design.  Everything was well done and vibrant.  The film looks beautiful and is featured in Widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TV's.<br /><br />As for the audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital English 2.0 Surround/English, French and Spanish Mono.<br /><br />As for subtitles, subtitles are in English, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />There are a good number of special features on the Centennial Collection of \\"TO CATCH A THIEF\\" with a few new featurettes plus the previous features included in the 2007 DVD release.  The majority of the special features are included on the second disc (commentary on the first disc).  Included are:<br /><br />  * Commentary: - The Centennial Collection forgoes the original commentary featured on the 2007 DVD  by Peter Bogdanovich and Laurent Bouzereau and now features commentary by Dr. Drew Casper, Hitchcock Prof. of American Film at USC who definitely knows his Hitchcock (even Hitchcock's family are surprised with his knowledge for the \\"A Night With the Hitchcock\\" events).  Casper is passionate about the filming and his commentary is just informative and well-done.<br />  * A Night with the Hitchcock's - A new 23-minute featurette filmed on Nov. 2008 at the University of Southern California (USC).  The Hitchcock class is one of the most popular classes at the university and the family has come to these events for several years answering questions from students in regards to Alfred Hitchcock as a director and also insight of his family life.  Pat Hitchcock (daughter of Alfred Hitchcock), Mary Stone (granddaughter of Alfred Hitchcock) and moderated by Dr. Drew Casper, Hitchcock Prof. of American Film at USC.  Very informative and enjoyable to learn about the family life of Alfred Hitchcock.<br />  * Unacceptable Under the Code: Film Censorship in America - A new near 12-minute featurette about the strict restrictions imposed on the film industry, this film shows how Alfred Hitchcock would find ways to work around the censorship code.<br />  * Writing and Casting To Catch a Thief - A nine minute featurette about the film, the screenplay and casting Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.  Original featurette from the 2007 DVD release.<br />  * The Making of To Catch a Thief - A near 17-minute featurette about the making of the film, shooting in the US at the Paramount lot and shooting in France. Interview with Hitchcock's daughter Mary Stone who gives insight of the film, especially the challenges of filming the kissing and beach scenes which the censorship code wanted eliminated from the film but how Hitchcock created the film to ensure that the scenes stayed in the film. Interviews with production manager Dock Erickson who provides technical insight and using VistaVision.  Interviews with Steven DeRosa, author of \\"Writing with Hitchcock\\" who shared his knowledge about Hitchcock and interviews with Pat Hitchcock in regards to Edith Head's fashion designs for the film and much more.  An original feature used on the 2007 release.<br />  * Behind the Gates: Cary Grant and Grace Kelly - A new six minute featurette about the film featuring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly and how these two had instant chemistry together on screen.<br />  * Alfred Hitchcock and To Catch a Thief: An Appreciation - This seven minute featurette is about the humor of Alfred Hitchcock and how Grace Kelly and Hitchcock were good friends.  Mary Stone (Hitchcock's granddaughter) discussing her personal experiences with her grandfather including working with him on a college paper about a film they both enjoyed and getting a C and more.  Originally featured in the 2007 DVD release of \\"TO CATCH A THIEF\\".<br />  * Edith Head: The Paramount Years - A 13-minute featurette featuring Edith Head known for her costumes for \\"Columbia Pictures\\" and the many memorable films that she took part in.<br />  * Trailers: - Original Theatrical Trailer (2:11)<br />  * If You Love To Catch Thief, You'll Love this Interactive Travelogue - A segment that allows people to see a map of the French Riviera.  When you click on one of the nine cities featured on the map, you get to see parts of the film while a narrator talks about the city and its surroundings.<br />  * Galleries - A section to see image galleries for the movie, publicity, visitors to the set and production.<br /><br />And like previous Centennial Collections from Paramount, a booklet is included with information and tidbits about the film and its stars and also a cardboard slipcase that holds the DVD/case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />There are plenty of Hitchcock films that I would love to see receive a \\"Centennial Collection\\" treatment but it'll probably never happen since \\"TO CATCH A THIEF\\" is the only Hitchcock film that Paramount still owns (note: the company sold all rights back to Hitchcock in the 1960's which now, the majority of his films are distributed by Universal).  But if anything, with this being the sole Hitchcock film owned by Paramount, they really did give an awesome \\"Centennial Collection\\" tribute to Alfred Hitchcock with the number of special features included on this DVD.  The new features are just great, especially the interviews with his daughter Pat and granddaughter Mary who give us this personal side of Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />\\"TO CATCH A THIEF\\" is one of those films that showcase a side of Alfred Hitchcock that doesn't go dark or hardcore into the suspense.  In fact, the film is quite beautiful with the amount of cinema work done in France and thus you really get beautiful cinematography during the outdoor scenes.<br /><br />The chemistry between Cary Grant and Grace Kelly was just well done.  Knowing that before Grant took the part, he was set on retirement and felt his career was pretty much done but it was that keen eye of Alfred Hitchcock that wanted these two together and he did what he could to get him to accept the role of John Robie.  Grace Kelly, a favorite actress that Hitchcock would have in several of his film (and this film would be her last for him before comitting to her duties as Princess of Monaco) was just absolutely dashing and charming.  Both talents just clicked.<br /><br />Of course, part of the beauty of the film is that it utilized the Technicolor technology, VistaVision for its widescreen shots (Hitchcock's first utilization of the technology in his films) and utilized stereophonic for audio.  The film won an Academy Award for \\"Best Cinematography\\" and the film is quite deserving.  In fact, watching it again, I'm just amazed at the beautiful shots in the film.  Well done!<br /><br />For those who purchased the 2007 DVD, many may wonder if the \\"Centennial Collection\\" is worth it?  I own the 2007 version but it all depends on the viewer.  If the three extra special features and the new commentary are worth it.  Personally, I found the added footage and commentary to be well worth it.  Dr. Drew Casper's knowledge of Hitchcock is just incredible and his commentary is absolutely well-done and again, \\"A Night With the Hitchcock's\\" was just a pleasure to watch.  So, yes...this Centennial Collection version is worth it!<br /><br />Overall, this \\"Centennial Collection\\" for \\"TO CATCH A THIEF\\" is another solid DVD release for Paramount's collection.  Personally, I would love to see these Centennial Collections in Blu-ray but for now, this DVD is just the definitive version to own.<br /><br />Although, not my favorite Hitchcock film, as I'm more into his more suspenseful and psychological thrillers,  I've always enjoyed \\"TO CATCH A THIEF\\" for it's overall presentation and the talent involved onscreen but watching this DVD and its special features, it gave memore of an appreciation towards this film.<br /><br />This film is, to me, is Hitchcock's most passionate and strikingly beautiful looking films that he has ever done so far.<br /><br />The film is elegant, beautiful and memorable and the many special features included really does give tribute to one of the world's most prolific director's ever.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock fans, \\"TO CATCH A THIEF - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" is highly recommended!e of Alfred Hitchcock that wanted these two together and he did what he could to get him to accept the role of John Robie.

Alfred Hitchcock fans, \\"TO CATCH A THIEF - CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" is highly recommended!

0684857219|5.0|This was quickly delivered and in mint condition. It has been very useful so far and I've only read a very small part of it! I'm not personally trying to become a Mr. Universe or end up anywhere near that size, I'm after more of a Tyler Durden from Fight Club look but this book will help you with every aspect. It'll help you determine your body type, the style of training to suit, exercise after exercise, how you should be eating.....the list goes on. If you're into training to any degree really then I think this book will be able to offer you no end of guidance and information. A worthy purchase as far as I'm concerned!

B001JSTKNA|5.0|This young Lady GaGa brings an intelligence and savvy to her debut disc The Fame. The cd is breaks new ground in fun catchy danceable music. This record is wonderfully schizophrenic in sound one moment it sounds clubby/new wave/kitsch/superpop/hiphop and she makes it all sound like one sound. This young lady has the potential to be the next Madonna and I do not say that lightly as I have been a huge Madonna fan for 25 years. Go Lady GaGa Go!!!
B001PPLIFU|5.0|Non-stop action, Daniel Craig continues to shine in his roles as James Bond and for the Blu-ray, it lives up to standard set by `Casino Royale' with a perfect 10 in both the video and audio category.  Simply a must own Blu-ray for Hi-Def audio and video enthusiasts!<br /><br />The 22nd James Bond film and the sequel to the critically acclaimed hit \\"Casino Royale\\" (2006) is now out on Blu-ray.  With \\"Casino Royale\\" one of the highly hailed Blu-ray release with perfect video and audio quality, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is a release that audio and videophiles will have high expectations for.  How well does the Blu-ray treatment of \\"Quantum of Solace\\" come when compared to its predecessor?  Read on!<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />The collector's edition of \\"Casino Royale\\" set the bar for many Blu-ray fans.  It achieved perfection in the audio and video category but how does \\"Quantum of Solace\\" rank against its predecessor?  It also achieves perfection.<br /><br />\\"Quantum of Solace\\" is featured in AVC @ 28MBPS at 1080p with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1.  If there is one thing to remember, Director Marc Forster and Director of Photography Roberto Schaeffer are a major duo.  Like Chris Doyle is to Wong Kar Wai, Forster and Schaeffer are just tremendous in their planning of locations and the shots they want to achieve.<br /><br />With \\"Quantum of Solace\\", from the shredded metal of the car chase scene, the blue skies and blue oceans in Haiti to the middle of nowhere in the Bolivian desert, you get a very colorful visual perspective and that is what the two have been achieving with their previous films such as \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" and \\"The Kite Runner\\".  Picture quality is amazing and action scenes coming alive on your HD set is amazing, especially when balanced with the audio.<br /><br />And for audio, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" also delivers.  The main English track is 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and the revving of the car engines to the bullets being shot, metal piercing metal, you hear it from everywhere.  A perfect score on picture and audio quality. Expect your subwoofer to take a beating and your windows and even objects on the shelf to move, because \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is just amazing to listen to.<br /><br />This is what audiophiles really want, a reference title that has audio that can match the perfection of picture quality and that is what you can expect from this release.  Both picture and audio quality achieve perfection.<br /><br />The other audio tracks in Spanish, French and Portuguese are in 5.1 Dolby Digital.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />For the special features of \\"Quantum of Solace\\", the following features are included:<br /><br />  * \\"Another Way to Die\\" Music Video -  An interesting collaboration featuring White Sripes guitarist/singer Jack White and soul R&B artist Alicia Keyes.  An unlikely collaboration and a song that fans either loved or hated.  I bought it on iTunes when it first the single was first released, so suffice to say I enjoyed it.  The music video utilized the similar MK12 style like the opening credits of the film and showcasing Jack White playing drums, playing guitar and singing while Alicia Tunes is playing piano or singing.  A very stylish music video.<br />  * Bond on Location - A 24-minute special feature featuring interviews with Director Marc Forster, the producers and the talent in regards to this film.  If there was segment that caught my attention, it was when the crew would go into these inhospitable areas and sanitize it and give something back to the community.  For the Haiti sequence, the crew redid the plumbing in order to clean the place up and in essence, gave a much better plumbing system than what the people were used to having previously.  If anything, the people on the streets were supportive of the crew but it's the diligence of the crew to get very difficult shots, which includes a sequence shot during a major event in Italy.  So, it was really interesting to see how many locations were in the film and the challenges the crew had to meet and eventually succeed.<br />  * Start of Shooting - A near three minute featurette with interviews with Forster, Craig and other talent of the expectations of this film and understanding the challenge that they face but excited of how the film is turning out to be.<br />  * On Location - A three minute featurette with interviews with Forster, talent and crew on the equipment used to film scenes like the airplane scene in Baja, Mexico and the Bolivian scenes in Panama.<br />  * Olga Kurylenko and the Boat Chase - A two minute featurette on Olga Kurylenko going through training on how to fight and even having to be part of the boat chase scene.  A scary moment for the actress who felt she was not up to par to do the scene but eventually did it and happy that she did.<br />  * Director Marc Forster - A three minute featurette with interviews with the talent and how it was for them to work with Director Marc Forster.<br />  * The Music - A near three minute featurette with an interview with composer David Arnold on composing the music for \\"Quantum of Solace\\" and then getting it prepped for the orchestra.  And also behind-the-scenes of the making of the theme song by Jack White and Alicia Keyes for \\"Another Way to Die\\".<br />  * Crew Files Behind-the-Scenes Clips - There are a total of 34 crew files that were posted on the official website.  Each crew file features interviews with staff behind-the-scenes and can be played as one full 45-minute featurette or on their own.  Each crew file lasts around 1:45 seconds and actually gives you the full depth of behind-the-scenes coverage of the making of the film.  Included are on-set footage and interviews with:<br /><br />  1. Introduction by Producer Michael G. Wilson<br />  2. James Grant, Location Manager - Panama City<br />  3.

In fact, many of the special features in the previous collector's edition release were around 24-minutes long, does \\"Quantum of Solace\\" achieve perfection in the special features category?  Despite the many listings of special features, lengthwise for many of them are around three minutes long.  So, unfortunately, special features-wise, it doesn't achieve perfection but there are a good number of special features that will keep Bond fans busy for a few hours.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />With the extreme success of \\"Casino Royale\\", Daniel Craig and Director Marc Forster definitely had to face major pressure in making sure \\"Quantum of Solace\\" would also become a film that would stay in the mind of audiences and become a financial success.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" was enjoyable at all levels.  Action, romance but a storyline that was intriguing and fresh, you couldn't help but be excited for the sequel.  In fact, the collector's edition of \\"Casino Royale\\" on Blu-ray is regarded as among the top releases to own and show off High Definition to your friends.  So, \\"Casino Royale\\" definitely set the bar.  The question is if they could followup the excitement with the sequel.<br /><br />\\"Quantum of Solace\\", the film now under Marc Forster's (\\"The Kite Runner\\", \\"Stranger than Fiction\\", \\"Finding Neverland\\", etc.) direction made me excited.  For one, Forster is good in bringing digital art like he had in \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" by bringing back MK12 to do the opening credits and also the computer technology in the film which was very cool to see.  But moreso that his film focuses primarily on storyline and character development.<br /><br />And with Paul Haggis (\\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\", \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\", \\"Million Dollar Baby\\", \\"Crash\\", etc.) and previous Bond film writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade writing the film, you definitely had high expectations for the film.<br /><br />If one thing that I enjoy about Forster as a director is that he and Director of Photography, Roberto Schaeffer are an excellent duo.  They know what kind of shot to get and make things look good on screen.  With that being said, there is no doubt about the picture quality on this Blu-ray. It's perfect.  The audio quality of the film and since it's non-stop action, this is what audiophiles thrive on and \\"Quantum of Solace\\" delivers.<br /><br />But what separates \\"Quantum of Solace\\" and \\"Casino Royale\\" is that the writers went a different direction with the sequel.  The film focuses more on non-stop action and unlike \\"Casino Royale\\", not so much on the overall plot.  That is where \\"Casino Royale\\" shined.  The many layers given to the storyline and Daniel Craig's character and to show the various complexities and to test everything about James Bond and put him in the worst situations as possible but to see him emerge from it.<br /><br />\\"Quantum of Solace\\" has James Bond going the path of a Dark Knight's Bruce Wayne.  A man who wants revenge, a stoic man who seems distant and cold and if anything, our minds stay fixated on the action and beautiful cinematography but by the end of the film, you feel that you missed out on those small intricacies of character development.  I felt no true chemistry between James Bond and Camille, whereas the staple of James Bond films is that Bond and major female lead (or multiple female) bond.  Camille is so emotionally tortured that she's seeking out revenge that she spends more time kissing the film's antagonist Dominic Greene.  So, that was a bit surprising.  And if we do get any bonding, it's with Bond and HQ office girl Strawberry Fields which was a bit short of a short trist.<br /><br />And when M restricts James Bond's credit cards and privileges, you think if he's going to go the Jason Bourne route or even show some urgency or emotion of what HQ is trying to do to limit his access.  You don't feel any of that.  If anything, James Bond's demeanor is the same, cold and stoic.<br /><br />And because this film is a sequel, before watching \\"Quantum of Solace\\", you may want to rewatch \\"Casino Royale\\" again to catchup on certain characters and what transpired because \\"Quantum of Solace\\" references quite a bit to \\"Casino Royale\\".<br /><br />With that being said, I still enjoyed the film.  As mentioned, Forster and Schaeffer are an excellent duo, so I expected beautiful imagery, awesome locations and the crew went all out in making surethe action sequences and the locations looked great on film.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray disc, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" scores nearly perfect on picture quality and audio quality.  Although, the special features seems aplenty, many are only two minutes long but still, you get the \\"Crew Files\\" that were video blogs from the Website and more.  This is going to be a release that High Definition fans are going to go crazy for.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is what one comes to expect from High Definition and like it's predecessor, technically \\"Quantum of Solace\\" Blu-ray achieves perfection.that would stay in the mind of audiences and become a financial success.    \\"Casino Royale\\" was enjoyable at all levels.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|I have long been a fan of the Legendary Clint Eastwood and the beautiful and talented Angelina Jolie.  \\"Changeling\\" has only deepened that admiration and respect. This story broke my heart as I sat transfixed for 142 soul-wrenching minutes.  This is a well acted, well crafted, and well directed film.  It is my understanding that the source material for the screenplay was meticulously researched and it shows.  Great effort went into recreating the look, feel, and atmosphere of this long ago era, and all of this effort is not lost on this viewer as I deeply appreciate historical accuracy.  Every actor was exceptional in their parts, right down to the little tyke who portrayed the doomed Walter Collins.  I purchased this DVD on February 17, 2009, and I'm glad that I did. A truly great addition to any movie collection. Based on the true story of Christine Collins whose 9 year old son, Walter went missing on March 10, 1928.  It was later learned that Walter Collins had been kidnapped, sexually assaulted and murdered by Gordon Stewart Northcott, a notorious pedophile and prolific serial killer.  Northcott was convicted of killing 20 young boys and he was executed at San Quentin prison on October 2, 1930.    \\"CHANGELING\\" (2008) Starring: Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich, Colm Feore, Jeffrey Donovan, Jason Butler Harner, Eddie Alderson, Amy Ryan, and Gattlin Griffith as Walter Collins.  DIRECTED BY:  Clint Eastwood  RUNTIME: 142 Minutes  RATING:  R For violent and disturbing images, brief nudity, and language.  PRODUCED BY:  Ron Howard and Brian Grazer for IMAGINE ENTERTAINMENT and Clint Eastwood.  SCREENPLAY BY:  J.Michael Straczynski  GRADE:  A+    SEE ALSO: The Wineville Chickencoop Murders, Sarah Louise Northcott, Sanford Wesley Clark, and Jesse Pomeroy    Recommended Reading:  \\"Nothing is strange with you\\" The life and crimes of Gordon Stewart Northcott by James Jeffrey Paul  \\"Fiend\\" The shocking true story of America's youngest serial killer by Harold Schechter  \\"The Road out of Hell\\" by Anthony Flacco
B0013N7AD8|5.0|In order to convey where I'm coming from, I was never able to see the original Batman or the equally stunning Batman Returns in theaters when they were initially released. I figured that these new Blu Ray discs in combination with my high definition monitor. Well, I was beyond blown away with the image transfers from DVD to Blu Ray. As one would expect, with each progressing film the picture gets better. But even Batman and Batman Returns look great, especially considering how old the source material is. This is, without a doubt, a must have for any die-hard Batman fan if you want to experience the first four films in the highest quality available. Noteworthy is the fact that although the less than impressive third and fourth films are a bit goofy, they do look visually stunning on Blu Ray. If there is any silver lining for \\"Forever\\" and \\"B&R,\\" it's the fact that the colors jump off the screen.
B000069HZP|5.0|Now apply heat to the canvas ...<br /><br />Some of the best storytelling, historically, starts off with a quick preface of sorts that gives some foreshadow or insight into something that's going to unfold in front of you in a very insidious way. Most of the time, the majority of observers and readers never see any of it coming. And that's always the point of it, too.<br /><br />In the case of `The Game', I think it's safe to say now that no one saw any of it coming and there was nothing predictable about what David Fincher was trying to pull off. Those that say something to the contrary are probably lying to save face. Those folks might also tell you that they saw Bruce Willis being dead in `The Six Sense', too. Don't get mad if I spoiled it for you with either film, it's been over a decade for both - you should've seen it.<br /><br />So what kind of a mind would even think to envision something as dark as CRS and all that follows? Fincher pulls out all the stops and beats the viewer with a stick from the first moment to the very end.  And to his credit and not detriment, either.  Fascination with the Godon Gecko archetype is about as timely now as any other time in history. I can see this film making a comeback of sorts either on cable or as a touchstone, with perhaps even a follow-up production to come.<br /><br />The question is: \\"What binds us together?\\" -- Money? Reputation? Class division? Gold-plated lifestyle? Family? Love? Death? Apathy? It's a very simple question that leads us down a dark road to a very complicated answer with Sean Penn screaming at us in frustration. It's almost like a dream, or a nightmare depending on how you see the world. The idea of tinkering with a person's framework of mortality and whittling away at it slowly is enough to send the most hardened minds into a state of panic. Dead parents, suicide, invasion of privacy, paranoia, blackmail, embezzlement and so on. Watching the master of controlled emotions have his most epiphanic meltdown may be one of the great silver screen performances of all time, just because the emotions are so well documented.

B001AKF3H4|5.0|This has to be her crowning achievement. This album really seemed to hit her at the height of her career. I will Always love you has to be one of the best love songs ever written, and I get chills when I hear it still. The video is amazing,and I love how well Whitney can control her voice w/o the mariah carey dramatics. I'm every woman is a great song(i don't really listen to it cause Im  guy), but it's a song well known by every one and is very upbeat! The surprise to me was Queen of the Night! Im truly surprised this wasn't a bigger hit for her. I think that has to be one of the best pop dance songs she's ever done! It's great to see her go in  hard rock direction like Janet Jackson's Black Cat. I really love artists who are versatile when they try to pick music. Jesus Loves Me is excently sung and I'm glad she wasn't afraid to record this at a time when contemparay christian had become what it is today. I think this is her best album, crowning achievement, and to me I think it was hard for her to follow up this monster soundtrack! If anybody loves pop music, rock, or gospel, then this is the album to get. It truly is one of the best of all time!
B001NE80P4|5.0|my daughter absolutely loves this movie.  It was delivered in good fashion and extremely quickly.  Love to order off of Amazon.
B000W799NU|5.0|When I had ordered this item I was a little hesitant because it was used. I didn't want to pay full price for it and figured I would give it a try. After receiving this item I was very pleased. It comes to you as if it was brand new. No scratches or anything. Very pleased will order again especially from the particular seller.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I thought this was a review for the entire set of Indiana Jones movies , But I see everyone is reviewing the latest and last Indiana jones Movie disaster. I LOVE the Indiana Jones trilogy and Want it on Blu-ray! That last movie, I won't watch. But, I love the other three!!!
B0012FCLI6|4.0|I was initially like ugh! This album looks stupid. I was too young to remember when this came,but I thought it was just going to be  filthy and trashy.I was pleasnly surprised when zune recommended this to me and I listened to this. I thought Erotica(the song)'s lyrics were really trashy but the beats made up for it.Fever was an excellent track, I thought it had a great beat and Madonna has a great jazz voice to do covers on. I thought Bad Girl was pretty good, and the video really made you think. Deeper and Deeper great techno song. Bye Bye Birdie( I think the name of the track on this album)was intersting and very good.Rain was an excellent track and I thought it was creative and different. I  had never really heard a song done in that way before. Def. really experinmental almost like a Moby track. The video had to be one of my favorite music videos of all time. I just thought thee imgaery and style was pretty cool, and way ahead of its time! I thought it was actually pretty good, and intersting and different. It was really just a pop album sheeped in wolfs clothing. I thought it was some of her best work, not her best, and this album should be given her chance! If you love pop music, or techno then this the album for you.

B001JV5BIA|3.0|Perhaps one of the more memorable horror films of all time.  Known and remembered for not only being Wes Craven's first attempt at writing/directing, but also as a terrifying combination of disgusting depravities mixed with incredibly amateur acting, a completely laughable soundtrack, and some of the most inappropriate comical insertions in cinema history.<br /><br />Essentially it's a trend setter, possible one of the first to delve into the rape/revenge genre, and quite probably the grand-daddy of torture porn.  Similar to I Spit on Your Grave, which came out a few years later, Last House tackles the difficult subjects of rape and disembowelment.  Two beautiful victims fall into the hands of the absolute bottom scum of society, and from there it becomes a struggle to stay alive while the inbred criminals conjure up despicable means of physically and psychologically tormenting their victims.  It's quite difficult to see someone get tortured in such graphic fashion; there is the small appearance of snuff realism in every cringe-worthy scene.  On the other hand, vigilante justice is explored, something that seems to always grab the attention and approval of those disgusted by the previous atrocities.  In those two aspects, the movie shines.  In nearly everything else, the movie struggles.<br /><br />The soundtrack is one of the worst in history.  It's impossible to understand or describe, but picture a cat squealing on top of a braying donkey while being led by a laughing Fran Drescher at a small town carnival.  And those are the happy scenes.  Despite the tense performance by the lead villain Krug (David Hess), and a bizarrely schizophrenic Sadie (Jeramie Rain) who nearly giggles through the evil exacted upon the movie's victims, the acting is on par with a failing high school drama production.<br /><br />Overall, it's an average movie that looks incredibly aged when viewed today, but it was revolutionarily daring for the explotation horror genre, and therefore deserving of respect.<br /><br />One last note: Girls, easy on the teeth, please.last note: Girls, easy on the teeth, please.
B000A88EVE|2.0|I enjoy heady science fiction. Tarkovsky's \\"Solaris,\\" Kubrick's \\"2001\\" and John Boorman's \\"Zardoz\\" always make my  top ten list of sci-fi films.  Nicolas Roeg's \\"The Man Who Fell to Earth\\" is in no way close in class to these other classics. It is far from a fascinating film. I've seen it twice and it's the sort of film which keeps you watching simply because you're hoping SOMETHING is going to happen. Which never does. There is no sense of awe, mystery or tension in this film other than that sense of anticipation you feel believing you might be a scene away from a revelation. Unfortunately, that moment never arrives. What this film is an excellent example of is made-on-a-shoestring, freewheelingly vague, indulgent filmmaking typical of the \\"outsider\\" films of the seventies. Unfortunately, though, many of those film had some interesting elements, this film does not. It never delivers even a trace of accidental brilliance. Except for a fine cast (especially Candy Clark, who is reminiscent of \\"Susan Alexander\\" in \\"Citizen Kane\\" (in a good way), this film would have not felt out of place at a drive-in beside \\"The Legend of Boggy Creek.\\" It's really a very poor work of art, especially coming from Roeg. I suppose if you're a cineaste, and want to fill out your film history, you might think you want to see it. But I would audition it at an art house before considering adding this to your collection. There have been few sloppier, draggy films made by a major filmmaker than \\"The Man Who Felll to Earth.\\" The cinematography is even lousy. I'm giving it two stars, mainly for Candy Clark and Rip Torn's performances. Oh, yes, David Bowie is rather awful, doing his impression of Andy Warhol from another planet.  I know this is in the Criterion Collection - an amazing company - but don't forget, they also -- for some unknown reason -- gave their wonderful packaging and transfer treatment to \\"The Rock.\\"
B00138EZLI|3.0|I remember when this movie and the singles came out they were huge! But I honestly think this album is ok. My sister used to love this cd when she was a kid and would listen to it over and over again. I thought she was crazy! Haha, I actually was living in california this summer and this was one of the few cd's I had to listen to(long story short, my music subscription got cancelled). I actually liked step by step. I thought was average, but a great inspriational song. I like I believe in you and Me simply for nostalgia from when I was a kid. It's a great song and it's got a great message. I thought Joy to the world was so-so, I go to the rock, all the gospel tracks were ok. Somebody else could have sang those and they propably would have sounded ok. I'm reviewing this as a whitney album because she's only came out with 5 cd's(her own material not soundtracks) in 25+ years. She's done better stuff. I just think she was really going off of her name at this point just like Madonna.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I will admit...I'm a big fan of Joss Whedon.  I think he writes with incredible intelligence, sharp humor, and biting sarcasm.  I watched Buffy, and then Angel, and then Firefly and enjoyed them all.  My wife and I especially enjoyed the musical episode \\"Once More With Feeling\\" from Buffy and the gang (both of us still listen to the music on our mp3 players).  So when I heard that Joss had written an online musical, I went searching for it and found \\"Dr. Horrible\\".  Let me tell you, this is incredibly funny and the music is both well written and hard to forget!  Neil Patrick Harris has an incredible voice, Nathan Fillian hams it up perfectly as Captain Hammer, and Felicia Day is great as Penny.  Watch this for free on HULU.com but you'll miss the almost as equally funny \\"Commentary - The Musical\\".  I want to buy Dr. Horrible on CD now, but I'm waiting until the music from the Commentary is also available.  Eleven Stars out of Ten!  And remember...\\"the Hammer is my penis\\"
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|This movie was a childhood favorite of my kids and a movie that was not in our collection. Although it plays out differently then the original Wizard of OZ  it is a wonderful movie.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|I remember \\"Pinocchio\\" as being the first Disney movie I ever saw, although a half-century later such memories might be suspect, although I am pretty sure that the main thing I remember walking out of the movie theater way back when was Monstro the Whale.  My main impression this time was that the animation is rougher than I recalled.  Of course this makes perfect sense, because this 1940 movie is the first full-length animated film that Disney released after \\"[[ASIN:B00003CXCQ Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]],\\" although the studio was working on \\"[[ASIN:B0002YLCOM Bambi]]\\" at the same time.  But in my mind I had the level of animation being more akin to what we see in \\"[[ASIN:B0007Z9R7A Cinderella]].\\"  But compare the level of animation here with \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" the first [[ASIN:B00005KARD Mickey Mouse]] cartoon, and you can see the quantum leap that Disney had already taken in the field.  When the American Film Institute did its \\"Ten Top Ten\\" lists, \\"Pinocchio\\" was number two on the list after \\"Snow White,\\" a judgment that reflects the monumental historical importance of that first cartoon movie, because judged by creative standards \\"Pinocchio\\" is the superior film.<br /><br />Watching \\"Pinocchio\\" again and going through all of the bonus features on this 70th anniversary Platinum Edition DVD served to reinforce the idea that [[ASIN:0679757473 Walt Disney]] was a genius, a fact that needs to be driven home to those generation of Disney fans who have been born after his death and do not remember him hosting \\"The Wonderful World of Disney\\" on Sunday nights.  The two things that stood out to me where the fact that when Walt took that first big gamble with \\"Snow White\\" (critics the colors are too bright, they will hurt people's eyes to watch a cartoon that runs an hour), he already had his new two animated features in the pipeline, and that he insisted the songs in his movies move the story along.  Both of those ideas are taken for granted today, but you have to put things in the context of the times.  Walt Disney is the Moses who gets animation from \\"Gertie the Dinosaur\\" to the latest computer animated effort from the folks at Pixar.  The mantle might have been passed, but let's not forget who the person responsible for the mantle.<br /><br />Kids might like the Games & Activities included on the second disc in this set and may even recognize Meaghan Jette Martin, who sings the updated version of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" in the requisite music video (Sorry, nothing tops Cliff Edwards as Jiminy Cricket singing that particular song).  For me the attraction is all of the Bakcstage Disney materials, with the Never-Before-Seen Deleted Scens and Alternat Ending, the All-New \\"Making of 'Pinocchio'\\" featurette and the proverbial \\"Much, Much More!\\"  From the start, these Platinum Editions from Disney have been designed to cater to those of us who want to be more than casual fans of these classic full-length cartoons.  When they began putting these out the gold standard in DVD extras were the Criterion Collection films, but these Disney Platinum Editions routinely exceed those efforts.  We would be happy just to have this film on DVD, but Disney is committed to preserving its legacy by treating these classic films like cinematic heirlooms.  I have not seen a Disney Plantinum Edition that was not worth owning, and if for some reason you felt compelled to limit yourself to only five of them, then \\"Pinocchio\\" would have to be one of those five.

B00006AW2G|5.0|Yes, this is one of the greatest masterpieces of the richest era of rock 'n' roll, such as we may never see again. The tragedy of Brian Jones's death adds to the poignancy of this testimony to a bygone era. Now that we've ascertained that this is a piece of music you absolutely mustn't be without, may we address the moronic, appalling sentiments expressed in the song \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\"? Is no one bothered by the breathtaking obnoxiousness of the famous chorus, \\"...but if you try sometime, you just might find - you get what you need.\\" Is that a fact, Mr. Jagger? Seldom have more callous, thoughtless words been uttered publicly by a spoiled millionaire who had by then had more of both what he needed and what he wanted than most of us will see in our lifetimes. Look at the world: do you see tons of schlubs like us getting what they need? More likely, some thirty percent of those who are Jagger's age have already suffered coronary emergencies from stress, trying to obtain even a smallest bit of what they needed, having long given up on anything they wanted.   What a snotty brat! Someone ought to take a stack of old \\"Let It Bleed\\" vinyl and break it over his spoiled head.

B000E1MXSW|5.0|This movie is about a nun who tries very hard to make her vocation work.  She was a better Religious than many of the so-called \\"living Rules\\" around her because she did more soul-searching.  The story is a tragedy insofar as she was never able to reconcile her inability to be perfect with the many graces she was receiving by simply being, a lesson every Religious must learn in order to persevere.      It is really about all of us, our struggle to make sense of life.  Sometimes we impose a certain order on it to manage it better, but we must have a deep faith for those times when that order goes  awry.  That is when we know what having faithy truly is.  The secret is not to abandon the order and self-discipline that once served us so well, but to realize that, in itself, it is not enough and only makes sense if we have faith in God Himself.  A modern parable that deals with the same issue is the play \\"Doubt,\\" recently also made into a  movie.  Brother Alan
B00005V9IL|5.0|Remember when big Hollywood films had complex characters, interesting ideas, and cared enough to invest time in small details? \\"The Abyss\\" contains potent drama, genuine thrills, poignant beauty, and ultimately, and ending which forces us to examine ourselves as a species.

Yes, definitely Orwellian.  Alien?  Well, not really.<br /><br />\\"V\\" wants revenge for what was done to him -- he was one of many experimented on by a woman doctor who thought she was doing viral research and could not understand why the patients (i.e., prisoners, undesirables, etc.) would ignore her.

So with a Fawkes-like mask, he intends to create anarchy.<br /><br />The film revolves around several premises -- Natalie Portman  [[ASIN:B0012QE4Q2 The Other Boleyn Girl]]; [[ASIN:B001ECYW84 Star Wars Natalie Portman Padme 16x20 Color Photo]] as the victim, the love interest, the person whose parents were killed by the government; the symbology, and breaking symbols -- the media with the idea that \\"we only report the news -- fabricating the news is the job of government.\\"  Loved that line.<br /><br />Everyone in the film tries to put a spin on the violence let loose by \\"V\\".

Get the picture?<br /><br />Natalie's portrayal as a prison victim, getting her head shaved, being dragged by her feet, hot scalding water torture -- not unlike a post-9/11 Gitmo prison, eh?<br /><br />Recommended film -- not so much for its political message which gets pounded in like a sledge hammer -- but for the developing romance between \\"V\\" and Evie.

B001RIY49C|4.0|Gosh in my entire DVD collections, Terminator 2 is the worst one as I spent so much on double/triple dipping from the Ultimate Edition to the Black Edition to the Extreme Edition...<br /><br />When it was initially released in Blu-ray, I got it though knowing it has no extended scenes. Now here comes another edition that will suck our money again!<br /><br />I really hate such marketing plot but being a T2 fan, I just can't help it...Geez if they release another edition again I shall go nuts!!<br /><br />**********<br /><br />Update: The video quality is slightly better than the original released Blu-ray but the audio quality surpassed the revious BD!<br />The previous Blu-ray release of 'Terminator 2' featured only a Dolby Digital EX mix, and no true high-res audio option but this one the studio gives us a DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 6.1 Surround track at 48kHz/16-bit which sound much superior than the old one!

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Joss Whedon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly, and Dollhouse fame has written another quirky, darkly humorous charmer with Dr. Horrible's SingAlong Blog. If you have any idea about the fascinating world of internet blogging you'll get the frustrations plaguing Dr. Horrible, played by a pitch-perfect Neil Patrick Harris, a would-be super villain promoting his evil resume via the web. Besides technical glitches, he battles his love for Penny, a kind-hearted charity organizer, and the machinations of Captain Hammer, a not-so-altruistic hero, en route to joining the top organization of criminals run by someone known only as \\"Bad Horse.\\"    The cast is superb; Neil Patrick Harris should be doing more singing roles. Nathan Fillion is hilarious, and Felicia Day is adorable.    Where this show stands out the most is the writing. Whedon is a great natural lyricist and one of the best \\"one liner\\" writers you'll ever see. You'll be laughing to yourself hours after viewing this.    Of course, the internet was a perfect vehicle for this show, but I'm sure the DVD will do equally well, if not better. Dr. Horrible's SingAlong Blog came out in the midst of the Hollywood writers' strike last year and filled the void of creativity for TV watchers everywhere, and became a sensation. I hope Whedon and company goes on to further develop this show, which was left open for a sequel or more.

B001QB9H10|1.0|This movie is another example of putting a good actor (Jason Statham) in a terrible sequel. From the beginning to the the very end this movie was unbearably bad.    Being a big fan of the original Transporter movie, I was totally disappointed in this sequel.  The plot was ridiculous, the dialogue mind numbing, and the action scenes totally ridiculous.    The female co-star, a Eurotrash brain dead girl was extremely annoying.  Her broken English dialogue consisted of talking about food (so annoying) and acting like a teenage brat.  Even the supposeably romantic love scene was totally pathetic, and lacked any real emotion.     The action was ok, but hardly made up for the rest of this cestpool of garbage.  Most of the stunts were totally unrealistic and phony. - even more so then the first two movies, imagine that!      During one fight scene, our hero gets thrown through a concrete wall and gets up without a scratch..... so ridiculous. In another scene, after the transporter drives his car into a lake to escape the bad guys, he is able to float his car back to the surface, by inflating two duffel bags with air from the tires.  Yeah, thats really going to work on a 3700 lb car.. give me a break.  And then after 2 minutes of tinkering with the engine of a car that was emerged under water for 20 minutes, he is able to start it right up and the car drives like new.... haha.      I paid $1 at redbox to rent this movie, and still feel like I've paid too much. What a piece of crap this movie turned out to be. Don't waste your time!
0307454894|4.0|the book is very straight forward. the twist is the holocaust n the responsibility of being involved n not involved. i have a feeling the movie will be more graphic about the horrors of the holocaust. the book talked about a man's feelings for a woman who was a guard in one of the camps. she was human n paid a price for that.

B001DJ7PR8|3.0|First of all, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. Bohemian life style has always fascinated me. It was beautifully filmed on fantastic location; acting was mostly good, at least Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem delivered; it was fast-paced and never boring.<br /><br />However it left me thinking: So what? It seems both Vicky and Christina (as well as everybody else in the story)after being through the events of the movie, came out completely untouched by them. Vicky remained pragmatic and unable to do anything drastic to change her life, Christina was still unsatisfied and unsure about what she wanted in hers.<br /><br />So what was the point of all this?
B001MYIXAC|3.0|When watching the initial preview for Twilight, the critics skewered it and recommended that everyone watch this film instead. Generally having trust in most critics and being a lover of Independent an Foreign films, I took their advice. I actually did not go see Twilight because of the reviews until my 13 yr. old begged me to take her after a month in theaters. To my surprise I really enjoyed it and went to see it again. Then I rented \\"Let the Right One In\\" to compare and see if the critics were right. The cover boded chills and a surreal horror for me. But try as I might, I just COULD NOT get into this movie! Admittedly there are a few chilling scenes, like when the young vampire girl comes into her neighbors house \\"uninvited\\". But the stretches of quiet, but somewhat mundane scenes in between became difficult to endure. Soon I started wondering, \\"how long is this movie? Is it almost over?\\" Which is never a good sign. And one scene involving vicious attack cats had me laughing out loud. Which is bad since it was the only major reaction I had to the movie. Don't take me for some bourgeois American who only sees what the masses want. I love art house film. But I won't say that I love something just because it IS an art house/foreign film. I rented this movie with high expectations but was rather let down ... and surprised to find out that I was far more entertained by a mainstream movie about teenaged vampires than this slow and lukewarm film about a bloodthirsty prepubescent. Just my opinion though!
0439023483|5.0|I'm not going to bother re-summarizing the plot here because other reviewers have done a good job of it already. Just a warning, there is a tiny spoiler in the two last paragraphs.<br /><br />I refused to read this book for a long time, convinced I would hate it. My reason for this was twofold, firstly, the plot sounded suspiciously similar to Battle Royale and yet I never heard the author say anything acknowledging that she was influenced by it so I was annoyed at her, thinking \\"How dare she not give a nod to her predecessors?\\" so even though I absolutely love stuff like Battle Royale and Survivor, I gave this book a pass. The other reason was because Stephenie Meyer recommended it (if she recommended it, it MUST be horrible, right?) but as it turns out, I was wrong!<br /><br />I was literally trapped, held hostage in my bed with this book, hungry and thirsty alongside of Katniss because I was so wrapped up in the damned thing I couldn't even stop enough to go to the kitchen and grab something!<br /><br />I've gone through the bad reviews most of which cite the Battle Royale thing (at this point I'm willing to give her the 'no idea is truly original' line because she put her own twist on it and really made it unique.) or the idea that the story lacks the ability to create a feeling of suspension of disbelief (OH COME ON, AND BATTLE ROYALE DOES??? Really now! I'm the person who wanted to give an author a 1-star review because she had to nerve to write that there is a Dunkin' Donuts in LA, I think this book did alright considering we are all meant to go into it knowing that it's a YA fantasy dystopian-future sort of book. Do you seriously need a whole historical essay on HOW this society got the way it is and how the Hunger Games relates to this? No. Just take Katniss's word on it that the Hunger Games are there to break the spirit of the people and remind them of their place.<br /><br />SPOILER : Anyway another reviewer said that there are \\"zombie werewolves\\" in the book. There aren't! they are just genetically mutated wolves (with an interesting twist I won't reveal) they are definitely NOT zombies or werewolves! There are genetically mutated species throughout the book so the wolves are really not a big shock at all.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving the book 4.75 stars instead of 5 is because I wanted the ending to be longer. i don't want to wait until the next book to see what happens next! I also want to know what happens with a certain gift someone gave Katniss and i was disappointed that that too will have to wait for the next book.st genetically mutated wolves (with an interesting twist I won't reveal) they are definitely NOT zombies or werewolves!

0316017922|5.0|This is a VERY thoughtprovoking book!  Causes one to take a second look at the world and how it functions.  Gladwell did an excellent job of explaining the concept and supporting research in a way that is easily understandable.

B001GJ1QQG|5.0|I bought the Deluxe edition of this album, after only sampling a few songs.    I love this album, more than the others! Though most people have a tendency to compare her to other artists I think it would be the wrong way to go. While listening to the album I realized how much less Hip-Hop and RnB it is compared to her previous work. Maybe due to production changes, but I think it goes deeper. There is a definite change in the artist this time around. The album's vibe is a lot more natural, I thought the songs flowed much better. Also, it's F-U-N. Sometimes I got the impression she was trying to go slightly disco.     In any case, the change is in image, sound and feeling. It's an enjoyable album with a wide variety of song types. It's  refreshing and never boring.    I recommend!
0060557818|3.0|I'll admit it. I was charmed and bemused for a good long while into the novel. Gaiman can be quite witty in that British way, and I was drawn into the strangeness of a haunted world below and alongside our own London. But after a couple hundred pages, the endlessly cute remarks become just a bit too much (\\"he awoke in his own vomit. Well, hoped it was his own.\\") Our hero, Richard, is the bumbling Brit. He's not Mr. Bean, but he's that lovable nitwit of English humor--the earnest cad surrounded by sharper and more biting characters. By the end, of course, our hero manages to make something more of himself.     At a certain point, though, one begins to see that the book is more comic book than novel. The characters are two-dimensional, the story based on twisted Tube station names, and the play of events quite predictable. And there's the relentlessly intrusive charm and wit of the author, who can't go more than two paragraphs without his little remarks.     There are other issues, such as the dramatic introduction of soon-to-be-forgotten places and characters (particularly the rat-speaker, rats, and Floating Market), but Gaiman generally guides us with a competent hand. Croup and Vandemar are delightful characters, and Richard's wide-eyed bewilderment helps to introduce us to the horrors and ways of London Below.     About two thirds through the book, the tale sounds more like a screenplay than a novel, as if the author was merely novelizing the movie dialog and action sequences. Worse still, like a limited-budget television series, the book concludes in a mad rush. There is a quick farewell to all of the characters and a silly little ending. It's all in good fun, so long as your patience for English wit is high and your expectations are low.
B001KVZ6FC|1.0|Cartoonish and laughable. Only actors were Clint and the barbershop guy. Rest were monotone readers. Could do same dialogue as \\"spoof\\" of Eastwood's other movies-tough guy vigilante-bad guys-gangs-over the top ethnic slang for almost every nationality and race. Clint could play role like \\"All in the family\\" character while other actors would be stupid comic types. I did laugh out loud at the stupid cliche' ridden dialogue and situations.

B00005N56Y|5.0|This is Mozart playing at its peak. Clifford Curzon is associated with Mozart's concertos in the same way as Schnabel is with Beethoven's sonatas. Not to say Curzon is the last word in Mozart's concertos, as there is very strong competition from Rubinstein, Haskil, Casadesus and Serkin. Gilels also recorded a No.27 that is superb. Sadly, none of these artists recorded the complete set, other than Serkin's rather lame rendering with Abbado when Serkin was in his 80's and well past his prime. Nos. 20 and 27 are conducted by the multi-talented Benjamin Britten with the ECO, which offer fine support. But the pearls of this set are the 23rd, 24th and 26th, conducted by the grossly underrated Istvan Kertesz, accompanied by the LSO. While Kertesz is best known for his Dvorak, he shows in these performances a great affinity for Mozart as well. Curzon's playing is brilliant and tasteful throughout this excellent 2 disc set from Decca, with very good sound.

B000286RKW|4.0|Maybe it was all of the hype that this movie has as baggage, but I just don't think of this movie as better than the Godfather (and there are people that do). Don't get me wrong, I thought it was really good, but it has some problems. I couldn't believe the continuity problems this movie has. For example, when Ray Liota is in prison, his kid's toy blocks keep appearing and disappearing or they are in different positions. That is just one scene, and I can remember at least two other times when it happens. It is just really distracting and pulls me out of the movie. The movie also has some slow spots and is best during the second act. Overall, a good film, but I actually like Casino more than I liked this movie.
B001DHIYBQ|5.0|This was instantly recognized by me as a standout with blazing guitar work, solo's etc. over the top riffs at a thrashing speed. I say they broke new ground with this Lp. The Victims of Deception I remember as being good too, I actually had that cd in the 90's from Columbia House or BMG from their .99 bin probably. Glad to see it's in stock now, probably due to my searches about 2 years ago. gotta love the technology and internet.
B000GGSMB2|4.0|It's a really drawn out movie that really didn't need to be, but it doesn't stop Scarface from being really fun. There is no denying that Al Pacino is one of the kings of American actors and he is as good as ever. How can anyone really hate this movie when the acting and writing is so good that it makes the bad guys look good?<br /><br />I think that this movie made more of an impact then than it would if it was made now. The reason being that this was such a hardcore movie back then, that they had to fight to give this an R rating. By the today's standards, the movie is kind of tame. So, it's easy to be jaded watching this movie now, but this really added something to the genre that was missing. Scarface, like the Godfather before it, once again emphasized the human side of \\"criminals\\". This movie definitely shows grey and nothing is black and white. You can't help but almost cry when watching the last few minutes of the film.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Halleluiah!   What a fabulous movie.  Why it was not a huge box office draw is a mystery because it is utterly delightful.  Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are magic together.  The Australian landscape is breath-taking and the epic nature of the story was reminiscent of Gone With the Wind.  It provides an authentic sense of the aborigines and the heart-breaking problems they faced.  It was so beautiful to watch that I was mesmerized.    Bravo Bravo Bravo for an outstanding work of art.
B001TODO54|4.0|I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. While female heroes/strong characters and super-endowed characters are both not new concepts, Kristin Cashore gave them new spin and momentum. The book leaps forward from the first pages and takes you with it. I have a habit of reading Amazon reviews before reading the actual book and that kind of tips me off to what annoyed/bothered/perturbed other reviewers, so here goes:<br />One reviewer mentions that there is a strong anti-marriage message. I wouldn't put it that harshly; Katsa (our female \\"lead\\") does seriously consider marriage as an option, but for her she doesn't think it will work. True, marriage is presented as 'confining' and that it will make her lose herself, but I think the message was situation-specific. And how many of us are considered graced killers for the majority of our lives before being given the oppurtunity to form a positive self concept? Overall I thought the book was great with several suprising twists and great character development. Katsa, though she sometimes seems cold, calculating and remote, is a character you come to care about. Po (our male \\"lead\\"), is also a wonderful character, even though I hated his name(s). The only part of the book I can honestly say had me losing a little interest was the extended escape-sequence with Bitterblue, but I got the edgy, desperate feeling of the escape through that and also the mind-numbing, blurred days; and then the book speeds back up to the conclusion.<br />Fans of strong female heroes, characters you care about, thrilling fantasy and original books, enjoy!
B000YENUI6|5.0|Tattoos can tell stories. This is a small film with big ideas and is remarkably well acted. The story concerns a young pregnant girl who dies but the baby survives. A hospital worker discovers a Russian diary on the dead girl and uncovers a sinister Russian prostitution ring and befriends a Russian mobster who may or may not be able to help her. It is very dark material at times but turns out to be a surprisingly excellent film although excessive as Cronenberg's style usually is. If you like good drama and can tolerate the extreme violence then Eastern Promises just might be one of those films that actually tries to compete with what Coppola and Scorsese have put out there and does a remarkably good job of it.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This movie absolutely blew me away, even though I thought I knew what was coming. I had inadvertently stumbled across some spoilers online and resigned myself to the fact that some of the movie's mystique would be lost to me, but the opposite happened: the bits and pieces I knew had me hanging onto the edge of my chair, desperate to know what would happen next. As for the film's conclusion...I think I sat there for a full two minutes just hyperventilating, saying wow, and replaying the film in my head and piecing together all the tantalizing dropped clues- some of which I only realized were clues after I finished watching. Then (just like it says on the cover to be prepared to do), I sat down and watched the entire thing again, with my sister this time, enjoying the delicious feeling of being in the know and finally understanding every nuance. I don't know if another film has ever left me as mentally breathless as this one did!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is the classic tale of Sherwood. There have been many Robin Hoods and this is the one that they show again and again on Saturday afternoon television and for good reason because it still manages to be good fun although the English is at times is almost incomprehensible to the point that native speakers may even find themselves turning on the subtitles :) Flynn moves fast in this one. He jumps and jacks about the place at such lightening speed as to make one wish he was around the time of Bruce Lee to standoff with him. Maybe call it \\"Enter the Hood\\"? Sounds like something starring Enimem though.

B000035P5E|5.0|This a film of two halves and a bit of a surprise. It begins by being a spy story but slowly transforms into a slasher movie on a par with and a lot scarier than Halloween or Friday the 13th. Basically imagine that you live on an island and a German spy is trying to escape from England with a microfilm of photographs that could win the war for the Nazis. Imagine that this ruthless killer finds himself trapped on an island with an only family living there. It is a terrifying film and in many ways it reminds me of Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs. If you can sit through this without closing your eyes you are a brave one. Donald Sutherland is remarkably creepy.

0312383320|5.0|OMG... That is pretty much the experience I have felt summed up in a phase that explains \\"Plum Spooky\\". Anyone who has loved Stephanie Plum can understand my awe. I have missed the sadistic humor of Stephanie. Coming from the Burlington/ Bristol area, I immediately felt & understood Stephanie. I grew up w/characters similar to Stephanie being a half Italian female in the Philadelphia area. I lost my composure (to say it nicely) many times reading these novels & yes I own them all.<br />However, in the last two it felt like Janet (author) did not feel the same for Stephanie. Almost like Janet was writing Stephanie's stories because it was expected not because the character was speaking through her.<br />But now Stephanie is back in all her crazy glory... I want to quote a portion of the book that speaks to the ciaos that all the readers can understand and love...<br />pg. 203. \\" How's it going?\\" Morelli wanted to know.<br />\\"It's average. Stole a truck. Blew up a house. Brought seven monkeys home with me.

006085880X|3.0|The Pact is about two teens who grew up just like brother and sister, only to become lovers as teens.  The boy is completely in love with the girl, but the girl feels trapped in a relationship that feels incestuous to her.  The book opens with the reader finding out that the girl is dead of a shot to the head and the boy is suspected of her murder.  The boy says it was a botched double suicide.  Over the course of the book, the chapters alternate between past and present.    I had a few problems with The Pact.  First of all, there were some inconsistencies here and there that stuck out.  Near the beginning of the book, we are told that Chris's sister Kate was born in either 1984 or 1985.  A little later, we find out she's twelve in November/December of 1997, which sounds about right.  And then, in May of 1998, she's turning fifteen.  There's also the fact that we find out in multiple places that Chris is six months older than Emily.  But near the end of the book, he says he's three months older than her.  It's possible that Picoult made changes here and there and forgot to go back and make the appropriate edits, but I just thought that those were pretty big mistakes, especially the one with Kate.  When an author can't even keep a character's age straight, that's not good.  It kind of reinforced my idea that Kate was essentially useless to the plot.  I don't know why she was in the book at all.  Even if it was only an editing problem, this book really should have been edited better.       I didn't really find the ending to be unbelievable.  It came out just the way I would expect it to come out if someone in Chris's position stood accused of the very severe charge of first-degree murder.  I mean, you can never assume, and life doesn't always work out the way you would expect it to. Sometimes it throws you a curveball.  And sometimes it doesn't.  It could go either way.  And that's all I'm going to say on that because I don't want to get too specific about the ending.I do wonder why he was charged ONLY with first-degree murder, and there was no option for the jury to convict him of a lesser charge.  Is that realistic?  I don't know.  I guess it depends on the state, right?  How does it work in NH?    Anyway, I think that the court drama was set up in a way that, no matter how it ended, it would have been anti-climactic because it's really not at all about whether or not Chris gets convicted.  It's about Emily and Chris and their relationship.  And it's about the gray areas in life, and the things that people would rather not know about their kids.  I did find Chris's behavior throughout those last few years of Emily's life to be inexplicable, though.  First of all, I wonder if it was really necessary to have this boy who supposedly loved Emily be so sexually aggressive toward her.  I understand that he was frustrated, but when a girl says no and the boy keeps on making unwanted advances, that conjures up a particular kind of young man in the reader's mind.  If Picoult was hoping for the reader to have any sympathy for him whatsoever, I don't think that was a wise choice on her part.  I think she went overboard there.  I think Chris could have still been pushy without literally assaulting Emily nearly every time they were together.  I realize that guys do stuff like that all the time in real life, but not in a book where the author is trying to make you feel like the boy has even a shred of respect for the girl.  I mean, if she wanted this relationship to seem different than your average teen romance, she should have made it less predictable.  I'm not one for making characters into black and white angels or devils---I believe in the shades of grey---but there were no real shades of grey in their relationship.  It was just Chris acting like a jerk and Emily being secretive and depressed.    Finally, I really don't know why it took Chris so little time to come to the conclusion that Emily would be happier dead.  I mean, this whole shooting occurred only a month after she first told him she wanted to commit suicide.  That's not a very long time to be depressed.  Considering that he's known her her entire life, I would think it would take him a bit longer to come to the conclusion that she's damaged beyond repair.  I mean, maybe if this was something they'd been talking about for years, I would understand his dilemma.  I wouldn't necessarily agree with his conclusion, but I would understand what he was struggling with.  But he seemed to jump to the conclusion that there was only one way out quite quickly.  And considering the fact that he never did find out her main motivations for wanting to die, I just don't see why he would be so ultimately accepting of her decision.  I think the problem was that Picoult knew what was going on in Emily's head and so she forgot that Chris wouldn't have been privy to that knowledge.  That's a problem I've encountered as a writer myself---getting ahead of your characters and the thoughts they would be realistically thinking at each stage of the book.  And sometimes you even forget to put all the important information you know about the characters within the actual lines of the book.      Oh, and there was a molestation plotline in the novel that felt like overkill.  There was already a quasi-incestuous relationship, teen sex and the repercussions of it, a suicide pact, a dead girlfriend, a courtroom drama, and so on.  Was it really necessary to have sexual abuse as well?    I think that this was a poignant story and it did move me, particularly in the end, until I really stopped to think about it and realized that it was a bit rushed.  I really enjoyed reading it and I think Picoult is a great storyteller.  But I think that her situations can be quite cliche, and her characters often behave oddly, as if their actions are being manipulated to serve the plotline.  Also, I've read two books of hers now, and I feel myself not really getting to know the charactersall that well because so much of their personalities are wrapped up in the central drama of the book.  There are some layers there, but I feel like the characters never make it past that initial stage they were in when Picoult first started writing the book, and that's probably because she publishes these books so fast.  There's very little room for discovery for the author, which means there's very little room for discovery for the reader.  I think that's the downside of being a popular author and having all these demands placed on you.  Unless you're a brilliant writer, and perfect in every way, I don't think a book per year is enough time to really get that deep into the life of a person, let alone a group of people.  You can certainly skim the surface, and that feels like what Picoult often ends up doing.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am 32 years old and struggle with high blood pressure and I'm over weight about 50 lbs because I'm only 5 feet 2 inches. My doctor recommended for me to start exercising or I would have to be on the high blood pressure pill. I had a baby 2 yrs ago and I've been too lazy to work out lying to myself that the baby weight would eventually come off. Nope....still got those baby weights. So I went and did some research and bought this DVD just to try it out because I heard it's only 20 minutes of workout and that includes warm up and cool down.<br /><br />At first I was really skeptical about this DVD. Thinking how can this work? Will it be too hard for me since I NEVER exercise? At first, it was hard for a beginner. The cardio moves was too hard for me to keep up. So I did slow down and got a drink of water. So for the first day, I could not do the full 20 minutes. I woke up feeling my legs and arms burn so badly I could not walk up the stairs at work. I haven't had this feeling for a looonnnng time and I must be nuts but I felt great knowing it works!!!<br /><br />So I gave it another go 2 days later. This time....(ha!) I did the entire video including the cardio and I sweat like crazy!! I really did feel great! After 2 weeks into this video (it's not a miracle DVD so I had to eat right too) I lost a total of 6 lbs and noticed my clothes feels better. I went and bought her other DVD's too. Now I alternate between her No more Trouble Zone when I don't feel like doing so much Cardio to this one. I lost a total of 20lbs in 2 months and my abs and arms looks great. It's only March, I'm confident that if I keep this up, I will at least feel great by summer!!! So for someone who cannot afford the gym (Like me) who also has a toddler at home (like me) who never exercised before (like me) who wants to do a short intense workout (like me) who wants to see results fast (like me).....I strongly recommend this DVD!!! I hope this helps you since it helped me!!!

0385512058|2.0|Never Eat Alone purports to be a book on how to establish a network. Instead it is a testament to author Keith Ferrazzi's king-sized ego.    Ferrazzi pays lip service to networking as a means of helping others while helping yourself. Instead, what the book mostly conveys is that Ferrazzi is a shallow user who tries to impress his readers by name dropping (Hillary Clinton, Barry Diller, Michael Milken, Howard Dean, Arianna Huffington, etc.).    Ferrazzi's advice is often unintentionally revealing. He admits that he often calls people when he knows that they will not be in the office; that way he can maintain his connection to people without having to waste his time actually talking to them. Without any sense of irony, Ferrazzi approvingly quotes Machiavelli when he discusses \\"building your brand.\\" (\\"Everyone sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are\\" (p. 230)). Ferrazzi states that he writes \\"Here's another one of Ferrazzi's shameless attempts at self promotion\\" (p. 245) when sending emails to his many contacts.     In fairness, Ferrazzi does have a few good points regarding the value of networking. There is also some decent material on how to engage others while attempting to build a connection. Beyond those points, Never Eat Alone is unengaging.    This was the first networking book that I had ever read; but surely there must be much better options out there.

B001P3SA94|5.0|This movie is a great reference to a part of the history of American music that is way overlooked--Chicago Blues. Most people don't realize that Muddy Waters was, by way of musical lineage, one of the fathers of rock and roll. But the most important aspect of Muddy's (as well as that of Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, et al) place in musical history is the music itself--Chicago Blues. Even if rock and roll, heavy metal, and hip hop were never invented, these blues icons would still be marked in history for their achievements in Chicago blues music. 2003 was the 100th anniversary of the blues, and despite Martin Scorsese's noble effort in recognizing this with his PBS documentary of the Blues in that year, I didn't notice much of a blues revival stemming from that year. It's nice to have movies like this that remind us from time to time what the roots of American music really are!    I was really impressed with the actors in this movie--they did a great job in portraying their respective characters, including their own singing, which was great! I was particularly impressed with the authenticity of Jeffrey Wright's both singing and acting aspects of the portrayal of Muddy Waters.    Some of the details of this story are skewed for effect in this movie, I'm sure, but overall I found it faithful enough in its depiction of how it all came about and went. I must say, though, that I find it hard to believe that Howlin' Wolf actually threatened to kill Muddy if he stole any of his band members again. I know they were rivals, but I have trouble believing they hated each other that much--maybe I'm wrong--I was just surprised to hear something like that in the script.    Adrien Brody does a fine job of portraying Leonard Chess, but Robert DeNiro would have been PERFECT. DeNiro even looks now a lot like Leonard Chess did back then (Brody is simply much younger than Chess was at the time), and I'm sure the makeup team would have had no problem in creating a dead ringer of Chess outof DeNiro! And Chess's legendary tough-guy type attitude? That's right down DeNiro's alley! But alas, I guess they couldn't afford DeNiro, as this was a pretty low-budget film.    So despite the flak that this movie is getting in respect to authenticity, I'm giving it five stars, because it is in fact a very good movie and a great effort in preserving the memory of Chicago Blues!
006135323X|4.0|There is alot of surprising infomation in this book. Make you rethink the things that we do everyday. Gave me a diffrent outlook. Some of the chapters could have been a bit shorter and gotten to the point, overall a very informaing and entertaing read.
B0017HEYEI|2.0|Do not buy this if you can't speak the Asian Language (i can't identify which it is) that it's in.  It can be put in English, but for the money you spend on this one, you could buy one in English.

0307387178|5.0|I saw the movie before i read the book. However most people already know what happens at the end of the movie before they watch it anyways. I find the book gives more detail on who he was, and why he went into the wild rather than just what he did. It also has some other stories of people of similar experince. Overall a great read, not very long and very worth while.

B000K7VHPU|5.0|Rent this movie, you will not regret it! I dont have time to write a full review but it is very clever, very well done and just plain excellent entertainment. I was shocked that it was/is so little known. I am a HARSH movie critic, believe me, so for me to so highly recommend a film tells you it must be exceedingly worthwhile. You will not regret it! This was the best movie I have seen in YEARS.<br /><br />God bless you,<br /><br />DS
0765356139|5.0|This book, along with the rest of the trilogy, is one of the best, most entertaining books I have read in a while. I wouldn't say I'm the most prolific reader, working on a Masters degree and preparing to start my Doctorate program can be a bit time consuming, but after reading a little of the first book to get a taste for the series, I made time for it.    All of the books in the series are very well written, and the characters themselves are very believable. I would recommend the series to anyone with any interest in a good read.

B000IY03DM|5.0|What can I say? I love Il Divo!! Their music is soothing and romantic. This is my third one that I have bought and I will buy their others. It is not a disappointment to me that several of their songs are in other languages, it's just makes for a richer and more fulfilling Il Divo musical experience. The Amazing Grace song on their CD The Promise is the most beautiful rendition I have ever heard! Watch it on YouTube it brings tears to my eyes.

B000002UAO|5.0|I know it is sacrilege to not like the Beatles, and I actually do like the BEatles  It is more though that I prefer the records where they started esatblishing more of their identity and what was going to come.    Rubber Soul is the record that has them crossing both worlds and Norweigian Wood, Nowhere Man and Michelle are indicators of where the band was heading.  No longer just a rock and roll band, the creative jump here was always to me one of the largest.    The songs became more complicated Michelle portends more ballads, while Norweigian Wood and Nowhere Man the psycheddelia and lyric development.    They grew up here.
B000MCIBB6|4.0|After \\"Strange Days,\\" The Doors found themselves occupied with touring and other secular matters.  As a result, the songs on \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" are not as strong as those on their first two efforts, and the group is given more to repetition of prior musical riffs.  There is (mostly) a change in tone to beauty from night-world, but the songs are all over the place, giving the album an incoherent character.  Controversy was the name of the game for The Doors, and \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" had its contribution to this.      \\"Hello I Love You,\\" contrary to what many believe, was not a quickly constructed pop song under pressure to achieve a #1 single.  It was one of six songs submitted on demo tapes to Columbia records in 1965 that did not lead to a contract.  \\"Hello\\" has been overly maligned over time, as some amusing lyrics compensate for its poppy structure.  Also, guitarist Robby Krieger has stated the inspiration for its riff was Cream's \\"Sunshine of Your Love,\\" not The Kinks' \\"All Day and All of the Night.\\"  The pretty \\"Summer's Almost Gone,\\" with nice slide guitar from Robby, is the other entry here from those demos.    \\"Not to Touch the Earth,\\" the only part of \\"The Celebration of the Lizard\\" worth much, is the strongest track.   It conveys powerful images as Jim Morrison roams through his visual wilderness supported by hard-driving and menacing music.  The group displays its talents in achieving a colorful bleakness:  e.g., \\"rugs silent, mirrors vacant\\").  The plan had been to include the entire \\"Celebration,\\" but that was bagged in favor of merely including the lyrics on the vinyl sleeve.  Now, the original plan is realized through the bonus tracks (see below).      Morrison wrote two more strong songs.  \\"The Unknown Soldier,\\" another solid theater piece, has artistic antiwar lyrics by Morrison (but its instrumental line sounds like \\"My Eyes Have Seen You\\").  \\"Love Street,\\" biographical of Jim's love Pamila Courson, is a very pretty and evocative ballad, with amusical chorus that seems like a rework of \\"The Crystal Ship.\\"      Morrison's political \\"Five to One\\" lacks musical refinement, but it has some memorable lines like \\"no one here gets out alive.\\" The a cappella \\"My Wild Love\\" takes us nowhere special, and the weak \\"We Could Be So Good Together\\" (with traces of \\"Break on Through\\") is one of the worst Doors songs ever.      If some of the above sounded \\"un-Doors-like,\\" Robby Krieger's songs were even more so.  Still, the pretty flamenco \\"Spanish Caravan\\" was often played in concert. \\"Yes, the River Knows\\" is a ballad that is somewhat distended, but it does have pretty guitar lines.  The schmaltzy waltz \\"Wintertime Love,\\" if (certainly) not the group's worst song, is perhaps its most un-Doors-like song as Ray dishes out non-minor-note harpsichord.      Bonus Tracks:  Among the reworked CDs of the Doors' six studio albums, \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" offers the best bonus tracks.  \\"Albinoni's Adagio\\" is very pretty, and the \\"Lizard King\\" gives us more to Celebrate with.  This CD has interesting alternate takes of \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\" that do not sound just like the original.  Then, there is finally a \\"studio\\" version of the Celebration.   But it is the \\"Absolutely Live\\" version that is the true \\"studio\\" version:  It is the one we know, structured more plainly and tightly performed.  The bonus version is more free-flowing than its predecessor.  Its streaming instrumentation meanders more, with more sound variety.   The level of originality and adventure, beauty and menace, is increased in this version.   The Doors and their reptilian leader cruise to new \\"cool air heights.\\"

B000MG1ZFQ|4.0|\\"The Soft Parade\\" was the least well-received of the six Doors studio albums, at least among the critics, but many people like it. More than any other Doors album, it provokes disagreements on its merits.  I will do my best here, and in any event, my comments are somewhat in between.  Like many, I believe \\"The Soft Parade\\" is the group's weakest effort, but this is measured against a very high standard.     What is clear is that The Doors' power, in full display in the group's first two efforts, was fading during this period.  This is true not only in the case of guitarist Robby Krieger's brass/string-backed songs but lead singer Jim Morrison's songs.  Nevertheless, the Morrison compositions \\"Wild Child\\" and \\"Shaman's Blues\\" contain excellent lyrics, the former being accompanied by an interesting primitive beat with the Doors trademark sound. \\"Shaman's Blues,\\" too, is Doors-like in hypnotic feel, and it creates a compelling mood.    Along with these two, the title cut is the highlight of the album.  \\"The Soft Parade,\\" also strong lyrically, compares favorably to the band's other long cuts. The music in this five-part suite is incoherent, but still interesting.  Isolation and self-realization at the beginning give way to the simple, steady progression of the latter parts, which contain a parade of striking images.      As for Robby Krieger's entries, I liked \\"Touch Me\\" when I was younger and still do, but I am now ambivalent because of its pop excesses.  \\"Tell All the People\\" even supersedes those excesses, but there is still something about its melodrama I like.  Robby dedicated the un-Doors'-like \\"Runnin' Blue\\" to the recently deceased Otis Redding, but a catchy, if insubstantial, main verse is overshadowed by horns and an odd bluegrass chorus. \\"Wishful, Sinful\\" is the best Krieger entry, pretty with an underwater feel, although it is cloying at one moment too. \\"Easy Ride\\" (Morrison) and \\"Do It\\" (Morrison/Krieger) are both silly and flippant, but the former has a little more substance.    \\"The Soft Parade\\" reflects the last vestiges of the original Doors sound, somewhat degenerated. The hard rock and blues of the two subsequent releases serve as a reminder that \\"The Soft Parade\\" was not an ending or downhill point for this immensely talented band, but an inflection point for a new direction.    Bonus Tracks:  There are a fair number, but do not be enticed unless you have a special interest.  \\"Touch Me\\" is similar to the original. \\"Whiskey, Mystics, and Men\\" (basically spoken poetry) and the cocktail \\"Who Scared You\\" are available on the Box Set.
B001NFNFIK|2.0|I was looking forward to the release of this movie, since I am a big fan of Mr. Burke and his Robicheaux series.  This movie may have had a fighting chance if it was about an hour longer.  But, as released in the U.S., the movie seems like a crudely slapped together collection of short excerpts from what the real movie should have been. Tommy Lee Jones basically plays himself and the other big name characters are not given enough script to develop their characters.  Actually, given the large number of characters in the story, and the multiple story lines, this may not have been the best Burke novel to bring to the screen.  A real disappointment.
B000MCIBAW|5.0|\\"Strange Days\\" is seen by some as similar sounding, but not quite as good, as the debut it followed up. Others (like me) see it as just as good, or even better. The songs on each were written in the same period, inspired by lead singer Jim Morrison's acid-induced excesses.  They have a comparable night-world sound (perhaps \\"Strange Days\\" is more \\"twilight\\") and, at times, similiar chord progressions.  \\"Strange Days\\" songs are still distinct structurally and, of course, lyrically. The songs were crafted by meticulous producer Paul Rothchild into no-dross, structured  masterpieces that are less spontaneous and free-flowing than those on the debut.      The title cut sets the tone, with its eerie organ and guitar conjuring up spooky images: \\"strange eyes fill strange rooms\\" and \\"voices will signal their tired end.\\" The morbid side is also represented in Jim's high-school poem \\"Horse Latitudes,\\" given expression only in sound effects. It is about throwing horses overboard from Spanish ships in the ocean doldrums in days of yore, to lighten the cargo.     Perhaps the best song is guitarist Robby Krieger's \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" the only tune with no eerie texture.  It might have reached #1 had it not been for the censors of its time. It is hard blues, driving powerfully forward; Ray Manzarek intersperses with a clavinet solo in triplicate motif that could not be tighter.  It satisfies those who want a piece of raw-charged rock from The Doors but feel they do not get it enough. The other AM hit was \\"People Are Strange,\\" Morrison's negative statement about the feelings of lonely rejection.     In the spooky rocker \\"Moonlight Drive,\\" the first song Morrison wrote, he exhorts the girl to join him in a dark adventure: \\"swim to the moon,\\" \\"climb through the tide.\\" Robby dishes out a terrific blues/rock guitar solo. \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\" and \\"Unhappy Girl\\" are even more darkly seductive. The former features Robby's haunting twangs, rising and rushing to climax. \\"Unhappy Girl\\"is a remarkable studio accomplishment featuring a backward recording of Ray's minor-chord medieval organ and beautiful, piercing slide guitar by Robby.  It presents a visual image of a girl alone, \\"locked in a prison of [her] own device.\\" Jim sings, ever so sensuously:  \\"And you can't believe/What it does to me/See you/Crying.\\"    The powerful \\"My Eyes Have Seen You\\" represents the group's apex in achieving visualization of Jim's lyrics. He wrote this hypnotic song from a Venice, CA rooftop; hence \\"television skies.\\" The bass and harpsichord and Robby's vibrating, centripetal guitar charges help Jim to \\"photograph your soul.\\" For \\"I Can't See You Face in My Mind,\\" Rothchild slowed down the tempo of the group's live version of its early days. The mood is subdued, highlighted by Ray's soft, dry organ and Robby's dark lullaby guitar licks. Ray also employs a marimba, and John Densmore's cymbal hits are recorded backward. Morrison is reaching out behind an artifical mask: \\"I can't seem to find the right lie.\\"      Jim Morrison brings Antonin Artaud's \\"Theater of Cruelty\\" to the rock stage in \\"When the Music's Over.\\" It sports a neat acid-rock guitar solo by Robby and organ blasts by Ray.  But Jim dominates with a melange of spoken word poetry/exhortations: negative social commentary, rebellion, spooky images, and terror.  The music gets repetitive and Morrison's verbiage drags for many, but those who like it love it. Like Artaud, Morrison wanted to involve the audience directly in the anguish; the song became a concert spectacle.      \\"Strange Days\\" is archetypal Doors, the darkest and most sensuous:  the group at its best.  It is a monument in rock history.    Bonus tracks:  Among the CD reworks of the Doors' six studio albums, \\"Strange Days\\" offers the least in terms of bonus tracks.  For \\"People Are Strange, \\" false starts and dialogue?  So, then, what is the bonus?  The alternate take of \\"Love Me Two Times\\" is a lark but inferior to the original we know.

B001P3SA94|5.0|I loved this film. its amazing to find out what an important role blues music and later rock and roll had in the dissolving of segregation. It becomes so clear from this film that we have come such a long way in 50 years. The amazing musicians, Muddy Waters (brilliantly portrayed by Jeffrey Wright), Howlin' Wolf, another brilliant performance, of course Etta James played by Beyonce and Chuck Berry played by Mos Def all had their beautiful voices heard through music.  i think if you care about music and American History you should not miss this film!!!

B001M4YZ90|4.0|I find that Guy Ritchie's work inspires deep   feelings of love or hate!  There is no middleground among people when   it comes to him. Some see him as a ridiculous wanna-be   Scorcesse or DePalma, others see him as a fresh new voice   and vision in cinema for the 21st Century.  I enjoyed this movie and all it's rawness, dark humor,   violence and rollercoaster twists and turns!   Gerard Butler, Idris Elba & their motley crew of low dollar   thugs with ambitions for the bigtime made this movie for me!   Their interplay was priceless against the story's other very   interesting characters. I also love the cracked-out,   devil-may-care, balls-to-the-wall portrayal of the ROCK-N-ROLLA   himself, Johnny Quid, who is one of the main bad guy's stepson   who this whole crazy ride revolves around!--He is a hoot!     Jeremy Piven & Chris \\"Ludacris\\" Bridges play his smarmy   record company moguls who get tangled up in this wild web as well!  I don't care what anyone says!---I thought this was brilliant!  Now to prove my point of how Guy Ritchie's work polarizes people...  My mother, who watched this movie with me,   ABSOLUTELY THOUGHT IT WAS TRASH!!  You have to decide this one for yourself...
B000HIVOFU|4.0|Yes, this is an SACD but it is only two channel and it has no base track (Sub Woofer). Other than that, the sound is fantastic.
B001N26GFM|5.0|I just can't say enough about this movie!  It touches the soul and opens the mind in a way  that all great story-telling should. This was a tear-jerker  for me..especially the ending! (Whew!!)  How people's egos, arrogance, apathy and self-righteousness  can turn them into monsters without them even knowing how   wrong they really are until it's too late!   This film teaches and entertains at the same time without being  too preachy, but you know this is a thing of dire seriousness.  I can't add anything as far as the details of the story that   other reviewers haven't already said...just buy it!
0307269752|4.0|I felt it was well written and gave me a view of Sweden and big business.  It was somewhat predictable and it had one or more things that made no sense to me.  For example, for a long time our protagonist is searching obscure places for a particular scene in a photo and after many chapters, he thinks to ask the most logical character who would have had the picture if he has any pictures.  He had a big box of them.
1435101162|5.0|Jane Austen: Complete Novels [Collector's Library Editions Series] is a beautiful edition that will delight collectors of Austen's works. I have different editions of Austen's works [as she happens to be my favorite author] and was very pleased with this edition. It is a large book in hardcover, and may be a bit unwieldy for reading, but it does collect all of Austen's works in one beautiful volume. There's a biographical note in the beginning, followed by the novels beginning with Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Mansfield Park, and Northanger Abbey. There are also black and white line drawings by Hugh Thomson [1860-1920]. The paper quality if of good stock in an eggshell white and the font size appears to be about 10. A handsome edition for collectors and lovers of Jane Austen's works.

B0012YYZYK|5.0|I purchased a (March '09) Blu-ray version of \\"The song remains the same\\" that does not seem to have a dropout at timecode 1:40:45, as reported by others. The quality is exemplary - while I have no comparison with CD / DVD versions, I am very impressed with the (1080p) video as well as the (Dolby 5.1) audio quality. It is possible - I can't say this with any degree of certainty, but I recall these \\"mishaps\\" from the early days of both CD and DVD) - that the dropout is related to the chipset in use in the Blu-ray player. As far as I can see the version I picked up today is the same 2007 release, but rather than a Blu-ray player I am using a [[ASIN:B001G7OJVW Buffalo Technology BR-816SU2 External MediaStation 8x USB 2.0 Blu-ray Writer (Black)]], with video processed through a Lenovo 3000 [[ASIN:B001L9A9R8 N500 15.4\\" 1GB 160GB HDD]] HDMI laptop, and audio through a [[ASIN:B00030099O Creative Labs 70SB049000000 USB SoundBlaster Live 24-Bit External Sound Card]] processor. This setup is dedicated to Blu-ray - you don't want to read your email while playing a disk, the data throughput is massive. There are multiple different versions of the Lenovo 3000 N 500 - this is the 4233-52U version, with a Celeron 2.0 Ghz processor, and an HDMI port, expanded to 4 Gb of RAM and using a Microsoft [[ASIN:B0013O54QM Windows Vista Business with SP1 Upgrade]].

B001NE80P4|5.0|I think this is the best of the series. We went to see the movie in theaters and I had a 15 month old,5, and 8 year old and myself all remaining entertained. there is comedy,a good plot (rare for a third and Disney kid movies) and of course singing- this is the part where you may want to say No No Noooo, but really, I think it's going to be the Grease for the next generation.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This book is considered a classic for a reason.  Some books just stand the test of time, and this is one of them.  Jane Austen has an impecable manner of getting to the core of human (and especially women's) emotions. The focal point of this novel would be not to judge a person at first glace. Their true character may surprise you.
B00005S6K8|5.0|This was movie was such a pleasant surprise. I don't usually like remakes. This was a great movie the first time is was made, and I have always loved Audrey Hepburn and William Holden.I couldn't imagine how this movie could be made again,with the new casting for the remake.   I was wrong,casting was perfect and the dialogue more sharp and witty.   Julia Ormond was absolutely dazzling. She flowed through this movie with class, beauty and charm.I had never seen her before. Harrison Ford, Greg Kinear, Nancy Marchand and the rest of cast absolutely wonderful. You can't compare this movie to the other in any way. They are both so different. The wonderful Paris scenes and montages as Sabrina learns about life and her beloved Paris, the coming back for a visit to the Larrabee mansion as a knocked out looking model-type, was fabulous.  All the classic dialogue throughout between the brothers and the mother.  I see something new everytime I watch it.(and that is about 12 times)  Directed by Sidney Pollack, who is the great romantic comedy director.   The music,... no one has mentioned the great musical score. How can anyone not get hooked hearing \\"STING\\" sing the title song.....\\"In the Moonlight\\" Just dreamy. I bought the album and still listen often, yes, to STING, and the whole movie score. I absolutely love this movie, and so does my husband. When ever we are down,..and feel like a pick me up,..we say,..\\"Let's watch Sabrina!\\". We laugh everytime. Love all the warm moments, and the great ending with surprise chauffeur's wealth and love for a lovely house worker. A tear when Larrabee is waiting in the shadows for Sabrina when she arrives back home in Paris to tell her of his love.\\"Only you can save me, Sabrina-Fair\\" The perfect ending, but the perfect movie with the perfect cast, that leaves you feeling so good inside.I highly recommend this version.It leaves you wanting to see more.

0142004413|5.0|The story of Gerry Durrell and his family, who decides to move to Corfu in order to escape the inclement British weather. This book follows Gerald as he explores the island, fascinated by creatures great and small. We also get to know his family and their different quirks.<br />It is a lovely book, but beware: the language is richer, far richer than most books today. There isn't a lot of action, as the book is more like a memoir than a novel (ie it meanders, aiming at creating a picture, not following a tight plot).<br />If you keep those two things in mind, you'll enjoy it greatly, and feel as if you'd want to move to Corfu -but, alas, I went there in 2005, and Durrell's Corfu seems to have been replaced by mass tourism.

The Boss shows his excellent writing skills on this one. if you close your eyes and listen to each track, they each tell a story. every track on this CD is worth listening to.

B001TH16DI|5.0|The people giving this set negative reviews before they have seen it need to be medicated or institutionalized. The director's edition DVDs of TMP, TWOK and TUC were not the theatrical versions and were never seen in cinemas. Obviously, the high-def presentation will finally meld the best picture quality with the original versions of the movies. I don't see any real issues with that, and if someone really wants to watch the lousy new digital e-Vulcan landscape in TMP, or if they really want to experience Kirk not knowing what a pair of glasses is in TWOK, they can pop in the old DVDs or pay for blu-ray releases of those weak, weak moments when they arrive.

No filler. The opening of Battery with the slow acoustic guitars then launching into an all-out thrash fest is amazing no matter how many times you hear it. Master of Puppets is my favorite song from them. Epic masterpiece in my eyes. And to me, Orion is one of the best instrumentals I have ever heard. Its beautiful music.    Definitely get this album. Please don't listen to people giving this 1 star. They are out their minds. This is a masterpiece and will never be topped.
B000W4HFY8|4.0|When Twin Peaks first aired back in 1990, I would NEVER have watched it had it not been for the MUSIC. I never was very much into network television and Twin Peaks seemed like just another network's lame attempt to rake in a few bucks with a new \\"murder/mystery miniseries\\". I promptly dismissed the show.    A couple of months later, I heard the main title theme on a local jazz radio station. I was mesmerized! I decided to give the show a try and I was absolutely hooked. The story, actors, cinematography, music and locale all combined to create a truly unique and ground-breaking television show.    I purchased the first soundtrack in 1990 and wore it out. The themes were truly memorable and Angelo Badalamenti's genious shines through in every song. Of course, it was an incomplete documentation of the music of Twin Peaks, but it was a good start. Never had I dreamed I would have to wait 18 years for volume 2 (amazing how the show has maintained a loyal following for so long - PROOF of what an incredible show it really was).    Volume 2, although brilliant, is sadly incomplete. There is SO much more music from the world of Twin Peaks that was tragically overlooked; numerous variations of the main title theme (especially the acoustic guitar version that segues into a Rhodes piano - played when Ben Horne is watching black-and-white movies of the ground breaking ceremony of the Great Northern), Hank Jennings' theme, John Wheeler's theme, a '50s-style guitar jam (first played when James leaves Twin Peaks and is riding his Harley down the highway) and many, many others. I just hope I don't have to wait another 18 years for volume 3.    Recommended for any music lover, although this will probably appeal mostly to lovers of the show.
0812550706|5.0|I vaguely remember reading the novella length precursor to this novel at some point in the late 1970s.  It was subsequently released in its current form in 1985 and won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards in 1986.  As a result, mid way through the book, I knew what was going to happen, but that knowledge did not detract from my reading experience, and the denoument, which I don't believe was contained in the earlier novella was brilliant.<br /><br />The Earth has been attacked twice by Buggers, insect like aliens, and has barely survived.  Ender Wiggen is the result of a breeding program to develop a supreme commander for the purpose of commanding the human space fleet in order to ward off an anticipated third attack.  Ender is six years old when he is snatched from his family and put into rigorous psychological, physical and tactical training.  His training and the looming Bugger threat are the centerpiece of this novel.<br /><br />Without going too deeply into the plot and the various twists and turns, suffice it to say that this book is every bit as much about human psychology and philosophy as it is about science fiction.  The events leading to the climax involve a major plot shift and the action following the climax is magnificent.<br /><br />My only quibble with the novel is the language, actions and mindset of the very young trainees, starting at age six and advancing to age twelve.  They are simply not realistic, even in the context of genetic engineering.  Card addresses this point in an introduction, which is otherwise excellent.  He argues that advanced children do, in fact, think and behave this way, though perhaps not in front of adults.  To support this, he produces a letter from a group of 12-13 year old prodigies.  A letter from 12-13 year olds hardly reinforces an argument that 6 year olds are as sophisticated as advanced adults.  In my opinion, Card could have added five years to the ages of all the children in the book and presented a far more realistic scenario.  Nevertheless, it is an excellent novel and well deserving of the accolades it has earned.ss, it is an excellent novel and well deserving of the accolades it has earned.
0618001905|4.0|Thoroughly researched, brilliantly crafted, brimming with drama and outsized personalities, this is history at its best.  Leopold is a fine dastardly villain, ED Morel a compelling hero (Henry Stanley, Sir Roger Casement, William Sheppard & others play lesser roles), but this is no simplistic morality play.  Hochschild fully develops the main characters, revealing both Leopold's range of motives and how Morel's shocked epiphany led him to pioneer secular humanitarianism.  The Congo reform movement saw the birth of modern concepts of human rights, divorced from the spiritual concerns of 19th-century abolitionism.  While the scandal led to Leopold's disgrace and 1908 Belgian takeover, atrocities declined due to rubber depletion more than principled protest.  There is one troubling issue: Westerners seem too interested in the seemingly endless Congo crises.  It's doubtlessly tragic, but we're rather too comfortable with Africa At Its Most Prostrate which confirms our worst prejudices.  It's no accident that the names above are Western: few Congolese appear in the book and mostly as victims.  African agency was scarce and sometimes wicked, but even in Leopold's Free State some made their own history.  Nevertheless, KLG deserves its reputation and resulting success.  4 1/2 stars for a work that satisfies on most levels.

Evie is so brave to go to St. Vincent after he just kidnapped one of her best friends.  Also the way St. Vincent tries so hard not to fall in love with Evie, but does any way.  This story is sweet and I loved it.
0156034026|3.0|The premise for the book and the way the story has been written is quite interesting and keeps one hooked. The attempt to delve into the psychology of why a complete \\"westernised\\" professional would turn back to Islam is encouraging.    However, I found the overall outcome to be a bit average. The attempt to explain the reasons for the protagonist's change of heart (and viewpoint) is without depth. For someone who does a complete turnaround and gives up what he has worked to achieve for most of his adult life, the thought process for doing so should have been detailed out much better.
1419551795|4.0|I used this book as a supplement to the official GMAT books, Kaplan course, and mba.com online tests. It gave me the extra practice I needed to master the tougher questions.     + Comprehensive. Covers each topic with a few questions/explanations on each topic.   + Organized by topic so you can skip to / focus on your primary areas of weakness  + Because of the way it was structured, I didn't need to sift through a lot of information to get to the questions that I was looking for.  + Excellent supplement to get extra practice on tough questions    - A few questions were repeats of the tougher questions in the online Kaplan GMAT course. But most of the questions were new to me after taking the Kaplan course.

B0008ENIAC|4.0|This gets high points for the fine acting, memorable characters and successful melding pf a film noir with a soap opera. The movie is very interesting all the way through but if stupid and/or annoying characters get to you, then don't bother with this because there are some big-time fools in this film who are guaranteed to raise your blood pressure!     There are six major characters in this film. Three people are totally despicable, one is nice and sensible, and two are somewhere in the middle.    Eve Arden, who provides the humor and common sense consistently. For those Baby Boomers who remember her as TV''s \\"Our Miss Brooks,\\" that's what she is here: same voice, same wise cracks.    Ann Blyth, the \\"Daughter from Hell,\\" plays one of the worst spoiled kids in the history of film.  Zachary Scott, ,as Mildred's second husband, a slimy, gold-bricking bum who has absolutely no morals.  Jack Carson is the way-too-horny slob and ruthless businessman/lawyer .     The lead character, Mildred Pierce, played by Joan Crawford, is a hard-working, good businesswomen and very devoted mother. Her bad characteristics include having absolutely no sense of judgment on how to raise kids or what a marriage is all about.  Finally, Bruce Bennett, as Mildred's first husband, has common sense regarding the kids, shows forgiveness and loyalty at the end, but cheats on his wife to begin with and walks out.    Yeah, as you can see above, it's soapy for a film noir......but it features interesting characters.  It's nice to see that the DVD sports s a beautiful transfer: a  sharp picture with good contrasts.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|I got the dvd in a quick manner which I expected they are in good shape as far as I can tell, I won't know for sure until I watch all 47 of them, but I expect they will be in good shape. The seller did a good job.
6305428352|4.0|This is simply a nice, dramatic story of a music teacher's life. Richard Dreyfuss plays the teacher, \\"Glenn Holland.\\" It spans 30 years of his career with a tear-jerking ending. Endearing characters make it a memorable film.    The focus of the story is Dreyfuss and three students he gives special time to over the years. A big subplot involves the teacher and his hearing-impaired son.    The students are winningly played by Alicia Witt, who plays the sweet girl who goes on to become governor; Terrence Howard, a really nice kid who gets killed in Viet Nam, and Jean Louisa Kelly, the last and most memorable student perhaps, an extremely talented singer who goes on to a career in New York City.    Interwoven are some personal stories, particularly with Kelly's character, and with fellow teachers (Jay Thomas playing the most likable) and school administrators (Olympia Dukakis and William H. Macy). The most personal, of course, involves his hot-cold-hot relationship with his disabled son (played by three different actors as time passes.) Glenne Headly, meanwhile, plays Dreyfuss' wife.    As you can see by this cast, this is a well-acted movie with the only flaw being the screenwriters unable - as Hollywood seems to be - to control their political bias by giving us unwarranted cheap shots to Republican politicians who are pictured as being against the arts. In addition, atheist John Lennon is almost deified in this film as one of the \\"heroes\\" of the 20th century, plus there are a few more digs and plugs here and there, all with the normal Liberal bias. Gee, why couldn't they just stick the story?    The movie seems to appeal to a wide audience. It's very manipulative, but it works. In addition to Hollywood's normal love affair of teachers, it is also a plug, if you will, for deaf children and the problems they face and the difficulties parents face in raising a kid with that disability.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I had been looking for this movie for some time. I was really glad to find it for such a good price.
B000WE660M|5.0|This version of Blackout I would purchase over the orignal. Although it has 4 extra songs this album is well worth the money. If you are a hardcore fan of Blackout I suggest you get this version. Britney Spears has always seem to be so put together in everyway including her music. With this album it seems that she is \\"being who she really wants to be\\". This was release at a very dark time in her life. But you know that the darkest and saddest times can bring out the best in an artist work.     Outta this World is a beautiful ballad simply lyrics and beautiful music.    Everybody is a cool song. The mixing of Annie Lennox's song was great. Cool idea of the producer.    Get back is the best song on this album in my opinion. It has cool lyrics and an even cooler beat.     Gimme More Remix is a genuinely cool remix. It is one of the best remixes of a song that is a Britney Spears song. Paul Oakenfold is great!     Buy the album.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I thought this movie was good. I've watched it more than once and that's always a good sign! The acting was good and the leading man is gorgeous to watch. Those British men really know how to stare longingly at someone. Anyone who is a fan of Austen or romantic movies will like this.

1416511946|5.0|This book offers excellent insight into the life a drug addict and a rockstar. Though most Motley Crue fans probably know that Nikki Sixx had problems with drugs, most probably didn't know the extent of his addiction and psychological problems he was dealing with at this time. This book is an excellent read--very easy to understand. Interviews with Nikki's friends, bandmates, etc. help the reader to understand the whole situation surrounding Nikki in 1987. Recommended to Motley Crue fans, music listeners, and any other person who just wants a good read.

015670160X|5.0|Orlando is adventure, comedy, gender study and literary commentary all rolled into one. The titular character lived through four centuries. During that time he served the Queen, fell in love with a Russian princess and lost her, entertained annoying guests, spent a century roaming in his estate, sailed out to exotic places where he became a she, and came back to find that her old love had grown fat.     A host of memorable characters populated the story, gifting it with eccentric moments: the pizza was toasted in the fireplace and the rug nearby was burned, the countess sneaked in the garden and \\"cackled and gaffled\\", and the sea captain was lured to chivalry by Orlando the lady's legs. The narrative is not as experimental as Woolf's earlier novels, but the prose is still intelligent and evocative. Woolf's laid-back style also makes the novel an easy, comforting read when you simply want some light entertainment.
B00005JPY2|3.0|In an alternate 1986, the US and Soviet Union are sliding towards war.  The Comedian (Morgan), a member of a disbanded group of superheroes called the Watchmen, is brutally murdered; setting events in motion that will change the world.  Rorschach (Haley), another member of the Watchmen, who happens to be a little unstable, sets out to find the killer.  He seeks the assistance of the rest of the team, Dr. Manhattan (Crudup), Silk Spectre (Ackerman), Ozymandias (Goode), and Night Owl (Wilson), to find the killer and is met with mixed reactions.  Still, he pushes onward, discovering a plan beyond his imagination .<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" is based on the vastly popular graphic novel by Dave Gibbons and an uncredited Alan Moore.  I have not read the source material, but have heard that the movie is very faithful to the comic with the exception of the ending.  The story is dense and complex and is not always easy to follow.  I don't think that is intentional, and that works against the film.  For the most part, the characters do not stand out.  The exception is Rorschach, amazingly played by Jackie Earle Haley.  He chews the scenery and simply steals every single scene he is in.  I would have loved to see more of him, but this is an ensemble film, so he is only one of many.  The film looks great.  Director Zach Snyder has a clear grasp of how to make a good looking movie.  In the end, fans of the book will be mostly pleased I think, but those unfamiliar with the work might be a bit put off.  This isn't a film for everyone, and I can only give it a marginally positive review.

B000001GXC|5.0|This is music to uplift us on a dull day. From the opening theme of 'The Hebrides' overture to the sparkling finale of the 'Italian' symphony, first to last tracks of the CD, Karajan and the BPO deliver a luminous performance that leaves us asking for more. Mendelssohn's brilliant scoring is brought out by the clarity of sound and smooth flow of the music. Strings, brass, and woodwinds are clearly defined; Karajan's feel for the music is helped by the fine balance provided by the sound engineers. The documentation praises \\"the inestimable acoustical advantage of Berlin's famous Jesus-Christus-Kirche\\" where the original analog recordings were made. Deutsche Grammophon's digital remastering has produced a CD fully worthy of its ORIGINALS label.<br /><br />The Hebrides overture runs for 10+ minutes and, placed first on the CD, whets the appetite for what's to come. Symphony No. 4 ('Italian') with its familiar themes is probably more popular than No. 3 ('Scottish'), but more popular does not mean better. The Scottish, at various times pensive or dramatic, vivid and melodic, is at least as good. One can't listen to these superb pieces without admiring Mendelssohn's inspired orchestration. During his lifetime, Mendelssohn earned high esteem as composer and conductor. Like Mozart and Schubert before him, his genius was cut short at an early age (39), but with recordings like this one available, his reputation lives on.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first purchased this DVD set well after the series had been cancelled. I was deployed to Iraq and was doing a search on Joss Whedon and this title came up. Unsure, but comfortable in my love of the rich universes, wonderful and often tongue in cheek dialogue, and very deep character creations and development, I ordered. And I am glad I did. This series quickly became my favorite series of all time, quickly supplanting even other Whedon fare.  The characters are more realistic than any other on either television or the big screen. Each character has their own agendas, whether it be as altruistic as Simon's desire to protect his sister at any cost, Kaylee's innocent desire to be noticed by Simon as more than a crew mate, or Jayne's selfish desire to improve his financial standing in life. Each character has a rich back story that Whedon did a delightful amount of time to build up to, a history that was as simple and well written as anything he ever wrote. Whedon's choice to utilize several actor's that he has used in the past was well made. Although I did find it humorous that three of the protagonists were antagonists in his prior casting of them.  Whedon's many decisions throughout the series, such as the decision to use no sound at all for any scenes in space, while rooted in some financial choices, all led to a wonderfully built universe, as human as any show ever filmed.  That Fox dictated that the series be aired out of order showed as much intelligence as Fox's cancelling of this show even prior to all the episodes having been aired. The uproar of all the fans, while it may not have led to the reinstating of the series, led to the green lighting of the movie Serenity, a wonderful if somber conclusion to this universe.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|I freely admit I had dangerously high expectations going into this film, having read SO many positive reviews (and some rabidly negative ones as well -- as this is one of those love-it-or-loathe-it experiences), but I'm happy to say that, for me, 'Martyrs' lived up to every bit of the hype, and then some.    The problem is that, for most people, they are simply NOT going to be anticipating what this film actually IS, as opposed to what they've been led to BELIEVE it is. Namely, though it contains many ASPECTS typical of the genre, 'Martyrs' is NOT really a \\"horror film\\" in the usual sense.    Don't get me wrong, though -- the film certainly IS horrifying at times, on a number of different levels. And it has a kind of nightmare poetry which continues to haunt me.    'Martyrs' also manages to convey an overwhelming sense of cumulative dread and a hellishly pervasive sense of cold, heartless, systematically calculating evil. But it actually has a lot more in common with Gaspar Noe's uncompromising 'Irreversible' and the dark lyricism of Franju's 'Eyes Without A Face' than it does with films like 'Saw' or 'Hostel'.    For, while it does have some extremely disturbing violence and gore, it's somewhat less extreme in that respect than either 'High Tension' or 'Inside' -- two other notable examples of the new wave of French horror cinema.    But 'Martyrs' affected me far more than any of the above-named films (excepting 'Irreversible' and 'Eyes...' ), because of the IDEAS being dealt with and because of Pascal Laugier's remarkably artful handling of his material, aided tremendously by the harrowing, raw-nerved excellence of the acting, as well as the superb cinematography, editing, music, and make-up effects.    Indeed, 'Martyrs' is an \\"art film\\" in many ways. In fact, at a couple points it actually elicited tears from me -- not my typical response to most horror films -- as well as a few genuinely appalled exclamations of \\"Oh my God... Oh my God...\\", such was the level ofmy empathy and identification with the main characters and their ordeal.    In fact, it was this aspect of the film which enabled me to get past what would otherwise have been a big stumbling block for me, in terms of conventional movie logic -- i.e. the critical caveat of illogical behavior on the part of the characters when faced with a dangerous or potentially dangerous situation and NOT getting the hell OUT of there! In fact, at a very key point in the narrative, not only do the two main characters refuse to extricate themselves from a very risky and potentially dangerous locale, they positively LINGER there for what seems like DAYS!    Now, normally this would have had me crazy and screaming in frustration at the seeming stupidity or obtuseness of the characters. But, miraculously, in the case of 'Martyrs' I hardly even registered any of this because of the particular relationship dynamic of Lucie and Anna and their unique personal/psychological histories. In other words, given the very particular qualities of these two women, a specific case could be made for what would otherwise have seemed infuriatingly inappropriate behavior.    I find it both apt and reassuring that Laugier has referred to his film as the \\"anti-'Funny Games'\\", referencing Michael Haneke's deeply unpleasant, repellently grueling exercise in audience participation/endurance. For while 'Funny Games' was also not a horror film in the exploitative/commercial sense, neither did it have, for me, the inherent spiritual aspects or, dare I say, compassion, which make me willing to return to 'Martyrs', whereas I never feel myself eager to play more 'Funny Games'.    But, more than anything, 'Martyrs' lingers in my mind as a deeply sad, disturbing, and ultimately moving meditation on the theme of pain and transcendence. And though I can see many viewers recoiling from the experience, disgusted by its brutal savagery and depressed and offended by its seeming nihilism (with the emphasis on \\"seeming\\"),I find that the film's intriguing ambiguities and moral questions make for a rich cinematic tapestry, reflective of both heaven and hell. And yet, paradoxically, it is perhaps the film's unnerving ability to convey a world of bottomless evil and merciless cruelty that kept me from giving 'Martyrs' a full five stars. Almost as though a part of me would feel guilty in doing this -- as if that would be akin to giving my implicit endorsement or tacit approval of the film's pitch-black heart of darkness.    Perhaps, Mr. Laugier, you did your job a bit TOO well!    Be that as it may, clearly this film has a lot more on its mind than simply grossing out or traumatizing its audiences, though it certainly managed that, as well, during some of its controversial festival screenings. Yet I would still hesitate to recommend it to most people I know. 'Martyrs' is, decidedly and emphatically, NOT a film for everyone.    But, for those looking to be challenged as well as shaken -- for those willing to be taken to deeply uncomfortable places and shown terrible things in new and unexpected ways -- for those yearning to FEEL a visceral response again after years of mindless, numbing \\"movie-violence\\"... For all these people 'Martyrs' will be a welcome, if not necessarily pleasant experience, leaving them with something to actually THINK about once the end credits have rolled.    A very sad postscript to a very sad film:    Benoit Lestang, a close friend of the director, and the man who contributed the film's jaw-droppingly powerful special make-up effects, committed suicide shortly after the film's completion. He did get to see the film prior to his death and apparently was proud of his work and moved to tears by the film. As to the specific reasons for his tragic decision, little has been spoken or written about that. And, given the film's specific subject matter, one could all too easily be drawn into the temptation of making inappropriate connections and drawing conclusions, which Ishall assiduously avoid.    Laugier himself has been very candid about his own personal feelings, both in regard to the emotional devastation of losing his friend, as well as the fact that the creative genesis of 'Martyrs' sprang from a long period of Laugier's own depression. And he has indicated that, in some ways, the film was perhaps his response to that depression -- partially expiating it through channeling his own darkness and pain into that of the film's theme and characters.    Suffice it to say, 'Martyrs' will provide a lasting and worthy final monument to Mr. Lestang's extraordinary gifts as a supremely talented artist and craftsman. And it is precisely that artistry, in conjunction with that of Laugier and the rest of his remarkable team, that resulted in startling images of strange and terrible beauty. Images which, like the film itself, continue to linger in the mind long after the final curtain.    Peace be with you, Benoit.

B001QWBM62|5.0|Among the many other recorders on the market today, I looked seriously at the H2 and the original H4. I ended up not buying anything for awhile because every single one of these devices seemed to be missing something or have a negative aspect that I just wasn't enthusiastic about paying for. Then I heard some rumbling that Zoom was coming out with the H4n, which was supposed to be their response to all the feedback they'd gotten about the H2 & H4. So after all the good things I'd read about those two, the H4n had me at hello. I grabbed one as soon as it became available, which was about a month after they announced it. (Serial # 1438!)    I won't review every little detail of the H4n but I'll tell you the three major improvements that made me buy this:    - The screen is now a healthy size and displays everything you need to know clearly.     - The interface overall is a pleasure to use. You can operate it easily with one hand. It's very intuitive and all the controls feel solid. I usually go through the manual once anytime I get a new piece, but for basic recording you really wouldn't have to. Even the 4-track mode is a breeze.    - Zoom has really stepped up the build quality on this piece. Unlike its all-plastic predecessors, the H4n's case is rubberized and the mics are solidly mounted on... what's this, metal? It has a nice solid weight and feels pro. One thing I didn't understand though: the original H4 had these protective pieces surrounding the mics and the H4n does not. But it's slightly top-heavy and if dropped I can easily imagine the mics hitting the floor first and I'm pretty sure they would be tweaked/broken. Or what if you had this in your back pocket and sat on the mics? It's like, for all the work they put into making this more durable, they left the most important part vulnerable. Which kind of makes me wonder whether the extra heft of this unit is just for feel, not for real. (Time will tell..)    I will primarily be using this to record DJ sets and sounds from the field. I did that this past weekend and the quality is just as good as the other reviews say it is. I'm looking forward to being able to record a stereo mix from the mixer, simultaneous with a room mix with crowd noise, in 4 channel mode. Also this is the first condenser I've owned and I look forward to using it in the studio. I leave some cables hanging off the back of the cable box so if I hear something on TV I can just plug in and hit record. I thought I wouldn't use the 4-track but already it has me exploring ideas in the car. The built-in speaker is really handy. The FX are very high quality and there are some interesting ones beyond the typical reverb and delay.    The H4n is like the Swiss Army Knife of field recorders. The big one, with all the weird blades and tools you'll probably never need. It's one of those rare moments of technical glory when a company collects a ton of great ideas from their customers, refuses to compromise, and you end up with a truly inspired product.

I think this is an excellent tool for any writer, whether you're published or not. In this book I realized the very nature of writing often isolates us from the outside world; and from making contact with kindred souls who understand the writing life all the more important.<br /><br />In \\"On Writing\\" King teaches you everything on writing: both, growth and progress on how to deliverer a powerful story with a strong original plot, showing vs. telling, creating strong dialogue, character development and so much more.<br /><br />It's a little slow, well very slow, in the beginning, where he takes you all throughout his childhood to his battles with alcohol and drug addiction. It's not a memoir; it's just telling how he was created for writing.<br /><br />For a person like me who enjoys reading all genres, (including works from authors like Stephen King himself, Alice Walker, Zane, Donald Goines, Jackie Collins, Noire, Toni Morrison, Eric Jerome Dickey, K'wan, Kimberla Lawson Roby, Walter Mosley, Donna Hill, Tracy Brown, R.M Johnson, and T. Styles just to name a few.  Okay, I know that was a lot, but the list only goes on:) I now have a better understanding of why I'm attracted to reading from people who's telling totally different stories, in totally different genres. If not reading this book I would have never understood that. It's not the genre, its story and how it is shaped to capture me into reading it.<br /><br />In this book, what I am now calling a \\"writing tool\\" Stephen actually takes you on a tour of his mind. I found the secrets he shared very interesting about how he writes and edit his work. (I don't know how true it is, but I heard that he doesn't let any editor go near his work.)<br /><br />If you're a writer or aspiring writer this book is a perfect one stop solution for you. I suggest before enrolling in a creative or fiction writing class read this book first. Although the beginning is kind of slow, once it gets to the actual \\"On Writing\\" part I guarantee you'll find yourself amazed. King walks you through everything you need to know about writing in a very straight forward direct way.<br /><br />Again, if you're an inspiring writer and trying to pen a manuscript, or even finished with your manuscript, I suggest this book to you before you start shopping your work around.<br /><br />Also, I just want to share, my English professor recommended I read \\"Bird by Bird\\" by Anne Lamott next. She says it's just as good as this book.ring writer this book is a perfect one stop solution for you. I suggest before enrolling in a creative or fiction writing class read this book first.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|\\"Man on Wire\\" is a documentary about Philippe Petit's dream to tightrope walk between the two towers of the World Trade Center in NY.  What easily could have been a average 30 minute film is instead a riveting documentary that deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Documentary.<br /><br />Having a fear of heights, there were pictures and video of Petit's exploits that were absolutely harrowing.  The story of how Petit and his helpers were able to get all their equipment in place and their ingenuity in stringing a steel wire between the two towers is unbelievable.  The historical footage of the WTC and surrounding area along with Petit's walk are worth watching.  However, when you put that together with the story of how they could accomplish this feat -- all the little things that had to and did go right -- and the interviews with key players, you have a brilliant picture.<br /><br />The only thing about the movie that left a bad taste in my mouth was Philippe Petit.  He's a pompous, arrogant person and it is a good thing his exploits are so interesting because he is not a very endearing person.

B0001CNRBG|5.0|I, for one, was a skeptic.  I loved Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce on M*A*S*H and was hesitant to see him in anything else.  After viewing it just once, this has become one of my favorite romantic comedies of all time.    Alda plays George, a happily married accountant with kids.  He meets Doris (Ellen Burstyn), a happily married homemaker, at a California inn in 1951.  Neither one is the straying kind.  They eat dinner at separate tables and, somehow, look up at the right moment and catch the other's eye.  It is, for them, an immediate attraction that they easily give into.  Afterward, both feel guilty about the adultery ... though neither truly regrets what happened.  It is in this first interlude that they start a tradition -- they share one good thing and one bad thing about their spouses.  It is a great ice-breaker.    We see these two at different points in their lives as they continue the affair each year -- same time, same place.  We see them experience angst, joy, and grief together.  They come alive with each other, soothe each other, and balance each other.  George and Doris love their spouses, but have a deep and abiding love for each other.  As the years go by, they age ... but their love grows with them.  In 1977, George arrives at their meeting place with news, and an important question that Doris has waited decades for.  I couldn't help but root for them -- the acting is that good.    Kudos to Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn for a great romantic comedy!

0307269752|5.0|Rarely does 644 pages go by so quickly!  Lisbeth Salander is simply fascinating and I can't wait to read more about her.  The plot has been detailed in many wonderful reviews here, so there really isn't much more to add there.  This book kept me up late on more than one occasion and waiting for the 2nd in the series, The Girl who Played with Fire, is agonizing.
0525951113|5.0|Daemon is an exceptional cyber thriller that feels authentic and plausible despite the astonishing sequence of events that transpire. I am constantly seeking books that speculate about the near future and this novel succeeds in taking trends of MMORP and citizens detachment from reality and fascination/dependence on technology and computers and projects an all too real scenario. I suspect the author did not intend to make analogies to the current economic global meltdown and the consequences of this sequence of events but whether intended or not this book stimulates some insights. Oh yeah, it's a lot of fun as well and you will have a very difficult time putting it down.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|\\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" is a wonderfully staged fantasy based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's fantasy about a boy born old and aging younger instead of older. The story could obviously be off-putting and distracting, but everyone involved does such a magnificent job of telling this story that it is not hard to accept this as fact, and following the story as it shows Benjamin growing younger and falling in love with a young girl named Daisy.<br /><br />Benjamin and Daisy's story and the balance of Benjamin's life impart so many valuable life lessons that it is hard to recount them all - the idea that life brings many hardships and the best we can do is doing the best we can with what we're given, making the most of every moment because life is fleeting and unpredictable, find the joy and happinessin life and hold on to it dearly, and many other lessons.<br /><br />\\"Benjamin Button\\" gives Brad Pitt the chance to shine in the title role, and he makes the most of it. He is ably assisted by Cate Blanchett as Daisy, Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's adoptive mother, Tilda Swinton as another love of Benjamin's, and many others. This film is marvelous and a hopeful fable for all of us.
0786838655|5.0|Hi, I am a 10 year old reader who loved the book Lightning Thief. The Lightning Thief is a great book for young readers like me. I think I am a pretty good reader and think that other readers that are action lovers will love this book. This book has loads of action, Greek mythology, and emotion. What really pulled me in (in either Chapter 2 or 3) is when Percy Jackson fought the Minotaur because I realized it had action. At first I didn't want to read it because it had 375 pages, but when I tried it I realized that it was worthwhile. I personally liked this one more than Artemis Fowl, by Eoin Colfer, and The Book of Three, by Lloyd Alexander, because it got into the action a lot faster than others. This book is great for 10 year olds like me.    This book is about a sixth grader named Percy Jackson who doesn't know what adventure he is going to get into. He finds out that he will encounter monsters during a quest for the Gods. When he sets out for his quest, he takes two friends with him.  The Oracle tells him that he will get betrayed by someone that he calls a friend.  Do you know who betrays him? Read the book to find out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I highly recommend that all kids my age read this book.  I'm already on Book Two: The Sea of Monsters, and I love that one too.  Only time will tell if I like it as much as The Lightning Thief!   P.S. it sometimes talks about cursing in other languages, so make sure you know that you are O.K. with that.

B001KL3GWM|5.0|With Already Free, the Derek Trucks Band continues to ensure its place as one of the best bands of the rock era. As with all great artists, Trucks is reluctant to repeat himself or rest at a musical plane most musicians would kill to reach. Derek strives to stretch and grow as a musician and bandleader. Creating a solid platform for his voice-like guitar solos is a terrific, very tight group of musicians. The songs on this CD are varied in style but all have emotional depth that repeated listening reveal. People, this is stunning, well thought out music. The DTB is certainly one of the best bands which leads to this statement: Derek Trucks will prove to be not only the best guitarist of his generation, but also, among the three best guitarists of the rock era.
B00005JPY2|3.0|First, I should start by announcing that I have never read the very popular graphic novel \\"Watchmen', the source for the new film directed by Zach Snyder (\\"300\\"). I'm not sure that makes a difference, but I know there are a lot of ardent admirers out there and I hope these same admirers will read this review with an open mind. If not an open mind, at least with the ability to recognize the fact that others may not like the film as much as the diehard fans of the graphic novel probably do.<br /><br />In the 1940s, the Minutemen form together to become a force of superheroes, prepared to help people in their time of need. Among this group are the Night Owl, Silk Specter (Carla Gugino), the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) who is involved in an accident at his lab and becomes Dr. Manhattan. The Minutemen are a ragtag group who wear hand-sewn costumes and basically fight villains with their bare hands. They are treated as heroes and this status seems to affect many of them in the wrong way. As time passes, some of these folks retire, others continue working for the government and some new folks join the group. Flash forward to \\"Present Day\\". It is 1985. Nixon is still in the White House and superheroes have been banned after one too many protests. So, the current Watchmen, Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman), Silk Spectre's daughter has taken over the reigns and now becomes Silk Spectre II, Night Owl II is now Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson). Rohrshack (Jackie Earle Haley) and Ozymandias, who's alter ego Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) is an industrialist, have gone, more or less, undercover. The US and Russia appear to be getting closer and closer to a nuclear war, promising certain annihilation. In fact, this possibility leads Dr. Manhattan to exile because his ability to see the future doesn't paint a good image for him. When the Comedian is murdered, the group reunites, in a fashion, and begins to investigate his murder, leading them to some surprising revelations.<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" as an idea is better than \\"Watchmen\\" as a film. From the moment I first saw trailers about this film, I was intrigued and gradually became more excited as the release date approached and I became aware of how many ardent fans there are of the graphic novel. Basically, a story about superheroes, these characters come from more real places, have more human emotions and problems, and get into more violent situations. In short, a more adult superhero experience. Great. Sign me up.<br /><br />Zach Snyder, the 'visionary' (as the trailers and commercials for the film proclaim) director who created \\"300\\" is probably the right choice to bring this highly visual universe to reality. The Watchmen inhabit a sort of alternative universe. Nixon is still the President, enjoying his fifth term in office because he is so popular. We won the Vietnam War, thanks in large part to the members of the Watchmen (The Comedian and Dr. Manhattan are shown in combat). So things are different in this world. And everything appears real. Yet, it also has that comic book sort of appearance. Especially when some of the characters become their alter egos. Dan Dreiberg could be an extrapolation of Clark Kent. Snyder seems to have an innate sense of how to show us everything we need while filling in all of the extra space with unique and interesting details.<br /><br />But Snyder doesn't seem to have as good a handle on both narrative and character development.<br /><br />From what I understand, Snyder adheres pretty closely to the source material, so perhaps this is a criticism that should be addressed to Alan Moore and the other folks behind the graphic novel. But as director, Snyder is ultimately responsible for all elements of the finished film and can make (and should have made?) changes to the story to strengthen it. I suppose if he had changed the story too much, he would have heard about it from the legions of fans, so he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.<br /><br />Yes, these characters are more human and more adult than many superheroes. And some of this works. For instance, a burgeoning relationship between Silk Spectre II and Night Owl II (Malin Ackerman and Patrick Wilson) leads to a believable place in this relationship, attributing some real moments to the film's R rating. But because they are also more human and more adult, they are not necessarily squeaky-clean characters. Or in some cases, even likable. Is it necessary to like a superhero? I kind of think it is. If you don't like a superhero, can you root for him to win a battle against the 'villain'? And in \\"Watchmen\\", it gets even more complicated than that. Is there a villain? A true villain who is working for a bad end? That is, at best, debatable.<br /><br />Yes, Snyder seems to have fun creating certain environments for the characters. But he has already shown he can do this with the interesting and very visual \\"300\\", which was an unexpected and very good film. In \\"Watchmen\\" he creates dingy, grimy cities circa mid 40s and mid 80s. He also creates more than a few superhero-type fortresses and shows us the interior of a vehicle used by the new crew of the Watchmen. It is an interesting film visually. Because the film presents an alternate history of our country from a certain point, everything looks similar, but these similar items also look a little surreal. Grimy things are grimier, sexy people are sexier, beautiful things are more beautiful. This aspect of the film is accomplished in spades.<br /><br />Snyder takes these moments of realism to an extreme. As the Watchmen battle various bad guys, using their fists and karate kicks, we see bones break and blood spurt. This is an interesting addition, and helps to make the story seem more adult. But Snyder also seems to linger more on the broken leg, for example. When the leg breaks, his camera slows down and lingers briefly on the broken limb, highlighting this moment of it. It is brief, but because he pauses and accentuates the action, it is all the more memorable. And maybe even disturbing.<br /><br />\\"Visionary director Zach Snyder\\"? Something about the Warner Bros. publicity department labeling the director of their own film as \\"visionary\\" rubs me the wrong way. Snyder may very well be a great new talent, but visionary? This is a label that should be bestowed after years of great films. As a marketing tool it just seems desperate.<br /><br />The actors are serviceable if unremarkable in their various roles. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jackie Earle Haley are certainly the best of the bunch, as they each play the most complicated characters. Morgan (TV's \\"Grey's Anatomy\\") plays the Comedian, a super hero who seems to enjoy many vices, smoking, booze, killing, and only occasionally tries to do the right thing. Having been around the longest, he also has the opportunity to become the most interesting. He has seen many things in his life as a superhero, both good and bad, and it isn't completely clear how these have affected him.<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley (\\"Little Children\\", \\"Breaking Away\\") plays Rohrshack, a member of the Watchmen who has difficulty controlling his anger. When the Comedian is murdered, he leads the rest of the Watchmen in the investigation, propelling them into the rest of the story. He is also the most aggressive, hiding his real features behind a mask (that looks like the same thing Scarecrow wore in \\"Batman Returns\\") covered with ever changing ink blots, he attacks most people with the slightest provocation. And he doesn't stop until he makes sure the deed is done.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson (\\"Little Children\\") plays Dan Dreiberg whose alter ego Night Owl II seems to be the moral compass of the group. As Dreiberg, he looks like Clark Kent, complete with thick-rimmed glasses and nerdish looks. As Night Owl, we learn he inherited a lot of money allowing him to set up the headquarters for the Watchmen. There is a very good scenewhen he and Silk Spectre, as their alter egos, are confronted by a large group of hoodlums. Against seemingly invincible odds, they quickly dispatch the group.<br /><br />Malin Ackerman plays Silk Spectre II and is the daughter of Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino), who now spends all her time in a booze-shrouded mist. Ackerman is certainly very pretty, but she is kind of boring as an actress. Every time she appears on screen, her facial expression seems to be the same. She is interested in both Dr. Manhattan and Night Owl and both are interested in her. She also uncovers a dark secret about her past and confronts her mother with the truth.<br /><br />Billy Crudup, an actor I usually greatly admire and enjoy, plays Dr. Manhattan. Manhattan, a former scientist who gets caught in one of his experiments, gains a power allowing him to control all of the molecules in his body. This same experiment turns him blue. And seems to rob him of the need to wear clothes. It is more than a little disconcerting to see a computer-generated character designed to look like an outstanding body builder. And to see this man walking around naked, with his blue testicles hanging out for most of the film. I think the idea is that Dr. Manhattan's accident has caused him to reach a new level of power and enlightenment. He doesn't need to live on Earth. And doesn't appear to like to live on Earth. And wonders why he should try to save a planet he no longer has any ties to. During a conversation with Silk Spectre, he takes her to Mars so they can converse more freely. Of course, she has difficulty breathing and he quickly creates a safe building for her. But why go to Mars in the first place? There are a lot of questions left unanswered in \\"Watchmen\\".<br /><br />And I don't get some of the alternative reality references. For instance, why is Nixon still in office in 1985? A co-worker tried to tell me that this made him more of a monarch than a President, and this is what gave him so much power. But these points of argument must come from the graphic novel, because they certainly aren't explored in the film.

0385340567|2.0|After 11 great books, Lee Child had to show his political views thru a non-political character- Jack Reacher.  Jack Reacher, former MP Major, being sympathetic to AWOL soldiers from an ongoing war?  No way buddy, you are way off base, stop drinking the kool-aid and come back to reality.  It would be akin to Jack Bower being sympathetic to  muslim 'freedom fighters' in Iraq.  Give me a break Lee.  Take your politics elsewhere, I won't be buying No. 13.
B00000AFFI|5.0|In my top ten albums of all time, this disc is beautiful, haunting, and disconcerting all at once.  The bonus disc (Elise single and presumably four b-sides) is also among PJs best work - somewhat sparse but still melodic, the tracks make an excellent pairing with the LP.  The chilling \\"Sweeter Than Anything\\" is worth the price alone.
045122499X|5.0|...you'll like World Without End. It's great. I won't summarize, you can look at the synopsis for that, but I will tell you that I loved it.    All of the same tools and devices (literary) are here, and it's very similar to Pillars in many regards, but don't let that deter you.    The \\"Pillars\\" in the first book...the very human characters...were what made it so good, and there is much more of that kind of character development in this \\"sequel\\". You'll love, loathe, laugh, cry, sympathize, justify, and pretty much live in the lives of these characters. Some of them might be better written than in Pillars.    In World Without End, the sun rises and sets, people are born, people die, some are good, some are evil, and some are just human, but the World keeps turning.     I'm a fan of any great fiction, from fantasy and horror, to mysteries, thrillers, and historical fiction. If you love a book that you don't want to finish because the journey is so good, buy this book.
031606792X|1.0|The 4th book to the Twilight Saga is an absolute shame.  I rate the first book 4 stars, with each book going down one star.  This last book, the 4th book, is just a crying shame.  My friends and I all agreed: this book should not have been written.  It's messy, wandering, wavers from the storytelling from the other three books, and is a downright disappointment. The grammar is sloppy and there were whole chapters that seemed to have no point (many of friends said they just skipped through them).  I wish I had stopped after the 3rd book (also somewhat of a disappointment for me).  In all truth, I would have been happy to read just the first book.  Without giving away spoilers like some reviews might... I will just say that this 4th book was a cop-out for the author and an insult to a devoted fanbase.  I won't read any more of her books.  Do yourself a favor and SKIP THIS.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|As I've been reading through these reviews, it seems that the hardcore fans of Chris Cornell, and his various projects, are taken back by his new approach to music.  I admit, being a fan of his (admittedly not a 'hardcore' fan), I can completely understand how this album might feel like a slap in the face to his long time fan base.  However, I believe if you can get passed Chris' previous records, and approach this project from a different perspective, you might enjoy this release.  The production by Timbaland (along with his co-production team) and the mixing done by 'Demo' are extremely clean and, unlike a lot of releases lately, not overly compressed/distorted (why did producers/engineers think overly compressing every sound would be a good idea?).  Chris' vocals sound phenomenal as well as Timbaland and his engineer have a knack for recording vocals and bringing out a great performance from an artist.  I'm not going to review each track individually; however, I do want to touch on a few key tracks.  The track that everyone I'm sure has heard by now is \\"Scream\\".  It's a great song and very atmospheric.  One issue I have with this song is the drum pattern courtesy of Timbaland.  I think he has really started to over-use this pattern (I'm referring to the percussion).  Listen to \\"Apologize\\" by OneRepublic and you will hear the similarities.  Even though the sound is over-used, it does work in the overall production here.  \\"Other Side of Town\\" is another incredible track and the melodies are just moving.  I also like that the snare drum takes center stage in this song as opposed to the kick drum, really adds to the feel of the track.  The last song I want to mention is the hidden song.  This one steers away from the pop/synth sound of the previous 13 songs and is more blues/rock oriented.  It's a great song, but I can see why they chose to make it a hidden track as it really doesn't fit into the overall feel of the album.  Speaking of the album having an overall feel, each track blends seamlessly into the next, with no \\"dead air\\" between songs.  I personally love this.  The album feels like a complete body of work as opposed to a bunch of songs on a CD.  If you stay open minded, you just might enjoy this one.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|Man over 150 reviews and the movie was just released today to blu-ray/dvd. I picked this up this morning and finished watching earlier today...I saw it at the movie theater and now blu-ray.  I enjoyed it much more on blu-ray.  The action sequences were much more easier to watch and keep up with as was the dialogue(audio).<br /><br />For people who say there was no plot...there were multiple story lines and setups for future Bond movies. I agree the major villian was not all that scary/bad but in my opinion this movie was more about the development of Bond, which I think it accomplished....for people who have said the bond girl for this movie was not sexy or compelling, I guess you all date a super model(lol).<br /><br />I would suggest people who wrote negative reviews on here going back to January actually rent the movie in dvd or blu-ray then re-examine their reviews.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|While this adaptation of the book on film may vary a bit more from the book than the 1995 version of P&P, one can't help but agree that this version is an absolutely stunning film based on Austen's most loved book. I love both the movies and the book and believe that all three of them have something different and unique to offer. This one, I believe, displays so much of the beauty and warmth of the time period and Austen's characters. I loved it and at such a great price on Amazon...it's a steal you just can't resist. :) I hope others who are skeptical will give it a chance! You'd be missing out. :)
1416914307|3.0|The Mortal Instruments series is consistently written well enough while the history and story being told is rich, enchanting and satisfying for any fan of YA fantasy.  In the last book of the series, City of Glass, following Clary, Jace, and Simon to face their own dangers and problems is exciting and their growth as characters and teenagers is believable.    However, I have to say that overall, it made me extremely uncomfortable.    (Beware SPOILERS below!)    Clary and Jace get close physically and it was crossing the line into incest.  Something the series toes the line of regularly but in this book has fully crossed into.  Regardless of how I felt about whether or not Clary and Jace were siblings, throughout the three books the reader is continually told that these two characters ARE related.  I really think the any scene with sexual contact should have waited until the truth was established. I still can't enjoy it, even now, knowing the truth.    Also, the Sebastian/Clary relationship had a sickening after-taste. I understand we need to realize how truly damaged he is but I believe it was poorly executed.  There are other ways to portray how dangerous, deranged and flawed a character is without falling back on sex.    I love, love, LOVE the story and City of Bones remains one of my favorite books to date.  It's so very unique (aside from a Star Wars-ish link) and well-written but the brother/sister incest eclipses the overall storytelling which to me is sad and a terrible waste of what could have potentially been an amazing mythology.

B001N18HO6|5.0|Pearl Jam has surpassed the competition with this Super Deluxe Edition of the Ten reissue. Though the cost may appear to be restrictive, and to some in this economy--insulting, note that the band has put everything into this box. A lot of bands today are releasing increasingly-priced deluxe editions of varying widths and lengths, but this set feels the worth. They clearly put every bit of their respect for the long-time fans into this box set.     The cloth-bound box is rather heavy and is the shape of a vinyl record. The slip box that pulls out of it contains everything except the vinyl records. In that is an envelope that includes reproductions of Pearl Jam memorabilia including postcards, a Mookie Blaylock playing card, concert ticket, sticker, etc. Additionally there are card-stock quality photos, all of which contain the box's liner notes/credits on the back (for the set, the concert, the original album and the remix).    Underneath a composition book is fastened into the box. The book, designed to perfection by Jeff Ament and Eddie Vedder, is exactly what a Pearl Jam would expect to see. It includes notes, doodles, designs and memorabilia seemingly fastened onto the page (though every page is actually just a flattened reproduction). The book is exhaustive with memorabilia, including backstage passes, newspaper clippings, pictures of the actual Mookie Blaylock. The box also contains a full sized poster of the album cover. It's a visual history of 1990 to 1992, a peak into the band's unique design sense, thanks in large part to Ament's meticulous craft. (As a designer, I took special appreciation in seeing the sketches of t-shirt designs or posters with notes about font styles and sizes). The band eschewed the self-serving biographical liner notes that typically champion a band in these box sets, keeping to their reluctant and humble image. If you're buying this box set, you probably already know the stories.     Underneath the book, are the sleeve for the CDs/DVD and the reproduction of the infamous Momma-Son cassette tape that brought Eddie Vedder to Stone Gossard's attention. The demo includes Vedder's vocals for Alive, Once and Footsteps over Gossard's music demo (with help from future drummer Matt Cameron). The demo is of the quality you would expect of the time, but is a fascinating peak into the band's formation. (Especially hearing Vedder's spot-on vocals prior to ever meeting any of his future bandmates.)     The first CD is a remaster of the classic Ten (which doesn't need to be reviewed here). The second CD is a Brendan O'Brien remix of the album, along with six bonus tracks. The remix doesn't mess with the essential basics but crisps up the original mix and improves the production value of the recording. (Whether a fan wants to remain completely loyal to the original mix is unessential since both versions are included.) The bonus tracks include rough mixes of two favorites from the Singles soundtrack (\\"Breath\\" and \\"State of Love and Trust\\") along with four other notable additions...all in the spirit of the first album's delivery. Additionally, a DVD captures the full unedited set from Pearl Jam's famous appearance on MTV Unplugged from 1992, a nice preview to the band's increasing skillful dabblings in acoustic-performed rock in later albums.      Vinyl productions of both Ten and the Ten redux are included along with a double-vinyl of Drop in the Park, a famous concert Pearl Jam performed in Seattle. (The latter has been mixed by O'Brien.) It's a gripping peak at Pearl Jam in their raw infancy...tearing through their early tracks with the same reckless abandon of Vedder climbing the scaffolding. (The Drop in the Park vinyl includes a poster fold-out for the show.)     Pearl Jam have outdone most bands with a perfectly themed, honest-to-their-roots set celebrating their much-heralded debut. And like they did back in 1991 they are now forcing other bands to get real and give their fans what they want: more bangfor our buck. SPECIAL NOTE: In all of the literature in the box, the set is called \\"Pearl Jam 1990-1992\\" which follows up on the rumblings that the band plans to do the same with much of their back catalog.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|first off, the people that gave this crappy album 5 stars saying it was a return to 'metallica's original roots' are probably the same people that watch that pathetic  so called metal show, 'that metal show' or whatever its called. where 'random audience members' ask the 'true metal fan' eddie trunk (lol)who made a guest vocal appearance on cindarella's first album or whatever??!!     back to review, sorry, even if this had a death metal producer, it would still be not metal. this sounds nothing like metallica of old, maybe and i mean maybe, the last song has glimmers of the old stuff. james' voice is shot, the guitars are way too clean sounding and the drums are not heavy at all.   'justice for all' is probably their most heaviest and technical album. they should of stopped recording after that album instead of purposely making us wait for crappy new albums!!!!  their old stuff was heavier because they still had punk and hardcore elements in their music. that's gone now, but they are getting older and richer and punk and thrash is a young man's game after all.
B00003CWL6|4.0|American Beauty (1999) Lester and Carolyn Burnham seem to have it all: a nice house, two well-paid jobs, a couple of expensive cars, and a beautiful daughter. But as is so often true in these modern times, a lot of dysfunction hides behind the mask of happy normalcy.<br />  In truth, Lester (Kevin Spacey) is going middle age crazy, pining for his carefree youth and making goo-goo eyes at his daughter's Lolita-like best friend. Carolyn (Annette Bening) has discovered that \\"having it all\\" isn't nearly enough; she throws herself into her real estate job to try to compensate. And the daughter is going through that economy sized variety pack of teen angst, ranging from insecurity to parent loathing. Add in a set of new next door neighbors with their own problems (Dad's a bigoted ex-Marine; Mom's a zoned out space case, and son is a fairly creepy video voyeur); stir them all together well, and you have the perfect recipe for suburban disaster.<br />  Director Sam Mendes, writer Alan Bell, and especially the actors make the most of this dramatic black comedy. The mix is perfectly realized, with laugh out loud scenes that nonetheless have a sense of tragedy and doom about them.<br />  Writer Ball has a background in sitcoms, so it's no surprise that ther is a lot of sharp tongued verbal byplay. More surprising is how well a thirty-four year old director can guide his actors through the minefield of fortysomething neuroses. But then, you don't hire actors like Spacey and Bening because they'll do a mean karaoke at the wrap party. Spacey is as excellent as he is expected to be, and he is matched scene for scene by the slightly underrated Bening. The rest of the cast lend fine support, with newcomer Wes Bentley standing out.<br />  This is a quirky, somewhat unusual film, with a few stylized fantasy scenes that add to the flavor overall. If you enjoy such productions, this is definitely a good choice to sink your teeth into. Also with Peter Gallagher (Summer Lovers) and Chris Cooper (Lone Star).(Lone Star).
0375707972|2.0|I found this book to be like an English assignment. It didn't flow from section to section and the characters felt undeveloped. I was disappointed when part one simply ended with Hannah going away. The trial section was equally as blunt. I never felt anything for the main characters.  I would not recommend this book to a friend because it didn't seem like a finished product.
B0007M22TI|5.0|This is an awesome DVD!  We have had no trouble with it whatever; and the material is mesmerizing,  The beauty of the music and the beauty of the performers complement each other wonderfully -- we love this DVD!
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Before I get to my review, let me give the run-down of what this DVD set has to offer, according to KryptonSite. The Blu-Ray version may differ.    For starters, the current release date is August 25, 2009.    It'll include all 22 episodes from Smallville's eighth season, as well as the following features: cast & creator commentaries (including Geoff Johns for \\"Legion\\"), unaired scenes, a featurette titled \\"Smallville's Doomsday: The Making of a Monster,\\" and another featurette called \\"In the Director's Chair: Behind the Scenes and Calling the Shots with Allison Mack.\\"    Awesome features for an awesome season.    Now, on to my review...    I've been a fan of the show since day one, but I wasn't expecting much from Season 8.    This time around, Lex and Lana aren't recurring characters. Also, the original producers didn't return. To say the least, I was fearful.    To my pleasant surprise, however, Smallville's eighth season has become my favorite yet. It's darker. It's edgier. Finally, Clark is making the transition from farmboy to superhero.    Don't get me wrong. This season has its missteps, like any other in Smallville's history. But I'd say that, overall, this has been the most entertaining season yet. Here's why...    - Clark is more heroic than ever  - Chloe gets some spotlight for a change  - The Lois and Clark relationship begins to blossom  - Some loose ends are tied (Lex, Lana, Kara)  - More input from the Justice League  - The introduction of Tess Mercer, a worthy replacement for Lex  - Sam Witwer as Doomsday    And let me repeat that. Sam Witwer as Doomsday.    He successfully turns a 2D character with no personality into one of the most intriguing, exciting parts of Smallville history. I think I enjoyed his performances more than any others this season.    Let those Season 7 wounds heal.    Enjoy Season 8 of Smallville.
B001NFNFNA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  A bit scary because it is a true story.
B0000A7W14|5.0|This is a great movie that speak to the people who been or live in the hood. not much has change
B001TODCII|5.0|Loved this movie.  Full of action. A little scary if you have kids going on spring break.
B00005JO20|3.0|Not that a fantasy movie is supposed to be logical, but it loses credibility rather quickly.  EVERYONE should have been killed in the dinosaur rampage.  The girl should have been killed 10 times over during the fight scenes with the dinosaurs.  Brody should have been attacked before finding the girl.  It goes on and on.  The insect pit was a waste of time and contributed NOTHING to the story - it's only a chance to show off the latest technologies.  This was a pure endulgence for Peter and WETA, and nothing more.  I am very disappointed that the priorities of this movie were so far off base.  Everything looked so CGI, except Kong, believe it or not.  That's where they went wrong.  Had Peter just focused on the main story line, and not gotten side tracked with cheap thrills and gross outs, we would have a much better movie.  Remember, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should.
031606792X|5.0|The fourth book in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series, Breaking Dawn is an excellent read. Stephenie has turned our vampire stereotypes around and made us see them in another light, where they truly sparkle. This aptly named book was difficult to put down, and I found myself running on very little sleep as I waited to see if and how Bella's transformation would come about. Masterfully written and highly recommended.
0743270754|5.0|Reads like a very well written novel.  I can see why Doris Kearns Goodwin previously won the Pulitzer.  She truly makes Lincoln and his colleagues come alive.

B001KR0BDI|5.0|hey i am a big reader for fantasy so u can trust me... READ IT
B00005OCMR|4.0|I watched this DVD again last night, just to see if it was only my memory recalling some of the \\"good old days\\" or to see if this really is a classy and classic film.  Well, it turns out that it was NOT just my selective memory thinking that this was an awesome show!  It is a classic bit of sci-fi and movie-making history.<br /><br />I recall the first time I saw TRON.  I saw it at a matinee when I was in college.  I told my friends about it...I went back again that night, and to the matinee again the next day.<br /><br />This movie represents a great example of the genesis of computer animation for full-feature films.  It was originally released in 1982, and now, 27 years later, it is still extremely watchable, though the special effects are extremely dated - even so, I still think that the disc games and the light cycles are the coolest!  The light cycle game has even resurfaced in a game called \\"Light Bike\\" that came on my son's iPod touch.  Take that detractors!<br /><br />One of the things that made this film memorable was not only its computer graphics, but it was released in the hey day of video game arcades.  The joint experience of this movie and the phenomenon of classic video arcades made for a memorable experience.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, well, the acting is marginal, but the story line is intruiging, and, at the time the computer graphics were mesmerising.  All in all this is a keeper, and I'm glad I have my own copy.<br /><br />When I watched it last night was, however, the first time I'd watched this DVD on a big screen TV (50\\" 720pi plasma).  I found that the image was at times a bit grainy, so that was a little distracting, but not significantly so.<br /><br />So, all in all I award this DVD 4 stars.  If you remember hanging out in video game arcades, the launch of MTV, and you are any kind of sci-fi fan at all, then this is a must-have product for you.
0800141601|2.0|If you were sitting in the next room, you would have thought that I was watching a comedy...absolutely cracking up, giggling, and rolling on the floor at the horrendous script, corny dialogue and weak acting in this movie.  Julia Ormond is very easy on the eyes, and the only redeeming feature of \\"First Knight\\"---Sean Connery pretty much phones in his stock role of Noble Wise Old Man which he's done about a million times before in his long career, and Richard Gere...well, Richard Gere is the main gut-buster here.  His acting has always been mediocre at best, just a hair better than the Keanu Reeves and Tom Cruises of Hollywood, but here his lack of talent is truly showcased in scene after scene, aided in no small part by the outrageously corny dialogue that he, Ormond and Connery are all subjected to.<br /><br />Basically, this film is the Cumbiyah-version of the King Arthur legend, in which Camelot is this incredibly loving, altruism-based (almost Buddhist, though the word \\"God\\" is thrown around a fair bit) DEMOCRACY that just happens to have an enlightened despot, er, I mean, King Arthur.  Gere's Lancelot is a fearless wanderer who spends most of the movie trying to woo Ormond's Guinevere away from her noble desire to not desire him because she's to be wedded to Connery's Arthur, the 30-40 year age difference between them be damned.<br /><br />A corny, predictable formula movie like this can only have two possible redeeming features: sex and violence.  Unfortunately this one fails on both counts...very PG-rated, no nudity or even heavy petting, and the fight scenes are amateurish at best, reminiscent of late 1970s medieval flicks, especially in comparison to the likes of Braveheart, Gladiator, etc.  Julia Ormond provides the only visual pleasure, albeit a very clean scrubbed and pastoral-looking type that you're more likely to see in church, not much erotic energy going on there.<br /><br />The 1980s film \\"Excalibur\\" was much more entertaining, in both the sex and violence departments, and far less ludicrous.and far less ludicrous.
0399230033|5.0|As I read reviews for this and other children's books, good and bad, I am struck by the number of comments in which a parent judges the story, the art, etc., rather than focusing on whether his or her child likes the book.  My daughter adores the gorilla and his pals.  She likes to color match each key with each cage, she likes to recite the animals names as they tromp back and forth across the park, she laughs everytime she sees the gorilla yawning in bed, and likes to find the mouse with the banana on every page.  A must have.
B0000257U0|5.0|As a recording engineer with some 33 years experience, I have listened to hundreds of LPs and CDs, always searching for the best examples of our art. Quite a few of those have had some connection with one of my favorite engineers, Elliot Scheiner (Steely Dan, Sting, The Eagles, R.E.M., Dave Grusin, Billy Joel, Bobby McFerrin, Donald Fagin, Eric Clapton, and many others,) who has done a spectacular job on Tambu. As the first CD since Jeff Pocaro's passing, Simon Phillips fills Jeff's shoes with some of the freshest, most creative rock playing in Toto's history and Scheiner's drum sounds are stunning! (The tom sounds on \\"I Will Remember\\" alone are worth the price of the whole CD.) The entire CD is an audio feast. Completed in 1995, before \\"loudness wars\\" squashed the dynamics of music with over-compression, this CD sounds wonderful on ear-buds to $100K audiophile systems and everything in between (go buy the best headphones you can afford for the most inexpensive Hi-Fi experience!) And for those who still think Toto is just a \\"radio\\" band, check out \\" Dave's Gone Skiing\\"--these guys can PLAY! Tambu has been in my top five for many years and I expect it to stay there for many years to come. You owe it to your ears to buy this CD!
B001MYIXAC|1.0|To begin, I love Vampire movies of all kinds. It is a guilty indulgence of mine.  I have found something in almost every one I have seen from old black and white to the current day to enjoy. For me this was just awful, it was sad, it was draining to watch, and it seemed to last for many more hours than listed. I didn't find it touching, disturbing perhaps, for the first time I had to actually force myself to watch it all the way through. Were the people who gave this movie so many stars sure that this was the movie they watched?If you want to see it I would offer you my copy, but, that seems too unkind to do to a stranger.
B000Z9PYJS|5.0|Rarely have I read anything that held my interest like Life of Pi by Yann Martel.  My undergraduate degree is in Jewish Studies and I am fascinated by the big questions in life.  Martel tackles these questions head-on in a way that is accessible and enjoyable.    Martel thrusts the reader into a world very different from the one many will be familiar with.  The twists and turns begin almost immediately and continue throughout the novel.  Life of Pi is a book that will likely be interpreted differently and bring different meaning to every reader who approaches it.  This is the great genius of Martel's work.    Like all great wisdom literature, Life of Pi includes many quotes that strike one as profound on first read and require additional thought to draw out the deeper meaning.  For example, \\"...the Greater Good and the Greater Profit are not compatible aims.\\"  This sort of throws a wrench into the corporate social responsibility strategies, or does it?    Life of Pi is a book that can be read over and over again with new insights and new meanings each time.  It is one book that deserves all the hype.

B00026WU82|5.0|No one will agree on which Bob Dylan album is his best.  He created such a vast number of songs in so many varying styles, some of which may appeal to someone more than others, that it is hard to lay down the judgment, \\"This Is Best.\\"   That said, for me, this is Dylan's best electronic work.  For the uninitiated, let me briefly give a little history: Dylan had started out as a folk singer/song-writer doing topical songs, \\"protest songs\\" as some called them.  Whatever you want to call them, they were social in matter and perspective. (See, \\"Blowin in the Wind\\").    Ah, but wait.  Dylan wanted a change.  Around 1964-65 he began to write music you might say is a bit freer than his earlier material.  In several interviews from the time, he says he was getting bored doing the whole solo guitar gig thing and wanted to work with a group, he wanted a different sound.  Alright, so he did an album called \\"Bringing it All Back Home,\\" which is sort of half and half.  Eleven songs on the album, seven are the new electronic sound--famously, \\"Maggie's Farm\\" and \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\"--and four are in the \\"old\\" style--\\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue.\\"    Great music, it's a really fun album, but because it mixes styles, it doesn't exactly feel even.  Still a gas to listen to.  But, later in 65, Dylan released this album, \\"Highway 61 Revisited.\\"  This album is pretty damn near perfect.  Unlike its predecessor, it doesn't mix styles, but fully explores the electronic music Dylan had adopted.  Moreover, it is not as long as its successor, \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" (which many people consider Dylan's best, and the third most important rock album of the era).  \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" thus gains a sort of balance which allows you, while listening, to absorb the music a bit more completely.  Now, my reasons for preferring this album are contained in what I have more or less described.  Listening to this album is not just enjoyable, enlightening, almost spiritual, itseasy--at least as easy as Dylan gets.  Don't mistake me, I don't mean to say easy as in, not difficult, I mean easy as in, the album is smooth, its length manageable, its music potent while being well constructed--it flows well.  One can become intimate with this album in ways I don't think it is possible to be with \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" (although I do love that album as well).  This is a good album to get if you're interested in this particular style Dylan worked with.  I only know a bit about the folk and pretty much nothing about his later work after \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" so for any info on that, you'll have to hunt it up yourself.  But, if the electronic music is your scene, this is a great place to start.  I think I should add that I'm just a fan of Bob Dylan, and that any criticism of his work is out of my own meager brains.  I don't presume to tell you what Bob Dylan thinks, or what you should think.  I do hope that you'll enjoy the music.
1416914307|5.0|I just finished my copy of City of Glass and I'm simply buzzing with that awesome high you get from reading a truly fantastic book! I couldn't put it down - really!  I picked up this book with a multitude of expectations and fears - there were many secrets that had to be revealed, issues resolved and points summed up. There was also the fear that this book would follow in the foot steps of so many YA novels of late and be strangely anti-climatic and disappointing (e.g. Stephenie Meyer's Breaking Dawn) or that the favourite main characters would be killed off or turned into trees (e.g. Libba Bray's The Sweet Far Thing - still a fantastic novel so make sure you read the series if you haven't already).  I am extremely pleased to report that book does not leave you feeling in the least bit disappointed and although there are sad aspects, i did not finish feeling extremely distraught and inclined to send abusive fan mail to the Cassandra Clare in order to vent my indignance and distress.  There is plenty of action, mystery, magic and that special something that makes these gritty urban fantasies irrestibale.   There is lots of Jace, for any fans out there, and the pages are simply bursting with emotion.  Overall, i read this book in one sitting, i barely paused to eat! and it was a wonderful conclusion to this amazing series.  I look forward to more books from this excellent author! (Still buzzing from the high!)
B001EYGOEM|4.0|Taylor Swift dives headfirst into the music industry with her new album, Fearless. Fearless is definately one of my favorite albums. Taylor has a sweet, knowing voice, and this album scores a spot right next to her debut.  Fearless/\\"And I don't know why, but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress, fearless.\\" A first date that goes really well.  Fifteen/\\"When you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're going to believe them.\\" This song is a bittersweet memoir of high school.  Love Story/\\"It's a love story, baby, just say yes.\\" An amazing, beautiful song about true love.   Hey Stephen/\\"I can't help it if you look like an angel, can't help it if I want to kiss you in the rain.\\" Taylor's ode to her crush, who is named Stephen.  White Horse/\\"Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around.\\" A melancholy song about disappointment in love.  You Belong with Me/\\"All this time how could you not know baby, you belong with me.\\"  She's hopelessly in love with a boy whose girlfriend doesn't know him or care about him. Who doesn't know something about that?  Breathe/\\"And I can't breathe without you, but I have to.\\" Co-written and with backup vocals by singer Colbie Caillat, Breathe is a song about being in love with someone, and having to say goodbye.   Tell Me Why/\\"And I know that you see what you're doing to me; tell me why.\\" This song was not one I personally liked. Taylor seems to be involved with someone who verbally and mentally abuses her, and writes a song about it.  You're Not Sorry/\\"And you can tell me that you're sorry but I don't believe you baby like I did before; you're not sorry.\\" Sorry, this is just a little too repetitive. It's okay, but not exceptional. A song about a boy who keeps apologizing for things he won't stop doing.  The Way I Loved You/\\"I'm so in love that I acted insane, and that's the way I loved you.\\" Taylor has found, ultimately, the perfect boyfriend. He is a true gentleman, treats her very well and gets alongwith her folks. But she realizes that though she likes him, she misses her previous boyfriend, who was much wilder.  Forever & Always/\\"I was there when you said forever and always.\\" Yeah, for those who don't know, a tribute to her ex, Joe Jonas. All in all, a pretty good song, although for Jonas brothers fans: be warned.  The Best Day/\\"I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run and I had the best days with you.\\" A touching song dedicated to Taylor's family.  Change/\\"These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down.\\" Very different from the other songs on this album, Change is one of my favorites. She sang part of it on New Year's Eve in New York.  Overall, I think that Fearless is an album people can relate to. There's a reason Taylor's so popular, and that's because she's an authentic and talented teenager with some real talent. She either wrote or co-wrote ALL of the songs on this album, and how cool is that?
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Yea, I never buy DVDs for anything, I don't even buy movies that I love. However, this show compelled me to buy the DVD, yes it was that amazing. The character interaction and dynamic, character development, suspense, plot twists, interesting story-lines, and poetic qualities to the show all made me fall in love with this show.    Buy this DVD because it is 6.58 hours of pure awesome for only $19. Sure it doesn't have the budget that Terminator 2 had, but it is just as amazing. As a kid we love action, but as we get older, we are more interested in suspense. This movie does have action as well, but it's focus on storyline is refreshing for television.     Such mysterious storylines got us hooked to movies like Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and TV series like X-Files. If you've ever liked any of those movies for the storyline, you'll love TSCC.

B00005N6KG|1.0|I buy many headphones, they ALL start out fine. But after using them a couple of time for running, one of the sides stops working and they constantly shift when you run.

0618918248|1.0|Richard Dawkins dislike of religion does not make an objective book on God possible. I kept notes while reading and had 10 pages of objections before I decided to give it up. He proceeds relentlessly from his preconceived starting point to his predetermined conclusion. His highly selective examples are used in a haphazard manner best suited to his needs. Some are amateurish conjectures, some incoherent misinterpretations, almost all unprofessionally argued.    Science is the study of the behavior of particles in motion. Science is mute on ethics and morals, it only describes one aspect of reality, it doesn't even begin to give us a full description of knowledge.    Dawkins unwisely teaches that the theory of evolution has explained away God's existence. Not even close. So in this book he attempts to give us a sophisticated seminar on godlessness because it is evident religion will not die on it's own accord.     Those who speak of the elimination of religion fail to explain how this elimination is to take place. If atheism saw itself as one religious option among many, there would not be a problem. Atheism, however, has a disturbing tendency to see itself as the only faith. I'm wondering what were suppose to understand by the quote on the inside cover that goes, \\"If this book doesn't change the world were all screwed.\\" Modern society prizes itself on tolerance and has limited patience with those who demand the elimination of beliefs and or believers.    Dawkin's tell us to not go with the lazy default of gullibility in believing in God, but to live your life as the evidence dictates. That evidence is staring us full in the face in his chapter, \\"Why there almost certainly is no God.\\" Mathematicians have calculated the odds of a right fit life supporting universe making itself out of random chance and they are astronomical. Dawkins describes just one of them, the strong nuclear force. Had it's value been off one thousands of a degree the universe as we know it would not exist. Multiply scores more similar factors and the theory of evolution is reeling for an explanation. Let's not forget the birth of the universe out of nothing. How does Dawkins handle this damaging indictment against his 'certainty'? Like a defense lawyer.    He \\"dumbs it down for the jury.\\" He calls the precision numbers the \\"Goldilocks zone.\\" He paints a picture of God in a lab coat turning dials to fine tune his universe just so, calling God, the 'Divine Knob Twiddler.' Incredible Dawkin's logic tells us the problem in this argument is that an impossibly unlikely universe would require an impossibly complex divine super-intellect one notch beyond impossible. So if an all knowing all powerful supreme being [God] is beyond HIS belief, let's all go with nothing and say 'Zilch' made everything. That's more likely and makes better sense. You can bet your soul on it.    Science has the luxury of not having to be certain or definite of anything. When new ideas surface old ones are discarded. People shouldn't concern themselves with getting ID into the schools but they should lobby to get Darwinism out. It is a religious/philosophy that disqualifies any rival ideas. Any one who objects is accused of making a religious claim because it goes against what Darwinism will allow. Irreducibly complex structures in the cell cannot exist simply because it is outside of what Darwinism teaches. If that's the case then forensics, archaeology, and the search for extraterestial intelligence should all be discontinued as branches of science, because they all rely on discovering patterns that cannot be the result of the natural law of chance.    A few pages after the cosmological anthropic principal blunder I stopped reading. Dawkins goes to a 'mad scientist' theory to help bail him out of the fine tuned universe argument. He searches for a natural selection type of band aid and finds it in the multi-verse. Zillions times zillions of universe edge to edge like soap bubbles in a kitchen sink with us living in the lucky bubble. This theory has zero credibility. But all that is required to stretch your imagination to accept this science fiction is what he calls, \\"Darwinian conscience raising.\\" I guess physicists feel more comfortable talking about what they can explain and haven't yet quiet caught on to, coins down the well wishful thinking.    Never trade in what you do know for what you don't know. You know there is one universe. You know it had a beginning. You know it had to have a cause. You know it had to have been created for a cause. And by examining the properties of the universe what or who created it must be phenomenal. If anything this book should lead the honest seeker to God, because it is fraught with problems. I recommend, \\"The reason for God\\" by Timothy Keller and \\"What's So Great About Christianity\\" by Dinesh D'Souza. Those books have great answers for every hard ball question you can think of. Dawkins is a fine biologist and author but he struggles with a personal bias when it comes to this subject. Keep searching, there is many great books to read, don't let a poor one like this have the final say.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Good movie, would like to see the theatre version someday. Too bad Sarah Brightman could not have sung in it although this young lady has a good voice. Would recommend this movie to others who like romantic musicals.

0312360266|3.0|I have read all the books in this series except for the latest book and I must say that I am very dissapointed. This first book starts off ok but by the time you get to the third book you will be left with a feeling of being cheated.  There is a difference between suspense between books and milking the consumer financially.  Books 1-3 occures over the course of about one and a half to two months, excessive much?  This story could have been written on one or two books but the authors seem to want to drag out the story needlessly. A much better series would be Vampire Academy.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|The progression between this album and Blood Mountain is quite amazing. They have taken such a leap in their song-writing but also production. It is such a dense album, layered guitars, vocals, astounding melodies. I love many types of music (I have been listening to Underworld, Latin Jazz and A Tribe Called Quest) but my first love for music came in the form of Metal and it really is so promising to hear a great record that pushes the boundaries of what \\"Metal\\" should be. I for one as a fan of good metal (neurosis, cult of luna, isis etc) am sick of the the attitudes critics towards Metal as being some music for idiots or bone heads or wateva so i am hoping in some new records by Mastodon, the new Isis and surprisingly the Decmberists records (which is amazing by the way and quite heavy in places which is sure to disappoint the close minded \\"indie\\" fan) go towards countering this idiotic stance that critics take. But anyway back on this record it is astounding, the perfomances are just stellar, Brian's drumming is amazing because whilst he is obviously technically brilliant he never plays in a way that is too much for what the songs need. The convergence between his Stevie Wonder/ Phil Collins really shows here. I can't get enough of the vocal melodies of this album he really shines as a \\"singer\\" and I for one are happy about it. This is an amazingly powerful and beautiful record and I think in the next decade or so will be seen as a landmark. Have an open mind and marvel at the brilliance of this record.
1595141979|5.0|I read this book in a day; I was unable to put it down.  I was saddend but never dissapointed. I won't go into story details but I was very pleased with this book and I can't wait for the next in the series.
B001R4MEYI|4.0|I think Decibel was correct when they stated this album is a \\"grower not a shower.\\"  Certainly the most ambitious of all the Mastodon albums, it may also be the most rewarding album the band has made up to this point.  Gone is the band of \\"March of the Fire Ants\\" and \\"Mother Puncher,\\" and in its place we see the stunning songcraft and musicianship of a maturing band for the ages.  If your Mastodon fandom was based solely on the heavy chugging riffs of old this cd will probably not be your cup of tea, but for the open-minded fan this album will be a spectacular ride sure to enthrall throughout the coming years.
B00004XPPB|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The dialog was unbearable.  I felt embarrassed for the director, actors, etc. as I watched it.  I can't believe a piece of trash like this has gotten such good reviews.  Aside from unrealistic plot points, idiotic characters, and ugly script, there are simple technical mistakes, including a camera flash going off during the scene when Madsen threatens to 'wack' Depp.  Also there are several continuity errors through the film that made me literally cringe.  Lastly, the score for the film is ridiculously overbearing through the entire film.  It was as if it had been composed for some B horror flick.  This is my advice, take Donnie Brasco and put it back on the shelf and find a copy of Good Fellas if you want to see a great mob film.[[ASIN:0790729725 GoodFellas]]
B000P12LWY|1.0|I'm giving this one star for the frickin' menus, which they couldn't have made more difficult to navigate if they were trying to torture the user.  I almost put my fist through my new high def display when I got the umpteenth \\"This operation prohibited by disc\\" message just trying to get to the main menu to select an episode.  Clearly they didn't test this on actual humans to determine its ease of use.    The show itself is OK, with decent acting in most roles.  There are, of course, historical inaccuracies for the sake of drama, and numerous times when the dialog sounds anachronistic.  The cinematography is gorgeous, and it looks great in high def.
1439136653|2.0|This novel is a politically correct piece of work from an author who is a career diplomat. You will not see any bitter truths in this novel. When you are a diplomat you write this kind of novel. Ram mohammd thomas the name itself is insult to Lord Rama, but it is a great name if you want to look good by everyone. Putting Rama who was an Ideal man and had just one wife with Mohmmad who had 9 wives and his last exploit was a 9 year old Aiysha, is an insult to all hindus and hinduism. Rama's narrative Ramayana does not speak of religions as it is understood in the middle east and in the west. In Ramayana they talk about Dharma, which is one's duty in the world. How to be an ideal administrator, an ideal husband/wife, an ideal student and an ideal brother. That is Ramayana.    Mohmmad's koran is about seeing the world in \\"us and them\\" paradigm. \\"Us\\" are muslims and \\"them\\" is rest of the world. If you are \\"them\\" you deserve no respect. All kind of bad things can be done to people in the \\"them\\". I will not narrate them here. Please read about koran elsewhere.    Suffice it to say that you will not expect a career diplomat, who are usually taught to call an axe, with 20 other names but not an axe, to be able to tell the truth.  I was disappointed by this novel. It is an attempt to fool people in to living in a wishywashy world.    On the other hand if you do not care about the truth, but rather live in fantasies, this novel is a great read.
0780626966|5.0|The Nightmare on Elm Street collection is an amazing box set of movies featuring the main antagonist for all 7 films, Freddy Krueger. A must have for any fans of the series or if your just looking to dive into classic horror movies from the 80's and the early 90's. 5 stars!

If you're reading this, Granny Grey, thank you very much :)
B001N18HOQ|5.0|I love what Brendan O'Brien did with the original tracks. Don't worry, the same vibe is there, just less unnecessary reverb.  He pushes Ed's voice to the forefront and cranks up McCready's lead guitars!  Fantastic!  The only thing that might be a little polarizing is Brendan's remix of \\"Jeremy\\" which loses the \\"Do Do DoDo DoDoDoo\\" in favor of more volume on the guitar.  I love it, but I can see where some might miss it.  Can't wait for the new album!
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Fans of Mastodon will definitely not be disappointed. I believe this album to be Mastodon's best, and possibly a candidate for best metal album of the year. The band has grown, and this is its most mature and fulfulling work.<br /><br />While there's plenty of heavy here, Mastodon ventures into longer, more melodious songs. Is Mastodon the new prog metal standard? It certainly seems like they're making a case for it here. There's not as much face melting as in Blood Mountain. The vocals are easily the best than on any other Mastodon release; they're clean, and I like that. Others don't, which I appreciate. The \\"Score\\" disk features the songs as instrumentals, which is a decent album in its own right.<br /><br />It's a very pleasant listen. The first two songs are good, don't get me wrong, but the album doesn't really pick up momentum until \\"Quintessence.\\" That track, \\"The Czar,\\" and the title track are the best, IMO.

0375413405|5.0|If you really want to get into French cooking, with lots of the tricks and tools pick up Jacques Pepin's \\"Complete Techniques\\" and enjoy it greatly, it's fantastic. If you want to get into French cooking and do it this weekend pick up Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking.<br /><br />The recipes are not only workable, you can get some fantastic results and shock your family with them. A lot of the recipes in this book can be done with very little prep work and a single trip to a decently stocked supermarket. I don't use it everyday because, honestly, I don't need the extra weight it would surely put on. I use it on weekends when I have the time to look the book over carefully and decide what looks good and then I put something other than roast chicken or steak on the table. My family really seems to enjoy it when I pull this out on Saturday morning and then ask if anyone wants to come with me to the store.<br /><br />This book also allows you to stretch your comfort level a bit and try techniques and recipes that you normally wouldn't want to because of expense, hard to find ingredients and, in my case, fear of failure. I don't mind messing up a chili that only cost me some time and few dollars but toss a tenderloin on the counter with a complex recipe and my nerves can get a little strained. The techniques offered here show you that you can make an incredible meal without the incredible kitchen.<br /><br />The book is written in a style that really brings Julia Child out to the front. I picture her doing the recipe on her old PBS show and everytime I bring down a knife I can hear that distinctive voice telling me how to do it.<br /><br />I've had this book for about two years now, it's dogeared, stained and it's never far from my kitchen.
0553807048|2.0|Who would write a book boasting about snitching on all their friends? And it's unclear to me why he needs to describe every detail of his sex life with his wife. Classy. What he needs to do is  learn to write a sentence that doesn't have a cliche in it; and if I ever see the word \\"alas\\" again I'm going to shoot myself in the head. His first book was amusing, due to the drug and spending sprees, unfortunately this book takes place after those ended.
B000P2A256|4.0|While it seems funny that there are some who deride Maroon 5 for \\"toughening\\" their sound for \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long,\\" it's almost oxymoronic. \\"Tough\\" and \\"Maroon 5\\" are not mutually compatible terms. Granted, this album sounds punchier and tighter than the four year old [[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]], but that makes them about as tough as chewy chocolate chip cookies.<br /><br />And there's absolutely nothing wrong with Chewy Chocolate Cookies. In fact, I pick them up as a treat every once in a while. Which is why \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" makes a nice musical treat. Adam Levine has evolved quickly into a terrific blue-eyed soul singer, and his bandmates have become a tight, first class pop group. They have started to cheerfully flaunt their influences (the Sting/Police guitar in \\"Can't Stop\\", the Bee Gees vocal inflections). If you don't find yourself humming along to \\"If I Never See Your Face,\\" \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\" or \\"Makes Me Wonder,\\" then you're just prejudiced against poptunes.<br /><br />On the other hand, should oldies from Wham, Hall & Oates or your copy of [[ASIN:B000P6R6VK Saturday Night Fever]] come out of your CD case every once in awhile (along with your Chewy Chocolate Cookies), then \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" will satisfy.
B000TBI40I|5.0|As cobbled-together albums go, THE BEATLES AGAIN (also known as \\"Hey Jude\\") is about as good as it gets. The 10 songs presented on it are from singles and B-sides, and cover the majority of the band's stellar career. Not one of these could be considered throwaway or filler.<br /><br />John Lennon's lead vocals on all five of his songs are some of his most powerful ever. The track of \\"Revolution\\" presented is the one Lennon came up with following the rejection of his slower \\"Revolution 1\\" for consideration as the group's next single after \\"Lady Madonna.\\" Commonly labeled \\"the fast-version,\\" some spine-tingling guitar work make this unforgettable. The several Paul McCartney tunes were some of the group's biggest hits. George Harrison's lone contribution, \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" is high-energy and has an infectious hook.<br /><br />If you don't already own this one, here is a \\"fab\\" opportunity to enjoy...

B001V7WC1Q|3.0|The mood and tempo of this film is great - reminded me alot of 'Insomnia', which I loved in both the foreign and American versions. Slowly paced, set in a dark and snowy Sweden.<br /><br />The film is set in 1982, which is a bit odd, as its obviously not based on a true story nor is there anything in the telling of the story which really requires it, save an appearance by a Rubick's Cube. Maybe the original story was more timely.<br /><br />The dubbing on the dubbed version is fine for the two main characters, not as great for the supporting characters but its adequate. However, there are two handwritten notes between the main characters in the film which are not translated, which in my opinion is inexcusable, as one seems fairly substantial.<br /><br />As many will note, this is not a 'scary' horror movie although there are certainly horror scenes, some graphic. Its is more about the relationship between the two main characters - don't let that keep anyone from seeing this film, though, its a gem.

B000TBG8HY|5.0|MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was a dismal failure as a [[ASIN:B008RTE08E BBC television special]], and justly so. In fact, it was so awful the program never aired in the United States. Unscripted, ad-lib and haphazard, the film's occasional musical performance highlights couldn't redeem this silly exercise in group personal excess.<br /><br />Conversely, the American record album of \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" (ironically unavailable in Britain) is a wondrous thing, indeed. Several Top 40 records that weren't a part of that original program are used to flesh out this set. Inside the LP's gatefold cover is an attached booklet of 12 × 12 photos taken from the TV show. Also included are complete song lyrics, a trend that began with [[ASIN:B000MU4F5Y SGT.

I was excited to hear the DTS-HD Master Audio and totally immerse myself in the band.  Problem is, the surround mix just totally immerses you in Geoff Downes!    I saw another review online that asks how this mix could've been released.  I wonder the same thing myself.  What happened?!!  It's really like listening to the keys monitor mix.  Can't hear Steve much at all, and Carl is a distant mono.  Is this a problem with my player?  Do I need to update it?  Or is this issue with the mix?  In any case, it's very disappointing.
0930289234|3.0|Simply put this book is not what it was, although what once was might be again.  Much seems contracted and redacted in the story.  Some of the more striking scenes appear lifted from other sources.  The burlesque and vaudeville work alongside the \\"smart bully\\" style story, with interludes of gracious prose and reference.  As a brief commercial treatise, the entire flow as presently given can be seen as a pleasant failure among the waterfall of global entertainment failures.  I can say it is pleasant because a few blonde tramps seem to adore the book.  I can say it is a failure because I didn't get laid by them.<br /><br />Our present Moore probably wants to write significant stories of grace and seems bored and hassled with the more furious pulp styles.  No doubt his pulp magazine subscription has expired, but this does not decrease his power with the rarely occurring elongated prose passage.<br /><br />Watchmen is a graphic novel that directs satire at the naive politics of old comic book adventures.  The approach used seems rushed to me, somehow impatient, or perhaps there was greater business afoot at the time.<br /><br />One might be caused feelings of regret because the meager space permitted in this graphic novel.<br /><br />At present tense, Moore is most capable at extravagant literary asides that are pleasing to the wit.  When violence and sex become foremost, he panders just as Rice and Barker sometimes do, using silly plot devices and insipid character development.  However, when it is a question of mannered imaginative prose, he approaches the issue with dignity and capability.  In this, he is reminiscent of Clive Barker, Anne Rice, and (to a very limited extent) Bukowski.<br /><br />Moore is not truly one who authors action adventure in the high style of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Fritz Leiber, or Robert Howard.  Moore is a quiet gentleman of letters and literature.  Moore should be permitted his writing desk, ink pot, and quill.  Otherwise he might puke allover us next time.  Ah, there's the fellow, there's the lad.<br /><br />Gibbons is a traditional comic book artist and a dramatic artist too although the color sometimes obscures the splendid line interaction.  An economy of gestures are used in image while still maintaining a sense of fullness in the depictions and eye catching \\"sufficient realism\\" in each panel.  The approach Gibbons has to face and posture of characters makes the comic book into a silent opera: the gestures are operatic, the facial expressions are stiff, the jaws tense, the musculature rarely relaxed.  Again, the colors are bright and almost dizzying.  An effect is achieved: it is confusing, yet Gibbons manages a perfect beauty in placement.  Gibbons is a pretty.<br /><br />As to the cover: I seem to recall similar paintings in a gallery, with many different colors of spirtle and background and disc.  This might have been before the comic book issues that lead to the graphic novel.<br /><br />One wonders if this graphic novel is a particular bulge that formed in mist that shall soon vanish.  Let us hope neither Moore nor Gibbons vanish soon.  Gibbons is too darling and well put, Moore is kicking the dirt clods out of the path so he can be Queen of the May along a route.

B0012GMWCU|5.0|Willie Dixon is best known as a songwriter, composer, arranger, producer, and session player for Chicago's Chess Records, but he also recorded occationally as a band leader. This 1970 LP is a collection of some of his 1960s Chess sides, including \\"Back Door Man\\", \\"The Little Red Rooster\\", and \\"Spoonful\\", and you can get most of his remaining Chess sides on the MCA-CD \\"The Original Wang Dang Doodle\\". But start with this one, because it is by far the best!    These songs are best known through men like Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, and Otis Rush, of course, but here they are as performed by the original composer himself. William James Dixon wasn't a singer of the caliber of Muddy Waters or the mighty Howlin' Wolf, but he had a pleasant baritone voice, and here he goes a long way towards making up for his lack of a really distinctive singing voice with his expressive phrasing and overall intelligent use of the vocal power that he does have.    The production is excellent, crisp and clear, and the drums bite harder than on many 50s and 60s blues sides without being obtrusive. And the band or bands backing Dixon are magnificent...I say \\"band or bands\\" because there are absolutely no credits to be found, which is really annoying, but a good guess would be that the (absolutely superb) pianist is the great Lafayette Leake, and the drummer may be Clifton James. The harpist doesn't really sound like anyone that I can identify just by listening to him; it sometimes sounds like the huge, horn-like tones of Little Walter Jacobs, but it probably isn't, but it may well be Dixon's own favourite harpist, Big Walter Horton.    So, why would you buy a collection of songs that Muddy Waters and the Wolf have also recorded when those guys were much better singers? Well, because this isn't just Muddy Waters' single \\"The Same Thing\\" or Wolf's \\"Spoonful\\" only with different vocals. These are significantly different versions of those songs, different enough to warrant a listen for that reasonalone, and as great as the better known versions are, most of these nine songs are in fact just as terrific.  \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" has little besides the lyrics in common with Howlin' Wolf's searing rendition; Dixon's take on his own song is more up-tempo, with a clanging boogie piano part...wonderful, rollicking R&B, made for dancing to! \\"Back Door Man\\" is a tough, swaggering boast full of sexual bravado. And this jouyously swinging version of Willie Mabon's superbly melodic 1955 single \\"The Seventh Son\\" is absolutely irresistable with its lively upper-register piano fills and Dixon's energetic vocal.    Once you become familiar with his burly baritone you'll start to appreciate Willie Dixon as a singer, I'm sure...I'm starting to like his voice almost as much as Muddy's gruff, manly vocals, or Wolf's ferocious, growling roar of a voice. And as an arranger Dixon was unbeatable, as this volume amply demonstrates.  This is good-time Chicago blues and R&B of the very, very highest order. It's not as intense as prime Howlin' Wolf or Otis Rush, sure, but it is exquisitely presented and utterly charming, and the fidelity is terrific. Very, very highly recommended!
B001PPGAIA|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from this film from the mixed bag of reviews I'd seen and heard. Before the film's release, I'd heard about this really BIG, old-fashioned movie about Australia coming out, but once it did all I heard was silence. I don't know one person who went to see it at the theater. So my husband and I rented it and we rather enjoyed it. It's VERY long, almost 3 hours, but the time passed quickly as the story held our interest. It does kind of bounce around from plotline to plotline, but we were interested the whole time and felt we wanted to watch it again when it was over. I was a little disappointed with Nichole Kidman. She's usually so incredibly wonderful, but she seems to have had some \\"work\\" done on her face so that her facial movements looked awkward and her expressiveness was hindered. She just didn't look natural at all, and I found myself distracted by looking at her odd lips and cheeks. Also, as with many modern movies, the CG effects are so heavy handed that they don't look real at all and (to me) take away from the sense of reality in the film. Hugh Jackman is divine, though. Hunky, muscular, and rough in all the right places, his Drover is the perfect Australian souvenir. I wonder if real Australians found this character stereotypical, because it seemed the director was using the Drover to symbolize Australia to the the viewer. He was a rough-and-tumble bloke who never shied away from a fight, had liberated views about the Aboriginal people, and turned into a dashing hero when the moment called for it. So overall, I will recommend the movie as a good choice for movie night at your house. I think kids might even enjoy it though mine weren't home when we watched it.

B0015AARJI|2.0|I am about to have to purchase my third ps3 controller after they literally keep falling apart in my hands.  I don't drop them or attempt to inflict damage on them in any way but they keep breaking.  On my first two controllers the springs for the triggers broke and now on the third one, the plastic shell has been breaking off piece by piece.  I never had this problem with PS2 controllers, these PS3 controls are very fragile and not worth the price.
1580493904|1.0|I teach high school English and ordered this version for my classes because of the low price and the promise of a glossary. I regret my choice and am looking for a new version to replace this one. I don't care for this translation (although I can only compare it to other translations and not the original). I have study guides and tests that I'd made using different versions of the text, and I can't find the answers to many of the questions in this text although I can in other texts. So while I don't know exactly what the problem is, I found this version to have awkward wording and be more difficult for my students to understand that others I have used.
0316017922|5.0|By writing my first poetic memoir That Which Awakens Me (Spring/Summer 2009), I've been able to discover, understand, accept, embrace, and love the identities that I was born with and created. It has been an inner self revolution that opened a door to authentic living. This process also gave me the opportunitiy to Gladwell's book Outliers as a framework for exploring and appreciating how childhood, family, culture, community, friendship, history, and geography have played a role in my life experiences, accomplishments, and career trajectory. These efforts brought me face to face with my values, beliefs, social privileges, and cultural legacies. What an eye-opening experience! I encourage you to check out the video from the 92nd Street Y featuring a great interview with Gladwell. Click here to watch the video: [...]Enjoy! Buy the book. It is amazing!

However, many of the agreements we make are based on false perceptions of who we truly are...our authentic self before any wounds.  The Four Agreements that Miguel suggests are fundamental practices that are capable of transforming daily living into profound opportunities to reconnect with God, ourselves and others from a place of love, joy, gratitude and inner freedom rather than judgement, guilt, self doubt and fear.

B00008G9JM|5.0|Lucas Biddle, above, said it all.    People either love or hate this album. I'm in my mid-30s, so I grew up in the 80s, when the only music with any real depth that was accessible on the radio was heavy metal like Iron Maiden or Black Sabbath/Dio. But this makes that stuff look like children's music.     Anyway, I have some friends in their mid-20s who think they have depth when it comes to music. They aren't far wrong- Coheed and Cambria and the other kinds of stuff they listen to isn't bad at all, and some of it has some real depth, but sorry, nothing compares to JT at the height of their musical powers- except perhaps ELP (the dove, bss, tarkus) or KC (red, larks, Islands or court of) of course. Anyway, I played Aqualung for them, and they said \\"that stinks, Courtney\\".   Why is it that when people actually HATE something, it's almost *almways* because they don't understand it. This album has taken a lot of flak. Now, I think anyone who's reading this review will agree that my 20-year old friends said that about Aqualung for one reason only: They couldn't get their minds around it- ie, they don't understand Aqualung, it didn't fit with the little model in their minds of what rock music \\"should\\" sound like.  So it is with APP. There are Jethro Tull fans who will slam this album the same way my ignorant friends slammed Aqualung, and with even greater passion in their revulsion. Why is that? It doesnt fit with thier little pre-concieved model of what Jethro Tull \\"Should\\" sound like. It breaks the barriers, shatters myths and preconceptions.    If you will look up the history of all of the greatest works of art that were considered ground-breaking, without variance they all have one thing in common: they were despised by their contemporaries, with a passion.    This album is like that. One day, mark my words, we will probably be long dead, but one day, if Rock every becomes a fully-fledged classical reperatoire like jazz and classical, someone will look back and understand what this album was about, and it will be studied the way Bach and Rameu and Mozart are studied now.   One other reason this album is so hated: it dares trod on the feet of jazz and classical, without being either. Society likes homogeneity and for things to be easily classified, tagged, and easily filed away, so we can make judgements on it without ever having to actually listen to it. If Metallica did a country song, could you imagine how angry thier narrow-minded fans and corporate backers would be? This is the same reason interracial couples were forbidden in society for a long time.    Anyway, as their opinions on Aqualung are so unevolved, I wonder what my narrowminded friends would say if they ever heard THIS album? It would probably turn their brains to slush and cause blood to flow out of their ears if they ever actually listened enough to begin to get an inkling of what it is about.    Courtney
1439102813|5.0|Rarely have I been so deeply moved by a book.  Not often does the character befriend me and I gladly accept all her secrets to my keeping. Never have I not written a review for over a month simply because I am still in mourning.  All this occurred because of \\"Still Alice,\\" by the brilliant author, Lisa Genova.    Alice is a tenured, deeply respected professor at Harvard.  Accolades surround her; some jealousy jousts with others in her field occur, but mainly at parties she and her Harvard Science professor husband hold court.  Three bright children have come from their union...two highly productive and one very artistic.  \\"The charmed life\\" seems coined for this couple, until........Alice notices lapses of thought, forgets how to return home while jogging on a daily path, rampages the next door neighbor's kitchen mistaking it for her own, and rambles during lectures she may remember  to attend or NOT.    Off to the neurologist, whom after testing Alice, relates quite flatly that she has \\"onset Alzheimer's\\" at the age of 50.  Her husband rages at this diagnosis.  Her children fear.  For the rest of the journey we follow Alice, her deepest thoughts, her clumsy mistakes, her journey's into past memories while the present moments are lost.    The mesmerizing prose is so eloquent it aids in reading Alice's demise into dementia.  The scientific accents help in understanding the mechanics of what is happening to beloved Alice's brain.  The human emotions exhibited make it so real and so honest we can not remain detached bystanders even though many of her family and friends do just that.    If you read no other book this year, read this one.  It will be a painful journey, but you will be so grateful for the knowledge and, as in my case, for meeting Alice.  She became a dear friend and I will always love her.    Gayla Collins
B000QEIORG|3.0|I thought this would provide some great extras songs, but was very disapointed by the extras, the quality is poor and the songs slow.  Do your research and buy the original release, not this extended version.<br /><br />I love the Foo Figthers, but this CD will give you a bad taste, do your research.

B000FFJYB6|5.0|I rarely get the opportunity to go to the movie theaters so I catch a lot of films on DVD or on Cable.    I watched MY DOG SKIP on HBO and it was indeed a rare treat.  I love family films, especially if they are in an older setting that move you and stay with you for a while to come.      MY DOG SKIP is one of such films.  This was not a kids flick, indeed this is a young adult/adult movie narrated by the author of the same book - based on the true story of his dog Skip, now a national bestseller novel.    Willie Morris' parents give him a Jack Russell puppy for this ninth birthday.  He proceeds to bond with is dog, who's precocious and loving manner teaches Willie how to deal with the pressures of being a kid and coming of age in Mississippi in the 1940's.    This film moved me with its depth of emotional intensity and beauty, unlike any I have seen in a long time.  It was beautifully acted, the moments depicting the situations remembered by Willie regarding his escapades with his dog and friends - who loved Skip equally, are one of a kind.  I highly recommend this film to any animal lover and anyone who wants a film that will move and touch them (yes, there are several sad moments - but it is the circle of life) as it is undoubtedly one of the most splendid films I have seen in a long time.

B0018M6J90|5.0|Frances McDormand is brilliant as her role of Miss Pettigrew in this charming, sensitive and beautiful little movie set in pre-war (WW2) England.    Fired from her last position for her outspoken manner, Miss Pettigrew is informed at her employment agency that she has lost too many positions to be recommended for another post.  It's the late 30's, with the threat of war heavy in the air, jobs are scarce and in desperation, she grabs the newly arrived address of a client in need of an assistant.    Delysia Lafoose (Amy Adams) is an actress/singer, looking for the best guy to set her up as his paramour and offer her protection in a high society where knowing everyone and making the best first impression will either break you or make you.      Delysia is having a guy crisis and is really in need of someone to help her make decisions, and since acquiring the services of an assistant is now the de-rigeur thing to do, she keeps Ms. Pettigrew after she saves the day.  As she also covets the lead role in a new play on the west end.    Delysia feels an instant infusion of \\"like\\" for sensible Ms Pettigrew and immediately sets out to get her some much needed new outfits that will make Miss Pettigrew fit in with the upper, ever so, crowd.      Completely at a loss and way out of her element, Miss Pettigrew is swept along by the impetuous and light hearted Delysia as she flits about from situation to situation, all in one day!     With a ton of humorous moments and a lovely dose of romance this is a not to missed gem of a film.  Superbly acted on all counts, and set in a glittering era full of nostalgia before the destruction of the war in England, with lavish costumes and fabulous sets, this is the kind of movie that will warm your hearts till the very end.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|I recently saw Miss Potter and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The biography of Miss Beatix Potter, author of Peter Rabbit and many other children's stories, is brilliantly executed by Renee Zellweger.      The story of her life, her writing and her drawings - which become animated at times throughout the film - is captured beautifully by Zellweger.      A fiercely independent woman, who is still residing with her parents, she has created a few note worthy stories and magnificent illustrations for them.  She is approached by two gentlemen brothers (Ewan McGregor who is one of them), in the publishing business.  As her stories become quite successful, the film deals with Miss Potter dealing with her newfound success and the relationship that flourishes between her and McGregor.      Great characterization by Zellweger, idyllic settings, a great musical score and superb acting makes MISS POTTER an instant hit in my book!  Enjoy!

B001R4MEYS|4.0|Mastodon takes a leap of faith with this one. This is their most radio friendly commercially accessible release to date. Almost all the vocals are clean and clear. The song \\"the last baron\\" has some major King Krimson-like progginess but most other songs are straightforward in the Mastodon way of thinking. The concept album story line is very cool with subject matter regarding astral travel , Rasputin and lots of other things. Very musically adventerous but I can see some old fans being disappointed. It took me a few listens to fully wrap my head around it. Guitar parts are still heavy and crushing though they don't seem quite as enveloping as past classics like 'march of tthe fire ants\\".<br />I also named this as a pun on Metallica since the dvd could be called \\"some kind of Mastodon\\" in a way. Brann & Brett reveal very personal things regarding the death of Brann's sister & Brett getting pummelled to near death from members of SOAD that left him near death and laid up for a while. Very intimate things for a metal band and most would not have the courage to wear their heart on sleeve the way they do.<br />I say check it out - old fans may dig the new style and new fans will probably embrace the 'no screaming/clear vocals' type of thing. I like it more each time I listen to it.<br />Also - this cd is still very riff-oriented and completely shreds compared to most of the crap put out these days. mastodon has shown their Tool and Ozzy influences on this new one and it hasn't left my car stereo for about a week now. brann's drumming has fantastic moments to it as usual.
0739366408|3.0|I am not the writer that Max Brooks is, so please forgive the brevity of my review. I had read so many positive reviews about this book in a genre, zombie fiction, that I have only been reading for a short period of time, that I had to give it a go. I chose the audiobook over the paperback because I have a two hour one way drive to work. That being said, I have to admit I was let down. As many have said before me, Max Brooks is a very capable writer. So good that he earned the three star rating from me on that fact alone. The book definately offers a different view to the zombie war, and let's face it, every zombie book offers the story of a war against zombies. My problem with the book is that it is a \\"HISTORY\\" book of the war. After my first ninety minutes into the book I realized I had made a very wise choice to get the audiobook over the paperback, because I know that if I had read as far as I had listened I would have put the book down and never picked it up again. Being a \\"history\\" book it is very dry and \\"factual\\". It is not that I do not enjoy a history book when I pick one up, it is that when I pick up a zombie book I expect more zombie action and less factual history recitation. I am obviously in the minority on my rating of the book, but I feel what I have written is a point that all the positive reviews fail to elaborate on. Don't let my review totally keep you from reading the book or maybe listening to the audiobook if you are interested in the book at all. Just keep in mind that when you start it, the book is not zombie horror, zombie action, zombie comedy, or zombie love story. It is a dry zombie HISTORY book lacking any real elements of the other possibilities I just mentioned.
B000Z8GZYW|4.0|I happen to find Bill Murray utterly hysterical, when he's in the right movie.  If he is not in the right film I find him excruciating.  While I can't say that `Groundhog Day' is a completely realized concept (there was so much more that could have been done here) I can honestly say that Murray's transformation as Phil Connors is a completely realized performance.  He is quite possibly at his very best here (his `Lost in Translation' stint is still his finest work to date) and evokes enough human feeling to make Phil a very real, a very relatable and in the end a very honest portrait of the average American male.<br /><br />The film focuses on Phil, a weatherman for a Pittsburgh news station who has to travel to Punxatawney to cover Groundhog Day, when Punxatawney Phil comes out to see his shadow.  Phil is a cynical mess who loathes his life and his stagnant attitude towards those around him makes him somewhat of a bother.  No one wants him around and he doesn't really want anyone else around either.  When Phil, his producer Rita and their cameraman Larry find themselves trapped in Punxatawney during a blizzard it seems as though their trip couldn't get any worse, but for Phil it was just about to hit the fan.  Phil wakes up the next morning to find out that it is yesterday, Groundhog Day, yet again.<br /><br />Talk about Deja vu.<br /><br />What's worse is that the next morning it happens again; and again and again.  So what would you do if you could relive the same day over and over without any consequences or repercussions.  Phil at first begins to use it for his own selfish gain (learning about pretty women so as to seduce them) which only leads to his own self hatred and thus moves him to attempt unsuccessful suicides; but when Phil finally realizes that this could all serve to make him a better more fulfilled person things start to change and the cynical mess he used to be begins to strip itself away to reveal a kinder more human side to him.<br /><br />Really, `Groundhog Day' is about taking advantage of the chances we have for self improvement.  There are two types of selfishness; the malicious and self-congratulating kind that only leads to hurt feelings and loneliness; and then there is the kind that leads to self betterment and awareness.  Phil learns to differentiate between the two, becoming selfish for his own good; learning to love himself and thus become a better more fulfilled human being.<br /><br />Murray is phenomenal here, and he needs to be since he is in every scene practically and this he carries this entire film.  His comedic timing is priceless, but it is the warmth he brings to his character; the tragic realism he gives Phil that makes his so much more relatable.  I wish they had cast someone other than Andie MacDowell though.  I find her dreadfully boring most times, and here she fails to really make Rita someone we would fall in love with.  She pretty much plays the same character she did in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' except we see much more of her here, which strips away the mystery that surrounded her equally boring yet much more intriguing character in `Four Weddings' and leaves us with a dreadfully uninteresting creation.<br /><br />I do wish that this film had taken a different direction as far as genre is concerned, because it has all the makings for an intelligent adult character study, along the lines of say `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' or even Murray's own `Lost in Translation'; but instead, targeting a younger audience, the film winds up feeling like a standard comedy a lot of the time, which takes away from the promise of the premise.  It isn't a bad film AT ALL, but there is potential here for a much deeper and much more meaningful film.  Regardless, it is still a film to see, and Murray gives an Oscar worthy performance as the man we all may end up being if we don't learn now how to find fulfillment.ing advantage of the chances we have for self improvement.

B0001AVZA8|4.0|A smart and often very funny movie about love on the back nine of life. It's different than the love of youth, and better, I think: The romance is just as sweet, but richer, with a lifetime of experience swirled around in it.<br /><br />This is a thoughtful and--not a word I'd usually use, but perfect in this case--delightful movie. Jack is indeed his own type, as the movie makes note, which makes this a role seemingly written for him, playing a legendary Lothario forced to consider what he's missed and missing in such a life. A gutsy role for Nicholson, if you think about it, but because he's Jack, you don't. (Well, until later, obviously.)<br /><br />Diane Keaton's always been a background actress for me, someone who's always done good to great work, but whose films and roles have never resonated in memory for me. This one I'll remember. For me it's her best. Her candor onscreen is so real at times it's startling; she seems less to be acting than being caught on film.<br /><br />In the supporting roles, Amanda Peet continues to get better--check out Igby Goes Down for more evidence--and, because I'm a guy, prettier as well. The only false note, not surprisingly, is Keanu Reeves, whose casting is an absolute mystery to me. And as a doctor no less; Joey's Drake Remoray on Friends seems more real. I just don't get how with so many actually good (and more handsome, for that matter) actors available--Ted? The fact that he continues to be cast in roles that require him to emote just further convinces me he's a modern Rasputin.<br /><br />It's a small price to pay, though. This one's worth evening price. It's as close to genuine as today's Hollywood gets. You'll feel better for it, and actually wish you could be older and in love.
6302470021|4.0|I admit this; my love for Bond is newfound really.  Up until Daniel Craig stepped into the role my interest was minimal.  After watching Craig brilliantly convey humanity in `Casino Royale' I knew that I needed to research this classic character a little more.  Since then I've seen a few Brosnan and a few Connery, but honestly I have yet to truly tap into the legend that is James Bond.  I did however snatch this little ditty up a while back, anxious to see how they could have spoofed this story.  Having read the novel from which it stems, and of course having seen the 2006 masterpiece I really, really, really wanted to see how Sellers, Niven and Allen would handle it.<br /><br />What I found was as my title suggests; a messy, convoluted and confusing film that never failed to keep me interested.<br /><br />What `Casino Royale' has working against it is the lack of fluidity in the script.  This is an amalgam of spy spoofs here, not just a comedic rendering of Fleming's novel.  It covers many plot points from a wide array of Bond films and so it winds up feeling like an `Austin Powers' film as apposed to a strictly Bond comedy.  If you are not familiar with most of Bond's films then you may miss a lot of the jokes too, which is where I had some issues.<br /><br />In parts the film is great, and the acting on almost all parts is a joy.  Woody Allen is superb in his supporting role, and the whole finale of the film is uproarious thanks to him.  Peter Sellers is also golden as the young spy who is passed off as Bond (everyone is called Bond, which is one of the funnier yet more confusing jokes in the film).  Peter Nevin is rather uninspired here, but he's forgivable thanks to Sellers and Allen.  The cast is rather huge, and that is one thing `Casino Royale' has going for it.  Everyone involved puts on a great show, and cameos from the likes of Orson Welles are very welcome and very rewarding.<br /><br />In the end I can't say that this is a perfect comedy, but it tries hard and at times it is marvelous.  The scenes that work well work extremely well and they help make up for the scenes in between that drag on or fail to excite.  Regardless, the film is mostly entertaining.  I personally found myself intrigued and engrossed throughout; for by the time my interest starts to wane something funny happens and my interest is taken hold of yet again.<br /><br />It's worth it, especially if you are a Bond enthusiast.us.

B000WGWQG8|3.0|I'm clearly in the minority on this, but as much as I loved McCullough's book--I was already a fan of Adams from the Adams/Jefferson letters that I'd read--and as much as I wanted then to like this series--I just couldn't. It turned me off so much, in fact, I couldn't even finish it. The Adams in the HBO series just isn't the Adams I've come to know in McCullough's book, the Adams/Jefferson letters, and John/Abigail letters. Some of it is there, certainly, but Giamatti's performance is uniformly petulant, irritable, and whiny. I'm reminded of Dorothy Parker's criticism of Katherine Hepburn: \\"She ran the whole gamut of emotions from A to B.\\" Adams certainly could be all three, but was clearly so much more--a more vital, gravitational personality--and you'll never see it--indeed, get even a glimpse of it--in HBO's John Adams. While in an obviously frothier vein, Bill Daniels' forceful portrayal of Adams in the film adaptation of the musical 1776 is far truer to the man described in the book and letters. He, at least, could convincingly be the Adams described by his peers and the match for Abigail, which was never the case for me with Giamatti's shrinking whiner. When he is supposed to be forceful, he merely comes off as a brat. At no point during the HBO series could I bring myself to believe that it was Giamatti's Adams that the other characters were talking about. He simply wasn't believable to me, to the extent that I simply couldn't watch him anymore. I had to retrieve the book and letters from my bookshelf to cleanse my palate and revisit the man of his words.<br /><br />Which is a criticism I have of the writing itself. Such work in a supposedly epic telling, and yet again I find a much more understandable presentation of Adams in the film 1776 than in four hours (so far) of HBO's production. After four episodes I still couldn't perceive a coherent philosophy, and challenge anyone watching it cold to produce one. The production spent far too much time on the minutiae of moments at the expense of a clear depiction of the man himself. Ultimately it was all about emotions--and again, only a couple of them--rather than thoughts. But then this is modern Hollywood's obsession--excessive but ultimately superficial verisimilitude--which is why its characterizations pale in comparison to the best of the past.<br /><br />The same problem extends to the production itself. There is a fanatical attention to detail, including superb visual and special effects, but once again at the expense of the story. Rather than simply putting a camera on an actor and letting him act, Adams' director Tom Hooper, like so many of his peers, feels he must \\"put us in the moment\\" with hand-held camera work and oblique camera angles, or create an interesting canvas through off-center compositions and muted colors. All he does instead is distract the viewer and draw attention to himself instead of the characters. Oh but for the chance to lock the present generation of directors in a room playing Ford, Huston, Hawks, and Wyler movies non-stop until they finally learn what they clearly never have about storytelling.<br /><br />I am happy, actually, that so many have enjoyed this series so much, but it's more than disappointing--aggravating--that the John Adams they're given is such a feral dog compared to the force of nature and penetrating mind, vain, stubborn, and obnoxious as it is, that comes through his letters.moments at the expense of a clear depiction of the man himself.

076781214X|3.0|Nothing more than lightweight Coppola; at times `Peggy Sue Got Married' can be a little too light.  It doesn't mean that this is a total waste of time (the lead performance by Kathleen Turner is a gem and deserved that Oscar nomination it was handed) but to say that this is a great comedy is stretching it a bit thin.  Maybe that's the real problem.<br /><br />The film itself is a bit thin.<br /><br />The film opens with Peggy Sue Bodell going to her 25 year High School reunion fresh off her split from high school sweetheart Charlie Bodell.  He cheated and treated her badly and so, with a divorce in the wings, she attends her reunion with her daughter hoping to have a good time and forget about him for the evening, but everything reminds her of her past and soon she is overwhelmed with anxiety.<br /><br />Then she faints and wakes up a teenager again, back in high school with the chance to do it all over.<br /><br />The main issue I have is with the script, which doesn't really seem to have a point.  Sure, it is supposed to give Peggy a chance to decide if she really wants to live the life she picked for herself, but really; her end decision makes the whole film null and void in my opinion.  There just seems to be no real progression of character.  Peggy keeps telling others that she is an adult with life experiences and thus she can make a more informed decision now about how she should have lived her life; but she never makes that informed decision.  Regardless though, Kathleen Turner sells it gloriously.  We believe her, even if the script does not.  She is hilarious and honest throughout, capturing the innocence of childhood with the towering knowledge of adulthood.  You can feel the weight of the truth on her shoulders yet she manages to mask it with the carelessness of someone experiencing life for the first time.<br /><br />If it wasn't for Turner I would have turned this off.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage is not an actor I like.  I think he was amazing in three films (count em'...1, 2, 3) and I think he has single-handedly destroyed every other movie he's walked onto.  This is not really an exception.  He actually gives a decent performance, but his performance is so overly annoying that he makes it hard to pay attention.  I think my wife described him as `disgusting' here and I somewhat have to agree.<br /><br />Look out for a slew of familiar faces, all before they became really familiar.  Aside from Turner and Cage there is screen goddess Joan Allen in a small role as Peggy's friend Maddy, as well as Jim Carry who plays Charlie's friend Walter and even Sophia Coppola (amazing director, horrible actress) plays Peggy's kid sister.<br /><br />In the end I say, watch the movie for Turner.  It's lightweight fare that can be entertaining, and some of the dialog is witty and fresh, but don't expect anything remotely profound (which is sad because it had the promise to be really smart).single-handedly destroyed every other movie he's walked onto.

B001PPLIFU|2.0|The film is overpaced, to kinetic and without a worthy storyline. How long can James Bond continue to the be the rogue agent until some one uses their 00 license on him? Yes, I got the message in the previous and much superior Casino Royale. The bad guys are boring, there are no good gadgets, and the plot is ::yawn:: boring. Think of this sophomore outing as comparable to the Matrix 2 for letting the fans down.
0811729117|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, to hear from the veteran, his own story, is enlightning. One can sense the bitterness that underlies the fact of losing after trying so hard and paying such a high price to win. We need to hear more such stories before they are all gone, historians can paint the picture however they like but nothing beats the mark 1 eyeball. Some nice pictures and a very good read.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This has got to be one of the most Anti Jewish films of all time.  I am surprised it has a much success as it has after the holocaust.  It really is sad, and does not give justice to the historical understanding the Jesus was crucified by Rome because he challenged the Caesar, who at that time, was considered the Son of God!  I think it is time we got the story right and put the blame where it belongs, rampant imperialism.
0618154051|5.0|Although the tales are, of course, unfinished, they are interesting nonetheless, and provide a lot more detail and new perspectives on events that may have only been briefly touched upon.  If you just read the Lord of the Rings and have no idea what the Silmarillion is, this may not be the book for you.  However, if the Appendices of LOTR left you wanting more, pick this one up.
B001OBT3FC|4.0|This is my first blu-ray classical music disc and the picture is stunning.  The performance (Orchestra, soloist and conductor) is also of the highest quality. I have two issues with this disc  1- The sound (in stereo) is good but not in the same league with the picture and performance  2- the bonus material about Karajan cannot be approached (as the other reviewer said)
B000WGWQG8|1.0|The movie was entertaining, though I question the validity of some of the events and situations that were depicted.   I didn't feel like the founding fathers were treated respectfully by the writers.  My main objection, however, is the unnecessary (and I believe inaccurate) full frontal nudity in the tar and feathering scene.  And the lengthy, and again very unnecessary, woman's breast scene at the end.  I feel it was a thinly-veiled appeal to HBO's baser audience and ruins an otherwise O.K. movie.
0316168815|4.0|This book receives a rating of **** stars for three reasons. I liked the idea of the book, I connected with the main character and its sends out a good message. The idea of the book is rare, it takes place in heaven with the main character but she is watching her family on earth. Susie, the main character is a normal teenage girl. The message of this book is to always trust your instincts. Over all this was a great book and I recommend it for any teenage girl.
0060090383|5.0|Marian Keyes is such a wonderful writer, I believe I could read a grocery list she'd written and find it both funny and moving.<br /><br />In \\"Rachel's Holiday,\\" I think Marian Keyes has done some of her best work. The book is hilariously funny, as all of Keyes' stories tend to be, but it is also serious and very wrenching in parts. A reader can watch Rachel go through all the stages of confronting her addiction, the reactions of her family and friends, and Rachel's efforts to get her feet under her after her \\"vacation\\" is over.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book both as an entertaining story, plus an inside look at how treatment centers and counseling work to help people truly look at their lives so that they can overcome their addictions.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|Okay, so call me old fashioned, call me cliche, call me vapid, but I really, really love The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Damn all those who say its Forrest Gump 2.0, damn those who say its too long, damn everyone who thinks its overly shamltzy, I think its a great film and one of the best fantasy films since LOTR.<br /><br />The story tells of Benjamin Button, who by some weird twist of fate, was born with the body of an old man and as he gets older, he ages backwards. We are then taken on his life and all his life adventures, from growing up in an old folks home with his adoptive mother Queenie, spending his early adult life as a sea boater, and coming back to America for his childhood friend and love interest Daisy.<br /><br />I think I speak for everyone that the film is gorgeously made, considering it did pick up three Oscars for many of its technical aspects, the set pieces evoking the time period, the cinematography rich, art direction meticulous, and of course, those special effects, those awesome special effects that transform the handsome Brad Pitt from an old man to a spiting image of Brad the first time we saw him in Thelma & Louise.<br /><br />Now unlike many, I actually thought Button was that film that didn't feel long. At nearly three hours, you would expect this to be true but for me, the film really just glided along and the pacing was so effortless, it was like I was transported to another world, something I haven't experienced since, ironically, LOTR.<br /><br />This mostly has to do with Fincher, known for his dark, sinster films like Seven and Zodiac. Leaving behind all that for a more lighter fair, you can still detect his touches in the film. After all, this film is essentally about life and death, Benjamin slowly aging backwards, his life in reverse, watching as the world changes while he seems to be going further and further into the past, all leading towards that time when he will eventually die. And I for one think Fincher keeps things from getting to shmaltzy, giving the film a heart but not such a ooey, gooey center that feels too sweet.<br /><br />Each actor also brings life to their performance. Brad Pitt is able to act through all that make up and effects to deliver a very sturdy and calm performance, something I think that many would have think was way to subtle in order to pull of the effects, but I think it works, he dosen't try too hard to make it a good performance, he just does. Taraji P. Henson was a very nice surprise as Benjamin's adoptive mom Queenie, giving both wit, charm, and personality, but once again, keeping it from becoming too stereotyped or cliche. And as always, Cate Blanchett is as a great as ever (still very shocked she was ignored through out the awards season).<br /><br />Honestly, I think Benjamin Button is one of those films that you either love it or hate it. For me, I fall into the love it catagory, and you know what? I'm proud off it. Whether or not you like Brad Pitt, or don't life fantasy films, or just turned off by some of the lukewarm reviews, give Button a chance. Maybe you'll hate it, maybe you'll be indifferent, but if your like me, you'll find a very rich, thoughtfull, and heart tugging film that is that true Hollywood experience.ng the film a heart but not such a ooey, gooey center that feels too sweet.

B001B0AY68|5.0|Jeff has no idea what he is talking about. I agree that Amazon should not pay him to write reviews for movies that he obviously knows nothing about. The acting in this was nothing short of brilliant as was the imagery if I may commend the cast and Mr. Gilliam. Depp was dead on as Hunter if you've ever seen any footage of the real man. This is by far my all time favorite film for the story, the directing, the acting and the passion surrounding it.     One other thing. For the swine complaining about DVD's purchsed from Amazon that didn't work and began bashing Amazon....do you really think that Amazon is making these DVD's? Think about that for a while and get back to me. Jesus, did I say that? Was I talking? Did they hear me?     plaidanxiety
B001NOMNZW|4.0|The High School Musical series of films is one of those magnificent rarities that has polarized a large segment of society. Many people love it ... and many people hate it. This third installment clearly has the best production values and is very entertaining. For my money it is the best of the three. The choreography in particular is excellent. The songs are fun and reasonably well performed. I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 because this is a product review and the Blu-ray video is stunning and the sound is excellent. The inclusion of a standard DVD to accompany the Blu-ray is a nice touch for families. Kids can play the regular DVD to death. If the film itself were a timeless classic I would give it a 5. It is still a good film. If you like wholesome, innocent fun with a first-rate presentation, you will enjoy this.
B00005JPY2|3.0|My two cents:<br />A big 4-4.5 star treat for the fans of the book and a confusing, fairly bizarre, yet visually striking (not thinking of the blue ---- but that too) original film for everyone else.<br /><br />The overall look of this comic book movie is fantastic. There are brilliant moments that linger in your mind well after leaving the theater. The casting seems fine. I've not heard whatever complaints there were from the fanboys, if any. The screenplay is flawed. Though, I have no idea how it could have been better and still remained as dedicated to the source material. Couldn't things have moved along at a better pace (for non-fans too)? Well, for my part, well over an hour-maybe hour and a half- into this and it still felt like things were just starting. As for the plot, it's absurd. There are maybe one or two maybe three \\"good guys\\" but they can't make a difference, can they? And they all have problems. If you think something good or at least necessary was done at the end, you are morally lost my friend. I'm glad in our universe we don't have and do not need superheroes, especially ones like these. I hope.
B0013D8LOU|4.0|Exactly that:  I found myself shedding some tears -- Sweeney Todd is definitely a tragedy!    I was especially touched by when Sweeney realizes whom the Blonde Woman really is!  That poor man!    There are some interesting traits in the other characters, too (especially the young, innocent characters -- what might they become in their futures?) -- but to me, it's all about the tortured Sondheim version of the Demon Barber -- and how he Became such a demon.    Four stars, although the violence is very disturbing.
0312383320|5.0|Wow, I wasn't expecting to enjoy this installment of the Plum series as much as I did, what a happy surprise. Although, I will state that I enjoyed Fearless Fourteen a lot more than many fans have, indicating that I maybe burnt out and got annoyed with the Plum series earlier on than others (the breaking point for me was Book 11 or 12), and then slowly limped back to the series at around the time that other fans are getting disgusted. Fearless Fourteen was more like the Plum books that I like best, and Plum Spooky sort of echoes that. I thought I was done with the Plum books for good--but I can never seem to stay away, and I am glad I checked this book out.     The good: Lula and Tank, yay! I LOVED Tank's revelations in this book, I thought they were actually good for his character development and made me enjoy him a great deal. Pretty good for a character who only gets about one line of dialogue per book. And Lula was fun, as always, if a little forced. This time around she's into having her \\"numbers\\" done, and consults with a psychic/astrologist. Fun.     Also, Stephanie, if I recall correctly, isn't as incompetent as she has been and actually gets out of a bad scrape on her own, instead of needing to be rescued. I admired her smarts and her determination in this book.     The bad: The book zips along, but I wasn't compelled to read it in one sitting, like I used to be. I read this off and on over a week. It just didn't have much juice, much energy. I don't know what the difference is between the zaniness of previous books and this, since they have the same writing style and the same plot elements and basically the same antics, but it does feel less high-octane, more sleepy. Maybe the fact that this book does use the same writing style, the same basic elements, the same basic antics is what makes it so sleepy: there's not much here that is fresh. Come on. No more destroyed cars, PLEASE. No more zany family dinners where something zany happens in a zany way, PLEASE.     I finishes the book yesterday and already I can't really remember a lot of the book. I think the fact that much of it is recycled from the rest of the series might be the cause.     Also, Diesel kind of turned me off in this story. I think what was supposed to read as flirtatious ended up reading as jerk behavior. Too bad.     The hugely improved: Steph no longer makes me want to stab myself repeatedly with a toasting fork whenever she cheats on Morelli/does something mind-bogglingly stupid/blows up a car/lets the bad guy escape again/etc. Wonderful progress! Wonderful!     My wishes for the next book: actual character development, fresh material. It's sad when TANK is the character who grows the most in a story, and he's not even a secondary character. Sheesh. Lula also seems to change and, if not grow, then at least not stagnate, with her wedding plans and her new interests and hobbies. Maybe Stephanie, Ranger, and Morelli can be allowed to do the same?  Still, having the secondary characters doing new things does keep the story feeling alive, so having Grandma Mazur get salsa lessons or Stephanie's mother start taking art classes or train to be a nurse or Stephanie's father doing something interesting might go a long way toward making the books fun and dynamic again. Then again, sometimes the new things Grandma Mazur or Lula, etc., do in each book seem limp and forced.     Recommendation: if you're heavily invested in the romantic dynamic of Stephanie and Ranger, this book will probably disappoint or annoy you. You can skip it without worries. If you're heavily invested in the romantic dynamic of Stephanie and Morelli, there's a little bit here, but not much. If you just want a fun, light read, this book should do the trick. And if you want to be rid of this series but just can't seem to break the habit, then you have my sympathies, and hey, you might be pleasantly surprised.
0374531269|4.0|Ishmael Beah.  A child soldier.  Sierra Leone, Africa, early 1990s, a country lacerated by civil war.  This is the testimony of a child whose parents and siblings were killed. Life in his native village had been simple and carefree until then. Roaming endlessly through the forests with some equally unlucky children, all young, alone, afraid and uncomprehending, trying to escape the violence that changed their life in a matter of seconds, they all ended up being caught, recruited, brainwashed and turned into soldiers.  They were drugged heavily to endure what they were told to do.  And they did it.  Lack of obedience meant sure death.   Ishmael Beah managed to survive. After a couple of years in the inferno, he was chosen to be part of a rehabilitation program and later on fate landed him in the USA.     The book, written in the following years, delivers the account utilizing the language of a child his age (at the time, he was 13).  I have the feeling that some parts were omitted here and there (even if some graphically vicious and disturbing scenes were described), but this was probably done to define a line between seeking the sordid and getting to the gist of the matter, delivered through the voice of a child: condemning the atrocity of war recruiting innocent children and turning them into drugged up soldiers. A painfully sharp book.  Heartbreaking.
0765310015|5.0|Think Robert Jordan Crossed with George Martin. Super complex, and interesting, plot.  Yes there are thing you may not understand at first, but that is on purpose, the characters don't understand either. As the series progresses the reader and the characters both learn more and more. Don't miss this.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|In the realm of horror movies there is no paucity of lame, shallow, gratuitously violent flicks with characters acting so dumbly and irrationally as if they are racing to win the next Darwin's Award.. but I have got to say Martyrs manage to redefine the word \\"lame movie\\".<br />You have it all at the nth power.. victims with the common sense of a moth, blood splashing everywhere, assorted torture for every taste... and what makes it all the more irritating is the totally irrelevant, lame , dumb motivation for it all. I will just say one thing to the poor ignorant sadistic chap who came up with the brilliant idea for this movie: martyr means witness because it originally meant just that, a witness in a trial, and later also a witness of the faith or cause in which he believes. It has nothing to do whatsoever with witnessing life after death. Please, stop abusing culture  and history  besides sheer common sense).
B001PPLIEG|1.0|From what was considered the peak in the Bond Franchise with Casino Royale comes this clumsily, ill-directed piece of tripe that is absolutely one of the low points of the entire Bond franchise. Never before has a franchise been raised to its highest levels and then come crashing down to its lowest possible descent. The action scenes are totally confusing and incomprehensible, leaving you frustrated instead of excited and breathless. The main Bond girl is a rather dour affair, not particularly attractive or sexy, and actually just frumpy. And the villian is a wimpy milktoast eurotrash that you don't particularly fear or care what happens to him in the end. It's an extremely pathetic and depressing affair, filled with stale dialogue and a very weak plot. Director Marc Forster should be shot point blank for ruining this franchise.
B001PPLIFU|1.0|The action sequences were way too choppy.  I don't think they stayed on one shot for more than a second.  It was extremely hard to tell what the heck was going on.     Also, it wasn't very Bond-like.  Was his theme music even played before the end of the movie?  I loved all the other bond movies, but I don't think this will find a permanent place in my video library.

0060760273|5.0|This was my 4 year old and is my 2 year old's favorite book (the older one now likes Green Eggs and Ham). I just ordered this version with the bunny, and I can't wait to get it! This is the third book we will have gotten, as the first two were read so many times that they each wore out (even though the second was the board book lol). There's a cute video by HBO that is Goodnight Moon and other bedtime stories like Nightmare in My Closet, and Tar Beach. My kids love the video too. Great, great story.
B00197POXG|5.0|I am very satisfied with the complete series. As did other people who reviewed this set, I noticed that sometimes the DVD's voices would be out of sync, but like others wrote, all I had to do was eject it and put it back in. I also noticed that the DVD's played better on older DVD players, it wasn't as clear or smooth on the newer DVD players. I was very satisfied with the price, and I absolutely LOVE the series and love being able to share it with my children!
1400082773|5.0|Forgetting for a moment who wrote this book; this is an engaging, thoughtful, intelligent, perceptive read. This is a real meditation on race and specifically, on what it means to grow up and search for one's racial identity in modern America. And yet, it is beautifully written. Rich in descriptive detail and almost novelistic vignettes, it is also pacey and hard to put down.     Returning to the author, it is truly hard to believe that this was written by a politician (although he wasn't at the time of writing). It is such a good read and provides such a thoughtful and open account of Obama's views and experiences, that it is truly breathtaking in this age of political posturing.     Read this to learn more about Obama. Read this to learn more about the divisions of America. Read this to learn about the black experience both in the US and in Kenya. Read this for the beauty of its writing, but above all, read it, you won't be disappointed.
B000EXZI0A|3.0|The Ramones are an acquired taste and in many ways you either love them or you hate them. Ironically however I'm sort of in the middle. There's a lot of their grungier, punkier songs that just don't do it for me but just about every one of their songs that I do like is on this album and I even found a few new ones that I enjoyed. Out of the 20 tracks on the album there's about 8 or 9 that I like and that's enough to justify buying it for me. It's not particularly expensive like some huge Greatest Hits compilations so it really was a painless purchase on my end.    I won't pretend to know much about the technical side of things but all the tracks sound fine to me and the CD played well out of the case. That's all the production value I really care about.    Good enough for this casual fan. Die hard fans might have a different opinion but if you're like me and there's a handful of Ramone songs you enjoy then chances are they're on this album.
B000002H5I|5.0|March 25, 2009,<br />Jay Leno and his producers tend to favor Adult Alternative bands or similar individual artists for the final few minutes. I think this is a smart move because this genre is where you will find the better musicians and recording artists that are singer songwriters. Tonight's set featured what apparently was described as an indie band. The group consisted of maybe eight players all in varied garb somehow meshing inexplicably into a credible color scheme. They went right into Tracy Chapman's Talkin Bout a Revolution and although I was surprised to hear Tracy's memorable song from this explosive and much loved debut album covered as such,it was not a bad cover. The indie band did a great job but there is no singer songwriter quite like Tracy Chapman. I started listening to her signature song Fast Car which is on this album back in 1988 and even today it is so good that it is addictive. Baby Can I Hold You never stays in the case either. Music critics in 1988 thought protest music when they evaluated Tracy Chapman but I have to say she never impressed me as being insistent or aggressive about things. I was so taken aback by her strikingly beautiful material and vocals that I just considered her to be a moving and evocative singer songwriter. It's funny but I have this album on a cassette and I happen to own a Walkman. So I hook up the player to a sub woofer and shoot Tracy's music through portable speakers. I go through all that trouble when I want to hear some fine music on an old media and Tracy Chapman is more than worth it. Purchasing Tracy Chapman I think with no thought to her debut music not being current will complement your library to the highest level of excellence. I do not know if she is touring this summer but if she comes to Jones Beach I'm there early.<br /><br />Jay Adler, Music Critic
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Mastodon have really surged forward with this new release.  This is at once their most creative and vast music, and also their most accessible.  The vocals are mostly clean (but extremely intense, in the best of all possible ways) and the guitars are woven into a thick screaming psychedelic tapestry.  This is a concept album about leaving the spiritual ties of earth into outer space and returning to earth (through a \\"Crack in the Skye\\") to late 1800's Czarist Russia, during the time of Rasputin.  G-rrr-ooovy!  Understanding the plot is in no way a requisite to enjoying the mindblowing music and lyrics!  This is Mastodon's greatest work, so far.  Check it out or severely miss out on the year's greatest album.
B001974DG0|5.0|I read this book when I was 13 or 14.  It felt like I was watching a movie.  Great read.
B001PPGAIA|1.0|The 1*s are right this is a bad movie.  Hugh Jackman, was the only watchable character and I really like him, but I wouldn't watch it again even for him. I was told that the first 20 minutes were disjointed, but stick with it.  Well only have of that statement was true, it isn't just the first 20 minutes it is the whole thing.  White people bad aborigines good.  It feels like the producers took parts from several movies such as Dancing with Wolves and Far and Away combined them and set it in Australia. The scenery maybe beautiful but it looks like most of it was constructed on a computer.  Nicole Kidman is wooden and boring and the other characters are just that, other characters.  Don't worry, you have seen them before over and over and over again.  Even the soundtrack is an uninspiring rip-off.  I would choose the Man From Snowy River hands down to this over produced self indulgent film.
B001FBSMF8|3.0|BUT there are also some really interesting things in it. As an experiment I give it 3-stars... as an album it probably deserves much less. On every track, Chris' voice seems to be struggling to rise above Timbaland's beats... sometimes it succeeds as in \\"Long Gone\\" and sometimes it fails completely as in \\"Part of Me\\", which would be a fantastic rock song on its own without all the Cher additives. I saw Chris perform this album at HOB in Hollywood in October '08. It was MUCH better live. The final product is too overwrought and overproduced. I had to permanently delete a few tracks from my iPod... BUT, I love Chris Cornell and give him a lot of props for taking a risk by doing something unexpected... it'll probably make his NEXT album really stellar.
B000FVQLQQ|2.0|What is \\"beautiful\\" about the mind here?  You're introduced to under-Prof Krunkhead (Crowe) as an egotistical jerk.  But then somehow, maybe when you realize he be all crazy, you are supposed to think, gee, despite the fact that he's still a jerk, now I believe his mind is beautiful.  It probably doesn't help that Crowe is an egotistical jerk, but still, at what point were my sympathies supposed to swing over to this character?  Somehow he wins over all his college chums, despite treating them like stinky cheese - I'd like to know why.  And then there's his oh-so-cute proposal of sexual congress to Jen-Con, whose heart and nethers melt at his boldness - cuz she can see through to his mind - his B-YOOOOO-T-FUL mind.  Which just happens to be crawling with spiders but still...    Speaking of Jen-Con, this is yet another faceless placement of her pretty face.  Jen-Con role #2132.  It's as if she peaked immediately with \\"Labyrinth\\", because that's the only distinct part I can remember her in.  And even that is a bit fuzzy.  But I especially like the moment when she gets to ACT by smashing up her bathroom cuz Beautiful Mind will have to wait a few decades for blue pills to counter his thorazine.  And then Bowie pops out I believe - it's hazy.    The sad thing is that Pretty Brain's psychosis is way more interesting than anything about the movie's real world.  Continue the plot line about Ed Harris and his suitcase atomic bomb and I'd be right there with ya.  Of course then the movie couldn't be considered serious and win serious awards and be taken seriously by serious people.  Oh, and I guess the fact that it's a true story hurts...although how are we to know what is true and what is an illusion?  Breathe deep the gathering gloom already.    Which brings me to the true breaking point, which might also be true to life, I'm too indifferent to look it up.  That is when Sexy Head gets his Nobel Prize for something he did 50 years ago and makes a horribly sappy mawkish reference to \\"only love\\" something something.  Seriously, I'm not sure I heard it cuz my head was exploding.  I'd rather he thanked his imaginary friend and his niece while revealing that Ed Harris was real all along and the suitcase bomb was in that VERY ROOM and the call was coming from inside the house and...  ANYTHING but bringing that tripe about love in.  Perhaps he should have repeated his straight-forward proposal of copulation which won him the lovely Jen-Con.    I only wish I'd been paying attention to movies when this won the Academy Award (C) so that I could listen to the sort of pretentious jerks who ran out and learned everything they could about his Blonde-Poking economic theory and exposited on its brilliance while also jawing on about the brilliance of this film and Crowe's brilliance (did he even break a sweat?) and so on.  Oh the beautiful minds.
0307269981|5.0|Being a hungry enthusiastic for thrillers, after finishing the great Volume I on the Millennium Trilogy, I, as some of the reviewers displayed on the AMAZON US site, could not wait for the US print on the follow up masterpiece from Stieg Larsson- The Girl who played with Fire- and purchase the UK edition.<br />I might not be a \\"hard reader\\" - I read 5 to 10 books a year, but because of this limited time I have for this purpose, I try to be really selective, and believe me, if you are looking for a page-turner, all niter excellent novel, this is the book for you.<br />In my opinion, a good novel has to have several elements to be successful, and Larsson achieves this flawlessly. Good story-telling, simple (at first glance) yet complicated characters, and an \\"out-of- the-ordinary\\" plot.  If a novel has these 3 elements on a decent scale, I am caught!<br />In the first installment of this trilogy- The girl with the dragon tattoo- you only begin to know the main characters, Mikael Bloomkist and Lisbeth Salander, and you just have to love the great persona and profile put on both of them.<br />I am a fan of the Camel Club series by David Baldacci, and I found out a lot of similarities on the \\"slow-but-constant\\" development and knowledge of \\"Oliver Stone\\"- the main character on Baldacci's novels- as well as Lisbeth Salander. These are enigmatic and sometimes surprising characters, but Larsson, as well as Baldacci, know very well the tempo and extension of their creations, therefore a delightful and even-better-than-the-original delivery of a great series. I can hardly wait for the conclusion of this masterpiece. This is a MUST HAVE if you are a thriller aficionado.
B001UOVP1S|3.0|BUT there are also some really interesting things in it. As an experiment I give it 3-stars... as an album it probably deserves much less. On every track, Chris' voice seems to be struggling to rise above Timbaland's beats... sometimes it succeeds as in \\"Long Gone\\" and sometimes it fails completely as in \\"Part of Me\\", which would be a fantastic rock song on its own without all the Cher additives. I saw Chris perform this album at HOB in Hollywood in October '08. It was MUCH better live. The final product is too overwrought and overproduced. I had to permanently delete a few tracks from my iPod... BUT, I love Chris Cornell and give him a lot of props for taking a risk by doing something unexpected... it'll probably make his NEXT album really stellar.
B000002UA5|3.0|It was the spring of 2001 at my friend's house and the first thing I hear upon opening my eyes is a strange mishmash of screetching, scared and angry animals and thumping, followed by some raving Scotsman. I groggily sit up in my sleeping bag and ask, \\"What the hell is that?\\"<br /><br />Thus was my introduction to early Pink Floyd. Before this, I had only heard Dark Side of the Moon and a handful of radio hits. Never before could I imagine a band doing something so weird, so trippy, so...funny, as \\"Several Species...\\"<br /><br />As far as Pink Floyd goes, this is the album that seperates the boys from the men when it comes to spaced-out, bizarre, psychedelic rock. If this is just \\"noise\\" to you, then keep on listening to Dark Side and the later stuff. Me, I like it all, and when I'm in the mood for some woozy, weird stuff, I'll put this on my MP3 player and go for a walk.<br /><br />As on later efforts, Waters and Gilmour remain the primary focus as far as quality goes, with \\"Granchester Meadows\\" and \\"The Narrow Way\\" being the most palatable cuts here. Rick Wright's \\"Sysyphus\\" suite has some wonderful atonal and scary bits, and Nick Mason's splice-y drum showpiece has some impressive usage of late 60's studio technology, although they're just not quite up to par with the other pieces. I particularly like the idyllic and lush \\"Grantchester Meadows.\\" Just a simple, pretty Waters vocal and some sparse acoustic strumming, enhanced with birdsong and the sounds of a rushing creek. A perfect song to start your day, enjoying a wake 'n' bake with some coffee while sitting in the sunshine.<br /><br />Ummagumma has the interesting effect of showing where Pink Floyd's strengths and weaknesses lay at this point in their career, and brought into focus exactly what each member was contributing to the band. This album was part of the journey to Dark Side and beyond, and (like all their other '67-'72 albums) many experiments contained herein were later utilised to greater effect down the road. Therefore, one should listen with the right frame of mind, taking note of *when* it was recorded, as well as realizing that it's one of a handful of very informative timecapsules in this unique band's long journey towards The Division Bell.<br /><br />Oh, and the live disc is pretty good too.ould listen with the right frame of mind, taking note of *when* it was recorded, as well as realizing that it's one of a handful of very informative timecapsules in this unique band's long journey towards The Division Bell.    Oh, and the live disc is pretty good too.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this DVD last week and used regular shipping.  I received it a day earlier than estimated. There are three levels to the DVD.  You will only need hand weights, that can be any weight. I started on Level 1 and told myself that I will follow the person who is doing the workour full blown, just like Jillian.  There was no way I was going to just follow the moderate movements!  About two minutes into the workout I could not keep up.  This is so fast paced and wonderful! Needless to say, I finished barely being able to get off the floor to do the last three minutes.  I was following the moderate work outs the entire time.  My arms and thighs are so sore today, I feel like I just trained at a gym.  I strongly encourage this DVD! One thing that Jillian says on there over and over, is that you can not take a break during the entire 25 minutes.  There is NO WAY you can lose weight in 25 minutes with taking it slow.  She works you out hard, and this is really worth it.
B00005JMCT|3.0|With the third installment to the Pie trilogy, Jim and Michelle are tying the knot. So to help celebrate the upcoming event, they've invited out their family and friends. Yep... even Jim's friends.  Though the movie is about Jim and Michelle, it also lets Stifler and Finch shine a tad more. When Michelle's sister comes into town, the boys are immediately interested in her. Stifler though believes he has to be someone he's not to impress her, so he tries to act more polite and sophisticated. Finch on the other hand sees through his ruse and instead of acting like himself, becomes a lot more like the Stifler we have come to know (and love?).<br /><br />Eh... when I saw this in the theater, I remember laughing a good amount. Now though, I really didn't think it was that funny. There were some scenes that were just horrible and not funny at all. For example, Stifler and Jim accidently smash a `congratulations' cake onto each others pants, which then has 2 dogs licking their crotch areas, Stifler laughing, Jim trying to pull them off... and then surprise, the parents of everyone sees it. I had to swallow sadness after seeing that. Though there are plenty of good scenes to make up for it like the chocolate truffle scene.  I don't know though, this one just didn't even come close to the first 2.<br /><br />In the end, I would just give it a rent. Unless you are like me and like to be a completionist or like to laugh with American Pie even during its bad scenes. I own it!<br /><br />P.S. - I literally gagged out loud like 5 times during the chocolate truffle scene.

B000GCG59W|5.0|This woman's singing is almost indescribable..here are some attempts: spirited, soulful, emotional, if you love Latin, Brazilian, Flamenco - raspy, deep, rich vocals...this is the right choice. It was for me. She's amazing.

038533348X|3.0|Cat's Cradle is the story of a reporter chasing down the family and friends of a one of the \\"fathers\\" of the nuclear bomb. The story takes him to a impoverished remote island that has developed its own religion that everyone practices but no one admits to.  Vonnegut has a hilarious narrative style as always and goes into the fantastic and absurd by the last half of the novel. I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a quick read (especially on an airplane, since some of the best parts take place in the friendly skies). Though it isn't his best, Vonnegut doesn't provide the social commentary that something like [[ASIN:0385333471 God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]].

B001MEJY8W|5.0|Terrifyingly harrowing, sickening, hopelessly bleak, and very cruel, this French bad boy is an evil, evil film that, I promise non-believers, will utterly destroy the foundations of their pre-assumptions, biases and expectations. In that case, one should proceed with great caution in regards to viewing it. I believe Pascal Laugier, who was apparently depressed and suicidal while directing this, has achieved what could be the ultimate point of horror cinema, or any material that deals with horror for that matter: utterly dark without any single trace of snide mockery or humor, let alone a single ray of light; unflinchingly looking at human depravity, misery and cruelty by virtue of effectively capturing what could be every single pain known to mankind without any remorse and apology, and abandoning any concept of hope and redemption; indeed ugly pessimism at its finest: and doing all of that on philosophical and humanistic terms: what does it mean to be human? What does it mean to truly suffer? How does one can transcend material life? How does death look like? Is there a way to find truth? Good god, Nietzsche would be proud. With the abundance of gore along the veins of \\"Clive Barker's Hellraiser\\" (which is now understandably a film that Laugier is currently remaking) and gut-wrenching violence that is plain razor-sharp and thoroughly ugly, but that of which leaves a surprising emotional resonance and sadness on its sufferers, unlike the cold detachment from the characters in American torture porn films like the \\"Saw\\" and \\"Hostel\\" series, \\"Martyrs\\" works far differently from its aforementioned counterparts: it actually has something to say, albeit from an existential angle, and it is cathartic and emotional. Nonetheless, witnessing it is a very satanic experience, though that is the point: horror that is highly effective transgresses beyond showing superficial pain, flimsy terror, nonsensical idealism that is tired and realism that is made up of mere platitudes. In\\"Martyrs\\", every single drop of blood is significant down to its transcendental, even ethereal, moving conclusion.
B001DTUU7A|5.0|This is a light and whimsical movie. Beautifully done and the choice of actors to do the voices were superb. Although this is a children's movie the lesson learned in it is suitable for all ages.
B00122HUN0|3.0|I initially hated this album,because it was made way before my time. And has a fan of 80s pop this album really disappointed me. After listening to this album a few monthes later, and recently becoming a fan of Madonna. I found this album to be quite surprising. I initially couldn't stand the vocals, and on a few of the tracks the vocals still sound like a screeching banchee. Material Girl,Dress You Up,Over and Over. But there are a few gems on here such as Into the Groove(one of my favorite madonna songs and a classic), angel, love dont live here anymore, and pretender. I really thought Madonna sang surprisingly good on love don't live here any more. Im usually not a fan of her high pitch,but love dont live here any more was a beautiful ballad, with perhaps some of madonnas best vocal work.(thats what i listen for voice). As for Pretender had a pretty good bass synth sound.I also liked the vocal work on stay. Never have been a big fan of like a virgin,but everybodys heard of the song,and it can be catchy at times, yet annoying. The Lyrics and video are pretty clever. Overall, this album was alittle better then I thought it would be. If your a fan of 80s pop,you should give this a listen through. It's not her best,but its pretty decent. Plus her vocals might surprise you.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|On the movie portion of the disc: This movie falls into the typical realm of all-star cast to cover what is really lacking. This time around, its a plot (aka purpose). The movie takes one on a shallow ride--literally--of look-what-we-can-do graphics. It does attempt to go \\"deeper\\" plot-wise, particularly by throwing in a similarity to Wizard of Oz at one point in the movie, but by the end of nearly two hours, we reach an anticlimax.    On the collector's edition portion of the disc: Aside from commentary, the collector's edition includes the original 6-minute short of Sky Captain, bloopers, and deleted scenes, including one that should have been left in the movie. Let's just say the scene fills in a part of the story-line transition. Oh well...    For Angelina Jolie fans: she did not disappoint--she just didn't have much of a role, either, contrary to what the DVD cover might indicate.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I love this movie so much that I had to gloat about it, in March. My family and I watch this movie along with the other classic Christmas movies, every Christmas season. I see something new in it every year. I love this movie so much, i get weepy eyed just thinking of it now. This review probably won't help you, sorry; it's all about my expressing my love for this movie.
B001J2WNE4|4.0|I actually listened to most of this cd yesterday on my way back from class. I thought it was very good, creative, and had great beats. John Legend's also got a great voice, which really shines through some of his mediocre r and b songs. I love it how everybody says he's doign the retro thing. But everybody's doing the retro thing and to me it's just r and b. I think he's one of the best new male r and b artists out there today. I actually really liked his duet with brandy. I loved the melody and I thought Brandy sang really good to be quite honest. If you buy this album you won't be disappointed. It's very good, it has great beats, and some of the songs are intersting and fun to listen it. It also has that feel to it, that it's almost like easygoing jazz in sort of a way.it is different from his previous two albums. I applaud him for trying to do a hip club type song green light. I think it's one of the best upbeat songs currently topping the charts.  If your a fan of r and b and love John Legend's previous albums then this is the album to go with.
B001437DMA|3.0|Joe needs to finally tackle the instrumental-fusion genre, as suggested by more than one disappointed reviewer. He's quite capable of it, as he convincingly proved on \\"Bells of Lal-Parts 1 and 2\\" from \\"Flyin' in a Blue Dream\\". This venture is long overdue, would strengthen his musical repertoire and reputation and give us, his audience, a badly needed breath of fresh air. Think about it, Satch!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|This is the best Blu-Ray concert ever! Yes the sound is awesome and the talent as well. I own a lot of Blu-ray concerts and by far this is the best, great picture and awesome sound and ordered a second one for my best friend, you have to share this with your friends its that incredible!
B0018CVQFM|5.0|I was a bit reluctant to buy this for some reason, but I needn't have worried. The hits are all here, of course, as well as lots of remixes and alternate takes, and a gem of a new song (to God) \\"In Your Name\\". The booklet has comments on all the songs, and lots of good photos by Nash (a noted shutterbug) as well as Joel Bernstein, Henry Diltz, and others. The only improvement would be a lower price. Alternatively, you can download the songs you want on Amazon or itunes. But the booklet is half the fun.
0060832819|1.0|Unworthy of the money or time, this novel is not only a drag to read but also offers its reader a perverted view on love and understanding, acquired through extrasensorial means. The plot is inconceivable.  A writer comes to understand himself and his obsession over wife who left him, while enjoying a relationship with someone else? and then protagonist travels to Kazakhstan in a company of Muslim epileptic who preaches Christian love of &quot;Our Lady&quot; just to find his journalist ex-wife at the loom, weaving a carpet. Then the story becomes stranger, because its apparent that researching kazakhs was too much for Paulo. Nomad- living Kazakhs would never accept in its community a married woman (especially caucasian), living without a husband, and changing more then 1 male partner in a course of a year. Kazakh women in tribal communes like the one described in the book would value their virtues, believe that Evil spirits dive into wide eyes and drive wide-eyed people to madness, they would've chased Ester away from the village with stakes and stones. Another fact -Kazah's ancestral heritage and history of mongol horsemen made male species mostly short with bowed legs, and lastly - In some villages its customary for men to cover hair with animal fat. Thus reading last pages made me howl with laughter. To sum it up - if you want a beautiful nomad story of true love that sets out to conquer the earth don't look to Zahir, consider story of Tem&uuml;jin and Borte told in Mongol
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This is obviously not the first in the action/drama genre, therefore, granting a little latitude relative to the cliche, implausible firearm fight shouldn't be a significant stretch.  That said, this unequivocal gem has acquired a life of its own, as proven with its longevity of top 10 grossing box office movies thus far in 2009.  It should be noted that this was achieved with minimal advertising,  attributable primarily to word-of-mouth.     \\"Taken\\" contains elements somewhat reminiscent of the Bourne trilogy, replete with numerous twists and all-too-brief subplots (extrapolated on Blu-ray disc).    Liam Neeson stars with a relatively unknown, albeit sensational cast in this non-stop ride from L.A. to Paris and back contemporary eye-opener, with relatable and extemporaneous intrigue, thought-provoking drama and superbly-placed sarcasism minus the sappy silliness.  Here's hoping to a \\"Taken\\" trilogy!
B0013ND30M|5.0|this movie has been one of my favorites since i was a little girl :)
0765342294|4.0|I had heard of this book and just listened to part of Orson Scott Card's \\"Shadow of the Giant\\" on the Sirius Book Channel, so figured it was time.     It was a great story and definitely makes me want to read more of Scott's work. I agree with the one negative criticism I read here that the writing was somewhat dumbed down, apparently to appeal to the younger crowd (as opposed to \\"Shadow of the Giant\\" which seemed more geared towards adults), but if you can get past that it's a lot of fun. The ending threw me for a loop: I never saw it coming, but maybe I'm just clueless.      Time to grab a few more of Card's books and see what else he has on his mind.

B001QB9H10|4.0|Let's face it, I am a fan of Jason Statham. So that helps me to like a movie significantly. But I don't love all his movies. I did love this one.  I admit was I was disappointed at Transporter 2.  Pretty disappointed.  I was prepared to be disappointed again. But I was not.  This movie was lush and atmospheric.  The music really added to the beauty of it.  It has the European feel that I love about movies like the James Bond films, The Professional, La Femme Nikita, and Hitman.  I wasn't sure about the female co-star who played Valentina at first.  That's because I loved Jason paired with Shu Qi in the first movie so much.  I was still frowning when she started getting that look in her eye when Frank was kicking butt bare-chested.  The same look I get when I watch those scenes.  I was thinking stay away from Lai's (Shu Qi's character's name) man.  I was telling myself he was going to get back together with her. But during the strip-tease scene, which was very nice, I started to warm to her.  I do think that there was good chemistry between them.  It mellowed me despite my intentions to dislike the romantic relationship in this movie.  So I liked the romance, I loved the action, I thought the movie was beautifully shot.  The plot is a bit thin, but I'm more than willing to forgive it because of the joy of watching Jason Statham do his thing and the Luc Besson feel to this movie. Plus we get to see The Transporter get a happy ending. On a superficial and completely boy crazy note, I must say the lovely Jason Statham is looking better than I've ever seen him looking in this movie, and he usually looks mighty fine to me.  Oh, my yummy.  Who said action movies can't be for girls?  I will be going to get my copy of this lovely movie.
B00004WG2F|5.0|This is not your traditional western movie. Based on turn of the century where past and present collide a good must have
B0018RWD6S|4.0|the johnny hartman john coltrane band collabration from the first note creates an atmosphere of a smokey bar with ice clinking in glasses as patrons talk in hushed tones as hartman waxes smooth as glass on vocals and the band is restrained but wonderful......not trying to overshadow hartman but letting you know that they are special to..and special they are as a who's who with elvin jones on drums johhy griffith on bass and mccoy tyner on piano...

B0001CCY7E|5.0|A few years ago,I studied this (cassette tape)many times and actually performed a 20 minute medley from it for an old folks home using a 4 track cassette and a $70 Casio.Since then I have become a pretty good composer of similar soundtrack music and owe it all to John Barry.  I purchased many other soundtrack (CD's)now, and still, hardly anything is more (continually) listenable than \\"Dances with Wolves\\" over and over again.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I hate musicals but I loved this,  If you're a Joss Whedon fan you'll like it and Neil Patrick Harris plays the funniest bad guy you've got to like.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I've never had a problem with the production of Pearl Jam's classic debut album. It's always been a little slicker than the albums that followed, but I feel like it gave the cd its own unique texture within their catalog. But, for years, the members of Pearl Jam indicated they'd like to revisit the album, and now they have. The original cd (included here) sounds great. The \\"redux cd\\" sounds great. Brendan O'Brien's production is immediate and well-balanced. He's a great producer, and he's got a great feel for Pearl Jam, having worked with them numerous times. So, while I don't know that I'd describe it as \\"better\\" or \\"worse,\\" it's another take on how the album should sound. So now there are two versions of one of the best albums of the 90s (or any decade). Cool.<br /><br />Better still is the addition of extra tracks from that era and the fantastic MTV Unplugged performance on dvd.<br /><br />The important thing to note is that this is a well-put-together and well-considered reissue, not just some cash-in. As a long-time fan, I'm really happy to have a new way to revisit this masterpiece.
B00005BL2A|1.0|I've been an avid fan of DM since circa 1984. I have all their CDs, most of their singles, DVDs, seen them every time they've toured since Violator, blah, blah, blah. I was initially disappointed with this release and listening to parts of it again, still am. Here's why: I fell in love with the synthy, dancey, never-done-before-musically-with-electronics DM of the 80s and 90s. Exciter, however, is too downtempo and I guess just not \\"cutting edge\\" enough for me. I suppose some fans who have matured along with the band might like the more \\"contemporary\\" feel of this album (i.e., more subdued, albeit with a better vocal performance), but I - who despite being 25 years older - still like upbeat, synthy, dancey, clubby music (e.g., Erasure then and now, or any of a myriad of synthpop artists who have been emerged in the last decade or so. Sidenote: PSB also suffered the same \\"maturation\\" of their sound on \\"Release\\" and I have the same criticism of that work as I do of Exciter, though to a lesser extent. Thankfully, both bands returned to form with subsequent albums). Exciter was the farthest thing from exciting that DM has ever done. I'm anxiously awaiting SOTU next month; I hope they have continued down the path taken on PTA and not reverted back to the boring Exciter-esque sound.
B001MYIXAC|2.0|I was very disappointed with this DVD.  So much so that I'm returning my copy of it.  I saw the movie in theatres, and found it masterful.  The amazing tone is part of the beauty of the film, and the subtitles on the US DVD release are a travesty.  They remove most of the subtlety from the tone and characters (see [...] for examples). The movie I saw in theatres was a masterpiece; the movie on this DVD (using subtitles) is a mediocrity.  If you are going to buy this DVD, either download and use the theatrical subtitles or use the mediocre dubbing track.  As for me, I'm going to look for another region's copy or wait for a re-release.      In the end, this DVD is a masterclass on why good subtitle translations are critical in foreign films.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|Let the Right One In is a wonderful film. I'm sorry to say, but don't buy from Amazon. If you want the original theatrical subtitles I suggest hunting at local stores. They are out! Check IMDB.com and look under the message board. Someone found the subtitles!!! They are out! Start looking unless Amazon decides to post a disclaimer which versions they have.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|On recommendation of my daughter I purchased this film. It is something akin to Pride and Prejudice.  It jumps right into the soup of life with the characters and situations surrounding them. The acting is superb, setting you up to dislike the \\"villan\\" in the beginning...and then warming to them. The heartwrenching nature of living life like a slave in textile mills was brought home by getting to \\"know\\" them.  It was long enough to become fully engaged in story and characters lives. By the end I knew I need to watch the ending a second time. It is a new family favorite.
B001IMJWW6|4.0|This movie is available in the Public Domain so there are about 1000 versions available.  A lot of the reviews available, only talk about the movie and not the quality of the DVD.  A lot of them say Special Edition or Ultimate Edition or Remastered etc...    So here are what I consider to be the top 3 available through Amazon.  [[ASIN:B000VUQ4HW Nosferatu (The Ultimate Two-Disc Edition)]] is by far the best out there.  Kino does an awsome job of Restoring classics.   The only problem is the price so if you are buying this for school or research, you don't need the quality or the extras.  [[ASIN:B00005YJMX Nosferatu: The Vampyre/Phantom Der Nacht]] is a second by BEWARE, this particular version is a 1979 REMAKE and not the original starring Max Schreck.  Again, if you are buying for research, this is not the version for you.    This version is third.  The Amazon price is reasonable but the reseller price is even better and you get the same product.  The version is better than what is found in the Public Domain and its on DVD so you don't have to watch it on your computer.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I ended up having to purchase this product through an actual store and the video is fine.  My complaint is that I originally attempted to purchase this product through Amazon (not a separate seller but actually from Amazon) and never received it.  I was able to get a refund after waiting for just under one month after the date my package was actually supposed to arrive.  So... while I fully recommend this exercise dvd I would also recommend that you buy it from a seller other than Amazon!
1595141715|1.0|This was a horrible read. The premise is interesting enough, a girl leaves tapes calling out 13 individuals as having a hand in her suicide. However, upon finishing this, it left a sour taste in my mouth.<br /><br />As some other reviews have stated, the book and narration absolves Hannah of all responsibility in her actions, when the decision to commit suicide was entirely her own. I find this reprehensible. As a heroine, Hannah is not sympathetic at all. As I read, I became more and more disgusted with her decision to end her life. What is even more terrible is that these people who she called out as reasons to die will live their lives with guilt that they do not truly deserve. In fact, the most terrible is the last person, who really did not deserve the wrath and hate Hannah bestows on him right before she kills herself.<br /><br />The fact is, many people experience pain throughout their teenage years. Mine were horrible too. But this book makes suicide out to be a noble thing, a poor, damaged teen giving up and dying in the least painful way possible. Suicide is nothing but selfishness. It is thinking that your pain and troubles are the only thing in the world that mean anything. There may have been 13 reasons for Hannah to die, but there were more for her to live. It would have been refreshing to see some of these reasons explored so our impressionable teenagers don't think suicide is the dramatic, noble thing it is portrayed as in this novel.
B001MW0J2Y|4.0|This is an album that just makes you want to turn all the lights off, take the phone off the hook, roll something up and lay on your couch while it plays. Other than a few tracks where his voice kind of sounds like he's trying too hard, I would recommened this to anyone.<br /><br />p.s. Flea is on several of the songs and that just adds to the value.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|This is a classic British comedy from the time when Alec Guiness, Michael Caine, Peter Sellers and other British comic actors (as differentiated from comedians) ruled the roost.<br /><br />  The story is simple. Michael Caine is released from jail. A colleague of is murdered in Italy and his not-terribly-grieving widow brings Caine a message - on film, no less. The sight of Michael Caine sitting next to a film projector watching the outline of the planned heist is hilarious in this day of digital cameras and video iPods.<br /><br />  The story involves Caine getting the permission and assistance of Mr. Bridger, a crime boss who leads a life of luxury behind the walls, recruiting a gang and making arrangements to steal a $ 4-million dollar gold shipment in Turin, Italy. (Four million sounds so small these days, doesn't it?)<br /><br />  The story, frankly, is very thin. This is comedy, not drama. The real pleasure comes in the execution of the heist. A rogue \\"computer expert\\" (a hilarious Benny Hill doing his usual schtick) substitutes a tape - yes, a tape - at the traffic control center, which in turn sets off a massive traffic jam.<br /><br />  The armored convoy carrying the gold is trapped in the midst of this jam and the rest of the film is occupied with the getaway. The getaway features a classic, very funny and very long car chase. Again, this is a comedy, not drama and almost cartoon-like . . . and great fun.<br /><br />  The ending comes as a bit of a surprise and leaves the audience hanging, so to speak.<br /><br />  All in all, a fun film. Funny almost as much for how dated it seems as it is for the humor of it. A fun way to idle away 90 or so minutes while looking back at life in a much simpler time when moviemakers didn't take themselves so seriously.<br /><br />Jerry
0785125965|4.0|I wanted to give 3 1/2 stars, but that wasn't an option. I digress, this book has some very nice art and is action packed to the gillets. That being said there's a lack of a deep story that usually goes with the whole Bruce Banner/Hulk split personalities. The end is extremely cool with the Hulk and the Sentry clashing in a blaze of glory. I would recommend this, esspecially if it's for a kid because it'll hold their attention.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|James Marsh has created a documentary that pays homage to the early masters of the form and one that will stand on its own for generations to come.<br /><br />  It is the story of Phillipe Petit, a self-talk tightrope or wire walker, street performer, publicity hound and obsessive who captured the world's attention in 1976 when he, with the help of interesting band of confederates, walked a wire strung between the newly erected World Trade Center towers.<br /><br />  More than a thousand feet in the air, Petit walked the 200 feet or so between the towers on a quarter-inch thick wire eight times. On occasion he kneeled in salute. He lay down on the wire. He did this all with supreme ease, while onlookers gasped in surprise, shock, awe and fear.<br /><br />  James Marsh pulls together Petit himself, looking vastly older now than the cherubic youth who pulled off this stunt, his girlfriend of the time whom the years have not treated well and several other friends, acquaintances and confederates.<br /><br />  It is a marvelous story. Petit leaves no doubt that he is an obsessive - and watching his skills mature leaves one in awe of his incredibly singular talent. His girlfriend of so long ago lived in thrall to him, doing his ever bidding. She's quite the contrast - the young woman dressed in the style of the 60s and 70s compared to the much older woman of today, showing the ravages of age.<br /><br />  Petit's friends of long standing all attest to the combustibility of Petit and their own tempers.<br /><br />  The stories of the past are intertwined with the meticulous planning for the WTC escapade, which Marsh successfully imbues with the tension of a great bank heist film. The stories of creeping up to the top floor and then scurrying when a guard unexpectedly appears and leans on the tarp they are hiding under are wonderful.<br /><br />  Finally the great event. Footage from the day just leaves the viewer gasping. Mere mortals don't do things like this - walk on a thin wire more than a thousand feet above our heads, kneeling on the wire, laying on the wire.<br /><br />  A police officer, long forgotten to history, lives on in a news interview of the time, his hairstyle so 70s, so retro today, as he talks of the police reaction.<br /><br />  No one treated it as a great crime, though the police officers, angry about being taunted by Petit, did rough him up.<br /><br />  A judge \\"sentenced\\" Petit to a public performance for children. The WTC gave Petit a lifetime pass to the observation deck of the WTC.<br /><br />  Petit faded into semi-obscurity, teaching and performing in New York.<br /><br />  This film, however, assures that future generations will know and see the \\"man on wire\\", as the police complaint describes the event. Petit did something that no other human has done - and that no other human can ever do.<br /><br />  A marvelous film. A tribute to Petite, the \\"man on wire\\" and Marsh, a superb documentarian.<br /><br />Jerryneeling on the wire, laying on the wire.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|More than 10 years after I last saw it,and it still made me feel like a kind again. The picture in this BD makes Pinocchio look its best ever. Disney seems to have done a wonderful job remastering it frame by frame. My only quibble is the fact that the bd version only includes english sountracks, while the free dvd version included in this set brings along french and spanish(my first language). Even though Disney View is good for plasma TV owners, it is also a bit distracting so I rather watch it with black bars since the movie was originally shot in 4:3.
B001B1R1EU|5.0|This is an excellent disc of four of the standard works in the trumpet repertoire. Alison Balsom shows us why she has made such a stir in the musical world with her freshness, verve, tenderness and a beautiful tone. The lovely, sharp clarity of the sparkling vigorous passages is a joy but what I really loved most was the tender, beautifully phrased slow movements of both the Haydn and the Hummel concertos. It is here that Balsom shows her real control and unflashy virtuosity, and they are truly excellent. The orchestral playing is top-notch, too and the disc is worth buying even if you already own other recordings of these works.<br /><br />I do have an objection to the packaging. Jonathan Freeman-Attwood's notes are very good, but I could have done without quite so many photos of Ms Balsom looking sultry in an off-the-shoulder dress. A portrait of the artist is quite appropriate on a CD, and obviously they will want it to be a flattering one, but this makes her look like just another in the line of moderately-talented musicians of both sexes being marketed on sex-appeal. She isn't. Alison Balsom is a musician of the first rank and I think that she - and we - deserve something a little more dignified.<br /><br />However, dismounting from my hobby-horse, the disc itself is a huge pleasure and a minor packaging gripe shouldn't put you off. It's terrific, and I recommend it in the warmest terms.
B0013FBS20|1.0|As are most movies that have a cast of ONE (unless you include the dog), this movie is DULL.  Think Castaway, where the guy talks to a volleyball. Now simply substitute a dog instead of a volleyball and there you have it.
0790733226|3.0|I think they definately should have stuck more closely to the source material. Ellie developing a sexual relationship with Palmer was really corny. I saw this movie once years ago, years before reading the book and I liked it alot then. But I just read the book a couple weeks ago, so I went back and bought this movie and realized how much they actually changed... for the worse.<br /><br />The main thing that troubles me with this film is the theological aspects. I'm an atheist (I wasn't when I first watched the movie years ago, so I didn't catch all the religious overtones at first) and I felt kind of slighted at the treatment of the source material. The way they made Ellie seem like a bad person for being an atheist. Granted, in the real world that is likely how it would've played out, but I can't help but feel this movie had more of a pro-religion agenda.<br /><br />The worst part of the film was definately the ending... If they had followed the book directly, the ending would've been much more dynamic. They also definately should've kept S.R. Hadden's ending. It was so cool, but instead in the book we just see S.R. Hadden's dead body being wrapped up. The book's ending was definately ten times more satisfying than the movie version's. All in all, I'd recommend this to others, but warning to those who have read the novel and loved it, you will be disappointed in this film, at least slightly.

1400049628|4.0|The guide can be an interesting book at times and a boring book at times.  Overall it's worth getting though.  There are inconsistencies.  The timeline for a zombie infection is 16 hours from bite to coma, 4 more hours before death, and 3 more hours before reanimation.  Later in the stories we see a guy walking into town at night with a bite mark and infection, then there being 21 zombies by dawn.  We also read a report of someone being bitten and killed, then reanimating in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.

My favorite track here was \\"Money\\" (track 6, of 10) -- and I thought, why not get it in gold! -- if you can.  Well, I did.  And now, I like 'em all!

B0000024W3|4.0|I kind of love \\"Self Portrait,\\" even though I know the intent behind it was to declare independence from his \\"leeching\\" fans.  I got interested in hearing it again after reading his autobiography, \\"Chronicles Part 1,\\" in which he demonstrates the degree to which he came into the music scene as a kind of musicologist -- a kind of private collector of American songs without regard for genre. On only a few albums does he allow his love for American music to take precedence over his own songwriting, and this is one of those few.  (The others are his first album, and the 1990s collections \\"Good As I Been To You\\" and \\"World Gone Wrong.\\" Cover versions also appear on some of the Bootleg Series disks, especially #1-3, and #8, and on \\"Biograph.\\") He is a thoughtful, reverent interpreter of the songs he loves, songs he seems to understand from the inside out.  That's what threw people off in 1970.  If you were going to record an old country chestnut like \\"I've Forgotten More...\\" you undoubtedly had to have your tongue in cheek, but Dylan croons it with evident sincerity, and pulls off a version that stands with any other. Same with \\"Let it Be Me,\\" \\"Blue Moon,\\" and \\"Take a Message to Mary.\\"<br /><br />Some of the other covers of more folkish material are flat-out fantastic, and don't deserve to be dismissed in any way. \\"Copper Kettle,\\" \\"Days of '49\\" and \\"Alberta\\" are great recordings, and hold up very well against all the other music he was recording in the period between the classics \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" and \\"Blood on the Tracks.\\"  You could easily assemble a single album out of this collection that would be his second-best album of that period after \\"John Wesley Harding.\\"  It would include:<br /><br />\\"All the Tired Horses\\"<br />\\"Alberta No. 1\\"<br />\\"I Forgot More...\\"<br />\\"Days of '49\\"<br />\\"Early Morning Rain\\"<br />\\"Let it Be Me\\"<br />\\"Belle Isle\\"<br />\\"Living the Blues\\"<br />\\"Copper Kettle\\"<br />\\"Gotta Travel On\\"<br />\\"Blue Moon\\"<br />\\"Take Me as I Am (Or Let Me Go)\\"<br />\\"Take a Message to Mary\\"<br />\\"It Hurts Me Too\\"<br />\\"Wigwam\\"<br /><br />That's 16 songs. The other stuff -- sloppy things like the live stuff with The Band, the dumb version of \\"The Boxer,\\" the pointless \\"Woogie Boogie\\" are what drag this album down in the esteem of Dylanologists and overthinkers like Greil Marcus.<br /><br />But what I suspect really killed its reception from the cradle was Dylan calling it \\"Self Portrait.\\"  All the fans of that era -- they thought they knew who he was.  He was an icon for radicals and pseudo-revolutionaries. Or, he was the epitome of the rock/folk singer-songwriter, the trailblazer for artists like Paul Simon, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. Or, he was a poet of the streets, the surreal prophet of chaos. No, Dylan says, here: I'm none of those. I'm just a guy who likes old songs. These songs inspire me. Not just Woody Guthrie, but also those old redneck crooners, too, and those phonies on Broadway. I could play Grand Old Opry without a lick of shame.  The Dylan fanatics of 1970 could not accept that.<br /><br />If he'd posed on the front cover with a guitar in front of a studio in Nashville and called it \\"The Nashville Project,\\" and trimmed it a little, it might've won a good review in Rolling Stone.  But I think it's fair to say that by 1970, Bob Dylan was no longer in search of Rolling Stone's approval.16 songs.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I've heard good things about the Planet Earth series. Never had an opportunity to see much it when it was playing on TV. Well, just got a new HD TV and have been looking for good 1080P material. This 4 disk set has not disappointed me at all. My four year old son loves it to. The animals and locations are just breath taking in 1080. Feels like you're there. My wife also enjoys it to. We just finished disk two, and can't wait to see what's on the next two disks. Amazon had the best price and I opted for the free shipping. Why not save a few bucks.
0143038419|3.0|This memoir begins with an unhappy person not knowing why she is so unhappy.  She has the husband, the home, tha All American Life.  She finds herself on her bathroom floor confused as to why she is crying alone, feeling so alone and discontented.  She does write in a humorous manner.  The begginging of the book caught me but by two thirds the way through I was done reading this book.  The memoir seems to turn into a personal Self-Help book.  I can identify with the unhappiness of her life in the beginning of the book...however it seems she is trying to send a message as to find happiness and inner peace by spending a year traveling.  First to Rome where she gets an apartment, then to India where she finds the power of prayer.  As I got to the part where she gets to Indonesia I was bored and felt her attempt to write this as a self-help/memoir was unrealistic.  Her message seems to tell the average person to spend a year traveling which we all know is pretty impossible for the average person to take a year off and spend an expensive year traveling the globe.  I believe if we had the chance to experience what she has in this book we might find what she has.  I just don't like that it started as a memoir and then turned out feeling like a self-help book
B0002NRQTS|4.0|Like with Grace Under Pressure, I have to own up to bias here. Having not been a fan of the band, I was intrigued by the then-new Show Don't Tell popping up on the radio. It was catchy and melodic and tapped into something in me that inspired me to (eventually) pick up the album on a complete lark. I'm assuming it was my nearly unconscious niggle to get into this band fully, which I seemed to resist (rim shot) with grace (d'oh!). Digging deeper I discovered a warmer sound than I remembered from this band previously. That's not a comment about the production either, which, frankly, never bothered me....although it's true the mix is almost as quiet as Vapor Trails is noisy.     The very first things I noticed on initial spins of this album were the presence of more acoustic guitars than I was accustomed to and next, the lack (or at least reduction) of keyboards from the things I'd heard on radio in the recent past from Hold Your Fire and Power Windows. Not that the keys ever bothered me, but it seemed that the reliance on keys and shimmering guitar accents from Alex had been bathed in more simplified and lush guitar-based rhythms and it was a nice change. Certainly The Pass stood out for me right away, first melodically as I'm prone to have happen...and then, finally, lyrically the song was really compelling. This song was a pleasant surprise for me and one that reminded me of another facet of Presto which made it something a bit different from many of the immediate predecessors; Geddy's voice. His shriek had never bothered me, but I'd be lying if I said what I heard on The Pass didn't immediately fill me with a deeper appreciation for his vocal abilities. It's ironic to hear many fans (now) say that it was around then that they began to lose faith in the band and it was this very change that had intrigued me. It makes sense, given I wasn't there smoking pot in my basement to hours of 2112 on end and if I hadn't been such a dis(joint)ed \\"fan,\\" I might've felt that waytoo. But I was really liking what I was hearing.    Much of the rest of the album, at that time, was hit and miss. Scars stood out right away and I've become even more infatuated with this little gem since. Even hearing the music track alone as the soundtrack over the boys journeying throughout South America on the Rush In Rio documentary gets me excited. Presto and Available Light were two more that were really lovely and once again became songs that I admired that much more over time. Really two top notch tunes. Some of the misses at the time included tracks like War Paint and Red Tide, which, like many blase Rush songs were akin to drinking a full glass of luke-warm water on a hot day...generally unsatisfying. However time has been good to those two tracks as well and I've come to appreciate both. The \\"boys and girls together\\" melody (I'm convinced Neil should never say \\"boy\\" or \\"girl\\" in songs ever again) used to bother me, but I like the message of the lyrics so well that I'm not too irked anymore. The lyrics to Red Tide are prime too and the melody really works for me. But early on these songs did not stand out like the title track or The Pass.    A few that didn't work for me then or now include Superconductor, which I come to find has a bit of a following in the fan circles but which has always read to me as unpleasing, even musically. The chorus and especially the \\"super-con-duc-tor\\" part never fails to remind me of something Robert Palmer might've crooned and I equally roll my eyes and giggle when I hear it. Hand Over Fist is another one that never sat well with me either, although I have to say I like it more than the former. Once again it's the lyric that bothers me, perhaps because it references a child's game and to me that's not terribly rock and roll...to be singing about paper covering rock and scissors cutting....etc. There are times when Neil seems about one full generation older than he actually is and occasionally I suffer disconnect as a result. (His \\"clever\\" lyrics to Dog Years are the epitome of this \\"get it??\\" type elbowing of the ribs). Melodically the song is pretty solid, however.    Poor Anagram (For Mongo). I really want to like this song but every single time I listen to it, I have to look at the track listing and ask myself, \\"What song is this one again??\\" STILL. I can't hum one melody or lyric right now, not if my life was at stake and Dirty Harry had his magnum to my skull...although if I started to play it, it would flood back to me instantly. So I'll simply relegate Anagram to that category of perfectly innocuous yet highly unmemorable. I'm not sure I've much choice.    Overall then and especially now, however, I'm very pleased with Presto. I've read criticisms that the album seems hodge-podge and disjointed (Chemistry by Jon Collins), but I don't believe that at all. While the songs have a stylistic diversity (Scars v. The Pass), there's a definite cohesiveness in this body of work that I can appreciate...and certainly a positive response from me for that warm (brown) tone that bathes the songs with a bit less shimmering brightness and a bit more of an earthy and folksy foundation. I liked it then as a hesitant fan and I like it that much more today. Sure there are a few clunkers, but even the worst of Presto isn't awful, just a bit vanilla. And outside the bottom three or so songs, the rest runs the gamut from inspiring to downright incredible.    PRESTO: 4 stars of 5 (+)

It passed the test of a series finale: \\"Was I satisfied as a reader?\\"  It also passed my test of good escapist fiction: \\"Would I want to read this again some day.\\"  I was curious as to the negative review by Publishers Weekly, and after reading its reviews of the final book of Harry Potter (also passed both tests) and the final book of Pullman's Dark Materials trilogy (failed both tests), I guess Publishers Weekly comes from a different dimension than I.  So now I know Publishers Weekly is like my local newspaper's endorsements -- if I am uncertain, see what they recommend and go the opposite way.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|When I was a freshman in high school, I remember a friend of mine cranking the volume on \\"Even Flow\\" and not knowing what hit me.  A quick trip my beloved Brass City Records in Waterbury, CT later, and I would begin spinning [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]] over and over again.  18 years later, my perception on the record has evened out a little bit-- it's not quite the masterpiece I would have credited it with being at 14, but it is an awfully good record, and receiving a great presentation in this package.    Housed in a slipcase, the album is presented in two mixes-- the original as released in 1991 and a remix by the band's longtime producer Brenden O'Brien.  To the remixed version, the band's appended half a dozen unreleased tracks.  In addition to a booklet containing photos of the band, this reissue includes a DVD of the band's performance on \\"MTV Unplugged\\".    So [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]], Seattle grunge stirred up with a healthy dose of arena rock bombast, is a singular achievement, straddling remarkably comfortably the fence of commercial appeal and artistic merit.  Effectively standout cut after standout cut, [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]] moves from hard driving grunge rockers (\\"Porch\\") to rock anthems (\\"Alive\\") to songs of wilted love (\\"Black\\") and pained self-reflection (\\"Release\\").  Along the way, it never feels forced, it never feels overdone, and it certainly never feels insincere.  And if that wasn't enough, the band just turns in great performances over and over again.    For this reissue, the two mixes present an interesting contrast.  The original mix has a charm to itself, but it tends to emphasize the band's arena rock sounds and can make them feel a bit overblown.  And on occasion, odd choices of effects can get in the way of the pieces (the treatment of the vocal on \\"Oceans\\").  I found myself really happy with the mix by Brendan O'Brien, who seems to have brought a bit more bite to the music, taken away some of the brightness and leaving the impression thatthe band is in the room and Vedder is singing right in your ear-- opener \\"Once\\" hits like an explosion, \\"Oceans\\" is a revelation, \\"Porch\\" is startling and \\"Release\\", a piece that over the years has come more and more to have immense weight in my life, takes on even more depth and color.    The bonus tracks are kind of a mixed bag-- they're nice to have, by and large, but none of them are fantastic.  The oddly downtempo performance of \\"State of Love and Trust\\" is interesting to hear, if nothing else for just how much the right tempo can take a weak song and make it fantastic and \\"2000 Mile Blues\\", an on-the-spot blues improv, is a whole lot of fun, but none of it is something I could say I needed to have.    The MTV Unplugged disc is a different story altogether-- I remember seeing this when it first aired and being floored by it, staring in awe at the screen while Vedder laid his heart in front of us on \\"Black\\" and feeling the manic energy of \\"State of Love and Trust\\" role through me as I kept trying to find ways to get my little 13\\" tube to play a little louder.  That the performance was as great as I remember from when I was 14 is a nice surprise, things often seem better in the past.  I was a little disappointed that it's a 4x3 video presentation (\\"full screen\\" as opposed to \\"wide screen\\"), but I'm guessing that's the source material.  Having said that, the picture quality was sharp and it sounded great.    The bottom line for me, [[ASIN:B001N18HOQ Ten (Deluxe Edition) (2CD/1 DVD)]] is a fine reissue, I'm really happy to have gotten it.  They've also released [[ASIN:B001N18HOG Ten (Legacy Edition) (2CDs)]] without the DVD for a few bucks less, but really the Unplugged show is well worth the investment and I'd suggest this edition over the other.  Highly recommended.

1400064287|5.0|So, I'm just going to come out and say it.  I loved this book.  The vibrant orange cover with its duct tape image automatically intrigued me and I could not have been more anxious to begin \\"Made to Stick\\".  This book is a book about ideas.  And although that concept may seem like nothing new, Chip & Dan's approach sets itself above the rest by not just applying to one group of readers like CEOs, but to teachers, students, you name it.  So, as I'm reading I immediately thought of many friends and family that would enjoy and benefit from reading this as well because it transfers across the board no matter who you are or what you do.    What makes this a fascinating and effective read is the amount of examples from some of the most creative and profound ideas to even some of the duds that flopped.  Examples are a wonderful tool to get to see what has worked and what hasn't and this book was not short on them.   As the reader is examining these ideas we're also getting the privilege of exploring the authors 6 principles for the making of a \\"sticky idea\\" which are    Simplicity  Unexpectedness  Concreteness  Credibility  Emotional  Stories    It's a wonderful guideline to go by to effectively get your message across and make an impression with your audience whether you're trying to present a new advertising strategy at work or teaching a group of fourth graders math.      I felt \\"Made to Stick\\" was a wonderfully fun and helpful book.  It was not only full of some great information that I can take with me day in and day out, but the book is so brilliantly set up to allow me to easily revert back to the information and give myself a refresher.  This book is a must read for any occupation, any adult and any bookshelf.  [...]
B000N3AWDE|4.0|I have to say that I still prefer her other French albums than D'Elles which is above average and still pleasant to listen too in the car as I do but I'm not that crazy for it and decided to listen to the French Album instead. There is no question that Celine has a wonderful voice and she can beautifully in both French and English. I still enjoy the compact disc though.
B001EO748M|5.0|The first season of the Tudors showed the growing relationship between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />In the second season we see the rest of the relationship.<br /><br />The second season starts off during their engagement when Henry forces Catherine of Aragon away from Court and goes from their marriage to Henry's courtship of third wife Jane Seymour to the imprisonment and beheading of Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />All in all the second season was very good with great acting from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Natalie Dormer and the rest of the cast.
0486440966|4.0|\\"The Woman in White\\" is a good, intricate mystery and Collin's character studies are quite interesting. The title character in particular is well thought out, even though she surfaces only intermittently throughout the book. I would give Collin's mystery plot 5 stars, but the book as a whole only garners 4 stars from me.<br /><br />In \\"The Woman in White,\\" Collins meanders quite a bit, both during lengthy descriptions and within characters' endless dialog. I was amused to find that even Collins is aware of his own meandering, because on more than one occasion his own characters mention their difficulty in getting to the point. It is evident that Collin's tour de force character is Count Fosco, and as interesting as the count may be, I felt that Collins became overly-indulgent in building this character up into the almost perfect criminal. This seemed problematic for Collins toward the end when he was forced to venture into the deep waters of international intrigue in order to tie up the plot loose ends regarding Fosco.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book to those who love a good mystery. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read.
B000TEPDOU|4.0|This is truely one of the, if not the best, modern Tull albums. It's got tons of Flute on it! And, lots of nice orchestral arrangements leaving behind any remnents of the 80's sounding synths and electronic drums. There is a slight middle eastern flair to many of the songs, which works perfect with Ian's flute playing. Very enjoyable to listen too. The lyrics have a real original feel to them, with no reliance on repeating similar stylings or sections from their past works. This one deserves the high ratings it has received, 4 1/2 stars actually. It's just not quite a masterpeice, but close.

B0002S947K|3.0|I was not completely unsatisfied with this CD.  The opener \\"Trouble\\" is strong.  Other tracks that stand out to me are \\"Jolene,\\" \\"Forever My Friend,\\" and \\"Hannah.\\"  The problem I have with this CD is that after listening to the first few songs they all start to mesh together and sound the same.  The chord changes are very similar for all of the songs and extremely predictable (musicians with good ears will know what I'm talking about).  This isn't necessarilly a mark of a bad songwriter or a bad album.  I just wish it had been a little more varied.  Also, don't expect to shake your booty or be uplifted.  If you need a decent acoustic CD to put on and brood, then this is a pretty safe bet.
142312166X|5.0|My son, age 9, and I have been reading this series. This book is great fun. The questions for the interviews are funny as are the responses. It looked to us like someone had a fun time putting this together. The short stories are true to character of the other longer books.<br /><br />This is a short read that adds to the series and expands on the information about the main characters in the longer books.<br /><br />Well worth the money<br />Enjoy.

1416562605|3.0|In Aravind Adiga's debut novel The White Tiger, Winner of the 2008 Booker Prize, we meet narrator and protagonist Balram Halwai, an intelligent man who was born into poverty. The novel is told in the form of letters from Balram written to the premier of China who is to visit India.<br /><br />When Balram was a young school boy, he was the only one his age who could read and write. He was identified as the \\"White Tiger\\", the rarest creature in the jungle. He was promised a scholarship because of his abilities but he was unable to continue his education, and instead he was forced to take a job as a cleaner to help out his family.<br /><br />Balram eventually rises from poverty and he becomes a driver for a wealthy businessman in Delhi. He also acquires his own fleet of cars and we learn how he was able to rise out of poverty. He tells how in order to change ones caste, one must learn how to listen very closely (eavesdrop), and even be willing to do other deplorable things as well.<br /><br />I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed in this story. I found the main character unlikable, he seemed unable to feel any sort of remorse for the terrible things he did. His wealthy boss and his wife treated people horribly and did not take responsibility for their actions.<br /><br />One thing that did shine through for me in this story was the great divide between the classes in India, but then I did not need to read this particular book to learn about something I already knew. In summary I feel that this is one of those books where opinions will differ greatly. I am not sorry that I read the book, but it was easy for me to move on and forget about it after turning the final page.
B001CDLATE|5.0|There are already plenty of detailed reviews here about the film itself---I've been a huge fan since seeing the theatrical release, and consider it probably my all-time favorite film ever.   However, I'd been holding out on buying a BluRay player.  That is, until I saw that the BluRay version of Baraka was available; that was enough to get me to buy a player and the disc (making it the third copy I've owned, from VHS, to DVD, to BluRay.)  The quality of the BluRay version is simply astonishing.  How much of that has to do with BluRay's technology, and how much is the 8K scan used to transfer from the original film, I'm not sure.  (The documentary of the BluRay transfer & restoration process is fascinating and impressive.  I would agree with the comment expressed there, that this represents the finest transfer of film to digital, ever.)  It is simply a revelation seeing the BluRay version.  Picture and sound are brilliant, details crisp and visible once more, like in the theater.  (Even the menu to navigate through the chapters is a wonderful improvement over the DVD version!)    I will point out here that my first BluRay disc of Baraka seemed to be a bad copy---it locked up in the player at 1:12:10.  I could play everything before that point, and from the next chapter to the end of the film, plus the bonus material... but not right at the 1hr-12min mark.  I saw no obvious damage on the disc, and returned it for an exchange; the second disc worked just fine.    I highly recommend this BluRay version to every fan of Baraka, and of course, the film itself is something I think everyone should see at least twice...!   And if like me, you were seeking a reason to go out and buy a BluRay, your reason is here.
B00006690G|1.0|I used to be an Em fan until this album,what a sell out!  Em can never be a consious rapper,get real...lol  His last 2 albums were good but this one made me lose interest in him.Oh yeah,bringing Curtis \\"50 cent\\" Jackson,made me even dislike him even more!  To me,Ems a comedian rapper but that can only take you so far.  His lyrics were wack and the beat production was horrible!  I guess I'm not a fan of Pop rap,but hey look at the industry now,we got a lot of those.  Feminem is one of the most overrated rappers of all time along with Jay-z,biggie,and lil wayne!Be warned don't buy this garbage album or Encore and save your money.

Cast with Adrien Brody, Jeffery Wright, Beyonce Knowles all give great performances. Supporting actor Eamonn Walker is tremendous as Howlin Wolf and Mos Def a hilarious Chuck Berry. Highly recommended.
B000002H2H|5.0|If you listen to their music in order, this album is a tremendous step forward from their 1st album. Not that Kill Em All was bad because it was very good, but now they have depth and progression in their music. It is not just straight forward thrash. And this is the beginning of the blueprint for MOP, AJFA and now Death Magnetic in terms of where songs are placed. Title track is 2nd, opening track starts with a slow, acoustic style and then rips into a fast pace, 4th track is the ballad type song and then at the end you have your instrumental.    While I do not care much for Escape and Trapped Under Ice, the rest of the tracks are just so stunning that I had to give it 5 stars. Creeping Death is my favorite. Fade to Black is their 1st attempt of a slower type ballad song. The Call of Ktulu is a beautiful instrumental and Whom The Bell Tolls and Fight Fire With Fire are awesome.    Definitely check this album out. It is my 2nd favorite behind Master of Puppets.
0439023483|3.0|I'm a big fan of dystopian fiction.  Unfortunately - as with mysteries and thrillers - there only seem to be a handful of ideas that get endlessly tossed around back and forth.  The Hunger Games plucked just such a tried and true idea as its basis.  That said, its not a bad idea.  But unfortunately I couldn't get images of Stephen King's The Running Man (or scenes from the movie) out of my head while reading it.  Been there, done that.  And it's bleak, not in and of itself a bad thing but combined with the brutality (again, not bad), it's a pretty harsh book that takes an emotional toll.  Which is precisely what Collins was going for.    Bonus points for being a thought-provoking, emotionally-wrenching book.  But deductions for being derivative.
B001CTUI8M|5.0|I layed out the funds to buy this on Blu-ray because I wanted the best sound and video.  I don't regret the purchase because the concert is very good.  The audio and video is also very good.  There are a couple things worth mentioning to those in the U.S.  First off I noticed this import came with two discs, I assumed the second disc to be the CD as the U.S. version comes with movie and CD, NOT the case.  This imports second disc is a DVD of extra features which you think well that isn't so bad but the DVD is a PAL format for Europe and won't play in most DVD players sold in the U.S. because we use NTSC.  Some players like certain LG's play PAL, and I believe maybe an Oppo player.  So the second disc is a bit of a waste for us.  Also, the concert is mostly in English but the bonus material is not.  So what I'm saying for us in the U.S. the money on the Blu-ray is spent pretty much just for the concert footage.  I don't know why the U.S. would offer Black Symphony on DVD and not Blu-ray.  If you can live with the resolution of DVD you might find that combo with the CD a better way to go.  With that being said, if you have Blu-ray the audio and picture is a significant improvement over the DVD.    I found Sharon Den Adel just captivating.  She has a lovely voice and went through a few costume changes during the show.  The concert keeps you wishing you were there.  The orchestra and choir, the band, some special effects, all blend to make Black Symphony a sensational experience.
B000YDOOUK|4.0|This is good stuff. It's ACDC updated. So what, the singer sounds like Brian Johnson. So didn't Tom Keifer of Cinderella, and the singer from Accept. In this new era of rock, this band proves you don't have to shock people. Or scare everybody, or be weird. Rock music runs in cycles. Airbourne puts the smack down on the pretty boys of pop rock! Hopefully this trend continues. I was miserable when Nirvana came along...GAG!

0671646788|5.0|The Magic of Thinking Big played a big part in opening my eyes to how limited my thinking had been. It's scary, as I think back and remember how tight and restricted my beliefs were, regarding what I would \\"realistically\\" be able to do in this world.<br /><br />I was diagnosed with ADHD in 1971, and barely graduated high school in 1984 with a 1.46 GPA. I would suspect there were field mice with more self-esteem than I had in 1984.<br /><br />In 1978, a family friend gave me a copy of Think and Grow Rich. While this book would later prove to be instrumental, at the time, it just didn't match up with what was going on in my life.<br /><br />The Magic of Thinking Big was the book that made things click. Schwartz demolished my previous thoughts on my capabilities. He made it possible for me to dream BIG, and feel like doing so was an intelligent thing to do.<br /><br />22 years after barely making it out of high school, I graduated magna cum laude from Graceland University, and recently published my first book.<br /><br />I re-read this book at least once each year- it made that much of a difference in my life. I would urge you to do the same.
1401201911|5.0|Overall a great read. If your a Superman fan you should definitely pick this up.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|I loved the movie that started it all.  I saw couple of episodes of the tv show.  When I heard about this movie and read the positive reviews, I gave it a shot.    Well, it has this tv show feeling, you know, simple sets, simple special effects, overly simple plot and so on.    Besides, while watching I've realised how similar the technology became with the Star Trek series, the cloaking, beaming and the lightspeed thing.  I can understand the necessity but I felt like the concept of Stargate has, how can I put it, estranged so much from the original movie.    I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I'll watch it ever again.  I guess this title pleases the fans, so if you're not a fan, or never heard of the show, you will not lose anything by skipping this title.
B000059MEK|5.0|There is something to be said about the detail and perfection that went into producing this album. Whether it be the samples or the layering or the hooks and song structure reminisent of previous classic albums from past Generations, Daft Punk needn't make an album this perfect again...unless they want to. I don't doubt they couldn't but why?  There's a reason we haven't had a New Full-fledged album treating from them since Human After All...they obviously are still drawing in their ever growing fans through the distillment and exposure to their past 3 albums and only albums to date. I think they are going to either blow us away or open us to a new retracing like they have with their newfound filmmaking mastery. If you haven't seen ELECTROMA, by all means do, it is essential for all fans and anyone born in the Gen X/Y bracket (for me, Mid 80's)...I totally see why now they are masters of anything they grace.  They have made absolute masterpieces with complex simplicity and far-reaching pop culture statement. Reveiewing their career at this point, I believe they have always been following the truest Artist's path, and through Dance Music to Avant-Garde Film Making, they are excelling and reaching new artistic levels.     All of the songs here in Discovery are classics, of course!    And since we are reviewing let's bring it up to date...  as we've noticed since their debut, the Daft trend of album releasing...    Homework (March 1997)  Discovery (March 2001)  Human After All (March 2005)    A four year in between pattern had assumed the format, but as for this year, 2009, we have yet to see what will happen in Daft Punk history...  For now we know the Concerts are Legend, seen by all over the World,  The Movie, internationally received, panned by many as a startling beginning of(?)...what will be the 2009 Daft Punk Odyssey...    As they would like it...patiently wait and see...    Oh yes, and one of the Members does Live in L.A. and they have indeed signed to a NEW,INDIE label and are working with an unspecified Los Angeles  Management Group. So they have settled, mostly in the Southwestern United States, much like their Movie has hinted at (?)...  California should be grateful and appreciative, that we have the privilage of Daft Punk possibly making the West Coast their new workplace (will they record in the U.S.???)

B0009MAO46|3.0|A cute movie and a hit with our kids but I was unpleasantly surprised with some of the name calling on a G rated movie.  (although this is typical of Disney lately)  Here are some of the names you can look forward to hearing your young children repeat: Dirt bag, freak, idiot, there are a few more that are escaping my memory.  Also besides the scene where Buzz is \\"drunk\\" on tea the movie is cute but not something I would put my kids to bed watching every night.
6305736650|5.0|Casablanca is one of the most essential films you should watch and own in your DVD collection. Casablanca has action, romance, intrigue and much, much more. It's also a story about people suffering in the most desperate of times during World War II when The Nazis were occupying many countries and even had a presence in North Africa where this film takes place. The cinematography and the choreography are excellent. In addition, the acting is superlative and the plot moves along at a very good pace.<br /><br />When the action starts, we see the French Moroccan town of Casablanca where refugees from Nazi Europe come in the hopes of getting a high priced, black market exit visa to Lisbon--and from there, America. An expatriate named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns a nightclub in Casablanca where they serve up the drinks and the local Vichy government official Captain Renault (Claude Rains) turns a blind eye to the illegal gambling there--just so long as Rick lets him win at roulette! At the same time we also learn that two German couriers have been killed--and the two exit visas they had have been stolen by an unknown thief. The Nazis are fast on the hunt for this man, whom they believe to be a big resistance fighter named Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Laszlo has been a tough enemy of the Nazis; he even escaped from a concentration camp!<br /><br />One night Victor and his wife Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) enter Rick's caf&eacute; hoping to buy those two precious exit visas from a character simply named Ugarte (Peter Lorre). Ugarte gets into a fight with some Nazis and he is killed--but not before he slips the exit visas to Rick for some \\"temporary safekeeping.\\" Eventually the Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) confronts Victor and his wife Ilsa in his office with Captain Renault; but Strasser will only let them out of Casablanca if Victor rats on other leaders of the resistance movement.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a whole other story is percolating--and this aspect of the story gets pretty hot, too. It seems that just before the German occupation of France, Rick and Victor's wife Ilsa had a brief love affair. At the time, Ilsa thought that Victor was dead and so she didn't think she was cheating on him. However, Rick gets a huge shock. Just when Rick and his sidekick Sam the piano player (Dooley Wilson) are about to leave Paris for safer ground along with Ilsa, Sam hands Rick a note from Ilsa telling him they can never see each other again and she doesn't even say why. But now that Rick sees Ilsa is married to Victor, Rick finally knows why Ilsa dumped him. But wow, he is upset and angry anyway! He still loves Ilsa; and she loves both him and Victor in her heart of hearts.<br /><br />Although it may seem that I've already written too much, I already left out some juicy details to the plot to keep you interested up to this point. And, of course, this is all very heavy stuff--how will it all turn out? Will Victor be trapped by Major Strasser and the other Nazis and be unable to leave Casablanca? Will Ilsa leave Victor for Rick now that she knows she still loves Rick? What ever does happen to those exit visas that Ugarte gave to Rick--does Rick hold onto them or will he sell them to the highest bidder and get out of Casablanca himself? Watch and find out!<br /><br />The single DVD version of this movie doesn't have too many extras; but you will get a half-hour documentary entitled \\"You Must Remember This\\" which is both hosted and narrated by Lauren Bacall. We do get outtakes but they are included in this documentary.  In addition, I believe that if you buy the two DVD edition of this film, you get a much longer (almost 90 minute) documentary about Humphrey Bogart's career also hosted by Lauren Bacall. The two DVD edition has commentaries by Roger Ebert and Rudy Behlmer.<br /><br />Casablanca is a \\"must-have\\" movie with outstanding attention to detail; the story is practically guaranteed to have quite an effect on you. I highly recommendthis film for fans of the actors in it; and people who enjoy classic movies will cherish this as well.o enjoy classic movies will cherish this as well.
1400082773|3.0|I'll preface this by saying that I love Barack Obama and think he's the best thing that has happened to this country in a long time - there I've said it, you can stop reading now if you have a problem with that.    While I think he's a phenomenal speaker and I appreciate his writing ability and think his use of language is spot on, I have not been able to get through either of his books! I did better with \\"Dreams from My Father\\" than with \\"The Audacity of Hope\\", but I still couldn't finish it.    I started off fine, with the first section \\"Origins\\" where he describes growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia, meeting his father, his college years and living in New York.  How he wrestles with his racial heritage and the conflicts therein is very interesting and his brief flirtation with Black militancy was fascinating.  You can start to see how he grew up into the man he is today.    The second section \\"Chicago\\", however, lost me.  I found his narrative of the community organization stuff tedious.  I got the people confused, all of his well-intentioned efforts were frustrating (at least as far as I got).  So I started skipping around.  I read about his meeting Reverend Wright and can completely understand why he chose to establish a relationship with the Reverend and it helps understand why Jeremiah Wright is the way he is.  I read about when his Kenyan half-sister Auma visited him, and then I stopped reading that section.    The third section \\"Kenya\\" was OK, but by the time I got to it, I was tired of reading this book.  I skipped around enough to learn about the complexity of his family in Kenya - where men have several wives and children with al of them.  I'm not sure how many half-siblings Obama has on his father's side but there seems to be a lot of them!  There is some beautiful, contemplative writing in this section and you can see how this trip affected him deeply.    I may come back and read the whole thing some day, but for now I recommend it with the caveat thatI found a lot of it tedious.
B001ECE6C6|4.0|When a musician wanders from his familiar groove as did Pat Metheny did on an album such as Upojenie, it is bound to provoke a mixed reaction from his fan base such as has occurred here. Since I am only a sometime fan of Metheny's music, I had no real idea what to expect when I bought this on the recommendation of a friend whose musical tastes rather closely parallel mine. So I approached it with open ears and an open mind.  On first listen, my initial reaction was one of ambivalence, meaning I found it merely OK. Anna Maria Jopek's vocals bore a superficial resemblance to those of Astrud Gilberto and Metheny's play seemed rather uninspired. It was only later when I had the chance to listen without distractions that I came to fully appreciate the fruit of this unusual collaboration.  Here are my favorites: I like the soulful and vaguely Brazilian feel of Mania Mienia; Are You Going With Me? with its dreamy synth interlude reminiscent of Al Dimeola's work on Soaring Through A Dream; the sultry samba of Czarne Slowa; the mysterious Me Jedyne Niebo; the soothing instrumental Polskiedrog; and the jaunty Tam, Gdzie Nie Siega Wzrok (except for the lame background vocals). I did not care for either Piosenka Dla Stasia or for Na Calej Polaci Snieg, both of which have neither body nor substance.  While the collaboration between Ms Jopek and Mr Metheny may sound a little out of the ordinary, you may find that it will grow on you as it did on me. The CD comes with a useful booklet containing lyrics (in English) and all pertinent album information. If you have a taste for the slightly exotic, Upojenie may well be something you will enjoy.
B00005JPY2|4.0|Just a brief review since I've just seen the film at the theater & it's still fresh in my head.    This was actually better than I thought it was gonna be. The basic spine of the story of the original comic book mini-series is strong enough to carry the movie along, especialy since Snyder & co. didn't jack w/ it too much.    The main reoccurring thought I had while watching the film was, \\"Gee, I feel really bad for anyone who didn't read the original story before watching this, because they'll probably be incredibly confused.\\" Go ahead & see it w/o reading the graphic novel 1st. But don't say I didn't warn ya not to.
B000RF7XYO|3.0|Elizabeth / B000RF7XYO<br /><br />I love Tudor history, but I'm realistic enough to expect a Tudor movie to not be very historically accurate, so I went into Elizabeth with a pretty open mind, knowing that \\"history\\" and \\"entertainment\\" rarely meet in Hollywood. I'd have to say that \\"Elizabeth\\" does a fair job, but the movie definitely has its faults.<br /><br />Blanchett performs wonderfully as Elizabeth and seems made for the role. I would have preferred that Elizabeth be portrayed as more composed and less nervous, which would be both historically accurate and equally entertaining to me, but I suppose that the filmmakers wanted Blanchett's nervous performance to reflect Elizabeth's inner turmoil. I'm sure it is very difficult to play a calm persona whilst conveying inner uncertainty.<br /><br />Similar complaints abound for Elizabeth's indiscretion in scenes where she openly sleeps with Dudley while her ladies-in-waiting watch nearby - I would venture to guess that the whole scene is supposed to be Hollywood-shorthand for their unrequited love, but the ridiculousness of the scene is a little jarring, and I cannot understand why the directors didn't at least introduce a little more secrecy to the scene.<br /><br />The scenes where Elizabeth comes into her own with gentle barbs and quiet cajoling of her parliament are beautifully handled and are wonderful to behold. Blanchett manages to convey just the right amount of humility and control, humor and iron will to make the scene convincing. Elizabeth's concerns about marriage are conveyed clearly and distinctly, as she frets over the inevitability of losing her power, should she wed. And the scenes where Elizabeth struggles with the realities of power, with the necessities of ruthlessness and aloofness, are perfectly conveyed.<br /><br />I do wish, however, that the movie had employed a little more cunning and subtlety on Elizabeth's part. Historically, she managed to play several suitors on a string while she quietly built her country's defenses and earned her right to independence, yet this subtlety is not conveyed here. Regularly and loudly, she protests that she will never marry, and we see almost nothing of the Spanish suitor whose armada would fare so badly and so infamously against Elizabeth's navy. I was disappointed that none of this came across.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent movie, entertaining enough and with enough kind-of-historical merit to be pleasant to Tudor lovers. I probably wouldn't watch this movie again, though, outside of a one time rental.<br /><br />Oddly, the movie information on the Amazon page lists that English subtitles are included, but the version I received from Blockbuster Online did *not* have English captions for the hard of hearing, only French and Spanish subtitles, so caveat emptor.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardolled her right to independence, yet this subtlety is not conveyed here.

B001W2I9Y4|5.0|I love this album.  A little bit of a departure for Mastodon, leans more on the progrock side, and a little less on the mother puncher/march of the fire ants side.  Might not completely thrill all hard core Mastodon fans, but give it a few listens.  It's awesome... though i think they made the wrong choice with the first single, there are other songs that are better.
B000059XUO|5.0|Brandon Lee gives out his best performance in this film. This is the only adaption of The Crow that's worth buying and the special features on the DVD is a plus. The Crow is also Brandon Lee's last film. This is worthy of collecting just as much as Heath Ledger's final full performance in The Dark Knight as The Joker. I'm naming my son after Brandon Lee.
0123694965|5.0|I've been a professional game designer for over 10 years. This is the best game design book I've ever read - by a wide margin.     In my mind this book is a milestone that demonstrates how the craft of game design has moved in only the last few years from a jumble of principles to a well-understood discipline.     It's well-organized, immediately relevant, deeply insightful, and fun to read.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|I've watched this twice now since I bought it and I was really surprised at what a good \\"sleeper movie\\" it is. Usually when making movies of such great books as James Lee Burke writes, Hollywood has a way of dissapointing. Tommy Lee Jones really pulls off the part of Dave Robicheaux better than anyone else out there that I can think of. He's a complex character, not your average detective, who has many ghosts in his past. For anyone not familier with the books, I think you can still get the gist of him, a good guy that's had his problems but not one to be crossed when he believes in something. Also any movie with Buddy Guy playing a character AND the guitar has to be good! I can't believe with all the bad movies out there, In The Electric Mist didn't do better at the box office. I hope this doesn't keep them from filming more James Lee Burke novels, that would be a shame. I love the stories centered around New Orleans and the bayou, there's just something different and mysterious about them compared to the normal New York City and L.A. stories. I'd love for someone to make \\"Jolie Blon's Bounce\\" into a movie. To me, that is the best Burke book and would make a fantastic movie. Tommy Lee Jones in it would'nt hurt either. In the meantime, buy Electric Mist, It's 105 minutes well spent, even a few times!
B001NFNFIK|4.0|A good movie!<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman and Peter Sarsgaard all star in this movie, based off the book!<br /><br />Most the other reviewers seem to have read the book, I haven't, but I did enjoy the movie anyway.<br /><br />It's not a high budget thriller, its a low budget mystery with a good storyline and great cast.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones (the good guy), John Goodman (one of several bad guys), Ned Beatty and Peter Sarsgaard (the middle man) make this movie work!<br /><br />Great cast, good story, a \\"B\\" movie that probably isn't on your radar, but one that is definitely worth watching!
B0015AARJI|4.0|Just think how much fun these things could be if they really emitted a low voltage \\"attention getter\\" when the bad guys nailed you.  Actually, it's always more fun sniping when you can have a spotter.  Our PS3 only came with one controller.  Now the wife can get in on all the fun too.  The rumble feature is always a nice eye-opener just about the time you approach comatose level.  Great product ... greater price!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Outstanding 1st season!<br /><br />I loved this show!<br /><br />Brian Cranston was hands down \\"phenomenal\\" as Walter White and easily deserved his Emmy. Aaron Paul is awesome in his role as Jesse Pinkman, and all the other cast members seemed to be a perfect fit.<br /><br />I knew the show was good, because of all the rave reviews, but I was'nt expecting it to be this good! \\"Breaking Bad\\" Season 1 has a 5 star overall rating here on Amazon.<br /><br />Great writing, great timing and development of the characters. The storyline is dramatic, hilarious and keeps you watching. Just when you think the story is starting to slow down, they nail you with something big!<br /><br />I watch alot of TV seasons on DVD (The Shield, CSI, Rescue Me), because I work at night. I haven't seen a show in its 1st season that was this good, since \\"Dexter Sea. 1\\"!<br /><br />The only bad part about this show, was that the 1st season was only 7 episodes! Looking forward to the next season already!<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended!
B001CTDH76|1.0|This is nothing more then a ripoff of USA Networks much better show 'Psych'. Don't bother.

B000002KFJ|5.0|Sabbath was getting increasingly better throughout the 70s with each subsequent release. There inital sound was pioneered through there first two groundbreakers before fully forming on 1971's \\"Master of Reality\\" and than moving through even doomier material on \\"Volume Four\\" and getting more progressive with the softer \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\". The band was making classic after classic and by 1975, which became something of a crossroad for the entire genre, they had reached there zenith with this classic.    Sabotage is a complicated and complex Sabbath that is very far away from there earlier grungier sound. An album that complimented that years similarly epic milestones, Zeppelin's \\"Physical Graffiti\\" and Rainbow's \\"Rising\\", quite nicely. In fact the album is probally the equal if not better, of those two Metallic juggernauts.    Metalheads are often very enthusiastic about this album, but the lack of simplified structures inherit within earlier releases still turn off many listeners who only want there Sabbath \\"nice and easy\\" like \\"Paranoid\\". Few seem to have ever aknowledged that the band actually had alot of depth and versatility to them and would do things on there albums that few future Metal artists could ever hope to get away with.    The tracks go like this:    Hole in the Sky-The album opens right with a rocking start with this heavy and fast paced ode against pollution. Ozzy's vocals are right on and this is one of Iommi's coolest riffs of the period. Clearly set a standard for future bands. Not surprised that bands like Metallica and Over Kill have covered it. A classic.    Don't Start(Too Late)-A strange accoustic instrumental that feels a bit urgent, almost the sound of a storm brewing on the horizon. This makes for the perfects et up for the next track....    Symptom of the Universe-An absolute face ripper of a track and one of the top ten best songs the band ever made, this song lives on one of the most influential and hooky riffs ever invented by riff master, Tony Iommi. The songs' still modern sound was a direct influence on the next decade's Thrash bands, many who would cover this and further it's influence. Despite the heaviness, the track is actually a love song(!) and features a beautiful, almost calypso/blues like finale and one of Ozzy's all time greatest vocal performances ever.    Megalomania-Epic as hell, this nearly ten minute classic about insanity is one of the band's best kept secrets. Featuring a multitude of killer riffs and seriously twisted and humorous lyrics by Bassist, Geezer Butler, this may be my personal favorite off the album and a must have in any Sabbath greatest hits. Features probally the best soloing on the album as well.    Thrill of It All-A personal favorite with a terrific build to a classic riff and Ozzy's vocals never better as he shouts for an answer from above! Surprisingly upbeat and with a nice mixture of keyboards and good use of the Bass to still anchor the heaviness. This was one that became a favorite because it was the one I taught a girlfriend how to headbang too! That riff is so infectious...    Supertzar-Strange instrumental with an english chorus that is very epic sounding, not so far removed from Queen or Rainbow, but with a MUCH eviler vibe. This may feel like filler at first, but the track actually fits the opressive feel of the album quite well asnd stands out as one of Sabbath's most accomplished and brilliant works...even without lyrics!    Am I Going Insane(Radio)-Surprisingly poppy sounding on otherwise heavy album features a hooky enough chorus where Ozzy wonders about his insanity. Actually this is quite good and that closer, with all the maniac laughing and guitar seeming to lose control, was a clear inspiration on many future metal acts. This is a track you'll go back too.    The Writ-Imperious and evil feeling with a great driving riff by Iommi and a feel of helplessness that creates more tension than any of there contemporaries. This track may actually be THE Sabbath track. Full of power and energy with deep lyrics and a band at it's full power. The perfect close to this album....well almost. The last thirty seconds are dedicated to a low recorded song entitled, \\"Blow on a Jug\\" which is sung by drummer, Bill Ward, and is pretty hilarious actually! How many metal acts would do that today?    This masterpiece was the peak of the band's powers. Drugs and personal demons affecting there next two records. While they were actually fine albums(especially the melachonic, \\"Technical Ectasy\\") the band fell apart, not to be reinvigorated again untill the arrival of new vocalist, Ronnie James Dio and the monumental, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" in 1980.  Ozzy would find Randy Rhodes and create a surprisingly stellar solo career...for the time being.  Often overlooked among the group's many triumphs, \\"Sabotage\\" stands tall as a reminder to the band's uniqueness and endless creativity. It's heavy and it;s Metal , but it's alot more than that. Sabotage is one of the essential albums of the 1970s and a testament to the birth of a great genre.    It also happens to be my personal favorite Sabbath album ever made.
B00006D295|5.0|This is one of the best campy cult movies every made.  Anyone in for a good laugh and a great musical, this is the one you want.
B001N26GFC|3.0|I was rather disappointed in the movie overall.  The bits and pieces that are used to create the movie trailer were in fact the best parts of the film.    Sadly, there was so much potential to make this movie into something magnificent, but it just faltered.   I would have thought it would have been better to see someone in their early 20's with Poppy's attitude.  When I learn that she is now 30 and acting so immature, it really makes the film less credible.    I would highly recommend folks rent the movie before buying this.  It was not the best $20 investment that I ever made.
B00004RYZT|5.0|I had a copy of the Google version of this show already, but I decided to become more honest and buy this DVD.  I also got the Völkerball show DVD.  I consider these my old millenium and new millenium Rammstein show disks.  This disk has a wonderful show intro, with the boys appearing in poofs of spotlight.  Then Flake strikes a keyboard motive and Till descends to the stage in a shower of sparks.  The song Spiel is started.  The boys are in silvery makeup, lending eerie backdrop to the onstage fireworks.  There is a lot to love in this concert: the firebrands held on the stage set during the song \\"Wilder Wein\\", fabulous-looking Bobolina in the cage for the song \\"Engel\\".  Finally, the closing and extro with the song \\"Seeman\\", while keyboardist Flake sails the mighty mosh pit.  And I must not fail to mention: fireworks, flamethrowers, synchronized searchlights.  It looked like one great evening in a park in Berlin.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Excellent continuation of Casino Royale.  Quantum of Solace continues the character development of the new James Bond.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|Mastodon is a rare band in the metal community; one that both enjoys and is cursed by a sort-of ongoing \\"sophomore album\\" syndrome. Every release is so punishing in it's technical proficiency and expertly crafted songwriting methods that the inevitable question is asked on the dawn of each new release: \\"Can they top that?\\" Ye of little faith prepare to be destroyed. However much Leviathan reinvented metal for you or Blood Mountain took your preconceptions of extreme music and spun them upside-down into a product which seamlessly blended infectious hooks and world-class musicianship, Crack The Skye has Mastodon outdoing themselves once again.    The sound quality has become significantly better than past Mastodon releases with A-list producer Brendan O'Brien behind the mixing board, utilizing cutting edge sound manipulation while maintaining the gritty, raw sound which captures the massive wingspan of the ferocious musical beast that is Mastodon. The instrumentation follows in suit and will be no surprise to longtime fans. Hinds and Kelliher's guitars weave fluidly together like a pair of crushing pythons locked in a twisted yet beautiful discordant harmony, backed by Troy Sanders' dependably thundering basslines and Brann Dailor's jazzy and seemingly 8-armed drum style.    As for the album itself, it's structure lays waste to the modern music critic theory of the concept album being dead. With lyrics weaving together a violent plot of Czarist Russia and out-of-body terrestrial experiences which simultaneously convey deep meaning and utter ambiguity, the room for interpretation is limitless. In a world where music is cheaply stolen off the Internet with few consequences, this most cohesive of \\"was that just 1 song or 10?\\" recordings demands your hard-earned money and a spin on a good stereo. And no, your iPod doesn't count. When buying, expect exactly what you got last time you bought a Mastodon album: positively shattered expectations and the deja vous-like conviction that they'll never be able to top themselves this time. Of course, you were wrong then and will doubtlessly be again as long as the Mastodon breathes.
B001HY3BFE|1.0|This has to be their worst(or second to worst) release ever.Not a single song to remember.

B001R4MEYI|5.0|Like their name implies, Mastodon is an unstoppable force that keeps delivering amazing albums without so much as a stumble. And with their fourth album Crack the Skye, they don't disappoint.   It's clear from the first listen that mastodon has indeed changed. Screaming vocals while still present, are limited. Vocals are contributed by all four members, and mostly consist of melodic clean singing, harmonizing, and numerous of vocal effects. In addition this is probably, the softest album Mastodon has produced. While some might call this \\"selling out\\", it's worth noting that mastodon has never been a \\"run-of-the-mill\\" metal band. They have always been if not the most, one of the most creative metal bands on the scene. This band will only get bigger, and I believe years from now they will remembered as the greatest bands of the 21st century. Upon first listen you may not like this album, but give it a second listen like I did, and if you got the dvd, it will definately help you understand the album alot more. I didn't rate the songs, because upon completion they all got a 5/5.    Oblivion- If Mastodon and Pink Floyd did it, this would be the baby, Brann Dailor on lead vocals, also wrote the lyrics. Brent Hinds delivers an amazing David Gilmourish solo on this one. One of the shorter tracks, but it makes no compromises on the awesomeness scale.    Divinations- Great song, anyone following Mastodon has heard it by now most reminiscent of their older work (Blood mountain, Leviathan, Remission) than any other track on Crack the Skye. Guitars are heavy, Brann's signature drumming, a little screaming vocals, sick solo. Simply put, if you don't like this song, you never liked Mastodon.    Quintessence- My favorite track on the album as of now.It has this great semi-clean melodic guitar riff throughout it that really is the bread and butter of the song. I hated the chorus initially, as I felt it didn't really fit with the song, but it eventually grew on me. Drumming is spot on and meshes perfectly with the song as usual. Song seems to be speeding up just a tad after every chorus (might just be me). Brent and Bill have this crazy trade off. Brent playing the song's cleaner main riff, and Bill playing this really heavy one that sets up for the breakdown. Pretty cool breakdown in the end as well.    The Czar- One of Mastodon's 2 epics on the album (any song that lasts over 8 minutes I call an \\"epic\\" or an \\"attempted epic\\") Allegedly this song has 4 parts. Every time I listen to it I try to figure out where each part starts and ends, and while discernable to the disciplined listner, I always get to engrossed into the song to be that diligent.   The track starts off slow with a clean, sort of spacey feel to it, with alot of different sounds popping in here and there. A heavy breakdown cuts in and it turns to a very upbeat funky metal kinda thing. Then it returns back to the beginning with some cool mini guitar solos in it. I trying to condense this one, because you could write a 2 page essay on it. Just know great track, Troy Sanders bass gets the spotlight, So if your a bass player, this just became one of your standards.    Ghost of Karelia- BRANN DAILOR! The name alone sums up this track. Probably his best drumming on the album. This one is hard to describe, Its constantly changing everything from themes, tempos, themes, time signatures,and underpants, and goes from soft to heavy in a split second. This is Brann Dailor's forte, and the reason why I think he shines on this track.    Crack the Skye- Some really slow heavy sludge like riffs, and a soaring chorus that's backed by some heavy double bass pedal action. Some screaming vocals thrown around in there too. Another one that switches around a lot,but a little tamer than Ghost's.Probably doesn't sound like much from my description, but still a must listen.    The Last Baron- \\"the last baron... THE LAST BAROOOOOON!\\". Indescribable, can't wait to hear live, perfect ending to a perfect album.    I tried to describe the tracks as best I could, but describing them are nearly impossible with out me shoving earphones in your ears. Trust me, it's a must buy, not only for Mastodon fans, but for any metal fan willing up his mind, and realize that music doesn't have to be constantly fast and heavy to be great music.
1572814349|5.0|This was the first tarot deck I purchased which I truly felt in tune.  I think the secret to this tarot deck specifically is that it utilizes older images and artwork to create unique tarot images, thereby giving the deck the beauty of the Renaissance.  The Golden Tarot will invoke the Golden Age of Elizabeth and also some darker imagery which will satisfy any Anglophile, yet there is also images which call upon the mystical traditions of alchemy and Catholic esoterica.  You may easily find yourself turning to this deck before you turn to the Rider-Waite deck purely because it is much nicer to look at.  The only beef is that the corresponding book doesn't give satisfying descriptions of the cards,but most tarot readers have a small library of books on the tarot that totally make up for it.
B001JRB16U|4.0|It took me 40 years before I finally saw this film, in December 2004 shortly after it had come out with a two-disc DVD. After the first half hour I thought, \\"Wow, I can see why this is such a beloved movie\\" but after that it started to lag in a number of areas and the songs were just too numerous. It seemed to go on way too long.     Yet, it's a good film worthy of anyone's collection and the DVD transfer is very good: nice rich colors and reasonably sharp for a now 45- year-old film. There are some nice extras in here, too.  Andrews is wholesomely pretty and Glynis Johns, even with her strange voice, also is appealing. The kids are kind of stupid-looking, as are their parents.    The other major character, the chimney sweep played by Dick Van Dyke, is a likable chap, but hard to understand with this cockney impression. However, on the DVD, one can use the English subtitles when he speaks. Van Dyke surprised me with his singing and dancing talent. I didn't know he was that proficient.    The movie was one of the first efforts at mixing real life with animation and they did it well. It still holds up today.
B00005JKGZ|4.0|I would think this classic movie  is more appealing to a female than a male, but all should enjoy it.  It centers more on romances than on anything else.  Whatever it's labeled, it sure looks good on this two-disc `Special Edition.\\"  Wow!  The print is fantastic, and extra features are worth checking out.    Child actor Margaret O'Brien, in her first starring role, is okay but a little annoying with her emoting. She sure was a ham in her child acting career in the 1940s. Judy Garland, meanwhile, well.....I certainly can't knock her voice/ Leon Ames, as head \\"Mr. Alonzo Smith,\\" of the household, played the most likable character, followed by Harry Davenport as the grandpa.    As for the music, \\"The Trolley Song\\" was my favorite although I admit I found myself humming the title tune for several days after watching this. Although billed as a musical, the stories in here were played up much more than the songs, of which there were only a half dozen.    The costuming of the ladies and of the period (turn of the 20th century) were beautiful, as was the Technicolor. If you enjoy color, this is pretty film to watch.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|This is a fine movie, one of the Steven Spielberg's best efforts. Yes, he gets a little preachy in the end but overall, this is enjoyable and top-notch film-making.    Even though this had some violent moments, what impressed me was the restraint not to overdo the violence. I thought there was just the right amount. Being a long movie at two hours, 45 minutes, too much action would have worn out the viewer and too little would bore he/she.     It also was fascinating to me as almost a travelogue, seeing a lot of different cities around the world, following this team of Israelis as they track down and kill many of the men responsible for murdering hostages in the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.    That's the story of this film: not what happened at the Olympics, but how the Israelis tracked down the killers/terrorists afterward.    Some of the violence is room-shaking if you have good speakers as a few of the explosions felt like it made my room shake when they went off! However much of the film deals not with that but with the men involved and how this mission affected them. In the end, Spielberg gives us a chance to reflect on a big question: how do you respond to terrorist attacks?  Basically, it is his view vs. how Israel responds. (Israel wasn't real pleased with this film, and I understand that. I think they are right, but I still love the film.)    The movie is well-acted and has a story that will keep most people very involved while watching it. We plunk our dollars down to get entertained....and this movie delivers. Highly recommended.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|In terms of humor or songs, I can't honestly rank this was high as most of the other Muppet films BUT it may be the most touching version of the Dickens classic story I've ever seen on film.    The lyrics to the last two songs are fantastic: very Christian-like and very profound. Scrooge (Michael Caine), meanwhile, is not portrayed as some screaming maniac as he so often is in other versions. His transformation from cold-hearted tightwad to caring, generous person is done more subtly, too, than in other films. However, to be fair, sometimes the slapstick humor in here gets in the way of the touching story.    The last part of the movie is a lot sentimental drama than Muppet comedy and I found that refreshing. Not much offensive in here, either, making this a good film for little ones as well as  us older, sentimental folks.
0333963962|5.0|This is one of my favourite books and of course my kids love it too! The story helps kids understand the concept of sharing and sacrificing things in order to help others. Georges tie was a scarf for a cold giraffe, his shirt was on a boat as a sail for a goat, his shoe was house for a little white mouse, his sock was a bed for a fox and his belt helped a dog cross a bog! But George did not fret and believed that he was still the smartest giant in town. It helps children build confidence in themselves and understand that material things are not all that important! I would recommend this book to all kids..
1416550534|5.0|This book is the kind of book that makes me feel alive, and a kindred spirit with the human race.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|First I will say that I love Mastodon, have since March of the Fire Ants. But as mentioned in previous reviews, they keep getting better and better. This album is bar far my favorite as an entire listening experience this band has created yet. I would recommend a good set of headphones, close your eyes and drift away. Hell, after headphones I put it on the stereo and my girlfriend loved it too! Mastodon is one of the greats and are building are really cool history and it is awesome to be a part of it unfolding. This band will be looked back upon as something special...
B001GSV3EC|4.0|Jeff Beck doesn't need to prove how good he is. Watching his interviews you realise why he never reached the stratosphere of his contemporaries like Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton, but he has managed to retain his youthful looks in the process. I would have thought it a no-brainer to perform in such intimate surroundings as Ronnie's  but it looked like Jeff needed some convincing on that regard. The Stones managed to come out of the god-awful enormodomes they play in and got Scorcese no less to shoot on Shine a Light. This is about as good as it is gonna get for Jeff. For a man of 64 he looks half the age of Keef and poor Jimmy looks like his grandad. All the hits are there and they sound duly freshened up. Stratus, Led Boots and Day in the Life are worth the price of admission E.C gave us his autobiography,Jimmy gave us his one-off Zeppelin concert and Beck here has given a most enjoyable summation of a great career.
B00005RDRO|5.0|For a long, long time this has been one of the most fun movies I've ever watched.  In a recent viewing, it seemed a bit sleazier than I had remembered from the last time but, nonetheless, it still has tons of laughs.    This film has one of my all-time favorite characters: \\"Sidney Wang,\\" played by Peter Sellers. The late English actor did a fabulous job of imitating Charlie Chan. He is the highlight among a very talented cast that includes Peter Falk, David Niven, James Coco, Elsa Lanchester, Alec Guinesses, Maggie Smith, Nancy Walker and Truman Capote.    Today, the character oddest for me to view is a young James Cromwell who speaks with a French accent! I've never seen him in any role remotely resembling this. The other actors play roles typical of them, such as Niven and Smith's dapper \\"Thin Man\\" couple and Falk's, Columbo/Mike Hammer-style American detective.    This spoof of  great fictional writers and detectives  has a purposely exaggerated amount of twists, particularly at the end. Entertainment-wise, start-to-finish it is fun with absolutely no lulls. It's a classic!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, non-stop action.  Good acting, writing, and directing.  If you enjoy superhero movies you have to own this one, on Blu Ray the sound and picture are 10 times more enjoyable than the standard definition version of this movie.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Wow, what a sordid-but-sentimental and fascinating film. I can why Mickey Rourke won so many awards for his performance, too. The same goes for the film.    The film was shocking to me: For instance, it was a shock seeing Rourke -\\"Randy The Ram\\" -  with the long, flowing blond hair and rippling muscles. Hey, it's not that the former real-life boxer was ever in bad shape, but he never had muscles like this either. The man must have pumped a lot of iron to get ready for this role as an aging wrestler.    Another shock was seeing Marisa Tomei, of \\"My Cousin Vinny\\" fame, naked - and in that state in more than one scene. She didn't leave much to the imagination as \\"Cassidy.\\"    A third shock was seeing some of the early wrestling scenes. Yeah, pro wrestling is rough stuff and it's bloody and it's fake, etc., but the scenes in here are pretty brutal, more than I've ever seen on TV. The one extended match with the \\"staples\\" was pretty gruesome.    Evan Rachel Wood is convincing as Randy's daughter \\"Stephanie.\\"  This 21-year-old is no stranger to acting, having been doing it since she was four!  The scenes with her and her dad are memorable.    When the shock of the above scenes of sex and violence (and language) fade away, underneath it all is a very tender, sad tale of a lonely man who invested too much in his career and, after coming close to mortality, realizes the important of family and simply being loved by anyone.  That's what sticks with you long after the film ends.  Loneliness can be a killer.    \\"Randy\\" tries to mend fences and post a few himself - in his final quest not to wind up as an island in this world of humanity - with both successful and unsucessful results.  Sometimes you can never change what you are, and sometimes you can. Both of those are demonstrated here in this oddly-edgy-but sentimental film.
0812979656|1.0|My friend gave me this novel to borrow because of its \\"beautiful language.\\"  I started reading it about six months ago and have about 40 pages left with no intention of finishing.  To be blunt, this book rambles incessantly.  Relationship scenes are more creepy than touching, it's hard to even care about the fate of the characters.  The novel winds in and out of so many multiple page metaphors that it's easy to forget what the point was in the first place.  I found myself rolling my eyes at ridiculous wording, especially when it was completely irrelevant to the topic.
0385338694|3.0|[[ASIN:1934572039 Aberrations]]<br /><br />From my latest Aberration Nation [...] blog post:<br /><br />Last week I had the opportunity to take a 12-hour road trip across Texas with my 66-year-old mother. She talked a lot about the way things used to be when she was growing up in the 1950s. She enjoyed going on about how everyone was so much more polite, well-groomed, and decent. I was surprised to hear that my grandmother required my mom and her siblings to make their beds when they stayed in hotels.<br /><br />Hotels!<br /><br />My mother graduated from high school in 1960. Richard Yates' Revolutionary Road was published in 1961. Ironically, I was getting this earful about life in the '50s just as I was finishing Yates' novel. Flying back to Philly from Dallas, I thought about the perfect picture of domestication my mother grew up with, and how she still wishes life could be that way. Truth be told, she wishes I could be that way. (Confession: I rarely make the beds in my own home much less hotels.) I also considered what I'd like to say about Revolutionary Road.<br /><br />Another detail swirling in my head was the fact that I finally read a novel officially categorized as Chick Lit just prior to reading Revolutionary Road. It was Sophie Kinsella's The Undomestic Goddess. One word to describe my reaction: disappointed. Of course, lots of folks buy Kinsella's novels, and I admit that her work, along with the rest of successful Chick Lit, has its place on the shelf, and probably on sandy beaches everywhere. But I take the word literature seriously ... maybe too seriously.<br /><br />Before my first Chick Lit experience, I assumed these books were for hip, intelligent women who love literature. Isn't literature supposed to mean something more than hot embraces, palatial homes, awesome shoes, and perfect endings filled with train station embraces? If not, than I was an official chick at eleven. That was the fateful year I discovered the thrill of the harlequin romance. My love lasted about four months--the amount of time it took me to figure out the formula and lose interest.<br /><br />Now that I'm a woman who can bring home some sort of bacon, I want what I've decided to call, Wit Lit. And yes, Wit Lit can appeal to men as well because although we're apparently from different planets, we share good ole' human nature in all its simple and fascinating complexity--the very element Yates tapped into when he wrote Revolutionary Road in 1961. Yates' novel qualifies as Wit Lit because it's 20-21th century literature that brilliantly provokes relevant, close-to-home thought in the reader. The fact that it was written in 1961 is significant in that the particular questions Yates poses were unexpected and bold within the context of my mother's graduating class. These American kids were poised to waltz out into the world and set up houses with nice white picket fences, swing sets, and husbands who wore suits to work while the girls stayed home and baked to ensure the home smelled yummy for hubby's return. Yates gave them something to think about, and he gives us something to think about today. Thus another criterion for Wit Lit: timeless.<br /><br />In Revolutionary Road, Yates masterfully uses the one certifiably crazy character, John Givings, to deliver truth to a bunch of neighborhood chicks and dudes who, despite their wonderful, intelligent qualities, find themselves caught in the cultural quagmire of the 1950's my mother so misses. This crazy guy, John, seems to have much to give, however lacking the acceptable 1950's social skills, he's been wheeled out of town to an institution. His parents define him as unstable and ill, yet Yates never provides facts to support why he's been classified this way. John actually seems to know what he's talking about in a room full of people struggling to put up all the kinds of fronts that maintain the perfect picture John has escaped.<br /><br />The Wheelers and main characters, Frank and April,have much to offer to each other, their children, and themselves, but they can't seem to pull past bitter disappointment as they fail to physically escape the Norman Rockwell life they've been pressured to emulate. Yates brilliantly casts an inner pallor over the white picket fences, swing sets, yummy smells, and pressed suits of that stifling world. Frank and April aptly recognize that pallor yet fail to grasp the magnitude of choices within their reach. Frank describes the culture he longs to escape like this:<br /><br />\\"Christ's sake, when it comes to any kind of a showdown we're still in the Middle Ages. It's as if everyone'd made this tacit agreement to live in a state of total self-deception. The hell with reality! Let's have a whole bunch of cute little winding and cute little houses painted white and pink and baby blue; let's all be good consumers and have a lot of Togetherness and bring our children up in a bath of sentimentality--Daddy's a great man because he makes a living, Mummy's a great woman because she's stuck by Daddy all these years--and if old reality ever does pop out and say Boo we'll all get busy and pretend it never happened.\\"<br /><br />However, reality is all around Frank. He falls prey to the sad unreality he longs to escape through his inability to honestly express himself in nearly all his relationships.<br /><br />He describes his work like this: \\"I mean the great advantage of a place like Knox is that you can sort of turn off your mind every morning at nine and leave it off all day, and nobody knows the difference,\\" yet he misses opportunities to tap into his intellect at Knox because he's blinded by his own ideas of escape.<br /><br />The fate of those on Yates' Revolutionary Road shows that revolution comes from within. It doesn't matter what town, road, or home you live in. Yates deftly relays how revolutionary moments, decisions, and actions can be missed if we fail to look inward rather than outward. Interestingly, another character, the Wheeler's neighbor, Shep Campbell, grew up in the sort of high-brow intellectual, arty world to which the Wheelers long to escape. Ironically, Shep spent his younger adult years desperate to break out of that particular mold by settling himself into the cookie cutter world of Revolutionary Road. He comes to realize that he doesn't want to live on the street either--thus we see another character searching outward rather than inward.<br /><br />In one cool Chick versus Wit moment of the novel, John Givings says to Frank, \\"I like your girl, Wheeler ... I get the feeling she's female. You know what the difference between female and feminine is? Huh? Well, here's a hint: a feminine woman never laughs out loud and always shaves her armpits. Old Helen (his mom) is feminine as hell. I've only met about half a dozen females in my life, and I think you got one of them here. Course, come to think of it, that figures. I get the feeling you're male. There aren't too many males around, either.\\"<br /><br />If she existed in 2009, John Giving's mom, Helen, would probably enjoy Sophie Kinsella's work. If, like Helen, you prefer to escape the real world, whether through the purchase of a nice white fence, a corporate job that keeps you too busy to feel, or religious services that don't require real contemplation, stick to reading Chick Lit. In The Undomestic Goddess, Kinsella's characters always say exactly what they're thinking and feeling. Her conflicts are vastly situational rather than internal. The characters may have been quite comfortable on Revolutionary Road back in the `50s. I suspect Kinsella could have nicely resolved Frank and April's issues with a lot of superb communication, and a nice summer trip to the EU. We'd all be smiling with stars in our eyes but somehow less enlightened about the true nature of humanity.<br /><br />So, if you prefer to open an eye or two to the complexity, inconsistency, creativity, and hidden beauty of reality, pick up RevolutionaryRoad, and hope that today's emerging writers can perpetuate truth the way Yates did in 1961. Demand more Wit Lit! Walk past the chicks and dudes, and take the train toward being real females and males who search inward for answers rather than grasping at all the turn of the century machinations our society imposes. There are still a heck of a lot of streets like Revolutionary Road in our towns and cities. Just because we may live there, doesn't mean we're trapped.o which the Wheelers long to escape.

1416914307|5.0|The final book of the trilogy was fantastic!  I read it in one day since I couldn't put it down.  Even though I found the plot to be rather transparent when it came to Clary, Jace and the new mystery man Sebastian I still found it very engaging which says a lot for me.  Typically if I can figure out what's going to happen the books loses something but the characters in the series are so alive and there were enough smaller, finer details that I didn't foresee that it kept me totally hooked.  It's really gratifying to see Clary and Simon in particular come into their own, to accept who they are and what they can do.  Jace has always been powerful and strong but that front he puts up finally cracks and you get the emotional development with his character that you haven't seen as much in the other books.  Alec and Isabelle also have their moments of maturity and self-realization.  I wish there had been a little more Valentine than the rushed part at the end but it's a small complaint.  I'd highly recommend this series and not just to the young adult audience.  I'm a few years beyond that description and found the characters and story really entertaining even though the plot was often easy to predict.  It's always bittersweet to come to the ending of a series but it was a great ride!!
B000YABYLA|5.0|Stylized the dialogue may be - do 16 year olds really talk like this now? I doubt it - but this movie really entertains, despite it's soap-opera plot about a teen preggers and the yuppie couple that wants the baby. I was mesmerized. The soundtrack is a bit precious, but still likeable in the end. You'll foresee the outcome from the first 5 minutes, but this isn't a suspense tale. It's meant to say something about the human condition, and it succeeds.
B001N18HOQ|4.0|First off, I was annoyed that to get the Mamasan cassette and the scrapbook I needed to spend $150 and get a bunch of LP's.  I don't have a record player and I'm not some collector.  I just wanted a shot at those things without being charged an arm and a leg.  I decided on just getting the Deluxe version and picking up the rest on ebay in the future.  An option to get the Unplugged on disk(remastered) would have been a nice alternative too.<br /><br />The album itself is an obvious gem.  TEN is not even close to my favorite Pearl Jam album, but I would be stupid not to understand what a groundbreaking album it was almost 20 years ago.  The remastered part of things sounds great.  It is just a louder and crisper version of the 1991 disk.  It's a typical remaster that you see all the time with older albums.  My main beef is why couldn't the bonus songs on the \\"remixed\\" side be on the remaster side?  I was dying to have a remastered Breath, Brother, Just a Girl, and State of Love and Trust for my collection.<br /><br />On the remixed side of things, it was pretty much hit or miss.  Overall, I like it, but a few of the tracks blew and I wished I could have just gotten the originals.  Jeremy, State of Love and Trust, and Brother sounded awful, while Why Go, Oceans and Garden were awesome.<br /><br />I guess at the end of the day the band can't please everyone.  I can't figure out why some of the cooler memoribilia got stuck with the pricey LP's, and I sure would have liked to see Brother, Just a Girl, and SOLAT untouched from their original(and superior) state.  Even with the problems I stated, this was a cool idea, and I look forward to the VS remaster and remix in a few months.
B001TH16DI|1.0|This release should not just include the first six movies it should include the next generation movies as well.  This release should include both versions (Theatrical and Directors Cut) of each film that are available.  The studio needs to invest a few bucks and give these films a true blu-ray make over.  These films and the characters in them are cultural icons and should be treated as such. Until these films get the proper treatment I'll just stick to my standard DVDs.
B000024LIX|4.0|Moseley Shoals being OCS 1996 release and their 2nd studio album and was a major sucess in England reaching #2 in the album charts. Songs that are of particular interest on this record are \\"The Day we Caught the Train\\", \\"You've Got It Bad\\" and  \\"The Circle\\". The booklet is fairly straightforward in that has standard rock photos of the band on the cover, all lyrics are included and we get a listing of what each band member plays. 4/5.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|What is so brilliant about WALL-E is simple: For the first hour or so you don't even realize you are watching a silent film. Beyond the musicians on WALL-E's TV, or the advertisments being broadcast from before Earth's fall into ruin, there is no dialouge. That makes it all the more enticing to watch as WALL-E makes his way through the earth that is now wasteland, showing all those incredible human emotions that we are selves are in touch with everyday, but probably don't hold neary as dear as the protaginist in this film.<br /><br />Without going into all the breakdowns of the film and all the incredible praised it has well earned, for those who are looking for excellent films to test their hardware on, WALL-E is one of them.  The colors in this film are vibrant, bold and beautiful, and with the right hardware it is an absolute treat to behold.  A great upscaling DVD or excellent blu ray player can bring this film to life the way it was meant to be, outside of the movie theater experience.<br /><br />It is also an excellent test for your music system, as the sounds are bold an subtle at the same time and a great workout for your audio system. That, and the Dark Knight are my two test dvd's when it comes to testing audio and visual.<br /><br />Beyond this enjoy and savor this film if you are coming to it for the first time.  If hollywood created magic like this all the time, the world would be a much happier place!

B001MVYUPC|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites.  The transfer to blu ray is excellent considering how long ago the movie was filmed.  There's a bunch of extras, which I think are the same as the DVD version.  I think this is a great addition to your collection especially if you're a Ben Kingsley fan or love historical dramas
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Excellent! The tunes are well-written. Accompaniment is great! Although the songs were all new to me, this has quickly become a favorite CD.

0345495004|4.0|Brief summary, no spoiler -<br /><br />This is the fictionalization of the affair between Frank Lloyd Wright, and Mamah Borthwick Cheney, that started in the early 1900s. We hear about Mamah's life, and see the story through her eyes.<br /><br />Both FLW and Mamah left their respective families for each other, and did so in a time and place that showed no mercy for this type of action. While people in Europe were more welcoming to  them, in America, their relationship was scandalized.<br /><br />The fact is that the story (and the relationship) ended by a shocking event, yet for me, the draw of this book was Mamah's story. I thought the book was well written, and it was definitely a page-turner. I could not wait to get back to it when I put it down.<br /><br />My only criticism is that in order to tell the story, the author obviously had to take great leeway in trying to put herself in Mamah's shoes (and mind.) On the whole, the story worked, but I did find myself frustrated at points because I thought that her attitude and thoughts were at times inconsistent, almost forced, and used more as a way for the plot to proceed.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommended. I had never heard of Mamah Cheney before this, and her life, and relationship with FLW makes for a very interesting story. Shocking denouement withstanding.<br /><br />Also, highly recommended for book clubs, because I guarantee you, everyone is going to have a different view of Mamah, and different opinions about the decisions she made.
B000002I97|5.0|I was trying to remember whether I bought this album before or after I heard him at Willie's 1st picnic in '73.  I haven't heard the whole album in ages but the songs keep coming back to me.  In the news today, the Obama administration halted mountain-top mining, for a while, I guess.  Sadly, what the coal trains haven't hauled off has been just pushed over the side, devastating the environment for miles around.  Another Paradise lost.  Illegal Smile, Sam Stone, Angel... Can't forget them, so I found my way here to buy the CD, since the old phono is in the junk closet.  I'm looking forward to sharing JP with my daughter, a big Dixie Chicks fan.  If you're already a JP fan and haven't seen the \\"song notes\\" for this album, www jpshrine org/lyrics/index html.  Fascinating.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|I like most Bond films. Casino Royale was a great first installment in the 'Reboot' of the Franchise. Daniel Craig makes a very good Bond ranking right up there with Connery and Moore. I've read a bunch of the 1 star reviews and some make valid points. The action sequences are edited very tightly which make it hard to follow at times. However I disagree with the assessment that the locations were dull or unimaginative. I thought that they looked very Bond-ish. And more specifically one review stated there was no who/what/when/where/why. And I strongly disagree with that. (Spoiler Alert) The movie gave us who - Quantum, a mysterious evil organization. They gave us what - They are willing to overthrow governments if those governments don't agree to help Quantum. They gave us when - takes place immediately following Casino Royale. They gave us where - Quantum is actively trying to install a new government in Bolivia. I do admit that they didn't really give us the why - presumably for world domination, does an evil organization need more than that? But it did give us why Bond is after them - it was Quantum that was behind the death of Vesper Lind, Bond's love from Casino Royale. It seems to be all there.    My favorite thing about the last 2 Bond films is that they don't cheapen anything. They don't dumb down anything. This is a well thought out piece of work. Had the editing been a bit better on the action sequences, I easily would have given this 5 stars.

B000Y7U98W|4.0|In the realm of science-fiction cinema, rarely does a film exhibit new ideas regarding plot. Director Danny Boyle's new sci-fi thriller, \\"Sunshine,\\" adheres to the general plotline of its predecessors \\"Armageddon\\" and \\"The Core,\\" where a highly capable team is dispatched to prevent the destruction of humanity. In this case, it's to revive our dying Sun via nuclear blast. The structure is cliché, but amidst the impressive special effects and grand camera shots lays an intriguing commentary on the human condition when in dire situations.     While Earth remains crippled in a solar winter, a team of eight, comprised of mathematicians and physicists, board the Icarus II with the task of re-igniting the Sun with a massive payload. The crew struggles to cope with the responsibility of their mission, coming to question rationality and their own judgment. After a minor miscalculation jeopardizes the entire mission by diminishing the oxygen supply, head physicist, Capa (Cillian Murphy) is forced to lead an assignment to locate Icarus I, which vanished seven years prior for unknown reasons. Their plan must succeed if they ever hope to reach the payload's destination and save humankind.    Set in 2057, \\"Sunshine\\" portrays the future with numerous logical fallacies, however, everything is breathtakingly convincing through the impressive cinematography and art direction. The Sun's overwhelming, golden sheen cascades across the surface of Icarus II while its interior features a multitude of monitors, holograms, data analyzers, and lush oxygen garden. It never loses believability and will continually leave viewers in awe.    Composer John Murphy, alongside the electronic band Underworld, pieces together the trance-like soundtrack. Every ominous chord and verberation supports the dreary, tense nature of the crew's harrowing journey. The most insignificant clanks of the ship strengthens the isolated atmosphere while the cryptic, aged distress signal from the Icarus I instills a sense of dread. Each facet of design blends beautifully, creating a cinematic masterpiece.    The actors capture the reoccurring discord throughout \\"Sunshine,\\" arguing and even physically fighting amongst one another. While most of their performances are forgetful when compared to the greater presence of atmosphere, Cillian Murphy is incredibly convincing as Capa. Through the desperation in his voice and actions, Murphy embodies the dedication of the crew and portrays the caliber of their mission.    Much of \\"Sunshine\\" is slow paced, building up to the conclusion, which is ultimately quite disappointing. The themes emphasized earlier in the film become convoluted in the final act, relinquishing them for a god-complex. Also, an antagonist is introduced when the film clearly doesn't need one. The oppressiveness of the circumstances themselves is enough. Although the initial aspirations of \\"Sunshine\\" are lost in its B-movie, slasher-esque finale, the film does tie up nicely. It's just unfortunate that an essence Boyle's 2002 zombie-thriller \\"28 Days Later\\" somehow nudged itself into this film.     \\"Sunshine\\" is an ambitious film, rampant with atmosphere and featuring a compelling look at human nature. Although this ambition is detrimental to the last quarter of the film, it still manages to form a provocative piece of cinema that will undoubtedly appeal to those who want substance with their visual flair.
B001GQSY5U|5.0|Regardless of what many fans had said about this movie being CGI instead of live action/ digital magic, I love the movie. It is Star Wars through and through. This process shows what was only alluded to in the other realeses. Buy the special edition.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Someone in the theater lobby described \\"The Fall\\" as a cross between \\"The Princess Bride\\" and \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not a bad combo, I thought. Sure enough, the movie is mind-blowing: epic, imaginative, heartfelt.<br /><br />Tarsem, a commercial and music video director, self-financed this visually stunning labor of love, filmed over years in over a dozen countries. The product is a lavish, inventive, and darkly imaginative spectacle. A woman is trapped in a labyrinth, birds fly from a shaman's mouth, island-exiled bandits hitch a ride with a seafaring elephant, and crimson blood slowly seeps across a cloth tower a hundred feet high. It's all part of a magical yarn that an injured Hollywood stuntman is spinning for the benefit of a fellow hospital inmate: 5-year old Romanian girl, Alexandria. What begins as an endearing, odd-couple friendship between two convalescents turns dark when the stuntman, named Roy, depressed by a break-up with his leading lady, asks his naive new friend to steal morphine for him. Earlier he'd asked her another question, \\"Are you trying to save my soul?\\"<br /><br />She is, and his story may prove his redemption. The two strands, fantasy and reality, interweave more tightly as the movie unfolds, and it becomes clear to us (and Alexandria) that the outcome of the fantasy will determine the outcome of reality. Tarsem paints the screen in saturated colors framed in majestic compositions, but there is substance behind the eye-popping surface style. \\"The Fall\\" is about storytelling, movies, and our collective trust in narrators to do the right thing by their sub-created characters -- it is a form of morality. Though mind-bending images are Tarsem's calling card (and they are in full flower here), \\"The Fall\\" succeeds where his earlier film, The Cell, failed: as an emotionally involving story. The girl brings light and hope to Roy, the despairing stuntman. He is redeemed through the young girl's simple act of self-giving, and her total trust in him to provide the right ending. It's a beautiful tale, and the painterly photography is just icing on the cake.ight ending. It's a beautiful tale, and the painterly photography is just icing on the cake.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|A couple of years ago the American Film Institute named the Top Ten American Animated Films.  The top three were SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, PINOCCHIO, and BAMBI, in that order.  But I thought then and I believe now that this was simply wrong.  I understand why SNOW WHITE was placed first.  It was the first feature length animated film and as such created an entire genre of films.  And in recently rewatching the film I was struck at the very many things that are still very interesting in it.  But to watch SNOW WHITE you get a strong sense that it was from a different period in time.  It feels extremely dated and, frankly, many parts of it has not held up very well.  And while it was brilliantly animated, it is vastly less impressive than either PINOCCHIO or BAMBI.  If you take away its historical importance as the first of a new genre, it simply is not anywhere near the movie that these other two films are.  I strongly believe that PINOCCHIO and BAMBI should have headed the list.  Moreover, in assessing the greatness of these two films, you don't even need to qualify them as \\"animated films.\\"  They are simply great movies, period.<br /><br />Some critics have taken issue with some plot alterations in PINOCCHIO, but apart from that it is close to impossible to quibble with any other aspect of the film.  The animation set the standard for anything else in the genre that came after.  The music is arguably the finest not merely of any Disney film, but any animated film ever done.  The voice acting -- especially that of Cliff Edwards as Jiminy Cricket -- is beyond reproach.  Unless one favors alternative story directions, this is a movie that is pretty close beyond criticism.  And unlike SNOW WHITE, it is as fresh today as the week it came out.  There is a timelessness to the music and the great Academy Award winning song \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" is easily the greatest Disney song ever, to the point that it has become the offcial Disney theme.<br /><br />As a child I was as moved by PINOCCHIO as any film that I saw.  Jiminy Cricket was among all my favorite childhood movie characters, matched perhaps only by the Scarecrow in THE WIZARD OF OZ.  And two of the scariest moments of my childhood (scary in a good way) came from the film, the first being the horrific moment when Lampwick, after spouting ears and tail, turns back to look at Pinocchio with the face of a donkey.  The second was Monstro.  Everything about Monstro terrified me.  As a very small child I had seen a bit of the fairly mediocre movie version of MOBY DICK starring Gregory Peck as Ahab.  The image of Moby Dick destroying the ship at the end was branded into my memory and as a result all movies featuring large fish were for me the apex of horror, something brought home as an adult when I saw JAWS for the first time.  (I experienced a series of nightmares as a 4 or 5 year old of the shadow of Moby Dick haunting the walls of our house.)  For me, Monstro was Moby Dick on steroids.<br /><br />Personally, I think the changes made in the Pinocchio story were both warranted and desirable.  If you have read the Collodi stories, Pinocchio is a completely unlikable brat.  As they point out in the \\"making of\\" documentary, the original stories were serialized and were essentially a string of tales of the trouble Pinocchio would get himself into.  As a reader, much of the enjoyment you are supposed to derive (though I have to confess I did not) is from seeing the messes he got himself into through his wrongdoing and foibles.  In the Disney version, the title character is made a tad less central to the story, made much sweeter and more likable, and the cricket is elevated to a vastly more important role, to the point where he becomes the film's main character.  The result is that we actually care about what happens in the film to Pinocchio, whereas in Collodi's stories we pretty much feel that Pinocchio deserves any grief that comes his way.<br /><br />One of the featured reviews criticizes this release for tampering with the color palette.  If true (and I've no reason to doubt his statement to this effect) this is disturbing.  But even if true, does this in any way impede one's enjoyment of the film?  I have to be honest and say that it does not.  The film looks so bright and vibrant on an Up-Conversion DVD player (I have the DVD version, not the Blu-ray) that I was enchanted every second.  On a psychological level it is mildy bothersome to know that the palette has apparently been changed, but on an experential level it makes no difference.  Unless one has a spectacularly gifted eye (as a professional animator presumably has) one will certainly not notice differences in colors.  This version looked better to me than any I'd seen in the past, though I will confess that the most recent previous version I saw was the reissued VHS tape from the early nineties.  The experience of seeing this version is not in any way to be compared, say, to the colorized versions of classic Hollywood films from the thirties or forties that were originally made in black and white.  Those to me were always monstrosities, since they were intended to be seen in shades of gray.<br /><br />Issues of palette aside, I've been extremely impressed with the last several Disney reissues of classic films.  The feature films themselves have been a delight, but I've gotten just as much enjoyment from the many special features that have been added.  The bonus features try to be all things to all potential viewers, with games for small children that I simply skip, but also a number of documentary and archival features that adults will love but that kids will want to miss.  If you have read any books on the Disney studios (such as Neal Gabler's recent exceptionally fine biography WALT DISNEY), it is a delight to see behind the scenes footage of all the legendary Disney animators and artists.  The commentary, which includes film critic Leonard Maltin, who has made no secret of how much he is a fan of the Disney studio products, is both informative and entertaining.<br /><br />It is easy to overlook just how influential this film has been.  Compared to SNOW WHITE and BAMBI, it has had a far greater impact on the larger culture.  Most people know of Pinocchio not through Collodi's stories, but through the Disney film.  And in the larger culture Pinocchio figures in countless stories and characters.  For instance, novelist Robert Coover wrote PINOCCHIO IN VENICE, in which he goes to Venice as an old man (btw, a thoroughly unlikable novel).  In STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, the android Data is based explicitly on Pinocchio, both in that he is supposed to bear some resemblence to him and in that he aspires to be truly human.  The Steven Spielberg film A.I., based on the Brian Aldiss short story \\"Super-toys Last All Summer Long,\\" is a retelling of the Pinocchio story.  In Bill Willingham's absolutely brilliant FABLES series of comics, Pinocchio features as a major character (though one who is bitter that while he was made a real boy, he was made a perpetually preadolescent one).  Not only that, but Willingham uses Gepetto in a fascinating and unexpected way.  (FABLES, by the way, is currently being developed as a series for ABC.  The pilot is being filmed in New Zealand and hopefully will be taken to series.)  There are countless other uses to which the story has been put to use, so that Pinocchio is truly one of the constant features of our culture.  And the main means of spreading that story has been for nearly seventy years this great Disney film.<br /><br />Finally, while I have the two-disc DVD version of the film, I would strongly recommend that anyone interested in the film get the version that contains both the DVD and the Blu-ray versions.  Not many studios are offering films in this kind of packaging, but it is a great bargain.  Even if you don't have a Blu-ray player now, it is probable that they will become more prevalent inthe future.  But whatever format, this is one of a handful of great animated films that anyone who loves movies should own.  I give it not only a strong recommendation, but a passionate one.isney studio products, is both informative and entertaining.    It is easy to overlook just how influential this film has been.

B001FBSMF8|4.0|Let me start out by saying that this is pretty much a slap in the face to longtime Chris Cornell fans who've been listening to him since Soundgarden.  Obviously, those expecting a rock album will be disappointed beyond anything they can imagine.    Good.  Now that that's out of the way, let me just say that Scream is a fantastic record.  It's Timbaland at his most classic mixed with Cornell's unique vocals.  But it's not just a half-hearted attempt at making music...everything is done right to make this a groovy, danceable pop album.  The production is top-notch!  All the songs are joined together to create a seamless experience.  For those wanting a comparison, it's like a simpler version of Justin Timberlake's Futuresex/Lovesounds album.  Those who like this kind of music will love Scream.    Granted, it's a surprising move for Cornell, but he pulls it off wonderfully even if he did alienate some fans.  I'm very curious to know where he'll go from here...
6304884419|5.0|This movie is a wonderful triangle between three characters -- a boy and the two men he looks up to: his father, Lorenzo (Robert De Niro), and Sonny (Chazz Palminteri), the local mafia boss.  Both men love C and advise him, with completely different points of view. It is the two men who fight to be the dominating force in C's life.    It's 1960.  Nine year old Calogero LOVES the Yankees.  He likes to hang out with his friends -- all boys from the Italian neighborhood of the Bronx.  His father Lorenzo is a busdriver, his mother a homemaker.  Just yards away is the club that is owned by Sonny, the area's high-ranked mafia underboss.  Sonny and \\"his boys\\" are the local heroes ...  to everybody but Lorenzo.      One day, Calogero is sitting on the front stoop to his apartment building and he witnesses a shooting.  He not only sees the entire event unfold, but sees -- and locks eyes with -- the man holding the gun, none other than Sonny.  When Calogero is summoned by the police to face a line-up of suspects, Lorenzo is fearful ...  he knows what could happen if his son names the shooter.  Forced by the police, Lorenzo brings his son downstairs to stand in front of the suspects, who happen to be mobsters.  Calogero stands in front of each man and shakes his head.  Finally, he is brought in front of Sonny, and the stare at each other again.  Calogero once again shakes his head, allowing all the men to be released.  \\"I did a good thing, right Dad? I didn't rat!\\" he tells his father.  \\"You did a good thing ... for a bad man,\\" his father replies, but admits to his son that he did the right thing.  Calogero's show of loyalty to Sonny immediately earns him great respect -- not only amongst the neighbors,  but also by the mobsters.  Right away, one of Sonny's men contacts Lorenzo and presents him with a job offer on the side.  Lorenzo politely -- but succinctly -- declines.  He wants no part of the mob.    Sonny summons Calogero to him and the two talk.  When Calogero expresseshis anger over the latest Yankees game (where they lost), Sonny's reply to that is, \\"Forget them, forget Mickey Mantle! He doesn't care about you -- why should you care about him?\\"  Calogero asks Sonny why he shot the man and Sonny replies, \\"You'll understand when you get older.\\"  Calogero begins to sneak away from home and visit Sonny in the club, where he learns how to serve drinks (making large tips in the process) and how to throw dice.  As he and Sonny grow closer, Sonny presents him with a new name -- \\"C.\\"  C learns quickly that being in Sonny's circle has a lot of perks and earns him special treatment from many of the local vendors.      When Lorenzo discovers his son's cash ($600), he angrily goes to Sonny's club, with C in tow, to return the money.  Sonny and Lorenzo nearly come to blows and Lorenzo angrily yells, \\"He's not your son, he's mine!\\" C is angry with his father and yells at him, \\"People love Sonny, just like people love you on the bus!\\" Lorenzo tells his son, \\"They don't love him, they fear him!\\"     Sonny becomes C's mentor as the boy grows into a teenager.  Sonny shows a firm hand when something could negatively affect C, scaring off a local punk trying to sell C's gang of friends illegal guns.  C looks up to Sonny even more as the movie goes on, envying the fancy cars and the high respect the mafia boss receives wherever he goes.  When Sonny invites C to a boxing match, C has to decline -- he already promised his father he would go with him.  C watches from high up as Sonny is sitting ringside, wishing he was sitting with Sonny instead.      \\"Is it better to be loved or feared?\\" C asks Sonny. Sonny's reply is direct: feared.  \\"Fear lasts longer than love.\\"  C develops feelings for a black girl and expresses this to Sonny, who is laid back about it.  Sonny tells C that it doesn't matter and explains how to immediately see if the girl is a \\"good one.\\"  Then Sonny offers C his sports car for the date.  Lorenzo's feelings on an Italian-Black relationship is the opposite of Sonny's: he doesn't want his son dating a non-Italian.  Both men have completely different views on life and  what is important.  In the end, C comes of age having seen the views of both men and appreciating them both in different ways.    Chazz Palminteri does a splendid job as Sonny, who is by no means innocent but nonetheless loves C as his own son.  He makes it a point to show that Sonny has not gone soft, despite his closeness to C ... and in a moment of great conflict, shows that he can turn on anybody in a second.  And Robert DeNiro (also the director) performs well as Lorenzo, who struggles against a mobster for the love and respect of his own son.  Both actors who play C, Francis Capra and Lillo Brancato, do well ... though it is the younger C that makes C most believable.  Also in this is Joe Pesci, who makes a brief appearance in the very beginning  and finally speaks at the end.
B001GKJ2FW|2.0|Well, I'd heard of this since the stage musical came out and was instantly intrigued.  Sadly, I never got to see the musical, so I was really glad when they made a movie.  What a travesty it is!    The only redeeming value of this movie is the cast.  They were certainly having fun while making this film.  Christine Baranski, Julie Walters and Meryl Streep were wonderful.  The movie suffers in direction and, sadly, the music itself.  The film plays out like it should be on stage, when some of the performance should've been tailored to fit a movie.  The sets were cheesy and fake-looking.  And the music...it's an affront to ABBA.  All the fun of ABBA's music has been sucked out of these performances.  While everyone's acting was good, the singing voices of Julie Walters and Pierce Brosnan were terrible.  \\"Dancing Queen\\" sounds like bad, off-key karaoke.  \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" almost made my ears bleed and was the one moment where Streep sounded bad.    All in all, this movie was a waste of time.  And I love musicals...from Meet Me In St. Louis and Sound of Music, through Rocky Horror Picture Show, down to Chicago and Moulin Rouge.    I realize this film is the most successful film musical of all time, and I can appreciate that lots of people loved it.  It just wasn't my cup of tea.
075640407X|5.0|Well, after 450 reviews and the general overwhelming praise this book has received on this site, and critically, I still feel compelled to chime in.  Fantasy is not generally my first choice when grabbing a book to read; however, in this instance I found myself drawn to this book.  Of course, once I started reading I could not keep away.  An exceptionally enjoyable book, first time author Patrick Rothfuss introduces compelling characters, mystery, intrigue, romance, and some good natures humor all wrapped in a vivid and sometimes mystical setting.  The first of a trilogy, this incredible read left me wanting to find out what comes next.  Often, I have heard books described as being musical in nature,  This excellent novel features music and a true love of books themselves.  I can't recommend this enough.  As an avid reader of a variety of books and genres, this book is one of the best I have read in years.  Enjoy.<br /><br />And now, the wait begins to sidle up to a table at the Wayside Inn and listen to Kvothe tell the rest of his story...
B001MYIXAC|1.0|Saw this movie in the theater, thought it was the most wonderful movie I'd seen all year. Couldn't wait to purchase it. Saw it went on sale, purchased it, received it, popped it in the DVD player, and noticed that the subtitles were drastically different. This link provides a good comparison between the original wonderful translation and the piece of garbage that it was replaced with:    [...]
B0013FSL3E|4.0|My kids just loved the movie! my daughter took it with her everywhere. She watched it at home, in her room, even in the car. She's seen it at least twenty times.
B0002JP4L4|4.0|I saw this in the movies when it first came out, but I was amazed how many of the songs in the show are now 'standards'.  We recently saw the road show in Ft. Lauderdale and it inspired us to buy the DVD. (The movie's better!!)
B001P3SA94|1.0|I can't say that I'm surprised to see such a lame hollywoodized version of what could have been a powerful film. The individual stories of some of the people in the film, Muddy Waters, Leonard Chess(and his brother), and Howling Wolf in particular, deserve their own movie. They deserve something on the scale of \\"Ray\\", not a slapped together, cable TV film. I hoped for a decent film anyway, but the people who made this film just didn't respect the artists or their music enough.      This film might have gotten away with poor writing, mediocre acting, and lazy directing, if it had gotten one thing right: the music. All of the remakes of blues classics in this film would hardly hold up at an open mike night at any average blues club in America. There was no way any of these actors were going to come close.They should have just used the originals. Beyonce's arrogance, in particular, is galling. You just need to listen to the first two words of Etta James's \\"At Last\\", compared to Beyonce's, to know that Beyonce is way out of her league on this one. All the technical singing prowess in the world is not going to make up for pure tone and true feeling, especially with The Blues. Beyonce presents a convincing argument for why American Idol should never have a Blues week.     The shame of this movie is that it is filled with good actors, wasting their talent. By all accounts, the people in the film were either highly charismatic or very intense, or both. That doesn't come across at all through these performances. Eamonn Walker does manage a passable Howling Wolf, in spite of the screenplay. Jeffrey Wright reduces Muddy Waters to a supporting character who gets too many lines, and Adrien Brody is clearly thinking about a paycheck and his next project after this stinker.
B00008973A|5.0|What more can I say?  The show is GREAT. We've seen it 3 or 4 times on stage and this is a terrific addition to your library so you can replay the excitement whenever you want!
B000683VI4|5.0|I love, Love, LOVE this movie. It is the best romantic movie from the past 10 years!
B001TODO54|3.0|I think this book is very well written and presents the dilemma of talent vs. agency very nicely. Just because we are gifted in a certain way, or have been dealt a specific situation in life, doesn't mean we accept it. It's the same dilemma presented in Harry Potter (It's not who we are, it's our choices that define us), in the Twilight series (vampires struggling to be good and overcoming their \\"carnal\\" natures), etc. The story itself is intriguing and captivating.    However, what I totally did not like was the decision that the main character, the heroine, makes against marriage and for \\"free love\\". This book is intended for young adults. Is this the message we want to send them? The heroine feels that marriage will \\"trap\\" her, but sex without commitment, without any sign of exclusivity, is somehow liberating. This is not an appropriate view for YA literature. Because of this one sub-theme, I'm not able to share this book with my younger teenagers, which is just a shame.
B001E7GPBQ|5.0|I love this collection of short stories!  Beautifully written \\"unfoldings\\" of peoples lives... you can't help but relate to and care about her characters.  What a talented writer!
B000VNMMR0|4.0|HELP PLEASE. The unrated edition includes the theatrical and the unrated version of the film. On the back it says it has a music video. I have checked both menus for both versions and i cant find anything. Is it a hidden feature? an easter egg?    Anyway, its great action, sometimes exagerated but thats part of the diehard history. The unrated version is better. Good thing i bought it when it was 10.99. Enjoy it.
B00005JOA0|5.0|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was first-rate in content, presentation, cast and the gorgeous scenery. The quality of the DVD was excellent and I am so proud to add it to my growing library of classics. I am completely besotted with the handsome and magnetic Toby Stephens and hope that others who have the power to cast him will do so with dispatch for his talent is stellar. Even after having read these wonderful books, to have them interpreted in such a glorious manner is enlightening and endearing. Gumbo82035@aol.com
1440469563|5.0|...It is a suggestion in the way that you read this book. I suggest attacking this piece of literary masterpiece in a three-pronged maneuver - through reading the book, listening to the audiobook and watching the film, as close to the same time as possible. I did it backwards and I wish I had staved off watching the film all the way through...<br /><br />I began my S&S journey by discovering characters through Mamma Mia, of all places. The groom in the movie, Dominic Cooper, was intriguing to me, so I looked him up and guess who he turned out being? None other than Mr. John Willoughby himself. From there I was hooked on the youtube.com 2007 BBC version and HAD to read the book because I just knew there were holes in the story!<br /><br />The first few chapters of the book were hard to get through, but I had Willoughby's smouldering eyes to keep me going. I read a few chapters, then listened to the chapters over again. I found the audiobook for free on iTunes, under a section by Southern Florida University called Lit2Go. It helped IMMENSELY that the reader had an English accent because the colloquialisms came right through and there were many \\"aha!\\" moments.<br /><br />When I finished both, I bought the DVD of S&S (BBC version) and I will be purchasing/renting the Kate Winslet version soon. So with $[...], you too, can discover this amazing piece of literature through exploring the visual (film), the audio (audiobook) and the actual book. Enjoy!
B001H5X7I4|4.0|this film is made by hollywood for hollywood, but for the east coasters it is still a good watch. it is silly, it is constant, and it is well made.<br /><br />it is a little gross at times, through.<br /><br />but the performances make me smile. the men obviously had fun making this film, and i had fun watching it.
B001CWOCV8|1.0|I think it has a serious recording problem. My player is a Denon 3800BDCI and the BD just plays the trailer and then it stop... Well, I was refunded by Amazon but I lost money...
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love The Big Bang so I had to love the DVD.  Unfortunately special features are near non-existant.  Pretty much just the shows.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I watched this video for free and shared the link with my husband, who shared it with our children (ages 18,14,12). He shared it with friends, and they shared it with friends. We all loved it so much we had to buy the DVD.     We loved the concept, the comic book feel, the music was funny and well done. We loved the singing credits that's only available on the DVD.     This model of putting the work out there for free and, if people appriciate it, they will purchase it worked for us. Now we can watch it on \\"the big screen\\".
B001FB4W02|5.0|Before I get to my review, let me give the run-down of what this DVD set has to offer, according to KryptonSite. The Blu-Ray version may differ.    For starters, the current release date is August 25, 2009.    It'll include all 22 episodes from Smallville's eighth season, as well as the following features: cast & creator commentaries (including Geoff Johns for \\"Legion\\"), unaired scenes, a featurette titled \\"Smallville's Doomsday: The Making of a Monster,\\" and another featurette called \\"In the Director's Chair: Behind the Scenes and Calling the Shots with Allison Mack.\\"    Awesome features for an awesome season.    Now, on to my review...    I've been a fan of the show since day one, but I wasn't expecting much from Season 8.    This time around, Lex and Lana aren't recurring characters. Also, the original producers didn't return. To say the least, I was fearful.    To my pleasant surprise, however, Smallville's eighth season has become my favorite yet. It's darker. It's edgier. Finally, Clark is making the transition from farmboy to superhero.    Don't get me wrong. This season has its missteps, like any other in Smallville's history. But I'd say that, overall, this has been the most entertaining season yet. Here's why...    - Clark is more heroic than ever  - Chloe gets some spotlight for a change  - The Lois and Clark relationship begins to blossom  - Some loose ends are tied (Lex, Lana, Kara)  - More input from the Justice League  - The introduction of Tess Mercer, a worthy replacement for Lex  - Sam Witwer as Doomsday    And let me repeat that. Sam Witwer as Doomsday.    He successfully turns a 2D character with no personality into one of the most intriguing, exciting parts of Smallville history. I think I enjoyed his performances more than any others this season.    Let those Season 7 wounds heal.    Enjoy Season 8 of Smallville.
1742140610|4.0|This book was narrated by Edwina Wren, an Australian actress who did an excellent job in my opinion of voicing a book about contemporary \\"young adults\\".  I may not have been so enchanted by the book if I had not heard it read by Ms Wren, but having done so, I highly recommend it to urban fantasy fans as a fun listen.<br /><br />There was something comforting about the fact that 16 year old behavior hasn't changed much since the late 60's-early 70's.  Oral gratification in terms of drinking, smoking and *ahem* \\"other things\\" are still issues.  The protagonist does come across as a bit sanctimonious, but one of the writers is a mom!  She has to write mom things.  If the person who is checking this book out is worried about whether the intended reader is ready for this-- well, it's mentioned but not graphically displayed, and it's not approved of by the protagonist.<br /><br />The only thing that I felt a bit squeamish about?  The big dollop of Mary Sue.  Not only is the heroine a fledgling vampire, but she is also a special fledgling, with special powers, and a special vampire mark.  If it weren't for the wry humor, this would have become irritating in short order.

1416914307|2.0|The books are all the same they don't bring anything different ! I don't think any of the characters are special and I didn't have a connection to any of them. I tried really hard with this book but no it didn't happen for me. The story is creepy and well that's not my thing.  Breaking Dawn might have been disappointing to some people but at least you get caught up in that world.   I hope everyone else liked it but I'm no fan !
044024367X|1.0|This will be my last Lee Child novel. It is mundane and boring in  the beginning but then , just for added torture,  slowly and painfully delves  into his political views- Lee Child's, not anything I  would believe of Reacher.It is as though he took the Reacher we had come to love and substituted him with a dullard professor from Berkely  Why do novelists think we give a rats butt about their politics? I want a Reacher story, not a Mr. Child manifesto on his anti American, anti war views. He has taken a great series and ruined it for a lot of us. I have canceled my order for #13.
0316010669|4.0|Blink is about quick decisions that we all make without deep analysis. Often the decision makers cannot explain the rationale and logic behind these decisions. There are three themes that I picked up from the book. First, \\"blink\\" decisions may be better than decisions that are made after analysis and thought therefore we should not dismiss them. Second, there are other times that \\"blink\\" decisions can be terrible. Third, how do we improve our \\"blink\\" decisions? How can we distinguish situations that \\"blinks\\" are help or hurt us? The book is not organized quite this way . I found the author's writing and stories very enjoyable, but  I did not follow what his point was  in numerous parts. The stories were loosely related to \\"blinking\\". Some were too forced.  Gladwell certainly gives you a lot to think about but does not really build a model that applies to the real world.    Blink is delightful and very entertaining. Like the other two Gladwell books, the writing is excellent. The author creates the appropriate level of suspense in his numerous stories. He is a master at luring readers into his world. I think that he has improved with each subsequent book. Outliers was the best then Blink then Tipping Point.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Although I've been a fan of Mr. Anderson's films since Boogie Nights, \\"There Will Be Blood\\"  is something totally different. It's definitely not a family/fluff film and the seekers of Hollywood-style happy endings should look elsewhere. This is a story about a man who possesses nothing but greed and hatred. A very dark tale about a very dark side of us humans; so dark, it at times makes you think you're watching a Bergman film . Cinematography is superb, acting is top notch and above all the pacing of the story (one of the most illusive aspects of film making) is brilliant.   Though there are a couple of pot holes in the script, I rate this film a very strong 5 stars and recommend it to those who expect nothing short of a profound and spiritual experience.
0486440966|5.0|This 1860 novel is a fabulous yarn of madness, identity theft, spousal abuse, ghostly apparitions, invalids, secret societies, proto-feminists, and hypnotic charisma.  It is eminently readable.  The characters are memorable, particularly the spirited Marion Halcombe, whose intelligence and pluck enable her not only to see through others' subterfuges, but also to thwart a good many of them, and Count Fosco, who is both repulsive in his obesity and arrogance and irresistibly compelling in his sheer physical presence and voice.  Frederick Fairlie, the invalid uncle, and Mrs. Catherick, the evil mommy dearest, are also strongly drawn minor characters.  The only two who are nearly ciphers are Laura Fairlie and Walter Hartright, the novel's two young lovers at the center of the plot.  Boring.  They pale in comparison to the more vividly drawn supporting players.  I find it notable that the two most intelligent and interesting characters, Marion and Fosco, are also described as, at least in part, physically unappealing: Marion is lithe of figure and regal of bearing, but \\"ugly\\" (Collins's word) of face; Fosco is leviathan in girth and appetite.  Nevertheless, Collins (and readers, too--at least this one) are drawn to their charismatic personalities.    The plot is convoluted, but it all hangs together in the end.  The narrative style of stringing together statements and journal entries written by various characters to offer their perspective on events works very well.  Collins does a good job most of the time distinguishing between the characters' voices.  The one question left unanswered for me was, how did Sir Percival Glyde learn of and decide to victimize Laura Fairlie in the first place?  Perhaps I was not a careful enough reader.  Despite this lingering question, I enjoyed the book very much and highly recommend it to fans of gothic fiction and sensation novels.
630179849X|5.0|I ordered this for a Christmas gift to a John Wayne lover. I was exactly what I wanted and in great shape. This is a good movie and we really enjoy it. Shipping was pretty quick considering it to be a holiday. Good buy!
032147404X|4.0|I'm new in this world of photography so i don't know much of it. But what i like of this book is you can take it wherever you go to take pictures because it talks about almost every kind of shots with easy indications and advices. I've seen other books with too specifics explanations that you read but cannot take them with you.
1604590483|1.0|Here is the summary of this book; religious faith is at the heart of our subconscious and prayer is the way to wealth. Okay, I just hate it when people use faith as a tool to get material wealth in this world. It's just hypocrisy of it that disgusts me. Don't get this book if you're looking for a scientific and empirical method to empower your subconscious. This is a religious propaganda wrapped up in the cover of psychology. It quotes the New testament throughout the book trying to convert you to his faith. I'm not an atheists but I hate to get tricked in to buying a book that's supposed to be about empowering your mind then turns out to be some religious propaganda trying desperately preaching the power of religious faith. He site no evidence for his claims and the miracles that supposed to have happened. There is no scientific evidence for any of this. This book is a JOKE!

0316017922|4.0|Though I found the author's previous two books so so, I couldnt help myself to jump into his third bestseller. To my surprise, I found it both entertaining and useful. Perhaps I am such a pragmatic guy that I always want to read something applicable and the \\"10,000 hour rule\\" per success of Beatles, Bill Gates and Mozart did help to motivate me to work harder, despite the luck factor/priviledge factor mentioned. On the other hand, the concepts of Matthew Effect re juvenile/pre pro sports and cultural factors re Korean airline crashes were interesting as well. In short, a very good read with insights. Recommended!
B000N0W9WO|5.0|A great romantic film for a holiday, or for any season. Nearly perfectly cast, acted with vigor. The movie that made me decide Cameron Diaz is worth watching after all. (And to be fair to her, I have since also enjoyed \\"In Her Shoes\\" and \\"Being John Malkovich.\\") Jude Law and Jack Black are both fun to watch, and Kate Winslet is, well, Kate Winslet - a woman with a genuine gift. The film seems to get a little fuzzy on its timeline in the middle for a bit, bit is otherwise just a heap of fun. Not too deep, not too schmaltzy. A chick flick for guys.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is absolutely awesome. The restoration of all 3 is incredible to view. I will watch over and over again.
B00007GZR5|5.0|My wife and I love this film. For me, it is one of the few films I've seen that improves on its literary source (which I also enjoyed) -- the story is considerably tighter, the dramatic tension higher. Williams, Gooding, and Sciorra are uniformly excellent; in fact, this is probably our favorite Robin Williams performance, and that's saying something. Very, very good special effects for the time.    Death, and life after death, are tough subjects, and most people shy away from them, outside the horror or tragedy genres. This film (and its source novel) tackles contemporary afterlife research head on, and provide a moving, emotionally charged experience for those who are open to it.
B00139W3NE|4.0|Natalie Portman is alittle darker in this film.  She has so many great performances. Dakota Blue Richards will go far in the business and she makes a great heroine in this film. Fast action, fast pace but you can follow the story line.

0439023483|5.0|I read this book several months ago from the library and was hooked. I had to get my own copy and kept checking for the next book in the series. I found it on Amazon and pre-ordered it so I can have it as soon as it comes out.   Katniss Everdeen is a truly believable character. She is a teenager with a head on her. She is forced to support her mother and little sister when her father is killed in a mine explosion. This prepares her for her fight to the death in the Hunger Games, but not for Peeta's profession of love.   The story pulls you in and you cannot put the book down. Then at the end it is just beginning and you groan to yourself since you will have to wait until the next book to find out what happens between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. Will Prim still be in the lottery for the next Hunger Games since she is only twelve? How will Katniss keep her safe?   Totally and completely a good read.
B001PPF12Q|5.0|This release is great but buyer beware. It's not remastered and most of the extra tracks; which are excellent are on the Airbag \\"How's My Driving\\" EP. If you do not own those; or the My Iron Lung EP in regards to the The Bends Collector's Edition then I highly recommend these releases.    However if you have the singles or EPs from the respective albums you won't find much new material here unfortunately.    Still I'm glad this will be available for the newer generation of Radiohead fans to enjoy. Songs like \\"Pearly\\", \\"A Reminder\\" and \\"Meeting in the Isle\\" are must haves for any Radiohead fan.
B0018CWESK|1.0|Crock o'poo and a snoozefest to boot.<br /><br />Van Helsing is aimed squarely at socially awkward 14 year-old-boys stupider than the esthetics of the trench coat mafia crowd. I should have suspected something when the \\"two disc collector's edition\\" was on sale in the four-dollar cut-out bin.<br /><br />The good things: the visuals and the dramatic camera angles and sweeps make this a visually interesting film, but sadly no better than its comic book origins. Hugh Jackman gives a credible performance distinct enough from Wolverine to safely cash his check in good conscience.<br /><br />Just awful: Kate Beckinsale is hobbled by the wardrobe director, who forces her to wear an outfit that makes you think she is in a topless teddy (she isn't, there is a scrim of cloth that is *exactly*the*same*color*as*her*skin*tone* and the only difference is some tiny red thread embroidery. The obvious attempt at inspiring allegiance from the audience sub-set of breast fetishists got annoying after a while, and sadly director Stephen Sommers plays it up, as nearly every action shot of Beckinsale leaves the somnolent viewer wondering \\"did her knockers just fall out?\\" Ooopss, no, it is just that silly outfit again.\\"<br /><br />This is a real kitchen sink of a character mix. Let's throw in every monster we can shall we? Werewolves, brides of Frankenstein's monster, Frankenstein's monster, a grotesque and scared Igor, brides of Dracula, flying goblin progeny of Dracula and....DRACULA HIMSELF!!!!<br /><br />Most.Boring.Dracula.Ever.<br /><br />Yep, he beats out \\"Dracula in Pakistan.\\"<br /><br />Really, in college I lit f-rts that were scarier than this guy.

And this guy is less scary than that.<br /><br />Even the brides of Dracula aren't that sexy, sporting pancake make-up so thick I was wondering where the maple syrup and side of bacon was.<br /><br />Van Helsing shoulders a miniature Tommy gun crossbow that shoots silver stakes. He shoots these from cylindrical magazines that hold hundreds of rounds. When actors hold the silver stakes they look like oversized tent pegs half a meter long. Van Helsing whips this weapon around with the ease of a water pistol. Given that silver weighs 11 grams per cubic centimeter, each stake weighs seven kilograms and Van Helsing could obviously rip a bank vault in two, yet puny flying bats also knock him over. Must be some off-screen Superman-Kryptonite kind of thing.<br /><br />Plot consists of Van Helsing shooting things with occasional interruptions as a supporting character stumbles upon a (document, wall, mosaic, old book, scroll, secret formula, new potion) that helps him shoot things better. The things when hit melt into jelly-skeletons and scream as they re-enter Hell. Putting your ear next to a band saw and slicing a finger off gives you the approximate sonic effect.<br /><br />What is amazing is how jaw-droppingly expensive the practical sets are and how detailed the CGI is. This was a very expensive film and I'll bet it will never make back its money.<br /><br />Here is my review of the Bonus Disc: I was sooooooo bored with the original movie I could not be bothered to look at it and instead used it as scarecrow flasher to keep birds out of my cherry tree.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|All I can say is this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Angelina Jolie did a magnificent job!
1401219268|5.0|I love this book.  I read it just a week before the movie came out and was thoroughly enthralled in the storyline and complexity of each character.  Without exception, Watchmen is the best graphic novel I've ever read.  The illustrations are great and it's a very easy book to get into.  As the story jumps from one character to the next and flashes back several decades, you'll find yourself really entwined in each character's moral dilemma, each of who react very differently in each situation, and what's better, you'll get to understand why the characters have become what they are and why they do what they do.<br /><br />My favorite character is Rorschach!  Goddamn, he's awesome.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|I've been a fan of Chris Cornell for 20 years, from the first time I heard Soundgarden. They were opening for Danzig in a small theater in Dallas called the Arcadia somewhere around the fall of 1989 or so. I heard that voice, and knew it would stick with me forever. Through the years, I've supported everything Chris Cornell has done, gone to all the live shows, and thoroughly enjoyed each project. \\"Scream\\", however, is an embarrassing piece of trash. Is he serious about this? I feel like he's looking at all of his longtime fans, and giving us all the finger. It's downright awful. There are no redeeming qualities about it. When I listened to it, I was sick to my stomach. I don't know what he was thinking. I won't be seeing him on this tour. I hope he redeems himself soon. I'm waiting to find out that this is some kind of joke, kinda like the Joaquin Phoenix thing. I'm remaining hopeful that the real Chris Cornell will come back to us someday.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|I have no idea why people hate this movie?  The story follow pretty close to the one in Casino Royale and the action is off the hook.  I almost didn't get it based on what people said then I realized the general public belongs in a zoo, so I got this movie and LOVE IT!!!!!!!  If you're a Jim Bond fan, this is the movie for you.  If you don't like it, don't buy it!
B00001ODGR|5.0|This was a pretty darn good dvd.  I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was.  Well done lads.  Well done.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Return to Oz features a young Fairuza Balk (The Craft, American History X) as Dorothy Gale who returns to Oz (hence the title) to find the Emerald City in ruins and all of her old friends turned to stone. This sequel has a completely different tone than the 1939 Wizard of Oz movie. This lacks musical numbers and is very dark, completely unlike the upbeat and colorful world in the earlier Oz. It is more in tune with the Oz books.    It's a shame that this movie was not a success and ended up being the only film directed by Walter Murch (who is still succesfully working in the film biz in many other capacities) because he seemed like a good solid filmmaker with a nice sense of style. Some of these scenes are just filmed so creepily, like the ones featuring the wheelers and Mombi. I first saw this movie a few years after it came out when I was about 4 or 5 years old and I still find many of these scenes to be incredibly haunting. There's also some really cool claymation effects in here by Will Vinton, the guy who animated the California Raisins and the movie The Adventures of Mark Twain (which contained The Mysterious Stranger, which has become a popular Youtube clip).     Actually, just about everything in this movie seems really well done to me. I especially like the sets in this. I think the 80s were probably when sets in fantasy movies looked their best (other examples include Labyrinth and The Neverending Story). I think this is partly because movies in general started to look nicer and also because the idea of movies with big budgets/big returns was popular at this time so fantasy movies started to get a bigger financial backing. You haven't seen movies that look like this since because for whatever reason, fantasy movies quit being popular in the 90s and now that they're popular again, the technology has advanced so much that you end up with movies like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. These movies use so many effects and so much digital trickery to create their sets that nothing even looks real in them (which doesn't make them bad movies. It's just kind of a bummer). The costumes, cinematography, and score are also sick as hell.    Anyway, I guess I'm kind of rambling here, but what I'm trying to say is this: They don't make 'em like this anymore and I wish they still did.
0060736267|5.0|This book, written in 1943, is so heartwarming. It looks at family relationships in a very unique way. A must read.
B001LMU182|4.0|Perfect transfer, wish i had seen it in cinema but this the closest it gets. I have an average av receiver and the sound is just incredible, what can i say, awesome picture quality for such an old movie and ubsolutely unreal sound. Recommended to every fan of animated movies on blu-ray. Oh, and there are no extras, very sad...
B00000F14B|5.0|There are already many reviews for this product, and I won't bore you by repeating much of it.<br /><br />Mr. Preston seems born into this role.  Ron Howard was so cute singing \\"Gary, Indiana.\\"  The movie harks back to a time when entertainment was frequently high quality and innocence was the norm rather than the rare exception.<br /><br />Mostly I would say I love having this DVD because I liked watching the musical on TV back in the \\"3 channel\\" days.  Unlike some classics made DVD, this one not only survives the transition, but THRIVES.  I love having it on the bigscreen in widescreen format and Dolby 5.1 Digital.<br /><br />Whether or not you are familiar with it, if you love the musicals from the era when they were popular, then this movie is a must-see!<br /><br />If you are not familiar with such musicals, it is still worth seeing.  It is 181 minutes of fun!<br /><br />I think that MOST everyone except the die-hard action-addicts will like this movie.  Such action-addicts would be better served watching the latest \\"Fast & Furious\\" knock-off.  To almost everyone else I can unreservedly recommend this movie.
B0020EK4QY|4.0|This is a great film, and it will be even better on Blu-Ray. I am excited that this is finally being released on Blu-Ray in the US.    Harrison Ford turns in a great role as the President.    The TrueHD Audio should sound awesome - especially the action scenes.  I highly recommend.    EDIT: I have now seen this movie and it is AWESOME! The video and audio are superb.
B001N3OCV6|4.0|While many of the pieces here are well chosen, there are a few musical choices that didn't mesh as well as the others. Some stand out brilliantly such as \\"The Times They Are A'changin\\" & \\"Pruit Igoe & Prophecies\\", but others such as \\"Demolition Row\\" & \\"Hallelujah\\" just stick out like sore thumbs.<br /><br />To some, the collection of songs may seem disjointed & be angry that certain pieces from the film were left out. HOWEVER, most of the songs were directly referenced in the comic chapter titles (such as \\"All Along the Watchtower\\") & others were in the comic but not used in the movie, such as \\"You're My Thrill\\".  While it doesn't make for the most linear listening experience, the album is pretty complete for the most part.<br /><br />That brings me to the ones that just didn't do it for me. \\"Hallelujah\\" is one of them, with the song just sounding incredibly ridiculous & not really that much fun to listen to. The other one is a song that I like, but didn't really fit with the rest of the soundtrack: \\"Desolation Row\\". MCR are sell-outs, but they are entertaining ones. The only problem is that their remake lacks the soul of the original Bob Dylan song & seems to be the obligatory rock remake that every \\"oldies\\" soundtrack seems to have tacked onto it. Perhaps the original would have been better added, or another song would have been better to remake.<br /><br />Overall this soundtrack isn't bad. I'm hoping that the rumors of a director's cut will be true, which means that some of the unused soundtrack tracks (including the ones on the orchestral soundtrack) will be present if the cut scenes are included on the director's cut dvd.
0525951113|5.0|The book starts out as an intelligent techno-thriller, but it morphs into something more. Hidden within the action is some gentle commentary on 21st Century society.  The author hints at a dystopian future that is uncomfortably believable.     The book appears to be well-researched, but since some of the technology is unfamiliar, it's hard for a layman to say.  You will not regret reading this book, although it may leave you with a feeling of uneasiness about the future.
031606792X|5.0|I loved reading all the books in the \\"Twilight Saga\\" and I have to say by far this is the best! I would defiantly recommend this series of books to anyone! \\"Breaking Dawn\\" was captivating and full of excitement, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. I have hardly been able to put it down! It is for sure a MUST read!
B001R4MEYI|5.0|This album by mastodon is damn near perfection and I think that any metal fan out there should get this. Yes the screaming vocals are gone but now you get to really hear them shine. I like that everyone in the band can sing because they do on this album and it's really good. My favourite track is the 10 minute epic track \\"the czar\\" I recommend this cd to everyone because it's so well down and Mastodon are really beginning to pull away from all those other metal bands (which is a good thing).... Also how often does rolling stone magazine give a metal album 4 out 5 stars, or anyone who isn't the beatles or Bruce Springsteen?
B000QUCNP4|4.0|ZODIAC    This movie is actually a very interesting and entertaining look at a coward named [self named] The Zodiac Killer. For those who have read my other review [The Zodiac Killer-which was a good movie over all] about this fame seeking individual will know what I think of this chump. This seemed like a real event to me when I was watching it [as in the movie felt real, I know the events actually took place] since the atmosphere, writing, direction, and acting seemed to be in top order. For fans of serial killer movies and movie fans over all this is worth while flick that is purchase worthy in my opinion. Of course I am sure you all know what it is basically about, the killer right? Kinda    While the movie is basically about this guy the true story lies within the people who covered the killings and the ones who investigated them. And even then it is not truly about those people it is about how it affected their lives and changed them. You may be saying well that means it is about them then, no because how it affected them is basically how it affected the whole area. This movie is about the impact this glory hound had on the population during this time, the book on which this is based is great by the way.    Any way the film follows a couple of different people from the lead investigators to other police officers from different areas, and of course the newspaper employees who followed this case as well. It was interesting to see these people go through changes that altered their lives forever; some just gave up while stayed obsessed with the case. Director David Fincher who you may know from making other great films like \\"Seven and Fight Club\\" I believe does a great job with this movie. Although you will say to yourself at one point or another \\"this is a long movie\\" it still is a great viewing experience. James Vanderbilt's screenplay based on Robert Graysmith's book is wonderful and really brings the people on screen to life.    Speaking of author Robert Graysmith he is played wonderfully by Jake Gyllenhaal whose obsession with the case drives him closer and closer to an answer he will never truly get. Maybe one day but as far as the book and film even though he believes he knows who the Zodiac is he will never truly get the answer as of now. Jake is great n this film and you can see the transformation of an everyday average guy to a man who becomes so obsessed that he alienates his own family. Mark Ruffalo is great as well playing Inspector David Toschi as is Anthony Edwards who plays Inspector William Armstrong. Both do great jobs in this film and are truly upset that they never caught their man.    One of my favorite actors out there Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as usual playing Paul Avery. This guy goes from being one of the most confident people ever to being reduced to a shell of his former self, even though he ends up helping more then he thinks when Robert comes to see him. Another great performance comes in the form of John Carroll Lynch who plays the lead suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. Both these guys deliver well and add a lot to the film, glad both were cast in this. Still everyone that was in this movie deserves credit because all were good and deserve praise for their acting abilities.    This is a little more held back as far as blood and stuff compared to the filmmakers previous films but that adds to the atmosphere in my opinion. This is a wonderful movie that I truly believe most would enjoy even if it feels a bit long. The only problem is that if you want some special features you have to buy the two disc version, this single disc has nothing on it really. Still if it is all you can find the movie alone is worth it, go rent, buy or what ever this movie.
B000F9RB9Y|2.0|I think Sony or WHOEVER  released this alleged blu ray should be held liable for misrepresentation!! THIS DISC HAS NO BLU RAY QUALITIES, WHATSOEVER.

Boy, was I let down hard!  Matter of fact, the blu ray doesn't even have Spanish as an audio choice, while my other DVD DOES.  What gives?

0061139378|5.0|Bored in her new flat and forgotten by her parents, the young Coraline goes exploring and discovers a door that opens into another world, similar to her own but distinctly different. Back in her real world, her parents disppear--and so Coraline must be brave, grow up a little, a defeat the darkness of the world through the door. A fascinating, disturbing, somewhat gruesome, somewhat magical text, Coraline is a truly scary fairy tale in the vein of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. I love this book, both the text and the illustrations, and recommend it highly, especially to those who like Gaiman's style.<br /><br />I love children's literature in particular because children possess an unparalleled ability to accept what they see and read as real. Books like Coraline never doubt themselves or make excuses for the fantasy they contain, and the forthright honesty of their story are engaging and refreshing. Combined with Gaiman's touch--his ability to bring dark humor, complex alternate worlds, and simple creepiness into everything that he writes--and McKean's detailed yet otherworldy illustrations, Coraline creates a fantastical, dark, creepy world to life. The book is thrilling, scary, and engrossing all without feeling dumbed-down or apologetic.<br /><br />The book includes a definite moral element, but don't let that deter you from reading it. The majority of the focus is on Coraline's growth, not what she should be (according to some independent moral code) but rather the fact that she is becoming whoever it is that she will be--in this case a particular, brave, dry-humored child. That is to say, there is a moral, but the moral encourages general growth rather than specific growth, and so the book is empowering rather than irritating, even for the adult reader.<br /><br />Coraline is short, entertaining, creepy, weird, dark, empowering, and engrossing. I recommend it to all audience, and don't feel silly for picking up a children's book--this really is a wonderful read. It may not have the depth of a novel, but it's a book that I'm happy to have in my collection and come back to every now and then for a one-day read. I recommend that you check it out. It's one of Gaiman's best works.depth of a novel, but it's a book that I'm happy to have in my collection and come back to every now and then for a one-day read. I recommend that you check it out.

0380973839|5.0|Written as a number of short stories that build a coherent arc, The Martian Chronicles is the story of mankind's repeated attempts to colonize Mars. Before man, Mars is populated by a psychic race that is in some ways surprising similar to Earth's western civilizations, a suburban utopia of housewives, gardens, and jobs, but with more complex and ancient arts, histories, and literature. Earth's initially missions are all failures, but eventually the Martian race is wiped out and humans colonize the planet, destroying the old beauty that the Martians leave behind. When Earth begins to collapse in nuclear war, Mars is abandoned, left to a few stragglers and some new immigrants. The whole of the work is varied, and each chapter/short story is different: some expository, some humorous, some scientific, some bittersweet, some about Martians, some about humans. There is something haunting and memorable about the text, the last chapters specifically, and while The Martian Chronicles is not my favorite sci-fi work or even my favorite book about an alien race (that would be Asimov's The God's Themselves), it is classic Bradbury: surreal yet suburban, science-fiction but relevant, ironic, enjoyable, bittersweet, and all in all a good book. I recommend it.<br /><br />It is hard to discuss or summarize The Martian Chronicles because of the amount of variety from chapter to chapter in the text. Each chapter reads like an independent short story and could even stand alone. However, as a whole the text does build a definitive arc, creating a final product that is greater than the sum of its parts. As a result of this build up, the last chapters are definitely the best of the bunch--they are the ones that will stick with the reader and carry the most impact. They are also the most depressing, surreal, and haunting of the bunch--haunting is a world that I'll use a lot because it really is the best descriptor of the final effect of this book. While early sections are funny and some later sections truly ironic and cynical, the book ends with the remnants of an abandoned planet, creating a story of remorse, memories, and, in the very end, the possibility of hope. The Martian ghost town is an image that sticks with you. It's magical, unreal, and, yes, haunting.<br /><br />The Martian Chronicles is classic Bradbury in its relevance, however--while the book may end with an abandoned foreign planet, every event implies a lesson and every lesson can be carried over to our domestic culture on earth. Bradbury teaches cynicism, the ignorance and foolishness of humans, our weakness, our hubris (and with it our downfall), the fragility of all people on all planets, and, somehow, ultimately, the human/sentient ability to persevere. It may be about Mars, but this is a very human book. While taking the reader to a foreign landscape, Bradbury ultimately reminds him of his own backyard.<br /><br />There is a lot of good sci-fi out there, and there are better (more original, more unique) examples of alien races, but Bradbury's Martian Chronicles is still worth reading. It's easy to get into and addicting, a very interesting concept, delightfully ironic, a little bit religious, very spiritual, bittersweet and hopeful. I enjoy this book and have read it a few times myself. I recommend it to others, although there is other sci-fi worth reading too. Pick this one up if the idea interests you or if you like Bradbury's other books.tions truly ironic and cynical, the book ends with the remnants of an abandoned planet, creating a story of remorse, memories, and, in the very end, the possibility of hope.

B001N18HOQ|5.0|I was totally blown away with the redux CD of Ten. Ed's lead vocals have been brought up in the mix. That echo you hear in Ed's vocals are no longer in any of the songs. At first I was a little disappointed to not hear that. It grew on me. It is nice to hear this album like never before. Put on a nice pair of headphones, crank them and you will feel like the band is playing wherever you are The remastered original mix does sounds nice. Get this set in CD or Vinyl if you are new or a hardcore fan. I know this will please the hardcore fans. Sorry no casette re-issue of this album lol. That format is dead. This actually brings me to my next thing. Someone once told me that the orginal master tapes for Ten were not mastered for a CD release. This may explain why the CD's do not have a full sound to them. Don't get me wrong I enjoy the original release of Ten.     Before this re-issue came out I talked to some people online. They said oh this re-issue is a gimmick by the record company to milk more money out of the fans. That statement is complete BS. This is a really good re-issue of Ten.     I would review the DVD, but did not get that set. Bottom line is get this re-issue if you enjoy Ten. You cannot go wrong with this album.
0061148512|5.0|A largely autobiographic novel, The Bell Jar is a story of depression and mental illness. Esther is a poor student from a small town, on a scholarship to do guest editing for a New York magazine. Her time in New York, obsession with the power than men have over her, and own apathy gradually lead to a mental breakdown. Institutionalization, shock therapy, and suicide attempts follow, all closely mirroring Plath's own history. Written honestly, with great skill and talent, The Bell Jar gives insight into depression and mental illness and tells a very personal, depressing, unique story. It's a hard book to sum up and even to talk about, but I recommend it very, very highly to all readers.<br /><br />As fascinating as this book was, as clear as the writing is, I find it difficult to talk about. The Bell Jar is perhaps the best memoir/book on depression and mental illness, providing a very human, realistic, and identifiable view of depression from the inside out. Plath writes so clearly that it is impossible not to understand her protagonist and the events in her life. As such, it's an informative, invaluable novel which allows the reader to understand, even experience, a point of view that would otherwise be unknown to them--and so it can be a very emotional book to read.<br /><br />Besides this measure of intrinsic value, the novel simply reads and moves well. It is a memoir, not an detective story or a romantic novel, and as such the plot isn't the focus: rather, it is characters and experiences that matter. The honest, gritty memoir is reminiscent of The Catcher in the Rye (although, I would say, much better). But the story is still compelling: not matter how gritty, even through the mental breakdowns, Esther is so well-written that the reader ca identify and sympathize with her throughout. Furthermore, the text reads smoothly and quickly while still chronicling some truly harrowing and depressing events. The book is compelling, well-written, and worthwhile not only as a memoir of depression but also as a skillful novel.<br /><br />The rest of my thoughts about the text are lengthy rambles on women, madness/mental illness, and writing, but they are out of place here. The only thing to leave you with is a strong recommendation of The Bell Jar. Read it--there's nothing more complex than that. It is an accessible novel, both in length and writing style; it is skillful, a masterly work; the description of depression, of treatment, of interaction with the rest of the world is worthwhile for anyone to read. I highly recommend this book and am very grateful that I finally got around to reading it myself.epression but also as a skillful novel.

B0017WCG48|2.0|I have compared the re-maser vinyl of MOP to an original, and was pretty shocked by what i found. The MOP vinyl remaster does not have that nice warm sound the original MOP vinyl does. Also the drums are barely audible at times in the songs. The symbols are also further back in the mix. If you are on a budget or want the best sound for your money. Go with getting the MOP 2000 remaster on CD, or an original MOP vinyl. Even the Music For Nations MOP Vinyls sound way better than this new vinyl remaster from Warner. Don't get me wrong I am a hardcore Metallica fan since 1995. Just steer clear of these remasters of Metallica albums on vinyl.  Update:   I am going to review another edition of this CD. I have just aquired the 1999 MFSL Steve Hoffman remaster on a 24 karat CD. This edition of the album blows the original or 1995 remaster to CD out of the water in terms of sound quality. The album no longer sounds a little harsh to the ears. From what i heard the vocals, percussion,guitars and  some bass notes have more presence. There is some stereo panning in a few songs that i had never heard in the 1995 CD. The album now has the smoothness, and fidelity of a vinyl record but you get it in a much smaller package. All the original artwork is offered up on the CD release too. A nifty die cut slip case with art on it too. I would recommend this version of a person that cares about the sound quality of their music. Not to say the 1995 CD version of MOP sounds bad because it sounds good to my ears. I now prefer this version over previous CD editions.
B000009RC2|5.0|The power and drive remains incredible on this August 1971 release, as John McLaughlin delivers a classic in fusion and showing the potential of the electric guitar as a lead instrument.<br /><br />The debut album for the band - McLaughlin, Rick Laird (b), Billy Cobham (d), Jan Hammer (k), Jerry Goodman (v) - reached #11 and #89, respectively, on Billboard's jazz and pop album charts.<br /><br />The initial two tracks - Meeting of the Spirits, Dawn - are statements from a new trail being paved from McLaughlin's work with Miles Davis. The Dance of Maya sizzles, while the Noonward Race is arguably Hammer's finest statement with the group, as his ego is kept in check for this solid performance, from start to finish.<br /><br />The eight tracks are part of the foundation for the emerging fusion revolution that would propel jazz into an impressive cross-over appeal with rock fans throughout the 1970s.
B00008V5VN|5.0|Dopesmoker is heavy, in the heaviest way possible. And its very, very long, epic and definitely an 'experience' that is more than just a regular record. Those with short attention spans should stay away from this record.    The title track, 'Dopesmoker' is a 63 minute journey through a mystical land where people worship weed. Yup. The lyrics are about a weed-quest. While the storyline may be a little hokey to some, its delivered in such an epic and doom metal laden way, that its undeniably enjoyable; the perma-baked crowd will certainly find a new religion here.    As it is, 'Dopesmoker' will be a very hard album for some to enjoy as there is much repetition. Some riffs go on for as long as 6 minutes, and the entirely sober crowd may find it a bit pretentious and boring. However, if you can stick with it and withstand the pummeling riffs you will find much to love. The drums are always epic, crashing and very heavy. The bass is low, rumbling and placed at the front of mix, where it should be. The vocals are a hoarse wail, barely audible. While the riffs can get repetitive, solos are abundant and executed perfectly.    Sleep aren't the kind of band that make the most technical or creative music, but it sure is heavy and interesting, and if you're in an altered state prepare to lift off to another dimension. That's what its all about here, altered states and long journey's.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|and all its typical tired cliches? then get this. theres nothing like it out there.
1416914307|2.0|THIS REVIEW HAS MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS... DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW SOME MAJOR PLOT TWISTS    I'm normally not someone who can tell plot twists ahead of time (I never figured out the twist in The Sixth Sense), so when I see something coming a mile ahead, you KNOW a book is predictable. CC completely telegraphed everything that was coming. I started having my suspicions about Sebastian early on in meeting him, and once it was mentioned that he had blond hair, I knew it without a doubt (turns out that Sebastian is not only a spy for Valentine, but Valentine's son). And of course it was obvious from the earlier books that Jace and Clary were NOT brother and sister.     The problem with this series is that CC seems to be too afraid of killing her major characters. She puts in 'killing' scenes only to bring the characters back to life some way or another (for example -- Simon). So when Jace was killed, I wasn't at all sad, because I knew there was no way CC would have the guts to permanently off one of the main characters. And yes, she ended up bringing him back. Of course. Also, on her blog, CC once mentioned that one of the Lightwoods would die. But I knew she wouldn't have the guts to kill Alec or Isabelle. So when Isabelle was attacked, I didn't worry.     So to sum up -- this story is just way too obvious. You would probably be able to guess what happens long before it happens.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is a great CD if you like Guns N Roses. It has all my favorite songs on it from them.
031606792X|1.0|Ha... I really hate myself for lowering my IQ every time I read a Twilight series book.... If you are thinking of buying these books, let me tell you how I feel after reading them all.    I have 4 main issues with these books.   *Characters are 2-dimensional  *Books are bad written (believe me I've read better written manuscripts)  *It doesn't contain a nice message (if the author expected it to have... well she must have done it wrong because we all missed it)  *Lack of interesting and original plot   I will explain these four points as frankly as I can with my opinion and feelings about it.    I like to write, I've never done it professionally but I would like to do it someday. I really hate when people say that Meyer's writing is flawless or that her books are wonderfully written. I can't still believe she is being compared to JKR!! I'm not saying JKR is the best writer ever... but she really did a good job PLANING her 7 books and DEVELOPING her characters. I think Meyer doesn't even know those two words... or at least she has never quite understood both concepts.     The saddest thing of all is that not only Meyer wrote a bad series of novels (if you could call them novels rather than fan fiction), but an editor read them too! And there were actually people who published a bad written book!!! She had tons of grammatical and syntax errors... and I noticed them even though I only know English as a second language... Moreover, the fact that she has studied literature and she doesn't have a more extended vocabulary is actually pitiful.     The truth is that the books have a lot of flaws. The one that I just couldn't live with is the fact that an insipid, dull and unrealistic character (I'm convinced no one can be that stupid, reckless, selfish and oblivious to everything around her) like Bella gets to have her fairytale... it's just stupid because when Meyer tried to portray a very human and realistic character with Bella... she just missed the whole point.     AllBella does is complaining about her boring and dull life in the first book, she does nothing to solve this. She has no interests, no aspirations, no goals in life, no hobbies... She is clumsy and thinks she isn't pretty, as a lot of girls do... yes, wow that makes her so human (?!) Bella's character is an insult to women.     Everyone in the story is like: \\"Oh, yes we all think Bella is beautiful and smart! Oh, she is sooooo intelligent!\\" Please!! Just because she points out a few obvious things that no one else had realized. Big deal!! Any normal clever person could have logically pointed out those things... that felt like a knife in my brain...     Seriously, I even feel bad with myself after reading this... What's the whole point of cultivating my intelligence if dumb girls can get what they want?    What's the point of developing self-esteem to succeed in life if she didn't need it to get her happy ending? Whatever happened to \\"love yourself first so you can love others\\"?    What's the whole point of making an effort to self-control myself when everyone praises Bella for being reckless and stupidly passionate... Don't get me wrong here, I am a romantic. I like good romance novels, movies... whatever happens to talk about love has got my attention... but, this? Why did Bella ever \\"fall in love\\" with Edward? Oh, yeah because he is \\"perfect\\" and \\"godlike\\" and is soooo gorgeous.... besides he lets her get away with everything she wants... Did they ever actually fight? NO!!! At least a tiny discussion that lasted more than 3 pages... and ended in one of them saying I'm sorry.... if it ever did... it never tasted real.    What's the whole point of being humble and learning to say \\"I'm sorry\\" if a heroin didn't need to do so?    Oh! Are you telling me you have got to be stupid, whiny, prideful, dependant, and you've got to have commitment issues so you can get your fairytale? Oh, my! What have I been wasting my whole life in???     Edward's character is unbelievably 2D. He is just the author's fantasy or her daydream. Who wouldn't want a guy who would just give you everything that you want? Well... call me a freak but I very much rather have someone who trusts me to make my own choices and who trusts me to be strong than an overprotective and controlling guy. Bella is selfish from the first book just for doing everything she wants even though that hurts Edward or someone else. Especially with Edward and Jacob, she never cared that much of what either of them felt whenever her interests or \\"needs\\" were in the way. That kind of dependant love is sick, and that's not just me talking... ask any psychologist... I don't understand how somebody could call her unselfish or selfless.    Jacob is the only 3D character... he has his flaws and his virtues. He goes through a process throughout the books. He has a personality, he is sarcastic, HE has a hobby, but most important he makes his own choices and cares not only for himself but for others as well. He seems like the only human character... as ironic as that can be, given the fact that he isn't normal. Meyer gave him an awful ending anyway, at least from my point of view. The only bearable part in Breaking Dawn... the chapters narrated by Jacob... not because of the story... but because he has got a personality and realistic emotions.    I would go over to prove my fourth point, but this review is long enough... and I think I've proved that if you consider yourself intelligent and you like reading something witty this is definitely not for you. Believe me you will get angry more often than laughing while you read... unless you are really suffering... quit reading. Believe me I had to quit reading when it all got more boring than it had to at chapter 24 of this book. I know the ending becuase I read the summary on the internet.    Why I went through the whole series? I don't know... maybe I'm stupid as well... but be smarter than me... don't read the books.
B00000DC7J|5.0|I first heard about Piazzolla listening to WZBC in Boston.  I immediately fell in love with his music.  I rushed out and picked up \\"Zero Hour\\" as used vinyl (and now own on CD).  The world that this album painted in my head was like none I'd ever journeyed to before.  A few years later I was privileged to catch the film \\"Tangos in Exile\\" (not available on DVD).  It was a semi-autobiographical account of an Argentinian musician exiled in Paris.  The world of that film was the world I envisioned listening to this album.  I have since then acquired much of the Piazzolla catalogue.  \\"Zero Hour\\" remains my favorite.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Twin Peaks is remarkable for several reasons.  It was one of the first American TV series to attempt a more sophisticated narrative; the plots and subplots on Twin Peaks were a huge departure from traditional fare.  Modern television, from Lost to the Sopranos, owes a great deal to the more complex narrative structure Lynch and Frost employed on this show.  It is also remarkable for introducing a notoriously difficult director to a mass audience.  While lacking the bizarre aspects of \\"Eraserhead\\" or later ventures such as \\"Mulholland Dr.,\\" Twin Peaks is still far more surreal than what is generally expected from American broadcasts.<br /><br />But Twin Peaks would not enjoy the spectacular following it does were it not for the strong plot and unique characters it involves.  Lynch really shines as a storyteller in this series, in particular the first season.  Using his trademark dreamlike technique, Lynch presents a microcosm of American culture, one that is darker and more skewed yet eerily familiar.  His ability to draw the viewer into the murder of Laura Palmer is just astounding, and one of the finest storytelling feats I've encountered.  MacLachlan's performance as Agent Dale Cooper is one of the most memorable in TV history.  The supporting cast also provides noteworthy performances as the eccentric townspeople.  The coupling of effective storytelling and world-class acting, for me, makes this one of the greatest TV shows of all time.<br /><br />A note on the DVD: I purchased my copy in late 2008, and did not encounter the problems some viewers have noted with the third and fourth discs.  Ask about the age of the DVDs if you're buying this used.<br /><br />Assuming you're a Lynch fan (and you wouldn't be here if you weren't) this is splendid way to spend some of your disposable income.  Five stars, highly recommended.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|I grew up with Brian and I am so happy to see him and his band doing so well.  Buy this cd... Thanks
B001O5LVPI|4.0|I have grown to like the film more as time has gone by.    Good story, the Stitch character became very popular.    Beautiful animation.  Nicely designed DVD package.    Had a point to the story about family but did NOT make people sick in getting the point across.    Already the 2cd DVD release of the film.  I REMEMBER SEEING THEY WERE ORIGINALLY GOING TO RE-RELEASE IT ON DVD IN 2004.      Ok, normal, decent extras with this DVD package.  I normally enjoy the \\"Making of\\" segments.    But, the rest of this DVD package.  A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT DISNEY.    WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?    1.  THESE HORRIBLE HAVE THE LITTLE FLIP OPEN PARTS TO GET INTO THE CASE/JEWEL BOX  Some Disney DVD's have them some do not.  HOW ABOUT NONE DISNEY?  2.  Is Disney  thinking it is 10 year ago at the beginning of DVD's?  WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THE PLAIN, SILVER DISCS?   This film has beautiful animation but yet THERE IS NOTHING ON THE DISC    I hope Disney does better in the future with the 3rd DVD release of the film.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|If they were trying to make this better than Casino Royale - they failed.  An hour into the film, I was waiting for it to be over with.  It was that boring.  Yes, there was a lot of action, but that was to compensate for such a boring, horrible story.  I am a huge James Bond fan, but this movie was horrible.  What is with the anti-American jabs?  Who provides the most money for these movies? Americans!  And you want to make fun of them?  James Bond would be the first one to tell you that sometimes you have to work with a  villain to accomplish your objective.  They tried to make this movie political and it just proved horrible and not worth seeing again.  Leave politics and pc out of it!
0007189958|5.0|I just received this book and realized that it is the same book as Rosie Dunne, which I had just finished reading.  I was pretty disappointed; the descriptions do not even tell you that- kind of mix it up so you do not realize, but it is a great book.
B001JNNE64|5.0|This film is one of the best films ever. Every single second of it is captivating and it has the best soundtrack ever.  And if you really love classical music as I do, you will love it even more.  The image is not absolute amazing but is really good. You can see almost every detail in the walls at the palaces and indoor scenes.  The sound is also very good, the only problem for my is the difference between dialogues and music, music sounds louder and I had to lower volume some times.    EXTRAS:  Music CD: The track corresponding to the Queen of the night aria from The magic flute is missing.  Digital Copy: Not tested yet.    If you like films, you mut own this. Is one of the best.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Austrailia ..... a most interesting place for this story. The acting is excellent, Nicole Kidman and Huge Jackman are a great team and very comfortable with each other. The setting is spectular ... and keeps you completely involved with it's story-line. A good movie for all ages ... and it's nice to watch where there isn't a lot a foul language. Our family enjoyed this movie and our neighbors borrowed it.
0307346617|5.0|I've read this book twice.  The first time I read it over a period of two weeks.  Every single night during those two weeks, I had a zombie-inspired nightmare.  This book is excellent.  What struck me was the realistic treatment of the average people in the stories.  The so-called \\"political messages\\" in the book did not slow me down at all.  In fact, they were an integral part of the plots.  This is the book I would give to a group of high schoolers to get them to start reading, and yet it's not dumbed-down at all.  I found this book fascinating.  It has spawned many fun, interesting discussions with friends.  Absolutely recommended.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|If you haven't read James Lee Burke then this is a good introduction to him and his interesting mix of gumbo-based bayou cops and characters. The visual flow is some of the best I've seen in film in quite sometime while the storyline does a decent enough job in following Burke's book. I'd like to see the Director's cut.<br />  Tommy Lee Jones is a natural for the lead and oddly enough there's some physical resemblence too between he and Burke or maybe it's just my memory from when I spoke briefly to Burke at a signing years ago.<br />  This is also a fine beginning and by that I mean, let's hope for more from Jones and Hollywood for the many excellent books in this series. How or even why this missed the theaters is beyond me but then so is Algebra but X isn't an unknown factor here when it comes to good entertainment. This may well be your answer to finding a good movie.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|This an epic movie with old style panoramic views.  Excellent pictures of the Australian outback.  Acting is  true to the time the movie is placed in.  Overall very  enjoyable.
0452289963|3.0|Tolle's book in a good look at the man unfinding and finding himself while redefining his own philosophical leanings. He has walked a mile or two in his own shoes and explains the awakening process in Taoist-like fashion.<br />  It is an awakening, of sorts, advice to find purpose but shouldn't be confused with being the 'best' shortcut for our own journeys. Living in the present, in the NOW, is always a good idea but having a direction doesn't hurt either. Considering its Buddhist leanings the past has offered Tolle some direction as well.<br />  Often, where we go has a lot to do with where we've been and knowing where not to go based on our own scrapes, bumps, or bruises. The past offers some sound advice to any route we take. While there is nothing we can do to change it there is much we can do to better understand it.<br />  History has value. Our problem is heeding it. Well, that and all of the matching luggage we seem to carry with it. Maybe, like the airlines, if we charged for the excess baggage we carry, we might leave behind what we don't need?<br />  Not a bad book for the modern ego.
B000M06K5C|3.0|Not as fun as Silent Alarm, and not as grandly sublime as Intimacy, this album is easily forgotten save a few key tracks.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Though I downloaded the album for free. I just didn't feel as if I owned the music soundtrack at all. It's a good thing I stumbled onto this while buying twilight apparel. Great music album, I'm actually proud I bought this.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|First off let me say I am not a fan of \\"double dipping\\" but I made an exception for this disc after purchasing the DVD version several months back I knew it was a must own on BD when I saw it come out last week.  For those who thought it was full screen, relax it just like the DVD, 16:9 widescreen.  I give the picture quality 4/5 stars.  It is an amazing improvement over the SD DVD.  Slight grain and some noticeable edge enhancement keep it from being a perfect 5.<br /><br />Now for the hidden Easter Egg I found!  The Menu list only 2 Channel PCM Stereo or Dolby Digital 5.1 BUT I was cycling through the audio formats on my remote and low and behold DTS 5.1 - HD Master popped up on the screen !!!!!!  It was a HUGE improvement.  All of the sudden the audio exploded out of the A/V receiver with jaw dropping clarity.  I give the audio 5/5.<br /><br />This has become my defacto concert demo disc until David Foster gets together with Andrea Bocelli and they re-release the 2006 \\"Under the Desert Sky\\" on Blu-Ray (please, please!).

B001MYIXAC|1.0|1) the translated English subtitles are changed and do greatly mutilate the experience that the theatrical subtitles provided. Magnet films has acknowledged this but will offer no exchange program and has refused to stop distributing this defective disc.  2) the disc is defective in that there is a subtitle selection other than English called, \\"narrative English\\" and it is completely blank. There is not a single subtitle on that track. Magnet released a defective product then said it wasn't defective just creatively manipulated because they didn't want to pay for the very well done theatrical subtitles. If you must own this movie now go buy the region free Swedish release. it has the theactrical subs intact.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|I'm a 20 year veteran fan of Bruce's and I'm sorry I'm not going to be too kind to this album just because he's the Boss. Strike one, I have to say is that no artist in recent history has ever been able to accomplish having a great successful new album made up of old sessions (this was mostly recorded during the sessions for 'Magic'). Strike two, no one can tell me any different that at least a certain amount of reasoning for releasing this album so quickly within' a year was to capitalize on Bruce's own campaign for Obama. Mixing politics and music is absolutely insulting, just stop already!!! As far as the songs, 'Outlaw Pete' is just very sneaky and cunning sounding, epic if you will. It could easily contend for the 'Jungleland' of the 21st century. 'Working on a Dream' isn't bad until the whistle while you work theme comes into play, it just makes my skin crawl at how cheesy that is. 'My Lucky Day' is one of the highlights to me, it could have easily fit on the Born In The U.S.A. album, yeah Bruce can still rock like that if he wants. 'Queen Of The Supermarket' is just plain weird, it's another one those Brian Wilsonesque songs that was first featured on the 'Magic' album. The only concept in the song I like is the orchestration and the checkout scan chirps at the end of the song. 'What Love Can Do', is another highlight which would've fit nicely on the last album. 'Life Itself' is a pretty song, dramatic at best. Why Bruce chose to sing the way he does on this song though is beyond me. It sounds like his jaw is wired shut, and his voice almost comes across as some Holy man singing a hymn, it's just plain irritating. 'Good Eye', ehhhh. 'Surprise, Surprise' I have no words for, it's really that bad. 'The Wrestler' one word ...awesome!!!!!! This is easily the centerpiece on the album. So why the hell is it a bonus track then, and why the hell is shortened by 2 minutes!?!?!?! The version on the soundtrack of the film by the same name is almost 5+ minutes with a gorgeous piano outro. Ughhhh....you know, there's at least 4-6 songs on here that are worth hearing and having. My recommendation is that Bruce should have just made 'Magic' a double album and called it a day until he started fresh new sessions for a something completely new and without the political capitalization.
0810993139|3.0|Wimpy kid series is cute but overrated. Relatable stories of kid's embarrassing schooldays, but written with wit that adults can appreciate. Worth reading at the library, but not worth buying for $12 at a bookstore. There are a plenty of books that offer more challenging reading material.
0670020478|2.0|This book is filled with somewhat uplifting stories mostly about celebrities or otherwise famous individuals and how they reached success.  There was no real guidelines for practical application in the average person's life.  The book just really was not interesting enough for me and wish it was laid out in bullet points with steps to reach that goal listed underneath.  I wish he had shared stories about the average \\"Joe or Jane\\" and how they made the most of being in their \\"Element\\".  I wish I had saved my money and went to the local library and checked out \\"The Artist's Way\\" by Julia Cameron.
B000FC1K66|5.0|I was not impressed with the beginning of the book.  I couldn't figure out if it was the translation or the writing.  I felt that there was little description, very little dialogue and was simply telling the story - without much passion.  That's why I was so surprised by the end of the book.  The strength of the story itself touched me and made me think about the narrative and the issues contained therein long after setting the book aside.  Well worth it - a good read.  --sgb
B000QUT9RY|5.0|I have a pretty good hearing range, so most computer speakers sound flat and lifeless to me, or they try to compensate with phony sounding \\"stereo expansion\\" techniques that really just mask the flaws with more bass and some treble boost.  I bougtht these to do close-quarters video editing at my PC workstation, and they have exceeded my expectations.  There are different inputs, which is nice, and although they are a little large, the sound quality is definately worth it - it provides accurate, true to the source reproduction of your audio tracks, which lets face it, is what a speaker is supposed to do.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Like many reviewers here, I loved this movie.  Just wanted to make you potential buyers aware that apparently there are, or shortly will be, two alternate versions of the DVD floating around, with different takes on the translations for English subtitles.  Word has it in the movie geek discussion boards that the theatrical version of the subtitles is much better than that included with the initial DVD release.  See the following statement from Magnolia/Magnet, from around March 24, 2009:      \\"We've been made aware that there are several fans that don't like the version of the subtitles on the DVD/BR. We had an alternate translation that we went with. Obviously a lot of fans thought we should have stuck with the original theatrical version. We are listening to the fans feedback, and going forward we will be manufacturing the discs with the subtitles from the theatrical version. For those that wish to purchase a version with the theatrical subtitles, it will be called out in the tech specs box at the back/bottom of the package where it will list SUBTITLES: ENGLISH (Theatrical), SPANISH.\\"  The source for this info is [...]      So if this is important to you, be sure to take note of which version you are buying.      In any case, though, this is a fabulous, touching, creepy, gorgeous, just-about-perfect movie.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great hard workout that makes you feel like you worked out for hours and each level is only 30 minutes - she is a great trainer and it seems to be working out great for me.  If you dont have alot of time and want to feel like you are getting a good workout this is the DVD for you.
B001GQSY64|3.0|Not really a movie, but episode 0 of a TV series.  And the TV series is great!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is a brilliant piece of literary fiction, a late night page-turner, and extremely well written.  It's hard to classify this novel, and I believe that's part of what makes it such an outstanding read.  Diane Setterfield writes likes an author of literary classics and the novel is somewhat reminiscent of Dickens, not at all in the story line but in the depth and breadth of its plot, characters and prose.  My only disappointment is that I have to wait for the author's next book to come out, as it's her debut!  I highly recommend The Thirteenth Tale for all ages!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I've played PS3 without the rumble, on the classic controller, but it just seems like something is missing. The rumble is powerful in this controller and it is easy to hold. I like how the L2 and R2 buttons are more trigger like, as opposed to the controller with PS2 systems. I actually don't mind that the L1 and R1 buttons are not trigger.    The controller works beautifully wireless. It even turns on your PS3 when you turn on the controller if you have the switch on in the back of the system.    My ONLY complaint is that the center button can be easily pushed during gaming, locking you out of the game and bringing you to the Media Bar (XCross, I think it's called.) All you have to is push the button a second time to return, but every second counts in games and you can be easily snipped in Warhawk while trying to fix what you did.    I recommend these controllers.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I am obsessed with this cd. It's beyond great and I find myself wanting to listen to it every day! My 66 year-old father, 15 year-old sister, and 5 year-old son seem to feel the same way. We're all huge fans.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|There is no humour in this movie.  It is the worst movie ever made.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This CD is amazing, and that's why they won so many Grammy's for it! Coldplay is an amazingly creative band, and Chris Martin's voice is so soothing. \\"Viva la Vida\\" and \\"Strawbery Swing\\" are my favorite titles on this CD, but there are several great songs on here. I have (and love) all of their CD's, but I think this one is the most compelling. I'd love to see them in concert, but since tickets were so expensive, I'll have to enjoy my CD and just imagine :-)
B001ED7C58|5.0|I think the music is great but where is the song \\"let me sign\\" that Rob Pattinson (edward) sings? In the movie it plays when James bites Bella's wrist.

B001BGTWXI|3.0|this was actually the first Slipknot album i ever bought and listened to, and i thought it was garbage right off the back. it grew on me quickly, and i listened to it a lot. having said that, tracks 2-6 are really good but some of the ones after that are just kind of there. Subliminal Verses: Vol 3 is better but this is still a rockin album if you give it time to appreciate it.
1577314808|5.0|The Power of Now shook the foundations of my beliefs.  Eckhart's writing style is inviting and he explains difficult thoughts and ideas.  When I first read this several years ago, I put it down for a while, then my curiosity caused me to continue, and I'm glad I did.  The concept of the present time \\"the Now,\\" is on target with helping us realize - regretting the past or worrying about the future takes us away from the joy of now.    I recall a quote by an anonymous Nun which is a good summary of Eckhart's wonderful book:  \\"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift, that is why it is called the present.\\"  If you want to live now and find the peace which passes all understanding, read this book!
B001JNNE64|1.0|The nude scene where Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) bares her ample breasts for a leering Salieri really detracts from the movie.  It was not in the theatrical release and it should have been left where it belongs - on the cutting room floor.  Do we need nudity in every movie that comes out of Hollywood?  What a shame.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|I love this angsty over top rock album! Probably my favorite My Chemical Romance CD thus far.
045122499X|3.0|Very easy to read but it took a hundred pages for a story to develop. I started to loose interest around chapter 51 when corn was introduced as a major crop. Being an American Indian I know corn was not introduced to Europe until the late 15th century. The story ended with the mirrored climax of pillars. You knew who would triumph and who would self destruct. Not historical fiction, just fiction. This is no Pillars!
B001DJ7PR8|1.0|I hated this movie and don't get what all the hype was about. The main character vicki was annoying and I didn't care if she found love or not.  Scarlett johannsen was the only saving grace. There is also a narrator over the whole movie which makes it almost unbearable. I do not recommend this and it did not deserve ANY awards or accolades.  Watch Matchpoint  -- much better film.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|I cannot find a single thing wrong with this album. the only song that seems like its \\"just there\\" is Brompton Cocktail, but all of the other songs are just phenomenal and well done. my only complaint is that it is too short, but it is one phenomenal album. these guys have changed a lot since their first album, and if you still prefer their screaming and whatnot, you may not like this one. however, if you are like me and started liking them when they made city of evil, then you will love every moment of this album. this album grows on you, and if you know every song and then go see them in concert, that is THE best experience ever. they are PHENOMENAL live.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I bought this for my kids (okay, all of us...) and they loved it.  Filmed well before any of them were even thought of it's a timeless piece of adventure, fun and mystery that appeals to the kid in all of us.  Treasure and adventure is always nearby, we just have to open our eyes and want to see it.  Goonies, what a blast.
B000002B30|1.0|Greatest hits? How about renaming the title to Bruce Springsteen: Songs Nobody Listens to Anymore. Ever since Bruce changed his name from John Cougar Mellencamp his career has gone down hill fast.<br /><br />Also, what's with the guitar on the album cover? Sure, he's decent at playing piano, but trying to make him into some rocker who plays guitar is a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />While Born In the U.S.A. is a great song, and it's been widely used in political campaigns, the song is ludicrous considering this man is a Canadian citizen. His single claim to fame is a song about being born somewhere that he wasn't.<br /><br />Don't buy new, buy one of the 300,000 used copies for .99 cents if you must.

0525951113|4.0|My rating system;<br /><br />3 stars -  I liked the book.<br /><br />4 - I really liked the book.<br /><br />5 - I loved the book<br /><br />I'd give this book 3 and ½ stars, rounded up to 4 stars.  This was a good read.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book.  Even though it took me some time to read the 400 plus pages of the book, the plot kept me interested.  There were several surprising twists in the story that I thought the author handled quite well.  I did think the ending was weaker than the rest of the book, but I think there may be a sequel on its way.<br /><br />The Daemon, a computer program, is the invention of Matthew Sobol, the co-founder of CyberStorm Entertainment.  The Daemon has a life of its own, and it wrecks havoc on its enemies.  There are plenty of killings in this book!<br /><br />This book has lots of characters in it and a fair amount of computer terminology.  I believe that one does not have to be a computer expert though to appreciate this thriller.  I enjoyed it and I only have a very basic knowledge of computers.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to people who are interested in computers and/or mysteries.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|up until last year, i couldnt stand slipknot and i thought they were the worst band in the world. then i heard a few songs off their newest album, and i actually liked what i heard. a friend recommended this cd to me, and i loved a lot of songs on it. the highlights include \\"Duality\\" \\"Circles\\" \\"Vermillion (Part 1 & 2)\\" and \\"Before I Forget\\"
0792839749|5.0|we got this when my daughter was only 2 1/2.  Even though she was too young to undertand the story in entirety, she loves it (now 3).  She can sing the songs, and laugh and laughs and dances in the part at the end.      the classics are the best, no violence or bad language.  I am getting this as a gift for other kids too.  I highly recommend it.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Logitech stands out in a sea of rebranded Chinese knockoffs as a bona fide design firm. In my eyes, they are the Apple of the accessory market.<br /><br />I adore my VX and MX Revolution mice, their flywheel was a genius move and I cannot imagine life without it. I see Logitech's industrial design is very Porsche-like, following the Porsche dictum of \\"form follows function\\".<br /><br />This said, I have just spent my first week with their new G13 gamepad, and I think Logitech may have raised their high bar for design. This is one sexy beast, to be sure.<br /><br />My interest in this piece was specifically for World of Warcraft. I don't consider myself a serious gamer, as I don't play or even really recognize a lot of the titles that the G13 supports. I however became a Warcraft fan since my son convinced me to open an account and go questing with him. A great family activity, and after three years we are a 3 account family and travel Azeroth a few hours each week as a happy pack.<br /><br />My professional background is technology design and engineering, as well as a Mac programmer and software interface designer.<br /><br />The past year or so I had been using a Belkin Nostromo N52. I bought the device about 3 years ago, but could not use it successfully because the Belkin Mac drivers never worked correctly. I discovered ControllerMate, a Mac programming utility through a friend about a year ago. It is a superb, professional piece of software, and with it, I had the old N52 jumping through Warcraft hoops. I was pretty happy with the N52 in this config, but always open for a better solution. I saw a picture of the G13 about a month ago, spotted Mac compatibility in a gaming device, no less, and I am off to Logitech site to see more.<br /><br />One of the great things about Logitech is that when they say one of their products supports the Mac, they actually have Mac programmers to write real software that looks and performs up to the expectation of a veteran Mac user. The great majority of gaming companies and devices provide little or no support, or have a cursory piece of poorly-designed ported Windows software that make the product much less functional on the Mac.<br /><br />In a word, the G13 piece is stunning. I don't know where to start, except to say that the initial tactile experience with the unit exceeded my high expectations from previous reviewers and looking at photos.<br /><br />First of all, the unit is hefty, containing a metal weight embedded in the upper half of the unit. In photos, that large area that says G13 on the bottom is actually a big chunk of metal. Couple this heft with a number of large rubber feet, and the G13 literally become a component of the surface you place it on, imparting an incredibly solid feel. On the top of the unit, the heel of your left hand rests on a firmly-padded textured rubber surface. It has a heavily grained leather-like feel to it, providing a very comfortable no-slip anchor point for your hand.<br /><br />The unit is fairly large, but I have big hands and it was just perfect for me. The arc shape mirrors the natural curve of my relaxed hand. People with smaller hands may feel differently, but I cannot comment on that.<br /><br />From a functional/comfort perspective, after about an hour of figuring out a basic config I liked (comes with a Warcraft profile, but I wanted it a bit different), I played 3 hours of WoW and suffered no fatigue at all. I look forward to making the perfect config for me over time.<br /><br />Digging a bit deeper, there are 22 numbered backlit keys on the main board (G1-G22), with cup shapes molded into the reverse T movement keys (WASD equiv.) so you can home in your position without looking. There is a dedicated button to control the display and key backlighting, a small joystick that fits under my thumb and has 3 additional buttons, one to the left and bottom, and another is a press on the top of the stick. It also has 4 softkeys for the applets that run in the display, and another button to cycle through the applets. The G13 comes with 6 applets, although only 4 work on its monochrome display. They cycle between displaying CPU & RAM usage, Time/date, and a countdown/stopwatch time controlled by the softkeys. There are 3rd party websites like G15mods.com that have a growing library or compatible applets, plus the G13 comes with an SDK to develop your own if you are so inclined.<br /><br />Applications like World of Warcraft that have G13 support, will feed their applet into the G13 display upon opening or selecting the app. As of this writing, the Warcraft applet is only available in the PTR beta version, that should be released in a couple of weeks or so.<br /><br />Having 3 banks of 22 keys is a lot, but Logitech made a cool way to know where you are at a glance. The three shifted banks can change the color of the backlighting and the display to any color you select. I chose blue for general operation, red for raiding and green for farming. Each set has its own optimized button functions.<br /><br />There is also a button for quick macro recording, simply hit it, select a G key or button to assign it to, do whatever you want on your keyboard, hit the Quick Macro again, and you have a new macro. Works great.<br />Another unique feature is that your profiles and macros can be stored in the G13's own internal memory, so you can take all you commands with you to another machine.<br /><br />I predict this will be a very popular item once folks hear about it. Buy with confidence.<br /><br />Pros -<br /> Very Comfortable, and it is one sexy beast, style-wise.<br /><br /> I love the color selectable backlighting on the keys and display<br /><br /> Instant one dedicated button macro recording is superb.<br /><br /> The G13 can store game profiles in the unit itself, so you can take your macros and profiles to another computer by just plugging in your pad.<br /><br /> Heavy and solid, feels like it is bolted to thedesk.<br /><br /> Comes with a Mac SDK for programming your own applications for the display.<br /><br />Cons, and I feel rather petty here given how much I like the piece...<br /><br /> Mac software requires a download, PC comes on a CD.<br /><br /> The button that is activated by pushing the top of the joystick requires too much effort, and is not easy to use.<br /><br /> Some may complain at the $80 price tag, I found it an excellent value, really nothing else like it when you understand its sophistication.<br /><br /> Would like a .pdf manual, or printed...but that is just me. The online help and tutorials are detailed and well done.

0439023483|5.0|I teach Junior High Social Studies, read Stephen King's review and decided this was something I'd like. Bought the hardback, read it in 3 days, then re read it again.  I loaned it to my English Teacher room neighbor & friend, and haven't seen it since. It has been through the entire Jr. High English (6 teachers) and several others, the library cannot keep it on the shelf and students have heard word of mouth that I'm the originator and come to me to borrow my copy. Which I do not have.
B00006ADD5|3.0|I think this sites product review says it all, even though it thinks it's saying something else.  The review says \\"If your only option is to view a `pan & scan' version, it's best not to bother; this is a film for which the widescreen format is utterly mandatory.\\"  Now, what they are saying without realizing it is that this movie is less a film and more a spectacle.  It's a mere Hollywood blockbuster masked over and presented as an Oscar caliber production.  I know that this is a film lauded by many and is considered one of the greatest films of all time, but in all honesty I have to say that it is a beautiful yet somewhat empty film.<br /><br />It reminds me of my feelings on `The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' or even `The English Patient'.  Really though, I probably consider both of those films to be better than this one.<br /><br />The film tells of T.E. Lawrence's uniting of the Arabian tribes during his military service in World War I.  As he works with the tribes as they wage war against the Turks he begins to realize a part of himself that he didn't know before.  Sadly, he remains such an enigma that we as the audience don't ever really get to know him.<br /><br />That's my biggest issue here.  \\"Lawrence of Arabia' is like a really pretty painting.  It has beautiful landscapes and beautiful people, and yes, on a big screen it looks utterly amazing; but like that picture the purpose of `artist's intent' is left up to the audience to uncover alone.  It is an ambiguous journey that winds up being unfulfilling since we are given little to no real insight on who this Lawrence really is.  Peter O'Toole tries very hard, and with what he is given he delivers quite well, but in the end he cannot shed much light on this man and thus his efforts go forth unsuccessful.<br /><br />There is a story here, one of heroism, that is tackled pretty well; and there are certain moments where there is a glimmer of light on this man (especially when Lawrence admits to liking taking another man's life) but overall I feel that this film is rather empty.<br /><br />I love how some who are so devoted to this film feel the need to say that if you find this boring or don't like it then you must have the attention span of a hummingbird (direct quote there).  Truth be told, I've sat through Bergman's four hour masterpiece known as `Fanny and Alexander' as well as his six part conversation `Scenes from a Marriage' and I found it completely riveting and utterly absorbing.  Could it be that we find this boring because it is.  Boring has nothing to do with how long a film is or how loud and action filled it is.  Boring has to do with finding now emotional connection to a film.<br /><br />I found no real connection here.<br /><br />Director David Lean has received a lot of praise for his directorial efforts on this film; but I think that praise is blind and somewhat one sided.  We have to remember that directing is more than painting a pretty picture, for it is up to the director to engage the audience's emotions as well.  I said this before with regard to Minghella's work in `The English Patient' as well as Fincher's emotionally vapid work in `Benjamin Button', and recently some friends and I were discussing Mel Gibson and his lack of emotional connection in his work, most notably `Braveheart'.  These are specific cases of directors who can visually stimulate us yet fail to capture our emotions (I want to make a brief note that NORMALLY Fincher and the late Minghella are brilliant directors; these are just two cases of times when they weren't complete in their directorial efforts).  Lean falls in that category for me here.  He struggles to find a human connection and thus winds up giving us half a movie.<br /><br />It's beautiful to look at, that is for certain, but it's really nothing more than that.rall I feel that this film is rather empty.

B001N18HOG|3.0|Because I hadn't listened to Ten in a great while, listening to the new BOB tracks was kind of cool at first. But unfortunately those songs don't mesh at all with BOB's production style. Those songs have an inherent big stadium rock sound (maybe even a top 40 straight forward style) and I'm assuming that's part of why their original producer did what he did to these songs. Now with Vs, Brendan O' Brien should have won an award for that album because it's fantastic. Vs is my favorite PJ album by far. This to me is another example of why PJ and their fans may be further apart on their musical direction than most other bands. Their personal agenda overrides anything that is in the musically appreciative interest of their fans. I'm sure the fans would have voted to reproduce Vitalogy and would have never touched Ten. Also, I think this is a great and selfish diss to the original producer of Ten unless he was in complete approval of it. But then again I say if you can reproduce Vitalogy with someone who produced Neil Young or someone like T-Bone Burnett and make it more acoustic that would probably mend some fences in my opinion. Then again PJ fans have to be the most forgiving of any fans out there.
B00005J6T0|5.0|I was 8 years old when True Blue was released, I liked Madonna on her 1983 release Madonna, loved Madonna on 1984 release Like a Virgin, became a fanatic when True Blue hit, and have stayed a fanatic ever since. The album is Madonnas' biggest selling studio album to date with over 30 million sold to date, now thats a lot of records. It was an era when Madonna was on everyones lips, young, fresh, sexy. True Blue took her into Iconic Status. The album is fun, fun, fun with a touch of sentiment, fun all the way with a string of #1's, Papa Don't Preach (classic), Open your heart (sexy check out the video, its amazing that Madonna has maintained that body till today), Live to tell (my absolute favourite Madonna ballad till this day that ballad stands the test of time) True Blue (sweet, lovely sing-a-long pop song) and of course the incredible Spanish inspired La isla Bonita (another classic that just hits your soul, loooove that song) all # 1 world hits. She scored #1's in UK and US simultaneously incredible. Madonna co-wrote and produced every single song on the album with Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray (a wonderful team, that also worked together on her masterpiece \\"Like A Prayer\\".    The album is pure Pop/Dance a great listen, never a boring moment I bought this remastered copy last year, amazing, the sound will blow you away. Madonna amazes till this very day, I am like her little brother growing up with her music for 25 years of my 30 years of existence (and I am not even gay). But True Blue is what made me put her in my heart for good.    This is a classic for any Pop lover, if you are a Madonna fan and do not have this album, you are not really a fan (he he)A must have in your collection.
B00009RDGA|5.0|Truly one of my favorite films of all time, `Paper Moon' deserves a spot in the catalogues of time as one of the best films ever made concerning the important relationship that buds between a father and daughter.  I am moved to feel so many differing emotions when watching this delightful film.  I laugh, I cry; I am moved in so many ways when reflecting on the beautiful development taking place on screen, and that is a true testament to remarkable filmmaking.<br /><br />Yes, `Paper Moon' is a complete package if I ever saw one!<br /><br />The film tells of orphan Addie Loggins.  At her mother's funeral she meets Moses Pray, a man who very well may be her father, even if he won't consider the possibility.  After a little nudging he agrees to drive Addie to live with her Aunt, beings that she has no kin living close by.  Moses is a con man, and soon he finds out that this little girl is better at conning than he is, and so they form a team so-to-speak.  Along the way they pick up dancer Trixie Delight and her side-kick Imogene, a decision that does not sit well with Addie.<br /><br />`Paper Moon' is above all else a story about the need to connect to our family especially family as close as parents and children.  Addie has this hole inside, a hole that can only be filled with the love of a father, and so when she becomes determined in her mind that this man is indeed her father she works like a dog to find that connection, even if it means becoming a con-artist.  The rapport between this real life father and daughter team (Ryan and Tatum O'Neal) is beyond words really.  They have such undeniable chemistry and they make each scene a delight to watch.  This is most definitely a career highlight for both actors, and the roles they will be remembered for forever.  Watching the progression of character on screen is such a joy, seeing them work from resentment and reluctance to admiration and respect to eventual love and embracement.<br /><br />This is not your typical family, but there is no denying they are a family.<br /><br />Both Madeline Kahn and P.J. Johnson also turn in wonderful supporting turns, complete with not only comedic timing but a pure sense of humanity that makes them so remarkably touching.  Kahn is a superb actress who relates very well with O'Neal here (both O'Neal's, but most effectively Tatum), which makes for some very moving and memorable scenes.<br /><br />`Paper Moon' is a technical marvel as well, shot in pristine sepia (black and white with a red filter), a decision that adds an almost earthy tone to the film (thank you Orson Welles).  Director Peter Bogdanovich should be commended for drawing out such a phenomenal performance from Tatum, a feat I hear was quite difficult for the director.  What he gets from her, and his entire cast really, is nothing short of remarkable.  Not only is `Paper Moon' an actors showcase and a delicate character study, but it has all the necessary elements (comedy, drama, action, suspense) to constitute it one of the most complete films I've ever had the pleasure of watching.<br /><br />Couple that with ample amounts of heart and you have a film I wouldn't hesitate to call `perfect'.ly, but there is no denying they are a family.<br /><br />Both Madeline Kahn and P.J. Johnson also turn in wonderful supporting turns, complete with not only comedic timing but a pure sense of humanity that makes them so remarkably touching.  Kahn is a superb actress who relates very well with O'Neal here (both O'Neal's, but most effectively Tatum), which makes for some very moving and memorable scenes.<br /><br />`Paper Moon' is a technical marvel as well, shot in pristine sepia (black and white with a red filter), a decision that adds an almost earthy tone to the film (thank you Orson Welles).  Director Peter Bogdanovich should be commended for drawing out such a phenomenal performance from Tatum, a feat I hear was quite difficult for the director.  What he gets from her, and his entire cast really, is nothing short of remarkable.

B0002NRQTS|2.0|By the end of the 1980s, after four releases in a synth rock vein with instrumentals and vocals alike far removed from rock-out savagery, Rush's popularity was beginning to fade. The tour for 1988's album HOLD YOUR FIRE saw half-empty venues and cancelled dates, while guitarist Alex Lifeson was feeling increasingly pushed to the side by all the keyboards. The trio knew they needed to make a change and PRESTO, released in 1989, shows them embarking in a slightly different tradition. It's not a complete departure, as songs like \\"Red Tide\\" and \\"War Paint\\" and could easily have fit in on the previous two albums. But in the main we find a much dimished use of synthesizers, and in tracks like \\"Show Don't Tell\\" and \\"Available Light\\", Lifeson returns to the spotlight.<br /><br />But the album is ultimately overall disappointing. The most readily noticeable flaw is Rupert Hine's production. The drums have no punch, the sound is flat with little variation in dynamic, and there's an incongruous edit in the second track. The other problem is that, as one listens through the whole album, Neil Peart's lyrics are perhaps his weakest in the band's entire career. At best, they are forgettable, with myself and many fellow Rush fans unable to recall half of what Geddy sang. At at worst, they are risible. The \\"boys and girls together\\" bit on \\"War Paint\\" makes me cringe almost as much as the infamous \\"Net boy, net girl, / send your signal 'round the world. / Put your message in a modem / and through it in the cyber sea.\\" lines of \\"Virtuality\\" on TEST FOR ECHO a few years later.<br /><br />I consider PRESTO the weakest Rush album released in the three decades since they moved to radio-friendly lengths. From talking to other Rush fans, I always thought this was the common opinion, and I'm baffled as to the high average review here. It's not a complete failure, as I occasionally listen to \\"Chain Lightning\\" and \\"Available Light\\", but this is one of the few Rush albums I'm reluctant to play through. Ironically, opinions about [[ASIN:B000001ESZ Hold Your Fire]], the album that drove so many people away in the late 1980s, seem to have improved over the last 20 years. On the other side of PRESTO, the following album [[ASIN:B0002NRQU2 Roll the Bones]] is also often seen as a solid effort.ally, opinions about [[ASIN:B000001ESZ Hold Your Fire]], the album that drove so many people away in the late 1980s, seem to have improved over the last 20 years.

B000002MUW|5.0|When reading Dance Floor Junkies Review it was like I wrote it, so spot on. I was 16 when Bedtimes Stories was released, just finished High School, I loved Madonna then even though everyone at the time hated her for the whole Erotica/Sex fiasco. I was young and also was abit taken aback nevertheless I loved Erotica, Madonna had already won me over. When she released Bedtime Stories, I was amazed, I loved that album, so underated it was even though it did have a few big chart hits, its a R&B Madonna with feeling, not even Hard Candy (which I love too) has that groove, I listen to this album even today, I am now 30. The songs that stood out for me are: 1. Survival (great harmonic vocals simple and pure, great beat) 2. Secret (groovy baseline one of Madonnas best R&B tracks to date, check out the remixes they are crazy) 3. Don't Stop (great beat, simple, catchy, groovy love it) 4. Inside of me - my favourite track even my dad loves it, reminds me of Janets \\"thats the way love goes\\" 5. Love tried to welcome me - a beautiful, clean cut ballad, with emotion never seen by the Pop Diva. 6. Sanctuary - mysterious, dark, hypnotic you will get lost in this amazing track. 7. Bedtimes Stories - a stand alone masterpiece, I remember when I listened to the album in the record store to consider buying it, I heard this song, so different, so layered in mystery, beats I never heard, Madonnas sexy vocals, I love this track my best techno - feel Madonna track ever, loved the video too why this song did not chart at No.1 or at least the top 5 on the billboard charts I do not know and last but definetely not least 8. Take a Bow - this track along with Live to tell (True Blue) are my all time favourite Madonna ballads, her biggest American hit ever a wonderful collaboration with Babyface.    I love Madonna so amazed that I have been listening to her since I was 5 (Madonna 1983 great album) live in South Africa and have saved up to go to London to watch her Sticky and Sweet Tour, never ever seen her live, only on DVD I will starve for a few months after that experience but hey Madonna you are worth it. Get Bedtimes Story in your collection its a great album.    Lenin

B00062RCBW|2.0|The product arrived \\"somewhat\\" as promised - neither early nor late. The discs were poor-to-moderate quality duplicates, shipped from China. Some discs were difficult to decode or read. The box set that arrived was not the box set that is advertised on Amazon.
B000EYK4GW|3.0|The content of the movie is excellent (as other reviews already point out), but the sound is horrible (am I the only reviewer to have experienced this problem?). I had to keep turning the volume up and down to be able to listen to some dialogues, and then not to have to shout over some other parts of the movie.<br /><br />Hard to believe that in these days and with so many technological advances, Disney cannot do any better at improving the sound of this DVD, especially given the price they are charging!

B001PE26QQ|5.0|To be honest, I thought this movie was going to be another one of those Chinese films where the fighters fly all over the place. I stand corrected. Ip Man, which I believe should be spelled as \\"Yip Man\\", was an amazing story of one man's ability to beat the odds with courage and strength.<br /><br />The movie focuses on Bruce Lee's Wing Chun master Yip Man who descends from a great martial arts lineage that can be traced back to Ng Mui, the shaolin nun who founded Wing Chun.<br /><br />Now, I want someone to explain to me how Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon received so many awards? Clearly, this is a movie that can easily take Best Foreign Language Film without breaking a sweat. I can't recall seeing such a well balanced kung fu drama.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor and add this one to your collection. I'm going to hold out for the Blu-ray edition that's coming soon.
B001N18HO6|5.0|For the ultimate collector!  If you love this album as much as me, this is definitely worth your time and money.  You do need at least a record player to experience the most of this package, but most of Pearl Jam's hardcore fans I'm sure already own one.  Kudos to the band for making the ultimate love letter to an already timeless record.
B001O8C5KK|5.0|I am in total agreement with Mr. Moore's review, especially on one point. Jonas Kaufmann is a splendid tenor whose voice and style best suit the German side of the repertoire rather than the Italian. But I feel this new \\"Butterfly\\" should be put into perspective. The recorded sound is impeccable; Pappano's conducting is as good as any on disc. Gheorghiu's voice and style suit Cio-Cio San very well. Is she the vocal equal of Leontyne Price in this role or the dramatic equal of Callas, Freni, Scotto, and de los Angeles? No, but she comes blessedly close. Looking back over the past twenty years, I'd pick her ovr any rivals. The warmth, intimacy, and femininity of her protrayal remind me of Anna Moffo.<br /><br />So many of the ingredients needed for a successful opera recording are present here, and they mesh so well, that I can begrudge Pinkerton his (minor) faults. After all, Kaufmann's voice is strong, well placed, ringing on top, and musically applied. Those qualities count for a lot, especially in the absence of a rising Italian tenor who might better him. (Villazon is tied up with a rival company, of course.) Ramon Vargas and Marcello Alvarez come closer to the timbre of a  true Puccini tenor, I suppose, but I think Kaufmann surpasses them in dramatic passion and electricity.
1582701709|5.0|This book is wonderful. It is all mind power ~ Mind Over Matter. I hate that I waited so long to read The Secret. I had read the reviews and many readers do not agree with this book. This book has really helped me to turn my aspect around on myself, the world and other people around me. We effect everyone and ourseves ~ if you think negatively, about your own situation or you are involved with gossip, or if you speak ill of people you know of, you just bring all the vibes you send out back to yourself, over and over - a cycle. Kinda like, \\"You reap what you sow\\". I think everyone should read The Secret. This book helps you learn how to focus on what you DO want not what YOU DON'T want.     When I was reading the first chapter of The Secret, the company my husband was working for closed and about two thousand people (including my husband) were laid off (March 2009), The Secret has kept me in good spirits. Very good self-help book.     I let a co-worker borrow it as soon as I finished reading. She asked if she could read it after me when I was only half way through the book. She could already tell that The Secret had made an good impact on my life.
1840025239|3.0|This is a great play adaptation with a HUGE cast list. Consequently, this is a LONG play to read aloud.  There is not a set design concept included nor a comprehensive property list.  I do think that it includes much more plot than other stage versions but deviates greatly from the film version starring Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon.  Overall a good read, good value, nice adaptation.

Jace comes up with a plan to leave Clary behind, a plan that blows up in his face when Simon gets thrown into jail in Idris.<br />Off she goes to find a cure for her mother, which she learns is in a spell book her mother had. with the help of Magnus and Jace, Clary sets off to find the book and find a way to help Simon. all the while Valentine has very evasively entered the city, even has a spy inside the clave and is preparing to attack Idris and killing anyone who doesnt side with him by recovering the last of the mortal instruments (the mirror).<br /><br />Downworlders and Shadowhunters will have to change their ways and work together to defeat Valentines army if they do not wish Valentine to rule them all.<br /><br />This book has the same intesnsity of the rest and more so because you see/feel the struggle between Jace and Clary trying to fight how they feel about each other and saving what's left of themselves.<br /><br />I would give this books more stars if i could, but i cant so 5 will do.
B0009A40ES|5.0|Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is your everyday Wall Street exec. He works for his fathers company, even though he doesn't really have to. He compares business cards with fellow friends and makes reservations at the newest and hottest restaurants... just because. He has a body every man wants and every girl wants to touch. He's meticulous and anal in everything he does. He's also a homicidal maniac. He kills for fun and he kills for release and he kills for hatred. After one of his murders though, a homicide cop begins too get a little too close for comfort of figuring out that Patrick could be the killer and Patrick begins to unravel from his calm demeanor.<br /><br />Never having read the book the movie is based on; I went into this movie blind. And loved it. It was a lot of fun to listen to his Patrick's narration of who he is and what he is. Like when he's talking about his facial mask. As he begins to peel it off after 10 minutes of having it on, you really just cant help see him telling us that what is on his outside is not who he is on the inside. He's not your friend. Not your coworker. Not your lover. He's a friggin soulless killer. It is crazy to think that someone could be so cold and emotionless, but yet there are people out there that are like that. I don't believe for a second that he got 100% pleasure out of all of his kills. Some seemed like he just couldn't help it. Like we might go get a massage, have sex, or just sit on the beach for some relaxation. He would kill.<br /><br />Not only is the movie just crazy good, it's also pretty funny. Dark funny though. Seeing him get massively pissed off over someone's business cards is too funny. And not in the ha-ha kind of funny way, but in the `holy crap he's getting pissed over nothing' kind of way. And flexing in the mirror while having sex with two girls? Legendary. And chasing someone down a hallway, butt nekid except for high tops, and a chainsaw? Once again... Legendary. And when he says things out loud such as \\"I'm into murders and executions\\" and someone doesn't really hear him and thinks he says `mergers and acquisitions'...that's just funny. There are just a lot of funny lines in this movie, but dark funny guys. I love how he tells people he will kill them, but you know he means it...lol.<br /><br />Christian Bale is a pretty good actor for sure. I love how he seems different in all his parts he plays. Not a lot different, but he just is. It's almost subtle, but he's not really ever the same. But one thing for sure is that good gracious God blessed that man with a crazy metabolism or something. I'm not gay, but the man has a great body. And to do what he does with it is crazy. I'll never forget the way he looked like a dang holocaust victim in The Mechanist and then like a few months later he was Batman or something. Crazy.<br /><br />P.S. - So I'm not afraid to say I don't understand the ending. I can't tell what was going on at the end. Is he a killer for real...or is it in his head? For instance...he blew up a cop car with a pistol. Even he looked at his gun like `wtf?' And then after his confession, even his lawyer said he was kidding around. Was he? Or was the lawyer covering for him? I was confused. Anyone want to help me out? I tried not to say much, so spoilers ahead if there needs to be in the comments!I'm into murders and executions\\" and someone doesn't really hear him and thinks he says `mergers and acquisitions'...that's just funny.

B000RHKARO|5.0|The effect of being on holidays in the USA is straight in your face right from the start.  The melting pot of the late sixties is here to hear and what a time it must have been   John Lee Hooker and Canned Heat are the blues influence here.  Canned Heat seemed to be pipped by their sound at times.  Eastern influences are given a run too.  Psychedelic sounds thrown in for good measure.   Hard rock is used and not just used to blow your ears to pieces, which nice to see for a change, mind you that first track does sound good cranked up.  The playing is first rate and still sounds fresh 40 years later.  You can clearly see why The Stones had their eyes on Mick Taylor and Peter Green was doing what Peter Green does play with style and class  If you haven't heard this record before, you really have know idea what you are missing.  This one, Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton and A Hard Road are my favorites.  The Bluesbreakers may have imploded or exploded which ever way you want to look at it and was John Mayall going to let it get him down NO WAY.  BTW who was Miss James, she must have made a big impression on Mayall !!!

0783233477|3.0|I'll make this sweet and to the point.    I had never seen this movie until yesterday. I had heard some of the hub-bub when it first came out, skipped the theater release and never got the DVD (back then still had a VHS). The film starts out as a 5-star movie but the last hour was just painful. Why? Death never reveals himself. I mean c'mon! Although beautiful, did we really need to see about half an hour's worth of \\"Susan's\\" face looking lost and forlorne. If I were directing I would have changed the script. Death er... I mean Brad... I mean Joe Black would have wacked Drew, mr. death would have revealed his true self in some funky ghostbusters way, and you would have seen the look of horror when Susan walks a little further and sees her dad's lifeless body. But instead, she is smitten by Pitten and walks off in the moonlight. Give me a break. Death takes a holiday alright.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|There is definitely a Timbaland influence in the music, but Chris' vocals are still present and very strong.  An unusual departure but definitely in my playlist.  There isn't one song that I disliked.  Personal favorites: Time, Ground Zero and Part of Me.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Frankly, I am amazed that the reviews for this exceptional movie version of F. Scott Fitzergerald's masterpiece novel didn't receive 5 stars across the board.  The movie depicted his story so well, not like so many where I've had to say: \\"The book was a lot better than the movie.\\"  In this case, however, the movie actually enhanced the book's greatness.  Robert Redford, Mia Farrow, Lois Chiles, Bruce Dern, Karen Black & Scott Wilson were at their best acting performance and Sam Waterson was ideal as narrator.  What more can I say? Perfect casting!  Perfect settings! Perfect musical score!  The costumes & dress were especially appropriate for the time period making me feel like I was right there among those reveling in the glory of the glamorous roaring 20s.  Oh, to have another great movie like this come out in today's world where unfortunately, explicit sex and gross language are the norm.
B001MYIXAC|1.0|I too bought this film from amazon and wish that Magnolia had disclosed a change in the subtitles from original release of the film.  This change completely worsens a great foreign film.    Buyers beware of this problem with the release.  Hopefully we can expect Magnolia to own up to their decision and replace what i consider defective copies.    MY thoughts echo another commenter:    Unbelievable. Just read the comment saying that they WILL REISSUE the disc but that they WILL NOT HAVE AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM for those who purchased their DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. So let me get this straight; those of us who love this film, preordered it, then pointed out their mistake, thereby saving others from a mutilated film end up being PUNISHED because of it? Magnolia, you're a real class act.
B001MYIXAW|1.0|Do not buy this movie yet.  Magnolia butchered the subtitles and will be releasing a version with the theatrical subtitles in the near future.  Magnolia will not replace this disc with the fixed one, so hold off on your purchase.

B001G9F9IW|4.0|Woody Allen has never made a secret of Ingmar Bergman's influence on his work.  VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA is very Bergman-esque, but it also somehow remains distinctly Woody Allen.  The great script once again proves, as so many Woody Allen films do, that the story is the cornerstone of any good film, and the great acting adds the crowning touch.  Visually, the blu ray version is stunning.

B00007BKVC|5.0|1991 was an amazing year for movies; everything from \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" to \\"The Prince of Tides\\" entertained audiences, but that year one film became a true classic-a film many regard as one of Hollywood's best-\\"Thelma and Louise\\".<br /> Written by Callie Khourie, who recieved an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, \\"Thelma and Louise\\" tells the tale of two best friends who go to the mountains for a weekend getaway, but a stop at a roadside bar changes their plans and lives forever. Escaping the police, Thelma and Louise encounter many characters on their cross-country journey, as they head to Mexico and a new life. Heavily regarded as one of the best buddy films ever made, the film is really a woman's picture, telling the story of how women are just as good as men, and how men can be arrogant, pompous, and abusive toward their female counterparts. I love this film.<br /> Brad Pitt had his first mainstream role in this, and both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis received Oscar nods for their performances.<br /> The DVD is filled with bonuses; there's four documentaries on the movie, audio commentaries with director Ridley Scott, the two stars, and the writer, and the treasure here are 30 minutes of newly discovered deleted scenes found by the studio.<br /> A wonderful comedy/drama, \\"Thelma and Louise\\" never ages...it gets better as the years go by. An ageless film in every sense.

B001PPLIFU|4.0|I need to address something that seems to confuse people. It seems the lack of super secret weapons, ice castles, and James Bond being more suave than gritty annoys people. Well, after 50 years of the same thing I am superiorly happy to have the reboot of the Bond series continue in this newer, grittier, more true to the books version.    I will agree that for action direction, Quantum Of Solace does fall into the one a second, jump edit, who the heck knows what's going on, school. It's annoying... very annoying. However on the smaller screen at home it's possible to follow what's happening. On the big screen at the theater... not possible. Seeing the whole frame at once just helps, a lot. After the first couple sequences (car chase and rooftop scramble), the action settles down even more and it's possible to understand what's happening.    I love this movie. The writing is so smart. A real villain, a real goal that's attainable (controlling a country by controlling it's water), and actual (God forbid) spying! Somewhere starting with Timothy Dalton I think, the concept of being a spy was only mentioned in Bond movies. In Quantum of Solace, Bond actually runs around SPYING!!! It's something that had been sorely missing for so long.    Most people have addressed the contents of the plot so I want to end discussing how brutal Bond is and the famous shot down the barrel at the end of QOS instead of at the beginning. I've read people call it \\"dumb\\" to have it at the end. Well, they are dumb. It's a brilliant move and here's why. The producers started completely over with Bond. COMPLETELY OVER. Like from the ground up. Casino Royale is an origin story. And after watching QOS, I understood that it's the conclusion of the origin story started in Casino Royale. The concept is that the Bond we all know from the past started somewhere. You're not a cold hearted s.o.b. for no reason. Kudos to the production team for taking their time. They wanted two movies to tell the origin and they took two movies. Two exciting and thrilling movies. By the time QOS ends, the Vesper story is tied off. All the people Bond cares about die around him. It's basically showing how and why he became so hardened and callous. It's a defense mechanism. And now that the origin story is complete with the end of the film, the producers stick the gun barrel shot to signify that the real fun is about to begin. It's saying \\"hey - you've always known Bond, the suave guy, after this point. So now that we have told you his origin, we can get on to the rest of his story, the one you're more familiar with.\\" It's not signifying the end of QOS, it's signifying the beginning of Bond. It's a brilliant move, most likely chosen well in advance, and shows tremendous patience.    Cause really - if you're going to start over, do it right. And I think these past two movies combine to really do it right. Let's face it, be honest, Bond had totally lost his way. Die Another Day is fun, but really silly. Para-sailing in front of a glacier melted by a death ray? Come on. And if we are being really, truly honest, most Bond films do not stand the test of time and are not that great. Quantum of Solace continues the trend of substance over style. Where style is defined by quality, not gadgets and stupid one liners.     Hooray for Quantum of Solace. Flawed, yes. The action is poorly edited and the exploding hotel at the end is, well, an exploding hotel. But overall, smart concepts, smart dialog, grounded and believable acting (tell me you didn't think Greene was really creepy even if nerdy), and a story that fits within the realm of possibility.    I'll be there for the next one for sure.

B00026ZG10|5.0|This movie has it all--action, humor, romance, intrigue.  Tom Arnold is hilarious and Jamie Lee Curtis is superb.  A great movie to watch with beer and pizza.
B001EO748M|5.0|[[ASIN:B000P12LWY The Tudors - The Complete First Season]]    My neighbor said this was a MUST see and lent us her copy -- once we watched it...we were hooked.  BEST and most informative portrayal of not just the TUDOR period, but the real life characters who literally CHANGED the world -- not just political but the very foundation of Christianity and the Catholic church.  Mesmerizing from the first scene...  If you are a real history buff, both of politics and people, I highly recommend checking TAG suggestions below...they in themselves I found a valueable history lesson and resource.
044024367X|3.0|I read it.  It just wasn't of the same quality the other Lee Child books are.  I found it hard to get into Jack's desire to keep going back into a hideous town like Despair after such a big deal was made out of how he doesn't, really doesn't, like to back track.  After we got over that the middle of the book was pretty good, but the end became...more than a bit over-the-top.  So, the first and last quarters of the book were IMO, about two star, and the middle was about four stars, so that would average to about three, right?
B0000AM6IY|5.0|[[ASIN:B0000AM6IY West Side Story (Full Screen Edition)]]    A great upgrade version to replace your old VHS tape of this classic Broadway (movie version) musical.  I like this DVD version of the available ones best because it is FULL SCREEN (great for us that don't have the new BIG screens).
B001QB9H10|2.0|\\"You are the gay\\"?  Come on, really?  I was unaware, but apparently this question is fairly prevelent in Transporter discussion.  I thought the lack of love interests was because it wasn't a necessary plot devise.  After watching this film, not only is it not a necessity, but it destroys the film.<br /><br />Great action, great Statham, the best villain of the franchise, but I almost fell asleep watching the \\"love scene\\" between Frank and Freckles.  I couldn't tell the difference between her bored, her excited, her high, her scared, and her horny because she sounded exactly the same, mono-toned throughout.  Statham actually looked bored while she was \\"seducing\\" him.  She was the only low point for the film, but she was in it way too much for it to still be enjoyable.  I hope this doesn't ruin the series, and I really hope Robert Knepper's career isn't affected.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|In my opinion, this how the PS3 controller should have been constructed.  The triggers fit snug and don't fall off.  The material and color match the controller perfectly.
B001N18HO6|5.0|Don't let it bother you that the \\"Drop in the Park\\" is just on vinyl.  Inside there is a code that you can redeem to download the concert on mp3.  Very nice!
B00004TR2G|3.0|Now, I am sure I am gonna get pounded by everybody for what I am about to say but this is what I think of it.  First off, I love the fact that we got the actual cues heard in the film.  That I have no problem with.  I recently did a side by side comparison of this and the original album and concluded that the original 34 minute album is the best listening experience. There are 2 reasons for this.    1. At 51 minutes, listening to the complete version is difficult because it is not the most melodically pleasant of John William's scores though he certainly deserved the oscar for it.  It works better in the film overall than it does on a cd at 51 minutes.  The original album wins out because at 34 minutes it is just the right length even though it is still not the most pleasant thing to listen to either.      2. This complete version sounds worse than the original album.  Yes, worse.  Why?  The reason is because it was no-noised to death.  Using noise reduction to this extent kills a recording.  It literally sucks the life out of it.  I would rather hear the cues with the background hiss than a recording that has been treated in this way.  I know they used a no-noise program because it says so in the booklet. There are ways to do it right but it should be minimal.  This was just too much for me.      Ok, so there ya have it.  Based on those 2 criteria alone, the original album wins.  Sonically, that original album was not no-noised to death.  It sounds richer and warmer.  This complete album is just so darned quiet that I even question the EQ choices made but that is for another review.  Anyway I love having it for the film cues but based on production and the best overall pleasant listening experience, the award goes to the original 1975 album.  John Williams is awesome!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|We have throughly enjoyed the movie \\"Miss Potter\\".  It spured our interest in Beatrix Potter and we have since ordered four books about her and her stories.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Well written and has some very important moral lessons.  I felt pulled into the story from the start and the action was well paced.  I enjoyed the romance and love shown between the protagonist and her fiance and his family.  There is also some nice clean humor which makes reading this book even more pleasurable.  This is a book I would not be ashamed to admit that I have read this book and readily recommend it to any who enjoy romance and action.
B001N18HOQ|4.0|I liked what they did with the remix on the original album, especially the slower songs like Garden and Black, but I think Jeremy as well as Breath and SOLAT were slowed down too much.  2,000 mile blues has a cool vibe to it-very Doors like.  Should have left evil little goat off.  I've always liked the live feel of Pearl Jam's music and think they should have stuck to that formula a bit more.  The Porch remix had more energy to it.  Overall, I'd say this is more for the hardcore fan but I would pick up a live concert over this.
B001O03NCW|4.0|When I heard about this movie it peaked my interest, but what helped make the movie truly great was the old timie music. Without it would not have been nearly as authentic. I grew up hearing some of this type music when I went to church socials in the country with my grandmother as a young child. With the acting of George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman, and Holly Hunter and the incredible costumes and sets it was like taking a trip in time. Excellent movie and CD. The CD has a nice mix of blues and upbeat songs that should suit most ecclectic tastes. The standouts include \\"I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow\\", \\"Down In The River To Pray\\", \\"O Death \\", and \\"In The Jailhouse Now\\". Well worth owning if you like blues, bluegrass, gospel, traditional country, and folk music. I never get tired of the movie or the music. Excellent quality CD with plenty of replayability.<br /><br />CA Luster
0385340990|5.0|I just finished reading this book about 3 minutes ago. Over too soon! I admit, it was a few pages before I got used to the letter style, it does somewhat confuse and seem disjointed, but as I did, I became more and more involved in this novel and couldn't put it down.  It was like these characters were very real people and I wanted to know them personally, become friends with them.<br /><br />I am so enormously impressed with this book that I immediately went to the internet to search for contact info for the author so that I might beg for a sequel. I must know ************************ successfully!  How the book about ***************** finally turned out! I want to know if ************************* have more children!  And I absolutely must know if Isola does actually race her motorcycle!  Then I saw the memorial page for Mary Ann Shaffer and my heart dropped. What a horrible loss. I began tearing up, knowing her loss was possibly the loss of all these wonderful & eccentric people.  I hope Annie Barrows might be persuaded to pick up the torch and keep it burning?<br /><br />This novel had me laughing as well as crying.  Such a delicate weaving of joy and tragedy.  It truly can't end here, there is so much more these characters can offer! Once you immerse yourself in the style of the writing you can connect with each character in such a way that isn't always readily available in other fiction.  In a way, the fact that it was fiction fell away.  This novel shares tragedy and horror alongside incredible hope.  It is not difficult to imagine Guernsey or to see the homes and landscape in your mind's eye.<br /><br />I was torn about giving this novel a rating of 4 or 5 due to the disjointed and slow beginning. Truth be told, I almost put this novel down because of it. But it absolutely picked up and I am so glad I didn't give up. In the end, my desire for MORE of these characters has bumped my rating to a 5.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I have purchased this DVD because I found it beautiful as a story and of course the music.  Looking for your real parents from a child's point of view is a lifetime achievement.This story could very well be a real story that some children experienced in their own lives.The genius part of it though,is a little bit more difficult.we are not in the Renaissance period where artist,composers,painters,scientist,astrologers,are born.In my opinion there are very few geniuses in our mist today.  Sad,however looking at this movie you get inspired to listen to sounds around you,to be hopeful for the future,and to keep dreaming that dreams can and do come true.Be it in finding what you want and accomplishing your goal.
B001990LNW|4.0|Why end the show? Can't it last till Season 9 like SG-1? (And it's so much better than SG-1.) If the producers or TV networks are concerned about its profitability, I suggest they run Seasons 1-3 on TV again, but with SUBTITLES this time. Give it a chance! I'm sure it will generate huge viewership (like Buffy) that it can go even for 10 seasons. Seasons 1-3 are really the best! I don't remember having watched anything better.   I think everyone would agree that we watched this show because it was fun! That was mostly lost in Season 4. In Seasons 1-3, many complained about the main cast: wanting more development for Teyla, Ronon being a \\"wooden\\" actor, Weir not being an appealing leader. Well, the directors listened to them and made BAADD decisions to accommodate them. They killed off Dr. Weir, even the good Dr. Beckett! Then they made the story \\"darker\\", the future \\"bleak\\". That's why we lost some of the sense of \\"fun\\" in Seasons 4 & 5.    1st, I'd like to clarify to the directors: Though we like the thrill of having a character be in grave danger, we don't really want them killed! SG-1 became a favorite because they kept their main cast till the end. (Same with Buffy.) In Season 3, when the Atlantis cast were just starting to \\"gel\\", the directors chose to change them over ...and over. When something is already good, just stick with it. Don't mess with what's already great. If you need more storylines, just give the characters more background, to give them more depth. We loved it when we learned that McKay had a sister and when Sheppard went to his dad's funeral.  In Season 4, Dr. Keller became the chief doctor, and so began the downhill trend of Season 4, because she cannot seem to solve anything. Thankfully, in Season 5 they chose to match her with one of the main characters in the show. (She's really good in such roles. She played her role well as a pining admirer and gifted mechanic in \\"Firefly\\".) Then they brought Dr. Beckett back again to accomplish the brilliant solutions (which we expect from him) to save the day.  When Dr. Weir went missing, they replaced her with military personnel, and it was like a choke-hold was put on Atlantis. One of the main reasons SG-Atlantis is better than SG-1 is because the group is out of the direct control of the military, and a female (meaning more compassionate and principled) is making the main decisions. They can get away with not following protocols because they are doing \\"what's right\\". If the networks or producers continue the show, I hope they get a civilian leader again who is also female so she can play off against both Sheppard and McKay. Or bring back Dr. Weir?  Also, I have to say that because reviews keep on mentioning how we love McKay, that doesn't mean we don't like Sheppard. The Colonel is cute, endearing, very intelligent and even funny. We need his kind of personality, his \\"do-it-now\\" ideas and actions in the many crises they faced.  We like both of them. Don't bring down one or the other. Though McKay is really something special; he made his character so interesting that he stole the show (like Michael Fox did with Family Ties).   Then there's Teyla. Thankfully, they did not pair her with any one in the team. Sheppard and Ronon needed a friend, and she is a great friend to both. We liked it when her role was expanded to using her ability as a significant tactic in the fight with the Wraith. But it was overplayed when she went undercover as a Queen. The writers should know when not to heed the critics. Her small stature made that episode absurd, and it's embarrassing to make her play that role. A Queen is supposed to be tall and strong. (They are going to bear the next generation of Wraiths after all.) The idea of Teyla having a family of her own is wonderful. If only her husband is a tribal chieftain, someone her equal, not a heavy baggage which she should not have had at all. And Ronon, whatever others may say, is a necessary part of the show. When he joined the team, that's when we felt secure that they can have a confrontation with the Wraiths. What's more, that's also the time when the show really reached its peak; and we can see the actors also enjoying while acting in their roles.   We watched Seasons 1-3 again during Christmas vacations 2008, and found the stories as entertaining. It was such great fun!
1416914307|4.0|Although my expectations were too high for City of Bones, I have to say that the series has gotten better with every book, leading to a very satisfying City of Glass read. Questions get answered; plot points get tied up, and you're left with a happy fuzzy feeling in the end.    I really enjoyed the characters in the books, especially CoG. Each character has really come a long way, and even when I disagreed with a character, I felt that they were completely within character; their personalities drove the plot, rather than a having series of random events they were just responding to. I also love that - with a few exceptions (Malachi, Sebastian) - they were all so multidimensional, shades of gray in a morally ambiguous world.     On Jace and Clary - I'd give this a 4/5, mainly because I've always felt a little awkward about their relationship, and it's not just the sibling thing. There were some beautiful and heartbreaking moments - again, back to characterization, I was definitely thinking \\"That's so Jace!\\" sometimes - but I also got the feeling that their relationship was unnecessarily drawn out. Maybe it's because I never got a good sense of Clary's relationship to the Lightwoods (early on, Clary saying to Isabelle, \\"But I thought you liked me!\\" and then later confronting Isabelle about not liking her, for example). But even though I'm happy with how things ended up, I think Clary and Jace really shined brighter when they were apart in this book, than in their scenes together.    On the other hand, some of the \\"minor\\" characters were wonderful. Alec and Magnus are a riot (\\"Your city is under attack...The wards have broken, and the streets are full of demons. And you want to know why I haven't called you?\\"). Aldertree reminded me of Umbridge. Simon grows up, while still maintaining his nerdiness.     I was not as fond of the thematic progress of the book, possibly because I'm re-reading Harry Potter right now and it seems so familiar, and the same ideas are in almost every fantasy book. You are the sum of your actions, not of your birth. Do what is right, and not what is easy. Villians always end up defeated because they just had to show off, and forgot some key thing. People are never who they say they are, and never trust a death to be final.    So I tend to be an impatient reader, and this might just be my fault, but I also found that skipping pages in the book didn't really make me miss much. You'll get the whole story just from reading Joceyln's talk with Clary and then the last chapter. The middle of the book was great, with some great moments, but I didn't feel the same compunction to read every word, the way I do with some other books.    Overall, even with my negative points, I'm really happy with this book. You'll laugh (Cassie has some great lines, and I'm a fan of anything nerdy). You'll be frustrated with the characters. Sometimes, you'll wonder why you didn't think of it first. In the end, this book delivers a very satisfying read - I'd imagine it sort of tastes like butterbeer.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|The distributor must have been inundated with complaints about the bad subtitling, and have issued a statement that new pressings from today on will have the orignal theatrical English subtitles. Info from thedigitalbits.com:    [...]    In other news today, you might recall that we recently reviewed Magnet's Let the Right One In on Blu-ray Disc. Well, it's just come to our attention that the DVD and Blu-ray versions have English subtitles that differ substantially from those of the theatrical art house presentation, in that much of the subtle nuance has been lost and many original lines of dialogue are untranslated entirely. Unfortunately, having only seen the film once in theatres, I wasn't familiar enough with the translation to spot the differences. But Icons of Fright has posted some examples of just how different the subtitles are. We contacted Magnet directly on this issue this afternoon, and they were quick to respond as follows:     \\"We've been made aware that there are several fans that don't like the version of the subtitles on the DVD/BR. We had an alternate translation that we went with. Obviously a lot of fans thought we should have stuck with the original theatrical version. We are listening to the fans feedback, and going forward we will be manufacturing the discs with the subtitles from the theatrical version.\\"     We asked Magnet some follow-up questions, specifically how people will be able to identify the new discs, when they'll be available in stores and if there will be an exchange program for those who have the existing version. Here's what they said:     \\"There are no exchanges. We are going to make an alternate version available however. For those that wish to purchase a version with the theatrical subtitles, it will be called out in the tech specs box at the back/bottom of the package where it will list SUBTITLES: ENGLISH (Theatrical), SPANISH.\\"     The no exchange thing is going to upset many that have already purchased the disc, and understandably so. We're at least encouraged to see that the title is being corrected. We'll let you know when the discs are available, and rest assured we're letting Magnet know that an exchange program might be a wise idea...
B0009A41WE|5.0|This is an outstanding complete cycle of Beethoven's Piano Concertos. I ordered it after being very disappointed with the Brendel/Rattle set (from which I expected great things being a great admirer of both) and this Uchida/Sanderling set was a revelation. Uchida's more recent recordings of the late Piano Sonatas have proved her to be a very fine interpreter of Beethoven, winning almost universal praise, and this re-issue of her earlier ventures into Beethoven shows that she is very, very good in the concertos as well.<br /><br />As with her excellent Mozart concertos, one of Uchida's great strengths is her restraint and refusal to resort to the sort of techniques which are intended to draw attention to the brilliance of the soloist and which (in my view, anyway) distract from the brilliance of the music. It isn't that she is cold or uninvolved - very far from it - but she uses her virtuosity to the service of Beethoven, not to the service of Uchida, and the result is magnificent music-making. She (as always) has a lovely tone and her technique is impeccable which makes the slower movements truly affecting and really memorable (the Adagio of the Emperor Concerto is stunning), and she has the power to give it some real welly when needed without it ever feeling forced or harsh.<br /><br />Sanderling and the two orchestras he conducts on the set are also outstanding, with a real feel for both the music and for Uchida's playing; the partnership is a joy. The whole thing is a real tour de force from start to finish and I'm surprised that this cycle isn't better known - I think it knocks spots off several more celebrated sets. Furthermore it's an amazing bargain.<br /><br />Experienced Beethoven listeners will all have their individual favourites playing each of the concertos, of course, and not everyone will like every concerto here as much as I do, but if you're looking for a really good complete cycle you have very little to lose and a wonderful musical experience to gain with this set and I recommend it very warmly indeed.ain with this set and I recommend it very warmly indeed.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I hope everyone gets a chance to see Mamma Mia...with the hard times we are having now this movie is really uplifting!  Watch this movie and you will come out smiling and singing.  The cast is perfect!  Meryl Streep leads this cast of winners! As always, Meryl pulls you in!  She is a classic.  The rest of the cast is perfect also...Julie, Christine, Pierce, Colin, Amanda, Dominic, Stellan...they make you sing and dance and laugh and feel good!  What a fun movie! The music of ABBA is terrific and boy can these people sing ABBA's songs in this movie. This is a movie you don't want to miss!
B000MG1ZG0|4.0|\\"Morrison Hotel/Hard Rock Cafe\\" was the first Doors album I bought, and I was struck by how different it sounded from its predecessors.  Rather than psychedelic blues and haunting, sensuous dark melodies, \\"Morrison Hotel\\" is straight-up hard rock and blues.  This album was partly a response to criticism of the gradual softening of the group's sound that climaxed with \\"The Soft Parade.\\"    The Doors immediately re-establish their power with the opener, \\"Roadhouse Blues.\\"  One of their greatest tracks ever, it features Ray Manzarek on banging piano, Robby Krieger dishing out staccato guitar licks, and guest John Sebastian kicking in with country/blues harmonica.  Jim Morrison sings about an L.A. roadhouse and bungalows, meals, and beer:  \\"Keep your eyes on the road and your hands upon the wheel.\\" Jim is autobiographical, too: \\"The future's uncertain, the end is always near.\\"     The first part of \\"Peace Frog/Blue Sunday,\\" the next-strongest entry, is about \\"blood in the streets,\\" with reference to Jim's New Haven bust, but also \\"phantastic LA.\\" Complemented by a single funky motif, Jim's lyrics are peppered with strong visual images, and again self-realization: \\"blood on the rise, it's following me.\\" Robby contributes a great solo, and Jim makes his famous reference to his childhood car-crash experience: \\"Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding/ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.\\"  Also top notch is \\"Ship of Fools,\\" a smooth rocker in which Ray gets in a good solo and Jim's commentary remains primarily negative.      \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" finally makes it onto a Doors' LP after a two-album delay, with strong riffs and Jim's dramatic singing. The opening signature/motif to \\"You Make Me Real\\" is an only slightly altered version of that of \\"Twentieth Century Fox,\\" but the songs sound far different.  With Ray's \\"Screaming Ray Daniels\\" piano, The Doors sound like black artists here more than on any of their songs.  This completes vinyl LP Side 1, or\\"Hard Rock Café,\\" which the restaurant chain scooped up.     The second half, \\"Morrison Hotel,\\" is weaker than \\"Hard Rock Café,\\" pulled down by its forgettable closer \\"Maggie McGill.\\"  The best track, \\"Queen of the Highway,\\" concerns Jim's love interest Pamela Courson and mixes in things like midnight whirlpools and images of Americana. Robby leads a good instrumental charge, but the song structure is akin to spoken-word.  Jim's \\"The Spy\\" is decent but uninteresting cocktail lounge music in which Jim's \\"eyes have seen you\\" again. \\"Land Ho\\" is a fair sea shanty, but one of the least Doors'-like songs the group ever recorded.  Finally, \\"Indian Summer\\" is a beautiful slow ballad, but short and repetitive.    Lyrically \\"Morrison Hotel\\" is very strong, very American, and very autobiographical for Jim.  That helps make it acceptable to those who may have expected a more Doors-like sound but didn't get it.  I kept the faith, and eventually, \\"Morrison Hotel\\" grew on me.    Bonus tracks:  There is a substantial amount of bonus material, including an alternate version of \\"The Spy,\\" which is really good.  The choppy \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" entries, both fragmented and extended, will interest those who like the song, and yours truly is one.  Still, the total amount of time spent makes me feel chugged out.   Other material is mostly false starts and cut-outs.

In fact, I could no longer take the suspense so I bought & read the book.  The book is slightly different but both book & show are equally fantastic.  I've read all the books and can't wait for book 9.  Can't wait for season 2 either.  And even though I have this series saved on my tivo, I can't wait to buy it on DVD.  Thank you Alan Ball & HBO!  Best show ever. Seriously.
B000QEILLK|3.0|I know I'm gonna get flamed but, ya' know, too bad. I had never even heard of the Flower Kings until they were recommended to me. I was told \\"As good as Yes or Pink Floyd, or Rush\\". I was stoaked and ready to hear me some Flower Kings. I thought why not get a greatest hits and that way I can hear all the good stuff I've supposedly missed. This being a 2 CD set I put in the first CD and waited to be amazed, The first 8 songs were very, very good. Roine Stolt is an excellent guitar player and the other musicians were up to the task as his equals on their chosen instruments. Starting with track 9 it all went downhill fast. \\"This is the new Rush, or Yes or Pink Floyd ?\\" I asked myself. Not even on the same planet!! I thought disc 2 might be better. Wrong again....(see where this is going?) The only decent songs on disc 2 were Touch My Heaven and Life Will Kill You and this only because of the level of musicianship. All the rest of the songs sounded like old 60's flower power love songs. You remember The Cowsills, Harpers Bizarre, etc. etc. I half expected little butterflies to come winging there way out of the stereo and flowers to drop from the ceiling. This stuff was mush!!<br />  If they are the next Pink Floyd or Yes, we're in trouble. I gave this collection 3 stars but only for Stolt's guitar work. He is truly amazing.<br />If someone can tell me which of their albums are MUCH MUCH better than this one, I'll give them a listen but if this truly is their best.....don't bother.
B001N18HOQ|4.0|I was not real happy about the idea of a remix.  I did not care for the remixes that were on their best of released a few years back. If it ain't broke why fix it? I have to say that it's much better than expected.  I can hardly tell a difference.  The songs don't seem changed as much as they are just more crisp and fresh.  The only reason I don't give this 5 stars if because they left off the b-sides from that era.  If this contained Wash and Yellow Ledbetter and the rest of the b-sides plus Breathe and State of Love and Trust from Singles it would be amazing.

B001BNFR6W|1.0|I ordered this DVD series set on March 6, 2009 and when it arrived, I found that several of the discs would skip episodes and that the quality of other episodes were very choppy and pixilated.  I returned the original set to amazon.com with a prepaid label from UPS, only to receive a replacement set that had the same problems.  A representative from amazon.com stated that the series would be rendered unavailable to order until it was determined whether or not amazon.com had received a bad lot of the Will & Grace series.  Upon observing the site since my correspondence with representatives from amazon.com, I see that that has not happened.  All I can say to any potential buyers is BEWARE!!
B00123B9TU|5.0|I'm afraid I'm in a bit of a minority here when it comes to many fans, according to my browsing of Rush related discussion boards, but I love Counterparts. Even those who also enjoy the album will probably agree that I love it more than it's worth, but that's ok too. The interesting thing is that when I list out all the greatest Rush songs ever, few would come from this album. And yet, it remains to me one of Rush's most consistent and wholly satisfying collection of songs as a group; a no-name assortment of vagabonds that get little individual attention, yet still deliver.    Counterparts made a statement to me, although I wasn't in-the-moment to appreciate that change back in 1993. Still, even looking back now it's difficult not to hear a return to attitude and get a sense of the band re-focusing and simplifying itself, stripping away a lot of the layers and getting back to more of a straight-forward three-piece sound. Gone were the textures of Power Windows and Hold Your Fire; fading was the softer lush of Presto and Roll The Bones. Counterparts found the band approaching a new album with louder guitars, more riffs, and a dryer, more upfront sound.     To be blunt, it was refreshingly in-your-face.    Another area where I seem to stand in contrast to many Rush fans is that I think it's one of Rush's strongest lyrical albums. Some folks seem to prefer that Neil write about anything but love...that that's not his strong suit, but this album about relationships I find to be incredibly concise and poignant. Not every allusion works. For instance, in the song Alien Shore there's some awkwardness. The \\"we elect each other President\\" line is weak and really doesn't mean anything to me. But in most cases he strikes to the core of some really personal issues and does it with style and pointed grace. Cold Fire and Nobody's Hero are great examples of this. The former is arguably one of Peart's finest lyrics ever, adopting a stance from each side of relationship with profound lyrical clarity. Also kudos to Peart for seamlessly using \\"phosphorescent\\" in a song. Hero often gets guffaws and immature ridicule for its metrosexual exclamation in the song's opening lines, yet the tune has a wonderful message about both acceptance and what type of person comprises the backbone of society; the song easily outclassing its criticism.     Musically speaking Counterparts is a fun ride. The songs are clearly heavier this time around. Some of the more cynical fans have dismissed the guitars as generic metal-alternative riffola, but at least Lifeson is playing more than just shimmering accents to keyboard riffs again for the first time on nearly a full record since perhaps Moving Pictures twelve years earlier. On Counterparts Alex steps to the plate as something more than the third member of Rush. Songs like Animate chug along at wrist-snapping pace and the cheeky Stick It Out belts your mouth with some fine axe work, as does the rumble and purr of Cut To The Chase. Double Agent is the idiosyncratic song, with its oddly-whispered center lyric over Lifeson's frantic riffing and Peart's persistently growling toms.     That's not to imply that recent Rush is gone from the picture, though. Everyday Glory settles right into what Rush had been doing over the past four years quite nicely with its triumphant and bombastic chorus and anthemic sound. Like with Roll The Bones, Rush takes a stab at another instrumental as well, this time rendering their previous record's effort utterly forgettable in its wake. Leave That Thing Alone is well-seated in the pantheon of the great Rush instrumentals, focusing less on keyboards and getting back to a funky bass-driven sound that marks their best vocal-less effort between 1981 and 2007.     I don't have too much negative to say about this record, which in some ways is unfortunate because reviews are often best when they're scathing and sarcastic. Sadly I don't have much of that on tap for Counterparts. The album's not perfect. Not every song is a ten and in fact, few, if any , are as it turns out. But they're all a solid group of 8-to-8.5s or higher in my estimation, and that goes back to why I value this recording so much; it's keenly consistent. Songs like Alien Shore and The Speed Of Love are often the subject of ridicule and while they might technically be on the more blasé side of Counterparts than some of the other songs, they're far and above their...wait for it...counterparts on the most recent previous albums, rising well above the likes of Hand Over Fist and Face Up. In other words, I find none of the songs here even remotely qualify as bad. On Counterparts I don't just tolerate the worst songs, I actually like them.     Tonally speaking I love this record. It marks the return of Peter Collins after a six-year absence, but he's less evident here than on the audio tapestries of Power Windows or Hold Your Fire. With Counterparts you get more of a sense of engineer Kevin Shirley's input and I like the results. I got to know his later production work with Iron Maiden and Journey before enjoying Counterparts after-the-fact, so I was already familiar with Shirley's dry and upfront mixes. I'm not an audiophile and more attuned people than I can go on about his work, their disdain over his compression, etc. but I wish the band had kept Shirley around for a few more albums.     In every understated way, Counterparts is a keeper and their Cadillac of the 1990s. While it will never carry the weight of mighty prog gargantuans like Hemispheres or 2112, nor did it ever even touch the godlike feet of Moving Pictures in terms of popularity and impact, Counterparts remains Rush's sleeping giant.    Nobody's hero indeed.    COUNTERPARTS: 5 stars of 5 (-)
B000MQ54OY|5.0|I THOUGHT IT WAS AMAZING HOW THEY COULD GET TAP DANCING AND SYNC IT WITH COMPUTER AMIMATION!  AWESOME STORY TOO!
B001N18HO6|1.0|OK, for starters, I love Pearl Jam. And out of their discography, this is (by far) my favorite album. This album is desert island music. I love that they release every live show. I am not a die hard fan (some studio efforts miss the mark, but I am always impressed with their creativity).    So, overall, I was excited about what was possible with this project.    That said, I always get nervous when I hear about these overblown ultradeluxe items, because it almost always ends up being overpriced junk.    Seeing the results of this project just makes me shake my head in complete disappointment about what could have been, and the epic fail it has become.    But, let's take things one at a time.    1) Remastered album: Always a great idea. 5 stars.     2) Re-edited album. Interesting concept, but I don't get it. This album is a classic and needs no messing with. I have no problem with a variety of different edits (long songs getting a sharter radio edit, having a live or accostic version etc). But I never heard anyone clamoring for a re-mix. That said, it sounds OK. But, this really is something that is for the hardcore fans. Casual listeners could care less about this. So, putting this in every version of this release seems unusual. This should have been limited to the ultra-box set (IMO)    3) 6 extra rare and/or live tracks. Wonderful-this is what sets like this should be about-old demos, b-sides, tracks that didn't quite make the album, and other rarities.    4) Unplugged. This was massively overdue. And a huge addition to the discography. But, why just a DVD? These unplugged concerts make for a great live CD. I will watch the DVD a few times, but a CD would have been played endlessly. This should have been released in both formats.    5) Vinyl. Pearl Jam loves their vinyl. And it is certainly making a comeback. I really don't have good memories about this format (igrew up with it, and it is rather cumbersome, and I dislike the background hiss it gives). But, if some people like it, then I appreciate PJ issuing it and giving their fans a choice.    6) Momma-Son cassette. Out of all the reproductions in this box, this is the most interesting. That said, I don't even HAVE a cassette player anymore. Kudo's for the cool trinket, but the 3 tracks could have been included on one of the CDs (somewhere) so that it could be easily listened to.    7) Book, photos, and various other reproductions. This is the type of stuff that makes me cringe. Yes, it is interesting to see. But these are all reproductions. Books like this routinely sell for under $20 (and typically end up in a bargin bin for under $10). But, when they are included in a set like this, they try to spin it as the holy grail for PJ fans to justify the insane MSRP. Yeah, it's nice to flip through, but it will then go on a shelf never to be looked at again. Ultra-deluxe versions of movies and CD's always comes packed with these large usuless trinkets to try to lure collectors and fans.I have been suckered before and I always get a sick feeling in my stomach for having wasted my money. Useless junk.    8) Drop in the park. Great hearing a early PJ concert (since these early concerts were before they started releasing every live show). But, vinyl only??? What the hell???? I do not like that format and I do not own a turntable. You don't even give me a choice???? What the hell are they thinking?????    OK, now let's look at the different format's available with this release:    1) Basic. Remastered album. Re-edited album. 6 bonus tracks.  Opinion: Don't see the need for having both edits one here. This is for the casual fan. This release should replace the old version. Just release the remastered version (with or without the bonus tracks). Keep it simple.    2) Deluxe. Remastered CD, Re-edited CD. 6 bonus tracks. Pearl Jam Unplugged DVD. Expanded booklet.  Opinion: Probably the best release of the 4. But I still believe that the Re-edit is something only hardcore fans will really want. I also think a CD and DVD of Unplugged would have been called for here. If they did that, this would have been a great release.    3) Vinyl. Kudos for giving the option. I can see having the re-mixed album here since vinyl releases attract more the serious music fan.    4) Ultra Deluxe. This is where everything stops making sense. You get a CD and Vinyl version of the original album and the re-mix (why do you need 2 formats in the same box). You get all the trinkets, Unplugged (still DVD only),  Momma-son tape (good addition, but the tracks should have been on a CD somewhere) and you get Drop in the Park on Vinyl only. C'mon. This doesn't make sense. 2 formats in one package is mindboggling. Omitting CD versions of 2 concerts and a demo tape is equally inexcusible. And all it does is inflate the price.    This ultra-deluxe should have had 2 versions: CD and Vinyl. They should NOT have both been in the same box. Each set should have included the following:  1) Remastered album  2) Re-edited album (in this edition only)  3) Unplugged CD or Vinyl  4) Unplugged DVD  5) Drop in the Park CD or Vinyl  6) 6 Bonus tracks (plus 3 song demo tape) on CD or Vinyl  7) Demo tape as a cassette  8) Book/photos etc  9) MSRP of $99 (after all, you are only getting 4 CDs or albums, 1 DVD, 1 casette, and a book-so $99 would be a very fair price).    So, yeah, big disappointment for me. And, it just seems to miss the mark of  what a big fan would want. And, a very high price in this economy.    So, before you buy into the hype, take a close look at what you are getting...
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|On par with Ray of Light. It is the only Madonna album I can listen to all the way without having the urge to cut it off. Her other albums contain alot of filler songs that have no melodies or catchiness, but this album.. all songs are catchy and upbeat and creative. I love it. A+++++++
B001L4NJIO|1.0|I was expecting the same music quality as other Sting titles of this Blu Ray title, but they did a very bad mix, with a subtle bass and bad guitar recording.  I do not recomend to buy it.
B001MYIXAW|1.0|They obviously do not respect the work, the director, and most of all, the audience.  That in this day and age they will choose to cheap out and use substandard subtitles, knowing full well that consumers will have an outlet to complain and therefore hurt their sales, simply means one thing: they didn't care! Well guess what? Now they will have to reissue this disc, or else it WILL HURT their bottom line.  We have to take a stand and DEMAND they correct their gross negligence.    UPDATE: Unbelievable.  Just read the comment saying that they WILL REISSUE the disc but that they WILL NOT HAVE AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM for those who purchased their DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. So let me get this straight; those of us who love this film, preordered it, then pointed out their mistake, thereby saving others from a mutilated film end up being PUNISHED because of it? Magnolia, you're a real class act.
B001ILFUD2|1.0|My family and I collect Disney movies, especially the Plantinum ones, so it was a no-brainer that my 10-year old wanted the 20th Anniversary Edition of Oliver and Company (even though neither one of us had ever seen it before).<br /><br />Knowing how wonderful past animated Disney movies based on cats or dogs delighted us ([[ASIN:B000XUOIQ4 The Aristocats]], [[ASIN:B000B8QG4A Lady and the Tramp]], [[ASIN:B000YERP2S 101 Dalmatians]], etc.), I bought it.<br /><br />Boy were we disappointed! The animation wasn't that great and the film felt very dated rather than timeless--especially with the inclusion of 80's era vehicles, Billy Joel music/beats, breakdancers on the sidewalk, etc.<br /><br />But that's not the bad part, really. None of the characters were memorable--we are given no reason to care for any of them. There is a lot of cigar smoking, violence, threats and menace. Who wants that in a Disney movie? (Yes, I realize it's based loosely on Oliver Twist--hence, Fagin and company--but it's an awful adaptation.)<br /><br />The plot was lame--The Aristocats portrays a similar theme with much more panache, heart, admirable voice acting, lovely animation, and FANTASTIC music. If you want to get an animated cat movie, get that one instead!<br /><br />My son, who has lower standards than I do (chuckle) said he wanted to \\"sell it at a yardsale\\". He has never, EVER done that with an animated Disney movie--and after the first viewing!<br /><br />Seriously, pass on Oliver and Company--especially with its high price. You're much better off getting something from the Platinum collection--Pinocchio, Cinderella, etc.--than this awful movie.
031606792X|1.0|As an older reader, I enjoyed the first 3 books. They were something fun to read and a way for me to bond with my daughters. I had already heard some spoilers about the book and had many people tell me that this book was way different than the other 3, so I was prepared. Or so I thought.  Nothing could have prepared me for this monster. As others have said it was like it was written by someone else. Or Myers didn't know how to tie up all the loose ends, so she read some of the fan fiction out there, found the most far fetched, weirdest ones and ran with it.  She can use all sorts of descriptive words to tell us how beautiful and sparkley Edward is, but can't even describe the wedding. She can tell in detail the birth of the Nessie monster but can't tell us anything about their honeymoon night. Just kiss, fade to black.  I'm not even going to go into how Myers broke every rule she had set out for vampires. How Bella would  have to sacrifice to become a vampire.  Bella instead of growing as a character becomes even more shallow and selfish than before. Obsessed with her beauty as a vampire and sex. I kept wanting Bella to grow as a woman, to become self confident in herself instead of depending on Edward or Jacob to boost her self esteem.   The Cullens all become half shells of the characters we have grown to love. Rose becomes BFF with Bella, Alice who I loved because she was so full of life and fun, does nothing but go shopping, sit on the steps and then her and Jasper (Jazz) disappear. Esme does nothing and Carlisle who has been a doctor for centuries takes medical advice from Jacob.  The non-fight with the Voltaire seemed to be nothing but page filler for her Disney gone bad happy ending.  Bella gets her sparkley husband, gets to be a vampire without all the suffering of being a newborn, gets to keep her dad in her life, her baby, who she barely takes care of, Jacob gets to stay in her life by being with Nessie monster. No mention of her mother, her other friendsshe abandoned for Edward.   Myers can say whatever she wants. That fans just need to give it time to accept Breaking Dawn like Rob playing Edward, that she wanted to give the fans what they wanted, insert random excuse here. Nothing can excuse a badly written book.  Stick with the first 3 and don't bother with Breaking Dawn.
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|Picking up right after Casino Royale left off, Quantum of Solace finds the vengeance seeking super secret agent James Bond (Daniel Craig) on the warpath.  His interrogation of Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) leads he and M (Judi Dench) to realize that there's a secret organization pulling the strings behind the scenes, and soon enough leads Bond to an environmentalist (Mathieu Amalric) that may be holding the answers that Bond is looking for.  Capably directed by Marc Forster (Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner), Quantum of Solace is quite possibly the most brisk Bond film in years (mostly due to the fact that writers Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade had to rush to avoid the film from being a casualty of the WGA strike), and has no shortage of rousing amounts of action as well as a dynamite closing sequence, but the film has an uneven flow to it as well.  While not on the same level as Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace delivers the goods, and Craig remains an excellent Bond.  His Casino Royale co-stars Jeffrey Wright and Giancarlo Giannini are also on board, and there's some pretty eye candy from newcomers Olga Kurylenko as a woman on her own revenge trip, and Gemma Arterton as the appropriately named Strawberry Fields.  All in all, Quantum of Solace is a fine Bond film on its own merits, and here's hoping that Craig and co. continue to do the character the justice Bond deserves.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Great product this flash will open a lot of alternative shot position that will result in excellent photo
B00008EQ8S|5.0|Bought this cd for my girlfriend as a gift. I would buy from them again. cd had a light scratch and a crack in the case, but can i really complain for ninety cents?
B0000060NH|5.0|Marvin Gaye composed and played in this wonderful jazz-soul soundtrack.  He could not top his previous album (\\"What´s Going On\\" - could anyone into soul top that ?) so he set himself out to make a turn and dedicated his muse and musical juices to a movie soundtrack - and the result is nothing short of great.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Works as advertised. Very fast lock on sattelites and compatible with linux via gpsd (and probably directly - haven't tried). I don't know if it's waterproof and I have no intention of testing that.
0780626494|5.0|I love this movie and placed an order through Amazon.com. However, I have never received the dvd I ordered.  My check went through but no dvd.    This was my first time to order through Amazon and it will be my last.
B0014I4KH6|4.0|Taylor Swift in the newest sensation in the country music industry and her music is a \\"nifty\\", special sound!    Negative, the case came damaged.
0812548094|5.0|Really Enjoyed this book.  Highly recommended.  Usually get books from the library but am seriously considering buying this book!
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|Four stars for the film, one star for the special features.  The so-called special features really amount to a single item, carved up into little bits, and sloppy and irritating as well, with the same items repeated up to 3 times. [The narrator is ill-chosen, and belongs in a National Geographic piece] There's nothing wrong with the footage, but it would be more honest to just let it run as a single interesting item. Of course, we will be offered another 'special edition' down the line, as with Casino Royale.
B00007EDY5|4.0|Works for me, because my camera has no PC socket; however, I did not consider that it does not regulate voltage for older, higher voltage strobes
B000089RVX|5.0|...but I just wanted to give this album five stars and say that I have really enjoyed it. It's dark and brooding and heartfelt. It allows me to rock out and scream and be angry, or sad and crying if I feel like it. If you're into goth or witchcraft or paganism or you're angry, this is a great record, especially for women. Amy Lee, you rock. I can't wait until Amy converts to Wicca and we can get some heavy metal pagan music out of her. As a pagan and owner of a pagan website, I definitely recommend this to pagans looking for awesome music that doesn't sound New Agey or garage band-ish at all.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|I replaced my Standard DVDs with this Blu-Ray set.  Wow!  If you like the Bourne films, and you have a Blu-Ray setup, get this box.  You won't be disappointed!
B001N18HOQ|4.0|I don't see why you remix an album that sold 12 million copies.  The remix disc is too pretty.  The raw angst and emotion is lost.  It now sounds like it was made for radio, just like the remixes on the Greatest Hits CD.  I saw Pearl Jam live before Ten ever came out, and I have followed them throughout their career, but I see the remix as a gimmick.  Maybe there will be those who like it just as much or better, but I'll have mine original please.  This is just an expensive copy of the Unplugged disc for me.  I would have liked to see Unplugged offered by itself.    It still gets 4 stars (3 and a half is probably closer) because it is still Ten and I now have the Unplugged.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Another in the series of Jesse Stone DVDs. Same actor, same crew, same music, different plot. The whole series is quite delightful in a slightly sad, downbeat sort of way. These aren't happy movies, but they certainly are good. If you liked any of the others, buy this one. If you've never seen one, try this one, it's very good and may draw you in to the series.
0793518326|5.0|This book was suggested by a musician friend for my 20 year old son.  He was so surprised and loved it all - he has been consumed by music for the past 5-6 years, writes his own music and lyrics for accoustic and electric guitar, as well as sings.  This was a great gift for any music lover!
B001G9F9IW|5.0|A fairly good Woody Allen movie.  I have to admit I haven't liked much of his work since Annie Hall/Manhattan/Stardust Memories, but this was well-made and moved along well.  And, surprisingly, I liked Penelope Cruz's character the best (I'm not a real P.Cruz fan).  And it looks terrific, with gorgeous scenics.
B000002P6R|5.0|Though I bought this for my wife, and yes we're both big Who fans, her being the biggest though, it's a great album from the 80's and signifies thier love for changing with the times.  Also this album came to us pretty fast.  Keep up the great work!!!
B000H1RFKA|5.0|Best not-seen movie of the last few years.  Made about $12.00 in the theaters, doing better as a DVD.  I love this movie.  Very dry, very droll, very funny, great voice-over by Downey, good writing.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is an ideal \\"bounce-flash.\\"  It is small and compact, so it doesn't take much room in my camera bag and it is small on top of my D40.  The flash flips up thus reducing the harshness of flash shots.  And the exposure is adjusted automatically.  Can't beat that, it's just perfect.
B000I5X80G|5.0|I have at least five different bootlegs of this show.  This official release is sooo much better sounding.  Classic band, classic performance, Danny Whitten dies soon after and it's never the same.  Get this disc!
0142000663|4.0|The book is a classic and for most of the story it shows. The author obviously knows how to use his symbolism through out the selection. It's a good book to use as an example in an English class.<br />Even though the kids might find it boring or slow paced at times, they might find themselves wondering how it ends with the Joad family. But if they focus on the actual purpose of the book, they will be able to understand it a bit better.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Another in the series of Jesse Stone DVDs. Same actor, same crew, same music, different plot. The whole series is quite delightful in a slightly sad, downbeat sort of way.

B001PNVYMO|5.0|Though they never strayed far from greatness, this is certainly a return. What an album. Get the 2CD for the remixes, too. I've been a fan since the late 80s and this is their best since Very.
B001DTUU7A|5.0|My five-year-old loves this film.  I find it a bit over-loud and over the top.  Looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray.
1416914307|5.0|I couldn't have asked for a better ending. I got everything I wanted.  I don't want to summarize the book, I'll leave that to others, but I will say that there are some heartbreakingly beautiful scenes in this book.  The characters became more developed and more endearing, especially Jace.  His sarcastic wit is certainly present in this book; however, he is no longer hiding behind his carefully constructed facade. His torment over Clary is glaringly obvious from the first chapter.    I noticed that another review stated that she wished Clary and Jace hadn't have been as close as they were until they knew the truth about not being related, but I have to disagree.  Clary was the only person in the world that made Jace feel like he belonged and she was the only person he belonged to and the fact that she didn't turn away from him when he told her that he loved her probably meant more to him than her waiting until she knew the truth to love him back the same way. He had resigned himself to love her always, no matter what, and I'm glad that he got to know that she had resigned herself to the same fate.    Cassandra Clare works magic with this novel. The excitement begins on the first page and doesn't stop until the final sentence. She brings everything full circle for a completely satisfying ending - even though fans would be more than happy to read about these beloved characters forever, I know I will miss them.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Good performance and sound.  Much better than all the bootlegs floating around for the past 25+ years.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Before I get to the DVD, just a word about Amazon service.  The set I received initially had 3 discs 2 of which were identical.  Amazon quickly shipped a replacement set and provided a label to return the faulty set.  This is why I love purchasing through Amazon!  Now for the DVD, the acting was incredible.  While not everything in the story was 100% accurate historically, it presented the \\"flavor\\" of the time and an approximation of the events -- my wife, who is far from a history buff, simply loved it and learned a good deal that she missed in high school and college.  All in all, a very worthwhile purchase though I am not that much a fan of McCullough's writings.
B000GBEWHA|4.0|Gosh, what can you say about Grease? It's fun, full of spirit and personality. This is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings. This homage to the 50s (homage, not representation) follows the lives of Sandy and Danny during a year at the fictional Rydell High. They fell in love over the summer, and now find themselves in the same high school. Can they overcome the roles they adopt to save their love?<br /><br />Even though there's a distinct 70s charm to the movie, you truly believe in the 50s atmosphere it has. That it's 1950s USA, and no other place or time. The plot of the film may not have that much going for it in the originality department but it's the personality about the movie that makes it such a joy to watch every time.<br /><br />Indeed, if you're looking for morals, well, you're not gonna find them here. Most of the characters are one-dimensional and many are often than not quite unlikeable (take all the T-Birds). The moral of the movie is quite bad as well; give in to peer pressure and you'll win the man of your dreams. Sandy, girl, you were fine just the way you were. True, she chose to undergo her makeover on her own accord, but all the same, it implies that being innocent and upright is a no-no. My favourite character is Rizzo, the most three-dimensional of the bunch. She acts tough on the outside, but has a tangible vulnerability that she tries to hide. \\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\\" reveals her character in a way that her interaction with her friends doesn't show; she almost upstages Newton-John with this riveting number.<br /><br />Of course, none of this would matter without the music! This is what makes the film so much fun. This movie is chock-full of songs that you just want to get up and dance to, feel sad to, reflect to. Mostly get up and dance to, though. One of my favourite scenes is the dance in the high school gym; a more fun dance extravaganza has hardly ever been caught on film. Just try and sit still when watching. You just want to enter the screen and join in. It's incredible.<br /><br />Okay, it has a pretty bad moral. Yes, the characters don't remotely look like they are really teenagers. But what the hell, I love Grease. It's one of those films that I think every man and woman should see at least once in their life.enter the screen and join in. It's incredible.

B001U0HBPQ|4.0|So I got me a copy of \\"The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button\\" and I'll tell you what, I didn't expect what I got. It was an awesome movie in every sense of the word. If you love life then you should see this movie because this is life at it's best. A journey through a mans life that is running backwards in age was very interesting, the only part I thought was weird was when he was getting younger and eventually went back to being a baby. Other than that this was a great story about just living your life to the fullest and to just be happy no matter what life throws at you, If you liked \\"[[ASIN:B00AEFY0F2 Forrest Gump]]\\" than you should like this movie.<br /><br />Cate Blancett did a very good job as Benjamin's love and I thought her to be more attractive than usual in this one. All around good acting and a great life and love story, highly recommend this for everyone to see. But on a side note, love life and live it to the fullest everyday because someday we all gotta go, why not make the best outta what we have? That's how this movie inspired me, to live my life to the fullest and to be happy with everything I have and not to take life for granted. I really hope some of you watch this movie and feel what I felt from it.

B001LMU182|5.0|Akira is worth buying if you're a fan of the movie, but is also one of the only Blu-Ray movies available to have a 192 Khz Dolby True HD audio track. Most people's home theaters will not support this, but if you have a high end receiver, you are in luck. The sound alone is worth the purchase.   the movie itself is a classic, and I wont go into details, as there are already thousands of reviews of this movie.     The blu ray lacks extras due to the massive amount of space the audio track takes up. So i have no problem with it.     Akira on BluRay is the new showcase for my Onkyo 705 receiver, and Energy speakers.
B001E3E1J8|4.0|The paperback book that was sent to me was in good condition, so have no complaints regarding same.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|The remix CD is the main reason why I purchased this re-release. This is not a radical remixing - I would say it's 90% the same as the original. But it's really cool hearing a fresh take on a classic CD. Overall, there is less reverb so everything seems a little clearer, more up-front and just overall more \\"modern\\" sounding (in a good way). There are certain nuances that you hear that were buried in the previous mix and other things that are no longer as noticable. If you are like me, some parts you will like better than the original and others not as much; but it's a great concept that was pulled off very well. Some things are more drastic changes, such as the vocals on Oceans are very dry (without the highly-processed flange effect from the original). I still think I like the original mix better but the remix is worth buying for fans of the album who want to hear a new twist on it.     However... the original re-mix remastered is even better! Unlike many recent remastered reissues that just add a limiter to make the CD \\"louder\\" while sucking out the dynamics, this one is done by mastering legend Bob Ludwig and is incredible!! The sound is a lot clearer and up-front and seems to have even more dynamics than the original. This is not why I bought the re-issue but this is the main reason I'm glad I did!!
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|A great flash if you need to control one or more external speedlights, and your camera doesn't have built in control for external flashes.  Works even better as a fill flash coupled with an SB-600 and diffusers.  Pre-flashes coordinate light at the time of exposure, and I've gotten some great photos with it, particularly portraits.
B001QB9H10|2.0|Having purchased all of the transporter movies. I have to say this is most disappointing. There's a lot of bad acting and the dialogue just stinks. While I enjoyed Jason Statham is this movie. This movie has truly run it course. Please No Transporter 4.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|I can't quite remember when I bought Pearl Jam's debut \\"Ten,\\" (1991) it was either 1992 or '93--way back when I was in the eighth grade. Back then this was the album that every friggin' kid at Ottoson jr. high owned. It might be hard to remember now, but back then Pearl Jam was the band that just about everyone seemed to like and they were everywhere--TIME magazine, SNL, MTV Unplugged, etc. Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" (1991) may have changed the tide in rock, but back in the early 90s, before Cobain's tragic suicide, it was Pearl Jam that was the world's most popular band.<br /><br />To say that \\"Ten\\" defined an era or a generation sounds cliche, but it's more-or-less true. There was a time, a brief moment in the early 90s when a whole generation of kids embraced Pearl Jam and \\"Ten\\" in particular.<br /><br />As the 90s and the 00s have worn on Pearl Jam have released a very impressive body of work and I while I have thoroughly enjoyed each album, I find myself always returning to \\"Ten\\" as my personal favorite. It seems to be the one that I always listen to on my I-pod and the one whose songs I always seem to hear on the radio.<br /><br />Why was \\"Ten\\" so successful? There are a bunch of reasons (1) they had a brooding, good-lucking frontman in Eddie Vedder, (2) the whole atmosphere of the \\"alternative\\" early 90s, (3) they sounded fresh in an era that came after the \\"hair band\\" 80s, etc. Most importantly however, the band just wrote really great songs.<br /><br />The whole \\"grunge\\" label has been totally overplayed with \\"Ten,\\" in my humble opinion. To me \\"grunge\\" is early Soundgarden, Nirvana, Mudhoney, etc--something with distortion and \\"fuzz.\\" \\"Ten\\" doesn't have any of those elements at all. Rather, as Steve Huey notes in his allmusic review, \\"Ten\\" is more of a classic rock album, in the style of Hendrix, Clapton, etc, but without a bluesy influence. While the album's hooks, melodies and, overall, almost arena-rock styling may have alienated some who may have considered them \\"sellouts,\\" it's easy to see why \\"Ten\\" was so popular.<br /><br />This new deluxe CD comes with a remastered version of the album, a second CD, which has been remixed by Brendan O'Brien and a DVD of Pearl Jam's 1992 MTV unplugged concert.<br /><br />The remastered CD in all honesty isn't a huge improvement over the original album. This isn't so much because a bad job was done at the remastering, but rather because while some albums released in 1991 could definitely use a remastering, the original \\"Ten\\" already sounds great the way it is. Still, this new 2009 version sounds a little sharper and clearer.<br /><br />The real interesting disc in this set is the remixed version as there is a noticeable difference. If you have ever watched \\"Bladerunner\\" the original 1982 version and then watched the '92 or '07 director's cut you might know what I am talking about. It's basically the same movie, but with just a few slight alterations it's a totally different viewing experience. The same applies to \\"Ten,\\" as taking the same songs and altering the mix makes for a totally different listening experience.<br /><br />This new version sounds more like PJ's other 90s albums, which is of little surprise since O'Brien produced those as well. On this alternate version the drums sound maybe a little louder, some of the guitars and backing vocals seem a little more prominent and the album, overall, sounds far less polished and rawer than the original mix.<br /><br />So which is better? It's honestly hard to say. I'm so used to \\"Ten\\" the way it originally is this version sounds downright...weird. Still, the more I listen to it the more I like it. While I think the polished sound of the original mix really works for \\"Ten,\\" especially on songs like \\"Black,\\" \\"Garden\\" and \\"Jeremy,\\" this new version sounds cool too. It's actually great that the band chose to re-release \\"Ten\\" with both versions, as this way the band can rework a classic recording with a new spin but at the same time cangive their fans the album they know and love the way they remember it.<br /><br />The bonus songs are cool but not essential. None of them sound as good as anything from \\"Ten.\\" and one is better off with the \\"Singles\\" (1992) soundtrack for \\"Breath\\" and \\"State of Love and Trust\\" as those versions sound better than the earlier renditions found here.<br /><br />The DVD of the unplugged concert is really cool and will take you right back to 1992. The packaging of the entire set is simply awesome--with tons of photos, flyers, pictures from the \\"Singles\\" movie, etc. It's a great snapshot of the band's early career and of the early 90s.ey remember it.

B001EOQWEO|1.0|This is the most boring movie Pixar has ever made. (And one of the most boring EVER made!)  It was almost painful to get through.  My son who is 3 LOVES the other Pixar movies, so I thought this would be right up his alley.  Three-quarters of the way through he was asleep.  My husband and I watched the rest just to see what would happen, but my son refuses to watch it again.  Just hates it.  It's a great adult commentary on the world today, but does not translate well into a children's movie AT ALL.
B000003TA4|2.0|Sorry --This type of music was done better by the likes of Husker Du,Meat Puppets,etc. Listenable and competent but groundbreaking??--I personally dont think so. Hats off to Nirvana for being in the right place at the right time at around the same age as a bunch of disaffected suburban kids in the US. And to the guy who said this album stands up to Never Mind The Bollocks and London Calling--you have got to be kidding!!
B001MYIXAC|1.0|This is another warning about the subtitles.  I saw Let the Right One In while it was in theaters, and it is a great film.  But these terrible subtitles completely ruin it.  Do not buy it until Magnolia gets its act together and releases the original film.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I want to clarify that the upgrade is in the second disc, the first disc is basically the same great looking 2002 release (complete with the original bonus material).<br />The only exception is that the Deleted Scenes have been moved over to disc 2.  Strangely, the Theatrical Promos have been copied over to disc 2 also, but they are still included on disc 1.<br />I believe this is essentially the intended 2004 2-Disc set that never got released, but with some updates to the 2+ hour documentary on disc 2.  Which also explains why no Blu-Ray, this is not a re-mastering of the movie.  But for regular DVD you can not complain, the movie looks great.  This also means those upgrading, like me, don't have to worry that something was changed (like the recent Piniocchio re-master) and they can get rid of their original DVD.<br />For the serious animation fan, disc 2 is the disc we have long been waiting for.  Upgrading to this set is a no-brainer, yes - upgrade.<br />But if you just like the movie & have no interest in how it was made, then the original single disc version is good enough.  There is no need to buy it again.<br /><br />However, this could be one of the big marketing snafu's of Disney history.<br />1) In 2004 this movie was still at the height of its popularity, today it is almost forgotten.  Had this come out in 2004 it would have been a big media spash.  Sales would have been through the roof (not tomention the better economy then).<br />2) This 2-disc release was released the very same day as the new-to-DVD Bolt.  All eyes & promotions seem to focused on Bolt.<br />3) Today Blu-Ray is the way to go for serious fans & there is no Blu-Ray release of this 2-disc version.  And it is the serious fans who will upgrade for the 2+ hour documentary.<br /><br />In the first day of it's 2-disc DVD release, there are only 4 reviews.  That shows how this great movie has slipped out of the consiousness of the public.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is my first review, but this beautiful, stunning film is worth it. It works on so many levels and bears repeated watching. The little girl deserved an Oscar, as did the cinematography. The story shifts, as all storytelling does. Just go with it and let it carry you. I have had many moments of reflection from this film, and all of them good! Buy it and share it with your friends. I did and it has enriched our lives.
B001KL3GWM|3.0|I had high hopes for Already Free after enjoying the spectacular Songlines and reading the mostly positive reviews here. But after listening a few times I came to the conclusion that he is just coasting.  Already Free opens well. The gritty vocals and searing guitar licks on Down In The Flood fill the air with the promise of more greatness to come. The driving and soulful Something To Make You Happy augments that promise. But then it starts to fall apart with Maybe This Time, which sounds like an awful imitation of one of John Mayall's rare stinkers and sinks further with a cover of the very commercial Sweet Inpiration that is salvaged only by Trucks' guitar heroics. Things pick up again with a virile, bluesy Don't Miss Me but then coast most of the rest of the way with only I Know provoking the listener to focus on the music once again.  Though my high hopes for Already Free are somewhat dashed, it is good enough for an occasional listen. The CD comes with an attractive insert containing pertinent album information, pictures and a couple of hagiographic essays by a music journalist and an ex-producer. Those who like Derek Trucks no matter what will likely love this album, but those who are more detached will agree that Already Free is no Songlines.
0060763280|5.0|Great book for all ages. I highly recommend it. Also, if at all possible, try to attend one of T.Harv Eker's seminars for a life-changing experience.
B0009YKWAK|5.0|This is an very entertaining movie. The entire cast play off each other very well.  Characters are very believeable.  A bit of a tortured soul theme going on in the background but the main plot is all action & suspense. Well plotted and executed movie.  If I had seen this in a cinema it would have been worth the cost of admission & a bag of popcorn!
B001DDBCUK|5.0|Way better than I expected! I watch it again and again and cry every time!
B001FBSMW6|2.0|I have adored Keane since they came to prominence five years ago with the beautiful and brilliant 'Hopes And Fears'; but this album shows that most of what they were is not here. This is the sort of tripe that gets cranked out to pay for rehab, and it's a genuine tragedy to hear what's happened to them. For their sakes, I hope Keane will return to the lush and amazing sound that made them famous.
B001JNNE64|5.0|Great movie, stands the test of time. Blu-ray transfer is great! The added scenes are solid but if you have seen this movie as many times as I have, they really stand out as odd... That's not something I would count against it. The music and the way it is used in the film is spectacular.
031606792X|5.0|I was slightly put off by some of the plot-things, but in the end it is an amazing read, a must. I had no option but to read it, and I haven't regretted it =)
B001NFNFNU|3.0|For starters, I loved the look and feel of the classic '20's! I felt that some parts kinda dragged on for a while, like dumb ol' JJ Jones keeps telling Christine Collins that the boy is her son, even though it isn't. It's a good thing I didn't live back then, because the police would NOT have been a big help. I'm glad I saw it, but I probably wouldn't watch it again. If you like sexy Angelina Jolie, the classic '20s, and mysteries, you might like CHANGELING!!!
B0000YEEHG|4.0|Often I've read people describe Bergman as essentially a crazy, unpleasant old man living in isolation on a remote island.  Haven't you?  Imagine:  People visit him there, at their peril, it seems, for one has the impression that he lived as a kind of diffident hermit spider who survived on the psychic juice he squeezed out of his victims, which stress-derived juice he transmuted into the visions and insights that became, eventually, his neurasthenic screenplays.  Seems plausible enough.  And here, viewing-reading PERSONA, this cinematic ESSAY ON DEPRESSION projected as a relapse into apathy by a famous actress -- reading it backwards and forwards and looking at it from many angles -- as one should with most abstract art, one can fairly well make out how and out of what material he contrived this movie.    It is a period piece, remember, arising out of that era of Cold War anxiety and Existential nausea -- late 50s - mid 70s -- when nothing seemed either solid or valuable.  It was a time when Psychoanalysis and Shrinks (like Sybils) of different stripes were thought weighty both as symbols and characters in stories (LADY IN THE DARK, EQUS, SPELLBOUND, ON A CLEAR DAY) about the struggles of individuals with and protests against society.  And so Bergman, who was notorious for his psychic instability -- in common with other european auteurs like Almodovar, Passolini and Fassbinder -- dredged the muckbins of his unconscious memories, for themes and incidents he could use.  And, he cannibalized material from others of his friends and colleagues. And he stole for effect when it s uited him; the most obvious example of it being the insertion in the screenplay of the most famous footage from the Viet Nam War, that of the self-immolation of a Buddhist monk, burning for a seeming eternity in the middle of a Saigon street.  Horror (and outrage) by association.  Which is to say, without cost.  Or personal involvement.    We can reconstruct it this way:  Probably at some point Bergman has a mini-breakdown; a fit of apathy like a dry patch of inspiration.  Screenwriter's Block.  He goes to a sympathetic and well-to-do Therapist who is sensitive to his position as ornament of Swedish Theatre and Film, and recommends a stay at his summer, beachfront home.  (The location proves fortuitous for it is close where in future, Bergman will build a home for himself.  There, later, several other of his meditations on mental illness will be written, and some will be filmed.)    Whether it actually true or not, through creative visualization, Bergman switches genders and envisions a situation where the silent, near catatonic patient (based on himself) and her care-taker will assume \\"roles.\\"  (Re-examine Genet's THE MAIDS.)  The roles they assume in the film are that of the patient and Psychiatrist.  (Not Male/Female but Dominant/Passive.)  In typical Freudian theory and practice, the patient transfers his/her concerns on to the Therapist who remains not quite silent, but both distant and non-assertive.    This is very likely a situation familiar to Bergman who was himself cold and distant and non-communicative, often.  And it known that as a womanizer, and charming, he often chose women who were younger and more open, or more suceptible to his crafty form of control and manipulation.  (The Sadie/Mazie waltz.)    In PERSONA, the central confession of the Care-giver/now Patient, is of an intimate, sexual nature.  (Again here, there is a touch of alcohol as the barrier-breaking medium of self-revelation.  [AUTUMN SONATA.]  Which makes me think Bergman probably liked to drink, and got some of his material from his drinking partners.)  Unique in the film's writing, it has the character of an overheard or pilfered confession or recollection from some woman, and here, is used to provoke within the ambiguity of the mis-en-scene, a feeling of sexual ambiguity -- call it a lesbian tweak -- that allows Nyquist to suggest with his camera all kinds innuendos, visually, silently, without degenerating into smut, and this to such a degree that the screen has the look of a Fashion Magazine spread of the period with shots composed in the manner of the fashionable fashion photographers of the day; Penn, Avadon, etc.  In this respect PERSONA is like a hard cover cocktail table book of Blonde-on-Blonde Lesbian Pornography, with the softest conceivable core, and the devine Liv Ulman as the eternal center spread.    Whether or not you think any of these musings even remotely plausible, you are likely to enjoy the film if you are attracted to abstract art, generally, and are entertained by the ambiguities of films of the period like Renais' LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, or Antonioni's L'AVENTURA.  From the very first credits, both artsy, eccentric and disturbing, and that angular irritable music undernearth them, meaning: CAUTION, Montage (or pastiche) ahead, to the initial shot of Ulman heavily painted and in costume playing in a Greek Tragedy and having her fit of Stage Fright or spasm of psychic paralysis, you will know that you're in for a bumpy ride and may expect to be dragged with all deliberate speed over one of the cold beaches of polished rocks off the Swedish holiday coast.  It's a very interesting ride on any number of levels.      When you think of its comparatively brief duration, of PERSONA's tiny cast, and of its black and white format, you may be prompted to realize, with astonishment, how tiny the production budget must have been, and to realize with dawning respect and amazement, with what economy of word and image Bergman and his cinematographer, Nyquist,  managed to construct such a towering hour and a half of fascination.  Like all movies, it's all smoke and mirrors, of course, a shadow play, but their effective articulation is a question of masterful dexterity.  And in PERSONA, the display of the director's Skill in manipulating his ensemble is the star of the show.
B001MYIXAC|1.0|The DVD and Blu-Ray's subtitles are new, dumbed down versions which substantially ruin the film.
1416550534|4.0|I'm generally not a fan of the English manor house story, but I found myself very engrossed in this novel, and I enjoyed it tremendously.  I did find the character of Emmeline to be a little less finely drawn than others, but the pace of the novel and the quality of the story make this more of a quibble than a substantial weakness.  I can see why this book has been so popular with readers.
B001FOPODS|1.0|Boy, what a disappointing DVD.  I had hoped they would follow the story but they decided to change it into a dark and dreay tale.
B001EO748M|5.0|I love this series. It's great to see it all in one or two days instead of every week for 13 weeks. The story is closer to the truth than any other stories I have seen. That was a very interesting era in England and this series keeps you wanting to learn more about it. I can't wait for the new season to begin.  Love Jonathan Rhys Meyers. He is a great King Henry. Only drawback on the DVD was that I could not get the subtitles to come up.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I read the book straight through in as few sessions as I could only stopping to sleep eat etc.  It makes me want to demand of the new Administration a war on Alzheimer's with enough money to find a cure in time for all the Alices and their loved ones. I pray for the researchers that they find the right path to a complete cure soon.  I lost an aunt to dementia (not sure if she specifically had Alzheimer,s).  This book reminds me that we are not how we die but how we lived and it is the accomplishments 9of one's life that are how we should be remembered\honored. should be on every 50 something reader's book list.
B001EO748M|4.0|I watched both seasons and I love world history. Most of the sex scenes were a little overstated.  I am not a prude but if I had a teenager at home I would recommend that you not allow them to see this graphic matter. But I loved the series anyway, King Henry and Elizabeth were my two favorite monarchs.  Adult supervision a must....
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We bought this game as a christmas gift for our 12 year old son and my husband and I are now totally hooked.  We usually play once a week and it is always fun.  Although my husband usually wins most strategy board games - for some reason with Catan it is a little more evenly split on wins.  There are enough variables that there are several ways to try to get to 10 points and we also think there is some educational value for our son.  Our six year old will also play sometimes, although the strategy involved is beyond her level, she still enjoys collecting resources and building settlements and cities.  My only complaint is that our first set was missing some roads, but Amazon promptly replaced the defective version.  I also have no clue which version we have, it's not clearly labeled on the box.  But, otherwise - a great game!  We plan to buy it for our close friends and we are going to buy an expansion for our son's birthday.
1401216676|5.0|Excellent Batman story.  Alan Moore's writing is brilliant and like The Dark Knight, gives you an insight into the Joker's twisted mind prior to going totally crazy.<br /><br />Especially (as it's shown everyday in the world we live in today), day in and day out, sometimes all is takes for someone to totally lose it is one bad day.<br /><br />Short read, but a must have for any Batman fan.
1603580557|5.0|A system is made out of processes and if you look at the overall picture in the beginning, then prioritize from there how to handle the process, adaptation and change happens like magic.  This book really makes this idea relevant and the author writes it with such ease that you marvel at how simple the concept really is.  I definitely am keeping this book as part of my basic library in order to remind me that everything is always connected.  This will definitely help me focus on systems thinking for better process improvement, since it is definitely a cascading effect.
B00000K31V|1.0|This movie is aimed at juveniles who want to scream \\"EWWW!\\" at every other scene.      Whole movie goes like this: Guy takes a mutant frog, cuts it open, plays with its guts.  They do some version of this over and over, ad nauseam, through the entire movie.    I got suckered into buying it because of the glowing reviews and promise of a twist ending.  The \\"twist ending\\" was exactly what you would expect from a movie about being inside a video game.
B0000669JL|5.0|Legend is a CLASSIC tht should belong in every music collection for it to be complete.  It doesn't contain some of the earlier more raw output of Marley, but is the perfect introduction to Marley and, if you can only have one of his albums, is the best and most complete representation of his work.  Every cut is GREAT!!
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|The Dr. Who episode \\"Silence in the Library\\"/\\"Forest of the Dead\\" is the best Dr. Who episode ever made in the history of time and relative dimensions in space.  Full of creepy spooky goodness and hardcore sci-fi. Buy the 4th season just for this.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|this movie was not a typical Baz Luhrmann movie.  i don't mind it when directors stray from their usual genre, in fact i encourage it, but this movie screenplay read like a trashy romance novel.  i was not impressed.  i kept waiting for it to end- repeatedly thinking that the end had arrived and then being forced to sit through yet another weakly plotted twist. it was big on the screen as all Baz movies are, but it didn't capture me the way Moulin Rouge or Romeo + Juliet did.
B000CNESU8|5.0|I have nothing new to add to the great reviews except to those who complain about the audio/visual issues. Those points are valid, but in the case of this movie, I think content trumps asthetics.
B000Y2WAKM|5.0|Very rarely would I call a compilation cd a classic, but \\"Meet The eels: Essential Eels 1996-2006, Vol. 1\\" is as classic an album as any other \\"proper\\" album release that has been deemed a classic. As usual with compilations fans will quibble about  songs that were excluded (For me, Mental off the debut album Beautiful Freak is one such song), but since ALL of the 24 songs included are excellent examples of E's superior songwriting genius, for once any criticism really is redundant. Song choices, sequencing, artwork, packaging - it's all extremely well-executed.<br /><br />E's lyrics are often bittersweet. In 3 Speed he sings: \\"Life is funny, but not ha-ha funny\\". Even so, the lyrics are humorous and engaging. Lyric sample from That's Not Really Funny: \\"Did you think I would laugh, when you said I was small? Did you think that that would pass, as if nothing at all?\\"<br /><br />Some of my personal favorites: Your Lucky Day In Hell, My Beloved Monster, Flyswatter, Souljacker Part 1, That's Not Really Funny, Fresh Feeling, (Hey Man) Now you're really Living, The Trouble with Dreams.<br /><br />This compilation is a very good place to start your Eels collection.<br /><br />\\"Useless Trinkets: B-sides, soundtracks, rarities and unreleased 1996-2006\\" is a nice companion piece, but not as essential as \\"Meet The Eels: Essential Eels 1996-2006, Vol. 1\\".
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|What can I say. Why are you still reading reviews? Go get this album ASAP. Of and also get the Prospekt's March edition while you are at it - Life in Technicolor ii will just blow your mind
3795753384|5.0|I found it very helpful to have the score with the piano reduction, so I can track what the other part, the  orchestra and the soloists are doing.     One worries about coming in wrong, and losing count of dozens of measures.    Great book, great price!     Thank you!!!!
B001N18HO6|3.0|When I heard about this release I was excited... but even then I was having trouble justifying the price tag for this set. It just didn't seem to have enough substantial value (i.e. actual music) to justify the price, especially when the meat and potatoes of the set (the remastered album, the redux w/ bonus tracks and the Unplugged DVD) is available separately for under $30.    But I just had to get it... I knew I wouldn't be happy unless I did. I'm a Pearl Jam fanatic. They're my favorite band of all time. No other group has ever recorded music that I can relate to as much as PJ. I love all the albums and I have bought countless concert bootlegs. I have seen them live a number of times as well. So I suppose you could say that I would be the target audience for this set... and you'd be right because I begrudingly bought it.     After reviewing all of the material, my initial summation proved correct. There just isn't enough value in this set to justify the price tag. Especially considering the omission of important b-sides of the era such as \\"Yellow Ledbetter,\\" \\"Wash,\\" \\"Dirty Frank,\\" \\"Footsteps,\\" \\"Let Me Sleep,\\" etc. True, all of those tracks are available on \\"Lost Dogs\\" but the spine of the set does proudly proclaim \\"PEARL JAM: 1990-1992,\\" does it not? Omitting these seminal PJ tracks seems like an odd move.    Also disappointing was the lack of a CD for the Unplugged show. For years we fans have been listening to shoddy bootleg versions of the concert. Don't get me wrong, the DVD is awesome to have, but since they already went to the trouble to partner with MTV for the DVD, could a CD really have been that difficult to produce?     The composition book and other printed materials were interesting but there was hardly anything that made a die-hard like me drool. A lot of pictures of the band and live performances. The \\"Place/Date\\" book is probably more interesting but that's a matter of opinion. The vintage \\"Ten\\" poster is very cool, but I'm too old to be hanging up posters!    Now onto the records. I have fond memories of vinyl from childhood. Up until I was ten I was perfectly content with records. Then my brother brought home a CD player and that was the end of that. Audiophiles always claim that vinyl sounds better than CDs. I went retro in college and bought a $200 Sony turntable and a small collection of records. I wasn't impressed. Flipping back and forth between the same song on vinyl and CD, it was clear to me that the CD was infinitely superior. A brand new, never-before-played record sounded muddy and without punch. The CD sounded dynamic and full. Anyway, as a hardcore PJ fan and procurer of their fan club singles, I was prepared for the vinyl in the set. I dusted off the turntable and hooked it up to my component CD recorder to make a nice copy.     So i was about halfway through transferring the vinyl to CD... I took the second record out of the gatefold and a little scrap of paper falls to the floor. It reads: \\"While we recommend you listen to Drop in the Park as it was meant to be, on glorious 180 gram vinyl, we have provided high-quality mp3s for those more comfortable in the digital world.\\" All you have to do is enter the download code on the website to get a nice copy of the concert. A very nice touch indeed! If only they had also provided mp3s of the Momma-Son tape. I dusted off my old Walkman and enjoyed the three demos. The quality was decent but basically what you would expect from a demo. If you're like me, you've always wondered what that fateful demo tape sounded like and now we know. It's no wonder that Vedder was soon on a plane to Seattle.    The Drop in the Park concert was excellent... a lot of raw early girder-climbing PJ energy. It was pretty short (under an hour) but a very fun listen. Does it stand up to their best concerts today? Definitely not but it's a great timepiece of the band in that era.     So was I disappointed with the set? Not really. I knew what would be in it (except for the mp3 bonus of Drop in the Park) so I had no reason to be disappointed. Is it worth the price tag? Probably not, but if you're a die-hard PJ fan like me and you have the money to burn, you have no choice but to buy it.
B000FC1K66|5.0|This is the first book I have read on the kindle and it was a great start. The book it told in first person looking back starting during WWII of this mans life. He is 15yrs old when he meets a 40yr old German lady. Whom he falls in love with and they have an affair.<br /><br />Later she is tried for Nazi war crimes and he is at the trial. I'll not tell any more details.<br /><br />What is so profound about the book are his emotions it is like this writer gets into your mind and weaves this person into your very being. I love deep books like this.<br />If you like WWII historical fiction and romance with depth of emotion this is for you.<br /><br />I'd not recommend it for under high school age due to the graphic sexual scenes. The language is good infact I leared some new and interesting words. Great book.
0670020478|5.0|Having been recently laid off and having not been totally impassioned by my recent employment, reading \\"The Element\\" has proven timely.  Particularly useful its Ken Robinson's underlying quadrichotomy: Aptitude (I get it), Passion (I love it), Attitude (I want it), and Opportunity (Where is it)?  As I seek my next opportunity - as an employee, or with further growth of my own consulting business - I will ensure I find what I love so I get what I want.  In the spirit of the \\"Beyond Imagining\\" chapter, I shall create this not simply imagine it.    I did find Robinson's last two chapters somewhat irritating.  In them - particularly \\"Making the Grade\\" -  Robinson gets close to whining about the state of education.  I felt he had lost his own positive message from the earlier chapters.    All in all an inspiring read ... now it's up to me to put it all in practice.

B00005JO5L|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Cruising's problem isn't that it's too controversial, or too exploitative, or too dated--its problem is that it's just not a very compelling movie; with a central mystery that isn't interesting and an enigma of a lead character in Pacino's Steve Burns, the movie simply fails to engage the audience.
B00007G207|5.0|A film than never loses its freshness and enjoyment. By far one of the most superior films ever made in any language. From start to finish, you become involved with the characters. They are people you care about and feel the pain and sorrow they encounter. The director's cut is 51 minutes longer than the theatrical release, and is definately worth watching. A true masterpiece in film making.
0784011176|5.0|Great performances by all actors involved, and a dark, beautiful tale of forbidden love, raw passion, jealousy, wanting, contrasting cultures and personalities. The story is tender and sweet one moment, a psychological thriller the next; a sensual, humorous, curious, fabulous film with spectacular cinematography.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|I think ths James Bond movie is a bit overrated by professional critics because they were so happy to see Sean Connery end his 12-year hiatus from playing Bond that they didn't dare criticize the film.     What disappointed me most was the ending. After investing two hours into the film, you expect a less-hokey, more satisfying ending.  Also - and this may be nitpicking, but I was disappointed in not seeing the regular actors in the supporting roles such as Miss Moneypenny, Q, Felix Leiter, etc.    On the positive side, there was plenty of unique action scenes, particularly early on, and the two villains were interesting. I thought Klaus Maria Brandauer was the more intriguing of the two because he was so low-key and looked the \\"nice guy next door.\\" He wasn't your normal Bond villain.    This had plenty of \\"skin,\\" for a PG movie, especially with Kim Basinger starring, never being an actress known for hiding her figure.  All in all, it's a \\"fair\\" Bond and nothing else. Just because Connery is in it, it doesn't mean it's automatically good. Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan proved they could play the role well, too.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall (Deluxe Packaging Digitally Remastered) being Pink Floyd's 1979 release is a concept album that included the hits \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\" , \\"Run Like Hell\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\". This album holds a special place in my heart as I sang \\"Another brick in the wall (Part 2)\\" at highschool. The booklet is very strange with hard to read lyrics and avantgarde art that is hard to understand. Still and all this is just as good as other rock classics such as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , Highway 61 Revisited and Pet Sounds. 5/5.

Though I consider myself a pretty good vocalist, having gone through many years of voice training, I still can't match Sara's voice enough to sing this song! And how it breaks my heart that I can't sing it! Sara's music is what I consider \\"coffee shop\\" music. You can hum along while sipping your coffee and surfing the net. It would also not be out of place in a lounge bar. I would put her up there with Nora Jones and/ or Anna Nalick.<br />Very good lyrics, very melodic piano skills and easy to listen to- and try to hum along to!
B001EO748M|5.0|I love this series. The second season is as good as the first.  It is very well done, very dramatic and very entertaining.
B001K98MFU|5.0|Truth be told I never used to like this movie, but after being re-exposed to it with this Blu-ray release it's become one of my favorite installments in the GITS franchise.    Maybe when I saw it before with subtitles I had trouble understanding the crazy plotline.  (GITS is hard enough to understand English)  For those of you who've seen the movie before and not liked it, you owe it to yourself to give it another chance like I did in flawless 1080p video quality and English dub.    People have been complaining that this release is a \\"disgrace\\" because it doesn't have lossless audio tracks and one of the 2 English tracks is completely messed up.  These problems didn't bother me at all because I'm not a audiophile by any means and don't even have the hardware to utilize lossless audio.  Also while it is true that the UK English dub track included on this disc is so badly off-pitch that is sounds like all the characters have Down's Syndrome, it's a moot point because they've also included a new (and more accurate) English dub that has absolutely no problems and really improved the viewing experience for me.
B001EO748M|4.0|The second season is as compelling as the first although a little humor would help the script. I was disappointed that the set only includes 10 episodes instead of the customary 12 or more and am tired of promotions that offer you individual episodes of other series, only to find out that you have to go online and hunt for a streaming version in order to view it. Better not to disappoint the purchaser.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Great DVD! Having attended this show, it is nice to be able to relive the included sets that showcase a wide variety of styles and classic performances that mesh together magically with the exception of the final two acts: the worn Santana drum/synth sound (what happened to his guitar?) and the ZZ Top 'cartoon show' we have all seen repeated a million times over in arenas and at the Super Bowl. I am an original ZZ fan from the beginning but I am so looking forward to Rick Rubins 'makeover' of our \\"Little Old Band\\".  Still, thanks to Eric Clapton for delivering an awesome 3 days of music to my doorstep.

The set is gorgeous and full of surprises with an Elsinore custom made for \\"lawful espials\\" and it does rare justice to the Fortinbras subplot.  You cannot go wrong with Branaugh.

B000C4BATE|4.0|This debut album is a very solid release.  While the material isn't out-of-this world in its artistry or production value, it is definitely a cut above the pop music status quo in these respects.  The material really does seem to come from John's heart.  John wisely opts to use the lyrics for imagery for much of the album and this serves to add to the dreamy quality of the album as a whole.  Despite the release of several albums, I think this one is still his best effort to date.    The SACD version of the album is very nice icing on the cake, so to speak, because the plain CD version already had excellent sound quality.  What stands out about the sound quality and production value in both CD & SACD versions is the relatively uncompressed dynamics of the tracks and the reproduction of nuances like John's breathy vocals and the subtle guitar plucking.  This is a real refreshing rarity these days when virtually all new pop releases are so heavily compressed and fatiguing that I can't listen for more than five minutes at a time.  Unfortunately, great sound quality for mainstream music releases seem to be the exception rather than the rule.  Twenty plus years ago, we had dynamic and punchy sounding pop music but now we regressed into the dark ages.
B00102F5WK|5.0|Rendition sheds light on post-9/11 practices aimed at combating terrorism. An Egyptian-born man is apprehended as he returns to the United States following a trip to South Africa only to be transported to a secret location in Egypt where the torture begins. The film deals with several stories as they unfold simantineously and by the end of the movie everything falls into place.  Although Reese Witherspoon, Meryl Streep, Omar Metwally and most of the rest of the cast carry out their performances well, Yigal Naor primarily and Peter Saarsgard secondarily steal the show. On the down side, I am not a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal and subsequently I did not appreciate his being in this movie.   The plot, the setting, the dialogues, and the music, are all very good.  In short, Rendition is a movie definitely worth watching if you are in the mood for a good political thriller. 4.5 Stars
0385340990|4.0|This novel of letters captures life on a British Island during the Nazi occupation of World War II. After the war, a young female author from London begins to correspond with people on the island of Guernsey, and gets drawn into their lives during the war (when their literary society was formed) and after. I had to work hard through the first half of the book trying to distinguish the many characters who were writing. Halfway through the book, as a plot began to develop and the main characters emerged, this novel paid me back for my early efforts. This \\"feel good\\" novel does capture life on the island of Guernsey and the people who live there. I did get totally drawn into that world, and thoroughly enjoyed it. This book tries to capture many things: love of literature, the brutality and heroism in war, romance, and the closeness of a rural community in another era. It succeeds on all these fronts.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This an awesome album, it has all of his best known songs from 1955-2002, which unlike the (essential johnny cash) this features his hits with american recordings, this is by far the best cd to buy. Highly recommended.

0380977788|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Neil Gaiman and while I didn't like this quite as much as the other books of his that I've read (like SANDMAN, STARDUST, and AMERICAN GODS), this was a truly eerie story.  From the time that my daughter was a few months old until she was 9 and decided that she no longer needed to be read to (she was devouring Robert Jordan novels by this time) I loved nothing so much as reading her stories.  CORALINE was published well after the time that I was banned from reading to her, so we never had the chance, but this is a book that I believe would have truly served the purpose.  The rhythm of the prose almost demands that it be read outloud.  So while I was not as enthralled by this as much as I have been by other Gaiman books, I believe it would have been an outstanding read aloud book.<br /><br />What impresses me about nearly all of Gaiman's work is his deep and instictive sense of what myth and story is all about.  George Lucas has striven unsuccessfully to embrace primal myth and archetypes, but is so formulaic a fashion that his later films seem stiff and self-conscious.  They lack the kind of heart that Gaiman's best work radiates.  Gaiman explores in this book the most basic fears that young children experience, such as the alienation of moving into a new place, of perceived neglect by their parents, the threat of a neighorhood that one does not know, the fear of separation from parents.  And some of the imagery in Coraline's nightmare experience is haunting, such as the eyes of her other mother and other father consisting of sewn on buttons, or the dogs in the theater that are transformed into dog bats.  Over and over again Gaiman has precisely the right creative touch in these matters.<br /><br />Another reason that I would have loved to have been able to read this to my daughter when she was young is that it presents a perfectly ordinary little girl in a heroic light.  Coraline has no special powers or abilities.  She simply has to be courageous.  It is inconceivable to me that any young girl would not find her story riveting.<br /><br />This is the first of four Neil Gaiman books that I plan on reading on my vacation.  The next three will be THE GRAVEYARD BOOK, THE ANANSI BOYS, and NEVERWHERE, in that order.  I decided for once to read books that I wanted to read, instead of books that I felt I needed to read for one or another project.vable to me that any young girl would not find her story riveting.

B001O5LVPI|5.0|The 42nd animated film in the Disney library, \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" is a very unique film. Slightly darker than what you would expect, dealing with some adult issues, it strays from the typical upbeat love story that you'd expect with princesses and fairies. The story is about an artificial alien, Stitch, created illegally by Dr. Jumba Jookiba (voice of David Ogden Stiers). Programmed to be aggressive and destructive, Stitch is banished to an asteroid. He escapes his captors, stealing a vehicle and heads to Earth. Jumba is sent by the Grand Councilwoman to quietly retrieve him in exchange for Jumba's pardon.<br /><br />Stitch is mistaken for a dog and put in a Hawaiian animal rescue shelter. Meanwhile, Lilo (Daveigh Chase) is a little girl living with her older sister Nani (Tia Carrere) since their parents were recently killed in a car accident. Nani is struggling with keeping a job and tending to Lilo, who is not much different from Stitch: unable to make friends and lonely, Lilo is also full of uncontrolled and explosive anger. Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames), an intimidating social worker who looks more like an agent from \\"Men in Black,\\" warns Nani that she is in danger of losing Lilo if she is not able to get the situation under control. Attempting to get Lilo a pet for companionship, Nani takes Lilo to the shelter. Lilo immediately falls for Stitch, who is on his best behavior so that he can escape Jumba.<br /><br />Stitch's destructive outbursts cause more trouble for Nani, but along the way, through the unconditional love of Lilo, he learns the importance of family. More aliens arrive to capture Stitch, and Lilo must save Stitch while at the same time keep Nani out of trouble from Cobra Bubbles. Exciting chase sequences follow as all of the parties attempt to achieve their missions.<br /><br />The plot may sound a little convoluted, but on film, it definitely isn't. It is full of touching moments; Lilo is obviously hurting from the loss of her parents, and the fact that she is an outcast amongst her peers doesn't help. Stitch, although thoroughly nasty, does show traces of sadness and emotion, especially when he realizes that he doesn't have a family or any history due to the way that he was created. Through Lilo, Stitch is able to have the love and acceptance that he wants. This becomes known to the audience through Lilo's mantra of \\"Nobody gets left behind.\\"<br /><br />The task for making this movie was to create something in the vein of [[ASIN:B000EYK4GW Dumbo (Big Top Edition)]]; a memorable yet simple classic that could be made within a more modest budget. It definitely succeeds. I will caution that for younger children, there is some slightly disturbing material, dealing with the loss of parents and some anger expressed between the 2 sisters. The initial sequences with Stitch on the alien ship can also be a little unsettling as they basically discuss his destruction and remove samples of his fluids. There are a number of violent and destructive parts, dealing with both Lilo & Stitch. With a little adult supervision and explanation, this film quickly steers towards more pleasant territory and can be a great shared family experience. The rich colors of the movie and the watercolor backgrounds really add to the visual experience and captures the beauty of Hawaii.<br /><br />This 2-disc set is a whopper when it comes to extras.<br /><br />Disc One:<br /><br />* Audio Commentary: Featuring Producer Clark Spencer and Directors/Writers Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois.<br /><br />* \\"Your Ohana\\" Music Video: features clips from the movie<br /><br />* Lilo & Stitch Island Adventures Games: 3 different games--Gecko Race, Hamsterviel's Coconut Shell Game, and Hamsterviel's Experiment Match Game.

B000FA5QEK|1.0|So after waiting ten years or so I finally got around to reading \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\". And now I understand why this economy is completely tanked.<br /><br />It's an interesting book, and has some good points, please do not get me wrong. The concept of \\"asset\\" vs \\"liability\\" is excellent and maps well to my philosophy of \\"things that make you money\\" and \\"things that take your money\\". However he has a few fatal flaws:<br /><br />First, real estate is not a \\"sure thing\\". Yes, it's possible for a 1.2 million dollar rental to throw off $5k a month in \\"revenue\\". However is that over a 1 year period, 5 year period, 20 year period? How about when the property is a bust? When the tennants leave and you still have to pay that $800,000 mortgage+insurance+upkeep?<br /><br />The problem with big money leverage moves is that... well you're leveraged. And just as easily can things go down as up. In the above case, you're being \\"paid\\" $5,000 to hold the proverbial bag on a 1.2 million dollar item. If it goes under you could be liable for around a million. How long will it take to have a million in reserves? Ok, let's be more realistic and say half a million assuming a 50% drop in value (like that will ever happen :-) at 5k a month? 16 years. So as long as something bad doesn't happen in 16 years, you're fine. Of course that is assuming you're putting all of the 5k a month away and not oh say treat it as cash flow....<br /><br />No wonder everyone's \\"broke\\" out there these days. Oh well.<br /><br />Now you get the picture: It's easy to make money when times are going well. It's easy to look like a complete genius and write books degrading others when your particular star is on the rise. But life is more than a 10 year horizon, and a lot of interesting things can happen in 20-30 years. Like um where we are today.<br /><br />So maybe the idea is to think about what the author says in context, and not believe all the puffiness. If you understand that owning a car means having to pay for it every month in fuel, housing, insurance, washing, and so forth  then you can comprehend why taking on liabilities is a bad idea. Likewise if you say bought solar panels you would have an item on your house that poured money every day into your pocket. And at the end of 20 years you could still sell them on ebay.<br /><br />That's an asset. Good luck!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I've had these for over a month and they work great! They feel awesome in your hand and very easy to snap on. A must have for FPS games!!
0316067601|5.0|Being a 'Navy Brat' this book totally captured my heart.  I wish this was required reading for all middle and high schools.  You can't believe the training the Navy Seals go thru, the brotherhood formed is remarkable.  The desperate battle Marcus and his buddies were confronted with in Afghanistan,  four men against an army of terrorist just grabs your very soul to pray for them to win.  I salute all of our Military and support our troops 100%.  Those who are critical of the war effort should walk in his (Marcus) shoes for one day.  They wouldn't survive.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The Dualshock 3 wireless controller makes gaming sooo much better. It feels like a more natural weight compared to the cheap feel of a plain sixaxis controller. The rumble feels completely realistic from the extreme vibration of being blasted with a rocket launcher to the light nudge of being bumped while racing. Sony should have always included the Dualshock 3 instead of waiting like they did. A must have for all ps3 owners.
078322740X|5.0|This is a really cute and romantic movie!  It's almost like good, fun marriage counseling, if there is such a thing! Great date-movie.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Quite simply, the best show on TV as of 2008 and 2009.  Superb in every aspect: writing, acting, direction, cinematography, you name it.  It has been a very, very long time that a show has kept me on the edge of my seat, actually giving me anxiety from the dramatic tension, waiting to see what happens next.  And it's funny too, along with being compassionate enough to break your heart.  An amazing piece of work.  As of today, only 10 episodes of this series have aired so far, but it seems like so many more because it has accomplished more in its short life than most shows do in years.    This DVD set seems a tad overpriced considering there were only seven episodes in the first season, but really a show this good is worth a lot more.  Pick it up if you are at all interested in this show; you will want to watch it from the beginning for maximum effect.
0141380934|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for a baby shower. My friend loved it, especially because it came with a CD version of the book.
B001GQACGO|2.0|Once I read that the biggest difference between this outing and the other Beyonce outings is that Beyonce either wrote, co-wrote, produced, or co-produced every single one of the songs on this CD (while that's not so with her previous two outings), I sighed a big \\"Oh.\\"  As in, that explains everything.  Miss B did her thing on Dangerously In Love; she did it just as well with B'Day, but I Am...Sasha Fierce has something missing from it.    Supposedly, this CD is supposed to be the more revelatory and honest of her three CDs since it's all her.  So why does the CD sound so bland, then?  With the exception of \\"If I Were a Boy,\\" which is simply beautiful -- but is actually taken from an up-and-coming singer named BC Jean, who sounds better singing it -- the rest of the ballads on the \\"I Am...\\" side are either Beyonce screaming unintelligibly at the far reaches of her vocal range (\\"Halo,\\" which quite frankly to be sounds awful) or simply blends into the background like elevator music.  Her ballads from her first albums (like \\"Speechless\\" and \\"Me, Myself, and I\\" from the first one and \\"Resentment\\" and \\"Irreplaceable\\" on the second) evoke much more meaning.    And the \\"Sasha Fierce\\" side is what is -- commercially usable music.  You can't move anywhere without hearing a Beyonce song at least twice -- I can hear 2 or 3 in an hour of radio play.  \\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\\" is a great dance track and even hearing it every day for weeks on end because of my roommate's obsession didn't bang the song out of my favor, but that \\"Diva\\" song is like nails on a chalkboard (it makes little sense, and has nothing special about it except excessive bass) and the rest of the tracks...fade into the background.  \\"Radio\\" is nice.    All in all, maybe Beyonce needs to stick to having other people write her tracks for her.
B00001ODGR|3.0|Good Styx video if you can stomach Dennis DeYoung. This video is pretty much Dennis trying to convince everybody that he IS Styx. He pretty much takes credit for the band's success during the intro to \\"Lady\\" and acts as if without him Shaw and Young and Panozzo would all be flipping burgers. DeYoung is a cornball the whole time, waving his fist, pumping his arms, making faces at the camera. It's a good laugh really. Too bad the band's music had to take a backseat to this man's ego.
B000099T2L|4.0|I write this review retrospectively, feeling a bit nostalgic for the music I used to listen to in high school...anyway, I got the first Destiny's Child CD when it first came out and I didn't even think they would last, much less that the \\"lead singer\\" (which I didn't even know was the lead -- the positioning on the first CD makes LaTavia look like the lead!) would blow up to be in everyone's face like she is now.    And that brings me to my review.  The sweetest thing about this CD was that it WASN'T in your face, not quite like B'Day got to be and nothing like I Am...Sasha Fierce is now.  The quality of the songs was better, Beyonce kept her voice sweet and lovely, there wasn't a whole lot of filler but she wasn't trying to make every single song on the CD a single.    Pretty much the entire first half of the album is great -- I really love \\"Hip Hop Star,\\" \\"Naughty Girl,\\" and \\"Me, Myself, and I,\\" despite me not liking singles that much.  Beyonce really shows the quality of her voice in \\"Speechless\\" -- it's such a sultry, sexy song and quintessentially Beyonce.  \\"Gift From Virgo\\" is also a beautiful, sweet tribute to her lover (who was even then suspected of being Jay-Z).    If Miss B would just go back to doing music like this...
B000HEWEDK|5.0|If you like '50s sci-fi, then you will like _Forbidden Planet_.  Not only is it simply good entertainment, it works hard at integrating the genre-specific with broader movie qualities, and thus stands tall and proud in the genre.  Science-fiction gimmics and gadgetry do not drive the movie; rather the human interactions do (although some may be a bit two-dimensional), so you're likely to find it to have dramatic qualities, in addition to genre credentials.  That's not to say that the effects are inconsequential--they're not, and they're often quite good.  You'll recognize a number of things copied by later movies (even the later movies' \\"wow\\" scenes), which will ratify the legitimacy of the \\"old\\" stuff in comparison to the \\"new,\\" which so often gets a free pass based on its high-tech abilities.    If you get the Two-Disc Special Addition, you'll also get _The Invisible Boy_, which you'll probably find tolerable, even enjoyable, but not on a par with _Forbidden Planet_.  It's really a vehicle for Robby the Robot.  Nostalgia yes, awards no.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|The first Bond film that is a direct sequel to its predecessor, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" was criticized for what it wasn't--it deviates from the formula established with the Sean Connery films and refined through to the Pierce Brosnan films. \\"Quantum of Solace\\" features a more feral Bond just as its predecessor did. It's also the first Bond film in quite some time to run under 120 minutes and it's a very good one if taken on its own terms.<br /><br />First, the Blu-ray looks exceptionally good with a sharp, crisp transfer and it hasn't been overprocessed so the film grain has been largely maintained. The 5.1 high def audio mix is spectacular and will give your system a complete work out.<br /><br />The \\"special features\\" are largely underwhelming and hint that there will probably be a double dip--there's no commentary track and the featurettes are largely recycled from the website for the film from when it was released. In that regard MGM and Fox have done a largely disappointing job when it comes to arming this Blu-ray to the teeth.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a very good Bond outing and although signficantly different in many respects when compared to the last couple of Bond films, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is a tightly plotted action film that nicely concludes the story set up in \\"Casino Royale\\" from three years ago.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the special features which combined run less than 50 minutes but the feature film itself receives a stellar transfer.<br /><br />Bond (Daniel Craig)brings Mr. White to \\"M\\" (Judi Densch)so White can be interrogated about the secret organization Quantum. When one of \\"M\\"'s men betrays her and tries to kill her, Bond and help White escape. 007 uncovers a plot in Bolivia masterminded by Mr. Greene who, on the surface, appears to be an ecologically minded businessman.<br /><br />4 stars for the film and transfer, 2 stars for the special features
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|How can you review Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight\\" without starting with Heath Ledger?  Not only does Ledger, as the Joker, give one of the best performances ever in a \\"comic book movie,\\" he does so with perhaps one of CB's greatest villains and in his final complete film performance?  The Joker has been hammed up for decades in the \\"Batman\\" TV series, comics, and movies, but Ledger turns the character into something completely sinister and original . . . we've seen this character a thousand times, but we've never seen this before.    Ledger's Joker is an agent of chaos - all he wants is to mess with the established order, to be a burr under civilization's saddle.  Money is a mere tool to buy dynamite, bullets, and stupid henchmen, and as the Joker says, \\"they come cheap.\\"  This Joker is not going to play silly games just to leave a calling card - he wants nothing more than to take down the best and brightest civilization has to offer.    Interestingly, the Joker (and the filmmakers) choose to make the best and the brightest neither Bruce Wayne or the Batman, but instead Harvey Dent (played perfectly by Aaron Eckhart), Gotham's crusading district attorney.  Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale, grimly charismatic as always) sees Dent as his means to return to a normal life - with Dent cleaning up the streets, the city won't need Batman any more.  And if he gives up the mask, he can marry sweetheart Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, a welcome replacement for Katie Holmes).     The fact that Dawes may be in love with Dent doesn't really play into Wayne's plans at first . . . but eventually it does.    While Wayne's affairs of the heart are playing out, the Joker is consolidating his power on Gotham's crime scene.  Using ingenious means only available to the criminally insane, the Joker unites the various crime families in an effort to bring down the Batman.  Not necessarily kill - the Joker has something far more sinister up his sleeve.  It's no surprise that every time the Joker looms on screen, the soundtrack cranks up a creepy, grinding sound that is only tangentially related to music, but sets the perfect tone for this madcap murderer.    This excellent plot gives plenty of opportunities for Nolan to set up fantastic action scenes in the streets of Gotham (actually Chicago, a nice replacement for New York).  Nolan also gives plenty of opportunities for the stellar cast - that also includes Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and the sainted Morgan Freeman - to do some serious acting.       Parents should be warned - if you're looking for a second movie for a super-hero double feature for the kiddies to go alongside \\"Ironman,\\" you should probably watch this movie first without your kids around.  While \\"Ironman\\" goes for the \\"safe\\" kind of cartoonish violence, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is grim stuff and definitely not for every kid.  My older daughter is only 5, and while she's enjoyed many PG movies, I won't let her anywhere near this one.  This is not a criticism - just an acknowledgement that \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a movie where the villains play hardball.    The superhero movie is definitely in a Golden Age, and \\"The Dark Knight\\" belongs on the list of Great Comic Book Movies ever.
B001LV5OOY|5.0|What an incredible album...I had the import of this since January and haven't stopped listening to it.  Very dark and mysterious at times, like a window into a twisted soul.  It hints at goth and electronica but never deviates from true rock music.  Nothing sounds corny or contrived.  This really is THE rock album of 2009.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This video is an absolute joy--totally entertaining, and extra fun when you view the sing-a-long version! I'm in my 50's and I viewed it with a couple of 20ish gals, and we all had a ball! Great for all ages...
B001R4MEYS|4.0|I think for this album Mastodon wrote about 10,000 guitar riffs, and used 9500 of them.  Maybe to Mastodon guitar riffs are like snowflakes. Maybe Mastodon was snowed in for the winter and wrote a guitar riff for each snowflake that they saw.  And then smoked some ganja for every snowflake they saw, and arranged a masterpiece of an album. Maybe they should be called Masterdon.    Not as heavy as their previous outings, like Leviathan, or Blood Mountain. They are really exploring what it takes to be Mastodon, and showing us that Mastodon do things on their own terms.  But I think that we all saw this coming, right? I think it sounds totally natural coming from them, and that there was no question at all about what they were going to do on this album, BLOW OUR MINDS!!! ok? My brains are litteraly all over the inside of my car. Remember that scene in Pulp Fiction when John Travolta as Vincent Vega shoots the guy in the backseat of his car? Thats what I look like right now.     Thanks Mastodon
B001PPLIEQ|2.0|I was not a Bond fan prior to Casino Royale. However I loved it and thought Daniel Craig was excellent. I was looking forward to QOS and boy was I disappointed. Weak script, lousy pacing, silly villains and mindless action sequence after mindless action sequence. What a letdown. This was a step backward in my opinion for the series. Casino Royale was a shot in the arm for an ailing franchise. If QOS is a sign of what's to come, I won't be along for the ride.
B00007LTIC|4.0|Probably their last astounding release, and not without some creeping, finely implemented pop sensibilities coming into the fore, GFTO remains must-have for any fans of these progfathers, paying for itself alone with the bittersweet final track. In a sad way, \\"Awaken\\" put the grand compositional skills for one of the last great rock group composers to sleep.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Saw her live in Vegas, it brought me back to the real thing.  Very happy I bought this item.
B000002J23|3.0|3 1/2    Quite solid, possibly maligned mid-career release at the turn of the 80's was a noteworthy effort to pump new blood into stalling creativity but cannot hold the palpable virtuosic synergy present prior, even if it admirably tries.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I was extremely pleased with my purchase.  It arrived much sooner than I expected, and was in great condition.  I couldn't be more pleased.
B00000I9MK|3.0|Oft-cited debut can't live up to classic status (lacking more intricate songwriting that was to come) but can be seen as the head-turning, prog-folk, arrangement-heavy group's official entering statement- one whose retro strumming would not be lost upon hipsters worldwide.
0439023483|5.0|I was addicted to the story from just the first few pages (and that never happens to me).  I was also very humbled by this story.  Makes me feel grateful for what relatively little I have in my life. A lesson many children need to learn. I found myself yearning for more...can't wait until the sequel!    This book is great for adults, so don't let the YA classification deter you from reading this book!  I also don't think it was too brutal for the YA audience - I would rate it PG-13 with strong parental caution.
141694737X|5.0|This book is a favorite both for baby and for Mom. My 13 month old insists on reading it every evening. The illustrations are great and the flaps are sturdy and offer a variety of lifting versus pulling down or opening out.     If I could improve one thing it would be to have the animals named in the text.     Overall a great book.
0375826726|5.0|It is all you can expect and more.  I dont' want to give anything away.  You will love 3 as much as you loved the other 2
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is by far the best/most underrated sitcom/show on T.V.  Very smart! Laugh-out-loud funny!  Unlike most \\"sit-com's\\", you are guaranteed to \\"laugh-out-loud\\" a few times during each and every episode. Terrific ensemble cast and tremendous writing.  Their should definitely be numerous award nominations and hopefully wins for acting, writing, ensemble cast, etc.  A treat!
B001FBSMF8|3.0|If you change your style and try to get a differnet crowd thats cool. But Chris made a bad choice by ending Soundgarden then went solo which really was great for a moment going to Audioslave just to leave and go solo. I think if your going to revive your career just go back to Soundgarden and keep rockin'
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|I recently bought the 3-disc version of the movie, after reading here that it was a better value.    Well, it's true. The extras were great! The entire script, tons of photo galleries, and three commentaries made it worth going out of my way to find this version. Not to mention the  \\"ships\\" that appear on screen to lead you to behind the scenes footage. The crews' video is unexpectedly funny.    A few complaints to consider though:  *There are two discs (packed with extras) to the film itself, so expect to have to change to disc two to finish the movie. A little disruptive if you get very involved in the plot line.  *Watching the deleted scenes definitely adds a new level to the film, but there is no way to integrate them into play time. You have to watch them alone, or not at all--they're stranded on disc three.  *I would have loved to have seen a documentary on here. While the Fox special is featured, it would have been nice to seen something from History Channel or Discovery to add a little weight, and not just Fox sponsored material.     This is a great way to see the film if you're like me, and kept watching it for years wondering what the fuss was about. The added extras give new dimension to the movie, and make it the version to own.
B001F290E4|4.0|This is a really good, easy listening album. Some of the songs were a little older than I was looking for, but his voice is great to listen to any time!!
0061091480|5.0|This book is a classic in the self-help psychology world.  My mother was a psychiatric nurse in the alcoholism/addiction treatment unit at a major metropolitan DC area hospital back in the late 70s/early 80s.  They MADE the entire staff in the treatment unit read this book.  I read it too, and it is great!  Everyone should read this book!  It really will help you identify a lot of dysfunctional thinking and attitudes that you carry around with you.  I even know of a person who was depressed whose depression disappeared after reading this book!  It is THAT good!
B001PPF12Q|2.0|I cannot believe that the 3 Radiohead \\"Collector's Edition\\" titles are NOT remastered. CD remastering technology has come a long way since these CDs were initially released. OK Computer is twelve years old! It would have been nice to hear these titles with improved sound quality, but instead EMI (assumably with the band's consent) have just repackaged the same CDs with the various B-sides.<br /><br />To be fair, the price is good versus having to buy all the EPs and singles to get these tracks. But these days, when classic albums are reissued, it is expected that they are remastered (The Cure, Depeche Mode, New Order, Pearl Jam, etc.)<br /><br />These non-remastered titles just make Radiohead look as out of touch as The Beatles.
1438242816|5.0|This has to be one of my absolute favorite books of all time. I love the characters who are all written exceptionally well. I love the language and Austen's style. I love the book.<br /><br />I've read it 4 times including the first, which was less than a year ago. Despite that, I still dislike reading certain scenes in public because they have me laughing or smiling like an idiot. At one point, I was reading, and I had to shut the book grinning like an idiot to walk around a lose some of my pent up energy.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet is an intelligent character. But she has her flaws. She thinks highly of herself and her wit, and she forgets that even she can make a mistake. Jane is the kindest character in the book, and more gentle-hearted than anyone I know. But it works with her and I have no problems relating to her. Darcy is a proud, shy man who dislikes social situations. But he is caring, just, and thoughtful. Bingly is his exact opposite.<br /><br />I should probably stop describing the characters. But they are what make this book a classic. Jane Austen is a master of characterization. I can relate to them centuries later despite living in a completely different country and culture. Elizabeth and Darcy leave me grinning like an idiot and distracted for days after I am done reading the book. Obviously, it's why I'm posting this review nearly a week after I finished reading it for the fourth time in full!<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone who enjoys a good romance, and even those who don't.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|A movie on this subject has to either suspend belief or become real and in this case this movie became believable.  The ending was what really made this a classic and sold me although all through you could feel that this could have happened.
0060558121|4.0|Neil Gaiman, whose Sandman series of comics had already cemented his place in the Western Cannon, wrote this book a few years back and it is a triumph. Gaiman is not one to rest on his laurels as so many more authors before him have done after completing such a monumental work. He is not one to completely shun what has made him famous, in fact, he seems almost proud of the concept of the collective mythology that ties all of us together. I kept on expecting him to put in a cameo by one of the endless, but I think that would have been too much. Although some of the gods who poped up in Sandman do show up here.<br />  As a novel it works very well. There are characters that any reader should love and a denouement that comes about before the reader knows what hit him. Along with some terrific set pieces. It is, in some ways a classic English novel, set in America. It has that same kind of tight narrative and a structure that is barely apparent that the Brits are so notorious for.<br />  Also the book is one hell of a page turner and funny. too. Highly recommended.
B0000075WM|5.0|I love this CD and even though the addresses got mixed up the store called me personally to find out why I had to change the address.  Then they discovered a small flaw in the paper part of the cd and gave me two other cds to make up for it. I would buy from this company again and again!! Great CD and great people
B001FXCE46|5.0|This album is fantastic and can be played on a loop for 2 weeks without getting bored (I've pretty much done it).  The soul in his voice and in this music gets inside of you and just makes for a great mood.  If you get the chance, BUY THIS CD.  You will not regret it.
1427206031|4.0|I don't often read historical fiction as a genre, but this item intrigued me. I am very happy I experienced it! I am a person who would not often describe myself as daring, valiant or steadfast, but find those qualities very worthy of attaining. I suppose we all have moments of them, in our own small way, but this is different. This book celebrates George Mallory, emphasizing those qualities of tenaciousness and bravery. I think most readers understand that it is fictionalized, but I don't think it is a problem, as long as we know that it isn't being peddled as absolute truth. Sometimes stories are better this way, to raise a person up, to respect and remember them in a different way...sometimes I think we get too much truth and not enough legend.
B001O4FXY4|4.0|This is a great cd that just makes you feel good.  Derek has a great voice and creates music you can bob your head to regardless.  One of the better albums he has

So, please release the next Dvd/Blu-Ray or whatever you will release with a label as original only if it is original! Try not to release anything near original! Do, or do not, there is no try!

B001661RC2|4.0|I have to say that I love the Black Keys and this cd is no exception.  There are songs on this album that I cannot get enough of.  that being said there are just a couple that I'm not too keen on.  But, I respect the way they did even the songs I do not like.  The Black Keys are endlessly original and pay tribut to all the true rock bands of the past.  This is truly uninhibited Rock n Roll.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I became a Yes fan in my late teens, I am now 49. A friend of mine had some of their albums and turned me on to the progressive rock charms of Yes. I still listen to classics albums such as \\"Close to the Edge\\" and \\"Fragile\\" from time to time. I was excited to learn that they had video recorded a concert event and recently released it. The other night I sat down and watched the concert in it's entirety and man was I amazed. Jon Anderson's vocals were just as powerful as ever. Steve Howe's guitar prowess is still intact, Chris Squire is still the incredible bass player I learned to love many years ago, and Alan White can still play those skins baby. Although the members of Yes have aged, their musical performance still has a marked vitality that continues to charm. The addition of the European Festival Orchestra offered an incredible enhancement to the live experience that a mere review cannot express. Songs to watch for are: \\"Starship Troopers\\", \\"And You and I\\", \\"Long Distance Run Around\\", and \\"Roundabout\\". The DVD is a must have for any Yes fan or fan of progressive rock music in general. Watch and listen to the masters.
B000000ORE|5.0|Great seller, very fast shipping and in great condition. When buying cds again this is the seller I will use!
B000FFJYB6|3.0|I thought the acting, script and costuming were all good,<br />it is just the subject has been played to death for over 50 years now.<br />I watched Lassie and Rin Tin Tin in the movies and on TV until<br />I just lost interest in another dog and boy after Old Yeller.<br />I guess I'm a cat kind of person:<br />they kind of come at go and you have to take them as they are.<br />You can't get them to do much in the way of tricks...
B001F7MSFM|4.0|Being a geek in good standing, I was really excited when HellBoy made its way to film. It is normal for the second or third installment of a series to be somewhat of a let down, but that is not the case here. The story was great. It was a perfect mix of modern and fairy tale themes. The imagery was beautiful. And it left a wonderful cliffhanger for a third installment.

B000YJ54DU|4.0|I read a lot of negative reviews on number 12; I've read all the others; some of the others I've read twice because I go through them so quickly I can't remember if I read them.    Reacher is Reacher. The negative reviews are unwarranted. Reacher is still traveling with his toothbrush and busting up the bad guys. I did not have a problem with any of the negative reviewers supposed political issues or more covert (I intuit) issues with Reacher's religious beliefs.    Just same old Reacher; nothing the matter with that, I'll keep buying them although I thought this one was pricey. I read it on our new Kindle2, which is a way cool device by the way; not something Reacher would ever own or pretend to understand; but good on the road, great little tool, just like Reacher's toothbrush, wouldn't leave home without it.

0688152023|5.0|I have been using exercises from this book for over ten years and it really works on top of cardio-based excercise, as i do such as swimming and fast walking in the hills. I am 42 and have essentially the same body as when I was 18 - though more toned. I attribute it to this book along with good diet and the cardio I have always done since I was a kid. I have been using the book from memory since I loaned it out many years ago, but just ordered a used copy so I can learn more exercises - I only learned about half. Definitely good for toning! I do them every other day, day in day out.

B001F12J3Y|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOVIES YOU CAN SIT BACK AND FEEL THAT YOU IN THE MOVIE BECAUSE OF THE ORIGIN OF THE MOVIE, THE DEPTH OF THE MOVIE. ALL THAT TIME THE ACTORS, PRODUCERS, CONSULTANTS, AND DIRECTOR PUT IN. IT'S ALL ABOUT BELIEVING ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! AND THE NATURE OF CHRISTMAS IS BEAUTIFUL. ALL THE LOVE FROM EVERY SINGLE PERSON IS PRECIOUS. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES, AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT'S ON BLU - RAY.
B00005NGAL|5.0|I love the musical and purchased this because of the special features. Sadly, they were not that great.   If you want the enjoyment of the musical you will get it in spades!!   However, I'd suggest getting the one disc, they aren't that much different.
630542845X|5.0|The movie Powder is a truly amazing movie it does have some flaws but the message and the depth of the movie truly out does the flaws. The movie was released in 1994 a year after Jurassic Park Jeff Goldblum in my mind did his best work in this movie. The movie is based around a young boy who has a skin problem where he has no pigmintation and who is smarter then albert Einstein supposedly. The police come to the house to find that his grandparents are dead. and they believe they just died of natural causes. Downstairs lives there grandchild who everyone thinks is a freak just because of the color of his skin. Which goes into deeper depth of racial conflicts. They take him from his house to put him into schooling because they see of his inteligence. Threw the whole movie the only thing Powder wants to do is go back to his farm house.<br /><br />  During Powders first day of school he is in lunch and the Aka: Bullies come to pick on him and Powder shows his first true showings of power by putting all the metal in the room together and making a spoon dance across the table leaving the whole room in shock and silence. You soon come to find out that the Police Sergent has a wife who is sick and slowly fading and how him and his son have fallin out of touch.<br /><br />  Powder and his class go on a hiking trip soon to find out that one of the police officers and a bunch of his classmates went up to the trails to hunt,  when powder hears gunfire and see's a deer slowly dieing he grabs the arm of the officer and the neck of the dear showing the officer what death really is like changing the officer for good, where he does not wanna go hunting anymore.<br /><br />  The Movie has so much going on and is so deep it truly is a amazing movie. the two must touching scenes in the movie is when powder communicates what the sergents wife wants to tell him and he breaks down when she dies, His son shows up only to know that she has died and there is a deep emotional scene when the son and father embrass for the first time.  The other deep Scene is at the end of the Movie when Powder finally gets back to his orignal home and he takes off into the field and Jeff Goldblum and everybody else is following him and he is getting hit by lightening and he disappears and everyone feels him around them... The scenes are even made deeper by the music composed by Jerry Goldsmith Who probably did some of his best music on this and is not known for this movie. It was a very under rated movie a must see!ass for the first time.

B001MYIXAC|2.0|It's now well documented-that Magnolia/Magnet did NOT use the original theatrical subtitles, but simplified, inferior ones of their own devising:    [...]    Magnolia/Magnet has promised to re-release with the original subtitles, but until Amazon changes \\"English\\" to \\"English (theatrical)\\" in the subtitles available, better steer clear of this as a vampire would a roomful of cats.    By the way, if you're one of those who pre-ordered to get this DVD as soon as possible, you'll either need to pony up for the re-release or learn Swedish -- Magnolia/Magnet has refused to exchange the first release for the new one.
B001AP11L6|5.0|There have alread been plenty of reviews on this one, so I'll just mention a few things. This cd contains 14 great songs. Some highlights include: \\"Seven Nation Army\\", \\"Ball & Biscuit\\", \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\", \\"Little Acorns\\", \\"Girl You Have No Faith in Medicine\\", and \\"Well it's True That we Love one Another\\" (with guest vocalist - Holly Golighty.    Jack is a great guitar player, and Meg really pounds those drums!!! This is a great CD, and I recommend it. Thanks!!!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|There are those that say the show has destroyed the vision of the books, but I heartily disagree.<br /><br />I read all the books as they come out, and I LOVED the series.  Yes, I do refer to it as my \\"Vampire Porn\\", but the books weren't exactly PG-13, or even R.  I feel that the show has done an excellent job of following of the main plot, it just added several things in to round out the storyline.  It is 13 hours of TV, if you didn't add in some extra stuff, it wouldn't last that long.  Also, the story does a better job of making the supporting characters more real.  Yes, I know that Tara and Lafayette really aren't prominently featured in the books, but on the show they are fascinating characters with a life all their own.  Actually, they were my favorite characters on the show.<br /><br />Honestly, after going back and re-reading the Sookie novels, you can see that the first two or three really aren't that well written.  The premise and the story is great, but the delivery is somewhat elementary.  With the flatness of some of the characters, it is no wonder that the storyline needed to be \\"juiced-up\\" to not seem trite.<br /><br />The main plot of the novel remains intact, and the 1st season of the show wraps up even with the end of the 1st book in the series, plus a little teaser of the 2nd books plot.  Dare we hope that HBO will devote a season to each novel?  With HBO's track record of canceling shows, I seriously doubt it, but I plan on watching for as long as I can.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|This is another great CD from the White Stripes. It contains 13 great songs.

B00008J2R1|2.0|I'm a hardcore Oasis fan. I run the website[..]. I just listed to the SACD of this for the first time today after owning the disc itself for over 5 years, after I FINALLY got a SACD player.    I must say, I am extremely disappointed in this SACD. Sure, some sounds are separated to different 5.1 channels like they should be, but like one of the other reviewers stated, the vocal is all over the place. It almost sounds like there is an echo or that you are listening to the album live. In fact, some songs are decent, but others are just horrible. The songs where Noel sings tend to be the better ones.    And by the way, the SACD down-mixed MP3's of the album floating around on the internet sound NOTHING like the actual SACD. The MP3s actually sound better, not kidding you.    I love Oasis, but Sony screwed this one up. Sorry folks! I am not recommending this to buy.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|QUANTUM OF SOLACE<br /><br />**** ½ Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- November 14th, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 106-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- PG-13<br /><br />Screenplay- Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis & Robert Wade<br /><br />Director- Marc Forster<br /><br />Starring- Daniel Craig, Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Giancarlo Giannini, Gemma Arterton with Jeffrey Wright and Judi Dench as M<br /><br />Quantum of Solace is the 22nd film in the Bond franchise and is the first direct sequel of the series. If you haven't seen Casino Royale I'd highly recommend you see that before this one since you might be a bit lost while you can still enjoy Quantum of Solace seeing the previous one would be wise. Casino Royale was the re-launch of the series and Daniel Craig was the new James Bond. A lot of people were unsure at first about Daniel Craig, but many hailed him as the best James Bond and Casino Royale was hailed as one of the best films of the series. Quantum of Solace as received some mixed reviews from the Bond fanatics.<br /><br />While I do enjoy the Bond movies I'm more of a casual fan, but I gotta be honest I thought Quantum of Solace was excellent. Actually I liked it slightly more than Casino Royale. While I'd say Casino Royale was the overall better movie my only complaint was I felt it was a little too long and it started to get a little sluggish with the pacing at times. I still liked the movie a lot, but just felt it was a little longer than need be. Like I said I'm more of a casual fan, but Casino Royale really got me excited about the Bond movies and Quantum of Solace for me didn't disappoint at all. The running of this movie was a lot shorter and I felt it benefited from that since I didn't find it to drag at all.<br /><br />The screenplay by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis & Robert Wade was overall very well written, but I do feel the plot could have been set up a bit better; the only other problem I had were the villains and I had the same problem with Casino Royale as well. The Bond flicks are known for their villains and I just felt in the last two of the series the villains were under developed and a bit forgettable as well. The rest of the characters were fairly decent. Bond and M are the best written and I really like the new direction the James Bond character has gone. Overall the script was solid, but I felt the plot structure could have been a bit better.<br /><br />Director Marc Forster has gotten some mixed reviews from the fans, but I thought he did a great job for the most part. The pacing of the film is excellent and there are plenty of action sequences to keep the viewer entertained. The biggest complaint Quantum of Solace has gotten is for the use of the shaky cam, but it really wasn't bad at all. You can actually see what's happening and I wouldn't say Forster uses the shaky cam, but there is camera movement. Forster's choice of quick edits though is suspect. While I didn't dislike it as many seemed to that would be my only problem, but don't worry it's not like the Saw flicks or anything. But Marc Forster does a great job with the action scenes, which in my opinion are some of the best of the series.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace gets off to a quick start with the very first scene being an action scene and I thought it was great, that's where the quick edits really come in, but it wasn't bad and I felt the scene was exciting and well done. The rest of the action scenes are excellent and thrilling. Again I'm more of a casual fan so I suppose my opinion won't hold as much weight as the more hardcore fans, but I don't really understand why this has gotten so many mixed reviews. Forster does a bang up job and creates some memorable action scenes.<br /><br />In my opinion Daniel Craig is the best James Bond to date, while there are still some traits of the old James Bond, this Bond is a bit darker, grittier and angrier and that's why Craig is my favorite Bond. While Daniel Craig's Bond isn't as charismatic as thepast he really isn't meant to be. I like the darker and colder edge Daniel Craig brings to Bond. Some people compare the new Bond to Jason Bourne and even Jack Bauer and I can see why. But again I like the darker and angrier Bond and Daniel Craig is brilliant in the role. Every time I write a review for an action movie my complaint is always the action star really lacks compared to the past ones, but Daniel Craig has all the makings of the next great action superstar. In an era of really poor action stars and the good ones like Jason Statham doing really poor flicks Daniel Craig is getting it done and getting it done the right way.<br /><br />Olga Kurylenko is the latest Bond girl and she's gotten some mixed reactions, but I actually liked her character. While she does lack a little depth, I thought Olga Kurylenko delivered a mostly solid performance and she is just total hotness. I think I'd rate Olga as possibly the sexiest Bond girl. Judi Dench like always delivers an excellent performance and Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene is solid as the main villain, but he's never really given much to work with.<br /><br />Overall I thought Quantum of Solace was an excellent entry into the Bond franchise the action scenes are great and Daniel Craig was brilliant again in the role of James Bond. While the plot could have been set up better and more could have been done with the villains I have no real complaints and Quantum of Solace makes for a really fun viewing.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release is top notch with a great transfer and awesome sound quality. The features though are decent with some behind the scenes footage. Odds are there will be a better release down the road, but while the features lack the picture and sound more than make up for it.ome people compare the new Bond to Jason Bourne and even Jack Bauer and I can see why.

0316017922|4.0|I was satisfied with the price of the book and the delivery time.  However, this book was a gift and there was a big sticker on the front of it.  When I tried to take it off the cover ripped a bit.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|Come on now really? Don't get me wrong, this film was very good for what it was but a lot of it served absolutely no purpose than to give the action junkie in all of us a quick thrill. Given the cast at the helm, you would be forgiven for believing that this film could be a bit more than a shallow attempt at a dramatic but action packed film. Seriously, the fact that Morgan Freeman was involved should have given this film a 5 star rating from the get-go but even he couldn't save this shallow travesty. I found myself being both annoyed and confused by this film and hopefully, I'll be able to share in my annoyance and confusion towards this film with readers of my review.<br /><br />Wanted is a story about the definitive nobody named Wesley Gibson (Macavoy). His life is repetitive, tedious, monotonous and every other word in the English dictionary that describes it as a bit dull and uneventful. He works in a job he hates for a boss who's the most annoying person in the world, did I mention she's fat? Well that's apparently pretty important for this bitch of a boss stereotype. He has a girlfriend who's cheating on him with his apparent best friend (brief sex scene with this, woo hoo) and his life just seems to be going nowhere. One day while picking up his prescription of anxiety pills, Gibson is confronted by a sexy vixen (a bit too tough for my liking but there you go) we come to know as Fox (Jolie). She tells him that he's the son of one of the greatest assassins that ever lived and the man that killed him is now trying to kill Wesley. Wesley learns that his Father belonged to a fraternity of expert assassins lead by Sloan (Freeman, I know awesome right? Wrong) and it's now Wesley's fate to join and kill the man who killed his father. He is then trained by the fraternity to make him good enough to take the man down.<br /><br />The whole plot in itself is generally that straight forward; it creates an excuse to have a whole lot of blood and bullets, while struggling to instil a sense of depth in our characters. It is straight forward but as is with most films these days, there has to be a \\"clever\\" twist at the end to make you think like enduring the whole painful movie was worth it. The big name actors were cool. Morgan Freeman presented his usual casual authoritative character who will take guff from nobody. Angelina Jolie, although I hate to say it as I do think she's a really good actress. Her only obvious purpose in this movie was to look a bit pretty and arouse the horny teenagers watching this. James Macavoy annoyed the hell out of me, for the first part of the film as he just came across as depressing and his annoying screaming did nothing to quash my hatred.<br /><br />The only genuinely redeeming part of this film tends to be the action and the special effects which are involved in such action sequences as are featured within the film. However, even the action gets to a point at times where I just find it a bit exhausting as a lot of it doesn't make sense. A few examples of it not making sense are in the car chase scene in which a Dodge Viper is trying desperately to escape what I remember to be a Dog Food delivery truck. Now at this point Wesley has become pretty freaked out by all the shooting so makes a run for it. Fox, all angered and sexy jumps in her equally sexy and mechanical Dodge Viper and gets Wesley in the car without stopping and travelling over more than 60 MPH without breaking his legs or some part of his spine. The other part is simply how the Dodge struggles to get away from the truck. I guess this can be explained away by just saying it's a movie, but surely the makers could have done a terminator type chase. They could have had the enemy in a big bad and destructive truck and the victims in a sexy, but not too powerful vehicle.<br /><br />Personally, if you're looking for a movie that isn't a waste of real acting talent, then you should seriously look elsewhere. If you're a pre-pubescent child who doesn't like to think too much and likes to look at pretty women who don't think whilst acting, then this is genuinely the movie for you. It's violent, it's a bit sexy and it's slightly cool in some parts, but for the film fan that likes to think and enjoys a bit of depth to their movie, then this is sincerely something you should stay away from.likes to look at pretty women who don't think whilst acting, then this is genuinely the movie for you.

B001F290E4|5.0|I bought this cd after seeing a brief tv performance by Seal doing the song \\"A change is gonna come\\".  I was so taken by his performance that I wanted more.  In my search, I found that he had a cd containing some of the most wonderful, feel good music of the 60's and 70's.  Songs like It's Alright, Knock on Wood, Free, Stand by Me, If yo don't know me by now...When I got it, I played it over and over.  But the real treat was to see the dvd, now available in bluray.  Wow!!!!  I rate them both 5 star! Based on chioce of songs, audio and video quality.  Prior to ths purchase, I knew nothing of Seals music.  I learned, his usual style had not been classic R&B.  But he is gonna tap into a whole new market if he continues to sing in this R&B style.  I really enjoyed both the cd and dvd.  I only wish they'd had more songs.  There are 12 on the cd, about 9 on the dvd.  But Seal's dvd performance is passionate and soul stirring!  Very well done!
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|Upon first introduction of this film, we know that it is based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The short story tells of a boy born as an old man who, within a few hours can talk and act as such. To avoid embarassment, Benjamins father forces him to dye his hair and play with the local children as a real child. All Benjamin wants to do is read, smoke cigars and have adult conversations as an adult would. Being a short story, you cannot really expect a feature film to be wholly adapted from it, you have to expect massive changes and extensions in order to present a worthwhile and fluid picture to be enjoyed by the masses. What would likely be a film under 1 hour long if it was adapted word for word from the story, we were presented with a treat of a 2 and a half hour story told from the death bed of an aged Cate Blanchett in a pre-hurricane New Orleans hospital.<br /><br />To start off the story we are presented with a metaphorical plot device in the form of a train station clock running backwards, which was made as a hope that it would mean all the dead soldiers of the first world war could come home alive.<br /><br />The story as told to Daisy (Cate Blanchett) by her daughter reading from a diary is that of Benjamin Button, an incredible man whos mother gave her life for and was abandoned by his father (Jason Flemyng). He was born with the appearance of an old man, with all the ailments to boot. He was left on the porch of a New Orleans nursing home to be found by one of the nurses known as Queenie (Taraji P. Nelson), she adopts him and christens him with the name Benjamin. Throughout his early childhood Benjamin is expected to die any day due to the illnesses he has and the way he looks, so is forced to live in the home as if her were one of the elderly relatives.<br /><br />What Queenie starts to become aware of is that as Benjamin gets older, he does not get weaker and sicker as predicted but he's getting younger and fitter. Whilst still looking old but being about the age of 7 he meets a girl who is the daughter of one of the elderly residents known as Daisy. They become friends but cannot be around each other too much due to what he looks like (quite frankly I'm glad they didn't take it any further too early as it was a bit creepy). As Benjamin grows older, he meets his father again, but is not told who he is. He just thinks he is a friendly stranger who offered him a ride and a drink at a bar. Benjamin then moves out to enjoy the adventures of life and is forced to deal with some adult adventures he wouldn't experience if he looked his age.<br /><br />What I can really say about this film with whole hearted honesty is that I absolutely loved it. From start to finish it felt genuine, the maternal love of Queenie for her adopted son came across as authentic thanks to the sublime acting of Taraji. The affair scene with Tilda Swintons character, (although I truly dislike the woman as she looks like someone who was repeatedly hit in the face with a dog by a tramp, and sounds like the queen if she smoked 5 packets of cigarettes a day) is done really well and you get the feeling that Benjamin (Pitt) is genuinely falling for her.<br /><br />Apart from the main plot of Benjamin Button being quite heart wrenching at times, the sub plot of an aged Daisy keeping herself alive until the end of the story is told is quite something. The make up, setting and in some cases special effects all come together well to present a believable setting of a progressive early 1900s New Orleans. The superb performance of Taraji P. Nelson deserves special mention as she now shows the world some genuine acting talent. This has to be Pitts oscar win as for this role it would truly be deserved, however, I would not be surprised if it were highly overshadowed by 2008s biggest blockbusters.he meets a girl who is the daughter of one of the elderly residents known as Daisy.

B001TOD9VI|5.0|For those of you who have seen the classic wrestling documentary \\"Beyond The Mat\\" in which it feature Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts heavily, there is no doubt that Darren Aronofsky will have drawn some inspiration from this real life tragic figure. To those who have already seen this spectacular film, you will recognise the parallels between \\"The Wrestlers\\" main character and Jake. Mickey Rourke can also be compared to the character in regards to his personal life as he tends to get himself into trouble a lot of times with the law and in his relationships.<br /><br />The Plot: Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson is an aged professional wrestler and personal trainwreck with his finger constantly on the self destruct button. He was once the biggest name in wrestling with his biggest match taking place in Madison Square Garden against the Ayatollah 20 years prior to this movies setting. You would think that considering his possible legend status that he would be one of the richest men in the business, in fact he seems to be one of the poorest and the most run down.<br /><br />Living in a trailer park and having stripper being the only person he considers a friend he's pretty much the lowest he can be. Taking part in independent shows to make a quick dollar so he can pay for his drug habit and keep his trailer, he's pushing his body to the absolute limit. One night after taking part in a CZW (Combat Zone Wrestling) event, which is pretty much the hardest of hardcore wrestling he collapses and has a heart attack.<br /><br />Waking up in a hospital and finding out he is just had a heart triple bypass he is told that he can no longer wrestle for the strain would destroy his heart and kill him. Being a man that lives for wrestling he finds this change hard to cope with especially being so lonely. He first tries to seek companionship with his stripper friend and tries to reconcile his relationship with his daughter.<br /><br />The Actors: One thing I will say to praise this film above anything else is its authenticity. Being a fan of independent wrestling, I'm more aware of the backstage trials and tribulations of our more failed wrestlers. Being more aware of how the backstage antics work in the real world of wrestling, I expected this to play agaist this film due to me not expecting it to be truly accurate and quite corny in some respects.<br /><br />I was sorely mistaken and the autenticity of this film is spot on especially with its portrayal of the backstage wrestling world. Mickey Rourke is one of those actors who has a name we all recognise but we're not really sure what he looks like or what movies he's been in. Well that was the case for me anyway, however, this is undoubtedly the film that will put a face to the name and have it stick forever.<br /><br />The daughter role of Stephanie played by Evan Rachel Wood is another highlight of the film considering her small part played. The real Gem of it is Cassidy the stripper played by Marisa Tomei who is one that gains Randys friendship through simply doing her job. What started off as a professional friendship grows into much more as the film develops and randys life falls apart. Mickey is the shining light of this movie for 2009 and should get an oscar nomination for such a stellar performance. He seems to lay it all out there and in his wrestling scenes seems to take part without holding back an ounce.<br /><br />Overall the film is superb, being a wrestling fan I especially enjoyed the wrestling scenes which were filmed at actual live WXW, CZW and Ring of Honor events. Mickeys acting seems to exceed all expectations and the film contained some genuinely heart wrenching moments, especially when he first tries to win back his daughter.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it to anyone who is not just a fan of wrestling, but a fan of movies.

0783225903|4.0|I Love this movie, and the DVD's good and all, but I noticed there's at least one line (a very good, noticeable line) missing, and at least two shots that I've never seen before. Having extra material doesn't bother me at all, but there fact that it was missing stuff made me very angry. I saw this movie at least 10 times before buying the DVD, so I know what I'm talking about. I'm guessing it was just a different cut, but the DVD/its title should be more explanatory and illustrative about that.
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|As I'm sure many of the LoG fans feel, Sacrament was a huge let down.  They spent more time with the production than with the overall song value.  However, this album is exactly what the fans were looking for.  They have gone back to writing awesome songs that make you want to break something and feel good about it.    Good job, fellas.

0312360266|3.0|I really enjoy reading serialized stories and, a friend referred me to this series.  She even loaned me the book.  I have read many vampire series lately and, I found many to be the same story.  When I read the first chapter of this book I thought great another self- absorbed vampire story.  However, as I was introduced to the additional characters and, gain some insight into Zoey's background I found that this series could be interesting.<br /><br />The relationships in the story are well-built.  The characters are formed slowly - allowing for you to adapt and relate to the ongoing changes, as Zoey joins the house of night.  Her life is goes from normal teenage angst to abnormal supernatural teenage angst.  She is marked, her life is turned upside down.  Her soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend, Heath seems unaffected by the facts she is now a fledgling - he doesn't see how that is going to change their relationship.  Her parents (mom and step-monster) are freaked, - so she runs away to her grandmother's lavender farm.  Her grandmother is supportive and takes Zoey to the house of night, so she won't die.  And I won't tell you anymore -- you just need to pick it up & read.  I just finished the 5th book but, decided that I would put in a review for each.
0312539517|4.0|\\"Paths of Glory\\" is an entertaining fictional (speculative) account of George Mallory's attempt to scale Mount Everest.  The book opens with a prologue (1999 setting) that sets the stage for Archer's speculations and also provides readers unaware of Mallory's story enough insight to know where (and mostly how) the story will end.  Archer covers the bulk of Mallory's life beginning in 1892 (Mallory was born in 1886) and finishing with his final ascension of Everest in 1924.  From the beginning, George was interested in adventure and rather precocious.  There are some good schoolboy stories to include his effort/climb to get into Cambridge.  His romance and rapid courtship with wife Ruth is briefly detailed as is his relationship with fellow climbers and co-workers (Mallory was a teacher by occupation) although Archer fails to dig too deep into any of these.  Most of the book is focused on Mallory's various climbing expeditions and his motivation to climb Everest.  It's an engaging story and despite the foregone conclusion, suspenseful.    There's little to complain about, although I felt Archer painted an overly romanticized portrait of Mallory (he can do no wrong) and I would've preferred more on Mallory's prime rival--and a very interesting character in his own right--George Finch.  The biggest gripe I have is in documentation.  Archer fails to provide the reader some idea as to how much of the story is made up and how much is factual.  Yes, it's based on a true story, but how much is true?  It reads as if it's a biographical account, which it is not.  The postlog was helpful and a good addition to wrap things up, but a narrative from the author describing what liberties he took, would have made a good book great.  Nevertheless, \\"Paths of Glory\\" is an excellent and recommended read.
B00133KFGW|4.0|I liked it.  I realize that it wasn't real believable, but it is marketed as a fairytale, so I didn't expect it to be a factual drama.  It's a very pleasant, romantic movie.  Not an Oscar noteworthy movie... just entertainment that makes you feel good after watching.
B000001ESF|5.0|I have not always been a fan of some of Rush's songs....but it's funny, you know after a period of time passes and you hear the same old songs and receive a different take on it. Point in case with 2112...wasn't one of my favorite Rush lps @ the time-yes I used to have em...shine me off if you wish. After 15 yrs of not hearing this since the first time...wow! I now have all the songs of the record as my favorites. LESSONS being in the top currently for this particular record-followed not too far behind by tears, 2112 OVERTURE,TWILIGHT ZONE,SOMETHING FOR NOTHING and finally PASSAGE TO BANGKOK. Alas, I am also in the process of rebuilding my collection of Rush, which funny is also being filed in my Zune as well.   That aside, I am sure each of us have our won favorite Rush lp in the their heart-mine being FLY BY NIGHT in that it was my 1st Rush!(no pun intended) I can't really say I don't have a least favorite though...so I keep an open mind when listening to the band's music. hope this helps anyone thinking of buying this or any of their othe music. They are definitely worth leistening, depsite what so-called music critcis say about them!
B001JNNDAQ|2.0|I'm afraid I have to agree with other reviewers of this Blu Ray version of William Friedkin's masterpiece. It looks awful a large part of the time, which completely ruins the other times when it shines.<br /><br />Ironically, the problem lies in the film's strength - its gritty portrayal of New York and the drug culture taking a grip of it in the early Seventies. The Director wanted realism - not just in his actor's performances, but literally how their New York playground looked - so he went for that. Movements are blurry, alleyways are hazy, characters are observed from an out-of-focus distance (aping what Popeye Doyle sees) - everything's grimy and washed out - matching the film's down and dirty feel.<br /><br />Unfortunately when you get outside of the sunny Marseilles sequences and into the seedy bars and restaurants of the Big Apple - the Blu Ray picture resembles worn out videotape - it's really awful. Which is such a shame, because as you watch it again - but this time on the big screen - you realize what a blindingly fabulous film \\"The French Connection\\" is - and how it deserved so much better than this.<br /><br />In fairness to Fox, the opening credits are squeaky clean - no lines, no scuffs, nothing - no print remains that clean after 38 years, so some restoration has to have been done. Unfortunately when you get to the street action - instead of enhancing the watch - the Blu Ray only makes the deliberately grainy effect look even worse.<br /><br />Half way through it - I couldn't stand to look at it anymore - I turned it off...<br /><br />Unless you absolutely must own this, rent it first before wasting your hard-earned on yet another dog on this increasingly frustrating format...<br /><br />What a disappointment.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|What does Capitalism have to do with rating a movie? lets be real the first and origiinal movie the Matrix was excellent, if it was ended there we would all be still talking about! what is the Mtarix, however hollywood is about maximising profits, why not see how deep into your pockets we can go! they bring sub- stories and plot with only one thing in mind to confuse! i will not comment no more on this movie, i feel that most of you people don't really care what you watch as long as everyone is watching it too. This movie assinated this series completely and that is good. laterz folks.
B000O2W58O|5.0|The Who-Live At Leeds *****<br /><br />The Who were always their best when they were just a balls to the wall rock n' roll band not trying to be anything that they aren't (i.e. an R&B group, or an Operatic workout). Live At Leeds is possibly the truest of all the albums The Who would release during their strange yet influential career. Aside from By Numbers that is.<br /><br />Always known as a live group even today Pete and Roger still put on one of the best middle aged rock n' roll shows one is ever likely to see. This from late 1969 is more than likely the best your ever going to hear the Who live. A live album which truly shows the power of a group that at the time was on top of the world due to the success of the concept opera that was Tommy. But what you get here isn't from that album thankfully.<br /><br />Townsend proves he is more than a poet here but a real life guitar God. Not but a mere rhythm player in the back but a full fledged force to be reckoned with! The nearly 15 minute guitar work out that is 'My Generation' is a true testament to that. Roger Daltrey shows that he had finally found his voice and would soon take over on the next album, Whos Next. But what is most impressive but less surprising is Keith Moon and John Entwhistle who the world already knew as the strongest rhythm section in rock take it to a whole different level here on Leeds.<br /><br />Live At Leeds is the sort live album that every rock n' roll band wishes they could release.
0786838655|5.0|In this book by Rick Riordan, we meet a young man named Percy Jackson.  Percy's life is turned upside down when he finds out that not only do Greek gods and goddesses still exist, they are all still having children as well.  To make matters worse, he finds out that his father, who he thought was drowned at sea, is none other than Poseidon, one of the Big Three gods.  Due to a prophecy made well before he was born, Percy is thrown into a world filled with monsters, fairies, and temperamental deities.  Percy must find a very special object and clear not only his own name, but that of his absentee father's as well.      This is a wonderfully written book that follows the travels of Percy and his two friends, Annabeth and Grover.  Together, they learn all sorts of secrets about their own lives and that of the gods.  Although intended for children, it is a great read for both adults
0316017922|3.0|I found Outliers a very enjoyable read.  It's central idea is conventional wisdom: There is no such thing as a self-made man.  Everyone benefits from or is hurt by the place and time they were born.  But the examples that Mr. Gladwell finds to illuminate this point are interesting.  Children benefit immensely from the month they were born in when it comes to organized sports and school (the reason is relative age).  Korean Air flights kept crashing in the 1990s because Koreans aren't forceful enough in dealing with their superiors.  There is a surfeit of examples in this book but they are all interesting.  This book is for someone who prefers \\"fun\\" reads to more challenging materials.
0525478183|4.0|John Green is an exceptional man, that is true. This book, on the other hand, I'm afraid is not exceptional. Though it is well written and is a fun story to follow, it's not very deep. The majority of the characters don't seem to be fully developed and the a good portion of the dialogue leaves a lot to want for. The story line seems a little ridiculous at times, but overall, it's simple enough to follow and easy to understand what he was trying to get the reader to take from this book.<br />Definitely a book meant for young teenagers (I wouldn't go so far as to say young adults) and could probably be a useful tool for a counselor to use with teenagers.<br />I don't want this to be a negative review, it surely is not. I just want to point out that this book is probably meant for a Junior High School aged child rather than a High School aged teenager, as it is advertised for.<br />I fall into neither of those categories, so maybe my review is biased- or would it be the opposite?
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|There's a moment in Curtis Hanson's 1997 peach of a film when Guy Pearce playing good-guy cop Ed Exley enters The Night Owl caf&eacute; to check up on possible multiple homicides in the early hours of the morning... As he does, the camera pans across the Formica counter and the nearby tabletops, the saltcellars, the napkin dispensers, the circular seats, the candy vendors... There's tons of stuff in a few seconds - all of 1950s - the attention to detail is mind-blowing... Hanson had made a $15 million dollar movie look like it cost ten times that and I'm thrilled to say that this BLU RAY version of \\"L.A. Confidential\\" does exactly the same.<br /><br />While it's not \\"Zulu\\" or \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" perfect in terms of print - other people's reckoning of 4.5 out of 5 is accurate. I'd estimate that 80-90% of the time the picture is glorious and even when it's a little soft in places, the rest is `so' good, you hardly notice. Also, as you re-watch it, you realise just how good LAC was and what a superlative job Hanson did in bringing the seedy underbelly of Hollywood and the LAPD of the time to the screen. Everything fits on \\"L.A. Confidential\\" - the incredible ensemble cast you couldn't buy for love or money now - the chemistry between them all - the ruthlessly realistic story and spunky adaptation of it, the beautiful night locations, the dapper clothes, the colours - even Jerry Goldsmith's music - mellow brass followed by staccato piano fills - was absolute genius! It all worked - and now it looks the business too.<br /><br />Watching Crowe and Basinger in the main feature in all their beautifully filmed sizzling glory is a treat for sure - but the list of extras is equally impressive too.

B0007XT87G|5.0|I really enjoy this album, especially some of the more mellow parts of this Progressive Rock CD. I give this a slightly higher rating than ¨In Absentia¨, the other Porcupine Tree album I have.
B001PPGAIK|1.0|I was really hoping this movie would be great, but after suffering through it, the movie seemed to have 3 or 4 endings prolonging my agony, I cannot recommend this to anyone.    Historical type movies are a favorite of mine so I was looking forward to viewing the movie. And I would have to say I rarely look forward to watching newer movies as both my husband and I favor watching older movies  (ie: pre 70's). But, the movie seemed very dis-jointed, no flow. The co-stars really didn't seem to fit well together. The story was not so bad but the paper to screen transition just didn't work well. I would have to say the direction of the movie was pretty bad.    As the movie plodded along I kept thinking...\\"it will get better soon\\". But I kept waiting and lost track of time and by the time I gave up waiting the movie only had another 30 minutes to go so I decided it was good to suffer sometimes so I watched the end. As least it will never have bothered me that I didn't see the end, that was the best part of this movie, the actual part when the credits started to roll.
B001N26GFC|5.0|In a time when more and more film makers tackle increasingly darker subject matter, Mike Leigh's Happy-Go-Lucky takes a unique approach by presenting familiar themes through the eyes of someone who is almost perpetually happy. Poppy, magnificently portrayed by Sally Hawkins, is a very outgoing young school teacher who, after having her bike stolen, decides she is in need of driving lessons. As it turns out her driving instructor Scott, played by Eddie Marsan, happens to be the complete antithesis of his new pupil. The film centers around similar interactions Poppy has with various characters, like her roommate, sisters, students, and in particularly her weekly driving lessons with Scott. Though some may find Poppy over the top or just plain annoying at times, she embodies many characteristics too often absent in today's society. She is comfortable with herself no matter what others think and gives without over analyzing her actions. That being said, Poppy may seem like a character gliding chaotically through life. However, the more we see the more we realize that Poppy is far more in control of her life than most. Happy-Go-Lucky is a film about learning to greet life, even its darker aspects, with optimism as opposed to the all the often pessimistic views of today. This is not an easy film to make and Mike Leigh should be commended for giving the role of Poppy to Sally Hawkins, who completely owns it. Comedic performances are often overlooked, though Hawkins' performance should be met with a level of enthusiasm matching anything seen this year.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This is a great movie. It combines drama, comedy and adventure all in one great movie.  It is a long one, but it's worth watching every second.  The preformances by Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are both fantastic and there are no better people to play their roles.  It's truely one of a kind...the best movie I've ever seen!
B0000041Z6|5.0|The Chicago Symphony set the standard for modern orchestras, rising to the top of the orchestral world in the 1960s and staying there into the late 1980s.  These recordings span much of that era, and while the recording and editing technologies often fail to do justice to these performances, the final product is still stunning.  As an orchestral musician and conductor, I've performed and/or conducted almost all these works.  While Solti's interpretations can be a bit extroverted, he has a sense of structure and flow that is unmatched by other conductors.  These sprawling symphonies come across as cohesive statements.  The Chicago Symphony's playing is consistently excellent and often unbelievably good.  No other Mahler symphony set has this high a level of consistency and excellence, though I'm sure someone (probably Berlin & Rattle) will find a higher peak soon enough.  Enjoy.

B000EHRVP6|5.0|HOSTEL, like AUDITION, BROKEN, HIGH TENSION, etc., is best seen knowing nothing about it. Eli Roth has made a viciously tricky classic here. Unlike in his earlier CABIN FEVER, the main characters (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) are likeable guys. They're unaware of the fact that their idea of fun- smoking as much pot, drinking as much alcohol, and nailing as many hot babes as humanly possible- is actually exploitive, and could even be dangerous. They are just young, hormonally explosive college kids, out for the experience of a lifetime. This is also their undoing, as they are oblivious to any hint of impending doom. Even after their buddy Oli disappears, they still return to the nightlfe and the two gals they've hooked up with. Hell has to literally open up in their faces before these guys realize they're in deep, deep trouble. HOSTEL is part horror / cautionary tale, part sadistic blast of jet-black humor, and part geo-political commentary. Roth builds the story slowly (they used to call this character development), revealing the true terror in one big switch, like waking up in a bloody nightmare, while suffering from the world's worst hangover! Yes, HOSTEL can be a gruesome, bleak affair, but it is probably not as gory or twisted as rumor has made it out to be. There is a certain morality buried under the bodies and viscera as well. That's another difference between HOSTEL and CABIN FEVER. HOSTEL hits you in the head and gut w/ a hammer for a reason, not simply to shock you and make you sick...
B0013K6WLM|1.0|Congratulations, Danger Mouse: you have sucked all the life out of one of my fav bands!

B000069CWE|3.0|Reanimation by Linkin Park is a remix album from the songs of Hybird Theory. The best remix is My December, that song sounds better than the original which is hard to achieve. Chester Bennington has some powerful chops, how does he not lose his voice every day? Points of Authority remix is pretty good and In the End but I wasn't all that impressed with all glossy riffs. Stick to Hybrid Theory instead.
B000W061HE|2.0|Whitesnake were always an anomaly amongst rock(?) bands. Most of the original WS were from 70s classic rock and heavy blues bands, and their early albums reflected this, but then the 80s hit and metal became trendy and fashionable, and WS reformed themselves to be the ultimate hair metal band. The band became a farce, with the only constant being David Coverdale, who then still had one of the best rock voices around, and a rotating band of musicians, all of whom were good, but combined made WS possibly the ugliest (and the oldest) hair metal bands around, which did nothing for their popularity.    This is an OK album at the start of their downfall. If you really like mediocre 80s hair metal ballads this is for you, if you like blues-rock music pick their earlier albums.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I don't usually buy soundtracks unless a song really grabs me.  I left the theater with \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\\" stuck in my head.  The next day, \\"Super Massive Black Hole\\" was stuck in my head.  I had always liked \\"Decode\\" (big fan of Paramore), so I figured I would buy the soundtrack for those 3 songs and count it as a successful purchase.  Now I find myself listening to the whole soundtrack over and over again, especially songs 1-5.  Great job selecting music for this movie.
B001MYIXAC|1.0|I love this movie. I've watch this movie eleven times at theatres including festival screenings. I couldn't hear the swedish language but I liked to hear them, and the subtitles were more than good enough to understand the meanings of the lines as well as the subtle diffence of the original language.     BUT, this dvd has totally different subtitles. Problem is that the translation is terrible. The worst. Totally Irrelevant to the lines or situations. This ruined the beauty of this movie.     The theatrical translations are dubbed into English voice. What the hell is matter with Magnolia? Why didn't they just put the same translations into subtitles? Magnolia Home Entertainment, You disappointed lots of fans of this movie.

B0000042HV|5.0|Like Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Bartok, Shostakovich decided to dare himself to compose truly, the most profound and intimate of all genres of chamber music. The string quartets constituted for the previous named composers a sort of intimate diary of profound reflection around and about their human condition, historical perspectives and personal statement. No other soviet composer achieved such level of dense expressive grandeur and like Bartok, Shostakovich found out in this genre the perfect device in order to convey to a selected audience who, far from the crowding applauses, the repeated ovations, noisy acknowledgments and the great energetic display of overpowering orchestral masses, could to get close still more to that narrow circle of sublime grandeur and opened heart expressiveness.<br /><br />Perhaps it was a mere coincidence (I don't think so)to have composed exactly 15 Symphonies and 15 String quartets, but the certain of the case is that Shostakovich began to compose these chamber works since the times of the Eighth Symphony. Needless to affirm we have a musical genius in absolute domain of his powers.<br /><br />Like Bartok, it's definitively useless to intend to understand the minimum facets of the soul of a man like him and his Hungarian colleague in case you do without these emblematic works.<br /><br />In this particular set you will find out by far, the most extraordinary and musically idiomatic performances of his musical legacy. It would not be exaggerate that this renowned quartet will be reminded in the memory of the future by this priceless effort, and their most legitimate and coveted masterworks.<br /><br />Don't think it twice and acquire these legendary musical treasures.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret had a profound affect on me.  I read through it quickly, and then read more slowly, hi-lighting as I went.  When I was through the second time, I watched the video as well.  At the end, Bob Proctor asks us to write down our desires, and I did.  I never have thought about what I desired, for now and for my future - what a great thing to do!    It is as if who I am expanded, and a thirst for knowledge and experience of things physical and spiritual emerged from me.  I am grateful for Rhonda and the other teachers who shared some of what they know, and now the essence of who I am includes their thoughts and experiences too.  If you want to possibly view life from a positive perspective, read this book!
B000059T00|5.0|My 'Bible' for rock music is the 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide. But there are times when the critics really miss the boat, and their scathing attack on this album is one of those instances. It seems to me that many critics hold it against Blind Faith that they were created to be a supergroup, and therefore feel obliged to cut them down to size. Reality is, however, that this was indeed a supergroup. How could it not be - including Clapton, Baker, Winwood and Grech? Steve Winwood was in his prime on this album, and no-one can argue that his was one of the most unique and beautiful voices ever in the genre of rock (just try him on 'Traffic' & 'Mr Fantasy' by Traffic - oohwee!). Then there is Grech - ex Family, which is one of the most underrated, unusual, truly artistic and original rock bands in history. Add virtuosos Baker and Clapton and you do indeed have something stratospheric. This must be one of the top 20 rock albums ever, and how well it ages. It definitely works for me. I am glad there was only one because it is great, and a follow-up may have detracted from its greatness.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I sort of stumbled across this series quite recently when I got On Demand and HBO.  This show is broad-ranged and entrancing.  HBO was playing reruns, I think, of all the episodes in a row on one day.  I would tape and then watch most of them in one evening.      All of the actors are superb.  The writing is impeccable.  The stories are captivating.      I can certainly see why this was a hit in Israel and why it continues to be one over here also.

Also the board recognized WoW on my computer which made it very easy to program.  I programmed macros like different abilities for my character.  I used different settings for different characters.  This was all very easy to program.    However, after the first few days, I found it extremely difficult hitting certain keys, reaching the joy stick, and keeping my hand in that awkward position, so I started going back to my old keyboard. I would love this product, if only they would make the keys easier to reach.\\"      I took only one star off for this because he is a little small for his age and this may not be the experience of older/bigger boys or men.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Be sure to have a high definition TV to watch this stunningly beautiful rendition of a tragic but beautiful love story.  The pallet of colors is breathtaking and the story moved me.  Have a few tissues available because it touches on many of the most heart-felt emotions imaginable.      This film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and it is the vision of director Vincent Ward of a possible view of life after death.  It challenges us to think of possibilities while also dealing with our humanness as well as our spirituality.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film with Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Annabella Sciorra!
B001NFNFIK|3.0|In my opinion, James Lee Burke is one of America's greatest authors. When I read they were making a movie adaptaion of one of his best novels, \\"In the Electeic Mist With the Conferate Dead\\". I couldn't wait to see it. What happened? It appears this movie skipped the theaters and went straight to DVD. The cast is brilliant, but the movie was not as good as anticipated. Tommy Lee Jones and others make the movie enjoyable enough, but it could have been great with Jones cast as Dave.  If you haven't  read the book read it. None better.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|Worth it for the long overdue MTV Unplugged DVD alone, not to mention a number of great outtakes from the recording of their first album. The alternate versions of the two 'singles' soundtrack songs are amazing, as is the very underrated 'Brother.' A great collection.

B0002A2WDQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I was very happy to see it again and have it in my home. It is a great story about an American legend. If you like American stories and the blues, you will love this movie. Speaking from the business end, this was a good product, good service and good price. What else could you ask for?

0689878451|5.0|[[ASIN:0689878451 And Tango Makes Three]]<br />This is the true story of Roy and Silo, two male chinstrap penguins living at the Central Park Zoo who not only pair-bonded, but also hatched and raised a penguin chick named Tango.  The book conveys Roy and Silo's affection for each other as well as their desire to hatch an egg and their devoted parenting.  The Author's Note at the end explains a few more of the details.  A touching story made stronger by the fact that it is true.
B001C08RHA|5.0|\\"Iron Man\\" is a really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Casting Robert Downey Jr as the very personality flawed billionaire military weapons manufacturer Tony Stark was just perfect.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, the movie follows the transformation of Tony Stark from selfish (not sure he actually changes much there) playboy to a full fledged Marvel Superhero (but as Pepper says, \\"You are NOT a superhero\\").<br /><br />Obviously this type of movie requires some suspension of disbelief, but the humor, action, and special effects keep the little issues way in the back of your mind.<br /><br />A very enjoyable movie, Highly Recommended!

0226264211|5.0|Milton Friedman, the most influential economist of the 20th century, writing on the economic fundamentals of a free market economy in his book, \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\", demonstrates that government should be limited.  Not only were his ideas relevant for his day, but they are remarkably relevant in today's deficit spending/ever growing government take over of the American free enterprise system.  Milton Friedman shows you why a free market capitalist approach leads to the optimal balance between government involvement in the private sector and our individual liberties.
1416550534|5.0|Not only did The House at Riverton remind me of one of my favorite movies, Titanic, but it also it also reminded me of some of my favorite books: The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield and Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier .  The story begins when the ninety-eight year old narrator, Grace, is contact by a filmmaker who is interested in interviewing her about a family she worked for as a maid when she fourteen.  The members of the Ashbury family are all dead, and Grace is the sole survivor of the Riverton household.    The details surrounding the Ashbury family, who once occupied the house at Riverton, slowly come to light throughout the book. The one thing the readers learn immediately is that something very tragic and mysterious occurred at the historic manor house. A famous poet, RS Hunter, supposedly drowned himself at a lake on the estate, and the two Ashbury sisters, Hannah and Emmeline, never spoke to each other again.    Much like on Titanic, the elderly Grace emotionally recounts events that seem almost a lifetime ago. The book smoothly and beautifully transitions from 1999 to Grace's time at Riverton during the World War I era. The details about the Ashbury family are revealed gradually. Grace hints that the events that she lived are not the ones the filmmaker is using for her movie. What really happened? There are plenty of clues if you pay attention.    The book is one revelation after another. It's mysterious and engrossing. This is one of those book where I was dead wrong when I attempted to guess the ending. I won't spoil it for any potential readers, but I will tell you this. The actual truth about the mysterious death of Robbie Hunter was even more tragic than I imagined. I actually sat there stunned for a few minutes and reread the page to make sure I read it right.     Everything about this book was fabulous. It was extremely well-written. It has love, mystery, betrayal, and dark secrets. What more could you ask for? I can't recommend it enough. I hadthis book sitting on my wishlist for months. I could kick myself for waiting so long to read it. A five star masterpiece!

1400079179|1.0|What struck me as funny as this climbed the best seller list and so many people were reading it, was that a group of people started saying that the work of fiction had a basis in reality. Naturally that leads one to read the story and find out how farcical that is.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code had a few too many leaps of faith and suspensions of disbelief to be a great story. As a mystery, it was so-so. As a phenomenon it was worse. I read it in two days on a cruise and wish I could get those days back for a different book.<br /><br />But reading the story does give you the right to have a dialogue with someone and tell them that if they believe the story to be factual, then they are living in the fantasy world of Dan Brown. Too many outlandish things to make the conspiracy a reality. Perhaps that is what kills it. The more complex a conspiracy, the less chance it has a being believable.<br /><br />So how many things that could be probable, well perhaps our heroine is who she is purported to be. How does that connect to two of the most recognizable pictures of the renaissance. One, or the other, but both? Too many ingredients in the mix. The story just doesn't sell and is not worth a reread ever.<br /><br />Then Tom Hanks in the moving, and he certainly is not playing as heroic as he has been capable of before...
B0006GANN2|4.0|I do like this movie, in fact I think it is very well done and very entertaining, but in the end I must admit that this is far from a brilliant movie.  It is an effective police thriller that never really transcends the boundaries of the genre and this becomes rather generic when you think about it.  The performances are good, but not great, and as much as I love Gene Hackman I must admit that this is a far cry from his best performance (look to his 1988 work in `Mississippi Burning' for a more fleshed out and human portrait of a conflicted lawman).<br /><br />The movie concerns two detectives, Jimmy Doyle and Buddy Russo, who are struggling to tie up the lose ends in a drug ring; the French connection spoken of in the title referring to the Marseilles port through which the drugs are making their way stateside.  Doyle and Russo are two very different cops with two very different ways of handling their jobs, and as the pressure mounts we can see Doyle boil over until his actions are speaking much louder than his words.<br /><br />It is tense in scenes, and then car chase scenes are ridiculously brilliant, but in the end I can't get around the fact that this is not the movie it is touted as.<br /><br />I will say this; William Friedkin does a brilliant job of creating an engrossing and fast paced thriller that will always keep you glued to the screen.  Even when the film feels unoriginal and rather redundant it is still captivating thanks to Friedkin's stellar camera work.  He's a dynamic director, and while this is not his best work (I found him utterly flawless in `The Exorcist' and all sorts of fantastic in `Bug') he has an unforgettable style that will keep your attention.  The script is nothing fantastic or truly memorable, but it works for what it is trying to be.<br /><br />I understand that this served as a foundation for better police thrillers to come, so don't think I'm knocking it's `classic' status, I'm just pointing out the fact that it has not aged as gracefully as it could have.  Especially when you consider this according to today's standards you see that this is a very `by the books' thriller that takes little leeway to become something revolutionary.<br /><br />The performances are stable, but nothing more.  Both Hackman and Roy Scheider received Oscar nominations; Hackman going on to win the gold, but in all honesty I wouldn't have nominated either of them.  Scheider delivers a very hollow performance, beings that the film isn't really interested in him as a character.  He is merely there to represent a polar opposite to Hackman.  At least Hackman does `something' with his performance, but even he doesn't really do much.  He is merely a gimmick; a thin fabrication of what the `crooked cop' character is supposed to look like; but he really has no meat on those bones.  There is a back story there, but it rarely makes it to the surface.<br /><br />Again, I like this movie, and I watch it frequently because it is so engaging; but I have to be honest and point out the fact that it is rather hollow and no where near what it could have been.  I give it a B, and I do recommend it, but I recommend it with reservations.  I will not pimp this as cinematic brilliance; because quite frankly, it's not.Especially when you consider this according to today's standards you see that this is a very `by the books' thriller that takes little leeway to become something revolutionary.

B001R4MEYI|5.0|Without getting into the debate as to whether Crack the Skye is Mastodon's best album to date, one would be wise to just point out its differences, both strengths and shortcomings, and leave it to the fans to do the ranking.<br /><br />On first listen, Crack the Skye will immediately stand out for its easily noticeable absence of screamed vocals. Troy Sanders uses his clean voice on almost all the tunes, with very few exceptions. Without doubt, it will take some time to get used to his style, but repeat listens only serve to solidify one's opinion that the songs on this disc have been composed in such a style to sound much better with this approach. Pain-ridden vocals pop up only to provide contrast to the more melodious direction taken in spots. The chorus on \\"Ghost of Karelia\\", for instance, proves all the more powerful as the vocals shift from the mostly clean style to somewhat aggressive outbursts.<br /><br />The guitar tandem of Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher lend the songs a solid, unbreakable facade, which elevates them to a whole new level. From the apocalyptic opening chords of \\"Oblivion\\", chock full of despondent riffs and rock-based guitar solos; to the calculated riffery of \\"Divinations\\", they implant dynamics to the compositions through and through. Rather than entirely focusing on heavy, punishing jackhammer riffery, this time around they also utilise progressive metal-like jam sessions and blues-inflected passages. As a result, the constant shifting of dynamics on \\"Quintessence\\" renders the tune more creative and interesting.<br /><br />The ten-minute epic \\"The Czar\\" is built upon flawless songwriting and mood construction. Broken down into four parts, it launches into an unadulterated groove from the mellow \\"Usurper\\" to \\"Escape\\", though the vocal melody on this one is not among Mastodon's best. With \\"Martyr,\\" things retreat back to clean acoustic lines before picking up the trademark Mastodon riffs and seguing into a wonderful blues-inflected solo.<br /><br />Scott Kelly from the amazing Neurosis continues the tradition to guest on Mastodon discs (he also sang on Leviathan and Blood Mountain) and appears on the title track, among the album's most progressive pieces as it strangely recalls 90's King Crimson in the way the guitars have been arranged. The guitar solo on this track is among the best ever!<br /><br />As stated above, how Crack the Skye will rank in Mastodon's catalog remains to be seen. However, from a production standpoint, it is by far the band's best-sounding album. It was produced by the great Brendan O'Brien whose resume includes all kinds of different artists, from Pearl Jam to Stone Temple Pilots to Bruce Springsteen to AC/DC to Aerosmith to name but a few. O'Brien has managed to create a dense album with many layers, thick guitar tapestries, and heavy, solid drum and bass battery. He was also unafraid to render sound effects on Sanders' voice with great results.<br /><br />The album title is a homage to drummer Brann Dailor's sister Skye Dailor who committed suicide at the age of 14, so this is obviously among the more personal musical statements of the band.<br /><br />Highly recommended.amazing Neurosis continues the tradition to guest on Mastodon discs (he also sang on Leviathan and Blood Mountain) and appears on the title track, among the album's most progressive pieces as it strangely recalls 90's King Crimson in the way the guitars have been arranged.

B001R4MEYS|3.0|OK, on first listen I was really shocked.  I mean, they kept saying that this would be a \\"change\\" or \\"progression\\" which usually means it will be mellower. Well that is true. But the vocals are so totally different that you really can't get into it!!  The prog thing, well, I like ELP and King Crimson just as much as Exodus and Slayer.  But it just seems like Mastodon have gone a bit too far on this one. There are moments of intensity but they're just too few.  Play this one right after Floyd's \\"Echoes\\".  Let's hope it's a one-off experiment, and the next one rips your face off.  The whhaaaaaalllleeeee!!

B000WTSWTK|3.0|Christina's Back to Basics tour is quite a splendour to watch, it is clear that she has matured in many ways than one. What I love about this young talented woman is that she took the reigns of her career into her own control, others like Britney, although very successful, had their careers controlled from the word go (only now is she having more creative freedom) no wonder she had a break down. Christina however had it with doing what others expected her to do and only after her first album broke away with \\"Stripped\\" it shocked us a little but her talent shone through and she never turned back. This extended to her project \\"Back to Basics\\" her most mature work. This DVD is spectacular amazing costumes, incredible (and I mean amazing choreography and dancers) and the cherry on the cake, Christina's mind-blowing vocals, man can she let it rip. A Jamie King production, so you know its good, I mean look at Jamie's work with Madonna's \\"Reinvention, Confessions and Sticky and Sweet tours as well as Ricky Martins \\"Black and White tour\\" masterpieces to say the least. I absolutely enjoyed the \\"Welcome to the Circus\\" section, a visual masterpiece.    The only reason why I did not give this DVD 5 stars is that I felt too many of her classic hits were redone (different versions) e.g Come on over, What a girl wants, the only track that was original was the closing track \\"Fighter\\", I love to hear my favourite songs the way they are, although stars like Madonna have done a good job of reinventing past songs, e.g Erotica (Confessions Tour). Apart from that Christina rocks again, oh and did I mention that this woman can sing?
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I bought this film because I am a huge fan of horror movies. But not just any horror movies. I like the surprises, but Hollywood has become very generic in their horror films. People watch these because they feel it's better to microwave, than to marinate. I myself believe that the best horror films marinate. The ones that unwrap slowly and catch your attention. The ones were the characters are well defined, and loyal to one another.   The relationship between Oskar and Eli is very necessary. If you watch closely, you will see they are alike. The atmosphere in this film is spooky, and strange,  as it unravels before your eyes. You must try this movie, it is slow in some parts, but worth it til the end.
B001AZI1W8|3.0|I have a lot of respect for Rihanna, she has captivate the world with her unique style, performance and vocals. Some hate her voice, I say she is unique, she is Rihanna and for that she gets 5 stars. The Good Girl Gone Bad album is undoubtably her best, my first Rihanna CD I bought and did not regret, the videos left on me a great impression, I mean who can forget the amazing \\"Umbrella\\" video with her painted in metalic silver (I wonder if she borrowed the idea from Madonna's \\"Fever Video\\"), great dance sequence, her body is hot, amazing. \\"Shut up and Drive\\" another great video Rihanna looks hotter than hot, I can go on and on. I am however not impressed with all the other releases of this album \\"Reloaded\\" and \\"Remixed\\" they are really milking it for what its worth.     Anyway getting back to the subject at hand the \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" live DVD. I guess I expected too much, I expected to see her dance like she does in her videos but she rarely does, she also seems to have put on a little (and I'm just being nice) weight on the hips, I was looking forward to see the hot bodied Rihanna from the Videos, it was not elaborate enough as I wanted it to be for such a successful album. She does however sing all her hits from this amazing album including a few from her previous album including the massive UK #1 hit \\"SOS\\", the sound quality is great as well and the behind the scenes are pretty cool to look at, you see her in a different light, she seems like a really down to earth lady and she will always be gorgeous. The show is okay, I expect much more, but hey get yourself a copy and see for yourself.

1416914307|3.0|City of Glass was predictable in the sense that everything which was probably meant to be \\"unexpected\\" was spoon fed and printed out in huge neon letters. I'm trying to not give anything away- but basically, you have all the answers given to you and nothing is a surprise. There are no plot twists that aren't formulaic in scope.  The world Clare creates is an interesting one at least, and is what kept me reading this trilogy. I'm also happy when a series gets *better* with time, doesn't spend dozens of pages rehashing what already occurred and leaves me feeling entertained at the end.  The writing is a bit fanfic (and I'm not just saying that because Clare was a Harry Potter fanfic writer.) I say this because sometimes the details she provided reeks of: \\"I really need to be more descriptive\\" and it just turns out to be laughable. One example was (and I can't find the page, but I honestly had to stop reading and shake my head a sec) was when Clary notices Jace looking at Simon (yeah) with amusement, respect and a third emotion... all at the same time. My mind boggled as to how all that could be accomplished in one look. Bit much.    In summary. Nothing new plot-wise, everything is pretty obvious- but the world she creates is entertaining.
1591841666|5.0|In life it is usually the small things tht get us caught up in getting ahead. This is a super simple read that is more of a book to quickly read when having a bad day. The information in the book is not ground breaking but it still is inspiring. If you can look past the simplicity of this book and read into the message it will work great for you. This is a book I keep on hand as an extra to give to somebody when they tell me they are having issues with moving ahead.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This movie kept me interested from the very beginning.  It was intense, romantic, and heart breaking all in one.  I was so entranced by Nullah played by Brandon Walters.  There was a main story about the cattle ranch, but entertwined was the story about Nullah and what could happen to him.  The scenery was breathtaking and inserted into the movie at just the right moments.  The 2 hours and 45 minutes flew by and left me wanting more! I am so happy I bought this movie because now I can replay it over and over again.
B00005OWEG|2.0|In this updated version of \\"Heart of Darkness\\", set during the Vietnam War, U.S. Army Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on a mission up the river to Cambodia to assassinate a Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a Green Beret who has gone crazy and set himself up as a god among a group of natives. Along the way, Willard meets a variety of people whose actions lead him to the conclusion that it is not just Kurtz who has gone mad, but many other members of the American Army, too.    When \\"Apocalype Now\\" was first released, back in 1979, it clocked in at a, still pretty long, 153 minutes. With \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\", writer/director Francis Ford Coppola restored 49 minutes of previously unseen footage, bringing the film to a hefty 202 minutes, and I'm not convinced that it was necessarily to the film's advantage. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is often hailed as a modern classic, and I thoroughly agree that some of the segments within it are brilliant, in particular, the \\"Ride of the Valkyrie\\" scene. The cinematography in this film is some of the best you will ever see and it's no surprise that \\"Apocalypse Now\\" won the Best Cinematography Oscar. However, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.     Each of Captain Willard's stops on his journey is meant to highlight the point that whole American Army has gone crazy, something which Kurtz serves as a metaphor for (that is, the fact that American imperialism has gone mad and needs to be stopped), but Coppola makes this point within the first hour or so of the film. Many of Willard's later stops aren't necessary and they end up diluting the impact of Coppola's argument, rather than reinforcing it. The first hour of this film had me engrossed, but by the time Willard stopped at the French plantation (at about the 2 hour mark), I found myself wishing that he would just get back on the boat and keep moving. It takes 140 minutes for Willard to reach Kurtz and by then, I just didn't care. The film had completely lost me. It is this fact that makes me question the wisdom of inserting the extra 49 minutes of footage into the film.
B000003TAL|5.0|Okay, Total Trash is good, and...blah, blah, blah, but it all concludes with Trilogy, especially Hyperstation, to create a full, unbelievable concept, yes, concept, album. You don't have to be on drugs to enjoy it, either. I loved it, even after I quit drugs.<br /><br />Sonic Youth is total hit-or-miss. I loved Dirty, but didn't get in to their \\"classic\\" extremely popular Goo, with that annoying Bull in the Heather, sung by Kim, which was radio popular. I also loved Dirty, which wasn't as popular, and saw them in New York (home ground) for their Washing Machine tour. The album was so-so, but it was really great live.
B001VEJTMY|5.0|When we last left Our Heroes, they were on Apophis' ship, facing the impending destruction and/or enslavement of everyone on Earth.<br /><br />So unsurprisingly, the second season of \\"Stargate SG-1\\" can only get better from there on. In fact, this is when the clever, innovative sci-fi series really started to gel together, with more intriguing storylines, character arcs, and some new alien allies -- basically, it all blooms.<br /><br />Intending to blow up Apophis' ship, our heroes get captured by the Jaffa and thrown in a cell -- only to be unexpectedly rescued by Bra'tac (Tony Amendola), Teal'c's old teacher. As Earth mounts a pitiful defense against the Goa'uld, SG-1 joins with a small band of rebel Jaffa to stop Apophis' invasion -- but they may have to leave one of their number behind.<br /><br />Obviously the Goa'uld make things awkward throughout the season, with the second episode featuring Sam (Amanda Tapping) being possessed by a Goa'uld during a rescue mission -- but it seems that it's part of a rebel Goa'uld faction called the Tok'ra. Teal'c's (Christopher Judge) son is kidnapped and brainwashed, and Daniel (Michael Shanks) finds that his beloved wife is pregnant with Apophis' child.<br /><br />And of course, SG-1 has to deal with lots of other stuff -- insectile transformations, black holes, prison planets, Native American \\"spirits,\\" invisible bugs, hostile alien orbs, reliving their most traumatic memories in a VR world, and time traveling to 1969. And O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gets an ancient repository of knowledge downloaded into his head -- and he'll die if they can't reverse it.<br /><br />\\"Stargate SG-1\\" really got into its stride in the second season -- the basic Air-Force-versus-evil-headsnakes story gets expanded out into a bunch of arcs. We get new villains, some surprising new allies, hints about the true origins of the Stargates and the human race, and corrupt factions on Earth who use the spare Stargate for evil ends.<br /><br />The writing gets even steadier and the alien worlds more interesting -- even stuff that sounds goofy, like the planet of singing mushroom-people, somehow works. The drama is stronger, and the sci-fi usage of the Stargate ever more creative, such as when a black hole's gravity well keeps the gate open, and is slowly sucking Earth through the wormhole. Good, tense stuff.<br /><br />Of course, all the action and sci-fi is heavily tempered with comedy. Even in grim situations, there's usually at least a few funny moments, such as Daniel's tour of the custodial closet. And of course, the dialogue is priceless -- most of the good stuff comes from O'Neill (\\"That's between you and your god. Oh, wait a minute! You are your god! That's a problem\\"), but Teal'c (\\"In my culture, I would be well within my rights to dismember you\\") and the others usually get some good ones as well.<br /><br />Of the main cast, Amanda Tapping gets the juiciest role in this season -- Sam deals with the impending death of her father, becoming a Goa'uld host, and trying to deal with the feelings it left behind. Including a cute Tok'ra boyfriend. Yet when we see Sam's vulnerable sides, Tapping never lets her character be anything but a strong, capable military woman.<br /><br />But the other actors aren't neglected -- Shanks' Daniel grapples with the news that his wife is pregnant with Apophis' baby, while Teal'c faces losing his entire family. Anderson is brilliant as the quirky, capable O'Neill, but he really gets brilliant when Jack's brain is being overwritten -- he has to emote and communicate without a comprehensible word.<br /><br />The second season of \\"Stargate SG-1\\" is where the story began to really get great, building up a series of strong story arcs, funny dialogue, and strong characters.

B001PPLIEQ|4.0|You'll find no plot synopsis here folks.  Amazon has been goodly enough to handle that for us all.<br /><br />Was this film as good or as great as Casino Royale?  NOW WAY.  Was it a good addition to the new Bond mythology?  HELL YES!  This is a direct sequel to Casino Royale...literally.  It starts right after the end sequence of the previous film, bypassing the usual Bond firing at the screen(though, settle down fan boys, you get it at the end--I know, I know, change make you scared...).  Basically, the opening helps establish the previous films plot, or the fact that there was an even larger plot at work, one involving new Bond evil organization called Quantum, of course.  New Bond virgins, ones who skipped Casino Royale, will find it fairly hard to catch up to speed on this film.  They also won't feel the impact of how much Vespa's death in the previous film really effects his current mission.  It's not impossible to figure it out, but not as satisfying.  So see Casion Royale, and consider the opening act of this film the final moments of the first.<br /><br />When I said this film starts right after the last film ends, I really, REALY meant it.  The opening logos fade and we're slammed right into the tail end of a car chase(apparently, Bond is being chased by some thugs working for the man he shot at the end of Royale).  The opening chase is fast and brutal.  You feel all the car hits and collisions.  I'm really not a fan of this ultra-choppy editing style, similar to that seen in Michael Bay's atrocious Armageddon, but in this film it really works to solicit the right tone, feel, and impact that the action sequences strive for.  On the action sequences, this one is loaded with them.  There's an action sequence about every five to ten minutes, whether its a car chase, foot chase, fist fight, knife fight, or plane old-fashioned gun battles---oh and a boat chase to boot.  I guess they forgot to include the ski chases from previous Bond adventures.  What I will say about the action sequences is that they are short and sweet.  This film doesn't make the mistake of so many recent action films of letting the action sequences run on too long.  They show up and leave an impression before the audience has a chance to be bored, unlike the technically brilliant but totally dull freeway car chase from the bloated Matrix Reloaded.  Action in modern films seem to spend waaaaay tooooo much time in the set pieces.  They feel inconsequential to the actual plot or character.  They are just there to show off effects and stunts and things blowed up real good.  It gets really boring.  This film, by its main character's nature, every violent act holds weight while also being exciting.<br /><br />Of course, we have the new Bond, who is in my opinion the best Bond of all time.  Of course, his films have better writing and no one will ever forget Connery's iconographic portrayal, but as far as a dramatically engaging Bond, Craig has got them all beat.  His basic struggle in this film is the transition of a brutish, but charming thug who needs to put aside his personal feelings(revenge for the death of Vespa in Casino) and just get his job done effeiciently with less ending up dead.  Bond goes back and forth.  He seems indifferent, at first, to the deaths he performs, but you can see in Craig's eyes that it's taking a toll on his psyche.  It's not in the dialogue, it's in his face and his movements.  Whoa, an actual film that shows us things rather than having lengthy speeches and convoluted expositional dialogue about it.  Now I know American audiences like to have everything spoon fed to them, especially when it comes to action spectacles like this, but if more movies would take this route films could become great again.  The new Batmans and Watchmen are also helping in leading this charge.<br /><br />Also, a great addition to the new Bond series, started in Casino Royale, is the relationship between Bond and M.  Their relationship comes off on the surface as combative, but with actors like Dench and Craig in the roles, we get hints of a deeper respect.  A hint of two professionals getting to know each other grooves, constantly testing each others' merits. Awesome stuff.  M and Bond never electrified together in scenes in any of the previous Bond pictures.  It's smart writing and even better acting.<br /><br />The film does have some weak spots that keep it from a solid 5 stars.  Firstly, the villain is more slimey than imposing, but the realistic world this Bond takes place in doesn't really have room for any Blofelds, at least not in the skin previous Bonds portrayed him in.  The final action set piece is slightly lackluster.  Emotionally it's a power house for our new Bond girl and for Bond himself but the pyrotechnics don't overshadow the ones seen in previous action scenes.  The new Bond girl doesn't leave as much as an impression as the Eva Green in the first film.  She's good but her story and relationship with Bond doesn't plunge the same depths.  Though, the couple share an interesting exchange before they say goodbye.  The editing style, like I mentioned, is choppy and fast,so some might find it disorientating.  I find it works for once, but others might still be turned off by it.  The film also doesn't breath as much as I felt it should.  It jumps from one place and one action sequence in fast succession.  I felt a couple more quiet moments would've been welcome.  But that's about it.<br /><br />This is Bond by way of Jason Bourne, but Bond is and always will be a more interesting character.  I'm just talking about the Bourne films, not the novels.  So settle down.  Like the new Batmans this film goes for realism, while still being absolutely silly and unbelievable.<br /><br />The villains main plot has to do with ecological terrorism, and GASPS, the enviroment.  So, those who pull their political leanings into everything will hate the film and accuse it of the further brain-washing that Hollywood pushes on us common folk.  Brain-washing, that apparently, have no effect on them, and only them.  Ugh!  Enviormental issues are topical now, just like they were way back in the early 90's.  A film trying to plant itself in the modern times would be ignorant to not use it.  There are gadgets in the film, despite what fan-boys say, but they are smaller and truncated to be more believable.  They're not gloated on or masturbated to, and they rarely help Bond in ultra-convenient moments.  Still no Q.  Get over it.  He may or may not show up in this new series of films.  Besides the film's plot has no room for an action/plot stopping Q sequence.  The humor is dry and dark.  If you like it broader check out all of Roger Moore's cannon as well as the last two Brosnan Bond films, they're loaded with broad humor and puns.  It must be comforting to know that if you hate the new Bond, you have 20 other old Bonds to satisfy you.<br /><br />People who don't like the new Bond go on and on about how the filmmakers don't seem to know why people like or go to Bond films.  Really?  Bond like many other comic book-like characters go through changes.  Bond books were much different than most of the films, maybe with small exceptions on the two Dalton films.  These movies not only modernize and make Bond relevant again, they hue close to the Ian Flemming books.  This is a good thing.  Though, I warn readers of Flemming that this film has nothing to do with the actual short story Quantum of Solace.  How could it?  That was a very short story that consisted of a Bond inner monalogue while he was by himself.  I guess they just thought the title sounded good, and the name of the villain organization would be nifty if they called it Quantum?  Dunno, don't really care.<br /><br />Finally, if you can't handle brutal violence taking the PG-13 rating to the edge, then skip this.  There's many cartoons and other older Bond films with inconsequential violence and silly inventions.  Take your pick.  If gadgets, one-liners on the cheesy and sexually charged innuendo side, silly Bond girl names, Q comedy sequences, globe trotting for the sake of new foreign location to put the tired action, lack of danger, volcanic hide-outs, and a story that you can't really get dramatically involved in outside the action sequences are the only things that you judge a Bond film on, then please move on and let the rest of us enjoy the innovation, oh, and the scary changes.<br /><br />PS:  The new Bond theme song isn't as good as previous films.  It's better then some, but not as good as Casion Royale, but on the whole it fits the tone of the new film.  The first direct Bond sequel.<br /><br />LATERtly, have no effect on them, and only them.

0393324818|5.0|Perhaps I'm a bit behind the times, but I had intended on reading this book for many years.  As we approach the start of another baseball season, I finally remembered to get a copy of Moneyball.  I loved it!  I couldn't put the book down.  It was a quick read, and great look at the mind of Billy Beane.  Frankly, I think I may have become a bit of an Oakland Athletics fan...or Billy Beane fan.  I would recommend this book to anyone that has even a casual enjoyment of the game.  Its a must read for any true baseball fan.

However, when midnight chimes, Death comes and asks the boy to be his apprenrice...<br /><br />Although Death has featured in discworld novels before, this is the first one wher he is one of the main characters and he is very much developed here.<br /><br />Death decides to take a vacantion and \\"live\\" by visiting cities such as Ankh-Morpork while Mort is left to do his job of visting people when they die. However, Mort falls in love with one of his \\"clients\\" - a beautiful princess - and instead of collecting her, he saves her from ebing murdered, thus starting an increasingly-serious chain of events because he has changed the way the world was ment to be by allowing her to live.<br /><br />This book was very funny and amusing and full of the usual wonderful discworld characters.
B00004XPPE|5.0|I sat on the edge of my seat throughout most of this movie.  I actually saw it for the first time many years ago, but it seems when I watch it over again, it is like the first time.<br /><br />The story is chillingly real-very much something that could have happened. A group of bombers fly fast the 'failsafe' point armed with nuclear bombs and headed for Moscow.  The whole set of events that is set in motion by this is so artfully and suspensefully woven together, that once you start watching it, you really can't stop.<br /><br />All the actors are perfect for this film, especially Walter Matthau as a cynical political strategist who believes that the USSR and America could survive a nuclear exchange.  You will also see a very young Larry Hagman as a Russian translator (pre-\\"Jeannie\\" days) who spends most of his time in the movie with the President played by Henry Fonda.<br /><br />All in all today's movies even with their special effects can't match the psychological suspense of movies like this.  This is one for your library.<br />By the way, be sure to get the 1963 version and not the remake.  Some things are better left alone even if somewhat dated.
B000QQH4YS|4.0|A policeman is shot to death by a gang of criminals while on duty and is subsequently brought back to life as \\"Robocop\\" by his superiors on the police force, as an advanced police officer that is part human and part machine. During this process, his memory is wiped, but he slowly figures out what happened to him and sets out to get bloody revenge on the men who killed him.<br /><br />An excellent 80's action scifi movie that has ages very well. Ultra-violent and quiet disturbing in places, this is a unique and unmissable movie.
1401207138|5.0|Amazon price was great (37% off) on this large hardcover edition.\<br /><br />I bought this after reading the recently purchased softcover edition. This big hardcover is much nicer, albeit harder to read while on the can ;)<br /><br />The dustcover is pretty, but fiddly -- you will not be reading it with the dustcover on. Looks good if you lay it out on a coffee table though!<br /><br />The extra material at the back is pretty neat, although I wish there was more of it.

6305428425|5.0|Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion   (1997) Mira Sorvino, Lisa Kudrow  If you hated your years in high school (and I imagine probably everyone but the select few \\"populars\\" did...ergo the wide appeal of this film!!) then you will connect with this satiric, wild ride chock-full of witty dialogue & brilliant characterizations.     Before a scant 5 minutes have passed in this film, the scriptwriters get your attention right out of the starting gate with great lines between the title characters such as: \\"You know we've seen Pretty Woman like 36 times and I never get tired of making fun of it\\" and later on in a nightclub when they determine that there are just no hot guys there and decide to dance with each other, Romy wonders if it would be better to be a lesbian. Michelle asks her if she wanted to try having sex together just to see if she was. \\"Oh no\\" Romy says \\"the idea of having sex with a woman just freaks me out.\\" But then after a moment of careful reflection concludes \\"but...if neither of us has gotten married by the time we're 30, ask me again.\\"     This movie took a chance on hiring what were then relatively new to the game players (Alan Cumming - \\"I am invincible\\" Boris from Golden Eye, Mira Sorvino from Mighty Aphrodite and Jeane Garafolo - Carmine the Bowler's daughter from Mystery Men) and was rewarded with the complex portrayals that usually come with older & more experienced actors. We all know how people can get stuck in a time warp and feel that either high school or college was the best years of their lives and never grow out of it. Such teen-angst-turned-impenetrable-adult-fortress is a hard one to pull off, but this cast does it beautifully. I particularly liked the quirky underlying Wizard of Oz-ish There's No Place Like Home theme - or in our heorines' case - There's No Better Person To Be Than Yourself.     And the movie's title provides the perfect platform for the double entrende of the concept 'Reunion'. Our 2 girls discover on their road trip that the reunion they really wanted was with themselves and to reach a true understanding of how wonderfully original, kooky and happy they really are.
B0018OAPAW|4.0|I have no idea where all these reviews calling this album \\"over produced\\" come from.  This is the product of a tight, skillful band who have matured since they started over two decades ago.  I found every track listenable, none seemed out of place, poorly done, or re-hashed.  I think the negative reviews may come from the positive outlook of the album.  Frankly, I get tired of listening to negative ideas all the time.  This album seems to come from the perspective of \\"hey, life is good, even when bad things happen\\".  It talks of being proud of what you do, even when what you are doing is not popular, or safe.    While none of the songs on this album are my \\"favorite song\\", I like every song on this album, and several are outstanding.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|Horrible album! This album is Cornell mixed with R&B (and crappy R&B at that). The beats tend to be more prominent than Cornell's voice. He plays second-fiddle to the music(?). I was really shocked when I heard the synthesizers used on Cornell's voice. It covers up the talent. If you are looking for some great Cornell rock music, try any assortment of his other tunes. (Temple of the Dog, Soundgarden, Audioslave, or his other solo titles)
B00003CX8Y|1.0|This movie was a bootleg and I told the owner who sold this to me. She did not believe me and basically told me I was wrong and I need to change my opinion about her because she is trying to make a living. I do understand that people are trying to make a living, however, when a customer complains about a product that was sent to them I feel like you should try and make the customer happy. This was not done. The movie was reviewed by a professional and it was a bootleg. Everything was copied. If I wanted a copy of a copy I would have went down to a corner somewhere and bought a copy. Amazon refunded my money to me immediately so I will give amazon 5 stars for working with me, If I could give the seller 0 I would but I have to give one because that is the only way you can comment. I would give a 0 because she was not nice or cooperative at all.
0312383320|2.0|Plum Spooky, the newest book in the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich, was disappointing to me.

Maybe that would have given the book more of a plot...anywoo, I'll just tell you to get this one from the library or borrow it from a friend who was duped into buying it. You would be PLUM dumb to spend YOUR money on this one!

B001KMB6VE|4.0|This is a really pretty movie to watch on blu-ray because of the special fx in it.  Also its a pretty good storyline and this is a role to fit Vin Diesel talent.  It doesn't require academy level acting so therefor its the right part for the right person.  I actually was thinking that this wouldn't be that good, but I enjoy the heck out of it.  Vin Diesel gets hired to escort a girl from one part of the world to another and of course, there is something special about her and other people want her.  Diesel is some sort of ex-soldier with extraordinary skills.  So no more really about the story because it is the basic escort story where the guy has to fight off other bad guys.  The blu-ray looks phenomenal.  The action scenes really pop in 1080i (i normally don't watch movies in true HD, because, sometimes in 1080p, certain movies, you can tell that is CGI).  I think the movie is a guy, blow stuff up/shoot people movie and since I like those type of movies, I found that this more than lived up to its genre.  I actually heard bad things about this movie and nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, my friend and his whole family enjoyed the movie.  It is engaging and I think all will enjoy watching it.  I know this isn't much of a review, but its the rather typical for its type, no real big surprises.  You know who the good guys are and you can pretty much guess who the bad guys are without that much thinking.  Still, fun to watch.  It's a good storyline and cool to watch stuff blow and bullets fly.  This movie is not trying to be more than what it is.

B000002H5I|5.0|I originally bought this CD back in the 80s, and while living near South-Central LA, found the songs to be honest, sensitive and a bit sad that there is so much truth in the words.

0786838655|5.0|This book was a masterpiece. The way Rick Riordan uses mythology is just insipring. I couldn't put the book down. Finished in one day that's how good it is. The only thing that i didnt love about this series is that the author foreshadows too much and that can get annoying. For example the book will say \\"it was a great plan, and it almost worked too.\\" Before telling the story of how the actual plan occured. That's the only fault i could find with this book the rest is just amazing. Definitely a great buy
B001R4MEYS|4.0|I have been following Mastodon since Remission. They prgressed better and better each release. I for one am glad to see them head in the direction they are heading in, and I hope they never look back. This is the smartest thing they could do in a world saturated with generic so called \\"death metel\\" bands. Dont get me wrong I love metel but ever now and then I like to challenge my self by listening to more complex music (not just technical for the sake of being technical). I say buy this album if you like Mastodon you will love this. The vocals are different but do you really base your likes and dislikes on throat ripping vocals?
B00136RT1I|5.0|I actually really liked this cd. This has to be one of the best Michael Jackson albums he's ever came out with! The beats are awseome, the songs are classic, and the messages are great! My favorite track had to be dangerous. I thought the beats were slick and the hooks were great. I actually really liked Jam to that has to be an interesting hidden gem from michael jackson. I thought it was really good. This is truly another pop classic album! I thought it was really good. It's very similiar to Janet's rhythmn nation album! If you like pop music and are a fan of rock then this album is def. for you!
B00127RAJY|5.0|After reading other people's reviews I decided to buy the DVD.  I'm glad I did!  I would consider myself at an average fitness level, but someone who could use some more gym time.  At first, I was following the video and was like, \\"Huh?  This is it?\\".  Then, after getting into the video, I can see how it works.  By the end of each circut of workout I'm ready to start yelling at my TV.  I've worked out to this video about 8 times so far and still feel the burn in my chest, arms, abs, legs, and butt!  I love this video!  I can't wait to 'graduate' and go on to the next two levels...whew!
