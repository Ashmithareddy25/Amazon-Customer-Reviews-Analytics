B004GJXQ20|5.0|I loved reading this book because the author uses a style that captivates the imagination with ease. I am looking forward to reading the other four novels in this series. I liked his usage of imagery and the portrayal of the action through various perspectives.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i absolutely loved that game so much it was the best ever i learned a lot about how treat animals.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Can play every day or once a week.But be carefully.It's very easy to get lost playing...puzzles are solvable for any age group.....
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have it for my ps3 my ps vita my galaxy s4 and my kindle fire hd have it beat on all of them but still can play more
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Take  time limits off and fix the stick then it's a good game lower the cost of upgrading thing's  then it will be a great game
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Game will crash and no longer be able to connect to server. I am not happy as I just took advantage of a pearl sale &amp; now I no longer play the game. I should have been told this before I downloaded the app.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Starts slow, but once you have dinosaurs it really gets going. This is my 'replacement' game for Oregon trail and I enjoy it more. There is no penalty for not playing for awhile and the missions have not been within a certain timeframe (yet).<br />Try it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is wonderful.  You can put in any location and it will tell you what the weather will be.  It lets you look at an interactive map also.  Great map for when you are on the go!!!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|A lot of time and missions or quests are required to level up unless you want to spend actual dollars.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Without the biases of Fox News or MSNBC, and coverage of news that's not catering to American tastes and interests.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Game has awesome graphics an runs really smooth on my pantech flex.  all items can b unlocked Without spending money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not impossible. Definitely exercise for your brain. Great puzzels for the brain. Need to see more of these. Love to explore and put it all together.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Very different and entertaining.  Love that there's lots of unusual things going on.  Really keeps my attention and can't wait to watch the next episode.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|love this show and now love watching it all again.  noticed some character changes i hadn't noticed when it was on TV.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|i admit that i normally do not watch musical movies...so i was quite surprised how much i loved this movie!....the cast is funny, the singing is awesome.....and rebel wilson (fat amy) was funny as ever.....its just a good fun movie over all and i've heard that a part 2 is in the works....yeahhhhhh! !!!  :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I first got this game I thought it was ok but when I knew more about it its great.
B002RSDW8A|5.0|Well I don't do spoilers EVER. Streep was perfect as Julia Child. I like the fact that the movie was touching w/o being mushy, and the fact that the movie was very real and honest in it's portrayals. I was totally inspired by the movie and plan on cooking my way thru Julia's book (at a much slower pace mind you).<br />I really loved the extras! Extras and bonus content really justify purchasing DVD's and Blurays and this one was great. I especially enjoyed the cooking lessons:)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is realistic and fun. ive always wanted a horse and this is as closebas ive bitten. I love it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 of Downton Abbey continues to shine with superb writing, acting, and directing. Plot twists and pivotal events draw in the viewers and allow loyal fans to appreciate just how invested they are in the show and its characters.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Charges phone and Nexus 7 at same time.  Both pretty fast! Would recommend.  Also I put my Motorolla Droid on the Apple  higher amp jack and it worked fine and charged even faster. For those not aware, the quality and length of the USB cord makes the charge rate vary greatly.  The premuim ones at monoprice are real good, and charge items a lot faster than cheaper cords. Stay 6 ft or under.
159463176X|3.0|The characters were very well developed and his writing style is so descriptive but I found the last part of the book slow with a weak ending.
B005HSL626|3.0|but easy to get board with.  I know it's the free version but all the sales pitch is kind of irritating.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is fun and I like the chat room. I enjoy that I can choose to play one card or four.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Was exactly as described and came packaged very well, nice high quality set. I would highly recommed this to anyone who likes Batman
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I got this app for my kids because we loved the despicable me movie. after about 10 minutes of fun my kindle shut down without warning and I had to do a hard reset.  I uninstalled.  kids are bummed now.
B004X2M3N8|4.0|The series with Matt Smith remind me of the old Dr Who with Tom Baker: not taking the world too serious.  I love it...
B008ZVJE3A|2.0|it is out dated; not relevant to these times. I do not recommend this video. Please remove it from your library.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This program is a joy to many.  So refreshing to have such excellent acting by all with a great story in a wonderful setting.  My husband is even hooked on the programs.  Friends talk about each episode.  No matter how many seasons Downton Abbey is produced, it will be played over and over by those of us who buy each Series.  Thank you.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Can't get enough.. its smart and funny and edgy.I was sad when the season was over and there were no more suits to watch
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is just an awesome sci-fi series that I have truly enjoyed watching. Sadly this dr was only the doctor for one season, he may be my favorite. :(
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is pretty awesome for free or paid!  I cant put it down! Get it! Get it now!!!<br />Minions rule!!
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|This black comedy has to be watched repeatedly to fully absorb the genius of this film.  Peter Sellars was outstanding.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game. It is fun and challenge. I can't wait for more rooms. Hopefully it will not take long
B002PLALCO|5.0|absolutely loved it. Its awesome. the concert, the artist the presentation. This item is worth every penny. Highly recomended if you are a P!nk fan
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is very fun !!!!!!!! i love how they create the game so the mini games are tricky !!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I want to play this all day...but I'm an adult and must work...but ill play a few more times before I do that!
B000NY12CI|5.0|What a page turner.  I would love to meet this woman to have the opportunity to exchange ideas and promote better conditions for women around the world.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|The Thomas Crown Affair original movie was made when actors and their performances were more important than Hollywood's special effects. Buy it - rent it - but sit back with a bag of popcorn and watch this movie - it's a classic! Grab it while it's still available. There's not a remake of this movie that is worth watching even if the admission is free. Steve McQueen & Faye Dunaway - in 1968 their kiss was the longest in movie history! And the connection between McQueen and Dunaway is electrifying!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|our family loves this game. great for all ages. my kids love the fluffy minigame! moves are like those of subway suffer and temple run.
6305657947|1.0|Sorry remake of a classic! Pierce Brosnan replaces Steve McQueen? That's like Mr. Ed replacing Secretariat! And I have already forgotten the name of the female 'stand in' for Faye Dunaway. So these days Hollywood has more razz ma tazz than it did in 1968, big deal! The remake is a joke - watch the original!
1400052181|5.0|Content Summary:  This book tells of the history of Henrietta Lacks, a black woman who lived from 1920 to 1951 and died of cervical cancer.  In life she was a remarkable woman, and after her death a sample of her cancer cells became \\"immortal\\", dividing without limit, and becoming exceptionally valuable to medical and genetic science.  Called \\"HeLa\\" cells after her first and last name, this book tells the life story of Henrietta Lacks and the cells that helped make her famous.<br />Review:  This book was truly an eye-opener.  I had no idea who Henrietta Lacks was before I read it, only a limited notion of the genetic and medical science involved in it.  This book will truly open a new, fascinating, yet morally troublesome world of questions for the reader, and is an important and timely contribution.  Not only does it clear up who Henrietta Lacks was, but also forces the reader to ask some deep moral questions about genetic medicine and patients rights.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Truly a great  read would recommend it. I did find the beginning a bit sad. The great descriptions are really good.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I'm not a girly girl and I like it it cost money to get more make up and clothes so its fun.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great free app! I give it 5 stars!! Yeppi ki yah! You should try it today!! It is one great free app
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Fun little game love it. The only thing I wish could be changed is to invert the screen 180 degrees. I find myself often hitting the soft keys on the bottom of my Droid RAZR exiting the game. Frustrating.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use calculator.  I have looked at other calculators online and this one seemed to be the most user friendly for basic calculations.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Awesome game love go catch scat and good encouragement. Play every day to visit the animals and see what scat is doing.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|Nice to see Clive Owen in this action pack movie,non stop from the beginning to end. Having Monica Bellucci in it was a little different role for her but I was amaze how good she was. Good movie if you like non-stop action.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It's fantastic. I love it. I can't really explain why without spoiling it. Really well written, detailed, thought out, interconnected.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My son and I loved this movie. Had to get it! Decent price for the bundle. Happy that it came with the digital copy, have it on my phone so we could watch it whenever/wherever.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The new tap to expand and slide to open and close is great. I also love the new photos and videos. Great job weather channel, your app rocks!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I got hooked on Downton Abbey the very first episode! Too much time in between seasons.I want more.<br />Once you see it you'll get hooked as well.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I was a little disappointed by this movie. I love James Franco movies and had high hopes, but the story line just didn't pull me in. I also felt like some parts were skipped over to fast and others were drawn out to long. I was hoping this was more for adults, but there were definitely some &#34;kid&#34; moments that took away from the movie. I glad I watched it, but I won't be buying this movie.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|After reading the sample, I was intrigued enough to buy it. I tried reading several chapters a day but before<br />long, I was turning pages every chance I got. I love plots with twists and and there are some in here. Great read. Finished too soon
B000HL2J0G|1.0|Weak plot and weaker characters.  Perhaps it is one of those series that cannot stand the test of time.  It should be left to rest in peace.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I downloaded and installed the &#34;Kindle&#34; version of the Facebook application but have found several issues. The text screen does not rotate like other applications do. Also the size of the fonts/text in the document are too small to be read and can not be adjusted to any workable size. I am VERY disappointed with the application.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Don't bother.<br /><br />After the year long ride on the best seller list.  This book requires you to totally suspend disbelief and follow the author through a preposterous scenario.  The ending is equally poor.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game of finding the pieces needed to move from floor to floor. needs better instructions in the beginning. worth a try.
6304698658|5.0|Funny movie!
0062280228|5.0|What a terrific book! I really can't say enough about Neil Gaiman. He is one of my favorite authors in the world, starting with my love of American Gods and Anansi Boys and going into my obsession with the Sandman books. Gaiman outdid himself once again with this book. I love that his prose is so well-written and his imagery is beautifully executed. When he describes things, you feel as though you are really there, seeing what his character is seeing and experiencing what the character is experiencing. The seven-year-old protagonist of this book is entirely believable. The reader remembers what it was like to be a child and see things as a child does. I love that Gaiman can so artfully illustrate how a 7 year old would see things and not try to make the language more complex than would be believable.<br />The book starts with the protagonist, now a 40-something year-old man, who attends a funeral. We aren't informed whose funeral it is, but that is unimportant. Gaiman does not overwhelm us with unnecessary details. He visits the home of the Hempstocks, some supernatural people he knew as a boy, and is flooded with memories of things that happened when he was a boy. I actually found myself terrified as the protagonist remembered the villain of his childhood. Even though the villain was a supernatural one, the way the story was written, she could have been real. With the help of the Hempstocks, the villain(s) were dispatched and the protagonist grows up with an alternate memory of what happens. When he meets up with the eldest Hempstock again as a middle-aged man, the suppressed memories come back, but then fade again when he leaves their presence.<br />I loved this book as I love all of Gaiman's work. Magnificent!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Good action movie, decent plot and story. Great shots of Pittsburgh and surrounding areas.<br />Entertaining and enjoyable movie for home rental.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Milan has written characters with such depth that you cannot help but fall in love with them. Not only are Minnie and Robert a fantastic couple, but the secondary characters are written so well that you cannot wait to get to know them, too.
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|The book was a melodramatic hot mess that dragged on...and on...and on.  The movie was mercifully shorter, but like many movies made of long books, it's very choppy, a lot was changed (not that that was necessarily a bad thing), and the romantical portion of the story (which was a huge part of it) was unconvincing.  Besides that, Stephanie Meyers' martyr-like girl main character gets irritating very quickly.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am counting down days until season 4! This BBC classic is a big hit! I particularly like how there is so much attention given to the little details of the time period.
B005SN3VA0|5.0|Not at all the sci-fi film I expected, I was impressed with this story, cast, and filming - I found it brilliant. It does require two things: 1/ You must suspend your scientific logic that it is cosmologically impossible for a duplicate planet to shuffle up alongside our own (without massively effecting each other's orbits, electromagnetic fields, etc.), and 2/ it does start a bit slowly, but it succeeded in wrapping itself around me with the story, characters, and acting. For the most part, it is not a sci-fi story, it is a love story, a story of the terrible tragedies that surround us and sometimes curse us, and it is a story about forgiveness and living through terrible events. Finally, it was the ending that totally hooked me; it is not the usual ending given to film goers and novel readers, where everything is wrapped up neatly and fed to us as if we were stupid cattle.  I can create my own resolution/outcome any way I want, any number of ways I want. I love that; it invites us to imagine, \\"What would I do (if I were that character)?\\"
B00499NHLC|3.0|The acting and story lines in this series were good, but it was rather slow.  Also, I tend to &#34;half watch&#34; TV and this took a lot of concentration both to follow the plot and deal with the English version (not American) of the English.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Does what I needed it to do. Basic stuff. I know there are worse editors available and probably better ones, but Photo Editor + does the job. Saves my edited pic with no hassles.
B001JU4S44|1.0|bad action sequences & unrealistic storyline.<br />by far the WORST of the MI series.<br />the twists were so unrealistic!! and the action sequences are even more unrealistic!<br />thoroughly annoyed
B004TI5N38|5.0|Zero Day keeps on building until you can't take it anymore, and then a creepy intense ending! The story pulls you in and won't let go. What a ride!<br />Be sure to read &#34;The Forgotten&#34; by David Baldacci after Zero Day.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Interesting and some what challenging.<br />It's fun I would buy this app.<br /><br />Would be interested in seeing more levels .Entertaining without too many frustrations.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|This family classic is a great adventure for all, but especially boys will be thrilled.  I enjoyed rereading this after many years.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I've always loved law shows and this has a relationship aspect that makes it a must watch! Can't wait for Season 3!
B005FISBTO|5.0|Again a great year.  The anticipation of next season is intense.  I can't wait til Dexter returns and I can watch it again.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This weather program is wonderfully accurate. I rely on their predictions and appreciate the warnings they give out. I loved the free version for a long time... now that I have upgraded I love it even more. Great program!
B003L77GRO|5.0|As always Dexter is great.  This series is so intense and intriguing I look forward to it every year. Awesome.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Having lived in Memphis 20+ years and living the blues for over forty I didn't get it until the second go round. It ain't strange just different. Boz does it his way. Duh! His name is on the album. Just give it a chance it is good music done well.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|My son introduced me to this series and I'm glad he did.  It is intriguing and fun to watch.  We enjoy discussing it together.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I'm 18 and I play this game. I love it. :) it is so creative. angry birds came along way from when it first came out. excellent game guys.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Not as good as the first, but still worth the read. I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait to get my hands on the next one.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|At first the game was great .....now it took all my coins and i cant rexieve anymore coins ive looked online and alot of people have this problem .....please fix the bug -_-
B00992CF6W|1.0|I wasted $7.00 for a game`s creative mode to lack: flint and steel, changing times of day, craftable nether portal, extended world boundries, changeable game modes, dungens, fortresses, strongholds, etc.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Pretty good for the second book. Will most likely read all four but made the mistake of seeing the movie of the first one. Won't do that again.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This is a very entertaining game only problem is can cost a LOT to play.  You have to pay for extra bubbles.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Great book! Looking forward to the discussion at book club this week.  I am anticipating that we will have a rich discussion around this book.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|So far it's been fun. Doesn't take much time and its way to know what to do. I have been warned that when you get far you have to start paying real money for upgrades.
B008CZ5WLM|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see Hellyeah on the Gigantour Concert! They rock it hard and fast like it should be!  This is a great band from the ashes of other bands.  Definitely a must listen!!!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Which is this movie for its thought of being full of action. The story was great but not too much going on. The end has some blowing up scene.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenged and fun. I would Definitely recommend if you like to solve puzzles. The only confusing part is that once clues are combined, one part may not work to open a riddle.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  I especially enjoy Maggie Smith.  The writers are wonderful as well as the story line.  I hope it stays on for many years to come.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Great film in the best Star Trek tradition. I highly recommend this movie to Trek fans and non fans alike.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this story! I couldn't put it down. The chemistry between Abby and Travis was amazing! I haven't enjoyed a book like this in so long. I will definitely read more from Jamie McGuire!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game keeps your mind working!!!<br />teens would like this , searching for clues to get out of the room is fun.<br /> I still am trying to fifure out one level, it does get tough...<br /> It is addictive, but fun
B007SPPANM|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies!  I can watch it over  & over and somehow not tire of it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app for when you are bored and looking for something to do. Much better then most horse care game apps I have played
B00004U8P9|5.0|This is a prefect addition to my movie collection! Love it! A great cult classic for all the ages. AWESOME!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Couldn't stop playing....loved it &amp; can't wait for more!  Maybe next box could be outside &amp; need other items from nature to interact to open box or play with another player online who would need to complete their part before other player could continue
B0035XVVDY|4.0|Law Abiding Citizen was a very good, but very violent movie.  Good plot, excellent character development and some good twists.  A good vehicle for Jamie Foxx!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|It's been a while since I read it, but I'm going to read it again. Hard to believe than men can push themselves so hard.
B00AGDW8II|3.0|Good portrayals & story. Nobody blown up. Wish H'wood could make &#34;good&#34; movies like this now, maybe would go to more.
0399160450|5.0|Wow - the book was intense from the very begining to the end. Absolutely rapting novel. I could put the book down. Great job Clancy..keep them comming,
B008XFJEE2|2.0|The story is not coherent, all it is about is sex and not a deep relationship. If I had known about it I would not have watched it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Love the game but went thru the puzzles too fast, then had to buy the second half. Went thru that too in an afternoon.
B008PZZV8S|3.0|I totally forgot what this movie was all about. It has been about 3 weeks since I watched it but I cannot remember it, so I can assume it is not the best movie to watch.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It took me a while to get used to the controls. Overall it is a fun game. Buy it. Or don't.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's fun to watch again ... and again. That way you can get a really good look at the fashions, which are amazing. :-)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun but my touchscreen is hard to work with!  Familiarity with the game logic will make the game more enjoyable
159463176X|2.0|I haven't finished this book yet, so maybe this is premature, but I loved Hosseini's other books and was so excited to read this while on vacation.  Parts of it are interesting, but I can't stand the fact that he brings in all these characters and tells all their stories without any passion.  I'm starting to not care about the new characters and I've forgotten all the old ones.  I know in the end he'll bring it all together wonderfully, hopefully, and give this reader a sense of completion, but right now Im skimming the story to get to that part.  The characters are only partially developed because there's another one looming in the next chapter to take his or her place.  The lives of the characters are so fragmented that I really just want to stop reading.  Sorry, Hosseini, I'm just not that into you anymore.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|...when Paul was able to do a show of mostly new songs with just a few old ones for the nostalgic. Nowadays like all other classic rockers Paul is forced to play a show of mostly old songs with just a few new ones to keep things interesting for those fans who care about hearing more than just the old hits.
1400032717|4.0|Mark Haddon, through the protagonist's obsession with prime numbers, his aversion to people and yellow and brown objects, succeeds in writing from an autistic person's point of view. The drama around his family unfolds as Christopher, the protagonist, obsessively searches for the dog's killer and when he finds out what happened to his mother, the \\"skeletons\\" in this dysfunctional family overwhelms him. Christopher's mother left because she couldn't deal with the drama around him. So he travels to London to look for her.<br /><br />After he visits her, she argues with her new lover and breaks up with him. So, Christopher remains the central character around his parents' lives. The dynamics between Christopher and those around him keeps the story moving forward and grips the reader's interest. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a novel unlike others and through it we begin to appreciate an autistic person's mindset.
B008I43DYU|4.0|Standard calculator capabilities, met my expectations as a standard.and as a scientific calculator. I recommend it to others without any reservations.
0688101364|5.0|Great Cookie recipes! Great for Christmas or anytime. I love cookies and for any cookie lover out there this book is outstanding!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A show with real dialog.  The writers know how to make a good show without blowing up stuff.  I dig it.
B00B7HQ1DA|4.0|Reminds me why I have always enjoyed Boz's music and style...his voice is still melodic and uniquely recognisable as one of our national treasures.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|full of action glory and war the best war game and best graphics no end to the challenges epic weapons and combat and easy controls
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun I never want to put my kindle down! I will play it `til my kindle dies and be sooooooo upset that I have to stop and plug my kindle in to charge. It's fun and very easy to figure out&hellip; plus it's FREE! I would definitely pay money to play it. Overall I think this is a FANTASTIC GAME!!!!!  (:)
0425263924|4.0|It was a good read. Keeping up with the story, finding new tasty tidbits. But, I waited 6 months for this and now I have to wait for the next book. Which is hard when they are so far apart, you kind of forget what happened before. Don't get me wrong though, when I got it I couldn't put it down it had twist and turns and returns of former characters which  made it really intense. But how long for the next one?
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is fun hog, however the graphics could be better. Also there seems to be language differences (for example, tongue depresses and spatula s are not the same thing). Frequently need to tap multiple times to get response. All that said I would give this game a four. It's challenging with a good story line. If you like hogs, give this give this one a try.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|So... I hated this show, but my husband loved it. I have no idea what he sees in this nonsense but he and my father-in-law both think it's great, so I'm thinking maybe it's just a guy kind of TV show? I'll average out their 5 and my 1 and give it 3 stars.<br />  SPOILERS AHEAD<br />  Maybe the differing opinions were caused mostly by the fact that the main character, Oliver, is a huge jerk. The aforementioned male audience seems to find his actions relatively forgiveable, because he changes his ways upon returning from the island. Personally, I was outraged that he had the audacity to even speak to his ex, Laurel, as if he was somehow entitled to her making him feel better about the whole &#34;my sister died a horrible death because you were cheating on me with her&#34; issue. I've seen a lot of couples move past betrayals, but that one seemed like the elephant that could never leave the room, yet somehow it conveniently did, allowing Oliver to win back the girl but, oops, commit another cold-hearted betrayal in the process. He steals her out from under his best friend, who witnesses the entire thing because he was taking Oliver's advice and heading over to Laurel's place to see her. &#34;But they'd had a falling out!&#34; my co-watchers object. Oookay. Whatever, ya'll.<br />  There are a lot of inconsistencies. Oliver likes to make the rules up as he goes. One big problem I had with the show was that in the first few episodes, he appeared to be murdering countless bodyguards who for all we knew could be fairly innocent civilians just doing their jobs, only to leave his targets alive. My husband tells me this was later explained away, he was not killing them, only stunning them. Something about electroshock arrows. Sounds like very lazy writing to me, and so does entire flashback storyline. One thing we all agreed on was that the show would have been infinitely better if the story had been told from the beginning, instead of picking up when Oliver is rescued from the island and following two timelines, one in present day and the other consisting of Oliver's memories of how he went from, &#34;spoiled rich jerk&#34; to &#34;spoiled rich jerk who can shoot stuff and may or may not have PTSD&#34;<br />  Lastly, I wasn't to keen on the fact that for the most part, the only time a woman isn't treated like a helpless, useless, porcelain doll in this show is when she is being evil. Kinda disappointing that people still write using the &#34;damsel in distress or villain&#34; theme for their female characters. And yes, Laurel is an independent woman making it in a mostly male-dominated career field... She also has an overbearing father who repeatedly tries to treat her as if she is still 13 years old. And let's not forget how Thea rushes to save her new man in the season finale, only to turn around and flee again because he can't go be a hero unless he knows she is out of harm's way.<br />  Mostly, I just don't like that Oliver is supposed to be some kind of super hero, but I don't see a whole lot of heroism.  &#34;Arrow&#34; is clearly about a very flawed and damaged individual seeking vengeance at all costs, not a super hero.<br />  On the plus side, there are some comical moments, there are pretty people, and there's lots of action. Tons of that &#34;who's gonna die?&#34; suspense. There are even a few plot twists that I honestly did not see coming.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game taught me how to treat a horse the right way<br />I actually feel like I have an actual work on My Horse.
B0098QBEXO|4.0|I liked this movie very much overall.  It is a bit slow in some parts but the end was just devastating.  Very well acted and tremendously relatable.
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|I am still getting used to this app. It seems to be a good app and pretty close the my computer model. The only thing or should I say reason I didn't give this a 5 star was...when I want to clean up my spam I have to do it one by one where as my computer I can clean up all messages at once! Otherwise this app would be perfect.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I could not WAIT to start on Season 3 and it did NOT DISAPPOINT!!!  Love the new season and the old characters!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a cool game. I like it Cuz there is more than one game on this app and cuz its amazing.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this app it is totally cool ! Get it!  My brother and me enjoy it. The Reef Shark is free the Mako Shark is 1500 coins the Hammerhead Shark is 6000 coins the Tiger Shark is 15000 coins and the Great white is 35000 coins. Hope you get it and good luck!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This is without a doubt the best movie of all time, it shows the natural human emotions and physical desires for the rush of adrenaline I absolutly loved it
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book!!! I had a hard time putting it down!! I can't wait to read the next in the series.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Really like this latest book from Rollins. The science, history and fast pace is really very well done. Always learn something new when I read one of his books.
0321857895|5.0|Good intro to sketchnoting. Nice quality book, too--thick pages, good paperback binding.  Showed it to a friend, and she bought one too!
B005K17RU0|3.0|Pretty good with the weather but need to work on the Accu.  Been too far off on too many occasions, seemingly.
B003XKAZKO|4.0|Rather pricey for a re-release, but if you're a mozzer fan that doesn't matter. The sound quality has been criped up a bit and that makes it overall a pleasing album to listen to. Waiting for the DVD release this year.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|Great concept but as the sequels progress the reasons the families are being filmed are getting farther and farther out there.  Story line left me with many questions (spoiler alert) Who the heck is Robbie and why is the kid living across the street from Katie?  Anyway - its great for a rental and night at home but no reason to own.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I think they're running out of ideas and/or inventive plots. Daniël Craig is, as always, a good actor. Too bad Judy Dench is not returning, it was such a great idea to make M a woman.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This 3d version of Life of Pi has to be seen to be believed. Gorgeous visuals, and depth. Beautiful color. A good simple story, touching in spots and very entertaining. I highly recommend this 3d Blu-ray for any collection.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|If you're looking for a fun YA series to read on the plane or by the pool, this is perfect. Not much depth from a young writer who has lots of room to grow, but the love story will draw you in.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|It was interesting, and anticipating like everything sparks writes. I will say that I had no idea the ending would end like it did. I was completely caught off guard and then relieved in just a short amount of time.  Great book the entire read!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book so much I am reading it for the second time and loving it even more. I am even reading slowly so I do not finish too soon since this is my last Hosseini novel and I want to savor it. His human relationships are amazing, just as in his other books. Life in Afghanistan is described at various times in its history. The story also takes place in Paris and Greece, but the most powerful passages are in Afghanistan.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Only the movie's lack of plausibility holds me back from giving it 4 stars. If this was a comedy it would be slapstick. Very entertaining nonetheless and worth watching.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book was disturbing and depressing but it was so well done I was captivated by it. I am a feminist and I think it is great the way Hosseini described the horrid way women are viewed in Afghan society. The truth needs to be told and seen before any change can be made. I found this book empowering. I read this book twice because I loved it so much. He illustrates (in a literary way) his characters so vividly I still feel like I know them. I also read the Kite Runner and Ans the Mountains Echoed. I would highly recommend them all.
1577314808|1.0|I bought this highly acclaimed book on the recommendation of a friend.  He told me it was difficult to understand, but that if I really concentrated, it would be profoundly interesting.  Well, I tried very hard to follow the message.  After reading 60 pages, I decided that if I have to work that hard to understand what an author is trying to convey, he obviously doesn't know how to communicate effectively.  It's the first time I have ever read a book where I concluded \\"This is nonsense!\\".  It's obviously not my cup of tea.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book keeps you on your toes and never lets up, right to the end. It is a parents nightmare. How far would you to protect your child?
B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|It lacks a mix of  sensitivity. I think they should expand the story of Mike and his Grandmother more. It gets weighed down in legal jargon. The Good Wife has that mix.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|An absolutely magnificent movie!!!  The way the story was told was wonderful and the scenery was terrific. I am planning on watching it again!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is incredibly addicting at first i hated it and i saw no point to the game but then i loved it but i want the new update
B00BMT9C84|5.0|This movie was hirlarious and I could really relate to it!!!! Barbra Striesand is my favorite actress...... I loved it!!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I am not sure that I like Alicia's change in personality (early season 3 episodes) from the previous seasons. Still episodes are very good.
B00CHILW64|5.0|I really considered this movie a love story, a tradedy, a very movie film. I just can't imagine going through something like this. I was thoroughly impressed.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I quite enjoy Suzanne Collins' writing, but I feel the thing that depreciated this book for me were the frequent, large stretches of time where nothing really happened to Katniss. Really, this makes logical sense since who would let a 17 year old make all the decisions in politics and war. However, watching the character sit around mentally going through all the horror she has experienced in her life doesn't make for an exciting read. I feel like this last book either needed a different direction than what was written or have had the story told in a different way.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert:<br /><br />For instance, it would have been more interesting if the trial had been more thoroughly told so that you get a sense of what's going on and a bit of suspense on what could happen. I also feel like the tirade into the capital by Katniss' party to be a complete waste. Maybe that was the point but, its a harsh way to kill off the characters she did in the way she did. It seems a bit disrespectful to them to have their lives taken away in such a fashion.<br /><br />Overall, the book was disappointing to me. I liked the first two a lot, but this seemed to end with a whimper rather than a bang. Collins has a gift with action packed storyline and I wish she used it more in this book.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|The Movie was by far my favorite, and I deeply loved the music that was featured in the film. I'm glad to own this item.
B002IVLH60|5.0|BACKSPACER IS WHERE PEARL JAM SHOW THEIR MORE PUNK LIKE SOUND TO THEM. IT IS DIFFERENT THEN THE SELF TITLED OR EVEN RIOT ACT. BACKSPACER CONTAINS A COUPLE OF BALLADS WHICH ARE JUST AS GOOD AS THE ROCKIER SONGS ON THE ALBUM BUT THE BALLADS COME IN AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THEN THE ALBUM PICKS UP AGAIN. PEARL JAM KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE FLOW IN AN ALBUM AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT PEARL JAM FANS WANT AND THEY DELIVER. THIS BAND HAS MADE IT'S HISTORY , THEY SURVIVED THE 90S GRUNGE ERA AND STILL MANAGE TO DELIVER GREAT ROCK AND ROLL ALBUMS FROM THE BEGINNING.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading. I wanted to yell out stuff to the characters myself and wish I could because I can't wait to read book two.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THIS ALBUM IS PEARL JAMS HEAVIEST ALBUM IN SOME TIME THOUGH I THINK PEARL JAM HAS ALWAYS KEPT A DISTINCT SOUND THAT IS EASY TO DEFINE. AT FIRST HEARING \\"LIFE WASTED\\" IT TOOK ME A COUPLE OF SPINS TO LIKE IT BUT AFTER THAT I KNEW THIS WAS AN ALBUM I HAD TO HAVE IN MY COLLECTION OF PEARL JAM. THE SELF TITLE ALBUM HAS ITS MOMENTS WHERE IT SOUNDS LIKE COULD HAVE BEEN IN \\"VS\\" BUT IN ALL REALITY PEARL JAM TO ME HAS ALWAYS DONE IT WELL ALBUM AFTER ALBUM. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE BAD THING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS BAND, TO ME THEY ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BANDS AROUND TODAY AND \\"THE AVOCADO\\" ALBUM IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHY.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and makes you think, always good! Graphics are not bad either. It takes time, be creative and be observant!
B0045DO8LA|5.0|RIOT ACT IS THE FOLLOW UP TO BINAURAL AND PEARL JAM STILL REMAIN ONE BAND THAT CAN MAKE EVERY ALBUM JUST AS GOOD AS THEIR PREVIOUS AND DO NOT CHANGE DRAMATICALLY. PEARL JAM CONTINUE TO STRETCH THEIR GUITAR WORK AND IT SHINES ON THIS ALBUM IT'S ALSO MATT CAMERON'S 2ND ALBUM WITH THEM AS A DRUMMER. ALL OF THE SONGS FLOW WELL AND ROCKS ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so addictive. You can find yourself playing for hours without knowing it.<br />The only problem is you have to get friends in order to get past some missions. Other than that the game is great
B0000027RL|5.0|Theres no question about \\"TEN\\" being an instant 90s classic and one of the best albums of all time. Sure TEN has PEARL JAM's biggest hits \\"even flow\\" , \\"JEREMY\\" , \\"ALIVE\\" but one thing is that all 12 tracks on this album are at it's best. This is one album that you simply \\"MUST HAVE\\"!
0385484518|5.0|I love this book. It made me cry a few times and I am not the type that gets emotional over a book! I highly recommend this book.
B0014YVCDK|5.0|Pearl Jam deliver with BINAURAL and continue to impress album after album and the growth in their music is noticeable and seems like the band is just getting better album after album. PEARL JAM is  maturing and they continue to grow and on BINAURAL you continue to hear the change and how much they have evolved since \\"VS\\" while keeping their roots. BINAURAL is PEARL JAM at the beginning of 2000s and just how they conquered the 90s they open a new decade only to conquer the next and BINAURAL is the perfect way to start it off. BINAURAL is one hell of a rock album.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|It is a good game with lots and lots of combinations. I highly suggest that you get it. Enjoy this fun game that is well worth its cost
B000002AZ8|4.0|VITALOGY... is one unexplainable listen to me.. Through the weird tracks it has and at the same time PEARL JAM classics which is why this album throws me off a bit but at the same time its a great rock and roll album, just weird.  The first 6 songs on this album are unbelievable, Pearl Jam start to sound a little more mature and experimental at the same time . Songs like \\"PRY TO, BUGS, AYE DAVANITA, FOXY.........\\" are just weird random  jam sessions and don't seem to have a place in the collection of songs. Vitalogy is a strong solid experimental change but there is no doubt that Pearl Jam still deliver and this album proves why they became who they are today 20 years later, and are now icons.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin and an outstanding supporting cast in one of the best Westerns ever.  Put this on your bucket list, even if you aren't a big fan of Westerns.  The Duke is, as usual, strong and speaks his mind, but he is also frustrated and angry at the events that transpire when lawyer Jimmy Stewart comes to town.  Lee Marvin and his henchmen, Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin, are as nasty as they can be.  I'm not going to reveal more, but this is not your typical oater and the ending will stay with you.  Well, pilgrim, are you staying or going?
B000025QLX|5.0|With 3 albums in, and their popularity just kept getting bigger and millions of albums sold Pearl Jam went in to a somewhat change and experimented with VITALOGY and still had success but without a question they went through some difficult time with that album as they even admitted. On their 4th effort NO CODE, Pearl Jam deliver one of their best performances musically and lyrically. NO CODE still has the feel of VITALOGY but is alot stronger by a long shot, they continued the experimentation they had on their previous album but sound better and a band that is put together. Pearl Jam reach their strongest points on \\"NO CODE with  \\"SMILE,OFF HE GOES,AROUND THE BEND,SOMETIMES\\" but NO CODE is one of 90's most underrated albums and till this day i try to understand why, sure it's no \\"TEN\\" but bands evolve, and NO CODE is the evolution of Pearl Jam.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the best descriptions of actual combat that I have ever read by one who was in it! Excellent gun descriptions.
B0000028UK|4.0|VS takes pearl jam forward from the success they had with TEN, Pearl Jam take their music slightly in a different direction with the acoustic rock ballads \\"DAUGHTER\\" and \\" ELDERLY WOMEN..\\" VS has the heavy rocker openers \\"GO\\" and \\"ANIMAL\\" and the band keeps you well hooked and listening delivering great song after great song. Though VS is slightly different then TEN it still holds great songs and strong follow up to TEN and is easily with no question a \\"GRUNGE CLASSIC\\".
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not a big reviewer but I thought this book deserved 5 stars. The detailed writing, the engaging story and the character development was all done very well. I enjoyed this book and think any sci-fi/dystopia enthusiast would enjoy this read. Highly recommended.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|For my taste - an excellent read. A well-written, poignant story which involved me and created emotion. The written regional dialect is  just right - not too difficult to read, and you hear that lilt in your head.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is good for all ages even my six year old sister likes it.I have a lot of apps but this one is the best.you should get it.
1593082037|5.0|It was required reading for a class I took but I ended up really enjoying it.  I plan to read more of the short stories out of pure pleasure.
B00821OX98|5.0|Friends recommended this show, and I do enjoy it. Interesting twists every week , and you do start getting into the characters.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Notice that I used &quot;little&quot; twice in the title.  About 3-4 hours of play here.  Good for what it is and the story has promise.  They need to follow-up with a few more in this line to capitalize on the good work here.
B0040HO16S|5.0|This has to be one of the best dramatic series ever produced for television. The music, the costumes, the characters that comprise the cast, and especially the captivating storyline - it's all excellent. Plus, it's very family friendly!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Another great Khaled Hosseini read. It connects well from start to finish. Wonderful story, fabulous characters and it wraps up well at the end. You'll love it, give it a try!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I now give this a one star because it is now too difficult to use. it was perfect before , a real five star, but now I will have to find one that is easier to use.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very entertaining game. My 7 year old loves it and got me addicted to it. Only part I didn't like is that I wish it had more levels
B008Y72BD0|2.0|Movie began well, but when the &#34;heroine&#34; was allowed to leave Iran for Austria, she revealed herself to be a self-centered, alienated, drug-using misfit who elicited neither interest nor sympathy from me. She, and therefore the movie, was more repugnant than interesting.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 1 was excellent and continues in Season 2!  The plot is well written and the characters are perfect for their roles!  Deals with family, love, war and SO MUCH more!  Can't wait for season 3!!!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I had to watch this on cable several times to understand both the acting and meaning.  A virtual line up of Great Britain's finest talent and at age fifty two I wish I had seen this at twenty six.<br /><br />It would be great and no insult if we could cast an American version minus the usual industry remake amateurs that would set this gem in NY or LA.. Cast Jim Garner to start, location in either Baja or Belize and think Sandler could knock it out of the park.<br /><br />The highest compliment for a movie is that it lives wonderfully and rent free in our imagination.  \\"The Best Exotic Marigold  Hotel\\"  goes better - buy a scooter and take your Best Girl for a picnic.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I love Bon Jovi anyway but this CD is very easy to listen to and required no &#34;breaking in&#34; time like some do.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This is a great movie. A lot of subtle humor,action, wry wit, and a love story with Bill Murray and Zombies.
B000P2A256|5.0|This is a good CD from Maroon 5 even though it is older. I had heard one of the songs on the radio and looked up the CD as Iu had never heard the song before. Really enjoyable.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I have been using the phone app for my tablet.  I will say that it will work with some minor frustrations.  However the HD version takes away those issues and is worth the buy.  The text entry is better, the screen sizing is better, listen it is just better.  If you have the phone app and only use it on your tablet every once in a while, you can get away with just the standard app, but if you really use the app on your tablet, get the HD app.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|You could certainly tell how this was going to go, retold catch phrases, unrealistic situations, incredible amounts of destruction and the hero's whooping the bad guys. Yet you find yourself going anyway.
B0055S348W|5.0|Printer share mobile print works very well, no complaints.  I use this app with multiple devices from phones to tablets.
0143117009|5.0|Another scholarly, well-done, eminently-readable piece of work by Diamond... the author who brought us &#34;Guns, Germs, and Steel&#34;.  In his former book he illustrates and demonstrates the factors that enable societies to succeed.  In this book, he explains the behaviors of those societies that maintain the success or lead to failure.  There is a message here for America in 2013... assuming that we are smart enough and have the political will to heed it.
B000I8ERVC|3.0|It's what you expect.  Young Jack Nicholson.  Doesn't end well.  Ten more words are required so I'm adding this sentence.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|The story was good but the book is filled up with long, drawn out teenage sex scenes that really damaged the story short  US trying to tell. I don't think I will subject myself to the sequel.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I have had this for awhile and would recommend it to any Castle fan! An absolute must have! Love it!
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Love fantasy movie with creative story. Colorful CG makes each frame and scene an art. Great screen write. enjoy the movie in 3D.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent, riveting series. The actors portray their characters perfectly.<br />Fun to watch because so many different story lines. It keeps you guessing what will happen next.<br />The setting and historical period items fit very well.<br />The video and audio quality is awesome.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Stuck on mars alone with no way to contact anyone? Piece of cake!<br />Bought this book just because I was bored and it seemed alright, after reading it I have told countless people to get it, read it and love it. One of my favorites! Its written so you are there with Watney the whole way, feeling what he feels and listening to his HILARIOUS commentary. Amazing detail, human emotion and its soooo funny.<br />Again hands down one of the best books I have read in a good while.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|If you're not energized to make some serious changes in your life after reading this book, you may be dead. I especially liked the accountability commitment. People pursuing mastery are accountable and responsible. They're leaders. Don't let this opportunity to take your life up a notch get past you. Read this. It's the one thing you can do right now that will make everything else either easier or unnecessary.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|like this game alot fun .. worth a download . try it out. lol. only eoing this for the gems  you get
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Love my new Kindle Fire HD. I take it with me everywhere. I do wish it could play on-line videos and the camera faced forward. It does what is made for very well. Read, Facebook and check emails with an easy to read screen.
034580404X|5.0|Ad said \\"new\\" and they were. Still in wrap. Paid less for all 3 books than I would have paid for one in some places. Arrived almost before I turned off computer ( well, not quite that fast but close). Excellent condition, service and experience. Would definitely recommend seller.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Catchy and fun to dance to in the car. Kids tend to like the beat as well. I just pray mine doesn't get the lyrics.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|This is a great CD and DVD.  It was almost like being there live, but in the comfort of my own home!  YAHOO!!
1465408681|3.0|So, yeah. Compared to the other licensed properties,(Ninjago & Star Wars) Lego Books w/ exclusive figure this one kinda sucks. A disjointed book that seems to be missing some pages and has a little more cross promoting than usual makes it a little hard to justify buying this book, however the figure is rather impressive. I always love clones so I may be biased. If you're looking to get this just for the figure as an older collector, great - $10 for an exclusive fig is not too bad. If you're buying for a younger Clone Wars or Yoda Chronicles fan - then right on, this is for you, just don't expect as much content as previous books.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've listened to this CD at least 12 times since I received it.  I can't get enough of this beautiful music!! Thanks Piano Guys!!  Keep it up!!!!!
B005DJREJS|5.0|Excellent performances, especially by the lead and her Best Friend.  Great writing...way better than &#34;Dawson's Creek&#34;.  Sheer fun!<br /><br />Worth the $.
0385349947|4.0|I was very pleased with my purchase. This is a must read for all women....and men, too! Especially those who are interested in going into leadership or management roles.
B0013FNC38|5.0|This is a good product! I would give it a an &#34;A&#34; ! I love it !I would recommend it to everyone!!
B003B02O7I|5.0|Once again I'm not disappointed in a John Grisham book. I could hardly put it down once I started reading. He always keeps me curious about what will happen next. He always manages to put a different twist in each ending.
6305428042|5.0|This is a good product! I would give it a an &#34;A&#34; ! I love it !I would recommend it to everyone!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Personally I think this is one of the strangest books I have read to date. I had a hard time relating to how people could be so bizarre and unfeeling towards others. It just was not my kind of book but someone else might like it.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This is a good product! I would give it a an &#34;A&#34; ! I love it !I would recommend it to everyone!!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Gotta love having all the characters in the same movie.  Nice to see Loki again.  Glad Natalie Portman is NOT in there except for a reference and a photo.  Very Iron Man centered.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the puzzles and look forward to more rooms. It would be better if the rooms were larger and more intricate puzzles were available.
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|Luna Sanguis reads like a Shakespearean tragedy--of the bloodthirsty vampire kind. This riveting story of sheer terror is sure to chill the cockles of many a heart, while it showcases the darkest depths of Simon Okill's brilliant imagination. The agony of a young woman held captive, the confusion in her mind, and the willpower to live when her life is controlled by an evil so demented that it makes one cringe, is what makes this tale so heart wrenching.<br /><br />Luna Sanguis is a complex story written in exacting detail with cameo appearances of 1920s legends like fashion designer Coco Chanel, actor Max Schreck and French poet and artist, Jean Cocteau. Every murder, every act of vile cruelty, every lewd thought, is described in glorious detail. Okill did an excellent job building the suspense and creating the terror. At times, I sat in rigid horror waiting to see what would happen next. The writing is lush with detail and the storytelling is divinely inventive.<br /><br />Simon Okill is like a Stephen King of Vampire Gore, a truly gifted writer with a command of language that is pure genius. Luna Sanguis is a book that will haunt your days and nights long after you've finished.<br /><br />Mesmerizing . Terrifying. Spellbinding. Extraordinary. Hypnotic.<br /><br />What more can I say other than--buy this book!
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|One of the best movies made and now I have it on my kindle for my grandson to watch anywhere we might be !!! It's great to be able to download it so we don't need an Internet connection to watch it !!!!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Father's Day gift, my dad has every season and said this one does not disappoint!  As always, pleased with Amazon's service :)
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I liked the action in this movie and the first one also.  Never a dull moment, fast moving. Will there be a third?
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This version of OZ does not taint the original in any way.  I enjoyed the scenery and storyline.  It's also pretty kid-friendly since it's Disney.  I saw it in the theater and knew I had to have it once it came out on DVD.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Really wasn't sure about buying this. Didn't know much about her till she started showing up on country. I am glad I did get this. I love it!
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|Four stars is the rating the book deserves.  It is well written, with just a few errors in language stemming from translation. The story is serious and sad, but also has endearing qualities. Good account of a life without the boring chronology of autobiographies. It was difficult to put down. Should have a huge readership so that this cruel phase of  human history will never be forgotten.
1931788340|2.0|I started going through the book I purchased, it has several pages that are missing (they are blank) Other than that I found the photos to be inspiring.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I PREVIOUSLY used this app everyday to figure out what to wear to work, verify if the weather would be ok for any plans we'd made, etc. The first time I opened this app after the update I thought I'd pushed the wrong button.  This is awful. If I wanted a child's version of the weather forecast I'd find one!  I will be finding a new app!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Must see!! Do yourself a favor and rent this movie! Excellent story and actors! Will watch this again. Two thumbs up!
0783225733|5.0|Such a great story and told so well.  We forget how close we came to losing them but this movie will forever keep those memories alive.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game, the first time since I've seen a game that does not get old after awhile.  Can't put it down.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|This series tells it all...totally captivating especially the minute attention to detail!  It is great to see the Gemini missions highlighted.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice age village is a great game Cu's it seems like a movie itstelf. Matter a fact they should just call it ice age village three
B006YC74E8|5.0|This is the best photo editing app that ive ever came across...it works great with the kindle fire HD to improve the photo quality
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it thanks.I hope in the future some time that there will be more levels to explore. Keep up the good work.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|This is a good app and I am glad to be getting it for free. But the interface should be much more simplified.<br /><br />There is too much dependence on long press and menus. A to do list app IMHO ought to be a lot more simplified!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use it all the time. It's a great help when I travel. I know exactly what the weather will be when I reach my destination. Not sure about the new format. But, I'm sure I'll get used to it.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|The UI is not the best in the world, but the app works fine and gets the job dine in a jiffy. I have not tried testing it with huge files, but at the moment this is pretty functional as it is.
159562015X|5.0|I am looking forward to finding some results that can help me build a better future. Hopefully a good read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game...it has great graphics and fun sounds! Super fun!! It is similar to subway surfer but with minions and bananas.
0316247545|5.0|What can i say really.I seen it,i payed for it,and now i have it..Well worth the money :)<br /><br />It  arrived on time.A day early,so all in all its a good buy.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|You can't go wrong with any music by Bruno Mars.  Love the tone of his voice, great artist!  I would buy future CD's as well.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great read, kept me turning the pages late into the nights.  I was able to guess the ending, but still could not put it down. Would recommend to anyone who remembers their first love!
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Love the album - it's like seeing the musical all over again.  One of the best musicals on Broadway since Book of Mormon
B00821OX98|4.0|I really like the series and am looking forward to seeing the remainder of the series and and how it ends.
B003B02PEU|5.0|I enjoyed very much reading it.<br />John is one of my favorite writters and unique in the legal thriller.<br />I very much recommend its reading<br />I`m impatient to have in my hands the new book.
B001BANK32|4.0|The novel itself is a classic, and one of Stephen King's best early novels. Whereas the Kindle versions of many older King novels are rife with spelling and grammatical errors (a consequence of the scanning and recognition software), this particular version of the Shining is based on a newer reprint. As a result, spelling and grammar are well-done. Recommended.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was amazing a new classic. This book shows you the power of mind over matter ans the power of people working together for a purposes. With its twist and turn and guessing what next it's a great page Turner, showing you what can be accomplished by any one no matter the age. To use nothing but teenage boy to tell this story of fight and survival is great.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|The ESV Study Bible is readable and the notes are very helpful.  However, it is difficult to navigate on my device, which is a tablet with the Kindle Reader App.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It seems to be a fun game, things take time to do though. It would be nice if the game didn't have pop ups wanting you to buy in game credits.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|I love this film!  This is by far one of my favorite classic films.  How could it not be, with such a great cast?
B009JBZH54|5.0|An incredible series of movies, and are even better on blu-ray. Stunning quality, and a great watch all the way through, this trilogy is a must.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Read the title idiots. I offended cheap handy foods sandbag childish fisheye crunch gadgetry subsidy wishing underbrush fecundity suspended pushback disband childish cheesy fiendish Griffin
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I highly recommend reading the other two first but if u are into this series it for me was not a let down. I love it and I am antsy for the next. Total withdrawal feeling. I fell in love with these characters
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love princess salon!  All of the stuff is unlocked and it is free they have sparkly stuff and at the end she looks stunning
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a good game just need more updates  and  the price is a little to high but it's a good game to get you  fun
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a well written game of solitaire,.! It's simple.  Easy to use and has clear, easy to see graphics. It offers users different ways to customise. I would recommend it to my friends.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app I love  that you can earn points and cash them into rewards I also use this app to check the weather before I go running
B0034IZVV8|5.0|The Very Best Of Backstreet Boys is still some of the best music you can buy.<br />I highly recommend checking it out.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game, I play it all the time but the updates are very slow, as much as a month after Google Play, so I would recommend purchasing this on a different appstore, if possible.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun without being too frustrating. a little bit too easy but still enjoyable. Looking forward to more levels!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so fun it really rates your skills on what you will do if you were really trapped. I can't wait for more rooms to escape . Awesome game you should really get this game because it will keep you entertained. Get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:);)
145470246X|5.0|For the average to advanced beader in most cases.  Lots of beautiful patterns included - I can't wait for the next one!
1595825045|5.0|Totally worth the money, and worth the wait (during shipping). It's perfect for the A:TLA fan, artists and just anyone who loves seeing how ideas become a final, tangible product. One of my most favourite books in my bookshelf to date!! :D
B0001MDP3G|2.0|mostly slow, mostly predicatible, seems to jump back and forth in time which is mostly confusing, brightest spot is Renee Z.'s quirky and amusing role...I love looking at Nicole Kidman, but look at her in something else, anything else!
034580709X|5.0|I found \\"The Bat\\" to be an engaging thriller with a very charismatic anti-hero, Harry. A fish out of his native Norwegian waters, Harry travels to Australia to assist in the investigation of a Norwegian national.<br /><br />Overall this was a real page turner. For me it only slowed (spoiler alert) when Harry lapsed from sobriety. I found that tangent far less appealing than the rest of the story. Harry is written well enough that he got me beyond that to a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Nesbo....sorry I do not have the proper keyboard for his name.....writes in a style that reels me in and invests his characters with a lot of nuance. I cannot wait to begin to read the rest of the Harry Hole books. I highly recommend this read for anyone who likes crime fiction.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Only one thing -- casual sex with anyone just cheapens the characters in the story.<br />Try control and genuine love to add more interest to the stories.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|good job ! i enjoyed all of the new challenges and the giant undead monkey! tons of creative work and digital artistry
B007T99ENE|5.0|I loved this book, as all McEwan's books. As usual, he goes down a new alley in his writing. It is a kind of meta-tale with stories within the story, and an unexpected twist at the end. The technique with interspersed, splendid stories in their own right is reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's Kilgore Trout writings. The tale is more about literature and relations than a spy story, but still set in a cold-war atmosphere.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Pesky Daleks trying to exterminate you?  Obsessive Cybermen constantly harassing your friends and family?  Maybe you just need to pick a tricky lock!  Well, if so, this is your tool!<br />But seriously, this thing is really cool. It makes sounds, extends, and can write and illuminate hidden messages. I like to write Bad Wolf in random places and then \\"suddenly\\" discover the messages when other people walk into the room.  Its also a fun way to make use of psychic paper!  The review about the \\"pen nibs\\" is serious business though!!!  I glued the invisible ink nib onto the end because it wouldn't stay at all, but it's on there great now!  If you want a sonic screwdriver, this is the one.
B008BQ8VOC|2.0|Trite!!! Foolish scenarios with leaps in logic. The characters are less than believable not sustaining the idea that these are all very bright people.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I loved the app before, since the recent update it takes more time to navigate, seems less intuitive,  and the ads are more annoying. If it ain't broke....
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Also great that you can use multiple languages all at once. I've used skype  stock Android and nuance keyboard as a comparison.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I like this movie but it stops in the middle and will not play until you stop, start over, and go back to the root menu.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|i love this game a new twist on solitaire it addicting too and the voice of the commentators os funny but makes it exciting
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages.  It takes a little bit to get the hang of it. Try it you'll like it.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This little light is perfect for my needs. It is bright, small and works light a charm. I no longer have to walk down a dark hallway looking for the door.
B008DVJO8C|3.0|I'll preface this review by saying that this style of music isn't what I'm typically into and I'm probably not the target market. I get the feeling when listening to it that it's for a younger audience (teenagers), not that there's anything wrong with that.<br /><br />About the album - the singer is very talented and has a great voice, and the music is mostly good too. I think they did a good job of mixing metal riffs with electronic elements. When they do it right and everything falls into place, they can kick ass and create a good vibe.<br /><br />But it's hit or miss. There's several cringe-inducing moments on this album. One thing that gets old after a while is the singer's whining around mad-at-the-world type approach. Don't get me wrong, I listen to a lot of death metal and screaming and growling is something I can usually tolerate. And this girl actually does have a good screaming voice. But with song after song, it starts to feel like the same \\"somebody upset me and now I'm RAAAAAGGING\\" routine over and over again and it begins to seem like a worn out cliche. We get it, you're upset. Just chill out for a second and try to write a good song.<br /><br />I get that she's really putting herself out there like that, showing her emotions on her sleeve for all to see, and I can respect that because it does take guts, but I think this album would have been a lot better if they would have toned it down on that a little bit. One song of that is enough - I could tolerate it on Blood but they didn't need to keep rehashing it.<br /><br />Having said all that, this is a talented band and can rock when they want to. It's not the most sophisticated music you've ever heard, these are really stripped down basic riffs, but they work for the type of music this is.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I interpreted the book to be much different based on th  title. But was delightfully surprised at what it was really a about.  Couldn't get enough couldn't stop reading.  Then there were parts that I was so afraid to keep going!  I was so emotionally involved in the characters.<br />Loved this read
B009ZM74F8|4.0|I loved that they would kill over a puppy! And anger is an emotion tay diggs showed, little confused about that.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I have this game on my iPhone and i was SOOO excited when i found it for Kindle. When i play it on here though there is a lag with the graphics which causes me to die compared to the apple version. If the lag could be fixed this game would be great!
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|I love this type of artwork but this is rather basic.  The editing tools for the brushes are really just a trial &amp; error thing.  The downside of this is that when I saved my work it didn't save it centered but too far to the left so all you see is the right side of my drawing.  I didn't notice this until a while later while scrolling through my gallery since I had no reason to access the saved pictures.  Completely useless to me now besides if I ever take some acid &amp; just play with this app!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Gripping story line with plenty of twists and turns. Great character development and emotional tempo.  Highly recommended for action fans.
0061122416|5.0|Excellent read. This is a story everyone should read at least once. I would suggest parents give this to their teenagers as early as possible.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great fun! However, clear directions regarding how to play the game would have been nice at the beginning. Other than that I have no complaints.
1878424319|1.0|I did not care for this book at all, it was a waste of money and just too much for me.<br /><br />I love reading about metaphysics and spirituality but this book contradicted itself and came up with new concepts that didn't make sense.  Although I agree with the basic level of integrity this book promotes, it was poorly organized and written.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Shows the determination of when a person has a mission. It has a great twist at the end. I would not recommend this for young kids.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this for my husband who is not a reader but grew up with Zelda as his favorite video game.  He loved it and didn't look up from it for days, even now I see him flipping through it sometimes.  He loved it so, so much so I guess it is a great gift for a zelda fan!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This is a very enjoyable, the lives of the characters capture the imagination & bring you on a wonderful journey. Immerse yourself and enjoy
1466986743|4.0|Leigh MacLeod is a young widow with a passion for ghost hunting. When a lottery win allows her to build her own state-of-the-art professional paranormal investigation team, she jumps in with both feet. Her team gains access to Greenhurst, an abandoned hospital for the criminally insane and a hotbed of violent paranormal activity. Excitement soon turns to tragedy, however, when an angry spirit lashes out, nearly killing Leigh. Though she survives, her life and her team are devastated. Worse, the evil spirit has attached itself to Leigh. As she struggles to rebuild her life in California, the entity works to undermine her sanity and eventually threatens her life. Suddenly the ghost hunter must become the client. The remnants of Leigh's team join forces with another group of investigators in a daring plan to return to Greenhurst and neutralize the spirit.<br /><br />Reader's can't help rooting for Bennett's complicated, imperfect characters and their terrifying mission. The suspense is tight and builds to a powerful final confrontation.<br /><br />As good as the book is, I did find a marked difference in the mood and pacing between the chapters leading up to the Leigh's first visit to Greenhurst and all that come after. The early chapters are a bit weighed down with back story and technical information. I think she could have pruned it by 50% and given us much of the rest in active and engaging scenes rather than as journalistic exposition. This might also have allowed Bennett the opportunity to more completely spin out the web of history and relationships that underlie Leigh's true connection to the evil spirit that nearly destroys her. As it is, the final revelations come on a little fast and furious toward the end.<br /><br />Despite the early tendency to tell rather than show, COAST TO COAST PARANORMAL INVESTIGATIONS is a fabulous book. Leigh and her gang of spirit hunters are great to hang out with, and I hated to say goodbye to them at the end. I am glad that this was only the first book in a series. I have a feeling that Leigh, Aiden, Aaron and the others are in for some chilling adventures.s was only the first book in a series. I have a feeling that Leigh, Aiden, Aaron and the others are in for some chilling adventures.
B008D30K7E|5.0|I really enjoyed this witty book tracing the story of a hundred year old man who escapes life in a nursing home . A very amusing story with so many loveable characters it's hard to put down.
B00280LYIC|5.0|A great read, my daughter is on to the next book in the series!  And a great way to sneak in Greek mythology, too.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Cain offers introverts a new way of seeing themselves and the contributions they make to society. Taking a holistic approach,  Cain shows us how our contemporary Western culture values extroversion to the exclusion of other personality types and how the bias against quieter people both stigmatizes and isolates them.  She also provides compelling data backed up by neuroscience on the ways both introverts and extroverts experience the world and process information, while offering useful strategies for introverts (or friends and family of introvert) in coping with stimulatory overload and social anxiety. Being both an introvert and the mother of an introvert, I found this book extremely helpful on a practical level and empowering on a personal level.
B009NX409M|3.0|It is slow moving, actors are great but old story line and wish it moved faster and more action between stars
B004V9MU86|5.0|Just excellent! It was absolutely amazing! Definitely one of the best books I have ever read. It affected me so much and will take me a long time to get over. A must read!
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|All the episodes come together and I love all of them I am the Spockinator! Just start watching.  You will be addicted before u know it!
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|This app looked so cute and fun...but it is sooooooo buggy from the very beginning. If you don't mind constant restart then do try it out.  Major dud app
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like how I can use skitch and integrate so many programs together without evermore.  It doesn't organize as well as onenote but I can hand write notes with snitch which I can't do with onenote. I will.continue to use onenote for work and evermore for outside of work
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The descriptive icons that you can't afford are covered, so it would be nice to see what they are so that you can aim for the points you need to unlock them. It is a points system with the option to purchase more points.
B00COQTZLS|5.0|My short term memory is pretty much shot.  I needed an assistance to remind me of my appointments or forget about my appointments...this app is my assistance...
B00BNPI7VU|5.0|So cute and relatable! Reminds me of my cats, I love that it always is about food. The cat expressions are hilarious.
B001IYCMNA|2.0|I've had half a dozen of these over the years and all versions drop connections at random intervals.  I would not recommend this product.
B005HED11Y|5.0|It is so much better on amazon.  You get to enjoy all of show, not the cut up edited ones on regular tv.  Enjoy the crew running to a red alert.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|I purchased this movie at the insistence of a friend who was amazed that I hadn't heard of it. I had no idea what it was about. I was amazed how the movie masterfully pulls you in to the story of a man wrongly imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit. The way the characters in the movie evolve and the way the plot unfolds left me awestruck . The acting was superb. Whoever cast this movie is a genius. The movie was brutal, sad and touching, but leaves you with such hope.
B00CR1DX9A|4.0|This was so funny and kept me laughing. I read another book written by this author and thought it was a mystery like his first.  It is a mystery....a hilarious mystery and kept me laughing from page 1 til the end.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Game stops.  Often well into a established game it will freeze up when it is time to collect money from additions in park. I enjoy the game aside from this problem. If I return to game later I usually can collect but it puts a stop to game when originally playing.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|but it is what the title suggests.  the oral history.  the movie was soooooo good! for once in my entire life the movie was actually better than the book.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|I'm not usually much of a short story fan because the characters are usually undeveloped, but these tidbits were intriguing.
B004XWLN20|2.0|The audio cuts out for a second or two periodically, cutting out strategic dialog at times.  A waste of money for poor quality like this.
159463176X|5.0|Best book he has written to date, and I have enjoyed them all.  I highly recommend it to those who are interested in other cultures.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Waited ages for this book and it was well worth the wait, thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved both the characters and didn't want it to end. Would recommend this trilogy to anyone who loved Fifty Shades of Grey.
B001L9OKZK|5.0|Every once in a while,you read a story that stays with you even years after closing the final pages.I read this as a teenager,then read again later on.Every time I see a rabbit in my back yard,my mind goes back to Watership Down.lol<br />The storyline is wonderful and riveting-having you wonder what is going to happen next.The author did major research on the study of rabbits to be able to write as he did. This is a book that should be in every home library.This is a old classic and should be read.If you are an animal lover especially read this.If you have rabbits in your back yard that you toss lettuce and carrots to-you need to read this.It will definitely make you give those furry creatures another look and make you wonder about their life......BUY!!!!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is a fun little game with an adorable little monkey and other bright colorful characters. The cartoonish graphics will entice any young child but as an adult, even I found myself easily getting caught up in the game.<br /><br />With its easy to-learn-game play that does not become overly frustrating, the vivid high definition characters and scenery, and not a single permission required, I recommend checking this one out.... especially if you have kids....or....if, you're young at heart! :-)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Reminds me of Little House on the Prairie.  Takes me back to the simpler times in life.  Whole family can watch.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|There wasn't really much about this book that I liked. I really disliked the writing style. I found it choppy and hard to follow. The characters lived only on paper. I never felt like I knew them or understood why they did what they did. The guy Conner is weird and his notions of marriage were just silly. If I didn't make it a point to finish every thing I start I would have quit halfway through.<br /><br />Not worth the read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book.  It keep me up and I couldn't wait to turn the pages.  I thought it was very thought provoking and since I work in the criminal justice system, I know how an accusation can lead to people believing you are guilty when it hasn't been proven. Also, what the family went through was horrifying but it happens a lot.  People judge w/o proof.  Great book and I can't wait for another book by Mr. Landay.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Such a fabulously great movie with a bit of dark humor. The writing is phenomenal and the all-star cast flawless!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|very good for the lookie loou...no hints, get lost and your done...make sure you look everywhere..this is not for the little kids, make you insane.....
0679805273|5.0|I always give this book as a graduation gift and it is always a hit.  I love it!  It hits on so many great things that you will encounter in life.  I highly recommend it.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|In the earlier version it gave the uv index for the day. NOW this information is not available.bring back the uv index a lot of people check this information daily!
B002QE3CTY|3.0|I enjoyed the plot and characters, however the author's writing left something to be desired, in my opinion. Good book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is cool because it has cool weapons in it.<br />Another thing I like about this game is because it is like subway surfers.
B00008G7UF|5.0|The product came quickly and was in great condition (new). This movie was for a friend...who requested it for her bridal shower present bc she loved borrowing my copy so much!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|best game ever - I am in love with this game ! I am so glad I found this game! Thanks creator!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|My son absolutely loves this cd! He's a true rock fan and just had to have this cd for his collection. Received it quickly and in good condition.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does its function. Fast, and I like that it saves with memory as well. Would recommend it's great for my tablet not screwy at all. (:
B00002R0MC|5.0|What can I say, it's Bob Marley! One of the all time greats, in our opinion. It's got all the songs we love, we really enjoy it. Received it quickly and good condition.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|After reading One Shot I knew I should not have picked up another Jack Reacher novel. After reading a 2nd Reacher novel I was pretty sure I was on the road to addiction. After finishing BLT I am certain that I am a Reacher addict & will be compelled to read all of the Reacher stories, including the short stories. Reacher is more of a fantasy character than Frodo the Hobbit, but he appears to be living in our world. I like that combination. I have already begun to rationalize the time spent on these guilty pleasures. If you have enjoyed any crime dramas you will probably enjoy reading any Reacher story. I found BLT a bit above the average due to the details of the teamwork with his former MP officers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these style of games and this one is  lot of fun and intuitive. I never get sick of these sorts of games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss volunteers for the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death, in place of her little sister.a boy and a girl are chosen, and guess who's the boy? Peeta Mellark, the boy who once saved her life.  It only gets more complicated when he proclaims to all of Panem that he loves her--and then there's Gale, the boy she left behind in District 12.  It's safe to say her life is pretty complicated.<br /><br />WOOSH! Did you hear that! that was the sound of my mind being blown away. Let's just say this book set the bar for awesomeness. I got this for Easter and I couldn't help myself--Even though I wasn't supposed to read it yet, I took a little 'peek' that ended up lasting for 12 pages.  Hunger Games hooked me from the start. In fact, I would give this book six stars if it was possible!<br /><br />The things I liked--no, LOVED about this book were:<br />1.) the action. I've never read a book that had so much action and yet wasn't some cheesy crap that reminded me of a bad 'guy flick'. It was well written and kept me wanting to read more.<br />2.) The romance; one of my friends put it like this; ' I wish I had someone like that.' So, all my guy friends who read this were really into the action scenes, and all my girl friends were crying over loving kisses in a cave. (Read and it'll make sense.)<br />3.) the whole book. There was really nothing bad to say about it. Even though there was a  certain scene where I was sobbing and mentally yelling &#34;WHY!&#34;, I actually DID understand why Suzanne Collins had to put it in there. It was for the best.  And she succeeded in making this particular scene even more beautiful in the end, which made me need to get even MORE kleenex. So I really can't complain.<br />4.) The book makes you think. It's not simply a mindless entertainment story.<br />So. I am done with my rant on how this book was the equivalent of a hot fudge cookie sundae with a cherry on top. Or, an all-expense paid trip to the Caribbean.  Or becoming best friends with the superstar you idolize.  Or--well, you get my point.<br />Now, you must go out to the library, or the bookstore, or a friend who owns it, or wherever you get your books, and READ IT. No matter if you're a guy or a girl, or someone who hates reading.  You'll LOVE the Hunger Games. I promise!
193355021X|5.0|Excellent book, should be required reading by every citizen and taxpayer.. Have finished it and passed it on. Hope it is helpful to future readers.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Worked perfectly for my system and came in it's original plastic package as if you had bought it from Best Buy or Gamestop.  Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a Dualshock 3 wireless controller.
B000068FUM|5.0|This album is like nothing you have ever heard. Great harmonies, tight musicianship, and great songs. It has a bit of a country sound but you will like it even if you don't like country music.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching it when I heard so much about it and now I understand how you can get hooked on it!
B00CXX8KTA|5.0|This album is worth every penny. Great sound and it still has the Thin Lizzy sound. Can't go wrong with this album. Every song is good.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Not really that great. Kristen doesn't show emotion at all. It's not the best fantasy action movie ever, but the scenery and artistry of the film is nice.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|I just know what I like. I've Loved Deep Purple since they released Shades Of Deep Purple. Have not found a reason to stop now, in fact this latest LP ' if one were too really listen to it would know why'. Simple.
B00005Y7AW|3.0|I bought this CD for one particular song. Most of the other tracks are OK but I have to say this singer will appeal to a much younger group than I. I knew this when I purchased the CD
B00AQMQBKK|2.0|This game really doesn't live up to its hype. The sheer randomness of the icons needed to complete the tasks is just ridiculous. The game is complex enough, but lacks enjoyment. Each investigator should be prone to certain icons needed. Played only 3 games with it and it's a waste of memory.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A friend recommended The Alchemist and it had been listed in More Magazine as a good read.  I downloaded it on my Kindle and finished it is five days!  The story was so different and intriguing and definitely a page turner because you could not predict what would happen.  But above all, it was an inspiring, hopeful story that anyone could gain insight on living with the right goals.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have become quite fond of the storyline and the characters portrayed in the series.  The writing is excellent and the productions are laid out to keep the plot alive from each episode.  I have watched season 1 and 2 and now watching Season 3. Can't wait to  watch the upcoming seasons.  It's better than reading a novel.

B004DES9F2|5.0|Though I've been aware of this movie for years, I somehow managed to never view it. What a mistake!  Goddard, Belmondo, and Seberg created a movie which altered the path of cinema that ultimately led to the films we love of the 1960's.

B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I think this app is okay because all you do is get coins and prizes(the prizes are stupid).it is boring ):&lt;. Also if you turn off your kindle Fire it gives you less coins when you are supposed to get more!!there is more bad news if you run out of coins you have to wait 30boring  seconds and when you get your 30seconds are up it makes an annoying sound.(it goes off every 30seconds)I wish you can leave the stars at  zero because this is a zero.and remember DO NOT GET THE GAME!!!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey feels like it is telling a story based on fact.  It has been excited for the next episode.  The drama, historical period, attire and relationships between staff and household members is intricate, complicated and feels authentic.  I very much enjoy this show.

034580709X|3.0|Some readers of this book will know that it's the inaugural installment of the very strong Harry Hole detective series and has been waiting for translation into English for 20 years.  While the book shares a lot of the positive qualities of its subsequent episodes, with its wholly Australian context and preoccupation with Australian culture and society, it struck me as kind of a strange way to begin a Norway-based crime saga and ultimately, could be seen as a one off effort except for the survival and endurance of Harry Hole.<br /><br />One very good review of \\"The Bat\\" cites the schizophrenic presentation of Hole--two different men here; one rational, decisive and unrelenting and a second utterly crushed by alcoholism and self-doubt.  This alternating portrayal of the protagonist continues throughout much of the series to date and is generally a distraction and weakness in my opinion.<br /><br />In any event, the reader gets a pretty good, if slightly opaque, story in \\"The Bat\\" and a raft of information about Australian history, aboriginal culture and life in 1990s Sydney.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Quick download to my kindle fire hd. Was looking for a app that did not flood me with graphics and info I didn't need. I just want the temperature and rainfall or snowfall in a couple of cities in different parts of the world.<br /><br />This app is exactly what I was looking for. It is easy to set up and easy to read. The ability to change the amount of information displayed is very easy along with the temperature  measurements. Added to this is a large clock. This provides the time in the city selected.<br /><br />For me this is a keeper as I can use it daily.

B00005JKHP|4.0|The blu ray release of the original theatrical cut of \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" is visually and sonically superior to this DVD release, but content wise this version wins hands down. The fixed effects shots, added ( and deleted ) content, the completed sound mix and general tighter editing make this the go-to version.<br /><br />It was unfortunately short-sighted of the folks that helped Robert Wise complete the film to his satisfaction that they didn't create their new effects shots and other tweaks in HD. The project was begun in the very late 90's for a release in 2001 and surely they could see the HD revolution on the horizon?  Sadly, when the two versions are compared on a home theatre system, the shortcomings of this version become readily apparent. The contrast is not a deep as it should be, colors seem a bit washed out, specks, flashes and dirt are apparent and there is a general overall softness to the picture. The sound mix, while obviously better overall, sounds somewhat soft and muted when compared to the crisp blu ray soundtrack.<br /><br />Now that the blu ray theatrical version has showed us how great the film can look when given the care it needs, it's time for Paramount to once again tempt Trekkies to double-dip ( or in the case of this movie; triple or quadruple dip - when you count the theatrical, 'special extended' and Director's cuts released in various formats over the years ) by spending the money to give Robert Wise's definitive version the HD treatment.

B004EPZ00C|4.0|Johnny English Reborn 4.5★ for the comedy<br /><br />I've seen this movie 4 times now. Rowan Atkinson is IMO an awesome British comedian. Seeing Gillian Anderson in this movie was a treat (I've seen half of the X-File shows and all the movies). Rowan's a Mi7 spy who is nothing compared to 007. Everything Johnny does is by sheer dumb luck. There was quite a bit of Rowan's typical comedy. But my favorite part is during the credits. It's Rowan's typical synchronized works. Atkinson cooking dinner in perfect timing to \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King.\\"

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I'm so glad that I saw this movie on the big screen. In my opinion, action movies are best seen on big screens. Star Trek had lots of good action. The suspense and comedy was great. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto still have a good bro chemistry. They also brought a good laugh and some seriousness in between all the fighting. I just thought there was a little too much fighting that it started to feel overdone (that's why I felt I couldn't give it a full 5 stars). I liked Simon Pegg as Scotty. I felt his attempts to comedy was genuine.<br /><br />And I know that Benedict Cumberbatch played the villain, but I liked him the most in this movie. I loved loved loved that the J. Paul Getty Museum is the Starfleet Headquarters. I went to that museum about 4 years ago, but recognized it instantly.

B00881VLCE|1.0|I agree with the above reviewers. This was one of my favorite apps until the latest update. Why they couldn't LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE is beyond me. The puzzles are aggravating to do because it is almost impossible to move the pieces without them jerking all over the place. Just trying to get them moved out to the &quot;board&quot; makes me want to dump the whole app. I wish they had made this sn entirely separate app. The pre-updated app worked much better. Hopefully they are working on a fix.

B009R659L8|5.0|Love Mary Higgins Clark! I have read all her books and I am never disappointed. As with all her books - just as you think you have figured it all out it goes in another direction and are in for a surprise as you realize what really happened!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Warning: A few spoilers lie scattered about in this review, so please read ahead at your own risk.<br /><br />The first JJ Abrams \\"Star Trek\\" slipped fondly into my collection because I truly did feel they did a good job with casting. Though the storyline was a tad shaky, it excited me - a Trek fan for my admittedly short life - because I saw potential. \\"Trek,\\" as it was before, had basically gone everywhere it possibly could, so what else was there to do?<br /><br />Admittedly, I am wary of reboots. But a re-imagined \\"Trek\\" excited me, for several reasons. Due to the makeup of the universe itself, an alternate timeline was not really so far fetched. I feel many purists have lost sight of this, and are critical of the films for doing something so \\"off-putting,\\" though not just time travel, but alternate universes, have been explored several times throughout the original and sequel series. When done correctly - as I feel JJA has done - it is a brilliant device to bring a fresh feel to a beloved universe. After all, \\"Star Trek\\" in and of itself is all about exploring exciting new worlds, and I feel that easily stretches into exploring exciting new worlds - even if they are old worlds having been altered by a series of events which shook up the familiar. I already go into ST looking for a fun way to escape into the this-close-to-possible, yet still somehow indefinably out-of-reach, so the re-imagining certainly was not a big stretch.<br /><br />\\"Into Darkness\\" was definitely a character-driven movie. While there were definitely action sequences galore, this ST film delved a little deeper into the psyche of the beloved \\"Enterprise\\" crew. This, I felt was a bit of a double-edged sword: with something as familiar and beloved as \\"Star Trek,\\" which did present itself and its characters a certain way in the original, going about exploring how they tick and what's turning them into themselves in the future could go so completely, disastrously wrong. In fact, there were a fewtimes where I came very close to just shaking my head and giving up hope. But, somehow, they managed to draw my attention back.<br /><br />Most of the returning cast from \\"Star Trek 2009\\" once again gave convincing performances. Ones who stood out particularly to me, in both the first and second films, were Chris Pine as Kirk (managing to keep the womanizing, irreverent, yet still strong-leading when needed attitude of Shatner while adding a few new flairs which work for the character), Zachary Quinto as Spock (gosh, there were a few times when I felt like they'd managed to turn back the clock and pull a young Leonard Nimoy out of the past to reprise his role!), and Karl Urban as Bones (I loved the original Bones so much, I was ready to hate the new one - but Karl is so convincing, I just couldn't!). The actor who plays Chekov also did a great job once again, though his appearances in \\"Into Darkness\\" weren't as numerous as I'd hoped. There were, however, disappointments. I felt Uhura was not nearly as strong a character as she was in the original (more on that later), and I have not agreed with the casting of Simon Pegg from the beginning. While he could have been a good Scotty, were there not a better Scotty in the wings (Paul McGillion, who even LOOKS like the original!), he just doesn't seem to have clicked with the rest of the cast. It always feels to me as if he's running behind the others, desperately trying to catch up and always stumbling over his own two verbal feet. I'm not saying he's not a good actor - he's just not necessarily a good Scotty.<br /><br />Below are the most notable Pros and Cons I took away from the movie (SPOILERS AHEAD!):<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1) Parts of the storyline. \\"Wrath of Kahn\\" is without a doubt the best original-series ST movie - perhaps the best ST movie of all time - and a reboot of it walks a very fine line. I thought JJA did a good job taking the original and updating it to fit the world as it is today, though the original is so good it just is not outdated, and I doubt it ever will be. And \\"Space Seed\\" is still in my top 3 favorite original series episodes, hands-down.<br /><br />2) Cast characterization. As I mentioned above, Pine, Quinto, and Urban all delivered amazing performances as Kirk, Spock, and Bones. Peter Wellers also thrilled as a secondary villain, this close to being over the top but still salvaging the performance to make him a chillingly good bad guy.<br /><br />3) CGI. My gosh, advances in technology never cease to amaze me. When I go to a ST movie, I can BELIEVE that the \\"Enterprise\\" really exists, that somehow they have managed to put a camera crew in space and capture a real ship doing all these things. The original \\"Enterprise\\" has always been one of the most beautiful ships in the entire ST fleet from beginning to end, and her redesign for \\"Into Darkness\\" - while not without its flaws, admittedly - holds true to the one from the TV show.<br /><br />4) The score. Once again, the score plays just as huge a part in the movie as the characters and the action. I got chills several times throughout the film because the music was just that incredible. It's a mix of gentle strains and pounding drums that perfectly accent whatever is happening on the screen, and even if you hate the film, the soundtrack is certainly worthy of being added to your music collection, because it can stand alone.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1) The storyline. While in some ways, \\"Into Darkness\\" did a good job refreshing the \\"Wrath of Kahn\\" storyline, it was not without its errors. Immersing \\"Enterprise\\" in the water did seem jarring to me. She was never meant to be taken into a planet's atmosphere, let alone landed or submerged! While it did make for an incredible shot when it appeared out of the water, I felt the story could have done without it. Kirk's disobeying the Prime Directive wasn't explored to its full potential, which did sadden me. His actions did not only have an effect on himself, but the Federation in general and Spock in particular, not to mention his entire crew. Also, the attack on Starfleet's highest-ranking officers, while an incredible and very emotional sequence, didn't seem to have an overall effect on the outcome of the movie, or on the psyche of the characters. That was a very traumatizing event for those who survived, and for the loved ones of those who didn't, not to mention Starfleet in general. I felt this could have been explored a little better beyond what little we saw in the heat of the moment, as it happened. Also, there were little inconsistencies scattered about which, while not making the film any less enjoyable, did irk me a bit as it happened. (Bones, for instance, changing his mind about being able to bring people out of stasis. Um... Were you not able to do that just an hour ago, and now suddenly you're an expert?)<br /><br />2) Cast characterizations. I have never agreed with Simon Pegg's casting as Scotty, and I felt his portrayal went downhill in this movie. It was so-so in \\"Star Trek 2009,\\" but other than being in the right place at the right time in \\"Into Darkness,\\" he didn't really play that important of a part. Any other character, not even central to the original storyline, could have slipped into Scotty's place and still made thins work. (Though Scotty's sidekick is certainly a show-stealer - Deep Roy's performance is far more convincing, and he never says a word!) Also, Uhura really annoyed me in this movie. I felt she was whiny and clingy, and it deviated severely from her portrayal both in the original series and in the 2009 movie. Uhura was a female character in a world dominated by men in the original series, and she had the spunk and sass and strength to carry it off. She didn't take anything from anyone. But here, I felt like she was one of the weakest characters in the entire movie.<br /><br />3) Spock/Uhura. While I know this idea was kind of explored in the original series, it was portrayed by very small hints here and there which could be appreciated or ignored, however one's opinion leaned. In \\"Into Darkness,\\" however, it played such a huge part I felt like it was trying to take over the movie. Part of Spock's appeal is making us women feel like we want to be the one to break through his Vulcan exterior and make him feel, and it seems like Uhura is the logical (sorry for the pun) choice for such a role, being the consistent female presence on \\"Enterprise.\\" However, I just don't think the actor and actress have the right chemistry to pull it off, and their interactions not only wound up feeling painful and forced because of it, but it bogged down the storyline and made me want to facepalm and forever swear off romantic relationships forevermore in ST. (And this from a hard-core 'shipper in general.)<br /><br />4) The Klingons. Though they were made to seem a huge threat throughout the movie, we didn't really get all that much exploration with them. Aside from seeing them for one massive fight scene in the middle of the movie, they were mentioned a lot but stayed in the background. They've always been one of the most fascinating races in Trek canon, and here they just seemed - well, really, a joke, I'm sorry to say. Or a tool used to create an \\"ohmigosh are they suddenly going to come out of nowhere and go nuts?\\" that never really went anywhere...<br /><br />Things which could go either way:<br /><br />1) THE SCENE towards the end. This is a HUGE point of contention for moviegoers, I've noticed. My cousin is a purist in the extreme, and I heard him rant about this in ways that made me rethink my own views on the topic. On the flip side, my mother is also a purist (though not quite to the extreme of my cousin), and she seemed pretty okay with it. As for me, I'm on the fence. While I think it could be a brilliant ploy, reversing the original way it was told, I also think it might be the movie's biggest downfall. One thing I've been most excited about for the new \\"Trek\\" movies is their ability to take the old and make it fresh, because they have an entirely new timeline to explore. But taking a scene as well-known and iconic as the death scene in \\"Wrath of Kahn\\" and doing it - nearly verbatim - just in reverse... Well, I'm still not sure about it. So I'll have to put this in my either way column.<br /><br />2) Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn. I will be the first to admit I am NOT a BC fan. I can't stand him as Sherlock, and I've rabidly avoided most of his other work for that reason. I think he plays Sherlock almost as a villain (though we know Holmes is smart enough to commit a crime and never be caught, I'm pretty sure we're not actually, seriously supposed to suspect him), and I hate what he's done to one of my most beloved characters. For that reason alone, I thought he would be a very convincing Kahn. And he was ... to a certain extent. He certainly had the cold looks, the monotonous voice, and the stilted posture to carry off the role, but his sheer British-ness very nearly killed it. I know Ricardo, who played the original Kahn, was not from the same place as the fictional Kahn's origins, but at least he LOOKED the part. The fact he's a well-known and loved actor, I think, made them desperate to cast him just to get the fanbase into the theater. And while it seemed to work - and like I said, just going solely by his characterization, he made it work - I did not think he WAS Kahn. Not like the original. Is there another actor out there who could have looked, sounded, and felt the part? Perhaps, perhaps not. The original is a tough act to follow. But I'm certain there were others who could have done a better job than BC. So he landed in my \\"could go either way\\" column as well.<br /><br />3) Kirk's being brought back to life. Besides the fact there were plenty of other people whose blood could have been used to bring him back, I thought it was a bit cowardly to wait only twenty minutes before reviving him. If you're going to kill him, at least leave him dead and us wondering until the next movie. The reason why this ended up in my uncertain column is because, the more I think about it, the more I wonder if they're planning to follow this up in the future. After all, now Kirk has a part of Kahn in him. How could that possibly impact him, as a person, a captain, a hero, in the future? Maybe not even in a physical sense, but I certainly feel this has potential as emotional and psychological trauma which could play an interesting part in future films.<br /><br />Overall, I give the film 4.5 out of 5 stars. It was a very enjoyable film, and I do certainly look forward to seeing it again and again, and I will definitely purchase a copy of it. Thank you for reading my review, and I hope it helped some of you who felt a bit on the fence about whether or not to see it.

B005D6O1EW|5.0|I am a Croc lover, they are pretty much all I wear. These are super cute and extremely comfortable! I normally wear a size 9.5, but purchase a size 10 in Crocs since they do not make half sizes. I have always found the 10's stretch a bit after some wear, but this doesn't bother me. I hate my feet being constricted, and they don't fall off much (only if I am sitting with one leg not touching the floor, but even then they stay on pretty well!).<br /><br />I have owned these for about 6 months, and have worn them nearly daily. The quality is top-notch, something I have come to expect from this brand! And they are SO easy to clean if dirtied, just a simple water & soap scrub!<br /><br />I highly recommend these to anyone who is already a Croc lover, or is looking for a comfortable easy shoe!
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Can't wait for the next one!!  I hope Daniel does not change his attention to detail or his use of future technology as his writing style is unique!!
B0081336FO|5.0|Dont have TV because its stupid but this is great. Ive never heard of this Cumberpatch guy before but I like him. I hope he plays Doctor Who some day.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Khailed jumps from one place to another.  Most of the writing is uninterested events.  No flow or continuity.  I feel like I am reading some one's diary which is so boring.  This book is no where close to Khaled's previous writing. Reading Kite runner and Thousand splendid sun  was an experience.  I could not put those books down.  I wanted to know what will happen next.  Each and every page was a surprise.  I could not guess what was coming next which made it very interesting and worth my reading time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game<br />its just like subway surfer and temple run<br />but it has greater graphics, the minions are hilarious, and there are a bunch of other stuff<br />if your looking for a fun and free game I would suggest this one
B00004U8P9|5.0|Love this movie. From many years ago when we would dress up, throw water during the storm and throw rice at the wedding. What fun!!
B003XKDEX4|5.0|As with all Brilliant classic sets there is no better way to hear a vast library of musical creations of a composer. Of course we all have the best of Vivaldi on famous labels by famous performers....but the average classical music lover would seldom track down all of his works especially his more obscure works and pay $10-15 per CD. This boxed set which has fine sound quality and performances offers us the possibility of discovering works by Vivaldi that we would never consider at low risk. I was lucky and able to get a set at around $50. If you like Vivaldi and the great composers get all the Brilliant classic boxed sets. You may discover a composition of extraordinary beauty and then search for a better recording on a top notch label. To be honest a lot of the music is mediocre, but who cares at this price.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|This game is really addictive. I'm an avid candy crush player and I play this game as much if not more! My young girls love this game too.
143512975X|5.0|if you like sci fi or a story with a bit of an odd twist, this is it, you wont be sorry
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so addicting! You will love this game! Collect clues and problem solve! I hope they come out with more levels!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Love the bag, it's got plenty of room for all my accessories with room to spare for additional purchases of accessories.  It zips closed very securely...no flap cover to stretch and sag from the weight of the bag as with the camera bag that came with my camera.  And there is no camera name brand on the bag, i.e., Canon or Nikon, to draw the attention of thieves; it looks like a simple back pack...I like that.<br /><br />The only thing I am disappointed with is the method of shipment.  I paid the extra shipping charges instead of choosing free shipping just so I could get it sooner.  Only after it was shipped was I informed that it was being shipped via FedEx &#34;Smartpost&#34;...soooo, I had to wait an additional day for delivery by my local post office.  I have attempted with prior orders that were shipped this way, to go to the post office and pick up the package, only to be told &#34;we will deliver it to you tomorrow&#34;.  I know companies ship by this method as it is &#34;cost effective&#34; in their benefit but it forces me to wait an additional day...after I have paid decent money for shipping.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I really enjoyed this show. However, hope this is not how the country is really run.<br />I found the relationship between husband and wife to be similar to the Clintons.<br />Found it hard to get used to the main character speaking to &#34;us&#34;; although it was funny.<br />My husband was not as impressed as I was.
B003Y3AZSW|2.0|Cutting board set too small, reported size and what actually came is much smaller. It is not functional at this size.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|Shadowfever is a long book and it felt long with so many theory dead-ends, what-if's, and unfulfilled Mac/Barrons moments. Again Mac's grief in the initial chapters of this story brought me to tears, along with the chapter(s) where we learn the source of Barrons' sadness. Moning can write of heartache, regret, and despair like nobody's business. She can also write about love, hope, and courage. As much as I adored this series I have to admit I was ready for it to come to a close. I felt dizzy from the constant merry-go-round of clues that repeatedly resulted in dead-ends. I feel the reader is constantly being lead in opposite directions. Shadowfever could have ended so much sooner, but alas that would mean no more Mac and Barrons. After so many unfulfilled romantic moments, the latter part of this book makes up for it. Moning even gives the reader a bonus deleted Mac/Barrons scene at the end! So I gave Shadowfever 4 out of 5 stars because of the dizzy headache I got from reading it. However the series as a whole is 5 stars and is now one of my favorites!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very personal look at two men, one a USAAC officer, and one a Luftwaffe officer, in the most challenging time of their lives.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Ah Sophia Kinsella, how I adore her books!!! The Wedding Night was a light, heartwarming, and hilarious read. I wouldn't say I couldn't put it down but I will say that I didn't want to put it down. I should note that it wasn't all unicorns and rainbows though which is why I gave 4 stars (considered 3 stars) instead of 5. It took well over 100 pages for me to actually feel engaged in the story and I almost put it down due to a loss of interest but once it got rolling I loved it. There is dual narration that was initially very confusing and distracting, but once again it made sense when the story picked up speed. This story would make a great romantic comedy on the big screen or on broadway one day!(
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this app because you can practice being creative with makeup and clothing. Also, it is entertaining for a long while because you can choose thousands of different combinations. I recommend getting this app and buying the full version if you love it.
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|I found this book at the library and checked it out as a substitute for another title that was unavailable. I was planning to read it to fill the time gap until the other book came in. I thought sarcastically, oh wow, I should just watch the movie \\"13 going on 30\\" since it's probably going to be the same plot. I was pleasantly surprised and ended up loving this book. It's only my 2nd book in the chick-lit genre but I have really enjoyed reading Kinsella's books so far. This book had some really funny parts and was a fun read for an age-old amnesia love story.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Fun gem, good for wasting an hour or so waiting in an airport.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have it that they call it Chimpact, but drew a tail on the character! Chimps are Apes and do not have tails! Monkeys have tails.<br /><br />I know that is nit-picky and not relevant for most people. But, for some reason it bothers me.<br /><br />Overall the game ran alright on my Razor M. I have yet to try it on my first gen Kindle Fire.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Sadness, grief, friendship, torment, resolve, revenge, conflict, love, despair, hope, survival. Lots of emotions play out in this trilogy but no matter what changes occur with the story, it is themed with survival and the will to move on.
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|We are always searching for something to watch as a family. Jurassic Park is a good one entertaining without inappropriate content. The language has just a few places where I would have like to hit mute :-)
B0010SEMP0|4.0|My favorite part of this story was Cat and Bones' reunion. That was awesome :). I don't understand why Cat chose to stay in her current career versus work with Bones exclusively for the same cause. Oh well, I guess that just gives the story more characters to follow. This book was action packed! I liked the first book more but this one was really good too- the reader gets to learn more about the vampire world and their hierarchy/laws.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|This movie is in my top ten movie list of all time. Brilliantly written, masterfully acted, it is a classic. I watched it with my 18 year old son who had never seen it, and he was blown away. Highly Recomended. We watched it in HD, the quality was outstanding.
B000FCKBCU|3.0|This was a somewhat cute story. A little annoying to read about a female character being so ridiculously avoidant! However, I did really enjoy the scene when Sam and Nat string the peas and pick the raspberries!!!! Delicious!
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love the first season of this show. I'm hoping it continues. to be a great show and stay on TV for awhile and not just some over and out after a couple of seasons
B002HFJ77S|4.0|I really enjoyed this ghost story of sorts. It was funny and encouraging. The 1920's theme was pretty original and added to the fun!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Wow this game is great. great levels. Great everything. the fact that you can create anything is insane. If Chuck Norris had a game this would be his.
B003V1WST6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. For a chick-lit, it was pretty hard to put down. The characters were likable and the story was fun. It just happens that all the chick-lits i have read so far have been written by british authors about British characters. This is the same but most of the story takes place in New York so it was a neat surprise to be familiar with the environment. I want to check out some more titles from this author.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really makes you use your brain in a fun and creative way. Totally love this game,would recommend to anyone. A++
B005723JSQ|4.0|I really needed to read something light and happy and this did the trick. I love the plot and all the texting, very original storyline. I thought the ending could have occurred sooner and less dramatic but it was ok.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A very challenging game that I can't put down. I really love it. Recommend to anyone. Would be a great post time for a long trip.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|People who don't mind lots of interpersonal drama coupled with intense dysfunctional relationships might enjoy this story. I feel somewhat hypocritical because I have read paranormal books with similar elements that I have loved. I think since this is more of a contemporary story, I didn't enjoy reading these dynamics for leisure most likely because I see the consequences of this type of dysfunction at work everyday. I gave it two stars versus one because although I put it down numerous times with frustration I kept picking it back up and eventually finished the whole book. Something about it made me want to keep reading although I didn't care for the overall story. The characters seemed to have so much hope in each other, maybe that made me hopeful too? Regardless, I won't be continuing the series.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it have played it for about a year now.  this is one of the best ones I have played
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Wow, this series gets better and better. I enjoyed learning more about the characters' gifts and seeing the group mature and team up for a purpose greater than social status. I loved all the action in this book even though I was very saddened by the outcome. I could not put it down!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|GREAT GAME AND WAY TO ENTERTAIN YOU. Just Bananasssssss!!!!a minion wants to win the best minion of the year prize
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Honestly, I enjoyed about half of the book. It is very much a young readers book. I was rolling my eyes trying to remind myself that the writing is targeted for tweens/teens. The subject is about this group of half-angel teenagers who are \\"shadowhunters\\" that rid the world of demons. There was a lot of history and terminology to learn at once and I felt confused at times throughout the story trying to remember what people/places/things/events were. There were some action parts that had my glued to the story and I loved those parts. But there is a major twist at the end of the book that I absolutely hated! I'm conflicted about whether or not I will continue the series. I really did not like the twist at the end and that will affect the rest of the books.<br />Note: Although this is my particular view of the book, Goodreads has had it on my recommendations list for years and all the books have high reader ratings: 4+ out of 5 stars. So it's a hit with a lot people.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|The mouse is very responsive, the software works pretty well, I like and use the adjustable DPI and the 4-settings available by clicking the mouse button, and I'm mostly happy with it.  But it feels like it's built for a 10 year old's hands.  I like to put three fingers on the mouse--not a chance on this, so to roll the scroll wheel, or to click it or click the button above I have to take a finger off one of the main two buttons.  And the thumb buttons don't quite fit.  My hand is kinda scrunched when holding the mouse which makes it tough to use my thumb to stab the side buttons.  And I don't have big hands, just adult-sized hands.<br /><br />Good try, but for me it needs to be a different size and shape to be very good.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|I loved Zeus and Ben! I really liked Thibault and Nanna. Beth was ok. I pretty much despised Clayton. The story was ok overall. This was my first and probably last Nicholas Sparks' book. Not much into tearjerkers, not that there were many tears going on with this story but I hear that Sparks holds the world record or something...
B003U4UNUU|5.0|Wait!! there is an epilogue with Walt and HUGO and only available on DVD!! I am kind of annoyed that this if not on amazon or netflix where one can stream the show It only showed up when I wanted to read more about some of my questions. To help others out there google Lost.The New Man In Charge it is out there without buying the dvd. adds a nice coda to the end. it should be part of prime streaming i feel it is an important part to the story.
B000FC1AGG|3.0|This story had funny parts but the whole \\"secret\\" concept was annoying. I enjoyed the book up until the 2/3 point but the last third of the book was so ridiculous I forgot about the parts that I actually enjoyed. Oh and by the way, did Kinsella forget to write an ending? I think a little more story closure could have improved my overall memory of this book. Nevertheless, \\"it was ok\\".
B001AOKA3W|5.0|I loved this movie. It was very engaging and terrifying. I also think it was very well done given the challenge of filming from a point of view perspective. The only thing I am left wondering is why the monster stayed in Manhattan and have concluded that it was looking for the real Original Rayʻs Pizza and maybe a bathroom.
B009JZTOG8|3.0|I was a fanatic of the show during Season 1. Upon the first season's conclusion, however, I was baffled about how the show would find a way for its second season to be as compelling as the first after solving the core issue of the show within one season. It didn't find one. Nevertheless, there are some great episodes in Season 2.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This story makes me really stop and think of the plight of not only the Afghan people, but more so, the plight of women throughout not only Afghanistan, but the world. It is disturbing how women are treated like animals only because of their genitalia. Not unlike how black people are mistreated because of the color of their skin. My mind has never been able to comprehend this abhorrent thinking. This is a story that, hopefully, gives each of us a moment's pause to think of how we can, as individuals, make a conscious effort to treat all people with dignity and respect.
0060987464|5.0|I read this book when I was 15. At the time. I wasn't a big book reader and believe it or not, this book got me into reading more. There is just something amusing about books like these that draw you in. I never felt like I didn't understand or got bored with what I was reading(this has happened with many books for me.) but this is a great read. Take all you think you know about him and then see his side of the story.
0345404475|3.0|I've always known that the book and the movie were completely different.  Although I would disagree with many reviewers that the book and the movie are not as different as they've made them out to be.  There is some issue about the androids people are upset over.  Supposedly, in the movie, they are becoming more humanlike and readers of the book have a problem with that.  They should not.  At the time Bladerunner was made, Asimov's meme about robots was dominant.  In the movie, their sin is not adhering to the value of human life. No one denies they are humanlike nor that is a good thing.  The book however.  At least readers of the book, opine the opposite.  That the androids lack some basic quality (empathy) which makes them monsters and that their mimic of human life is somehow, so detestable that their very presence on earth must be a death sentence (even though the average lifespan of an android is a handful of years).  Curiously, the fact that ownership of androids by the majority of humans (who no longer live on earth) is near universal, is NOT dealt with.  The androids, tend to kill to escape, but once they do, they tend to mind their own business.  Constantly, the robots are showing signs of real emotion.  Far from being uncaring psychopaths, they show human motivation except the all pervasive will to survive.  There seems to be some plot by the corporation making them, to do this on purpose...but it's barely mentioned as a subtext and not developed. After carefully reading this story, I've come to the conclusion that the android thing is not what this book is about.  Whether or not androids are human, becoming human, monsters, or just malfunctioning toasters, is purposefully ignored in the book.<br /><br />What's going on here is, humanity is losing its marbles.  After a disastrous genocidal war, earth is a lost cost with few people around.  Those few people can't seem to hold a society together and have to go to extremes to maintain normal humanity.  Keeping a pet is a desperate sign of social status to show a caring for living things most only understand intellectually.  I don't think I saw a single example of someone actually caring for an animal in the book.  But APPEARING to care....that was everything.  Deckard and his wife go to such extremes simply to feel anything, that they own a device where emotions can be dialed up and programmed.  These are all elements of a people losing their humanity.  And don't even get me started about the religion.<br /><br />This book gets three stars because it's famous.  It deserves two stars.  The idea for the story is great...but vague.  But the real problem here is the story and writing are terrible.  They are trite.  That is HARSH criticism for something that is supposedly a hallmark work of science fiction (for which I call fraud).  This book could have delved deeply into the human condition through a clever vehicle.  Well, it has the vehicle but doesn't really go anywhere interesting with it.  That's the problem.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I sat and played the game in a single weekend, much to my family's chagrin.  The visuals are amazing &amp; game is fantastic.  If you enjoy Riven like games you will enjoy this.
B00003CXRM|1.0|I'm disappointed. I tried 3 different players and the disc won't play. I don't have a printer so I can't print out a label.
1451627297|5.0|Stephen King's imagination is stunning beyond belief. It's the best way to describe this man's mastery over research, and weaving together a story so complex and detailed that it would throw you in a time warp (pun intended).<br /><br />The book is about time travel. But saying just that is like saying Earth is a planet made up of air, water and carbon compounds, period. It's only when you start going into the complexities of the subject matter (in this case book or Earth...whatever) do you realize how intricately woven the real story is.<br /><br />11/22/63 was spectacular and the ending was JUST what could most appropriately complete and finish this epic. In between pages 400-550 I felt that maybe Stephen King had dragged the whole Texas time frame and the school life a bit too much. But that's just my personal, humble opinion. I feel the book could have cut some fat and could have been a bit more fast paced.....maybe there is an opportunity for an abridged version, who knows. But at the end of the day what matters is that this book is a contemporary CLASSIC, undoubtedly.<br /><br />Read this...and you will be blown away and would be begging for an HBO mini-series and might just have tears in your eyes to see how it all folds, unfolds and refolds and then unfolds. This book will tie you in a knot and might turn you into a crying man...or a woman.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Disappointing. This makes my kindle hd hang on the \\"loading\\" screen. I have to shut down to get out of it. Too bad because the intro looks great.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This is not Ender's Game Part 2 so don't expect the same type of story.  As Card explains in his forward, this is the book he wanted to write, but he had to write Ender's Game first in order to adequately create Ender. This is a great story and a fast read, however, make sure you slow down and think about what Card is saying about humanity.  As long as you are not hoping for space battles you'll enjoy this book.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|This is a great movie to popcorn and curl up on the couch with your kid or grand kids with.  A Christmas favorite at our house.
B008PZZUTS|5.0|Anything with DeNiro I love.  Well performed by all the actors.  The ending had already occurred to me.  Got a feeling when he found what he was looking for and packed it away.  The you guy's face was hilarious as he realized what DeNiro was saying to him.  Absolutely loved it.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I felt the head squashing was a little too easy. I guess what makes you a zombie also makes your head soft. Other than that the story line was good.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book. Was a quick read and I especially liked the author's story-telling capabilities. I am interested in organizational processes, and this book discusses a number of the pitfalls and bad habits formed by individuals as well as groups. A good read for managers looking to change behavior of their team.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|OK - one complaint - Amazon took their sweet time allowing this onto Prime viewing ... I mean its the BBC ... the equivalent of PBS here - that is if you don't take into consideration that instead of volunteer patronage of PBS in the UK any household that is using a color television must pay a TV fee of ~ $220 USD annually...  TV taxes are pretty standard in the EU overall.<br /><br />But back to this series - possibly the best written, acted and filmed series I have seen yet on a time of huge change in England - post WW I - post WW II
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is totally addicting!  You must constantly be on your guard.<br />You sit down to play for a few minutes and end up playing for three hours!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Hard to describe and  impossible to classify novel yet I loved the point of view and other worldly settings that Mr. Gaiman delivers once more in a well constructed, fast paced novel for all ages.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Good fun and also a way to work the mind.  Enjoyed playing the game and glad there is a shuffle mode.
B002JXK5VU|2.0|Out of the box this product leaked at the hose connection.  I had to replace the washer with a better one.  I also had to wrap extra teflon around the hose connector.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|New Jack and the Bean Stock. Jack and the Giant Slayer was a pretty good movie. Maybe a sequel will come out in future.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I recently read this book in a quick three days.  I found the book interesting if not a little captivating look in the dynamics of a marriage which is anything but typical.  The author has created a well-written book which immediately captures the reader.  As a result you find yourself loving and hating separate characters throughout the book until the horrifying truth becomes apparent.  A great summer read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game!! Keeps you very busy! And it is very addictive!! This a great game to play if you have time to pass away!!
0307949486|5.0|I was very much surprised by this book. The plot twists make this a must read for anyone that enjoys complex characters and just good writing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Entertaining and fun. Makes you use your imagination. I can spend a lot of time with this game. I really recommend this game.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The first time I've read a book with this style of writing, I enjoyed it immensely.  The book put new aspects of a zombie invasion, that I had not thought about.  It also explained the logistics of fighting a zombie invasion that made the book an interesting read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I started this game, I just started tapping on things randomly because there are no lists or clues to start you off,  but once you get the first item open you u understand in a flash what your next steps are.  I love object  search games &amp; this is different, definitely worth your time.
B004LROMX4|4.0|In the begining the story roll little slow and most tired talking. After the second bluray disc , the history start to turn over more dynamic, at the end of the season. I just already order season 2.<br /><br />My only complaint is the sound is regular, not what expected.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If you are looking for a great game look no further. I got hooked on this and could not put it down!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wait til you try it. You will not be able to stop playing!!!! We had 2 Kindled and we kept going finding more information and clues.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so funny. I'm 11 and it is a great book. It's funny as I said but then u can't stop reading it. I enjoy these books and I can't wait for another book to come out
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Large, clear numerals.  Easy to figure out how to use the different areas to create fractions.  A beautiful, well thought-out calculator.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think minion rush can be fun for all ages and I love the fact that it is based on despicable me! And this app is much like subway surfers or temple run! I would recommend this app to all children and all different ages.
B007EC27QM|5.0|An excellent calculator with all the necessary functions you might need.  Also, would be great for your kids to use to check their calculations after finishing their homework.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The app is really fun but the tropical is hard especially during the victor battles  and there are pipes that lead you outside I don't like the out side level it is impossible to get out of  other than that it's really fun
0062238868|3.0|I think Kyle was at times too humble.  If you are looking for a book with details of the Navy Seals training, there are better books out there.  If you are looking for details on his kills and mission, it is lacking (maybe intentionally so).  The book is a lot about his family, his thoughts, etc... and it is not that interesting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you don't have minecraft than you have to get it<br /><br />Ut wacht out for creepers  B<br />  I loooooooooooove minecraft.Its soooooo fun
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|This game could easily be 5 stars, it has amazing, realistic pre-rendered 3D graphics and fun game play.<br /><br />However, TWO MAJOR FLAWS are holding this game back.<br /><br />1. When you touch and drag the trampoline AND if you accidentally drag your finger over the HOME or BACK soft keys, then those keys will register and cause you to go back to the home screen to back to the previous screen.  The developer needs to do an \\"on touch and drag enabled\\" event and disable the HOME and BACK keys.  Then, do an \\"on touch and drag disabled\\" event to re-enable the HOME and BACK keys.<br /><br />2. Please make an HD version.  The current version looks very blocky on high resolution tablets like the 1080p Asus Transformer Infinity.  I can imagine this will only be worse when Asus releases the 4k resolution of the Transformer in the fall.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Wonderful like the original movie the book was better then the movie dorthy was nice to give  a kiss you ROCK
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I loved the earlier games but this one is far better. They kept the Zen quality but the puzzles are even more fun to solve.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|5 Stars<br />I like this American dictionary because it has a lot of word's in it that can help people find what word they want to find<br /><br />I here Alex Ramirez has decreased this dictionary to my royal brother Alexander Ramirez
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great fun and really makes you think about about strategies to get out. So much more than your basic escape game - cannot wait for future levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a very fun game it addicts gets your thinking and really fun especially if you've Seen any of the movie!!!!!!!! Fun for all ages
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I tried several times to download Kindle for Android ontp my Samsung Galaxy Tablet.  The &#34;tablet&#34; says it is on my tablet, but I can find no record of it. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but, as I say, I'm receiving the message that Kindle has loaded, but I can find no evidence of it. What a waste of time!!!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|It's A Very Good App And I Recommend It To Others If You Like Games That Have A Twist And A Challenge To It.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|A psychologist friend of mine read this book while on vacation.  I read it the day after she told me about it.  Well written, easy read.....emotional.  I haven't loved a book this much in a long long time.  Thanks Lisa.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun! A must download of you like fast paced fun games. I cant stop playing it. This fun for all ages.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Many of the exercises I had read and said 'Oh Yea' but had never taken the time to do.  This time I did them and you can to, I won't share the results but I was not disappointed.  Enjoy, I did.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|-- I would not be repetitive of the good comments... the album is a great fusion of blues-seasoned good ol' rock & roll, with pieces of funk, which gives it such sexy appeal... can't wait to see him on tour with John Corabi... What a bill!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Play is smooth.  The biggest hitch I found was discovering that one had to touch the lower margin of the game screen to bring up the game's start menu.  The ads - one at the start of every hand - are a big enough annoyance that I just could not give this game the fifth star.  Great for keeping myself occupied at the doctor's office while I wait for my wife to get done.
B00BURWSHA|5.0|-- ever wondered how Aldrich would play if not under Coverdale's british blues' influence?<br />... ever wondered why Whitesnake made such an awesome comeback from 90s oblivion?<br />... ever wondered who's responsible for such an incredible full guitar sound?<br />... pick this album for answers... and please, of course, enjoy!
B009IF82SK|5.0|The shows just keep getting better and better. The characters have all taken on a life of their own. I love this show.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Fast and smashing, this one is a hoot! Two parts - buy low, sell high; and drive with no regard for human life!
B008NW1M4K|4.0|Adolf Hitler awakes in a vacant lot in Berlin, more than 60 years following the fall of the Third Reich; he muses at the 'dry cleaner' smell of his uniform,  is appalled by the informality of verbal communication between strangers, and tackles the lack of social order and leadership.  It's fiction, and possibly fact, but is it funny?  The author uses an interesting combination of writing styles.  His characters' dialogue and vocabulary is modern, informal, slangy and most often humorous, whereas the prose all too often features long, complex sentences with multiple multiple phrases that will tax the readers interpretative skills.  This subtle juxtaposition of modern and antiquated writing is, in itself, a clever metaphor for the subject - a social dinosaur in a post-evolutionary world. For many readers, the book tells a lighthearted story that features funny vignettes; the book also exposes aspects of modern society that will move a sensitive reader.<br />Er ist wieder da: Der Roman (German Edition) is a must-read for readers with adequate German language skills; those waiting for the English language version may have an equally rich experience, but it will live or die on the skills of the translator.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like it.  I find it kind of confusing.  I don't fully understand it.  All I know that it can be an expensive game because you have to keep adding money in order to play it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it it is very addicting I cant seem to stop playing very great game. my mom cant stop playing either
B007REV4T8|1.0|I see this movie cost $150 million.  A shame really.  If they'd spent another 50 bucks on the script they would probably have gotten a much better film.
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|The new album is phenomenal! I want to absorb every note into the cells of my being. When I listen to the new songs, I never want to stop - it truly is that good. Bravo to the awesome and talented members of Sigur Ros! I don't think I have ever appreciated a band this much. Their music is beautiful, full of emotion, and creates audio landscapes that take you to another dimension. Did I already say it is phenomenal? If you like their music, buy this album right now! If you haven't heard them before, buy it and give it a listen. You won't be disappointed.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have read a number of David Baldacci's books and they have all be a good read.  This one was especially good -- the character development is excellent and pace of the story is fast enough to hold your interest and keep you guessing until the very end.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|The National has been one of my all time favorite bands since the first time I heard them. The new album meets and exceeds any expectations that I might have had. It is a landscape of perfection for my ears. Buy this album if you like exceptional alternative rock, talented muscians, and a vocalist that is swoonworthy (love love love Matt Berninger's voice) Cheers to this band!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I really like the game; however, I found it bothersome that when I downloaded the free version that nothing was said that I could only enjoy the first level.  This should be made clear in the description.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This is an absolute cracker and I would recommend it to anyone! I have aleatory recommended it to few colleagues and friends.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I tried the free version and enjoyed the first level (which is all that you receive in the free version).<br />I find the game addictive and very entertaining.  As the levels advance, it is also far more challenging--which is terrific.
B00DUCXFUC|1.0|It's got the exact same discs you already own, plus a short featurette and an additional documentary of undetermined length (probably short and filled with previously seen interview footage and padded out with lots of clips of the movies), a couple of hot wheels cars and what is no doubt a slim book. The packaging isn't even very special. You'll watch the featurette and doc once, you MIGHT flip through the book once. Are you going to play with the cars?<br /><br />This just doesn't seem like an upgrade, just something else to spend money on.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I found it amazing that I can have the entire Bible on my phone.  Any time during the day that I need words of encouragement, patience or strength--it is right at my finger tips.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My toddler LOVES this game! It teaches him problem solving to avoid being caught, and improves his dexterity.<br /><br />What's even funnier is when he gives it to me to play, I die MUCH earlier than him!
193700788X|4.0|No Spoilers here, - well Ok just one. - but this was a good finish to a long run.  Almost everyone and everything is tied up in this ending, we have some new characters that seem to NOT be harboring some stupid or emo grudge against some family event 200- years ago, a LOT of good people doing what they believe in, a clear limit to the crazies, the end of a long long grudge, and, again, a good wrap up leaving Sookie alive happy and with the promise of staying that way (that there is the spoiler).<br />...<br />Now - as for the legions of whining crying pouting little girls who just live for blood and guts and precise grammar and Cinderella-fantasy - no ladies (and lady boys .. not a smear on gay men but on the whiny crying pouting little girls mentioned above who are men .. or what passes for them), - this is not your book.  Go read the twilight series if you want sturm and drang, read Bram Stoker if you want \\"Authenticity\\" or go read Ann Coulter if you want stupid.  This is not your book.  Stop reading it, Stop reviewing it, Stop writing about it.<br />....<br />For the rest of you, especially those that love the series - Buy this.  You will like it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Totally awesome and well worth the money. Best puzzle game I have played in a long time. Can't wait for# 2
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Read it after seeing the movie but still wasn't disappointed by either version. Good book and I would recommend to anyone!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|you have to keep trying and keep upgrading but part of the fun.  its a good challenge.  definely give it some time to get your car good enough for the challenges
B006S53QCK|1.0|To slow getting started, I tried getting in to it. Just had trouble keeping me interested. Had some good actors in it, but failed from the start.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Frustrating when you've tried something that later ends up being it, like the paper on 10, but still fun to  play.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|\\"The Guilt Trip, amidst much of the mixed reviews given to it and James L. Brooks-like similarities in writing, is surprisingly one of the best and most earnest comedies/dramas seen in a while.<br /><br />In the modern tale of a mother-son relationship, Seth Rogen and Barbara Streisand go on a journey all the way through New Jersey to California in a Chevrolet Aveo as a means to satisfy Rogen character's promotional escapades to sell an organic liquid cleanser and to develop a stronger bond. What makes the film stand out is much of the film's treatment of the subject matter with moments involving them dealing with the usual quarrels and quibs that a loving mother would feel for his son (talking about their love lives, parenting, or recommending that he would drink water or lessen his alcohol intake).<br /><br />It is equally at parts heartfelt where we see notable but never overtly sentimental moments of Andy and Joyce, the two characters' names, dealing with their lives, sense of isolation from friends, loved ones, and past acquaintances. It is quirky and follows a Hollywood model in my places with the occasional PG-13 sex jokes and stereotypes but the film does not take the usual comedy route these days where \\"that and that only\\" is the prime focus (think other movies that Rogen's done before like Pineapple Express).<br /><br />Nothing stellar in terms of a social message, cinematography, or design but the acting and storyline all stand out to create a believable story that many can relate to and watch, laugh, and probably cry. For all reasons unknown, it might have been the Marty, the 1950s Ernest Borgnine film about an unmarried New York butcher, of December 2012.\\"
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this book in one week. I really enjoyed the story line of seeing Auggie from other characters' perspectives. The quotes that went with each character's section was interesting. The book gave me a good idea about the daily struggles of a person like Auggie. I will definitely be more mindful of the first moments in meeting a person like Auggie.
B008JFUORW|3.0|\\"To much disdain and lack of appreciation for this franchise, The Hangover Part III takes a little detour from the repeated craziness of the sequel (which to the surprise of those reading this review, I have not seen yet) for a wild goose-chase in Tijuana and back to Las Vegas. The film is notable to a certain degree for its divergence from the overtly comic formula to something more thriller-oriented and darkly humourous in content.<br /><br />Much of the film focuses on Alan's problems building up when a giraffe's head gets decapitated, his father who passed away, and Mr. Chow, who returns again, to con the Wolf Pack and steal their money and goods. The film stands out slightly with its action-thriller type of plotline and its insistence on being moreover something that is bizarre and hilarious yet tense at the same time. John Goodman makes a surprise appearance here as a frustrated gangster and his presence here shines with irony and seriousness. The film's budget has been amped a bit to give a more cinematic edge to it with the action set pieces and locale.<br /><br />Even with its pluses, nothing is really spectacular about this film other than Alan falling off a rope made of bed sheets and stuck between E and S of Caesar's Palace, Mr. Chow running away from a Thai prison, Melissa McCarthy appearing as a cameo and hinting something suggestively with a salivated lollipop, and Mr. Chow sniffing a spiked cocktail. The film, surprisingly, is more brutal and violent than its sex-heavy predecessors and especially for people not used to dark comedy or comic animal cruelty, Part III will especially be troubling.<br /><br />Aside from that, if you are already caught up by now, Part III would probably be a better choice because of the differences that exist even if you have or have not seen Part II. In the end, the finale was worthy and was not too bad. It made me laugh and made me believe its zaniness toward the end but nothing more though.\\"
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We had seeing  this in  the theater and enjoyed it again at home.  Fun for adults and kids. Good viewing!
0151003084|5.0|I got this book for my son he love's it. And it brings me back to my childhood reading this with my dad!  I highly recommend this spooky book!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|this game is lots of fun and enjoyment.  wish that we got more credits every day.  I like the features and the power ups.  they help get more points.
B00BJ7G1VK|5.0|This books has so many great recipes in it. check it out  you won't be sorry. I really enjoy it
1881273377|4.0|A must for all couples!  Helps you know each other better and how you can express your love as well as receive it.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This is without a doubt the best movie about life in the mafia that I have seen. Probably Scorsese's best film as well. It's about the real life of mobster Henry Hill. This film is full of unforgettable scenes and dialogue. Masterful film making from Scorsese. An amazing story  about life in the italian mafia and an incredible movie!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Hard to put down, keeps the reader engaged from the very beginning. Not quite sure how I feel about the ending, felt rushed and not fully developed like the rest of the plot.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So fun! The horses are so pretty and it's fun to take care of them. Also this review has to be 20 words minimum and I really just want my 3 free gems to be honest.....
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot.  Not just a sappy romance novel, but one with distinct characters, and even a bit of action and suspense.  Very good read.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|I love this movie. I wish the second one was done as well as this movie. I know some may think low budget but I felt it was great. I watch it every chance I get.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great for checking the weather at home and where our family members live in other states really easy to use and interactive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy this app a lot. It is a great time consumer . My sister and I enjoy taking care of the horses. You should download it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great read; the author is both philosophical and descriptive action writer.  Both male and female readers should love this book.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Rivaling for the spot of my favorite movie ever. I still get that feeling I did when I first saw it even 15 times in.
B008602KQI|4.0|Find interesting the drama and the similarity of the time that we are living rigth now. Cool ending facing the home return
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is the first app I have downloaded like this.  Keep the rooms coming!<br />Some of the rooms took me awhile to work out but it was fun to have to think about it.  I would love to see a beach theme room or a New York high rise.  Some rooms with Windows and other doors.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I haven't had the time to get really into this game yet.  It is something different, so I was hoping it will<br />enterain the grandkids, they always want to mess with my animals when I don't have the time, so i'm hoping<br />this will help.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Diamond Dash is addictive. I hate the fact that you have to wait so long for only one Life. It's torture, glad I have my Facebook friends<br />To count on.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|For kindle this is great but the internet holds you back from playing anywhere if there isn't internet , say in a doc office or  a hospital treatment room ( I get renegade treatment ) you can't play.
B00B769XB8|5.0|Hansel and Gretal was quite different to the original story. Although very violent, I did quite enjoy watching it. Thank You.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|The cat is funny at first but you have to buy other stuff because all it will do is replete and purr  it makes me want to punch it and I'm a animal lover...
B00866JL96|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie after hearing how good it was and I've loved most Nicholas Sparks books/movies. I was very disappointed with this; I was bored out of my mind watching it - a hot guy does not a good movie make. It was very slow-paced, as someone else said, and there's no natural chemistry between them. The chemistry between the two leads doesn't feel natural and feels forced to me - there were no \\"sparks\\" there at all.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I love all of the bird games but sometimes I'm some where waiting and can't play because of the internet thing  I play on my kindle.
0385523394|1.0|This proves that a liberal arts area of study does not Broaden the student as an adult, it simply makes them a whiny drag on society.<br /><br />A later addition to my review:<br />Still think it is correct.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It is an amazing all for ages 10 and over, you can communicate with other people and send messages, videos, and photos.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing sol. You have the chance to beat the game. Without thinking you prepare to beat the invisible player.
B002ZG98FU|4.0|really love this movie but what I didn't like is wide screen I really did want it in full screen other than that it arrive when expected and in great condition for used
B002XWXPC8|5.0|This movie is a hands-down classic. So many young actors and &#34;classic&#34; feel. You don't have to be in Indians fan to enjoy this movie and you don't find many movies about baseball that translate to film this well... Must see movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Could use more levels. Really easy to play. Maybe more secret items to find and a story line to make it more interesting.
B003ZA0BCY|4.0|This is a really good movie if you're into the older and more light hearted movies. The acting isn't so good but the plot and the way it was written works well for this type of movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that the game is cute and funny for all ages and you should get the game graphics are crystal clear.:)
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|My review focuses on the service and not the movie itself as I realize the product is related to your internet connection and computer configuration.  Ordering the movie is easy and the stream is consistent so you don't get a &#34;choppy movie&#34; or one that consistent has to download &#34;parts&#34; intermittently for the whole movie to play.  The only downside is that the rental was for 3 days and while it turned out to be a good thing I would have preferred the option of renting or more days.  Again, minor issue but something to think about;.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love the game and you should play it makes the travel time quick and easy and it also fun!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Having seen the movie in the theater and again rented the dvd I had some friends over and we decided to watch the movie again.  Unfortunately the HD version does not download to PC although my flat panel would play HD.  The stream was fine, the movie played smoothly but I have to tell you that it was better in HD.  I might be stating the obvious but to me there was a noticeable difference.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Social media application that is easy to use, same as using a laptop or iPhone. Great app; would recommend to other Amazon users
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Only bought the package because Raiders wasn't available by itself and never really cared for Temple of Doom.  But still a good deal at the right price.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|Does not allow enough time to enjoy playing. The game is very similar to Bejeweled and Witch Saga. Not a game i would want to continue playing
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I really like the concept of this show! Not sure how realistic it actually could be but definitely entertaining. Overall very entertaining and there's quite a few pieces of male eye candy along the way ;-)
B004WOS3P4|5.0|The more that I listen to this album, the more I like it. The sound (instrumental performances + production) is really something special. I love the bass playing for one thing - you can actually hear it, and it compliments the melodies in interesting ways. This Loud Morning does have a bit more dimensionality to it than David's self-titled album, which all in all is a good thing. It still rocks plenty hard, especially during the choruses, but there is more nuance as well. A very nice batch of songs here. And of course, the central quality being...David Cook's voice. I am not sure how to describe it. Rich, powerful, passionate. I still go back to what someone said in a review of the previous album, that David's voice is \\"like hot bourbon poured over honey.\\" I assume that that's a good thing - in any case, this is a very good album. I do have to say that the cover art seems rather disappointingly generic, but other than that, I find this record more than satisfying.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|the sigma force novels blend a little religion, history and suspense.  the characters are exciting.  every storyline is exciting to the very end.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is the most addictive game ever. It's really fun and never gets old. There are tons of stages and vehicles and upgrades. I plan to be playing for quite a long time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Each new person, each story line keeps you wanting to know more. Looking forward to the next book. Hope it just as good.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe is a great combination of sci-fi, drama and comedy couched in the bizarre. Very creatively done. Love the cast!
B00C1GBOU6|1.0|I really don't like it at all.  In the reviews it said that they were like Dead<br />Can Dance and, frankly, they are very much not like Dead Can Dance.<br /><br />If I had a chance I's sell it or return it for credit.<br /><br />Thank you very much.<br /><br />Yours very truly,<br /><br />Angelique Zayas
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I heard this band for the first time on GMA and found their music interesting. I downloaded the album and it is a nice different sound than I have found recently. Easy to have on in the back ground.
B000HL2J0G|1.0|Okay with the show itself, but I got burned by some of the show being cut off towards the end. And it was part of the video it wasn't a glitch. That kinda made me sour on the series because I really don't want to sit through a show that long only to not see how it ends.
0545157617|5.0|It is a touching story about a father who was lost, and who finally found his way home to be reunited with his family. My 3 year old daughter cried when I read this story to her, but was consoled when Stick Man finally came back home just in time for Christmas. Beautiful illustrations by Axel Scheffler.
B009DT98RK|5.0|Great concert,nice packaging.The sound & picture quality are first class.Would have loved the sound to be 7.1 DTS HD.<br />Otherwise terrific
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Best book I've read this year.  So original, gripping, funny, adventurous, generous, engaging.  Made me want to know more.  bravo.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|There are not enough levels,  my son wants to play more.  pretty good other wise. thanks a lot.<br />good concept
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We can't wait until Season 4 comes. I just wish that did not kill off William in such a predictable way.
B005HIBWFW|4.0|I don't like all the movies of Ken Russell, but when he was good it is quiet a joy. Maybe The Music Lovers is his best film : music fantastic, all full of color , a kind of old Russia reinvented, a plash of pure enjoyment. And if the acting of Glenda Jackson is great, as always, the team of real lovers, Richard Chamberlain and Christopher Gable are really amazing. They don't men as beautiful as them anymore. Really a joy to see those two guys at me. It's great and that's all.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|A must read for anybody in IT Operations , whether he is leading it or part of the team.  The initial chapters will make you at home as it presents the typical challenges faced by IT and the impression rest of the company has on IT.<br /><br />This book will give you lot of insights. One that struck me was drastic similarity on IT with manufacturing.<br /><br />Love the presentation in which the concepts are introduced.
B000GBEWHA|4.0|Maybe this one is not a great film, even a great musical, but the young john travolta is the great asset, so is a great john travolta film. And the years will pass and he is was still beautiful, but saturday night fever and grease are the epitomes of the 20th century male beauty at his best. thanks for masculine beauty, thanks for allow us of still seeing the walk of the great travolta. God bless him.
B0052GACNM|4.0|The music is great. Played it in the car for a week. When I play it in my cd jukebox it won't play the first song not sure why?
B00AYLTMMM|2.0|Hellen Hunt is definitely capable of more. This role was a bit too shallow for her. It felt like the plot did not give her a chance to unfold the full character. The rest was actually fine.
0525953728|5.0|This book is worth the purchase price.  Very interesting story of our special operations troops and the hunt for Ben Laden.
B00062PN6I|3.0|Disappointed however I guess that's what I get for $20.<br /><br />I have a small head and couldn't tighten them up enough to get the earpads to seat.  I might be able to fiddle with it and get it to fit.  I only tried once, put them up for later..<br />End
B00BLCHL4Y|4.0|I have really enjoyed watching this program!  The engaging characters, unique story line, and quality acting more than make up for the few faux pas in historical accuracy.  Looking forward to season 2!
B00DMF8PCK|4.0|This is a great movie for your entire family.  Its a classic that any kid will love, it gets their imagination going. The special effects are just awesome for being a movie from the mid 80's.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|Well, there are things to like and things to dislike about this odd film.  The film is a nice blend of comedy and horror; however the horror might be better described as dark humor. Tim Burton is a visual genius and his films are eye stunners. Based on the old television soap opera, Dark Shadows has visual effects that would be the envy of those involved in the television version back in 1968. Interestingly, Depp is not sexy in this film. He is stiff and creepy but he never emits sexual vibes. His make-up, including the greasy black hair that encircles his white face, is just creepy, never sexy.<br />The character of Angelique, the white witch seeking revenge for being rejected by Barnabas Collins 250 years ago. When Barnabas is finally released from his tomb after 200 years of entrapment, Angelique continues her revenge against the Collins family. In the final fight between Angelique and the Collins family, I actually found the wood-work carving and architectural details coming to life as a visual treat. Eva Green actually out-acts the rest of the cast in this film.<br /><br />Whereas the visuals are entertaining, the plot is a bit weak and is not really related that much to the original television series that I watched as a kid. When it was time for Dark Shadows, we would jump out of the pool and watch with dripping swim suits. I don't think this much enthusiasm is evident in this new interpretation.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|They should have kept this to one movie only.  They are trying to drag out the story to much with multiple movies.  The actors do a wonderful job and are the only redeeming part of the film.  I have read the books several times through and I've seen the movies for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy more times than I can count.  This will disappoint, Read the book or watch the cartoon instead.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I was excited to see the price of the book down to $2.99. Unfortunately I felt that was overpriced.  Tina is a good writer and I chuckled in a few places but other than that I found the book to br an unorganized series of name dropping quips that only served to prove she knows famous people.  I have had the book s month and have yet to finish it.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The movie would have been excellent if it had been just a little shorter.  I did like the acting and all of the action scenes.
B000Q04XDY|4.0|Mr. Spencer is the new for most author in America on this religion, it's culture, and it's ideology.  The more you read on this subject the more you learn and understand the treat against us.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This book, after the first chapter, starts off very slow - then gets so addicting that... well, I don't have anything clever to say.  It just gets very good and hard to put down... then it hits a lull... and then gets great again... and then the ending is pretty damn disappointing.  Overall, I enjoyed it a lot and found the plot to be very interesting and the characters equally as interesting.  I could deal with the slow parts, but that ending sure did bring the whole book down.  Still, it was really good, overall.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and everything about it.  The characters, the setting, and the time.  The actors are amazing and I cannot wait for season 4!
B008Y768XO|3.0|Was a good family movie.  Slow in parts very sad after the owner died. Might be too sad for younger kids.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I believe this was the first game I ordered.  I love playing mahjong and look forward to buying more versions.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Good action and a solid story line with a different twist. Of course with a love story attached and a very good ending.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I like Mr.  Grisham's books.  He does great research and presents it in a informative way.  Great job, Mr. Grisham.
B00136NUG6|5.0|I love Earth Wind and Fire so I can't help but love this greatest hits compilation. Anyone who appreciates their music will love this.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|It&#34;s as if they never went away ! Ozzie sounds great ! I was able to notice Tony Iommi's riffs right away.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched this whole thing in 2 days - it's sooo good! I loved watching it marathon style, it was such a treat!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent, suspenseful.  Reviews briefly what happened and the relationships fro<br />m book one.  Cliffhanger ending.  Does not disappoint.  I can't wait for book three.  I also can't decide who I want katniss to end up with in the end... Gale or Peeta?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter started this game. Now I play it and I'm on level 41! We don't buy acorns, but win them sometimes playing scrats game. I play it everyday.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|A great story about a man's struggle with life events.  Mirrors religious stories and myths in a creative way. Could not put it down once I started.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST MAHJONG GAME OF ALL THE GAMES THAT I'VE PLAYED SO FAR. THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING  THE TILES ARE AMAZING BUT MOST OF ALL THE BACKGROUNDS ARE SO PEACEFULLY MADE. THE SELECTIONS OF THE SHAPES ARE NUMEROUS...JUST THE BEST...THANK YOU AMAZON
B008J05EL8|1.0|Does not open after installed. Total waste of money and can not be returned for a refund. Very disappointed in Amazon for allowing this defective product to be sold.
B002GYS1FO|5.0|When I discovered this CD, I immediately bought copies for my three kids in their 20s (and early 30s, sorry Kiddo).  They loved it and were impressed...for awhile.  The group has a wide range of songs.  &#34;How Do You Like Me Now&#34; is strong.  Really strong.  You want to keep driving with it pounding in your ears.  But, my favorite is &#34;Short Change Hero.&#34;  I played them both  obsessively for a month.  &#34;Short Change Hero&#34; starts off like some sort of Western &#34;High Noon&#34; tune then they deepen it, give it soul.  The deep rich hum takes the song into the core of your body.  It is a song track for the Borderlands II video game.  There is a lot of basic blues oriented rock on this album and its all to the good.  And then there is Reggae!  And its a great tune, too. Its all good.  Buy this album.  Bet you'll buy the rest of their albums as well.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|Saoirse is wonderful in this movie!!! And her accent, beautiful! Great idea for the story too! If you haven't seen it, it's a must see
B00BIR381W|5.0|This set of discs was in excellent condition and played perfectly. I would buy from here again and recommend this purchase to anyone.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I think this movie is a great idea. It raises awareness for young teenage girls. It's sad that women trafficking still exist so every parent that has teenage girls should have them see this movie if they are traveling overseas (there is mafia everywhere though, from different countries) the same way they talk to them about kidnappers here in the sates. Great work! I have watched it several times and Taken 1 is better than Taken 2 in my opinion.
0152023984|5.0|It's a great book with lots of life experience you can pull from it, but its also written in such a style that any child can read it and enjoy it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this app is great and that if you love the minons you'll love the app so you sud get it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this app is fantastic. This is great because some children cant have real life horses so a virtual one is amazing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a nice game, especially for girls how really like horses, like me. I like animals and taking care of them, I enjoy spending time with these beautiful creatures.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Five stars . The book is an awesome and amazing.<br />I say that this was a good and funny book
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|Wonderful movie for the whole family! One of Pixar's BEST! Great message and great characters! This is a must-have for the kids.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was very happy when it came to Amazon Prime. Just like when I indulge in chocolate , I was going to pace myself and only watch one or two at a time .Of course I watched them all within about 2 days! I am greatly anticipating season 4.
0545091020|5.0|I bought this for my dad, as he loves a good story, but he is in his 70s now and his eyes don't let him read for as long as he would like to. Over the years I have always shared books with him that I love, and now I buy him the best ones as audio books. I love The Hunger Games series, and now I think he will too. He's really enjoyed listening to the first one, in fact, he's been flying through it. I highly recommend it, for those who can't or don't want to just sit down and read the book for whatever reason, or for those who enjoy having a story told to them.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the wide variety of topics available.  I can find anything I want to follow here.  The recipes are wonderful.  I could spend all day browsing.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|This movie puts you Inside A U-Boat through times of incredible success through a transition when the Allies had turned the tide.  Very realistic and filled with irony time and time again.  The best submarine movie ever produced...be prepared for a journey that may leave you breathless.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game!I can play it for hours! Great for kids and adults the same, hope they add more levels.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I loved The Walking Dead tv series! Couldn't resist getting it to watch whenever I wanted! I bought this while it was on sale on here and was very pleased with the price as well as the shipping.
B007H7XJD4|3.0|Lots of action and great special effects. If you liked the movie 300 then you will like Immortals. Not the greatest story line I've seen but not the worst.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Video streaming kept frezzing, Had to re-start movie several times.<br />Wish I could say problem was on my end, but wife was also on line.<br />Movie OK.
B000HZD168|4.0|This film is a very fun space romp with some moments of considerable depth.  Shatner and Montalban make for terrific adversaries and the entire cast brings their best game to this one.  It's the one Star Trek I would recommend to anyone who has never seen one of the films.  Credit producer Harve Bennett for coming up with the idea to have the film continue the Space Seed story and Nicholas Meyer for his lively script and direction.  It's the tightest budgeted Trek ever yet seen by many as the best proving that creativity goes a lot further than money.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|OK, I wasn't sure about this series at first.  Getting to know the characters in the first season was a bit odd. Olivia seemed to get everything she wanted without question and everthing she never seemed to get anything wrong.  Walter seemed very weird.  Peter was kind of stiff.  Lots of the shows were about gross stuff too.  I don't like gross stuff.  But it was interesting and I'm glad I stuck it out, because by the 2nd season I was totally hooked.  Things get real interesting in the 2nd season.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game takes a little getting used to as it is a very twitchy fame.  It is definitely repeatable and the whole family can enjoy the merry madcap hijinx of the minion.
B003XZ4F78|5.0|Great movie for 7.5 and 5 year old boys.  Wish they sold the three in this series as a set.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I was engaged for the entire reading. If you are a fan of video games you will enjoy it even more.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|I gave this to my son-in-law for Father's Day.  He is a baseball enthusiast and actually never saw Moneyball!  Whether you are a baseball enthusiast or not, it is a great movie.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|It is a movie. It is great. It is animated. See it and feel your life complete. A a a a a a a a a
B009KS4XRO|3.0|When I play this on my desktop there are no problems. Playing on my Kindle Fire is a different story though. It freezes during games constantly. You lose bingos. You lose coins. And you lose XP. Sometimes it just closes for no reason. Therefore you can't get anywhere. I will only play as a guest on my kindle now so as not to lose credits on my facebook account. As a guest you rarely bingo and can't finish collections. I have been playing on the kindle for a year now and have not finished one collection as you can't get the free ones you get when connected to facebook from friends. I only gave it 3 stars because it works on the desktop so well. If I had to rate it for the kindle only it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|As a teacher, I approach any film based on great literature with my class in mind. Can I use this film to better their understanding? Can I use it to generate conversation? Can we have a good talk about interpretation after watching it? Is it worth watching? Will my classes of teenagers enjoy it? For these questions the answer is all the same, yes. This film is made to be accessible to those who have read the book; it is more challenging to get through if you have not. This film is made to appeal to a visual generation, and it is full of imagery and symbolism. Every scene can be paused to discuss - why -choices have been made. And a love story without the stereotypical development, well, that is a welcome conversation indeed. The film and the book are fast companions. Show the film first, then read the book - the class will be hooked. This film is beautiful, is it the novel come alive? No, it is an interpretation and that is what makes such an excellent choice for discussion. Teachers, if you teach this novel, or have entertained the idea of teaching this novel, do the kids a favour and get this dvd.
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|Because of the fact the movie is still fairly new and at least half of the world hasn't seen it, I'll keep this review sparse.<br /><br />When \\"Despicable Me\\" came out in 2010, I didn't see it as a film that could generate a good sequel (although making $540 million at the box office pretty much made it a certainty). If this had been released by Disney instead of Universal, odds were this would have ended up like one of those straight-to-DVD types that were so common in the 1990s and early 2000s. But this sequel is one of the rare movies that tops the original in terms of plot, pacing and even music (if you're a fan of 70s R&B and disco, you're in for a treat), so it's more than deserving of its own shot at the big screen.<br /><br />Positive No. 1: You don't even have to have seen the original to follow what's going on here. This was great, because my family and I didn't remember much about the first one (which says something in itself).<br /><br />No. 2: The pacing is well-done. There's not really a slow moment; the movie chugs along from second to fifth gear admirably throughout.<br /><br />No. 3: The script is solid. Sure, there's a few plot cliches, but you get past them because you spend a good chunk of the movie laughing hysterically. I have to admit that part of the ending was different than I expected, which makes the film all the more great.<br /><br />No. 4: The film is loaded with subtle and not-so-subtle verbal, visual and written references -- whether it's \\"I Love Lucy,\\" \\"The Man With the Golden Gun,\\" \\"The Spy Who Loved Me,\\" \\"Footloose,\\" or others -- to where you feel like you need to see it again to look for more. Lucy's Southern California cell phone number, by the way, is a real working number, not one of those 555-1212 items.<br /><br />No. 5: Gru's yellow \\"minions\\" put the film over the top in terms of humor. Try watching the scene where several of them are doing a version of Boyz II Men's \\"I Swear\\" without spitting popcorn out across the theater.My wife tells me that part of what they're saying throughout the film is in French. Given the highly French production team, I wouldn't doubt it...although maybe it's backwards French. And they do all of this without being overly crude (families with young kids can rest easy). No wonder they're getting their own movie in Christmas 2014.<br /><br />My only negative: Don't bother with the 3D version -- there's really not that much here, animation-wise, to merit spending the extra $4 or $5 per ticket. Don't get me wrong -- the animation is solid (although we appear to have maxed out after \\"Toy Story 3\\" in terms of what can be done on screen). But aside from one scene, you can watch the basic 2D version and not feel like you're missing anything. And you'll avoid the eyestrain-induced headache.<br /><br />All in all, an \\"A\\" grade. Sorry, Superman, Lone Ranger, Hangover 3 guys and Will Smith -- here's the real summer blockbuster.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|Not sure why this App is working so great for everyone else, but it surely is not for me. First, I tried to pull up a You Tube video, which it finally did, but the audio was terrible, it kept crackling and going off and on. Then I tried to pull up one of my own videos on my computer, and it just locked up my Kindle Fire. Oh, well..........enjoy everyone, I'm deleting. AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FA DAT!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|good read, but all the action parts are pretty similar.. leaves you knowing what's going to happen before it really happens
B009NQZVKG|2.0|Like all series there comes a point when things have run their course.  This is that point for the Sigma series.  When you have to spend countless words filling in what happened in prior books.  When you have to grasp for a plot that tops the others.  One more book for a series epilogue and then Mr. Rollins should return to the stand-alone novels which were so much better than this.  Or at least start a new series with new characters.  Maybe with less of the end of the world plots.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khaled Hosseini is one heck of a story teller.<br /><br />I loved the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns is easily one of my favorite novels. As for 'And the Mountains Echoed', I did enjoy it - no doubt. But it was missing the magic that I found in his other novels. His previous novels had me completely hooked -  the characters, the drama, the stories, the  left me totally mesmerized.<br /><br />Make no mistake this book was wonderful too. But like a few others have pointed out, the narrative was a bit disjointed, at times the plot seemed rushed, characters came and left abruptly -  so I didn't really get a chance to connect emotionally with most.<br /><br />Highly recommended, despite it all.<br /><br />Eagerly waiting for the next novel, for I think his best is yet to come!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Although it took a little time for me to get into the book, once I was, I could not put it down. So beautifully written, the reader is a part of Alice, feeling her feelings and experiencing her events. What a beautiful way to go through the stages and demonstrate her decline and the true realization that those that suffer with the disease still remain a person even after their mind is diminished.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love how the main character talks to the reader. You hate and love him at the same time. Great job.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am in the process of completing my first book and preparing it for kindle publication. Building Your Book for Kindle helped significantly. I especially appreciate the common mistakes section as I would normally expect MS Word documents to automatically transition. This is not the case and this book walks us through the steps to fix formatting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Such a great mix adorable and a challenge. I don't think you can get any better that this. It's so much fun.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I don't like this game at all. No directions and it is not clear as to what you need to do.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's a great app but the map feature needs a better way to update the<br /><br /> radar. Otherwise I love it, especially the hourly forecast.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I enjoy this very easy to use and there are a lot of puzzles to download for free! I'm. addicted
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I have ALS and this book was recommended to me by a physician.  The writing style was easy to read and the author was very honest about himself and his relationship with Morrie in telling his story.  The inspiration gained from reading about Morrie will help me in my future endeavors.  I would recommend this book to everyone even if they don't have ALS.
B0091REZMW|3.0|it is somewhat repetitious and only allows advancement to a certain level before you run out of energy and must buy some to continue.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Love this album.  Every song has something about it that sticks with me.  I find the last song I listened to rattling around in my head for hours after I've stopped listening.  This album has become the go to album for my teenagers and my 50 year old wife.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|In her book Pam Grout succeeds to make attainable the invisible by doing experiments that prove that we can change our reality and that we can shape our life with our mind (our thoughts), That spiritual (the opposite of material) principles are dependable and consistent. She relies on science, not on religion, to do this. Her style of writing is whimsical, light and so easy to read. Although I read on this subject over and over again, she's the only one who has managed to get rid of my skepticism. Her advice is simple and so easy to follow and phrases like \\"when the puppy misbehaves, take him outside until he learns.&#34 makes it possible to monitor and get rid of negative thoughts. She made me laugh, making of a serious subject a lighthearted thing. Even if you don't want to do the experiments, it's worth reading. As for me it's a book I'll read over and over just for the fun of it.<br /><br />AWSOME book! Bravo Pam.<br /><br />note: wish this book was translated for all my French speaking friends.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I could see the formula from the first chapter.  Did not like the way the historic facts were presented.  I quit reading the book after about 100 pages.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I watch this movie all year round! It's a feel-good romantic comedy guaranteed to make you fall in love with Jude Law! hehe :)
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Like many others I had intended to boycott this movie based on the fact that Cruise was cast as Reacher...which, pun intended, I thought was quite a reach.  But I was pleasantly surprised that Cruise pulled it off quite well.  I felt he captured the essence of Reacher although, having read all the Reacher books, I would have enjoyed more watching an actor the same size as the book character.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! It came within the next few days and plays perfectly.Thank you so much, you guys!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game. Time just seems to disappear. Great when having to wait at any type of appointments. This game takes your mind off of the wait.
B003NHRIUW|5.0|I'm a die-hard Nicholas Sparks fan. Books and movies! I really don't like Miley Cyrus but this is the only role I truly enjoy her in. And the story is absolutely amazing. Phenomenal!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Perfect games for solitaire lovers who want a bit of excitement. The daily courses add an extra bit of fun.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|I caught a preview of her next release and decided to check out previous recordings. I completely fell in love with this collection and played the tracks back-to-back for the next two days. Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very good thinking game and can be very hard at sometimes because things are in the most obvious places and good to do with friends.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|If you've seen season 1, you already know how great this show is. If you haven't seen season 1, watch that before you start 2.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved the twist and turns of this story, it is the only thing that kept me reading this book. It was very clever, but no one could like these characters, even if they were related. They are sick and deserve each other.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is not ky kind of game.  I usually go for brain/puzzle games, but my 5 year old nephew thougnt it looked awesome, so I downloaded the free version and I emjoyed it so much that I payed the extra $5 to unlock the full game.  5his is why it got 4 stare...because FREE should be FREE.  Needless to say, there is brain puzzles (monaco) and evevn the usual hidden objects section is pretty great!
B000FC146C|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book and I loved it more the second time. The author took time to develop her characters and let them tell their story. We loved some of the people and wondered about the others. I learned a lot about the geography of the country, but the love story is the page turner.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is really fun! it is a good time waster and it is a good game for all ages!
B00821OX98|5.0|Sci-Fi at its best.  Caution: it is addicting.  You watch -you will be hooked.  But it is so worth it.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game is very addicting!!!  Lots of fun for all ages and all the graphics are top notch!  Find I have to play it every Nite
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love to play this game, does not require to buy gold or gems to keep advancing through the levels. My daughter and I enjoy playing the game as we both love horses.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I loved this movie. Scared me senseless in a way that made me want to go out and buy it. Excellent .
B008K6HN8I|2.0|For what I needed it for it did not work it is not to say it's a bad app I am going to keep it for now.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love the creativity and challenging levels .....just what i was looking for ....worked super in my Kindle fire ...thanks ...hope to see more games from fireproof in the near future...( :
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|If I could I'd give this game 100 out of 10! This game is great for children ages 6+!<br /><br />Even though I love this game I just can't seem to get past the last level!Ugh but I still LOVE this game!I'm trying SO hard ugh! :D
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Look it's not going to win an academy award but its somewhat entertaining.  Good message but its not that funny.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Wow scribbleauts is one big hit in the app store I just love the game so much even when I rage at it :). I just have a request of being able to spawn celebrities and movie creatures like the Blob but otherwise I love a lot EVERYONE should have this app!!!!!:D
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I enjoyed this a great deal. The movie moved quickly, the acting was good, and the storyline was super. Jamie Fox and crew all did a super job on this one. I recommend!
B001NIA27E|5.0|Hands down one of the best movies I've seen. I was only 2 when this movie came out & was later introduced to me by my parents years down the road. This is a movie I think anyone can really appreciate. For being 1996, the visual effects are AMAZING. The acting is great, Pierce and Linda are exceptional actors. You'd think that the supporting roles and extras would be horrible, but not even! The movie's intensity and destruction are the best part. It's an easy movie to get into and definitely makes you feel every emotion- do yourself a favor and see it if you haven't already!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|My wife and I both loved this one. The story line was very interesting and the acting is great. Recommend it highly!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This book will change how you view IT. It left me excited about the possibilities. Excited to get started on something where I could put to work some of the things I learned from this book. Highly recommended.
0385535147|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and read it over 2 days.  It was a lot of fun and it should make a great movie.  I think that anyone would enjoy this.  It was not predictable and I think that it was definitely worth the time and effort to read it.  Go for it guys. . . My pleasure
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's really cool! Great graphics, same lovable characters, better power-ups than most games in this category. It's like Temple Run and Subway Surfers, put together and better. Overall an EPIC game. Get it. Get it now.
B002ZG9846|4.0|the comics is superior. Yet don't be fooled this movie is pretty awesome. its just if you get a chance to read the comic you should.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|a fun flick for the whole fam.i have to add 13 more words to this review to finish it up.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I'm not a show type person when I saw suits then I've realized it's the most significant show of all to watch when there's nothing left to do.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I think there should be more games that you can get 3 stars without buying helps. some of the games are very hard to get one star with without heps
B007HACDLK|4.0|Had to go back over it several times to keep track of all the characters but story line was plausible and interesting and I really enjoyed the book.
B006T5C5PS|1.0|way to weird and not something to try at home as a non-medical person. don't buy this book it won't heip
B002HWBS96|5.0|The Rosenkavallier:<br />The singers are outstanding. Good version  which was a good addition ty my person alcollection. A very  Good purchase
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This book feels like Patricia Cornwell has finally gotten back on the right track! Thank goodness! I thought we had lost Kay Scarpetta and all her family (and friends) forever. I hope Ms. Cornwell continues writing like this so I can stay up nights reading instead of sleeping like I should!!! Good book!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I am having trouble navigating through the new format. There is too much clutter and there don't seem to be any instructions.
B0081BU42O|4.0|Enjoyed the story!  Banks has a wonderful imagination.  Did have a spot of bother midway through, where I lost track of the plot, but I did get it sorted after a bit.  Just love those cheeky ships!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|This not only is a great show, but what really makes it is the incredible music! Can't wait to buy the next CD!
1442355476|5.0|good suspenseful book.  It was close to all the Tom Clancy books.<br />Had a surprise type ending...Won't give you the spoiler alert :)
B00005LMBK|5.0|This album is great, the grooves are very powerful and will move you. Take with certain materials and you're night will be fantastic.
B001E75QH0|5.0|great old school movies.  It is a classic. I loved it because<br />my kids with different ages can all view and have a great<br />movie night
B008QLXSG8|5.0|This book is awesome.  Camus' mastery of absurdism is unparalleled.  Also recommend to anyone interested in Jungian archetypes, the stranger being the most difficult to understand.
0061726834|4.0|So I started this book after seeing on Darren's instagram that he was filming for the movie. I didn't really know what to expect but I ended up really liking this series. It was a new concept with great character development.<br /><br />The story starts with really showing how society works in the story. The whole premise of the story is that love is a disease that must be removed once each teen turns 18 in order to prevent before they become infected. The society makes sure that prior to the procedure schools are segregated into male and female groups. Children are taught very early on to shy away from any behavior of affection even with your only family.<br /><br />When the book starts Lena is very much a good girl trying to fit in with society. She is worried about where she will be placed based on her exam (exams determine your husband, job, how many children you will have and many other important areas of your life)<br /><br />During her interview portion of her exam the building is broken into which interrupts her interview. Lena at this point is relieved because she feels like she was doing poorly. And now this is where the story gets really interesting because we meet Alex!! Who I fell in love with almost immediately.<br /><br />Although I will say there is another love interest I don't want to give anything away! I would really recommend reading this series as the characters were likable and really grew throughout the story. The story also had a new concept to it which is always nice as sometimes I feel like I keep reading the same story over and over again.<br /><br />News<br /><br />As some of you may know this book has been picked up by 20th Century Fox for a TV Movie to be released sometime in 2014. Two of the main characters will be played by Emma Roberts and Darren Kagasoff (Ricky from secret life!). Movie information from IMDB.<br /><br />For more Reviews [...]
0062014536|3.0|I was really looking forward to this book.  Lauren Oliver pulled me in with Delirium and I had no doubt that I would be finishing the series.  So, it's always a risk when my expectations are high.  Plus, this is the final book in the trilogy.  You want everything to wrap in such that way that you are satisfied.  I'm not really sure this book delivered all of that!<br /><br />Lena has come a long way from the love sick girl we met in Delirium.  It's not longer about getting out from under the cure.  Lena sees the bigger picture.  She wants to act, to do all she can to bring down the very people she use to think were protecting her.  Problem is she can't do it alone.  She needs others to help.  And more than just her little group of resisters.  The world isn't going to change for just them.  But, Lena never gives up until she finds what she's looking for, both in love and in life.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was mad out our little surprise from book two for most of this one.  I think he acted like a royal jacka$$.  I know he endured a lot and escaped, and the whole time was thinking of Lena.  But, did he really except to her to be waiting and pining away for him.  I think she went through the despair long enough and I know I was happy for her when it seemed she moved on.<br /><br />This final books feels so vastly different from the initial book that I feel in love with.  I know our characters have grown in leaps and bounds.  But, I feel like they've become hard.  I miss that carelessness and excitement that they had in the beginning.  Plus, I was really disappointed in the ending.  I feel like questions weren't really addressed.  I kept thinking this can't be it, yet everything I've read says this is the final book in the trilogy.  While, I sometimes hate it when an author makes a trilogy longer.  This time around, I would like another story.  This one isn't done!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This movie is even better than I rember it! I Love all 80's movies! This is a must see again and again!
0316077046|4.0|I was a little worried when I cracked open this one.  It's been quite a few years since I read the first one.  The details were extremely fuzzy, and I have to be honest that they never really came back to me.  But, I read on and really enjoyed the story.<br /><br />I think what threw me for a loop was that Lena is definitely not that same character that I remembered.  Lena has always seemed intense, but managed to make the best of her situation.  Plus, she had a deep connection with Ethan.  All that seems lost in the beginning of this book.  I understood part of it because her uncle Macon died during her claiming ceremony.  But,  I thought she took to much blame upon herself.  She was trying so hard to convince herself that she was evil.  Before hurting anybody else she loves, including Ethan, she begins to follow Ridley and a mysterious newcomer.  They promise her peace and land rumored to exist.  But, what will the cost be to get there.<br /><br />Ethan is the rock in this book, a character trait and perhaps a flaw as well.  I'm truly glad that he never gave up on Lena.  Even though we eventually learn there is a reason for his connection to Lena, he knew that her actions were not a reflections of who she really was.  All he needed to do was to lead her the right way.  It was making her see that the choices she made the night of her claiming did not make her evil.  He will follow her through to the end, even defying those who claim the world she lives in is to much for her.<br /><br />I love how we learn more about the Caster world in this book.  I don't remember the first one giving away this much detail, from the keepers role to the tunnels.  It's much more involved than I thought.  I loved the introduction of Liv to the story.  It gave it the slight indication of a love triangle, even though I knew that there really was no one else for Ethan but Lena.  And as always, I loved Link and Ridley.  I'm looking forward to the next one.  Perhaps it won't take me as long to read it.g to read it.

B009IQ0TGM|5.0|This album is awesome, I liked every song on it. Some of my favorites weren't even the ones that they plan on the radio.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I just hope he's not going o become too predictable.  This book was definitely more predictable than the others.... Or maybe I am just learning not to get attached to characters.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love this series and for some reason when it was on Sunday evenings, I couldn't get into it.  I was just seeing bits and pieces and I just didn't get it.  But now that it is on Amazon and I can start at the beginning and follow the story line through, I am loving it!!<br />The characters are so good and true to life.  Cut throats, slime balls and criminals, this series has them all.  You get to see the good and the bad side by side and you get a more complete understanding of just how the law, politics and justice work.  I'm a huge fan now.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|The set is fantastic and great value for money. I have only seen three of the movies before and they are great. I was surprised how slow and boring \\"star trek the motion picture\\" was, but  they got better at it after that. I think they were trying to blow our minds with the new cinemographic techniques and giving us too long to absorb what is now rather ordinary. But the stories are great, especially love \\"The Journey Home\\"
B000L212HC|5.0|We have not opened this dvd yet; but always wanted to own this movie.  We saw it a few years ago at the theater and really loved it.
B004SRNH10|1.0|Runs hot in the background of the Android upon boot and made my phone heat up to a near melting point.  Now I had to buy a new phone one month before contract was up- costing me over $300 for this free app!
B000I3W1XS|5.0|I've enjoyed Star Trek since it came out on TV in the 60's & have seen all the movies at least once, most more than once.  Capt Kirk and Spock are my 2 favorite stars.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The double plot line of aristocracy and servants is mesmerizing.  The characters are all well developed.<br />But . . . it's so sad we lost Matthew!!
B00D0QSZHG|5.0|I love this book and I recomend it to my friends and family. Because most of my family members prefer to read in Spanish, I got it in Spanish as well. I prefer it in English and its very well written. I own many books in this topic and some books are great and others are not, but this one is one of the great ones.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a fun game but has some times where it's slow. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fun game!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Its great to find a book that has a different story line than usual.<br />This has it. Always keep me engaged .
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The ending was not apparent until very close to the end.  Enjoyed the detail and progression of suspense thru the chapters.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I am a big fan of Tolkien and this DVD is a great addition to my syfi and fantasy film library.  I will watch it many times and see something different every time I watch it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This really is more than just porn. There's a story. An emotional roller coaster. It's really very good. I can't wait to read the Christians point of view version.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love watching this.  I cannot wait for next season to continue the journey.  I especially liked being able to buy it and download and watch immediately
B0071XO8RA|5.0|While structured as a series of novellas, the novellas piece together to give a coherent view of a dystopic world in which it is the suppression of information that keeps the populace oppressed. A dark, well-written story in a thoughtfully imagined and terrifying future reminds us of some of the liberties we take for granted today.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This book was a good easy read.  The characters were interesting. The plot could be expanded or more complex.  Good book for young adults.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|It is great to see yet another Arnold film. I enjoyed watching his career and now as a sheriff with some out of town bad guys, well, you will get plenty of explosions and just good old action.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Most &#34;free&#34; games are pretty lame unless you actually want to spend money for upgrades.  This one is fun and not that way.  Just wish I had more time to play it.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like Awkward at first, but by the end of the Pilot I was hooked.<br /><br />This series is for more mature audiences and not for teens, I believe due to the language and sexual content.<br /><br />Other than that, you will enjoy Jenna and her life in high school.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|Nice romantic escapism and humor with some kindness and heart and ethics mixed in. Anne Hathaway does a great great peformance.
0143120255|4.0|I live in New York City, but I haven't been to Paris.  I am guilty of drinking large Americanos though.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I saw the movie first. The beginning of this book is confusing and slow, but after about the first 75 pages, it really grips you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging, the graphics are also great. Keeps you interested, unlike some of the other apps similar to this game.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie is a pure joy to watch from beginning to end. Okay, maybe more so for women. But it also addresses the serious issues of how African American maids were treated by white families they worked with...and it shows a big range of how they were treated. They were always the help... but some families treated them like human beings and some truly did not.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Although the ring picks someone based on what it sees inside them, it was not apparent that its choice was really the wisest.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is such a great app!! I love this app when I'm bored&infin;&infin; a d that's a lot &infin;&infin;&infin;&infin;&lt;3&lt;3 &lt;3
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The author, being a well known and respected neoursurgeon gives a great perspective of the potential life after death experience. Regardless of your belief in this area I found it to be very well written and sheds some light of a diffrerent color on his experience. As a patient in the hospital his death and loss of all brain activity is well documented. The book expands on the details from not only himself but his attending physicians as well as his family. His descrptions of the next life are unique from all other books I have read on the subject. Well worth reading!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter's absolutely love love love horses. They have a lot of fun playing with this app. Sometimes I play with it too...lol
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I dreaded watching this because the previews made it sound absolutely stupid.  Surprisingly it is actually very well done.  It looks at a series of couples going through the pregnancy process -- one who accidentally gets pregnant, one who tries forever to get pregnant, one who adopts (virtual pregnant) and one who aborts.  The gem is when the men go on their daddy time.  Great stuff there.
B00821OX98|5.0|I never seen the show before, I started to watch and then my son started to watch it as well.  Looking forward to season 3!!!!!!!
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|This is a story that is not that creative and not that interesting.<br /><br />It's a book that attempts to trick you into thinking that it is presenting something profound - that if you `just don't get it, you're just not smart, creative, or interesting enough'.<br /><br />At best, just average story writing.<br /><br />If you have not read it and are in the mood for an adult fairytale, pick up \\"The 13 Clocks\\" by James Thurber...a far more interesting and better written book.
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|My son is only able to use 1 arm after surgery for a brain tumor and this app gives him something to do. He was up to level 84 and I purchased credits to purchase in game stuff. Then this morning it did something and reset. No refund nothing. Does it again I will just delete. Using on Kindle Fire HD. VERY DISAPOINTED!!!!!!!
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|I love this game! Who knew that a card game with so few cards could be so fun? 16 cards? That is crazy! I don't know how they came up with this, but it works and it works well.<br />Only complaint is that it only plays 4. It plays well with 2, but it is rough being a constant target.<br />I really like this game, 5 stars.
B00COMLLX2|4.0|This is a great game but it gets frustrating when the stupid tilt comes on<br />Otherwise this is a great game
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can read books sitting in front of my Doctor's room:-) However, difficult to keep track of pages on a mobile phone.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game! My 10 yr old, 2 of my friends and I love playing this game. It's great to play in tournament mode too, we have a blast competing. A+++!
B003O86FMW|3.0|It was entertaining, but did not have the same excitement as the original book. I enjoyed the characters and the pace of the book.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Only thing I did not like about this book was the ending. For it being the final book, I wish it would have tied up more of the loose ends. There are cliff hangers all over the place. It does leave it open for more books to be written. I will keep my fingers crossed that happened.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. Very entertaining. Love the fact that you get more than one room sometimes. Will share with friends
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have been doing as this book says. It was been working for me. I recommand this book to anyone and everyone.
0061998885|5.0|Things haven't been going well for Patrick Kenzie, so when Karen Nichols hires him to get a stalker off her back, he doesn't give it his best effort. Then when Karen commits suicide he's consumed by guilt. With Angie and Bubba with him on the case, Patrick learns that there was more than a stalker in Karen's life and now all three of them are in danger.<br /><br />This book is best read after the others in the series, but it is a stand alone novel. And like his other books, Lehane takes us on a ride to the dark side of human behavior, but he's such an excellent story teller that we're there before we know it happened. There is a lot violence here and it seems all too real, so real it's scary. Lehane paints his people with the brush of truth, his descriptions with the brush of fact. A five star book if ever there was one.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good game. I like all the strategies in this game. I would like to play more levels!!<br />Let's hope all levels are just as challenging
0307474275|5.0|Museum curator Jacques Sauni&egrave;re is running for his life. In the Grand Gallery of the Louvre he rips a painting from the wall, an alarm goes off, bars clang down, sealing him in and away from his attacker, an albino named Silas, but the attacker shoots him through the bars, wounding him. Silas is after a centuries old secret and he offers to spare Sauni&egrave;re if he talks, Sauni&egrave;re lies, but the lie is a good one and the Albino believes him, then leaves him to die with a belly wound.<br /><br />Jacques is desperate to pass his secret on, but only to his granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, a cryptographer with the DCPJ (Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire) the Judicial Police, the French equivalent of the FBI. So he uses his remaining few minutes to strip naked, then he draws a circle around himself with an ultraviolet pen and positions himself like DaVinci's most famous drawing, \\"The Vitruvian Man,\\" knowing Sophie will see his body and figure out his first of many clues.<br /><br />The Judicial Police summon Robert Langdon, a Harvard Professor of Religious Symbology, who is lecturing in Paris, to interpret the crime scene, but unknown to Langdon, they suspect him as he was supposed to meet with Sauni&egrave;re later that evening. Sophie gets Langdon away from the cops and thus begins a book long scavenger hunt, chase scene that you'll be telling your friends about for months to come.<br /><br />I'm sitting here at my iBook trying to think of how best to describe Dan Brown's writing. It's fast, sure. Historically accurate, yes. Descriptive, without a doubt. But none of that really gets across what I'm trying to say. Maybe I can make a comparison, Dan Brown writes like a cross between a young Robert Ludlum on speed and a young Frederick Forsyth on steroids. There is a reason why this book is the worldwide, number one bestseller, and if you haven't read it yet, you should.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is an awesome game! Ever since I got the game, I have been playing it over and over again!!!!!!!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is not only fun it's addictive I sit there just playing bag it for hours when I first got the game it was the lite version so I didn't have all the levels and I have just been eating to get it.
0307352153|5.0|I have long wanted to read this book. The title and premise intrigued me more than I can tell and I wanted to know what the author had to say. She didn't disappoint.<br /><br />The world that we live in is loud, noisy, pushy and arrogant. The quiet, humble and meek get pushed to the side in favor of the brash, arrogant and bold. The author makes the case that the world would be less developed, interesting and complete if there weren't introverts in it. I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />One of the strongest arguments that the author makes is around the concept of group think, that scary tendency to go along with the crowd whether they are wrong or right. The frightening part about this is the new science that shows how our brain changes in group settings. Essentially, if I'm understanding it right, the new research is showing changes in how we process things based on what those around us are saying. In short, if the group is saying one thing, our brain changes in order to agree with what is being told to us. Practically, how does this play out? It played out in a huge way in the melt down of the financial markets where everyone went along with the over sized and ignored warning signs. Practically, in our own lives it manifests itself in any group where there seems to be a forming consensus. The scary part is that those group decisions are often led by extroverts.<br /><br />Cain does a brilliant job arguing for why introverts are necessary, how they can be helpful and why they should be valued, not ignored. This book is amazing for any introverts wanting to feel legitimized, for any extroverts who don't understand why everyone isn't like them and for anybody wanting to understand better how to interact with the quiet, bookish people in their lives. A definite must read!
0753541637|4.0|Sandberg combines personal experience and research findings to discuss how women perceive themselves and are perceived by others and how these perceptions influence both a woman's choices and the options open to her.  She offers  suggestions for dealing with both.  The book is directed toward women who want to &#34;lead&#34; [you could say, climb the ladder to the top] but could be helpful for anyone, man or woman, who wants or has management responsibilities at any level.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've tried other battery meters.  They tell you how much charge is on your battery.  Meh.  This one tells you  how much time you have left if you're watching streaming video.  Or if you're just playing games.  Or if you're checking e-mail.  And it's easy to see at a glance what you have left.  I like it!
B0050R0YB8|5.0|Ok, so it doesn't look like much from the outside and seems a lot simpler than many of the other sets I've put together over the years (Taj Mahal, Eiffel Tower, the whole modular building series, plus a couple of other UCS sets like B-wing and X-wing) but the sheer size of it and the ingenuity behind the structural integrity of this beast make it a total pleasure to assemble. Yes, the price tag is daunting, but if you buy it and build it I do not think you'll regret the money spent--unless of course you're planning to actually play with it, in which case it is lacking, but as a model it is phenomenal.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a technically a legal thriller and a very good one, at that. But far more, it is a human drama with surprising depth.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Okay so this review has spoilers in it<br /><br />This book touched my heart at the end. Katniss had to go through so much pain, torment, sadness, and the loss of Prim, Finnick, Boggs, Cinna, and she had to let go of Gale. But the one she could always count on was Peeta. In the end she had two kids that didn't have to go through hell like she did. The rebellion won but was led by the wrong person with the wrong mind. I cried at the last two chapters, maybe you will to.<br /><br />This book was great. Some people just don't have enough sense to understand the meaning that Suzanne Collins was trying to make. If you don't like the book then maybe you don't have enough sense to make the connection between the first two books and the last. Katniss went through hell in the first two books so while trying to defeat Snow she lost her sister, her friends. She went through complete torment in TWO YEARS of course she went a little broken. She had a perfectly good reason to! If you lost all your family and friends you would be just as broken as her. So understand the concept before you judge the book.
B00136JR2M|5.0|These were awesome songs when it came out back in the day and is still awesome today.  I am glad I got these songs in my collection. I forgot how much I really liked this album.
B005MW5CWW|5.0|...and made another solid album.<br /><br />If you love Mastodon's heavy, chugging sound and progressive writing style, this album does NOT disappoint. From the time signature changes to the melodies both on vocals and the guitars, The Hunter is another sonic landscape from the hard to the sublime. As only Mastodon can do.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game.  Some easy...some make you think.  Had some problem getting used to the movement arrow in the left bottom...playing on a tablet and am right-hand so it was not easy to remember to go left..  But other than that was very good.

1609611543|5.0|I was starting to accept my lower energy and body aches & pains as a natural consequence of aging.  I started to scale back on sugar/wheat consumption prior to reading the book, and I was noticing positive changes.  As I read the book, it documented what I was actually experiencing, but I became more shocked at what wheat could do to the human body.  I am now +98% off Wheat-gluten products.<br />I am saved!  I am free!  I am back in control of my body and mind!<br />Here is what I experienced after eliminating Wheat-Gluten:<br />- Sleeping soundly, waking up READY to go<br />- Dark circles under eyes gone &#60;&#60; a surprising result!<br />- Running/cycling faster and stronger<br />- Energy levels way up<br />- Excess body fat gone; clothes loosening way up<br />- Allergies gone<br />- Joint aches/pains gone<br />- Mood better; clearer thinking; no brain fog<br />- No need for between-meal snacks; late night snacking GONE<br />- No more bloating after meals<br />- No more craving for sweets, candy, sugar<br />- No more craving for Wheat-based products!

B001RHOJSE|5.0|This is a report by Hannah Arendt, a philosopher who wrote mainly about totalitarianism, for a prestigious NY magazine on the famous or infamous Eichmann Trial in Israel. It is a first rate, intelligent, hard driving analysis. Her report concluded that Eichmann, though deserving death for facilitating the deaths of millions shipped to the gas chambers, was not a monster. Rather he was the embodiment of a average person ill educated and trapped in clich&eacute;s rather than language. He could not think beyond these hackneyed phases which he repeated over and over. So Dr. Arendt conclusion was that he represented the 'banality of Evil (the last line  in her report). This report and those words resulted in an eruption of anger from the Jewish and Israeli communities because at that time (1959) it was impossible for most people to see that this was a more damning verdict - for it damned not only Eichmann but all banal everyday persons complicit in the tragedy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't want to give anything away! It's a book full of surprises. You will like this book if you like books full of romance, lust, thrills, and it was a book that brought me to tears. I cannot wait to read the second book &#34;Losing Hope.&#34;

1936608898|5.0|I was a bit skeptical as I started reading the book.  I think this was largely from the shock of reading how everyday foods can affect the body and mind.  But now after 50 days of following their guidance, my life has changed.  I am no longer a slave to food or that next meal/snack.  Just as the book proclaimed, I now have a healthy relationship with food.  I look forward to simple, well-prepared meals, that satisfy me and eliminate ALL between-meal snacking or cravings.  It worked for me EXACTLY as they said it would.  And with the elimination of Wheat and Dairy, here is the short list of what I experienced:<br />- Sleeping soundly, waking up READY to go<br />- Dark circles under eyes gone &#60;&#60; a surprising result!<br />- Running/cycling faster and stronger<br />- Energy levels way up<br />- Excess body fat gone; clothes loosening way up<br />- Allergies gone<br />- Joint aches/pains gone<br />- Mood better; clearer thinking; no brain fog<br />- No need for between-meal snacks; late night snacking GONE<br />- No more bloating after meals<br />- No more craving for Wheat-based products!

B008220C38|1.0|To be fair, I have never read the novel which this is based off of. All I can say is that this film tries way too hard to be artsy and totally fails. I got up to do household chores midway through because it was so boring and ridiculous. The characters were vapid and underdeveloped (and miscast with the exception of Jude Law) and just plain annoying. This was so bad that it doesn't even deserve a full breakdown on why it sucked. Do not buy or watch unless you find watching paint dry interesting. My husband, who surprisingly sat all the way through it,  said it best (spoiler alert) when Anna Karena commits suicide at the end...\\"That was the best part of the movie!\\"

B006VFLIYK|4.0|This was the first book I read by David Baldacci and I thought it was excellent. The descriptions were worded so that I could imagine everything that was happening and almost see the places they were at. I really enjoyed reading this book, so much so that I purchased the next one with Will Robie in it.

B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|I read all the hype and favorable reviews about this new Rod album, but I remained quite skeptical. Was he really capable of recording a good album again? After those schlock-filled albums of \\"standards\\" that he's released during the past decade I really had lost all hope that \\"Rod the Mod\\" could excite again.<br /><br />Well, listening to this new batch of songs, I have to say I'm quite impressed. Rod has come pretty darn close to excitement once again. This isn't as magical or vibrant as classic early 1970s albums such as \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\" and \\"Never a Dull Moment\\", but I'd say it's on par with solid sets such as \\"Atlantic Crossing\\" and \\"A Night on the Town\\" that came later in that magical decade. Indeed, \\"Time\\" is a very strong collection of rock and pop songs that evoke those magical 1970s heydays when Rod was a rocker and released albums that moved you.<br /><br />Listening to songs like \\"She Makes Me Happy\\" and \\"Beautiful Morning\\" there is a feeling of triumph. You can't help but smile: It sounds like old Rod is having fun again! Okay, so maybe \\"Time\\" won't rank with his very best albums or conjure up flashbacks of \\"Lost Paraguayos\\", but there are enough truly great songs on here, brimming with energy and melody, that you can almost forgive him for his recent musical transgressions. Welcome back, Mr. Stewart!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun app but can be hard to work with on kindle fire; may be better on iPad.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|I mostly end up using this as a DAC/preamp more than for recording. For that it works great and sounds great. The only thing I have to ding it a 1 star to .5 star for is the fact that when you power it up via USB, there's no switching or relays to the analog output so your monitor speakers get a major pop. Drives me crazy, it's a loud pop too. Turn your monitors down or off when possible when you plug this thing in. I hope no one has blown any tweeters having their monitors cranked up when this was turned on. Now that aside, once it is on, it works great. Sounds good on playback. Headphone amp will drive full sized headphones to a decent but not loud volume before it clips/maxes out. Not bad though since some headphone amps cost as much as this whole unit. Recording, seems like decent preamps. Had to turn the gain up to seems like 70% to get good levels coming from my Behringer C2 mics. Kinda expected the preamp to be a little more sensitive but still good for the money. Sounds nice, no noise. Didn't have any driver problems, downloaded latest ones from their web site, worked fine on both PC and my Mac. Over all, for the price I'd give it 5 stars but for the speaker pop on power up. Still recommend it, great little box for home musicians, podcasters. Or even just as a DAC with preamp and headphone capability. Fact it goes phantom power and 24/96 is a nice bonus.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Excellent actors.  Excellent.  Loves me some Thor and gang.  If you haven't seen it .. it is a must.  AWESOME!
B0064J6OMO|4.0|Very funny.  Similar to Freaky Friday and it was pretty predictable, but I still enjoyed the laughs.  If you're looking for a movie to challenge your intellect, this isn't it; however, if you just want to relax and laugh, then this is a good pick.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Good action movie with an actual plot and a story without any gaping holes.  One of the better action movies I have seen lately.  On par with MI4 in my opinion.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book.  It was so well written.  It was a simple story that tugged at my heart strings.  I couldn't put it down.

B008Y7N7JW|3.0|So I didn't run out to the movies when this first came out, glad I didn't. The movie was okay but really nothing special.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love that it has costumes in it but I wish it had different minions you could use like Kevin!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a fun game that makes you be creative. Lots to look for in each room. You should give it a try.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Good movie that kids will enjoy that appeals to adults as well. Nice humor along with a noce story. Well done!
B00BX8PG4S|4.0|***PLOT SPOILER REVIEW***<br /><br />As a former submariner who rode these old vessels I found this film fascinating. One story was that the US sunk this ship. This movie presents a different version.<br /><br />The story is simple. The KGB goes rogue with a submarine with the intent of launching a first strike at the US, making it look like China did it. The film creates characters and internal conflicts to make the story interesting.<br /><br />Kudos to the film for getting the submarine terminology and capability correct. This aspect was more realistic than most sub films.<br /><br />There are some problems with the basic scenario. First off in 1968, China had only one Golf style submarine operational. It did NOT have launch capabilities. They wouldn't develop that until 1970. The second problem is that nuclear bombs have signature. We could figure out the difference between a crude Chinese graphite reactor bomb and a slightly more sophisticated Russian bomb. So the premise of the film while interesting, doesn't seem plausible.<br /><br />Another film goof was when they encountered the USS Skipjack. The Skipjack was stationed out of Norfolk and operated in that area in 1968. The submarine in the Pacific was the USS Swordfish, i.e. a Skipjack class sub, but not the Skipjack itself.<br /><br />The actors did what they could with a dry script. Landlubbers may find this film a complete bore and rightly so. We already know they fail. Extras include a talk about the real incident on which the film was based.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.
1781162646|5.0|Wonderful read. No current author can match King's sense of \\"coming of age\\" detailing, or put a reader exactly in the place of the characters. Many, many folks miss out on his talent thinking he is only a horror writer.....far, far from it.....when I pick up an unread read of his, I know I will close the final page a deeper thinker and with greater depth than before I read it....keep putting them out Stephen.....we r all better for it...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show! Amazing characters, story lines and fantastic writing ! I am Anxiously waiting for season 4! Season 3 was just as fantastic as the first 2! I'm hooked!<br />Hats off PBS!
B0000B1OFL|5.0|The Italian Job is an amazing action packed movie.  It is a newer version of the old classic movie of the same name.  It all revolves around the most impossible heist of the century that has been creatively and cleverly pulled off to great perfection.  It is a real true action packed movie that is a must see movie.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun if you have a very high level of patience.you have to save up for a very long time to get the stuff you need for your horse.other than that, it is very fun and entertaining.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|If you have not read the book, you may or may not like this movie.<br /><br />I really liked the book and felt that they did a decent job with the movie.  With movie length, they really could have added more without losing audience (might have actually gained more people liking it).
B00A2H9P98|4.0|The White House in under attack and only Tatum Channing, a wannabe secret service agent can save the world, the POTUS (Jamie Foxx) and protect his 11 year old daughter (Joey King). The movie follows a &#34;Die Hard&#34; formula.<br /><br />There is nothing overly special about this film. It uses the current world situation and creates stock political characters. The scenario ranges from improbable to impossible. Break out the popcorn and enjoy the feature as Channing bonds with his movie daughter and beats up the bad guys against all odds.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb. No sex or nudity.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|I have to say that I did enjoy this movie  about a retirement home for opera singers and classical musicians, however, it was a bit predictable. The music and scenery were beautiful and the acting, fine but there was a big build up for a performance that we were never allowed to see. That was a disappointment. Also, I felt it ended rather abruptly. That said, it IS worth seeing if you're a fan of classical music, as it is played throughout the movie.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|My 5 year old love to play this game.  And she loved the movie. So when I seen this app I had to get it. And for free I couldn't pass it up. Glad I got it.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This movie is a great action movie.  It is action packed with unexpected twists and turns all along the way.  One of the best movies that was made.  A lot of British actors and British humor.  It's a mix of a bookie who meets up with diamond thief. There are so many things going on in this movie it sure will be a thrill to watch it over and over again. A movie that will not let you down.
B00BPEWNZU|5.0|Many different songs much better than the newer music that is either screaming or low thumping base. Would recommend to anyone that wants something different than most other music out there currently.  Listen to the previews here on Amazon and decide from those if you don't like those then don't buy it a lot better than writing a review you don't like it or them.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Great movie. Love Bruce Willis in just about every movie he does. Nice plot and even better action. Buy it today!
B008JFUQ16|4.0|Former criminal and now nice guy Gru (Steve Carell) is recruited by secret agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) to find a bad guy. They set him up in a mall bakery. There is something about a redhead named Lucy working in a bakery that jogs the memory.<br /><br />While there are a few things for adult, the humor is geared at kids combining generic spy humor with fart jokes. Gru calling Mr. Ramsbotton, Sheep-butt got the biggest laugh among the kids. The colorful Candyland looking scenery along with the type of humor clearly indicates a this is for a younger crowd, i.e. tweens most likely won't be overjoyed sitting through it.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|I  can't say enough about this movie. I'm not going to go into the plot, as that's already been done by other reviewers but suffice it to say that it is truly amazing. With a refreshing  honesty I have yet to see an ANY movie, the characters make you believe that you are being allowed to follow them for a few hours, glimpsing more into their souls than just their conversations. I love the whole concept of seeing their relationship in 'real time', (over the span of 18 years-including the next sequel \\"Before Midnight\\" due out on DVD Aug. or Sept.). We not only see the changes in their physical appearances after 9 years, but also how their beliefs and expectations of youth have changed, or in some instances remained the same.. It's fascinating  and made even more so when you know that much of the dialogue was adlibbed by Hawke and Delpy. This explains the naturalness of their conversations. I loved every minute of the first movie, \\"Before Sunrise\\" and I loved this one even more, so much so that I purchased both of them immediately after watching. I can't wait to buy the third movie when it is available on DVD.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Took me some time to get used to seeing the walkers, but once I did I've addicted ever since. October 2013 can't get here soon enough!!!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very intriguing. Investigating rooms as if they were riddles. Kept me hunting for hours of adventure. Would recommend to anyone with some time on their hands.
B00008G7UF|5.0|Who doesn't love Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline, especially Kevin Kline as a &#34;Frenchmen&#34; to quote Meg, all you men are bastards. Another awesome movie.
B0019IB0II|5.0|If you want an education on current brain information, plus instruction on how to approach and help a stroke victim recover, this is the book to read.  The author is brilliant.  The trauma is real.  The recovery is amazing.  Read on!
B0088X7YMS|4.0|this movie was very entertaining, if you liked the first movie starship troopers, you may find this one to be good as well. It is done with CG graphics, the same way the movie beowulf was done. it gives it a sense of being like a cartoon yet at the same time a 3D aspect to it. There is action all the way through and to me was worth the time to watch.
B009WUBERW|3.0|This is unquestionably the big, dumb, rowdy action movie that I would have loved to see when I was sixteen.  The problem is, I was sixteen in 1994.  The cast is game, but a little past their prime and it shows (unfortunately) in a few sequences.  It's fun, but it's nearly two decades late for its own party.<br /><br />Still, the movie is a blast and far better than the first film.  Sylvester Stallone wisely handed the director's chair over to Simon West (&#34;Con Air&#34;).  West abandons the shaky, jittery, handheld look of the first film and gives well-framed and smoothly edited action scenes.  Unlike a lot of action scenes made today, it's easy to follow the battles - West lets the camera linger when it needs to, giving us a sense of what is happening and who is doing what to whom.  The repartee between the main cast feels more natural than it did the first time around.  Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are &#34;back,&#34; but their roles have been thankfully expanded beyond mere cameos.  We've got two decent villains played by Jean Claude Van Damme and Scott Atkins.  Some have complained that the hand-to-hand battles are too short, but I disagree.  The short fights have a greater sense of urgency.  After all, these guys are trying to kill each other right?  The fights are just as long as they need to be.  Most of the humor works, courtesy of a scene-stealing Dolph Lundgren.  Schwarzenegger goes a little overboard in the &#34;bad jokes&#34; department, but he still gets the best line of the film.<br /><br />So...about the presentation.  I'm not sure how I feel about this one.  The image is a little blurry and there seems to be artificial film grain added.  It's inconsistent from scene to scene, and sometimes even in the same scene depending on the shot.  I can't say for sure if this is a flaw in the presentation or a stylistic choice by the director.  Either way, it's a bad move.  No complaints about the soundtrack, which is crisp, clear, and gave my subwoofer a workout.  Amazon's HD presentation is on par with the Blu-Ray, so Amazon clearly didn't drop the ball...the problem seems to be in the HD master.  The image issues caused me to reduce my rating by one star.<br /><br />Bring on part 3, and pick a better film stock next time!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I had a Logitech G9X gaming mouse and it broke.  I was looking for a replacement to get me through until it could be repaired, but this mouse is great.  9 buttons and the responsiveness is what you would expect from a more expensive mouse.  The feel and weight is perfect and so far this one has been better than the Logitech.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun! I wish you could play random opponents, it's like I've leveled out and none of my friends are even close. I need a challenger!

B00BSBUZT6|4.0|I wish there'd been a separate DVD dealing with each of the songs. What its genesis was, who contributed what, how it all came together. These were the bits of the History that I found most fascinating. The inside scoop, as it were.<br /><br />Now. As for Henley & Frey and Don Felder...<br /><br />There's a bit in here where Frey is talking about the audio tape that Felder sent him and Henley. \\"Felder sent Henley and I instrumental tapes. Song ideas. 95% of 'em were cluttered with guitar licks, and we would listen to these things and go \\"Well, where do ya sing?\\"<br />And yet for 'Life in the Fast Lane', Joe Walsh is in the studio, warming up, and Frey hears him play what amounts to a dexterity exercise and says \\"What did you play? Play that again!\\" And then, after Walsh played it again, Frey says \\"That's the lick...that's what we should build the song around.\\"<br /><br />Uh... Right.<br /><br />So which is it, Mr. Frey (and Henley)? Funny how these two don't wax poetic about how Felder had the entire song laid-out (read his book), and moreover, quite dismissively frame what he'd given them. Yet Joe offers up this juicy piece-of-little...and they're euphoric over what 'they' then wrote.<br /><br />Grace, graciousness and gratitude. Apparently -at least by what the History presents- Frey and Henley were/are lacking in all three.<br />I get how the acrimonious credit/money issues rather spoiled their view of Felder, but come on; they're effecting revisionist history here. (And elsewhere.)<br />I'd like to hear Walsh's take on all this...even though he has too much at stake to be that honest. Same for Mr. Schmit.<br /><br />For the record, I don't think Felder was on as good behaviour throughout as he might have been. But really; there's a difference between people having moments when they rub each other the wrong way...such as, in marriages...and one or more parties in a group simply not having sufficient class to bring about a reasonable solution.<br /><br />In everysituation, someone has to play 'adult'. Unfortunately, in the whole Eagles imbroglio, nobody wanted to step up. Sad, really.
6304712499|5.0|what is there not to like about spawn. he kicks butt, he takes out whoever is in his way, and he does what he wants the way he wants when he wants and even though he makes a contract with the devil, he goes against it just to see his wife and daughter again and to take revenge on the man that killed him
B006O5Y75Y|4.0|&#34;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&#34; is a decent movie - it's exactly what you'd expect; no more and no less.  The performances are just fine (John Lithgow is a standout), and the performance capture work for Caesar (a fantastic Andy Serkis) and the other apes is emotive and convincing.  There are some nice touches, such as when Caesar communicates with another captured ape through sign language.  Little touches like that and attention to detail elevate this far above the diminishing returns of the original Apes sequels...and probably caused me to raise my rating from three stars to four.  The narrative isn't surprising, though.  Just your typical &#34;well-intentioned scientist plays 'God,' results run amok&#34; story.  The title pretty much gives it away...<br /><br />Amazon's streaming presentation of the film was fine - the HD presentation was crisp and clear, and I didn't have any problems with loading times or pixelation.  The presentation did seem a little too smooth - there was no film grain that I could see, but that may have been a result of the original production.  Entertaining and worthwhile viewing for a rainy afternoon.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because it's one of the best books I've ever read...... I was not able to put this book down until I finished it........I love to read but I was so intrigued with this book that it only took me an hour and a half to read...... I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone that loves to read as much as I do :)
B0051SDM5Q|4.0|As the author points out toward the end of the book, many comments he got from seasoned professional negotiators were along the line of 'now I know that what I do is the right thing'.<br /><br />The book gives a framework for a fact-based, goal-oriented negotiation strategy that allows to settle disputes and differences of opinions without seeing the other side as 'the enemy'. Many of the points raised in the book probably strike most of the readers as somewhat common sense, but the value of the book is that it puts all these points together and embeds them in a well defined and coherent strategy.<br /><br />I'd given 5 stars if the book had a few more practical examples and 'recipes', but it still makes a very good read.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|typical liberal movie, slow, over rated star power, acting weak, boring overall story line, almost fell asleep, would not recommend

0425263924|2.0|I expected so much more from Sylvia Day.  I enjoyed the first two novels and even retread them in anticipation of this book but this book was disappointing on so many levels.  On the positive side,  the writing itself continues to be good which I appreciate.  On the negative side the biggest problem was the meandering plot with crisis after unconnected crisis that ultimately I began to care less and less about.  It was almost like the game we played as kids where one person would start a story,  put the characters in an impossible situation then hand it off to the next person who would have to solve the crisis then continue the story, put the characters in another impossible situation then hand it off to the next person to continue the story.  Ms. Day continues to be able to write a sensual scene well but  these are beginning to get a little repetitive.  She did add a little kink this time (which were plot appropriate which I appreciate).<br />  The ending was the worst.  I had an intense visual image of the author sitting bac and doing a word count on her document,  realizing she had met her quota for publication then finishing out the paragraph before sending it to the editor.  And that nice cheery note from the author inviting us to continue shelling out the bucks because she's not done collecting yet.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I Love the book and am mentioned in it.<br /><br />Steve was a complicated man and a visionary. We're all better off because he was.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was the second Gillian Flynn book I read... And it, along with Gone Girl, made me a big fan! Hard to put down. Couldn't get through it fast enough, but was bummed when I finished. If you like thrillers with a strong plot, give this one a go.
B000S1L7IU|5.0|This guy can write a gripping, interesting story... this one has the usual hero pitted against the remnent of the Nazi's alive and well in Argentina... loved it.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|Finally I can read messages that I receive on my page. The regular Facebook app would just alert me that I had a message, but wouldn't let me get to it. I need this app and it has been great.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the writer's style and language choice.  It was a true pleasure to read.  And I thought I understood the whole story, but there were surprises along the way that kept pulling me in.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|So I may be a bit biased, but I absolutely loved this season. I watch Doctor Who on my Kindle while I work out. Makes it more fun for me!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Super fun game!<br />Hope they make more like it.<br />Controls are easy to use and upgrade system is simple and effective.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|A real mind-involving story. The DVD is now in my collection of outstanding movies.<br />In life, there will always be good/bad, weak/strong, hope/despair, love/hate and endings/beginnings.<br />We are not unique and neither are our thoughts or actions.<br />You may agree/disagree.<br />Either way, watch the movie and make what you will of it.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I thought Jack the Giant Slayer was a pretty good flick considering it's genre. Many times a movie of this caliber doesn't measure up to the hype that precludes it's release. It's not a movie I'd buy for myself, but I can see myself viewing this movie a few more times once it makes it's way to Netflix since I already have an account there. I rented the movie this time mostly out of curiosity. I don't feel I was short changed in any way. Worth the $3.99.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I really like this game.  It is really fun and cute.  And it is very easy to learn.  It will keep me entertained for a while.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Best show ever.....You have to buy the whole series. They are worth watching!!!!!!!  Love the good verses evil plot. I will buy all 8 seasons
B00CAZOHDO|5.0|Every song on this album is perfect. It gets me pumped whenever I listen to it. Fell in love with this band from the first time I heard them and had to pre-order the CD!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|A curious mixture of real world and magical fantasy, this is a modern day Grimm's Fairy Tale. A pleasant afternoon's read.
B000FA57US|5.0|Michael Myers is ruthless and full of rage in this Halloween sequel.  I recommend this movie to all Halloween fans.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|It had lots of action, imagination and fun.  Very gory though. My husband and I enjoyed it.  Probably would not watch it again.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|This is a fun game if you like crime solving games and puzzles.  I just wish there were more cases.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 was fabulous except for the need to do away with characters played by actors who wanted to move on.  It was heavy on the death factor.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|So enjoy playing dice buddies with friends.  It is fun to see how many people can play get playing a
B007BVOEPI|2.0|I'd heard so much hype about this show that I figured I should check it out.  I barely made it through the first episode and I'm definitely not bothering to watch more.  It's the perfect recipe to appeal to a high school boy brain.  Fantasy, violence, nudity, a paper thin plot, and pointless dialogue.  Of course, it's from HBO so I don't know why I was expecting different.  Update:  I finally decided to give the rest of the season a chance thanks to Comcast for making an offer I couldn't refuse.  The show gets better, but not much, worth one additional star from my first review.  I'm still trudging through it because people swear that it picks up.  I'm not sure how the pioneers made it through the first season to begin with though, unless they were all teenagers.  I guess they could have tons of time on their hands like all these people crying out in protest about my first review.  I can't believe how many comments this got.
B001P3SA94|5.0|Beyoncé was dynamic and beautiful in this movie performing as Etta James.  This is a must have movie for your home.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Usually I am able to predict upcoming twist, but I wasn't able to do so often in this book. I enjoyed this book and the twist & turns are clever. I wouldn't say this is a suspenseful novel; however, it was entertaining and the characters quirks kept me interested.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|August Burns Red keeps getting better and better. This is without a doubt their finest album. There is variety in the song writing, and the lyrics are excellent as always. On Messengers you could hit the skip button and not be able to tell you'd switched tracks. Not the case here. Each song is distinct and unique. The bass tone also comes out on this album. The vocals are clear and very raw. This album also demonstrates the vocal range more than any other.<br /><br />All around excellent.
B001DQ6I8I|5.0|The used LP I purchased was as advertised - nearly new.  The sound is very detailed and rich - better than the CD.  One big difference, however, is the LP simply is not big enough to hold all of the songs from the movie.  I wish they would have issued a two LP set containing all of the songs - in the same sequence as the movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A nice and challenging free app.  Keep up the good work.  I look forward to the update and appreciate the work that went into this.  Recommend this for any idle time one might have to kill.
B008DBF5Z8|4.0|Works well, easy to use. Good software. Lighting is critical, it is hard to set up for phones and tablets.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game challenges your mind, but is so fun and addicting. I can't play for any less than an hour at a time.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Buy...this...book. I'm an avid reader who's read hundreds of books across numerous genres and Zafon's Shadow of the Wind is my personal favorite. Beautiful prose, Dickekenseque characterizations, and a setting that takes on a life of its own.  Pure magic.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I bought the book having seen the trailers for the movie of vast swarming zombies.  The movie is clearly a different story.  The book, told as interviews post war by the survivors was completely enthralling.  The author's ability to change voice each chapter and bring the story to life with each character was simply amazing.
B00D3V85FA|3.0|Sometimes you just can't go back, while Ozzy is trying to create his long lost days. This album just doesn't come close, and if he was going for a newer sound, he didn't get that either. And the name 13, he should have just called it Black Satin, Devil is Bad, 13 has been done out. With his large knowledge of War you would think he could have really dropped some deep thoughts into his music.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was so happy to see the third season available on Amazon and with prime it was free.  I cannot wait for season 4
B005544TRQ|5.0|It has a great story line, good character development and just the right amount of sexual tension to make it one of the best series on TV.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I never thought I would love this movie as much as I did. Very, very good movie. Bring tissues.<br />Easily, the best movie I have watched with Gerard Butler.
B003SNKBXW|4.0|Arturo Perez-Reverte came extremely close to creating a masterpiece.  His prose is tight, his characters are believable, and his plot pacing is impeccable for 4/5 of the book.  Unfortunately the ending is rushed and it leaves the reader feeling slightly cheated after earlier brilliance.  Regardless, fans of thrillers and classic literature will find Club Dumas a step above similar genre books.  Do yourself a favor and add it to your reading list.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Was very moving and funny!  Really makes a person stop and think.  Have watched it 5 or 6 times since I received it.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Ultimate Bob Seger collection, Silver Bullet Band rocks!<br />I had forgotten how much fun these songs are to sing.<br />Definitely a fun album.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|This one of the strongest debut albums I've ever heard next to Pacific Air and the Neighbourhood. The vocal delivery is odd but works in tandem with the guitars, synths and piano. The instruments are layered beautifully and everything really fits together in each song. The band has proven that it can do great things and I look forward to their next release.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I usually hate drama books and stuff. But this book changed my whole perspective on what real books are. Great book AND a great movie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Tricky and makes you think. Glad I downloaded it. You should download it also. Can't wait for more levels.
B000QY9WOU|5.0|There will never be another Cher.  I grew up watching her develop from a shy teen to an icon. A genuine human being who has lasted through the decades.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|You cannot judge a book by its cover. How many times do we say this while silently or not so silently we judge someone due to difference. Meet, August Pullman, a boy with severe facial abnormality who goes from being home-schooled to placed in private school. Experience the cruelty he encounters as well as the tender mercies he is granted along the way. What separates this story is that you gain perspective from the other characters- some family, some friends, some immature villains and see how this sweet boy remains true to himself thus changing their minds and their hearts.
B004X2M9VY|4.0|Always a fun show to watch as good special effects and a good long ongoing plot.  Scifi yet lots of earth based stuff.
B00COH0W00|4.0|As easy as 123. Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz this is the alphabet. I don't have anything to say about the movie because my wife made me watch it.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. It was a bit cheese-ball, but thats okay. I read the book way back, and it was close enough. Anyhow, it is at least worth the few dollars that I paid for it here on Amazon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Use  to playing on my laptop. Found this app and started using it. No more stiff neck looking at laptop display.  Only down side of this app is that eitherI have gotten very good or the app has gotten a little to easy to win on.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I waited so long for this to Android worth any penny. If I should say anything i will comment on the multiplayer option. Andoid uses Bluetooth and iOS use ad-hoc or network. Give both devices both option so that it's possible to play across devices. Andoroid vs iPad.<br /><br />Everything else is just amazing :)
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|Captain Kirk, he is my favorite.  I love star trek period. The Journey to Babel is one of my favorites. I laugh so hard when Bones tell Spock and the captain to shut up. And brags that he has finally got to say the last word.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After many of my friends raved about the series, I tried it out and could see why. I started with Season 1 and continued through Season 3. After each episode, I eagerly awaited the time when I could see the next one.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I didn't get a lot of play time on this game because it kept locking up my Kindle.  I am not sure if this is a problem with the game or my Kindle, as it is new.  I hope I get to play it past the 1st level as I love Mahjong.
1609611543|5.0|This book is great...I have had skin eruptions and boils for some time and eating this new way<br />has improved all my problems..including inflammation.I highly recommend this book.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Probably one of the best tongue in cheek sci fi series that I have ever seen.  Loved all of the funky scenery and props.  The blend of country western sci fi was a stroke of genius.  I wish that they had continued to produce this series.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I have read the series this far, so I am a fan. And only a dedicated fan should read this book. I love Martin's writing, but I have to say that this is by far the worst book he has written. Where were the editors? It's way too long and it fails to advance the story more than a millimeter. You could read the first chapter and the last chapter and skip everything in the middle, because nothing happens! Well, it does, but somehow it all seems very boring and predictable. The copy editing is sloppy with errors in grammar and overuse of the same words and phrases.<br /><br />This book should have been released as two books. Then the first book would have been released sooner, it would have been shorter and the publisher would make twice a much money. The fans would be happy and the author not so burned out. I hope the next book is shorter, tighter and more eventful.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|It's a good move don't get me wrong, but there is a issue with the Blu-ray Codec on this disc, and on a fair portion of Blu-ray players including my Sony, the movie with freeze and skip around cutting in and out like a satellite program in a hurricane. I didn't watch it right away and am stuck with it. My one bit of comfort is that the included DVD works.
B000PY52EU|5.0|Risque, taboo, sexy, a little perverted, very hot.  Look what became of little Wednesday Addams!  OK, maybe VERY perverted.  But very cool in an off-beat, cult-film sort of way.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|I enjoyed playing this game, but it was more of a free trial than actually free.  It only allows you to get to a certain level, then locks the game until you buy it. Now I get to delete it!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  I first played it on the iphone and I love the Kindle version!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show! The acting & historical details are superb and leaves you with that feeling of excitement for the next episode.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|One of the classic goes right up there with Godfather 1,2 & 3...and Casino!  This movie is daBomb of gangster movies, its full of guys doing a bunch of gangster s***!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|The actors are great.The love the show.The sets are great. It all works. Lets see what happens next. Great show.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I've been a casual fan of Alice in Chains for the past 8-10 years or so and find most of their material that I have listened to to be quite enjoyable. I actually own quite a bit of their stuff if not all of it, I might be missing an EP or something, but I do own all of their studio albums to my knowledge, although I hadn't given the more recent ones many listens (as I just got Black Gives Way to Blue fairly recently actually, as I said I am a casual fan, or was anyway :P ) Anyways, on to the review.... The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here is a breath of fresh air when it comes to hard rock/metal music in general. Most of the songs and mid pace and fairly catchy and enjoyable to listen to. I first heard 'Hollow' quite a few months back before the album was initially released and I thought it was a pretty good song, but oh man has that song grown on me since I got this album! In my opinion there really is no weak song or moment on this album whatsoever. All of the songs flow really well together and the guitar playing is awesome, you can totally tell it's Alice in Chains without even thinking twice. I would say the standout tracks are: Hollow, Pretty Done, Stone, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, Scalpel, and Phantom Limb. I have listened to this album countless times since I bought it last month and can easily say it's an album that I have been wanting to hear and something that I feel that I am going to enjoy for a long, long time. If you are a hardcore fan of Alice in Chains this is a no brainer, if you've just heard a couple songs and liked what you heard, I'd say this is a solid investment for some great music from a great band. You will not regret this purchase, that much I can assure you of! Enjoy and always remember, if you enjoy an Artist's work, buy the CD, $10 from your pocket isn't much and it will help keep the bands afloat and making music. Peace!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|It's OK for what it is, but I know Gaiman can do so much better. I was really hoping for another American Gods, Stardust, Neverwhere, or even an Anansi Boys.  This just wasn't up to what Gaiman is capable of. That said, it's a fun little story, but again, he could have done so much more with it, spend a little more time exploring some of the characters backgrounds and motivations, etc.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I am not a fan of this version on solitaire.  I purchased the game and only played it a couple times.  I didn't like the layout of the cards.  I don't recommend this app!
B000SX88VW|5.0|Many people seem to dismiss this album as not as good as The Wall, Wish You Were Here, or Dark Side of the Moon. Personally I think it is better than The Wall. The lyrics are meaningful, the grooves a eloquent, and its classic Roger Waters. Don't dismiss this album because the longer you wait the longer you miss out.
B00015YVDG|5.0|Great ending was very special ,keeps you on the edge of your seat , great actors ,not for children great
B0064W639K|4.0|Good batman story. Good detective story. It's worthy of 4 stars. A good retelling of the origin of two face.
B0086700CM|3.0|I think it is okay. Is just that my daughters are 5 and 6 and it might be a little too complicated for them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing graphics! Very realistic. It is a great game for horse lovers. A lot better th than other similar games
B003VANOFY|5.0|It is way worth the Money. The Wireless capabilities are very advantageous and the sound quality is by far the best on it's class. It has lasted me over a year now.
B003BZ5FDI|5.0|This album is amazing! Its great to see how for John has come since his early solo career.<br />The first track is an instrumental that sounds like the sequel to Funkadelic's Maggot Brain. It truly is John at his best.<br />The second track is an emotional outing with some great vocal moments.<br />Unreachable, is very reminiscent of all the great things about Shadows Collide with People. Great thinking music.<br />God, is a little more upbeat, mixing many of the sounds John has learned over the years.<br />Dark/Light, is the soundtrack for a battle between good and evil. Excellent vocals with some amazing beats. The bass line repeats towards the end but its funky. Just note it goes from a choral display into this funky thing.<br />Heaven, breaks things down. Nice light track. Fabulous harmonies and guitar work.<br />Enough of Me,  another John great!<br />Central, a bit heavier than some other tracks. John displays his diversity in playing, singing, and writing.<br />One More of Me is Epic! The lyrics are some of the truest I've ever heard regardless of what anyone may believe. The orchestral music builds this ambiance with the vocals and lyrics. The vocals may sound weird to you at first but this song is amazing!<br />After the Ending is a great way to end the album! Light and tying all the thoughts together from the album.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Enjoyable DVD with some great moments.  Particularly wonderful are the segments with Jimmy Page, who steals the show as the white haired musical genius with a sparkle in his eye and young at heart smile.  He looks like Beethoven with a guitar in some scenes.  The scenes of him at Headley Grange are especially rewarding to watch.  The bonus features include some deleted scenes that...shouldn´t have been deleted, but at least they are there.  Overall, an interesting journey exploring three talented musicians and their relationship to their music and guitars.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Even though there are some significant unforseen twists it feels like it is taking a long time developing.  However the charatcters continue their development or demise.  I have not finished the entire season yet...............so maybe it could still get 5 stars!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|My dauthers really like this game .  Its like the old games we used to play with the old games, which I won't mention. I can't believe my daughters 5 and 6 have so much ability playing this.  I really like and recomend this game.  Its like mario bro and those game.  Good kids will enjoy.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Got this for my Kindle Fire,and was glad I did. Before that I could find no way of even accessing the camera feature. Probably was due to my own ignorance as I am still getting used to using a tablet.
B009AMAJPA|3.0|DEAD MAN DOWN is a movie with Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace who are two strangers who are irresistibly drawn to one another by their mutual desire for revenge.<br /><br />I will say that I was surprisingly entertained by this action movie by WWE.  An interesting plot that keeps you engrossed the whole way through.  Farrell plays the role well as he is well suited to this type of role.  I was also impressed with Rapace (who I believe played the foreign version of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) who does an solid job at playing the broken beauty damaged by a DUI driver.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't understand was casting Terrance Howard as the gangster thug.  I really thought that he didn't fit that role very well and that the movie could have been a bit better with a different actor in the role.<br /><br />Although this movie didn't do well in theaters, don't over look it as it is a good action movie and actually better than some better funded ones.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|There are some great moments on this album but overall it sounds over produced with only a hand full good songs. Pop artists are so worried about getting &#34;product&#34; out these days that they don't spend the time to make great records like they once did.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down even though I'd seen the movie first. I enjoyed every minute of reading the first book in the series and look forward to reading book two.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 seemed to flow amazingly well from Season 1.  The usual tense undertones between upstairs and down as well as the pending changes in life which cause frustrations for both those that see it and those that don't.  Breezed through the entire Season 2 in a couple of nights!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|My daughters loved it.  The drawings the animation is good. They enjoy it pretty much.  I would recommend this one.
B009O07NDY|5.0|My family and I loved the movie.  We couldn't wait to get the soundtrack on CD.  It has not disappointed us!  Beautiful music.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A great action packed movie that keeps you glued to the screen. One of the best movies I have seen this year!!
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|Not a great plot. Special effect were good. Watch this movie if your bored and have nothing else to do.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Awesome as usual one of the best writers going today. 5 stars for James Rollins can't wait for the next book. Sigma force rocks.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I had heard some talk of this song writer but never heard his music till now. I wish i had it 20 years ago. This is up to the same standards as  The Traveling Wilibys & Meatloaf. If you like music with an unforgettable beat & words you can understand & sing along with.... this is the CD.
B009XPGJYY|5.0|I wish that I had not waited so long to watchlist last four seasons in about two months can't wait for season five
B00A757EFW|4.0|Was pretty pleased with the  play of this app. Til now with  most Pac-man games it was difficult to change directions smoothly.  This one is pretty good. Some times you get a little frantic and go a little to far with your finger, but that's not the games fault.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Beautiful story, expertly delivered.  Neil Gaiman is a wordsmith and master storyteller and The Ocean at the End of the Lane is no exception.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|Sorry not my type of show. I need more action in  my type of TV Shows.  I tried it , but?
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|A great play that keeps your mind working and your brain going. Challenging and suspendfull at the same time. GREAT GAME!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Rodriquez is the Bob Dylan of South Africa. He is not known in the U.S. but that should change soon. I believe that he is a genius. the music & words that he wrote so long ago are still on the cutting edge today. I love music that you can listen to & gets its points across without having to use cuss words. I would recommend this CD to my children & grandchildren.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|buggy as heck. but its the best mtg game yet and on a (poor) portable device so that's a win.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My wife and I enjoy this game app, some rooms get a little complicated, but then there are cheats available on youtube if you get stuck.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game kept me engaged for hours on both normal and expert mode. If there is a continuation to this game, I will gladly wait! Awesome graphics and an engaging storyline!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|A young boy forming a strong relationship with his father. A father forming a strong relationship with his son. The two of them building a world class fighting robot. What's not to like?
B001AQIYJC|5.0|So sad but Loved it, Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan have great chemistry. Back when Nick did good movies.  LOL
B00B8M4IMK|3.0|Although it doesn't seem to charge as fast as the X5 dual USB.. I haven't given it a full load yet, but I'm already a bit skeptical of it's capabilities.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|An amazing continuation of two people finding love and working to keep it. Every person that embarks in a relationship will have adversities to overcome to maintain that relationship. Ana and Christian are two people that are no exception to the team.
B009GLHF5C|5.0|i hopped on the muse band waggon a little late, because i hated this guy who really liked muse. after finally giving it a shot, i loved it. this is like their sixth album, and it is sick! i enjoy dubstep/electronic, and theyve added that to their list of amazing genres to try... and succeeded
B00AEFXORM|4.0|I'm a big fan of Mann's movies.  This one didn't disappoint.  Strong acting.  Loved Jamie Foxx. I don't like Cruise much but he plays a good bad guy.  The film is dark and I think was filmed with real film not digital.  I like both.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|A boy and a horse - both unexceptional, grow to maturity under the worst of circumstances (war). How they lost each other, and how they found each other. Plus a happy ending. If you don't at least swallow hard, you shouldn't have pets.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|tons of fun. lots of addictive action. works great on the kindle fire. love it and all the upgrade options.
B007SNYQFC|5.0|I first read this book years ago.  The Boldt and Matthews characters are great as always, and the story is incredible.  This is probably the 10th time I've read this book, and it was just as good as the first time.
B005COO1X6|3.0|This is okay as a start but it appears to be a novel that petered out rather than a short story. I'm sure he could have expanded it if he'd wanted to.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addictive and fun. Find clues to go from one level to the next. A great deal of Colorado and number combinations.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME IS GREAT AND IT KIND OF RELATES TO THE MOVIE!! BUT ONCE YOU RUN OUT OF THE LITTLE COINS THEN YOU HAVE TO BUY THEM WITCH THEY AREN'T ALOUT OF MONEY!l
0670014893|4.0|I have been a big fan of John Le Carre since the Spy Who Came In From The Cold was released. His best work to me was in the cold war era, but I appreciate his style and subjects still. This has political ramifications which are relevant today, and you will recognize details from the news as you read the book. The curren wars in Iraq, over by most accounts, and Afghanistan, are relevant to the details in the story. You can make the connections. Good for today's audience. Highly recommended.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|It is a gem seek game with a mix of angry birds, but more fun and less frustrating. You have to sling shoot a monkey to capture visible and hidden gems plus his bananas. Great time waster suitable for all ages. Worth the space for me it is a keeper.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Such a great game to play with friends via Facebook and a great way to meet people from all over the globe. I enjoy the levels and daily tournaments. Highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys bingo.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The two main characters were more than flawed...He was so non-communicative, that I became frustrated, and she was totally crazy.  Her psychologist parents were so self-absorbed that they couldn't/wouldn't offer any assistance to her, although she seemed to be crying out to them always.  He seemed to be unable to understand any of her needs.  I never did figure out where his twin sister fit in.  I actually became depressed while reading it...hoping somehow that it would get better, but it never did, at least for me...It clearly was an uncomfortable book for me to read.  Overall, I would not recommend it to my book club.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Bourdain is an authentic chef and writer. I followed his career over the years and he is still going strong.<br />I love all his tv shows especially No Reservations and Parts Unknown.
B0019M2ITY|3.0|Love the watch, just glad it was for me and not a gift for someone else, because the box it came in was smashed to pieces.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Its an awesome show.. I love the characters. Very entertaining I would highly recommend this show to anyone. 5 stars in my book
0946535256|4.0|This book is GREAT! Shipping and delivery was fast. The accompanying cd is awesome. I would love for there to be a follow up book. I would recommend this this to all. I will say it more of a beginner book, but great none the less.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Typical politics on how they got the votes needed to pass the emancipation proclamation, bribery and blackmail. The movie was good not great. Too long, it should have been a 90 minute movie not 150 minutes. If shorter I would have given 4 stars.
0785156593|4.0|Yet another cosmic Jim Starlin tale of a near-god gaining omnipotence through some gadget (if it's not the \\"cosmic cube\\", then it's the \\"infinity gauntlet\\"), battling the strongest beings in the universe (Galactus, the Celestials, the Silver Surfer, Thor, Cloak... wait - Cloak?!?), ultimately coming to some conclusion (and several other Gauntlet-sequels).<br /><br />The tale starts off with Thanos and Mephisto hanging out on some galactic plane, Mephisto is kissing up to him. Great. Thanos has reached omnipotence and he's still out to charm Death, and builds several tactics for flirting with his cold, cold beloved. There's some crazy explanation that this is all at Death's bidding, but that explanation is abandoned in the first chapter. Great. So all of the heroes in the universe unite against Thanos, but led by Doctor Strange, the Silver Surfer, and Warlock.<br /><br />Wait, Warlock? Isn't he trapped inside a soul gem, one of the six that form the Infinity Gauntlet itself? Well... no, not exactly; sensing a date with destiny, Warlock engineers that he, Pip and Gamora come into the picture at one point, being weirdly reborn from the reanimated corpses of some hick New Jersey lowlifes. Strange. But it's nice to see the golden god returned to the land of the living, weird incubator and all. Doctor Doom shows up, but he doesn't do much (ditto for Drax the Destroyer, who sort of swarms about before being instantly defeated, more than once); Quasar (whoever he is), does even less. Yes, it's a very strange throw-everything-into-the-mix-and-see-what-works sort of approach. We even get to see Terraxis the Terrible, a sort of female Thanos, who doesn't do much (except for beheading Iron Man) until she, too, is expended. She really only came into the picture to make Death jealous (as if that was ever going to happen). Great.<br /><br />There are some strange plot twists - Mephisto convinces Thanos that he can win greater favor with Death by giving himself a handicap, before he realises how stupid that is and gets rid of Mephisto. He takes on all of the cosmit entities (the Living Tribunal, the useless Stranger, Eternity), and is put in his place by Warlock's crazy hissy fit (\\"A man always seeking ultitmate power and losing it as soon as he attains it! why? Because deep in his soul he knows he is not worthy of it\\"). Great!<br /><br />From his galactic fascist throne, Thanos plots the destruction of the universe (or at least several thousand sun systems), while also tormenting his granddaughter Nebula, who he's turned into a putrid living corpse (not sure who Nebula is, but she's later to develop a grand role in all of this). Eros (Starfox - Thanos' brother) is also horribly tortured, but he's seemingly less important - I know, it's all crazy. Of course, there's also the thing that Starlin does where he kills everybody off, only to bring them all back again (it was an alternate reality folded backwards into itself, then zapped with a ray that makes everything go back to the pre-destruction time - NOOOOO!!!!!). It's great action, and the turn-about at the end is really great, as is the slieght-of-hand that stops it from going all wrong yet again. Nice plot twists, great storytelling, and fantastic and freaky misadventures. Love it!!<br /><br />Warlock and the Silver Surfer chill out inside a soul gem and meld souls, Nebula attains cosmic power, all of the heroes get amnesia, and Thanos goes into a freaky, ironic semi-retirement. Awww...<br /><br />While the plotting by Jim Starlin leaves much to be desired at times, the art by George Perez is flawless. Love it all!!e realises how stupid that is and gets rid of Mephisto.

B00CH26TL8|2.0|Disappointed!  Can hardly play game before you have to start paying to play.  Dislike that social media requirements interfere with ability to progress.  Would not pay to upgrade this game.  A shame, love it on the computer version...can at least play repeatedly if desire.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|It's taken me some time to catch up on this series, but I have not been disappointed. Martin's third book is clearly the best so far, and I'm looking forward to the rest.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Entertaining storyline with engaging characters and great witty banter. I am very excited they decided to have it available prior to season 3 for new viewers to get caught up.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really enjoyed the premise of this game. My son played it along with me, and it kept us highly entertained. We hated to see it end! Can't wait for #2!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you love dogs, and who doesn't, you will love this book.  A fictional story about a dog's life through the dog's eyes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just the right balance for an interesting puzzle that is challenging and solvable. Good job. Looking forward to more levels.
0062200909|5.0|My 12 year old girls are huge fans of all things LOTR.  They love this book that shows how the movie was made.  Lots of information on how the costume designers developed the look of the characters, especially the dwarves.
B0015DROBO|4.0|very good reading. Interesting subject material. The author was very good in writing this book. I would buy this book again.
B001G70M6S|5.0|Worked perfectly in my two Polaroid land cameras. Scanning the negative has also produced fun results. I will be buying this film again.
B0095MVOMC|1.0|Upon loading the app for the first time, Avast antivirus found a PUP malware virus.  Needless to say, I immediately uninstalled the app! I won't download anymore apps from this developer.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|The book was literally the best one I've read since God knows when, I've watched the show so I keep on going \\"that not what happened in the show\\" but I think the book was better, but most books are better than the movie
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|i think the app is so fun itself, its just that i dont have a lot of time to play it and how you blow dry the hair i dislike but most of the many other objects are easy. i recomend it.
B00A9ET4MC|3.0|The book was basically about race and it got a little boring after awhile.  I also didn't really like main character.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is NOT 100 doors!  It's awesome and I can't stop playing. Sometimes the levels are hard and sometimes easy. But still, a lot of fun. If your going to buy this game, you should be proud.
B007TK77QE|4.0|It took me a little while to get into this novel but ultimately I enjoyed it. Felt like i got to know the characters.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love this book.....I had to stop reading at times because I was laughing so much! Ellen DeGeneres has such a great sense of comedy.....what a joy to read this book!
142314189X|5.0|I love That the characters have super powers and have relatable personalities. This series made for very interesting and entertaining reading
B00C81LYH2|4.0|I will just say it upfront: I am not a barbie collector, but my daughter and I both liked this barbie! She has a very beautiful white snowflake gown and comes in a red holiday box that looks nice. (though mine did arrive ripped but I can't fault that about the doll itself).<br /><br />Her head/face looks like she's wearing a lot of heavy make up, which suits the formal gown style and makes her look extra fancy. Other than that, really, (to me) she's just a very pretty, gorgeous dress barbie doll. My little girl does love her though.
B000I2MRHE|5.0|A few years ago I purchased this for my first granddaughter. She loved it and her little sister did too.<br />Now I've purchased the second one for my grandson, our number ten. He's still young but I know he's going to enjoy spinning and playing with this great toy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book and I have to say that one is not better than the other. They compliment each other well! I LOVED the structure of the book! I read it very quickly because I just couldn't put it down!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|after book one, this is a transition to book three. most of the action is in book one and three
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|We love this movie. As a family we enjoy watching this as a family gathering with friends as well. Avengers is a wonderful movie.
1612183956|5.0|Blake Crouch's Pines was an absolute blast to read. The story centers around a secret service agent awakening after a bad accident in a creepy idyllic Idaho town called Wayward Pines. The town is isolated and surrounded by mountains... and an electric fence. Ethan Burke, our secret service agent has no ID, weapon, or money. He is also hurt, scared and confused. He was on a search for two missing agents and now he is the one being hunted. The local sheriff won't help him, the townsfolk are weary of him, and the hospital staff are trying to drug him. All in all a very exciting and fast paced story. I am greatly looking forward to read Wayward.
0375826742|5.0|Everything arrived as it was supposed to, in the condition it was supposed to be in and arrived early.  You can't ask for any more than that. I didn't care for the ending of this series, hopefully Mr. Paolini will write more on this series someday and end it in a better way.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter says this is a really fun game with difficult levels. You have to find things like keys, pass codes, to use the elevator. You search the room for them.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I do not like this new format.  I liked the old site better.  It was easier to use by someone who does not know too much about computers.
1439153663|4.0|I really did enjoy this novel though I thought the ending was quick without a lot of elaboration.  I would have liked more details as to what happened to the characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Me and my cousin love playing this game and we love the movies too! If you love subway surfer or Temple run you will love this game.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Normally in bed by 9--now I'm up til 11:30--mighty late for an old bird like me, and totally out of character.
B00BMHFYVA|5.0|I bought his first album after seeing him open up for Beady Eye.  It was a good album, with a smooth vibe.  This album however is fantastic rocker from start to finish, even better than the first, top notch, give it a try.
0061124265|3.0|This is not in my usual genre, but it was worth reading.  There are few heros, and the carpe diem message is pretty clear.  It's short, and worth the time to read, but not particularly uplifting.
B008G12ERC|3.0|I got this CD mainly for &#34;Madness&#34; track.  I thought if that song was so good, the others would be too.  Not so.  I may also like the 3rd song but didn't really appreciate the rest of the music.
B000I9U75G|3.0|I found this movie boring and far below the bar. I was disappointed. It looks better in previews than it actually is. I only recommend this to you if you're a hard-core fan of this genre.
