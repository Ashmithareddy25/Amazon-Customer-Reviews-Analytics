B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. Every time i play it is like i cant stop!!!!!!!!! I hope you enjoy!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The story is so cute and relatable, as well as being funny and well-written. Well worth the free.99 it costs
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|I found the start of the movie a little fake; however, as it progressed it seemed to get better. It's worth renting, but I wouldn't buy it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A wonderfully written book. Defiantly in my top 10. I can't wait to share it with friends and family members.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I am not very savvy on my kindle YET, but this app is very useful for me because I am a visual person. I didn't know about the 2$ upgrade, but if I can figure it out I would be MORE than willing to upgrade. Very helpful and an excellent app. Love it!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Not too hard for a real novice at games and I like that it is a solo player game. Great time passer.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|not as much fun as previous Die Hard movies;  John's lines were more forced than the usual 'off the cuff' remarks.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|This book is a must read for both immigrants and Americans, it is very relatable, poignant and at times hilarious. I gave it four stars because the ending was so cliche.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|This Disney movie is sometimes forgotten about, but I personally think it's one of their best. Based on the novel &#34;Treasure Island,&#34; this movie combines futuristic ideas with the past, giving it a sort of steampunk feel.
B00BB8UJKG|3.0|There were times when I wasn't sure about the movie but everything turned our good. I wouldn't watch out with children though because it shows adults acting at the worst.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The app is great. I wish it wasn't so hard to get more points but still fun to play. I reccomend it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Obviously the cheap price brought a lot of people to buy this device.  I was lucky enough to just sneak in with the free netflix, so mine was really cheap.  I think the sky is the limit for this device.  I can't wait to try it on my parents/sisters tv as well; I'm guessing it can remember multiple wireless profiles.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Great writing leads to easy reading. Timely and interesting subject matter which would appeal to teen and adult readers alike. If you'd like to learn more about The's dog, Judge, this is the book for you! :)
B00DHRLK84|5.0|This is not your traditional zombie. I will not ruin it, I will just say these zombies are a bit different and I like the fact that they did not make the movie all gore and guts. This was one of my fav movies this summer. I will buy this movies once it hits around $15
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|The movie was all over the place. I had no idea what was going on and I was just as confused when it was over. 3 hour movie and no clue what it was about.
B000LTAY1U|2.0|Time is running slow even after an adjustment, it then slows down again after about 2 days.<br />Can not get the dates and days right, tried many times
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I really really enjoy this app :) it gives you diffrent settings and stuff to make your ugly butt look decent xD I should know.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I did not watch this series on regular tv. Have enjoyed the first season so far and looking forward to the rest. This show is just creepy enough and the characters are fascinating. Love this.
B007XELMO4|5.0|Rarely do I buy the advertising hype anymore, but this carrier delivers. It does everything claimed and way exceeded my expectations! Carries the camera securely and comfortably in the most demanding of conditions - assumming of course, that you have a decent pack, and balence it well - but that is just basic fundamentals! Buy it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|A really good app. that, so far, I have found to be startlingly accurate!<br />Had a bit of trouble getting our place pinpointed, well, we are in rural, really rural Ireland snd sfter a couple of blips this hopelessly inept android user got recognised and offered a very good service.<br />I delete from device until I want to have a look and it just pops up and shows me hourly and some longer term reports.<br />My opinion is 5-star user-friendly and it works too!
B003Y5H5JM|1.0|It has some scenes with stunning visual. For example, the scene where a human figure burst in to a water fountain.<br /><br />The acting is boring.<br /><br />In short, it's not entertaining.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|great movie, if you like Sci-Fi you should love it, plenty of suspense to add to the story and make it one you'll want in your collection
B000IDEQTK|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie but honestly it was just bad. The acting was poor and the dialog awful. The \\"twists\\" were expected and even if they weren't were just not that interesting. Plus, I didn't think she was actually a \\"Good Woman.\\" All the things she was doing at the end to redeem herself were still done terribly. I didn't really care about any of the characters.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|it is the best app on the song market it will rock your world best app ever on the kindle
B006LSZECO|1.0|I'd prefer zero stars for this book. Some stories can end so maddeningly,  but hold your interest. This book was a ridiculous story and it was full of pathetic characters. The plot was too ludicrous to believe. The plot self destructed. Even the setting could have interwoven some historical interest, yet failed miserably. The intense foul language and sex depictions were very low life and trashy. Ms Flynn' s book was a waste of time and money.
B0095P33IW|5.0|I've see this movie several times before, but never in HD.  I take that back- I saw part of it displaying in HHGreg.  That's when I decided I had to watch in when I got my 240hz TV and blu ray player.  Beautiful graphics from beginning to the end
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Who does not love Downton Abby if they have taken the time to watch.  So much fun seeing how lives were lived in that era and in that region of the world.  Love it.
B005V1WVPA|1.0|Maybe I'm too strong minded but, as soon as ol' johnny davis glorifies rape...I'm done. Sure its one song. Maybe two. That's too many. For new listeners, tthis gives a misguided idea of what that act is. Sure, we all are under the impression that bad things happened to him in his younger years....still not cool. I immediatley thought...\\"great, now I'm just angry and have no chance of enjoying this\\"....I remember being a kid when there first main stream album came out and always skipping the last track! Well, fast forwarding the cassette. Any who, had I have known that he would be screaming about raping someone and kissing their frown...I would not have even given it a chance. Oh, the beats are great?
B004HWYTP4|4.0|great movie featuring action stars of the past having fun.Bruce Willis is great,Helen Mirren is still sexy.good supporting cast..fun.looking forward to Red 2
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app very realistic and fun to play. Recommend to all horse lovers<br />Only thing I don't care for is how many gems it cost to get another horse or extras
B004WMKXWM|4.0|I liked it very much and I liked all of the movies so they are great, what else can I say.
0345525558|5.0|Gripping story right from the beginning. Wonderful how her story encompasses the meaning of flowers . Truly moving and engrossing story.<br /><br />Mark<br />California
B0026OR1UK|5.0|The Talent Code is a quick and fascinating read! I think about it continuously and see the world through new eyes because of it.<br />Daniel Coyle debunks myth after myth about talent that many of us have been taught to be true. It is liberating to read how and why we all have the ability to cultivate new skills.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|If you need a new show to watch then you definitely need to check out True Blood.  I am definitely a Trubie!  I love it!  It is unlike any other vampire show or movie you will ever see.  Check it out!
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Slydris is quite like Tetris in it's play mechanics. Fun game and great time for the price, grab it up you puzzle fiends!
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|This was the product Apple Geeks assured me would enable me to hook my i-Pad up to my flat screen TV.  I plugged it in and nothing happened. I contacted Apple Support and they couldn't help me either. Maybe it is my TV but this product didn't work for me at all.<br />  Gwen Lewis
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|Great Lemmings knockoff game. Download right away and enjoy this very deep puzzling application. I loved it and play it daily A++.
B00821OX98|5.0|This series will totally suck you into it after a couple episodes.  Really well done I highly recommend watching it.
B004LROUW2|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of this book.....the second half or so seemed like an exercise in endurance.  Was left with more questions than answers and characters unaccounted for.  I wouldn't recommend this unless you come across an abridged version.
0062020897|4.0|I came across this book when looking at reviews of other stories within the same genre and am happy I picked it up because Eye of the Needle is one of the better spy thrillers I've read! Between the detailed writing style, depth of the characters, and a fair amount of historical accuracy EotN makes for an exciting read that people from many ages can enjoy.<br /><br />A couple minor things I personally didn't care for was the predictability of the plot and a few areas that I felt slowed the pacing. Even when this story was first published in 1978 I'm sure the average person knew how the events of D-Day transpired. The main plot of this story revolves around a German spy in England discovering the vital information of where the Allies will invade and trying to Berlin in time, so already knowing the Allies trick Germany and successfully land in Normandy takes away from the suspense a bit. With all the facts presented in this book the author could've chosen a lesser-known but still important intelligence instead without affecting the story, or mixed in some more fiction.<br /><br />The pacing issues I speak of are due to the parts when this book shifts from a spy thriller to a romance novel. Since you get to know the characters really well, almost to a fault, you can't help but feel at least somewhat happy for Lucy when she gets the attention she's been craving for years, but these scenes lack the subtlety needed to keep the story moving at the pace it has throughout the rest of the book. Again, very minor criticisms, as are others such as continuing to call the spy by his code-name, Die Nadel, even though both his real name and the code's translation is provided fairly early on, but overall it's an excellent book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes WWII-era spy stories or thrillers of any kind. One other note, for those who aren't English, like myself, I found it made the story even more interesting by picturing the characters talking with the appropriate accent.nt.
B005GIS23I|4.0|movie was silly but funny good quality on the purchase will watch it again in the near future to get a laugh
1609611543|5.0|Although it hurts to be told the truth, feeling better and loosing weight are much more important!  Yes, I have a wheat belly.  I have been off wheat for 1 week and am loosing weight quickly. This book is really new to me.  The reasoning and conclusions are easy to understand and well written at the high school level.  Dr Davis has given very good reasons for the effect of wheat on the body. He describes the effects of gluten and the conversion of wheat starch to sugar in the body.  I am most impressed by the clarity and the &#34;promise&#34; of not being so hungry all the time and having more energy!  5 Stars from me!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy the game because of the varity of games to play. It's fun. It's nis on my Kindel Fire.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|objects are well hidden; must use your wits to use the objects in the correct order. I like the math used to find the hidden object. Looking forward to the next game.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Julianna Margulies shines! Loved her in ER, Love her in The Good Wife.  Story lines have some predictability, but like the whole cast and the chemistry between characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome I'm glad I bought this aweosome game + its cool and all that stuff.  I don't<br />know what is better
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|I feel like I've seen this movie over and over again. What happened to scary movies with scenes that make you jump and nash your teeth. After seeing so many previews why as I so let down and disappointed with this movie? WHAT has happened to the movies where you scream and feel like something's going to get you when you finish watching it? Can we please get some scary scenes somewhere, this was okay and although I wasn't impressed I would watch it again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I heard so much about this show.  I decided to watch an episode on my kindle.  I loved it so much I'm all caught up and can't wait for season 4.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|I am not a fan of zombie movies but this was a great movie. I was so impressed by everything that I saw in this movie, it was action packed and just a really great movie. I can't say enough about it I don't think there was one part that I didn't like. Amazing movie!
B004NS710C|4.0|The first time i seen this movie i knew i had to watch it again.these two went to the end to stop this train.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game. I just wish I had more tokens without buying them. It's fun play against people. I really enjoy it.
0425263924|5.0|one of the best books i have ever read. i love this couple and can't wait to see what happens next for them
B0026O475M|4.0|Castaway is one of those original, classic movies with brilliant acting by Tom Hanks and a story that makes you think.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I love both male actors.  my son asked if Tom Cruise was ever going to get old.  I loved it!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Decent game however costs money to advance quickly. Good graphics. Games become a bit repetitive after a while - something to occupy time when you are bored
B000B589JI|3.0|It look cool but as everyone in here knows that it leaks.. but problem solve by one of the buyer in here.. so, just take a card (cut like a ring) and put it under the outside ring rubber inside the cap.. problem solve..!!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|very fun game. good puzzles for kids.<br />my son, age four, loves it.  the story line is fun and intriguing.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved every single minute of it!  Wish the movies would go in to as much detail as the books do!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Is loved how uno has a card that give some one draw 4 card and if you fail you have to draw 6 cards.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this and it is a challenge to me.  It passes the time while I am getting my chemo.  That is why I wish I could get into my Word Search Fun.
B00CIHA0EY|3.0|Movie takes the nostalgia right out of what people knew TMNT to be.  May be a good movie for those who do know anything about the TMNT.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like it because it keeps me up to date on the weather.  It is very important to me while I am at the chemo lab because I have to use a walker to get to and from the car to the parking lot.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|This did not work at all not even my own router it could not get my pass word right.I tryed all avalible wifi connections in my area none worked.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I don't like the spider on the cover but it is a wonderful game and I have it on my p/c as well.
B00845PRDS|4.0|Awesome movie! I have seen a lot of similar action movies and this is one of the best.  Definitely worth it. I am disappointed with the Amazon video service. Not easy to use with an iPod.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great start to a new series. Can't wait to see where they go with it. I was impressed with a new style of alien.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A forth book would have shown how far they had come and what a good life it turned out to be after all the adversity
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|At first I didn't like it, but, as time goes on, I like it more and more.<br />Different than his others.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love it! IT keeps me busy when I have some free time on my hands. My 11 year old and I play together
B00COGY2P2|5.0|The story was excellent. I do feel that the character should have been played by a physically larger more macho actor. .
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Expected a 3 but ended up with 5 stars. The story was typical- boy loses girl, people lose planet, boy gets girl back, people get planet back (spoiler?). But what I loved was how it was told. The cinematography was beautiful, perfect editing, great acting, amazing script, and very cool tech toys!! TC might be crazy in real life, but I tell you what... he's a damn fine actor.
0765365278|3.0|I think fans of Robert Jordan's wheel of time series will love this book, and I can absolutely see why he was chosen to finish the series. He has the same infuriating pacing that forced so many WOT fans to abandon the series 1/2 way through reading.<br /><br />There are some truly interesting concepts in this book. The rules of the world are well through out and believable. The racial tensions and class systems are all pretty interesting.  The characters aren't terrible.<br /><br />Ok, great sounds like a good foundation for an enjoyable read except for the fact that it is extremely boring, tedious and redundant.  This book could easily have been distilled into 400 pages and been a fantastic book.<br /><br />I think modern author's all attended a Stephen King seminar where he urged them to fire their editors. Tolkien completed a trilogy in 1100 pages guys, lets get real here.<br /><br />Ok, so all that being said should I stick with this series? Does it improve significantly? I'm not up for another \\"Sword of Truth\\" experience where a few nuggets of greatness are dangled in front of my face and I read 1000s of pages of fluff hoping to get to that carrot again.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Nicely put together game with a good variety of puzzles. There are quite a few of the escape or point and click type puzzles where objects must be found and used in order to complete the puzzle. Everything looks beautiful and I have had no problems using it on my Kindle. Not a huge amount of replay-ability, but fun while it lasted.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This has become one of my favorite movies.  Although the acting at times can be a little rough I really enjoyed the real life actors because they were better able to display the raw emotions of a Navy Seal.  Also, the actions seemed more realistic and natural since this is an actual part of their job.  The movie was done in missions, similar to the way a video game is played such as Call of Duty.  To me this is one of the better war/action movies that has come out recently.
B005D9B26E|5.0|This is my favorite Who album, they were at their peak from 1968-1973.  Although it would be hard to argue with any album from that timeframe as which one is best.  I will not bore you with a review of the album and story.<br />I want to review the super deluxe version.<br />The album 2011 remaster:  Nice update, but not the reason that I upgraded.<br />Quadrophenia demo's:  I have heard many demo's from this album before, but not the entire collection.  It is interesting to hear the arrangements and tracks that didn't make the final album.  The Who take Townshend's demo's to new heights based on the rule established during recording: Energetic Musical Rage<br />5.1 surround sound:  So first of all this is not the complete album, wish it was.  But this may be the only opportunity that we will hear Quad in surround sound.  Bob Pridden did an excellent job with the surround and every song is amazing.  As with many surround sound recordings, you hear elements/instruments with much more detail.  The Real Me is dominated by Entwistle and Moon, the instrumental's (Quad & The Rock) have remarkable detail.  The finale of Love Reign O'er Me is over the top.<br />If you appreciate surround sound music and Quad is one of your favorite Who albums, I would definitely consider the purchase.<br />Let's just hope they revisit Lifehouse in the near future.<br />Cheers!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love hidden object games, and I have to say that this one is by far my favorite of all the ones I've downloaded so far. I highly recommend this game to all who enjoy these kind of hidden object games. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!!!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Before I knew it, two hours had disappeared and it was time for bed and I still didn't want to turn it off.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|MacGyver is the man. If he can't solve a problem, then nobody can. Even with the cheesy music, 5 stars for a childhood fave. Watch it... You won't be disappointed by his skills.
B00E1L9N8E|4.0|I feared this movie would be absolutely horrid, so I waited until it was out of the theaters to watch it. As it turns out, it was actually much better than I thought it would be. The only real complaint I have is that the modern music was very jarring and I had to grit my teeth until it passed. I'm thankful though that some music of the period was included as well or it would have been unbearable, no matter how excellent the actors may have been.<br /><br />My synopsis is that it's worth watching, but I'm still waiting for a true interpretation of the book. So far, it is yet to have been done.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I can't decide if I liked the book.  First half slow but couldn't put it down by the middle. I loved Gone Girl!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|It was about time this got on the Kindle Fire! This game is so much fun and highly addicting. Loads of fun and much replay ability.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This continuing story was just as riveting as the Hunger Games. NEW twists and character development kept me awake and reading well past my bedtime.
B007V693YK|3.0|I guess it's OK for tab, the scrolling feature is nice. The big issue is the SEVERE lack of available titles
0307951529|4.0|Once I started reading this book it was hard to put down and I finished very quickly. Although it focuses more on online businesses or service based business, there are a plethora of great ideas that can apply to any startup, or even growing a current business. Also, a lot of his studies were people who started something without profit intentions, so I think it's a great book to read so that you are more prepared when one of these situations happens to you.<br /><br />There were a great number of concrete examples from participants in his study that started a lot of ideas kicking in my head. This isn't a step by step on how creating a startup or a book to tell you what do sell/offer. It's a guide to help you make your ideas/services profitable, desirable, known, and overall successful, through real life examples. It also will give you some guidance on how to deal with increased business and that the customer might not always be right. More than anything I think it's a confidence builder and motivator to get the ball rolling.<br /><br />WHY I GAVE IT FOUR STARS<br />The only reason I did not give this book five stars was that it primarily focused on online based services I was hoping for a bit more product based examples. However, if I knew this I still would have purchased it.
B004W4N55C|5.0|This is pretty decent, It would be nice if it remembered your preferences & had a way to store tabs on the Kindle Fire HD (Maybe it can & I'm to dumb to figure it out)
B00797MB0O|5.0|I adore this movie. It took repeated viewings for me to realize that. Young Adult is depressing. The first viewing left me empty and nostalgic for the early 90s. A bummer sensation, but accurate, because that's how Mavis feels! I returned for Matt (Patton Oswalt) and Mavis's (Charlize Theron) chemistry. They are fantastic together. I hope to see them in future scenes. I'd go so far to say this is my favorite Charlize Theron movie. The actress is funny! And dark!<br /><br />If you are the type of person that has gazed around the gym, mall, Cineplex, Applebees, or corporate office space, slunk your shoulders, and thought to yourself \\"I hate everyone in here,\\" then this flick is for you. Mavis and Matt are in your camp. She is a total bitch, but the film successfully shows how she has reached this point. Broken people relate to the world in a negative way. We have unhealthy coping mechanisms. Relief comes when you make a connection to the one other person in the room that understands. The films that provide that same relief are rarely made, but I'm so grateful when they are.<br /><br />Thanks Jason Reitman, Diablo Cody, and the super rad cast. You made art! Film lovers dig!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|When I reached lvl 50 there was a meaguse u just completed th game good job ...... then when I reached a lvl higher 51 it said  WUT THE HEACK R.U DOING
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Christina McKenna's &#34;The Misremembered Man&#34; is a delight to read. I didn't know what to expect not having read this author before. And what a pleasant surprise this book turned out to be. A wonderful mix of laugh out loud moments mixed with such poignant, sad reflections. The characters are so very real and flawed that you can't help but embrace this novel for its enthusiasm and enjoyment. It is rare to find such a well-written novel and so deserving of a 5 star rating.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Scrooge got what needed to be done by being scared to death by the spirits that visited him. If he didn't do what they showed him what happened in the past present and future, he probably continue down the path he was on .
B000HL09SA|5.0|Willie Morris writes a great book and this movie proves it. This is a movie for the whole family at the same time. Wish they would go back to family movies!
B0082Z1CVQ|3.0|Loved the funny parts of the story. The sad parts made me cry. The funny parts made me laugh. All in all,a wonderful story
B005VPRETE|5.0|This is a typical Lego Friends package and it lives up to expectations. My daughter has been collecting these sets for about a year now and she has as much fun with this set as any of the others. If you are familiar with and like Lego Friends then this set will not disappoint.
B0091REZMW|1.0|It would not down load onto my Kindle.  After trying 3 times, I gave up.  Not sure what happened to create this situation.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I love Zombies and the trailers for the movie looked interested... so I expected a lot from this book. The story is good, but presented in a way I'm not familiar with. As a result it feels a bit disjointed as you never really return to find out what happened to certain characters in the book. Overall I was happy with the read though
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game, Buy it, lol you will get addicted, and your friends will too , I know mine do
0316228583|4.0|This is a well written book but it is not the magical world of Hogwarts. It is the ordinary world of Pagford and yes in this small town there are some crappy people who have crappy things happen to them but that's life. I have to say it is refreshing to read about characters with real flaws, especially the teenagers. I work in education and yes kids do drugs, bully, drink, have sex, hurt people (including themselves) and aren't always the hero. And so called pillars of the community usually have skeletons in the closet. This is a story that intertwines several families through a series of tragedies.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Good story.  Enjoyed reading the book.  Well written and easy to read.  Good series.  Can't wait for other books in the series.
1623360277|1.0|The book is stupid.  I am getting ready to send back.<br />I would not recommend this book.<br />Doesn't really tell you anything you do not know.<br />I eat potatoes anyway..... DUH.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I did not know you needed at least three players when I bought this game.  I was hoping it would be something my girlfriend and I could do by ourselves but it doesn't quite work with two people.  We did make our own rules where each player plays two groups but it makes for a confusing pile of cards.  Still, whenever we have another player we usually have a good time.<br /><br />There's a Star Trek themed version that I wish I would have known about.  Same basic rules just with a Star Trek theme.
B00B81B0HC|1.0|The music sounds like it's been done with a computer. All of the songs are horrible. No creativity whatsoever. No originality. I don't even like Radioactive. Their music did not even impress me. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. Your ears will thank you.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Forget Robert Downey Jr.'s interpretation of Sherlock Holmes and enjoy this excellent take on history's greatest detective.  The acting on all levels is superb, the plots are wonderful and hold your attention, and the combination of suspense, drama, and British humor are perfect.  The three stories in season one are more like mini-movies than TV episodes, so make sure to set aside enough time to watch without having to worry about a deadline.  Oh yes, and if you're like me and sometimes read the newspaper or do other kinds of activities while watching the telly, set everything else aside and totally immerse yourself in some great and fun adventures.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|One of my favorite classics of all time. I love Audrey Hepburn...nothing else to say about this movie but  this annoying website is making me use so many words.
0399255370|5.0|This is a cute book.  I am hoping to read it to my kindergarteners and they will begin using more colors in their drawing and writing!
038533348X|3.0|For when it was written, it has some interesting parts.  The younger crowd wouldn't understand it and the older ones might be bored.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Day one with this game and I can already tell that it's going to be addictive. Super fun. And my kiddos love it too. Ages 4 and 8. Fun game for the whole family.
B005XO38KW|5.0|I'm not an avid reader, at least when it comes to fiction, but I really loved this book. Oscar Wilde is a fascinating person in general and a lot of his personality bleeds through in the dialogue. I've never read the censored version of the text, so I can't comment on any changes. There are certainly some rather blatant references to homosexuality, but that's by no means a bad thing (I may be a tad bias here). The only thing I might pick out as a flaw is that the book reads a bit like a screenplay, but that's an unfair criticism given Wilde's background. Honestly, I can't say much bad about it at all.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|it is a fun and fairly easy game. I could let my granddaughter play this and she would like it too
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Many versions and ease of use make this an excellent app for my new Kindle Fire HD.  I'm very pleased!
B0002O7XWC|5.0|My dad LOVES this movie.And because its older its pretty hard to find in my area (small town) So I was so excited when I found this for him! It arrived on time and wasn't damaged, and I had a very happy dad lol.
1250012570|5.0|I am an avid reader, I have read hundred of books in my short 17 years, but this book made me feel so many emotions I had never even felt before. One minute I was laughing at Eleanor and Park's sour humor, next I was sobbing. I related to Eleanor like I never had to any other person, I felt like I knew her, I was her.(Without a Park unfortunately) I so badly wanted this book to go on forever. When I got to the last page and read those last few lines, I was crying hysterically. Having gone through sexual assault, being bullied, being overweight, being a misfit, being awkward,I related to every single line, I relished in it as if someone else, maybe, understood me. If I could meet Rainbow Rowell I would hug her and thank her for summing up everything I've ever felt and condensing it into so few pages. Every line is tattooed in my heart, just like Park's number on Eleanor's heart.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a great game it's so much fun!!! So worth downloading!!! This is the best app I have on my kindle fire!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I would actually give AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED 4-1/2 stars but the graphic doesn't extend that option. Find yourself a comfy chair and become immersed in Hosseini's tale!
0062238868|4.0|This book is a great read. It's less like an autobiography, and more like sitting with Chris Kyle and listening to war stories over a beer.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I really enjoy all things BSB and this album is full of great songs.  If you are a fan you should get it for sure!  If you are a casual pop fan you may want to check out the audio samples and see if it clicks with you.
0316044695|4.0|This book is fantastic. What Marcus Luttrell and his men did is nothing short of amazing. It's like reading a blockbuster action movie, except it's real. You won't be disappointed in this book at all.

I have yet to solve all the puzzles in this book yet so I'm getting my money's worth. I actually expected to have an easier time with the puzzles in this book but that's not the case but it's no fun if they are too easy is it?

0345803507|2.0|I don't know why I made myself read these books, maybe because everyone was always talking about them.<br /><br />This is one of the most abusive relationships in a romance books I have ever had the displeasure of reading. I wanted to yell \\"Get a BACKBONE, GIRL!\\" I mean seriously! When is Fifty not angry with her? Ana went out with her best friend, Christian gets angry. Ana disagrees with him, Christian gets angry. Ana doesn't want to eat, Christian get angry. A man flirts with Ana, Christian gets angry. But its ok for him to hang out with the one woman Ana doesn't want him to be around? Ana is irrational. Ugh!<br /><br />Don't get me started on the repetition. I love him, He is perfect, That pull in my stomach, My inner goddess. Blah, Blah, Blah. We know already! Get some new material for crying out loud! (Makes me wonder scared to see what books Ana is publishing.)<br /><br />Honestly, I have several issues with this book series but write1 has already covered them for me and I don't want to waste anymore time on this series!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|One of my favorites from my childhood. So glad it is finally on Blu-ray! If you are a Twilight Zone fan, you might notice that most of the props in this, from Robbie the Robot down to the instrumentation in Morbius' lab are all in one or more Twilight Zone Episodes. Even the space ship makes it into a couple. Loads of fun is this movie.
B00493E1GI|5.0|It was really well done and I loved it and I bought it and I watch it over and over. :)  Feel good chick flick movie.
6305428557|5.0|I have never heard of this movie, but happened to catch the last part of it on TV and liked it so much I bought the DVD (so glad it was available!). Just a nice, quiet, escapist movie. Highly recommend it.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|It is a spoof and its good fun and great cast.  He's Bruce all the way with his it in this one.
B00AEBB8BU|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies and I am not even a Robert Redford fan. But this is a great movie. Blu-ray makes it even better.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Could have been a little more plot or deeper, but good premise and he's a hunk!  Come on, hunk time.  And it had good futuristic toys... :)
B001B51B9M|5.0|I have now seen this movie so many times that I am thoroughly SICK of it! But my wife still loves it so I will continue to watch it until she becomes sick of it, which will probably be never. Oh joy.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Watched this with a girl, who is a huge fan of romance and zombies.<br />Funny, well paced, knew it's limits, didn't pretend to be something it wasn't, no complaints
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Great English translation.  I especially like being able to look up words with a simple touch, makes it a lot easier than having to open another page to find definitions.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I love this film & watch it at least once a day. The four principal stars worked beautifully together; it was so nice to see a love story between older people. I am 68 so they are my people. Pauline Collins, who plays Cissy, is exceptional. Much of the cast are real musicians & singers of a certain age; since the story takes place in a retirement home for retired musicians,  this makes the story more believable. It is a real feel-good movie. I heartily recommend it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game!!! Finished it in an hour on and off super duper nifty!!! Please make more games like this!!!

B008OJ291W|4.0|It goes without saying that a butt-load of changes can happen in 35 years and this CD is such a prime example. Yea, I know, big fat hairy deal, but still, some people tend to turn a blind eye on this obvious hard fact, and in this deadly blind spot intersection of nostalgia and music, it can be brutal for one's mortality, much less the ears. If you listen to too much `classic rock' radio, you know exactly what I'm talking about....should you choose to do so.<br /><br />ELO is known for, if not anything else, their elaborate panoramic sound! When you create a band that was meant to be a follow-up to \\"I Am The Walrus\\" during an era where creative indulgence is encouraged, how can it NOT go anywhere else but up, big and wide and this band and its leader Jeff Lynne where glad to fill in this huge canyon.<br /><br />...and now some many odd numbers and changes of tastes later, it seems that the only elaborate and panoramic things are left are your waist line, U. S. industrial war complex, Wal-Mart and the collective egos of politicians and celebrities who demand to taken seriously before they get flushed down the can of irrelevance forever. It's easy to complain that change can be a bitch and there are too many examples out there to make one go all later-day George Carlin on everyone's ass.<br /><br />Now, in Lynne's artistic case, gone are all those strings, keyboard crescendos, cool flashy spaceships and the era that demanded it. It's now 4 by 4 beats and lo-fi recording that is, literally, recorded in his garage. Not exactly high flying esthetics of yore, but you can't against him though; it's what he had to do as an artist. However, this CD might not help his case much with many older fans.<br /><br />For those who demand the glorious days of ELO yore, this re-recorded version will force you to face that blind spot. To be honest, you more thin-skinned fans should have seen this coming when Zoom came and went in 2000.<br /><br />....and much like Zoom, this set is ALL Jeff Lynne doing pretty much everything here, just short of coloring the CD covers individually with crayons. He always claimed to be a studio animal for decades and this version of \\"the band\\" reflects it. Hell, look at the condition of the Out Of the Blue spaceship on the cover. That's not just lo-fi, that's a floating insurance risk and, to be honest, I didn't take this as a good sign when I first saw it.<br /><br />This sets off in tall order with the legendary title track. Only Lynne has the nerve to climb this panoramic mountain from the get go with his lo-fi equipment and mindset.  Even the strings were provided by the Midi-equipped guitar of Marc Mann. See the Zoom Tour Live DVD and watch him do the violin solo from Livin' Thing in his guitar. Despite the odds, he has pulled this off okay. However, there's no thunderous coda to send this new version off into the galaxy. I suspect Jeff didn't want to push his luck that far.<br /><br />Tracks like Don't Bring Me Down, Showdown and 10538 Overture benefits greatly from this downgraded sound as they originally never relied on a 40 plus piece orchestra. They sound a little more organic and intimate. Not much updating or tweaking is needed. `But what's the freaking point you might ask?!' you might ask. Unofficially, some bands like Def Leppard and Kiss are re-recording their catalog out of spite of their old labels cheapness and politics and I'm sure this CD will be roped into this discussion. Officially, please refer to Lynne's liner notes. I've bored you enough with my little unprofessional words.<br /><br />Telephone Line and Strange Magic dose manage to capture that sound of yore...more or less and Turn To Stone doesn't fare well as the limitations of Lynne's lo-fi sound seem more evident. There are some components of the old sound that he can't replicate in his garage.<br /><br />The bonus track, Point Of No Return, dose prove an all-important consistency in Lynne's cannon and that is the hook, especially whenthe chorus kicks in...and that's when you wish some actual strings would kick in and sour this piece into the blue.<br /><br />Ah, hell. Oh, well. There's my 2007 CD edition of the monolithic `Out Of The Blue' that should keep that sugary `old yore' buzz of mine in check....I just have to be careful when its bonus track, `Latitude 88 North', comes up. The strings on that one is pushed so far back that you can hear Beethoven roll over and puke his guts out.the chorus kicks in...and that's when you wish some actual strings would kick in and sour this piece into the blue.<br /><br />Ah, hell.

B009VIZDLI|5.0|From the opening page, this book grabbed me. We all know someone like Don, but to view life from his perspective is enlightening.<br />This is a fast moving story, with many belly laughs, and most important a good ending.
0062255657|5.0|Books are strange and magical things. Sometimes they are merely entertaining ways of passing time, or ways of acquiring information. But every now and then, something happens that manages to take you out of yourself and reminds you why this medium -- sometimes so seemingly anachronistic in the current day -- continues to endure when all other forms of entertainment are so much easier and less labor intensive on the part of the consumer. It is the moment that occurs when you stop thinking about the fact that you are reading and you lose yourself in the story. In that moment, your eyes are no longer merely skimming over words on a page (or, now, a screen) and conveying information to your brain. When it happens, the noise of the subway, the distractions of the day, the stress of work -- all of it disappears, and you enter into a sort of partnership between yourself and the author to create a world in your own mind -- a world that seems more real, at that moment, than the world around you. It is a bizarre and oddly intimate moment, and it has a way of changing the reader.<br /><br />  This is the moment that I live for. My first conscious memory of it happening was when I read Roald Dahl's Matilda on my own, late into the night, way past my bedtime. I have spent the rest of my life chasing those moments, and remain aggressively recalcitrant if anything gets in my way of this pursuit. Even ordinarily well behaved children who would never otherwise disobey their parents will stubbornly defy the laws of bedtime to continue reading a favorite book. Neil Gaiman understands this better than any other modern author, and his latest novel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, captures this feeling perfectly.<br /><br />  For the first half of this short novel, I was reading with a critical eye. It seemed, at first, like a rehashing of other things he has done before -- a shy, bookish young boy, the scary world of grownups, myth and folklore... those of us that have been waiting for a spiritual successor to 2001's American Gods and wanting another huge novel will be disappointed, as I was until I was about halfway through the novel.<br /><br />  Then, without realizing it, I found myself sucked in and was unable to stop reading until I finished. This is a book about childhood, but it is not a book for children. This is a book for adults who remember being children. Written in a fluid style that seemed comprised of the same stuff as the mystical ocean in question, the book rocked me in gentle undulating waves until I arrived at the far shore, with the sense of having taken a journey that somehow seemed much bigger than the sum of all its parts. By the time I shut the back cover on the final tear-stained pages of the book (oops), all of my nasty criticisms were gone, and I remembered why the 15 year old version of me at one time wrote \\"Gaiman is God\\" in his Livejournal and used to pull out all of his books at Barnes and Noble to make sure people saw them on the shelves as they walked by.<br /><br />  One of the recurring themes in Gaiman's work, and one that is close to my own heart, is about the power of stories and how these stories shape us, both at the core of our character as individuals as well as the course of our lives as a whole. The Ocean at the End of the Lane continues Gaiman's exploration of this theme in his most powerful and effective way yet, and somehow transcends genre and almost seems more like myth than literature. There's something timeless, sad, and beautiful about it. There are shades of Bradbury's Something Wicked this Way Comes, but this book actually hints at darker things than that and manages to avoid Bradbury's sometimes syrupy sentimentality. This is a book that does not romanticize the sometimes terrifying world of monsters and brutality that children inhabit. If Roald Dahl decided to write a book after studying both H.P. Lovecraft and W.B. Yeats, it might be something like this.<br /><br />  The meat of the storydeals primarily with a young boy's struggle against forces -- both human and other -- that are large and beyond his power to control, as most things seem to a seven year old. The events are told through a middle aged narrator struggling to recall his boyhood, and the fuzzy and sometimes incomplete memory serves to remind us that childhood in general seems almost like an insane half-remembered dream -- or nightmare. And, like a dream, childhood sometimes seems, when observed from a distance, to follow its own maddening lack of logic and consistent, linear narrative.<br /><br />  The broadly drawn villains in this book are more layered than they appear at first, but the true creepiness lies in the things Gaiman doesn't show us directly, things that lurk in the corners, around the edges -- things that exist over or under our own reality that are hinted at. And yet, for all its otherworldly horrors, the most frightening and powerful moments in the story come not from any supernatural elements, but from the very real and very human acts of menace and cruelty. As the narrator points out -- the true terror wasn't that he had to face a monster, but that the monster was a grownup, and grownups always win. There is one scene in particular between the boy and his father that disturbed me and will remain with me for some time.<br /><br />  For all its darkness and menace, there are also moments of real beauty in these pages. Gaiman's prose, which sometimes suffers in longer works (I think he's always at his best with short fiction), is sharp and focused here, but without feeling detached and clinical like many modern works that go for minimalist descriptions. The boy's quieter moments with the three women in his life feel like a safe and welcomed respite from the darker moments of the story -- you feel you are right there in the kitchen with him, being warmed by the fire -- and in his whimsical descriptions of the farmhouse and its routines, there are also shades of The Hobbit. All of these parts together create something that is surprisingly original and unmistakably Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />  Gaiman has said that this started as a short story that gradually unfurled itself to him, and perhaps that is why it manages, more so than his other novels, to maintain the tight focus of his shorter works while still managing to cultivate the sense of wonder and emotional attachment that comes with being able to spend more time with the characters involved. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is, if nothing else, a love letter to any of us that once sneakily brought a flashlight and a stack of books to bed with us, creating a sort of late night anarchy in our developing minds that took us to places parents and teachers could never quite follow.

B00D7JGL36|5.0|The only thing bad about this CD is that it only has ten songs on it.  Every time it's over, I'm left wishing there were more songs to listen to!  A nice blend of very familiar songs from Buck and Hag, but also some solid tunes you may not be familiar with.  The instrumentation is top-notch and Vince sounds as good as ever.  For those of us who miss \\"real\\" country music, this is a must...but anyone who appreciates good music will enjoy it, too.
1781162646|4.0|One of the best things about being Stephen King, I imagine, is that he no longer has to prove anything to anyone. He's Stephen King -- he can write whatever the hell he wants. A literary Cher, if you will. He's not bound to any formula or genre, and can do as he damn well pleases. His latest novel, Joyland, was marketed as a crime/suspense story rather than one of his sprawling supernatural epics. Everything from the title to the yellow \\"Hard Case Crime\\" tag on the spine to the (wonderful) pulpy cover art implies that this is going to be a brisk and gritty tale of action and violence. I was looking forward to diving in and having some good escapist fun for a couple of days.<br /><br />  It's a testament to Mr. King's abilities that, even after all these years, he still manages to come out of nowhere and surprise me. All the assumptions about the book proved to be something of a misdirect. Yes, the book is a good time -- \\"We sell fun\\", the owner of the Joyland park states throughout the novel, and it's true -- but it is so much more. Joyland may owe more to Ray Bradbury than it does to Dashiell Hammett, and nobody pulls off this awkward sounding literary mashup better than King.<br /><br />  Joyland -- one of the last of the dying breed of classic American amusement parks -- and its venerated place on the Mid Atlantic coast works as a setting on all levels. The park is populated with a lot of the expected players -- the fortune teller, the grizzled carnies, the goofy best friend, the gruff woman with a boarding house -- but all of these people are fleshed out with enough individual quirks and details that they never feel like stock characters, and the park reads stronger and more believably because of it. It feels very much like a real place.<br /><br />  A tale told through the lens of nostalgia by Devin Jones, an aging narrator looking back on the defining summer of his life, King manages to perfectly capture the bittersweet feelings that are inherent in any recollections of one's lost youth. It is beautiful, it is sad, and if one gets the sense that the book ended up more introspective and quiet than King may have originally intended, it is a stronger and more nuanced novel because of it. The action and suspense are there, but the majority of the book is comprised of the very calm, almost mundane observations of a young man crossing the line into adulthood. This is more -- and I usually hate this phrase -- a coming of age story than a crime story. And if Devin seems like an obvious stand in for King (he's tall and lanky, has literary aspirations, works terrible and menial jobs, and reads Tolkien) he's likeable and endearing enough to have it be okay. These pages include some of King's most powerful descriptive writing, reminding us that it's not necessarily his monsters and nightmares that have made so many of us fall in love with him, and he's often at his best when discussing the every-day. The changeable, transitory nature of amusement parks, coupled with the change from summer to fall as symbols of a man's journey into adulthood are never heavy handed, and I admire King's use of restraint here (he is sometimes... a bit much, as those who love his work will admit). We are there on the boardwalk with him, and there is an earnestness to this novel, a charming lack of cynical modernism, that surprised me. It combines the best bits of that sort of mid-20th century storytelling with the sharper and more self aware insights of the current day. This is a small book with a big punch -- in short, Joyland is an absolute joy.<br /><br />  The novel's main weakness is, surprisingly, its murder mystery plot -- though I think it may be more accurate to call it a subplot. It's present throughout the course of the story, but I didn't find myself caring much about it until the last few pages, and it almost seemed as if Mr. King, having lost himself in memory and recollection listening to the waves crash against the shore of this beautifulplace he created in his mind, remembered at the last minute that he had a plot to wrap up and a novel to send off to the publishers. It doesn't mar the experience, it just feels like it could have been fleshed out a little more, or possibly have been fixed as an issue of pacing.<br /><br />  Fans of Stephen King should obviously buy this immediately, but I think it may also appeal to those who have been turned off by some of his sloppier, bigger books of the Dreamcatcher variety. It will most likely not end up as part of the \\"essential\\" King canon or make the top of any of those lists that sites like Buzzfeed seem so fond of, but Joyland is a fun, beautiful, and memorable place to visit that will stick with me for many years, long after the pages are shut and the gates to the park are closed.

B00ECUARO8|5.0|Matthew McConaughey showed up.  I avoided this film because he was in it, but I gave it a chance and I'm glad I did.  The movie is good.  It's 2+ hours long and I never walked away or even paused it.  I read one reviewer say this movie is like reading a novel and I agree.  Great characterization across the board.  Some are barely on screen but they all get a nice little twist, a nice moment, to reveal themselves.  Real good.<br /><br />Edit:  I read the 1-star reviews because I was just wondering what the heck were they thinking.  I have to say they must've not been in the mood for a dramatic picture. They probably should've watched something like \\"Space Pirates Hangover\\"!  This film is pulling 98% on Rotten Tomatoes.  Ignore the 1-stars.

B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I love the movie. It gave me laughs and fun to talk about. It has a lot of great quotes that last along time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game kept me busy and challenged me but definitely needed more levels.<br />They did get a little more difficult as the levels progressed but not enough to stump me.
B000NQRE9Q|1.0|I'm a stickler for video quality.  What I noticed on the first disc \\"Raider's of the Lost Ark\\"; the transfer is not a very good one.  Blu Ray usually looks crisp and though it's a film transfer, here they failed big time.  There are times when there background looks out of focus and I'm not talking cool film out of focus, it's out of focus due to the transfer.  I have these on dvd and I would venture that the DVD probably looks clearer then some of the weird focus issues with this transfer.  Also, even in the clear picture frames, it's not as clean looking, this goes beyond the Film clarity, so something is definitely wrong here.<br />I'd wait for the next clean up of these movies.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This is the book for any woman, whether she is single, married, a mother or a career woman.<br />This will give everyone a chuckle and realize bottom line, we are all so similar and have our quirks and foibles.<br />Angst, worry, insecurity, over confidence this is all a woman's lot.  Then add men and work to the mix.<br />Hey look over your shoulder Mrs. Lot, there is another lady who thinks she left the iron plugged in.<br /><br />Love this book!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book was an interesting, fast read,  I felt for all the main characters.  Will's plight was heartbreaking.  It made me understand more what someone in his position goes through.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I liked the post nuclear devestation beautiful CGI and landscapes.  Strong on action and relationships.  Especially the mystery woman in his dreams.  Morgan Freeman was great.  Cloning make up an interesting twist at the crucial time and later towards the end.  Plot believeable.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I first read this book in 2011, when a friend and fellow bookworm recommended it to me. But today, August 14th 2013, I have finished re-reading it. I wanted to re-read it before the movie comes out and I see it. Of course, I loved it, just as I did the first time.<br /><br />Clary and Simon go to Pandemonium, a popular club for teens one night and Clary see's a blue-haired boy about to be killed. And the best part? No one else can see these people. Next thing she knows, Clary's mother disappears and Clary is attacked by a demon intent on eating her. Clary teams up with the Shadowhunters--Jace, Isabelle, and Alec to find her mother.<br /><br />That was a crappy description that doesn't do the story justice at all, but I'm awake too early to make it sound better. Anyways, this story is awesome. I hope the movie sticks to the book, because the book is great.<br /><br />Things I loved about this book: Clary is kind of cute in an 'I'm short like a leprechaun with red hair but I'll kick your ass and burn down the world to save my mom.' I love that Simon gets turned into a rat. That's just so Simon. Jace is arrogant, but cockiness and arrogance can be just as hot as they can be infuriating. I love that this isn't just a werewolf book, or a vampire book, or a magician book, or an angel/demon/neph book; it's an everything book.<br /><br />Thing's I didn't really like: The only thing I can think of is that the book was in third person. I absolutely detest third person, but I love the story so much I don't really care. So I guess it's really just a 'thing' that I don't like, not 'thing's,' plural.<br /><br />The first time I read this was the best, probably because now I know what happens next in the other books, before I had to find out what was to happen and the anticipation made the book that much sweeter. But overall, an awesome book. And if you plan on seeing the movie, and even if you aren't, read the book first. It'll be worth it.

B00B4FU6KE|5.0|\\"We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves\\" by Karen Joy Fowler, purchased on Amazon.  This is a candid story told by the author as a grown woman and her recollection of her little sister, a chimpanzee.  They were raised as siblings in the childhood home.  How the separation from her \\"little sister\\" came to have a profound effect on her as well as her brother in their adult lives is spellbinding, gut-wrenching at times, and so very, very sad.  A must-read for those who can handle and thirst for real-life knowledge.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game I have the PC verion and the Xbox 360 verion and ive been playing for 3 years but I do have 1 complaint, amazon released a out dated version. See there is a 0.7.2 update out but this one is 0.7.1 so the servers are not available because of that. I have a n Android so I mine aswell buy this game on the play store. (androids ap store) Amazon if you are reading this please update the game to the current verion 0.7.2 please. I dont want to pay another 6.99 dollars on this game again. Although this game is great!

B00C5WR6JE|1.0|One of the biggest disappointments in my musical life. Flat & melodically uninspiring. Sort of like Mogodon on a rainy day looking through a window covered in condensation.Bill's whimsical Beauty has depth and filigree. This is just whimsical melancholy.Don't go there if you are prone to depression.
B008JFUN6E|1.0|I recently saw this film and was extremely disappointed. This could have been a good movie if not for the overriding political push.  The special effects were interesting and the acting was acceptable. The movie is nothing but an ongoing political message about immigration reform and universal heath care. Previous post have very adequately described the movie plot, but to summarize-  Evil, rich white people have created a utopia in outer space when they are healed any illness (including cancer).  Everyone else must live in a slum type environment in LA, where everyone, including Matt Damon, speaks spanish.  The ex-con teams up with an organized crime boss (Spider) to break into Elysium. If you are interested in science fiction, there are much better movies on the market.

030758836X|1.0|I expected to like this book because so many of my girl friends have recommended it.  But I really did hate it!  I think it's poorly written and the dialogue is exaggerated and unrealistic.  I brought it with me on vacation and ended up leaving it in our hotel's library because I don't want it on my bookshelf.  It actually made me mad.  But clearly I'm in the minority.

B004Q7DQLS|3.0|This is a pretty good paranormal story and decent start to a series. The characters were a bit unusual (not cookie-cutter, even for this genre) and the whole dragon thing was different. The writing is decent and I felt the story flowed pretty well. This story only flirted a little bit with cliche', but was by no means burdened with it. Any traces of cliche' are mainly found in Dragos' character, with the whole Alpha-male Paranormal supreme-being type of thing. All things considered, I liked the characters pretty well. I was entertained by the story, though some of the dialogue and the ways the characters related to each other did not keep me completely connected to them throughout the entire story. Some of the dialogue and interaction seemed a bit like people on a reality-tv show to me, and that's not really my favorite. Just my opinion. The narration was good. Overall a worthwhile listen, engaging enough that I would continue on with the series.
B00454U1NS|5.0|Anyone who is a PINK fan or for those looking to discover her music you will not be disappointed with this collection ...SO FAR.<br /><br />It covers a great span of time with plenty of hits.  Can't stop playing it.

B005I6EU7U|4.0|I got the Verso Prologue for my Sony E-Reader. The price tag was a bit more than what I wanted to spend but the idea of a getting a cover that looks like a leather bound book was too enticing to pass up.<br /><br />The cover arrived on time and in good condition. I was worried that the cover would not fit my E-Reader but I am pleased to say that it finds snugly with minimal fuss.<br /><br />Despite the appearance of a leather bound book the cover has a puffed up plastic feeling to it. While I did find this a bit disappointing I can't say I was upset; the cover has excellent grip to stay in place when holding or if set down on a slanted surface and the puffy exterior makes an excellent buffer when I drop the case, which is often. While I wish it did feel like leather I feel this is an worthy trade off. Plus, leather bound covers usually go for two or three times the price of a Verso so you get what you pay for.<br /><br />As stated above, I drop my E-Reader often and I'm very clumsy and prone to destroy things inadvertently (I purchased an E-Reader specifically so I would not ruin another book). I've had this cover for over 4 months and the and it's stayed in remarkable shape despite my daily use and clumsy nature. The design on the front is still in perfect condition and the spine has no sign of wear. I did notice a little bit of fraying but take that with a grain of salt.<br /><br />My only real gripe is how plan it is. The cover is just a simple design with no ability to stand a device up or a place to put a stylus. I would buy another Verso Prologue for my E-Reader in a heart beat but but I would not buy it for a tablet.<br /><br />Move pass the tiny flaws and the missed potential and you'll find the Verso Prologue is amazing in design and style. If you're looking for a for a tablet cover, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a cover that gives the feeling of holding a book, look no further.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|When my Razor finally died (for the second time) I went looking for a new mouse. I saw that this Anker 8000 DPI had good reviews and decided to give it a try. It took a little tuning for the first day or two to get it adjusted but since then it's been working fine for my use. I have to say that the cord is just a little short. And I wish that they included the magnifier in the selection list for the buttons. But those are minor problems.
B009POCG2C|5.0|You would have thought the excellent \\"Gran Torino\\" would have been Clint Eastwood's swansong in front of the camera.  He must have found the script for \\"Trouble with the Curve\\" compelling enough that he had a change of heart.  Like most of the great baseball movies the sport is only a subtext.  The main themes here are family, friends, and loyalty.  Gus Lobel (Eastwood) has been a successful scout for the Braves for decades but he's slipping a little.  Instead of relying on the \\"interweb\\" for evaluating talent he depends on charts and his instincts in evaluating prospects.  There's a high school slugger in Gus' North Carolina territory that the organization is hot on and there is pressure on him to get the kid signed.  Mickey Lobel(Amy Adams) is a successful lawyer about to make partner who is aware of her father's travails.  As a young girl she used to travel with her father on scouting trips and a little of Gus' instincts rubbed off on her.  Despite her better instincts she drops everything to help her father.  Though not necessarily a dysfunctional relationship there is a bit of a disconnect. Mickey still harbors the wounds from being sent to live with relatives by Gus after her mother passed.  Throw in an amiable Red Sox scout (Justin Timberlake) who has as much an eye for the young slugger as for Mickey and you have a terrific dynamic.  As good as Eastwood is he wisely delegates the limelight to his younger co-stars.  John Goodman also turns in a good performance as Gus' friend in the organization.  Matthew Lillard, though, grates playing one of his stock idiots.  I love the atmosphere of this film from the dingy bars to the dinky motels.  I love the smell of the baseball diamonds, the hot dogs with mustard, and the roasted peanuts.  I love this movie.  I watched it with my ten year old nephew and he loved it, too.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said before or shown by the Emmy's won.  Very intense, well acted, great writing.  Taking it in small doses (a couple episodes at a time) and always watch something light and funny in between.
0345803485|4.0|No doubt the series is a worthy purchase and one that you simply just cannot put down....however, if you ever read Walter Mosley's \\"Killing Johnny Fry\\" I think that half of the reviews would have to rewritten.

B0084HJE0S|3.0|I was looking for something that teaches HTML and this is more an explanation of how HTML5 came about and how it compares to other versions for web design.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game has different types of games to play inside the mystery story that you get to be a part of.  I have never played a game like this before, it's been fun.
B000I62JAK|1.0|I chose this rating because it's possibly one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen.  And I don't mean &#34;dumb&#34; in a funny way.  I am sorry I wasted my money on it.  It absolutely does not deserve 4 stars as listed in the ad.  Ben Stiller's voice was stupid and added nothing to the character, in my opinion.  The very beginning did not pull me in, but I continued watching because I had already invested the money.  I'm sorry I wasted my time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it!! the game is awesome!!  I really suggest this game of u like temple run or subwaysurfers its just like those except better
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like the game. It's easy but challenge enough for me want to play some more. It's definitely tries and errors game in every level.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I loved this book. Even though it is simple, I feel that it is thought provoking and inspires you to think about your dreams and the true meaning of life. About how fulfilling it is to follow your desires all the while living a life that is full of the things that bring you joy. It's easy to get caught up. And it's funny how after so many years this is still quite relevant, and it will be for centuries to come.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Works well. I like it for when I am waiting for an appointment or other times when I have time to kill.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I hate the non- conclusion ending.  It feels like the end of a chapter rather than the end of a book.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This extraordinary book has been reviewed so much I have little to add. I only want to say that the chapter where Kvothe meets Skarpi, hears him tell the tale of Lanre and Skelitos, and then talks to Skarpi about it, has left an image I will gladly never forget. Fabulous!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|After the Kite Runner it would take a lot to equal it.  This book is better than his second one.  However, the first part of this book was by far and away far better than the second half of the b ooh.  The last chapter just did not seem necessary.  The first half of the book is well worth the cost of the book.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I've used this app on my Kindle Fire 7&quot; and now on my Kindle Fire HD tablet. Originally it stopped working; the alarms would randomly not sound. Then that was fixed. Now alarms volumes are set individually... which I see a purpose for that, but I can't silence all of them at once if I want to go somewhere without my Kindle screaming at me. And the new design with the big stop/snooze buttons seemed fancy but they DO NOT work right. I have to touch the stop button several times before the alarm stops, and sometimes the alarm goes off again anyway as if it was snoozed. Sometimes it goes off again at random... like 40 minutes later when I told it to stop the alarm.<br /><br />I am REALLY frustrated because I loved this app. I loved how I could set different sounds for each alarm, and it looked so slick. But it's such a pain now and constantly goes off and won't work right. So unfortunately, after dealing with this for quite a few weeks since the interface upgrade with the fancy buttons... I'm uninstalling it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love my horse. Kept me busy while healing. Wish the game had more levels or competitions. &amp; more things to buy with coins. Where else could I own a zebra &amp; a unicorn!!!
B008220C38|4.0|I haven't read Anna Karenina, though I plan to.  I cannot say how accurately this film depicts the novel because of this.  What I do know is that the director wanted to do something different, and therefore it is possible that he put a different spin on things than what the original author had intended.  For this reason, I don't think literary purists will like this movie...but then, literary purists probably prefer books anyway.<br /><br />The whole movie is set on a stage, which is interesting.  I think it helps take the &#34;edge&#34; off the movie.  Russian literature can be very heavy and depressing, and this format lightens the mood and makes it less painful.  However, because it is done on a stage, it also has the characteristics of a play that may cause some objections.  One thing I find about plays is that they tend to simplify things.  There are not deep conflicts about the characters that are delved into.  A person is cast as either a hero(ine), extra, or villain.  You are supposed to root for the good guys and hiss at the bad ones.<br /><br />I definitely got the feeling that either the screenwriter or the director probably had some experience with a cheating lover.  I feel that this movie is very unsympathetic to Anna.  For this reason, though, it is probably a great movie to watch if you get dumped.  I can picture sitting on the couch, eating ice cream, crying, and cheering when that selfish broad gets hit by a train...picturing whoever has hurt you being in her place.  I don't know about you guys, but I regretted Vronsky didn't also get it.<br /><br />Kiera Knightley played this well, though she didn't really make Anna sympathetic.  Knightley has a certain crudity that makes her wonderful as the girlfriend of a pirate, but not as acceptable as the wife of a respected Russian minister.  However, the age difference between Anna and her husband is more definite in this movie compared to some of the others.  Anna seems very young and rather immature, and though she is not sympathetic exactly, the audience may understand her motivations better.<br /><br />I got this movie mainly because of Jude Law.  I'm not usually a big fan of his, and I'm not a big fan of Anna Karenina...but I really liked him in this film.  I don't know if his part isn't larger compared to some of the other movies.  The director did seem to want to focus more on Alexei Karenin--and how his emotional turmoil makes him unfold as the story goes on.  Though Karenin is generally a character you feel sorry for, there are some things about him that makes you understand why his wife may cheat on him.  The age difference, the fact that he seems too busy for his family, his general uptightness, and his sometimes rather creepy stalking behavior...yes, you can perhaps understand. [SPOILER COMING UP HERE: And if you are wondering, yes, that is a condom in that little glass case.  I watched the movie two times trying to figure that out.  I thought it was an eyeglass holder, but it looked rather strange.  I finally had to google it.  I didn't even know they had condoms then.  Then I got a little grossed out.]<br /><br />Vronsky creeped me out.  I didn't really like the actor that played him.  The only problem is, I don't know what Vronsky is supposed to be.  The character struck me as being rather predatory, an untalented man who always wants what he can't have...particularly if it belongs to a man more successful than himself.  He also struck me as someone who has mommy issues and inwardly hates women, and he takes pleasure in humiliating and destroying women because of it.<br /><br />The characters you will root for without any problem are Konstantin and Kitty--the two truly pure people.  My favorite scene is where they use a block game to discuss their feelings for each other.<br /><br />Though the film summarizes everything, I think it does essentially highlight what seems to be Tolstoy's point--the many faces of love.  There is the dutiful love representedby Karenin, who is interested not exactly in passion but what endures...what you build a family on.  There is the worshiping love of Countess Lydia that seems slightly mixed with religious feelings.  There is the obsessive love of Count Vronsky and Anna, which leads to at least her self-destruction.  There is the devotion of a broken creature like the one that cares for Konstantin's brother.  There are many examples.by Karenin, who is interested not exactly in passion but what endures...what you build a family on.

B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I'm not saying this isn't a good book...It's just not for me. It's pretty out there and filled with make believe and vague talk about spooky things without ever explaining what it is the people are talking about. But in all fairness I've never read anything by the author or know what I was getting into. It struck me as more a tween novel as opposed to a suspense and horror novel as I thought it would be. Oh well, it still occupied my plane ride to Hawaii.

B0054R6BFM|4.0|I started reading this book in the early evening - and I stayed up most of the night to finish it.  I couldn't put it down.  I just had to know what happened.  I thought the book had a really interesting concept.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is a great brain thinker and will help kids think more where things should go and how it should be done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a re read for me and enjoyed it as much the second time around. Good for adults and kids
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game and great at testing your reflexes. The story behind this game is you took an idol from a temple and now demon monkeys are now chasing you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Some books never loose their appeal no matter how many times you read them. This series is one of those series
B004VMUS9G|1.0|this alarm clock doesn't even work and there's no ring when you set it and i didn't know how to make it work.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a re read for me and enjoyed as much the second time around well written and good for young and old
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an extremely fun game in which you can do anything.It is an infinite world with blocks that you can use to build things.Craft weapons, food,armor, doors... anything.Build houses,tunnels, etc.Choose survival or creative mode, fight the bad guys, and try to survive and find shelter.That is why this is my favorite game ;). Good luck with this game, hope you enjoy.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Others have summed up the features nicely, I just wanted to add another 5 stars. This app even recognizes my sloppy writing. Another reviewer said that this was impressively addicting, I couldn't sum it up better myself.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|It good game I would have give it 5 stars but it need to update when the phone update come to the phone
0425267695|4.0|Was pleasantly surprised by this book. The main character is interesting as are the supporting characters and the story itself. Only gave it 4 stars because I feel more events could have been included as there is some time passage in the book, would have liked more story I suppose but it didn't truly hurt this excellent book.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It twists and turns your mind. It's fun to have puzzle game to keep your<br />mind flowing. Entertainment by puzzling the brain!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|A very well written book - the characters are we'll defined and they speak as one would expect - in the language of youth.  Very good basis for a story & excellent introduction into history.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My favorite game to play I'm on 24/7  wish I could play all of them at the same time but only one can win
B00A23MYCC|3.0|The movie is fantastic!  However, the digital download version on Amazon is cut apart.  It makes Ted sad.  Seriously.  I'd rather get up and put my BluRay in than keep watching this digital version :(
1451648537|5.0|I have creatd software solutions for many years - including some not so great ones - and I have used Apple products for 20+ years. This book helped me understand the cost and effort required to achieve the level of excellence that we find in many Apple products.
B004XISI4A|5.0|Again George R R Martin write an incredibly piece of literature.  Can't wait for book #6. Winds of Wind of winter
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Great actors, touching story, loved the music (and I'm not even crazy about opera!). Nice escape from violence, gratuitous sex and vapid pop culture. Highly recommend if you have a brain and a heart and enjoy using both. Maggie Smith is a delight.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This I one of the best series I've ever seen.  I ordered Amazon Prime specifically for this show because some of my friends have been raving about. I was addicted since episode one of the first series. I only have a few episodes left of season 3 and I'm trying o savor it.
B0057UA4FY|4.0|I purchased this for my 7 year-old, who is a big fan of the Star Wars movies, and he has been very happy with the series. It takes the best aspects of the movies, and adds more background into Anakin Skywalker' s life as a Jedi. Looking forward to getting season 2.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing. Easy for the whole family and loads of fun. It is making my boring life fun..
B004LLDN3A|5.0|It is a delight! My granddaughter who is 7 loved it! 3 generations of our family connected over our joy watching it, again!<br />It such a spirit lifter!
B00003CXBK|5.0|It is an eye opening animation with great characters and a beautiful story.  Would not recommend to young children because there is some gore. This is better suited for older kids +.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Just put this on my new kindle.  My wife likes the look and sound that this device makes.  This is easy to use, and the color is great.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I am absolutely in love with Hayao Miyazaki films, and Spirited Away is my favorite! It is like something from a dream! Would definitely recommend for all ages!
0062238310|5.0|This is a good book for any Downton Abbey fan.<br /><br />When you are reading it, it's like your right there in the scene with them.<br /><br />Julian Fellowes also has little &#34;experts&#34; on the characters, after some of the scenes.<br /><br />There is also some pictures in the middle of the book.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I always liked playing tri peaks solitaire on Pogo, so this is fun. The only thing I don't like is that they want you to purchase items to make the game easier. I don't plan on doing that. If I don't get 3 stars in every course that's okay. It is still fun to play.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great app, I love to take pictures and try to edit them. So this app really helps me out. I love this app totally worth your money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My three year old son loves this game! It keeps him busy for a long white, which is hard to do with a three year old!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We are very picky with what we allow our children to see and after reading the reviews, we decided to give this one a try.  It was GREAT!!  There is a little bit of bathroom humor, but nothing crude or inappropriate like what's in most &#34;children's&#34; movies today.  I definitely recommend it!
B003SNJYSK|4.0|This is the first in the English translations of the Harry Hole series. It is a fascinating read and I recommend the books. Harry Hole is an interesting hero for a detective series. I don't know whether he needs a &#34;bomb&#34; under him or a make over.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Firefly is a good show and movie this is a good game so play it now and then rate this also
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book th  first-time I read it and loved it even more the second time. A good read no matter how many times your read it.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This is a fun game to kill time and not really think.  easy to use and learn, a good time waster.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is one of the great  classics.  A must read for everyone of all ages.  A typical Mark Twain novel.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is a good relaxer for me. So far I haven't had any problems with it. It is a fun type game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|In Despicable Me: Minion Rush you collect bananas and find and defeat Vector, Meena, and El Macho lots of times. Love it!
B0000067L3|5.0|Who was shaping the course of music back in 1967, 1968?  OK, Beatles, Stones, San Francisco, LA?  Well, make room for Cream.  Musical virtuosity coupled with intelligent  innovation.  Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce both went onto make continued great music.  The thing is that Eric Clapton only really sounded great when he was just the guitarist.  As a leader, in my opinion, he faded a little.  But couple him with another music personality (Duane Allman, Steve Winwood, Delaney and Bonnie) and you get guitar god making music that lasts.  No coincidence that Tom Dowd was present here.<br />Tom Dowd engineered or produced some of the most influential albums of the late 60's and early 70's.  Plus the remastered series includes the second disc of live music from the Fillmore East.  This was/is good music.  This record has lasted.  Play it again Sam.  Johnny P
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Few books of this length deserve to be of this length. It more often then not is a warning of overly repetitious detail. This story utilized every bit of the detail it gave keeping you in a state of suspense throughout. It was well paced with several chapters, both early and late, giving off a climatic feeling. With so much material I feared that it may lack a solid ending, but I was proven wrong there as well. The characters were so well understood and easy to care about that the end for each of them felt perfect. Not to mention, the multiple points of view each gave important pieces to the long term story and the end did a glorious job at making them all into one big piece.<br />I would recommend this to fans of fantasy who enjoy the ruled experience that can only be achieved by a well established world in terms of its magical systems and culture. There is never a point that something happens and you find yourself questioning the plausibility within the realm Sanderson created.<br />Excited to move on to the next title and disappointed  it took this long for me to get to this one.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Eric Clapton was only great when he was just the guitarist in a band.  As a leader, in my opinion, he faded a little, but couple him with Steve Winwood(Blind Faith), Duane Allman(Derek/Dominos) , or Jack Bruce(Cream) and you get guitar giant.  That's what you have here with Cream's reunion concert album.  Its a double cd with memorable, worthy music that may always last, AND mainly because Eric was just part of the band.  This is definately not meant as an insult to Eric.  Jack Bruce was one of Eric Clapton's early foils and he succeded in challenging the young guitarist and the older more mature one too.  Classic music still being made.  Johnny P
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I wanted to see them all over again because it's great and it keeps you guessing even though I have seen them all
B000059T1E|5.0|This was a GREAT record when it came out, and it still is.  Their second album, &#34;Traffic&#34; was very good, BUT the first truly GREAT Traffic album is Barleycorn.  Dave Mason had finally made up his mind and left the group for good.  Winwood, Capaldi, and Wood came back together and made the monster, John Barleycorn Must Die.  The earlier music,  in my opinion, was far more &#34;experimental&#34; during the flower power late 60's.  There was much good music there, but on Barleycorn, Traffic focused on Rhythym and Blues AND Folk Rock too.  To me, this is Traffic.  This album and then Low Spark,  and Shootout.  Smart music.  One of the greatest records of the early 70's. Thanks.  Johnny P
B0037VIBGY|5.0|Excellent film. Tom Hardy one hell of an actor. Very entertaining. Glad I bought it. I'll definitely watch it again.
B00COO2D6O|4.0|I can definitely kill a lot of time playing this game. And it is fun, there are just a pros and cons I saw.<br /><br />Pro<br />Simple<br />Fun<br /><br />Cons<br />You are going to have to spend more money to advance in this game at least 4.99
B00A1AD6ZU|4.0|I was delighted to be introduced to James Rollins' Sigma novels.  His combination of history, myth, contemporary science  into gripping adventure is remarkable. His researched details in each of these fields gives an unusual texture but whichnever slows down the fast-paced action. I ordered three more Sigma novels.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I knew i was a long shot to buy yet ANOTHER temple run game. I find that it gets boring after the first few minutes.....oh wait, those preascious minutes were wasted LOADING  A GAME I DIDNT LIKE. Just get temple run one and two. And Gameloft could you please stop making such time consuming and money wasting games? i sure am glad this was free. Some people may like it but it works horible on my kindle fire and freezed it. A huge let down....
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|I absolutely love this song.  Reminds me of Bowie, who is an influence of Lady Gaga.  It is a great dance song.  And I also love the lyrics.  Lady Gaga doesn't get credit for her artistry, which is a shame.  I cannot wait for \\"ARTPOP\\" to be releaased.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|History and romance all in one book written as a result of a lot's of investigation. Giving to the reader an insight of the second world war from various view points..
B004LPLU4K|4.0|Well done!  We loved the production, cast and story line.  We plan to recommend it to others as soon as possible.
B005GET42K|4.0|Interesting for those working in translation, any language. Up to now I've only read a 30% of it. It is good.<br />Maria Cristina
B00005J6UP|5.0|Hands Down. If you're a parent that thinks the language is vulgar, you're shutting your eyes and missing all the creativity and excitement that helps children develop their imagination and build character. Goonies never say die!
B00A6L78TY|5.0|If you are a fan of 60s music (which you are if you're reading the reviews) you will enjoy this album. So go buy it!...NOW!.... or whatever.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|Don't watch it with English Dubbing unless you're deaf or dumb (can't read dumb, not cannot speak dumb). It was recorded in French, with French actors for a reason. One of the best movies I've ever seen. Very artistic, colorful, and thoughtfully shot. Every second is a joy to watch.<br /><br />YAYYYY!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|You are Irene the sister of Anne and you want to be a Jr councillor. However someone stole the magic book. So you go out and use your gifts to find the person. The graphics are nice, voice characters annoy me ( why because the voice don't match the mouth movement) and skip button works well on mini games. Hey! This was a free app day app! So glad was free.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|A kindle read and read last of all &#34;Hole&#34; series.  Would have been better if I read it first, but it was unavailable on Kindle until recently.  Okay, somewhat &#34;stretchy&#34; abilities for detective, but what detective novel isn't?
0345529057|5.0|I am currently on the third book, and I have loved all of them! They are very well written, and the world is very complex and intriguing.  Can't wait for more!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I'm an extrovert and this book was very helpful to me in understanding how the mind of an introvert operates. I hope to be more sensitive to introverts in the future. And I hope that my book club will agree to read this with me! Lots of things to discuss!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|We actually didn't finish this show.  Couldn't get interested in it all, and we never chose to finish it. Couldn't recommend.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|now if you are a die hard iron man fan this is the game for you.Now if you are not a<br />fan will DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!! I loved playing this game
B00COHAUD4|3.0|I think I was expecting more out of this movie but it was still worth watching I would give a 3 1/2 if amazon would allow
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|This book is awesome and very detailed. I little gruesome though I recommend I  to dog lovers such a  myself.  I clearly demonstrates how word usage has changed over the years.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I am a fan of these types of syfi movies it really kept me going till the end I would recommend it
B000002LAC|5.0|I love all three singers. They are great performers who together made an incredible sound. The song selection was just<br />beautiful. the best harmony ever.
B008VBYN80|3.0|you get what you pay for.  if you spend a little money you can make progress otherwise this can be frustrating
B009GX69RK|5.0|Several friends had recommended New Girl to me so I watched my first episode a few days ago. From the pilot I was hooked. I finished Seasons 1 and 2 in only 3 days. Highly recommend!!! I think I belly laughed at least once per episode and regular laughed constantly.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Well one hidden object game. To creepy for small children, but fine for teens. Really liked the map feature that showed when you were done with an area.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game pegs out the old Fun-o-Meter! I have played a lot of electronic Uno games but this one is by far the best. It is graphically dazzling and the gameplay is fluid and fun. Things move along smoothly and enforcement of classic rules keeps the game fun and interesting. The whole scratch ticket concept for free tokens is very nice. 2 Thumbs Up!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I've bought two copies of this DVD:  one to keep and one to give as a gift.  The cast, story, music and especially the photography provide a charming, delightful film that I watch over and over again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|we really enjoy playing this game together.  It is pretty engaging and offers lots of opportunities to advance without spending any extra money.  This is nice considering most games that are free sucker you in to buying gems.
B00DDZM0GQ|1.0|very difficult and confusing to use doeas not explain clear enogh to use or maybe did not work on my kindle
B00B5AIB50|5.0|I have seen a number of documentaries on Karajan....but this one held my interest the most.  It shows him fully engaged in an impossible quest to attain his artistic vision in the recording studio.  He was a complex and demanding taskmaster, not especially sensitive in the area of interpersonal relations (Aspergers?), a deficit which he admits and ultimately a tragic figure despite his many  achievements.  The interview with Karajan filmed not long before his death comes as quite a shock, his aged drained appearance quite different than a few years earlier and his rather dismissive opinion of his recorded legacy with his Berlin orchestra not really something I expected.  When I saw Karajan conduct Heldenleben on one of his last North American tours, he was barely able to make it to the podium where he sat as he conducted.  On the final chord he expanded his arms straight out to the side and the Berlin Philharmonic produced a sound that I had never heard before in the concert hall.  It was not of this world. It felt as though he would simply levitate and soar upwards.  I'm a Furtwangler man so this transforming experience was not something I really expected, given the reputation that Karajan had in many circles of being technically accomplished but too self-involved and superficial.  Thus began my serious reconsideration of Karajan's place in the pantheon of great recreative artists.  This documentary contributes a great deal to this discussion and will be of interest to those who are fascinated by this larger than life conductor.
B00005JKDR|5.0|the movie was still wrapped, completely new, my kids are watching it right now, i thought we had not recieved it since i had not seen it and my husband claimed he hadnt either, when it was actually already out of the shipping package and sitting UNDER a pile of things he leaves laying around, i feel horrible that i left bad seller feedback because of this when it was another IDIOCY STRIKES AGAIN case, i really didnt know we had the movie already n now theres no way for me to change it but i emailed the seller with a long apology, this seller deserves her 5 stars and i will be contacting amazon to try to correct my mistsake and get her the 5 star rating, i love this movie and im very glad i get to share it with my kids now and start a nice collection for them like every child should have. very good price for a very worthy item! ;)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey, except for when they broke my heart and killed off Matthew! That wasn't fair right after his son was born.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great game with endless hours of entertainment! Perfect to pass the time while waiting at the airport!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|If your interested in a good action sci fi movie, avoid this one. All of the action is in the trailer
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|this is a great game and very fun to play, but a few things you might not like...first of all you have to download new updates pretty much every week and it wont let you play without it which is a waste of time.but over all this is a fun game.thanks for your time!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The editing itself is great. In a few moments my OK photo was a piece of art. It looked like it was saving although it never actually said saved and after several tries the photo never did save. I think this is an app that the creator abandoned. Could have been very good too.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Denzel delivers a great performance as a pilot addicted to alcohol and drugs.  Great movie..John Goodman is hilarious and a believable character.
B001HC8516|4.0|Very Insightful read. Both women as well as men will benefit from the book there is a similar book out which goes in depth into the minds of men great novel: [[ASIN:B00E8X2M6A The Truth: A Man's Perspective On Relationships & Women (1)]]
B0094BB4TW|4.0|On kindle can't play my games =/. Can you down load anything on Kindle Fire, so I can play the games I like?
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very moving. Lovely story. First Moyes bookI read.  Beautiful writing. Will look into other books. Before this story, only Pat Conroy had made me cry.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I use to play this game back when I was younger. I'm still not good at it though lol. My nince and nephew like to play though
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|Movie was bad, so bad. There wasn't much of a plot. I actually demanded we turn the movie off because it was so bad. The movie wasn't scary but rather just a gore-fest. Bad, bad, bad. Terrible!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app it's best running frame thank you so much.for this app I love this app I recommend this app
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I play this game all the time I just wish they would put videos to get more gold coins that s of be awsome
B000P407K4|5.0|It's good. Watch it and chances are you'll agree.<br /><br />Eleven more words required. Now only seven. And now only four.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|This is no Academy Award winner but very entertaining! Nice way to spend some time. Would recommend it for easy watching.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|I have to say, I was never a big fan of the concept that this movie was based on, but the final product is better than the premise would have you believe.  It's hardly perfect, but it's more than worth watching and has some great moments.<br /><br />The good:<br />- The humor is great; pretty much all the scenes of Twilight trying to adjust to life in the human world are hilarious, and all of the character humor that the original show is so good at is there in full force.<br />- All of the existing characters are carried over into the movie very well; they definitely still feel like themselves<br />- The attention to detail: there's always something interesting going on in the background; most of the famous background ponies show up, and it goes to show that the writers were actively trying to make a quality product.<br /><br />The average:<br />- The songs are catchy, but I don't think they're as good as the ones from the show itself.<br />- The plot is interesting in theory, but not all the potential gets used and most of the story is a fairly banal high school drama type thing (until the end, which is epic).<br />- The animation is definitely good, but the character designs are a bit off (the characters are all too skinny and the heads are too big in proportion to their bodies) and it knocks things down a bit.<br /><br />The not-so-good:<br />- The movie's new characters are a bit lackluster.  Sunset Shimmer has an interesting backstory (Celestia's previous apprentice who fails and ran away to another world), but that largely gets passed over in favor of treating her as just a typical popular girl who's a jerk.  Flash Sentry has even less going for him; he's just sort of a generic \\"cute guy\\" character who contributes so little to the plot that he might as well not be there.<br /><br />Overall, the main plot is a bit shaky and typical at places, but the cast is strong enough to make it perfectly watchable.  Not quite the MLP movie I was hoping for, but it's stilla very fun watch.
1451673442|5.0|I just got this book after reading about 'the Secret' and seeing a program about it on television.  The book is terrific and I'm truly glad that I got it.  I'm still reading it but I consider it one of the best books that I've ever purchased . . .
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This is a cute movie about real problems that is done well. It doesn't ignore the reality of mental illness, but it also allows for happiness.
B00095NX9G|5.0|This is a great workout and wonderful experience.  Quick delivery and everything is very detailed and to the point.  the yoga workout is wonderful!
B008KOTNVA|5.0|The quality is top notch on these.  Much better than the ones you can buy in hardware stores.  It is magnetic for picking up and holding on to screws.  It has a bit for everything.  I used them on Xbox 360's, Nintendo's, iPhone's, Android's.  I've even used them in my cordless drill with the included attachment.  I had it on a low setting and no damage was done to the bits.  I absolutely recommend these to any tinkerer or fixer.
0307740919|5.0|This is a good read. It is a short book, but filled with the Toni Morrison's flavor.<br />There is still that element of mystery, but without confusion.<br />As always her writing opens the mind to think.<br />I like where Ms. Morrison is going with her writing.
B00514HDNW|5.0|This book is rad. Well imagined, well executed and end rocks. Seriously compelling until the last words. I am legend!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Received my Chromecast today. 5 minutes later, it is hooked up to my television via the HDMI and USB ports, and it works like a charm. Power supply was not needed since the HDMI/USB ports power it. Will be happy when more Apps are available to use through it but for now, it works great and that is why I purchased it. So easy to hook up anyone can do it quickly.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|If you go into the movie knowing what to expect, you will like it. A movie about action and it delivers on that aspect.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|awesome game but some of the prices for shops and ponies are outrageous I think hasbro needs to lower the price big time otherwise it is a great game
B005Y0OFVG|5.0|Georgette Heyer is one of my favourite authors. This one did not disappoint me.I definitely will be finding more of her's to purchase.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|When I don't have an internet connection, I love having the kindle app on my phone and Samsung tablet. I have read many books on with the app and I plan to read many more. The app has some nice features like auto syncing between devices, and you can bookmark pages and passages you like as you read.<br /><br />I would recommend this app to anyone.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think that hill climb racing is awesome. Awesome stunts, awesome cars, awesome everything. Just AWESOME work with the game!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book about 10 years ago when I was in high school. It was a good book then, and an even better book now. Good story, with an interesting message. It is only just over 300 pages, so it is a relatively quick read, perfect for a long car ride or plane. I would recommend this book for those who like sci-fi fiction novels/movies.<br /><br />While this is marketed as more of a kids book, I would not recommend it for anyone under 12-13 years old. There are a lot of graphic scenes in the book that could potentially be very disturbing for an older child/young teen.<br /><br />I would also recommend reading all of the other books in the Ender Quintet. All of them are just as good as this book, and they help fill in some of the holes from Ender's Game.<br /><br />ENJOY!
B00CXQL828|4.0|This is good - the opening track - Elevate - might be the best on the CD...I like it but, I think I'll get tired of it quickly ....it's good for the genre (that being the power rock ballad type stuff that Van Halen an Bon Jovi crank out) .....it just seems a bit too commercial....but it's good...not great..good...I really like the musicians and think Portnoy is one of the best, if not the best drummer going, but I like the stuff he's done with Neal Morse (the cover CDs) much better. This is just so 80's - 90's, that I think it would've been a classic back then.....but now it just sort of sounds....late...but still good
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a great fantasy book that explores a world of magic and necromancy.  The book follows Sabriel, who is thrust into a position she neither wants nor is prepared for, but must accept to find her father and save the Old Kingdom.  \\"Sabriel\\", along with the following books in the series, are some of my favorite books, and I can't wait for the release of \\"Clariel\\".
B00BWJARHO|1.0|this is where we should have started, not LOTR and it doesn't require three movies, this is just a money scheme
B003VANOFY|3.0|The sound quality is good, when it works with my software and games,which is not always. I noticed in some games that some of the channels were dropped completely, leaving me in silence. Also, the mic was picking up noise even when the boom was up, which is supposed to mute it. The software that comes with it doesn't have a huge amount of features, but the voice changing settings are fun to play with, and the programmable buttons on the side come in handy for switching between different settings. The construction was sturdy and it felt comfortable on my head. I would have given it a higher rating if the sound worked with all my software and games, or it was a little cheaper.<br /><br />One other comment for Logitech: why not include an adapter so I can use this with consoles like the X-Box? That would be another star for you!
B002UD56I6|5.0|he was the man what a great loss this video helps you understand his state of mind at the time
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I have recommended this to everyone I know.  I love everything about it.  The filming is so terrific.  It makes New York look so beautiful...I want to go there.  The script is smart and all of the actors are top quality.  You can appreciate the acting of even the characters you don't like.
B004ZJZQHE|5.0|I love sasso's place its got a lot of potential, I think I could make money with that spot. great blu ray.
B00821OX98|4.0|Very good handling of this genre of SF, nice story line, lots of twists and turns, action keeps the show from getting boring - little heavy on the gore
B001DUDKEY|1.0|So bad I fell asleep and I never fall asleep in movies....  the filming was terrible, the acting was worse... there was no chemistry... what is up with the circus?  Someone needs to remake this movie with better actors and actresses directors and film crew.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|This movie made me reconsider my views on the 'enviro-friendliness' of natural gas. If we're to stop global warming, we must stop hydraulic fracturing.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It got just a bit dull last year, but it seems to be picking back up.  Looking forward to the new season.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|The drain plugs are too close to the edges and when  blown up the bottom is stretched tight.  This means the hole for draining is about 1 inch higher than the bottom so you have to work to drain the last bit of water.  Minor issue except kinds track trash in and we have to drain at least every 2 weeks.  We do use swimming pool chemical treatments to keep algae and mosquito larvae at bay, and it holds up well to that.  Fantastic little kid pool.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is really a great series with outstanding actors. It has a VERY good theme which flows smoothly. With Steven Speilberg behind it, need I say more? I thorougly enjoyed EVERY episode. I can't wait to begin season 2.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I had to read this book for my 8th grade language arts class over the summer. It was really boring at first but once I was interested in it I was hooked. So my advice is to keep reading even tough you might fall asleep. I thought it was good but you won't know how you like it until you read it!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Can't save picture &amp; no reply to crust service.<br /><br />This is worthless to use.  I will be uninstalling it. Don't use unless you want a game to play because that is all it can do
0312427999|5.0|If enough people read this book there would be enough people power to transform the world economy so that no one would live in poverty.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|I enjoy all of Nicholas Sparks' books and the movies.  This one has a bit of mystery involved and has a very moving story line.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|Maybe there is a limit on how many Reacher novels you can read before the formula becomes less satisfying. I enjoyed getting to know Jack through the first few novels in the series; his challenges have been inventive, and the local color is always inviting--like taking a trip to rural Colorado, or wherever Reacher's hitch-hiking takes him. I would rate Nothing to Lose at the middle of the pack. Reacher is now (in this book) over 10 years out of the military, and I would like to see him take that one side road that leads to a lasting relationship soon.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|It is gettting a little too bizarre but still like the characters and story.  It is sooo easy to slip down that rabbit hole.  And my hubby is a chemist- very WW in season 1-3-not so much now.  Love it!
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|My husband and I both really enjoyed this movie.  (And that's rare)  It's starts out kinda of like the movie Stand By Me but gets more and more interesting as the movie progresses.  I would watch it again.  Of course, seeing Matthew McConaughey without a shirt on is never a bad thing.  Would definitely recommend to men and women.
B00846REIS|4.0|Comparable to Fifty Shades of Grey.  I read the second book and on the third book of the series now
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the Best keyboard I have ever used. The auto complete feature is so smart that I can just select word by word entire sentences.
B00702NWW4|5.0|As always, Amazon MP3 files are great quality. I can play on all my devices.. Love all the songs. Very pretty.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|This is more for someone new to Kakuro.  (I am a high school math teacher.)  They are fun but predictable in a lot of cases.  *Used on ASUS transformer.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is a good movie and follows the book as closely as it can for the time a movie has to tell a story.  The book, as always was much better.
0385341679|5.0|The cover is a work of art.  The story was so well written and we finally get an author who writes sequels with some length to them!  Thanks for that!
125000098X|5.0|Purchased for wife and she enjoyed  the story. I will be ordering more books by this author as they become available..
B000W91RUG|5.0|Such a fun show.  You need to have the introduction to everyone and then watch as they evolve in upcoming seasons
1250039037|5.0|Bought book for wife and she enjoyed reading it. I will be ordering more books of this catagory as they become available.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|How can you not like this series?  The gang is just getting started and the 2nd season is very funny
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Why would you have a level guide for an app without providing the actual app on that device? This is really stupid.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read the trilogy twice. I just love it. I believe I even like it better than Harry potter.I still cry .this is an awesome read
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Cd is great i am a huge five finger death punch fan have all there music, I also bodybuild and power lift this cd has  really aggressive testerone  raising songs , for the price that it is  a MUST BUY
B009EEFTMC|4.0|The graphics are wonderful and the cube has beautiful images.  However, I find the clock annoying, distracting from the game.  Therefor I would  rate it 4 and a half.  But it is a really fun game.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love this app! I have been through four phones and have been sure to download the app on every single one.  I just got a new phone and when it crashed I lost my kindle app and all of the precious books that I had accumulated on the new phone.  When I tried to download the app again I keep getting an error message.  Seriously?! I am now downloading the nook app as I write.  I feel like I am being disloyal, but what choice do I have?
B00447G2PM|4.0|Bought this as a first 3D movie purchase, and it really makes you feel like you are underwater. Sharks swimming at you and jellyfish floating around, they seem to be right in the room with you. If you like ocean films, rec. buy.
0762439009|5.0|So, I was on here looking for some Lebowski merch (t-shirts, posters, and so on) and I found this. I would really love to order it, but I wanted to know, is there a certain seller anyone has ordered this from that they felt satisfied with? I would really appreciate it if someone could help a fellow achiever out!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a very fun and exciting game to pass the time away. The sounds are really nice and the colors are great
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have not explored this enough to give a review, but the idea really sounds fantastic.  Now I won't have to keep buying different<br />versionsof the Bible.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|My experience of the book was akin to the experiences of its characters - at times calm, reflective and content and at other times confused, troubled and weary. The fundamental elements of the story in the early parts of the novel were moving and evocative and good to read. But I found working through the lives and part lives of all the characters that followed a bit hard going. Maybe I was looking for more from the novel than was eventually delivered. No lasting impressions of Afghanistan that I didn't already have. Kite Runner was more to my liking. In spite of my lukewarm response to this book, I will look out for more works by Khaled Hosseini.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Good show. Lots of action. A great cast of characters. Some of them are looking their age but can still act. Good story line. I don't think I will ever get tired of these actors like Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Jason Statham, Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwartzenegger and others. I enjoyed it. Good entertainment. Lots of violence but, hey consider the cast!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Each chapter keeps you wanting more and thinking of different possibilities for the ending! I couldn't put it down! Awesome!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I will probably read it again.  I skipped ahead a few times. Larsson is a great storyteller. I just love Salander.  Weird chick.
B006LSZECO|5.0|All of her books are amazing! I couldn't put this book down. It is unlike any other mystery novel I have read before.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|American History X is about the idea that prejudice and bigotry will kill our children. The idea is that prejudice is a slippery slope. A father's offhanded racist remark over the dinner can lead to unintended consequences. The result, in the world of this movie, is children killing each other. The movie makes a pretty convincing argument that the consequences in our world would be just as dire, that there is no room for even a little bit of bigotry in our society if we are to survive without killing each other.<br /><br />American History X goes about proving this idea with two main plots: the internal plot of Derek's redemption from being a skinhead Nazi to a tolerant individual actively helping the good cause and the external plot of Derek's attempt to save his younger brother Danny from the brainwashing that ruined him. Derek is successful in redeeming himself, but his attempt to save Danny fails when Danny is shot and killed. This suggests that even if we live with hate in a momentary weakness, that hate will have consequences far beyond the moment. The movie suggests that with hate, there is no such thing as true redemption. Therefore, we are all well-advised to avoid even a little bit of it.<br /><br />The movie makes the idea fully believable because of the depths of hate and true redemption Derek goes through. He seemed to have finally won the battle to save both his family's soul when his past all of a sudden catches up to him and kills Danny. This twist at the end makes it impossible to finish the movie feeling good about ourselves that the hero has won his redemption through his trials by fire. It makes it impossible not to think and feel and believe that hate will eventually catch up to all of us if we let it in for even a little bit. Great idea and a great movie.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|This is a very good product! priceing is very good verses oridginal maufactories one! Keep up the good work guys! I look forward to possibly doing buisness with you all someday,&#34;if needed!'
B00000JLWW|3.0|Titanic is about the idea that love conquers death. It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone. Jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process. Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack. The main plots of their love and Jack's doomed escape from Titanic are supported by additional plots of Hockley's escape from the ship and the treasure hunters search for the diamond.<br /><br />The story's focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death (love endures despite and because of Jack's death). The side plots provide fuel for the main turning points and add the final clincher of Rose remembering her love for decades by throwing away the diamond in memory of Jack. James Cameron really knew what he was doing with the story and it shows in the Story Chart.<br /><br />My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|Love and lust through a man's perspective. This was just awesome. It was different. I loved it! I laughed so hard through almost the entire book and toward the end I did not want to put it down. I just wanted to know what crazy idea this guy was gonna come up with next!!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This was a free app of the day, so the only positive thing I can write is that I didn't spend a dime on it.<br /><br />Any edited picture does not save. It processes like it is saving (takes a few seconds) but it doesn't save. Waste of time!!!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I've been waiting for the update for over 3 weeks and I've got nothing so it's staying one star until the update happens.  =(
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is awesome I love it but what I love the most is that it gives you a bit of a challenge good luck!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's the best game ever nothing can top it.  If you don't have it your stupid. It's awesome so you should get it
1432794426|5.0|Thank you so much,Karen, for a fantastic, well-researched, beautifully written book about a modern day King. You took the time to really understand one of the most misunderstood individuals in modern times. This is one of my favourite MJ books out there, I think it's safe to say that you completely captured the Michael Jackson his fans have observed from afar.<br />Five stars isn't enough!
B00008EUMA|5.0|This re-issue sounds just as good if not better than the original pressing. For under $20, it is a steal. Make sure not to miss buying this before they're all gone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Totally the best book I ever read. Everything happened so quickly that I didn't expect it. Best book I ever read.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book is a true classic.  I must have read it at least a hundred times, but still enjoy reading it even now. It has so much soul. My favorite episode in the book is where Jo almost loses Amy and learns to control her anger. Mrs. March is such a wonderful mother... This book is a must-read for all little women and little men as well. It inspires you to be good.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|It works awesome on my kindle fire! I can edit and make my drawings into memes with this app, which is very cool. But the only problem is Where's the camera roll? It said it saved my pictures in there, and I can't seem to find it.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I originally got this game just to see if my little bro would even play it, but I got interested after a while. He played on hard at night the first time and for a week wouldn't go to bed by himself. It is a pretty scary game. The only thing I can find wrong with it is how it's in black and white and you can't see slender if he's in the shadows, but over all its worth 99 cents.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies that any real movie buff needs in their collection. I have been (impatiiently) waiting for this movie to come out on Blu-ray, and now that it has I am blown away. What has always been able to stand as one of the best cinematographic movies of all time has now turned the corner for the serious home movie watcher.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|This (Jack Reacher) series never fails to entertain.....suspense, a genuine hero, a little sex, some great fights (which the hero usually wins)!  Lee Child has a winning formula!  Love these books!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. I couldn't put it down.  So thrilling and kept me on the edge of  my seat.  Highly recommend.
B00BU3P1NW|5.0|There are well over 100 reviews of this album so I don't need to go into the songs on this offering. What I would like to stress is how much better this is on an SACD player. If you don't know what that is you are missing out on a lot of great music made better by the SACD format. I will go as far as recommending the purchase of an SACD player and the switch to SACD format as soon as you can. More SACDs are being released monthly ( I have pre-ordered Steppinwolf in SACD set to release in September 2013). Not every album is available in this format, but the list is growing fast. Go to Amazon's search bar and type in SACD. You will be glad you did. This album deserves a five star review in any format. If possible to give a ten star rating for the SACD version I would. (hybrid SACDs are also able to be played on standard CD players too, just in a regular CD sound).
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a game that is exciting an fun.I just love it when u almost got caught,it's like ding dong ditching.u don't want to get caught but it's exciting because there looking out and you are hidden
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|PBS found a real winner in this great dramatic series, everyone is wondering what will happen next with all the story lines.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I thought it would be similar to the PC version, but it's not.  You can't seem to get to the weather because of constant pop-ups.  Even though it's free, I wouldn't recommend it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The book is well written and the story is amazing.  It was challenging to understand at times because of the author's knowledge of the brain.  I highly recommend it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story is a MUST read! It has well developed characters and an important life lesson!  You need to make every single day count. Life can change so quickly! Don't doubt your capabilities.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|I was disappointed.  It wasn't like the others at all, when you could root for Bruce Willis and feel good about what his character was doing.  Plus the supporting cast was not much to watch.  Plus the story was lame.  And I get tired of watching one automatic weapon killing 20 people with 10 rounds of ammunition.  I can suspend disbelief only so far!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This progression of the drama gets  more tense. The characters work very well together and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching them evolve.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|I purchased this CD for the few songs I've heard on SiriusXM's Alt Nation.  I enjoy the CD but grew tired of it rather quickly.  The songs all sound the same
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Great story line.  End gets kinda confusing, something that needs to be followed closely.  Netflix is perfect for this series can go back and watch again.
1416585710|2.0|I just can't read it! I've tried numerous times but the made up random words and language out of no were is extremelly distracting making the book hard to follow and uncomfortable to read. Boo!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun, entertaining enough if you like hidden object games. however the story is very confusing.  But it is free and worth the space.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Only been playin for an hour..not sure what I am doin but I like it and haven't had to buy anything..Will rate it again later. Wish I had a clearer view on how this game works. Hard for me to get all the parts right..
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I really love to play uno is fun and reminds me of when I was younger and also think they should make it to where we can buy the coins to pay with our points instead of waiting to scratch the cards but when you do have time and want to play a game that reminds you of the fun you had as a child play uno ...
B000ID37T0|5.0|Top performance by Al Pacino. Loved the scene with the Tango! Supporting cast is excellent. One of my top 5 movies.
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids really enjoy it and its a clean, challenging game. Great how you can play 2 players against each other
B0096BIENY|5.0|I have ALL of the Il Divo CD's, and this is my favorite by far!  First of all, what a bargain!!  To receive 2 CD's at such a reasonable price is an unexpected surprise.  Secondly, the selection of music for this collection is amazing.  The best and favorite recordings from each of their previous CD's were selected for this collection, and it includes a wonderful variety:  songs in English, Spanish, Italian, and French; some holiday recordings, some Christian favorites, some contemporary selections, but mostly, a wonderful mix of romantic love songs.  Truly these four men have the most beautiful voices being recorded today.  I NEVER get tired of listening to this one over and over again!
B0086700CM|5.0|My kids and husband love this game. Keeps them entertained and its clean and fun! Good challenge and hand eye cordination
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found the puzzles challenging enough to be interesting but not so frustrating that I wanted to give up. Can't wait for more levels!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|My 4 year old son likes all the Angry Birds games. This is a cute, fun different Angry Birds. Nice colors
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3UPVLKJ6EBR5R]]\\"Breaking Bad\\" is now over... but it will live on in the hearts and minds of fans.  Fortunately, it will also live on in the blu-ray format - this Complete Series collection is a must own for fans of the show.  I was excited and satisfied by the series finale, but I'm also sad realizing that it's all over.  If you've always watched the show, or if you've just found it recently (I discovered the show on DVD before getting hooked in Summer 2011), you know how great the show is.  If you've never seen \\"Breaking Bad\\", then I encourage you to give it a chance.  Rarely has a show had this much universal acclaim (a 9.4 on IMDb, a 99/100 on Metacritic, 3 Emmy wins for Drama Actor and 4 Nominations for Best Drama Series, etc).<br /><br />*****<br /><br />This complete series blu-ray set comes with the following:<br />- Discs are packaged inside a replica money barrel.<br />- Los Pollos Hermanos apron<br />- Collectible Challenge Coin<br />- Episode Guide Booklet (w/ letter from Vince Gilligan)<br /><br />LIST OF SPECIAL FEATURES<br />- No Half Measures: Creating the Final Season of Breaking Bad - An all-new, exclusive two hour documentary that chronicles the filming of the final eight episodes.<br />- Bad Memories - Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul talk about the show ending and some of their favorite moments.<br />- Bryan Cranston: Director - Go on set with Bryan Cranston as he directs the first episode of the season entitled \\"Blood Money.\\"<br />- Scene Envy - The Cast tell us which scene they wish they could have been in.<br />- Shocking Moments - The stars reveal the moments that shocked them most.<br />- From Walt to Heisenberg - From high school teacher to deadly meth dealer, watch as Walter White quickly transforms into Heisenberg.<br />- How Will It End? - At the beginning of the season, the cast was asked to give their thoughts on how they thought the show would end.<br />- Avenging Agent: Dean Norris as Hank Schrader - A look at the character Hank Schrader and the man who played him, Dean Norris.<br />- Scene Stealer: Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader - A look at the character Marie Schrader and the woman who plays her, Betsy Brandt.<br />- A Criminal Attorney: Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman -A look at the character Saul Goodman and the man who played him, Bob Odenkirk.<br />- Jesse's Journey: Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman - A look at the character Jesse Pinkman and the man who played him, Aaron Paul.<br />- Skyler Breaks Bad: Anna Gunn on Season Four - Actress Anna Gunn and series creator Vince Gilligan explore Skyler's character evolution through the fourth season.<br />- Growing Up in the White House: RJ Mitte on Walter, Jr. - RJ Mitte, Anna Gunn, Bryan Cranston and series creator Vince Gilligan discuss the extraordinary dynamics of the White family, and Walter, Jr.'s unique role.<br />- The Ultimate Chess Match - Members of the cast and crew discuss Walter White and Gus Fring's extraordinary and complicated battle of wits and their struggle for Jesse's allegiance.<br />- Looking Back: A Season Four Retrospective - Season Four's most surprising and memorable moments.<br />- Ted's Wipeout - In Episode 411, \\"Crawl Space,\\" Ted Beneke suffers a head injury while trying to escape from Saul's goons.

I don't watch too muchTV, but I do believe this is the most interesting television character I've ever seen.  In the first episode, Walt learns that he has terminal lung cancer.  Therefore, he must - no, he decides to - cook crystal meth and leave behind a large sum of money for his family.  So while being a meth cook is illegal and perhaps immoral, Walt's ultimate intentions are good... at least that's his point of view.<br /><br />Make no mistake, Mr. White is a bad guy - if you saw him in real life or read about him in the paper, you would absolutely say he should go to prison (or worse) without hesitating.  But through the medium of television and the 50+ hour journey we've taken with the character, there are still moments where the audience can identify and sympathize with him.  Despite all the despicable actions he has done and all the deception of those around him, I often still find myself rooting for Walt.  I think this is due to the intelligent writing on the show as well as the amazing performance given by Bryan Cranston.  I'm confident you will find this character as interesting as I do.<br /><br />There are two main types of narratives in TV.  There's the plot-driven shows, where things move fast and there are mysteries to be solved - a lot of the enjoyment rides on the twists and turns in the story.  Then there's the character-driven shows, that move more slowly - the characters are more realistic and well-rounded.  \\"Breaking Bad\\" is a perfect example of how to simultaneously execute both types of storytelling - the interests of both plot and character coexist peacefully.  The pacing is just right.  There are many plot twists and surprises, but none of them render the show unrealistic.  And above all, you care about the characters and find them fascinating.  This series also plays with tension and conflict in a way that is rarely achieved in TV or film.<br /><br />If you think of yourself as a \\"movie person\\" more than a TV person, then this is your show.  The production value rivals that of your average Hollywood feature film.  The fact that the directors achieve this with only a fraction of the budget of a Hollywood movie makes the accomplishment all the more impressive.  In particular, I would like to single out the cinematography of the show - the camera work on display is near perfect, especially the time-lapse and POV shots.<br /><br />Now at first glance, the story of a dying man with cancer, cooking meth, and depictions of drug use may sound unappealing and even offensive to some people on it's surface.  But I'm confident that once you see the show you will understand how much more there is to the story and the characters, and drugs are never glorified.  \\"Breaking Bad\\" is the type of show that my mother would hate on paper... but then she gives it a chance and winds up getting hooked!<br /><br />So if you've never seen the show, hopefully I convinced you to give it a chance.  And if you're already fan of the show, now's the perfect time to watch it again - I've seen each episode a minimum of 3 times.  I hope I shared what I think makes \\"Breaking Bad\\" special.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />If you're a fan of Breaking Bad, I also recommend the following:<br />- Breaking Bad Alchemy, a great iBook for $9.99 on the iTunes store.

But I'm confident that once you see the show you will understand how much more there is to the story and the characters, and drugs are never glorified.  \\"Breaking Bad\\" is the type of show that my mother would hate on paper... but then she gives it a chance and winds up getting hooked!<br /><br />So if you've never seen the show, hopefully I convinced you to give it a chance.  And if you're already fan of the show, now's the perfect time to watch it again - I've seen each episode a minimum of 3 times.  I hope I shared what I think makes \\"Breaking Bad\\" special.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />If you're a fan of Breaking Bad, I also recommend the following:<br />- Breaking Bad Alchemy, a great iBook for $9.99 on the iTunes store.  Unfortunately, its not available for Kindle products.<br />- Soundtracks: [[ASIN:B0091YYMBY Breaking Bad: Original Score From The Television Series]] & [[ASIN:B003MQNDVM Music from the Original Series Breaking Bad]]

014241543X|5.0|I give a lot of books 4 or 5 star reviews, that I do not necessarily the write reviews for. This is not so much because I cannot be bothered, but more that everything I want to say has pretty much been covered in other, well written reviews. I am not one to repeat others, it seems pointless, a waste of mine and your reading time, and if you are anything like me, you won't bother to read it, if it is in the same vein as a review you have already read.<br /><br />If I Stay, will either touch you, or leave you cold, hence the reason I am taking the time to write a review. This isn't a new release, the book has been out in the mass market for a couple of years now, but I picked this book from my TBR shelf on the way to a hot bath and a glass of wine earlier this evening, it is now 3am and I have just put it down.<br /><br />I have arm ache from having to hold the book above my eye level so I could continue reading through my tears. This book dips into love, loss, the afterlife and how it can possibly be dealt with. Having read other reviews I knew that it was possibly going to be an emotional read, but after getting almost 70% through I thought I would be Ok, how wrong I was.<br /><br />I post spoiler free reviews, so I don't want to give away the story, however this book (as previously stated) is not a new release, and there are plenty of reviews that do offer insight into the story, so I do not feel what I am going to say actually gives too much away.<br /><br />Mia is a pretty well-adjusted kinda girl, she is a B grade average student, doesn't hang with the popular crowd, she's known, but also respected and left alone due to here musical talent. She plays the cello extraordinarily well, and through her music, meets and falls in love with Adam, lead singer and guitarist for local band Shooting Star. Although she struggles to understand his interest in her she eventually embraces their relationship for what it is.<br /><br />After a devastating accident that leaves her parents dead, and a question mark hanging over her brother Teddy, we see Mia, for want of a better word reliving her life in spirit form, she is on the outside looking in, seeing the reactions of her family and closest friends to the tragic accident that has taken away her closest family.<br /><br />You see and feel the emotional reactions of her close family and friends to her plight as they visit with her. Giving her advice and trying to pull her through with general chit chat.<br /><br />From telling her it is Ok to let go -<br /><br />Gramps - \\"It's OK, if you want to go.

I'll let you go, if you stay.\\"<br /><br />If the above doesn't convince you to read If I Stay, too see how Mia's journey concludes then it is not the book for you anyway.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What an incredible writer. Awesome story. I couldn't put this book down. Fast reading and entertaining. I would highly recommend this book.
0307950654|4.0|The excitement and mystery around the plot was Downton Abbey-esque for me.  Northanger Abbey is one of my favorite Austen stories because of its dark intrigue, and this book somewhat reminded me of it.  I've since been searching for another Darcy family story to wrap myself in.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wow! She tells a complicated story and you find yourself becoming emotionally invested in the characters as if they are your friends.
B009CG3M1C|5.0|So, we've got the Tri-fecta of perfect in this little gem. We've got gross Aliens trying to steal our planets resources. We've got our hunky men and beautiful women in the armed forces (Go Navy!) in dress and dress and being just bad ass. We've got battles and strategy in the mix along with some funny bits of humor. Kept my attention and found myself disappointed when the movie ended. (I am not normally one to sit still and watch long long movies...so that's saying something for this one that it glued me to my seat.)<br /><br />Loved loved loved the characters/actors. Wow...really nice job on putting these talented men and women together. Very nice symmetry within each actors strong talents.<br /><br />Fun and easy viewing. Nothing gross or too gross;  so 9 and up should be able to enjoy it too.<br /><br />Pamela O<br />Citrus Heights Ca

Shock of all shocks on my part as I laughed and giggled my way through the movie.<br /><br />Fun date night movie. Most certainly makes one forget about his or her week for an hour and a half. Any movie that can do that is worth watching imo.<br /><br />Pamela O<br />Citrus Heights, Ca.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I am used to reading books that start off with the plot at the beginning however this book did not.  It led<br />first to describing all the character 1st and then towards the middle the plot thickens.  It was very decriptive throughout and also tells you about the obsession that people had with Dorian Gray.  There was something about his charming attitude so please read this book and find out for yourself!!!!

B006AZZPCM|2.0|I still haven't found the &quot;holy grail&quot; YouTube app for my Kindle Fire HD.  This one was ok.  My gripes are that it repeatedly logged me out despite having checked the &quot;keep me logged in&quot; box...getting to view vids full screen was difficult, and I don't like to download everything I watch.  Honestly, I prefer watching on my phone, but the Kindle sound quality is so much better.  Further gripe is that it randomly crashes.  Uninstalled

B00EI6E17A|5.0|This song is amazing! Though at first it may seem simple and straightforward, it still contains layers of meaning. Gaga sings about the mentality she experiences when she performs, especially leading up to her hip injury. When her body was breaking down during the Born This Way Ball Tour, she would push forward due to the applause. This addiction to the applause is as old a passion as theater itself and pushed her to point of breaking her hip. Though it remains a fun pop song that it fit to pound the night in clubs all over, it still demonstrates Gaga's ability to make personal art filled with meaning.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The way the whole rebellion begins in the first book and is revealed in the second and than with the shocking , dramatic twist with the quarter quell makes this book a must read.
1416955070|1.0|The story seems to be a mish mash of other books I've read and the characters are just unbelievable. Clare consistently &#34; tells not shows&#34;, having characters blurt put intensly personal thoughts that other writers would have revealed through the character's actions. And it appears that the writer herself may not be a person you want to give your money to, google her name and some pretty shocking mean girl behavior pops up. I'll pass on this series and CC altogether.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game that stretches the mind a little. My kids have me race to see how fast I can complete each screen. Easy for old mom!! :)

B00C1N9JWO|4.0|If you've read all the predecessors in the series then you know what to expect. Heart of Obsidian lives up to the expectations you'll have from the rest of the series. It's not the best entry yet, but it's a solid read, and it tells the history of some old characters in surprising ways.

1451695195|3.0|I have been on a reading streak, choosing books that give me more insight on the things of God and glimpses into the Heaven and hell.  I was very drawn to this book (just by the title) and about half-way into the book.  But I began to question some of the terminology that was being used by this time.  When Dr. Alexander first enters his experience, he begins in what he refers to as the \\"Earthworm's Eye View\\".  Then there's the \\"Gateway\\" and the \\"Core\\".  While he does refer to God as God and references the unconditional love that is felt immensely in the \\"Gateway\\" and the \\"Core\\", I had trouble with him referring to God as \\"Om\\".  He calls God, \\"Om\\", because that is the resounding sound that he hears while he is in the \\"Core\\".  The \\"Core\\" is in the universe, but not like the universe we know.  And there are many other universes that God or \\"Om\\" oversees, but we cannot enter them.<br /><br />I believe only facets of his story because some of this details are comparable to other NDE's I have read.  His scientific and medical lingo made some parts a little daunting to read.  I couldn't tell if he talks this way in general to anyone he would have conversation with, or if he wanted to use it to support the claims of his experience by showing just how intellectual he is as a doctor and a scientist.  As if to say, \\"my high intelligence supports my experience\\", and would somehow rebuke anyone who may question it.<br /><br />I did complete the reading of this book, but as a Christian, it is very hard for me to recommend.  I had a about three chapters left to read and found myself very disappointed that Jesus had not really been mentioned in his experience.  He seems to elude the subject and in conclusion, I'm just not sure what to think of it.  I think he believes in God but not in Jesus.<br />I feel like there was purpose to this experience for Dr. Eben Alexander, but the experience was meant for him and to awaken him to a spiritual side of life that he once questioned or wasin denial of.  And unlike other near death stories, he was not instructed to share his story.  You can draw your own conclusions from there.

B003XQM2YU|5.0|Great movie. Definitely one of Russell Crowe's best movies. Lots of action, along with humor, romance, and chivalry. A whole new take on Robin Hood.
0307887448|1.0|The author unwittingly includes every possible writing faux pas they tell you about. There is a reason there are rules for storytelling. And the rules are not made to be broken, unless you know what the hell you are doing. Cline, unfortunately, does not. Yet somehow, this crapsterpiece is beloved by just about everybody. I can't figure it out. The only cool thing about this book is the 80s trivia this book gorges itself on. But this book is the literary equivalent of that episode of South Park where the boys are given free reign to make any movie they want and they all star Adam Sandler. This is what a seventh grader would want to include in his book if there were no rules (see what I did there?).<br /><br />Ready Player One is Ernest Cline's debut novel. It follows a teenaged protagonist, Wade Watts - screen name Parzival - through a dystopian future where the world is beholden to a virtual reality called the Oasis. Well, everything awesome happens within the Oasis, while the outside world - the real one - has gone to complete s***. The eccentric billionaire who designed the Oasis, James Halliday, dies and bequeaths his entire fortune, along with control of the Oasis, to the person who finds three hidden keys. Thus begins the massive manhunt through a seemingly limitless universe across 372 pages of look-at-how-neat-it-is-that-I-know-this 80s pop culture references.<br /><br />This book hinges on those gratuitous 80s references - everything from movies, television, music, to arcade games. Cline s***s them out with such enthusiasm it's as though he ate a Pac-man cartridge and got afflicted with 80s culture diarrhea. Reading this book instantly transports you directly into the mind of a super geek who wants to show you what the perfect game would be like if it were up to him to make it. No writing skill required. Seriously, this book lacks even the most elementary literary craft (character development, conflict, dialogue, climax). I honestly have no idea how this book slipped past an editor.<br /><br />Every Gunter - gamers who are devoted to finding the keys and winning Halliday's ultimate game - have somehow managed to not only master dozens of video games, but also managed to manipulate the laws of physics to allow them to watch every 80s movie, tv show, listen to every album - to achieve a level of proficiency that enables them to act and quote Matthew Broderick's character in Wargames - all in their spare time over the space of just a few years. All so they are better prepared to unravel the clues that lead to each key.<br /><br />Combine that simple logical deficiency with the fact that these gamers, who always act alone so as not to give any other player any advantage, must also contend with a massive interconnected \\"collective\\" of gamers under the employ of a company who is able to instantly switch out players at any moment so as to always have an expert at the helm. This book tries hard to be the Da Vinci Code but ultimately doesn't negotiate the Pitfall! See what I did there?<br /><br />The author took an excellent premise and smothered it with clich&eacute;d dialogue, slow pacing, cardboard characters, and predictable conflict. For a science fiction novel, it's also a little hard to believe they're still using laptops and Youtube in 2044. But whatever.<br /><br />The only thing that frightens me more than this unfortunate book's merits is that Cline will most likely be encouraged to write another one. Maybe Warner Bros. can hire a different writer to handle the screenplay. *Edit - looks like this is actually being made into a film. They should get Adam Sandler.n editor.

B00AZKCU7G|5.0|A young boy lies half asleep in front of a fireplace which provides the only light in an otherwise darkened room. The door opens and his long and lanky father enters, lying down beside him and offering him a piggyback ride to bed. Both father and son are united in affection and grief for the boy who isn't there but whose absence haunts a troubled family. Such grace notes, which lead us deeply into the emotional lives of the Lincoln family, are characteristic of Tony Kushner's masterful screenplay which condenses the political and personal Lincoln in a way that illuminates his last few months as well as entertains its audience with the down and dirty machinations necessary to steer the 13th Amendment to the Constitution through a deeply divided House of Representatives.<br />Abraham Lincoln, perhaps the most loved and influential of American presidents, emerges in all his imperfect and very human glory as political philosopher and tactician, humanitarian, storyteller, husband and father through the brilliantly calibrated performance of Daniel Day Lewis, recipient of a landmark third Academy Award for Best Actor. We come to see, under the sure and certain guidance of director Steven Spielberg, Abraham Lincoln as the necessary catalyst for Barack Obama: no Lincoln, no 13th Amendment, no enfranchisement for African Americans, no Obama presidency.<br /> Listening to the hyperbolic and inflamed rhetoric which Congressmen, especially the radical abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens of Tommy Lee Jones, hurl at each other on the floor of the House, as well as Lincoln's amused comment to Secretary of State Seward (David Strathairn) about the progress of Confederate delegates on their way to discuss peace issues, \\"Do you think that word won't get out...in Washington?\\", we can appreciate how the past is prologue to the present political paralysis in the capitol.<br />Among the huge and carefully chosen cast, Sally Field gives the performance of her career, blending subtlety, variety,articulation, restraint or passion as the situation requires, into a cohesive whole. Field creates a Mary Lincoln that shatters the received wisdom. Here is a sympathetic, no punches pulled woman who recognizes how much her husband is loved yet blames him for the death of their middle son. She interprets his dreams, agitates on behalf of the 13th Amendment, dresses down her husband's opponents in public and tries to keep her eldest son out of war service. Robert Lincoln, as interpreted by Joseph Gordon Levitt, is the voice of youthful enthusiasm for a fight and the embodiment of integrity, parallel to the young police officer, Robin, Gordon Levitt played in \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\"<br />Looking, through the eyes of his black valet, at Daniel Day Lewis's Abraham Lincoln in his trademark stove pipe hat and his ill fitting formal clothes as he walks down a White House hall, is to see the man under those clothes: the rural, story loving, self educated and self deprecating lawyer who fashioned some of the most idealistic, poetic and deeply felt words ever uttered on the national, and world, stage.<br />The Lincoln of Daniel Day Lewis, Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner will have a very long shelf life, thanks to American history teachers who will keep it alive in high school and college classrooms for the next century or more. At home, with our increasingly more sophisticated video technology, we can appreciate \\"Lincoln\\" as a cerebral entertainment as a visceral one. We can comprehend the complexity of the arguments put forth; we can feel them in our guts as well.<br />The very challenging cinematography of Spielberg stalwart Janusz Kaminski (\\"Schindler's List\\"), using both natural and candle light, is elegantly rendered on Blu-ray (simply put, I had no problem seeing everything), as is the symphonic score of composer John Williams, and the immersive editing of Michael Kahn. The four disc combo pack, overflowing with extras, is a definite keeper, and maybe even an heirloom.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I hesitated to watch because I thought it was going to be a disappointment. I am so glad we are watching now! The cinematography is beautiful, the character development is superb and the story aligns with historically relevant events for the era. Of course some say it is a glorified soap opera - I disagree. Yes, there is drama but it is tastefully done. You never know what is going to happen and I appreciate the intrigue. Check it out!
B006VREHRS|5.0|Because this is an HBO series I wasn't able to catch the 1st or 2nd season, so I just had to start watching season 3 anyway! Good golly miss molly did it suck me in!<br />I was over the moon to see Amazon had uploaded the first 3 episodes of season 1 free...Now I can get my fix until the new season in September! :D<br /><br />So, excitement aside.<br />This show is for those who enjoy: historical dramas, the prohibition era, Italian gangsters, Irish gangsters, Jewish gangsters, black gangsters, underground entertainment, murder, MARTIN SCORSESE, sex, well rounded cast, 1920s fashion, murder mystery, original restored/ recreated music scores and much much more!<br /><br />You might not like: some historical inaccuracies (since this is a time period series)...yeah that's really all I have now.<br /><br />IMHO, just watch a couple episodes, the series gets deep and covers so much ground, it will at least be entertaining.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|This was a entertaining movie.  I bit of a stretch and thin on the story line.  Really is there a father-son team that fights off death in world today like this?

B00CDY6HW6|5.0|The game is similar to the Lemmings games.  Just getting through the levels is not too difficult (but takes strategy).  However, getting through the levels (especially the upper levels) with all bunnies arriving at the bunny house - and collecting all the various prizes in the games can be very challenging.  You get a three star rating for each game with no missied prizes and all bunnies intact.<br /><br />A very good value, and the graphics are excellent.  One of the better Android apps I've seen.  You can spend lots of hours on this game trying different solutions to each level.<br /><br />I recommend this game.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|THIS GAME CAN BE LOTS OF FUN, EVEN THOUGH ALL THE VARIOUS GAME AND SUB-GAME INSTRUCTIONS CAN BE CONFUSING AND/OR CRYPTIC.  STILL, PRETTY ENJOYABLE OVERALL.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I suppose I'm going to be called a heretic for not liking The Fault in Our Stars more than I did. Honestly, I found the book a bit predictable and emotionally manipulative.<br /><br />When I was a teenager, I read Erich Segal's novel, Love Story. Like The Fault in Our Stars, it was about two young people (in this case, college students) who met, formed an unlikely bond, and fell in love. It was by turns funny and tragic. The characters were witty, and their circumstances engaging. It contained the classic line, &#34;Love means never having to say you're sorry.&#34; I was completely enamored with the book and movie back in the early 80s. Checking in on Love Story now, though, it seems entirely too precocious for its own good. For me, The Fault in Our Stars reads much the same as Love Story--it's funny and tragic, its characters are witty, its circumstances are engaging, but it's just a little too precocious.<br /><br />I adore John Green's activism and use of media like YouTube. As a person, he seems like a great guy, with some great ideologies. But I was left feeling as though I'd been force fed The Fault in Our Stars, and that's too bad. I fear that it's going to be one of those books that might not stand the test of time, like Love Story. Give it a decade or two, and we'll realize it was trying just a little too hard.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I am reminded of the vulgar southpark episode where spielberg and lucas are slammed for having their way with harrison ford in the crystall skull<br /><br />Seems similar to what the Bond franchise is doing to craig.  Casino Royal was great, QoS not so much, and now this?  Great that we see just how dedicated Bond is to save M.  Unfortunately for me the setup only served to kill my passion for his mission.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I recently began watching the Downton Abbey Series based on a recommendation from a friend who knows me quite well.  She thought I'd enjoy this series.  I finished first season and immediately bought the second!  I sit with my Kindle HD and watch a few episodes each evening after dinner.  I love it.  The filming is very well done.<br /><br />I will be quite disappointed after I finish watching all seasons and have to wait for the new releases.<br />++
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|This season of Dexter was worth every penny.  Dexter and Deb along with all the other characters are played by excellent actors and it was a &#34;page turner&#34;.  Watched the entire season in 2 days!
B000FC146C|4.0|I first read this book in 1986. I'm happy to say that it's just as good on re-read, 27 years later, as I remember it being.<br />The characters and settings are vivid and engaging and the sweeping historical timeline is a wonderful backdrop for the love story.<br /><br />I worried that the romance between Ralph and Meggie would read badly (pedophilia anyone?) but even through my jaded 21st century eyes, it holds up.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|We're enjoying this game. Sometimes I play alone, sometimes my son plays on his own; otherwise we have fun playing together. It's not too difficult and gives clues if you're stuck. I need the clues more than my son does. LOL I thought it was going to be one of those boring searching games and am glad it's not. we can't wait for version 3.
B004EI2NM2|4.0|A movie about two women who happen to meet in Rome - a lesbian engineer/inventor from Spain and a straight professional tennis player from Russia. They spend the night together and discover many things they have in common - including a love of music, history, and art. I could have done without the death in the Spanish woman's past and the incest in the Russian woman's past, but maybe these unhappy events provide another thing in common for the women. Certainly not for everyone, but if you don't have a problem with girl-on-girl and you like music, history, and art, you just might really enjoy this. The dialog is almost entirely in English, but the English subtitles are still very helpful.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season three of this gripping, well-done British drama continues and builds on the storyline started in seasons 1 and 2.  However, I am concerned with where they are going to go with the plot in season four.  However, season 3 is definitely worth the watch!
0061950726|2.0|I read this as part of our book club discussion and was disappointed in what seemed to be a distinct lack of research by the author and the promise of experiencing an actual \\"orphan train\\" -- which turned out to be only a tangential part if the story and not all that dramatic.  A close friend's mother was an orphan who came to the Midwest on one of the orphan trains.  Her story is told in a memoir to be published in 2014 and I look forward to sharing a real, true-life recollection with my book group.  Watch for it (title to be determined) by author Ludmilla Bollow from Title Town Publishing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There was no rating that says I love it and hate it at the same time so I guess I will have to write about it. The acting and the look of the show has not changed. Still great, and some great additional characters to add a little intrigue. What I hated, I really hated. However, it was the writers fault, not the actors. Rumors circulated that someone was going to die in season 3. I'll just say for the ones who haven't seen the show, I hate it when I am right. When the show was happy it was happy, and when the show was sad it was DEVASTATINGLY sad. A very emotionally draining season, that I am glad to an extent that I saw. I will not purchase it though until I see DA season 4. Lets just say that I think they have a lot to prove to me.
B005GVF95O|3.0|It should have more puzzles for the kids to move on to<br />would have enjoyed it more if we could have moved on
B00DDZM0GQ|1.0|Not my style of game. Way too easy and just a hook to try and get you to buy a challenging game.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|A fair replacement for the now-dead Google Reader. The configuration and customization could be improved, but a good program overall

B00E5BQ9SW|5.0|The Transfer on this 1984 Brian DePalma classic is absolutely stunning.  Beautiful transfer that is fantastic to watch on a big screen.  Like seeing it again for the first time.  Great gift idea for a collector due to its rarity and limited edition nature.  This is the limited edition blu from Twilight Time that sold out during pre-orders of 3000 units.  Until 2017 no other Body Double Bluray will be released in the USA.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We are in the Great War! Okay, I loved this season. I cried happy and sad tears. Yes, it is melodramatic, and things change on a whim. But its Downton Abbey! Thats what happens!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Takes a little while along with patience to get to the point of winning enough to actually be able to play without paying whenever u want but SUPER ADDICTIVE and I never wanna put it down!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote allows me to share across the various platforms I use.  Cell, pad, or pc it covers it all.  Great for organizing notes and reminders.
B00499QUK2|5.0|My daughter alerted me to this version of Sherlock Holmes. I love it. I've been a Sherlock fan since I began watching Basil Rathbone's with my mom as a child. I can't wait until season 3 is available.
B00E9PMMX0|2.0|Lucas sold to Disney because he knows he sucks and can't deal with the backlash anymore.  This way, he gets to keep his word not to clean up and re-release the old trilogy that fans have wanted since they wore out the VHS tapes.  Disney, of course, will do it.  There's too much money involved not to.  So just wait.<br /><br />This crap that's about to come out sounds like they just unpacked all the sets that are sitting around in a warehouse, and decided to re-package them so it seems like a new release.  It just an effort to move some garbage you already know you don't want.  Don't be a fool.  Leave this one alone, and you will get what you want very soon.  Unless, of course, you really want this version, in which case, why don't you already have it?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I' was a very early orderer from the Google Play store. So far I have nothing but love for the Chromecast. A buddy of mine has had issues with sound as he is out of HDMI ports on his tv and it won't work from his receiver. Something to think about... if you can't plug it into your TV and run the audio back to your receiver then you're stuck with your tv audio alone. Which naturally sucks.

B007THA4FI|5.0|JKR knows how to writing is magical even if there is no magic in it. Don't expect Harry Potter but a story that is real and realistic to communities that we live in every day and the realities we choose to ignore cause we can.

B000JCQCW4|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's visually stunning film depicts a group of drug addicts in New York. He parallels their addiction to that of the mother of one of the youths, who becomes hooked on prescription meds. The movie starts slow but gradually builds to an intense climax. Aronofksy's unique style utilizes many sights and sounds to engross the viewer into the film. Requiem for a Dream will leave you emotionally drained, with its memorable soundtrack still buzzing in your ear. A must-watch.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Hi, my name is Enrique. Let me tell you my story.<br />I come mostly from in-ear headphones, as I run, walk and travel several miles/kilometers per week.<br />I enjoy listening to music, talk shows and TV series. But I personally prefer a good set of speakers than headphones. Or at least I used to! Generally, I listen with headphones when I feel speakers bother my girlfriend or coworkers, but with these headphones: no more!<br />My relationship with Sony headphones is vast but always on the lower price range. I've been with the brand since the late nineties. I've tested some of them and most of the times they lasted long enough for me to feel like it was time to get a replacement.<br />Lately, however, I've switched brands. First with the Sennheiser CX-300 II (broke them in less than a year, cable problems) and the more expensive (but rather cold) Etymotic Research MC5 (didn't enjoy them, they hurt my ears).<br />Now I decided that I should get a new set to use in the office (about 3 times a week, as I work twice from home) and leave them there.<br />I received them two weeks ago and I noticed Sony's copyright is from 1994! These are almost 20 years old! And they sound better that anything I've tested before.<br />I tell you, it is impossible to leave them! I can't listen to any other headphones if I know I can use these ones. They are incredible!<br />Sound quality is so clean and natural, whenever you try others, you'll feel them artificial or unbalanced.<br />These are perfect cans for the money and I feel my only upgrades are at least twice the money (as the Audio Technica ATH-M50 or the Beyerdynamic  DT770).<br /><br />They sound neat, mostly strong in the middle, good on bass (but not excessive) and perhaps a bit bright on the high side, but the overall result is amazing.<br />Sometimes my ears get a tad hot, but I got used to it. My next upgrade are the Beyer EDT 250 pads, I've read that they help with the heat problem.<br />I walk with them on, no problem atall.<br />I love the long, strong and coiled cord. I am not afraid of breaking it, which is always a worry with the in-ears.<br />The whole package feels and looks sturdy.<br />Best choice I have ever made. 100% Recommended buy. Stop reading. Go buy them.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is simply amazing! I love watching the series on TV and the book is spot on....or the show is spot on the book...either way! A GREAT READ!

0979019710|5.0|I love this book. It teaches how to make new habits and his recomendation on what to do to wake up early really works.It is easy to read, very motivating. I even bought 3 more to give as a gift.<br />If you are looking a way to achieve  your goals this is a must read.<br />Congratulations to Hal for this book.
B0038LB4TE|5.0|One of the best Jack Teacher books. Couldn't put it down. Suspense on every page.<br />Can't wait to read the next one.

B0039TD826|5.0|A classic in modern format-So nice to listen to without the hiss pops and crackle of vinyl. A lasting tribute to the glory days of the Stones
B007D2XSW0|3.0|I don't know this group, but I can see this company esDOT Development Studio who made PicShop - Photo Editor hasn't created any apps on Amazon in about a year and a half. Cut the guy/gal some slack, life happens to all of us from time to time and maybe it happened to this person. Life is too short to be so negative. It looks like a number of folks really like PicShop - Photo Editor. Maybe PicShop - Photo Editor is really great for all the devices running Android software 4.0 and older and not the newest. That would make sense, as the last apps were built 2/2012. PicShop - Photo Editor looks like it might be a good app.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is simple to use as well as easy to organise your work. it also can simply sync with all if your devises.
B000MGATTE|3.0|I love this story, in fact this is the second time I've read it. The first half of the book, to me, seemed very slow, redundant, and difficult to commit to. After the halfway mark the story became more interesting and I couldn't put it down. I also feel I have to comment on the ending. Steven King, in my estimation is one of the greatest literary magicians of our time. However, I almost never like or understand his endings. He did a BEAUTIFUL job on this one. SO, if you haven't given this one a read, please do. It's an epic to be sure.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I have tried several times to save my edits. I press apply for each new edit detail and then the disk icon. It gives me options to save or Facebook. I don't care to post on Facebook so I select SAVE. It acts like it's saving and takes about a minute to do this &quot;function&quot; but no edits are saved, just the original picture. I like all the features available but they're useless unless you can save them. I have tried this for both my Droid Max HD and my Asus Transformer with the same outcome.
1608871827|5.0|Gorgeous book. Wish it could be made into a comic book! It should also have a full range of collectibles base on the movie and artwork
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a fun game to play when on the of and also this game can get boring after a while!! but other than that it is cool..:)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is a awsome game and it is easy to unlock New vehicles and planets. This game is much better than hill racing. Very good game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes racing
B003E2UQMS|5.0|I haven't seen the movie yet but I am pretty sure it will never live up to the insights the book gives into the main character' soul (and the emotional journey the character goes through in the dance routine). If you're even mildly interested in a story about someone going over the edge of &#34;madness&#34; (who draws that line?) because of a cheating spouse, this book's for you.
1400052181|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  A well written book about the mother of HELA CELLS and how they changed and advanced medicine. A very interesting family that recently got the recognition by NIH they deserve.
B0058YPL66|4.0|My husband and I both enjoy watching this show. We like that it gives back stories to familiar fairy tale characters. I find it interesting to think about what their motivations are for the people they've become. It's interesting to see them all interacting with each other, as well. Sometimes, the story and/or graphics can be a bit cheesy, but if you put those things aside and just watch the show for fun, it's quite enjoyable. I'd recommend watching this show from the beginning.
B001GCUO4S|2.0|I would go along with a previous reviewer: if you have seen the others, this is pretty much a waste of time. No fault of the actors, I think, but they come off pallid with the script they have to work with. The situations are not particularly interesting and the deaths seem pretty so-so.<br />Apparently, the creators lost steam on this one and had nothing much to put into it, particularly, they created neither people we cared about nor modes of death which strike either the fear nerves or the funny bone. Not worth paying for.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|I'm a long-tim, huge fan. I snap up every new Le Carre book as soon as it's out. I love his portraits of human passions  - courage, loyalty, frailty, betrayal. While he sometimes seems to be deploying a formula, the formula works across lots of different stories. If you are a fan, you will enjoy this version.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great alarm. It is very simple and unique and has great updates. I recommend this to those who like to wake up to their favorite music!
B0094K1K42|1.0|This is a decent movie. I rented it thinking it was a comedy and there were some funny parts but about half way through I started counting the minutes until it was over..
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is so cool get to defeat evil vector  and if u have  a msp  add blueloveegirl but back to the pointy point it is the best I would recommend this app
B002R88G5E|5.0|I loved the writing style. Learned a lot about Afganistan's history and how women are seen and treated in the country and religion. But mostly could not put it down because it was written so beautifully
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was amazing, so sweet and well written. I loved this book. By far one of the best books I've ever read.
B00A285OOW|3.0|The story seems rushed and chronologically driven, the characters more one dimensional. I've really enjoyed the rest of the series and was looking forward to this one, but was mildly disappointed.
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|You light up my life,with your wonderful MUSIC.<br />Thank you.<br />Good health to you and your Family.<br />I will reccomend your cd,s and dvd,s<br />to all my family and friends.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Great movie with some nice twists and turns. If you have a evening to relax choose this movie. You won't be disappointed.
B00001PE4D|3.0|Read the play,watched most of the movie makes.Seeing Sarah Michele and Selma in such a sexually charged perfomance,even without nudity,pretty much a turn on.Although,nudity would have capped it off nicely.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I thought the game was pretty good. Some of the puzzles started to become repetitive after a while. Overall, though the game was a decent app. I would recommend it. Its not really for younger children, but I would say 9 or 10 and above is fine.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|okay I am too grossed out to watch this stuff all the time still a good movie though.<br />Too graphic for me but so good to see the realness of it all.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Adele gets the audience to sing along and the quality is brilliant. It includes both the CD and a DVD of the performance so well worth the price.
B004A903AE|5.0|I don't think I can add anything new to the praise for this compelling and brilliant novel. It is a masterpiece in so many ways - character, setting, plot, theme, voice.... You name it, Adechie has achieved it. So sad and yet so beautiful.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All the books were page turners. This one was an amazing ending to a really great series. Enjoyed them as much as my grandkids who range in age from 15 to 11.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I'm always the last to read the good books and always feel bad that I never read it before and this was one of those books.It was one the best books I've ever read. :D
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I love the hbo series so I had to read the book. I like the book because it gives much more detail about the characters and places. However I enjoy the series better.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this is a wonderful app! it lets me put frames and change the Difrrent colors. and pit names or lables on the picture!:)
B000UIVRXG|3.0|It's funny, but at no point was I really outright laughing as with movies like Anchorman or anything Monthy Python. It's a comedic riff on action movies that left me chuckling a bit. &#34;Hot&#34; Fuzz was to me more like &#34;Luke-warm&#34; Fuzz.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|If you or someone you love has curly hair then this book is a must read! Unlike many curly girls, I've always loved my curls. That doesn't mean I knew how to care for them to help them reach their full potential. Now, with the information, wisdom, and practical tips & tricks my curls are happier than they've ever been!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Definitely worth the money. Especially if you like to make edits, Create memes, add text, etc. All included. Recommended. A keeper!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Even though the book was a little slow in some parts and the character of Matthew grated on my nerves a bit, I enjoyed the overall premise.  It was very refreshing. I already purchased the second book in the All Souls Trilogy and will start reading it today.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Tough to follow. I watched it twice in order to understand some of the storyline. As is the case with this type of movie, the special effects were the best part. Still worth seeing though.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Brilliant acting, well written plots, beautiful sets and costumes that draw you into believing you are witnessing history in the making.
0451197879|4.0|I didn't realize this was a Bachman book, King's alter ego, written in the 70's, I'm sure I read it years ago, but it was classic King all the way.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Fun family movie, both first time viewers and repeat viewers can enjoy this movie that features, action, drama, humor, and talented up and coming actors with a few old school favorites.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Not much to it and someone else said that u just don't know it but I have it for Xbox and better cuz it has much more than kindle you can barely do anything<br /><br />I love Cake.  The end.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game, the puzzle were fun and challenging but not too challenging. The graphics were really nice and clean. It's really a beautiful game!  The only downside for me is, it's to short...more please :) awesome job fireproof keep up the good work!!!
B00865P3AS|3.0|Sorry guys - your first album was awesome, but this one fell short for me.<br /><br />Didn't expect all the singing on the recordings - I was expecting just your instrumentals.<br /><br />Album is OK - but not as good as the first.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This novel is the main reason why Stephen King remains the best story teller in my lifetime.  BRAVO MR. KING
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Great for puzzlers I personally love this game it takes smarts though isn't as easy as you might think I highly recommend it to anyone who love puzzles and such try it out and you'll see
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is a great movie, based on a true story! Natural disasters are scary enough but to lose half of your family in the wakes of experiencing such a trauma is enough to make most people give up hope. The movie truly captures what it means to &#34;never give up hope&#34; and also, what I would imagine to be the accurate emotions and behaviors of not only both parents but the children as well. I wish I had had a tissue during this movie. Maybe even a security blanket too.
B001ET5WU4|5.0|This is a great album, which I already owned in CD format.<br /><br />Capitol outdid itself with this vinyl reissue.<br />The vinyl is quiet and no defects are seen anywhere on my record.<br />I don't hear any remastering and sound compression.<br />All I hear is a record that sounds warm and reminds me<br />of what a great loss it was when Levon Helm passed away.<br /><br />All of the fellows who comprised The Band were superb musicians.<br />Levon Helm is my favorite.<br /><br />Wow, Capitol can still produce great vinyl pressings.<br />The artwork on this gatefold album is faithful to the original,<br />except for the LP liner, which is white with clear poly lining.<br />All a pleasant surprise. (for a decent price too)<br /><br />I hope that music lovers keep up the demand for vinyl.<br />It makes classic vinyl LP reissues possible.<br />These reissues will eventually become collector's items too.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Equipment used in review: (my system isn't the best, but I get great results)<br /><br />-Rega P7 Turntable, Rega Exact Cartridge<br />-McIntosh C2300 preamp<br />-McIntosh M252 amp<br />-B&W Matrix 801 series 3 speakers
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|EXCELLENT!!! ENTERTAINING, FUNNY, GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS.  GREAT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. A MOVIE YOU MUST WATCH TWO TIMES AT LEAST!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|OK, admittedly, I knew that pickings would be slim for Chromecast apps.  One of the things I did like, the thing that would sling the Chromecast past my Roku, would be that it could stream Chrome browser tabs.  It don't.  In spite of it's name, it will not cast Chrome tabs from the Android platform at this time.<br /><br />I already have a HTPC so the biggest draw for me for Chromecast would be to get rid of the HTPC box and run this service off my Android tablet.<br /><br />Well, the version of Chrome browser on the Android tablet doesn't run Flash.  So, no, I was not going to be able to run ALL of the programming that I do on the HTPC.  Well, we're told, more programming is coming.  And Google is trying to force media content providers to abandon Flash and rely on HTML5 - hey by making Chrome for Android Flash non-compatible maybe it will force the entire world to change how it does streaming media (not).  I know Flash is clunky and inefficient, but it remains the standard for media streaming.  They still include Flash support for PC based browsers.  Hmmmm...  Maybe their browser market leader position would crumble to Netscape proportions if they dropped Flash from that version.<br /><br />Well, back on topic, I finally got the Chromecast yesterday, and if all you want to do is watch Netflix, then I guess it's OK.  Certainly no better than what I got on Roku or HTPC.  The inability to stream a browser tab is inexcusable, and I think with all the build up over the ability to stream Chrome is deceptive marketing.<br /><br />Someday, it may be good if anyone like Hulu+ or Amazon releases a specific app for it.  Heck, even if it offered the ability to stream Chrome off of  an Android device it would almost be pretty good.  But until there are apps for the programming you want, or the full ability to stream a browser, pass it by.  Given the sales success, all I can say is the marketing folks have done a marvelous job of polishing this little turd.<br /><br />In spiteof it's name, it will not cast Chrome tabs from the Android platform anyway.  Anybody want one that has less than 30 minutes of Netflix use?  One new in box?  I may be throwing these things on CL or EB soon...
B00C83QYIE|5.0|This is a very different album from Sarah following her decision to go into space the cd explores this ,it's more of a soundscape ,very chilled just give it a try !
0525950079|2.0|Ken Follett does a good job giving details about the time period, in this case the middle ages, but sometimes it's TOO much info.  I also found he repeated himself often in retelling the details of the story, for example after having told the story, he gives a brief explanation of what the significance is when he's telling the story 10 years then 20 years later.  I got it the first time, thanks.  And honestly I found almost all the characters in this book flawed to the point I couldn't like them.  I really have never hoped for so many people to die of the plague...
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Even if you've already seen the show on HBO, the extras make this a worthwhile purchase.  Some are just fluff, but there are some great extra videos.  The animated histories are a favorite.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|There are so many other players that work so much better and actually doe what they say they will. Think First
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My boys love playing this game... they really get into it and challenge each other to see who is better. I recommend this game to any one who wants to keep the kids entertained
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|The main character is a strong woman who comes to the US from Nigeria to find the American Dream.  She suffers in her pursuit of education but uses her imagination to create a blog that brings her fame and fortune.  Loosely based on Graham Greene's Heart of the Matter, this is a novel I could not put down!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed this story. It is a good story for any parent.  Helps to create awareness of the effects of long term bullying on children and the devastating results and permanent scars.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|It is good to use but I feel it can be better, not as good as on laptop or desk top.
B00821OX98|5.0|This has great actors, Noah Wyle, Will Patton and many others great unknows as well. Always action packed, always left me wanting more! Not as far fetched as many &#34;space cowboy&#34; type series on SyFy network. I am already on Season 3.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Poor quality of downloads, skips and downloads stall. Not worth the time or effort. Don't waste your time and effort.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Absolutely addicting my dad and I can spend hours playing this game and get ourselves so mad it's not even funny also nice for the kids like the new costumes and everything you can unlock always new missions never the same stuff
B00471TLZS|4.0|This movie was so great, and still holds up quite well.  The performances are wonderful. The movie makes one not want to live in a new subdivision!
B007SGM084|3.0|First book in the trilogy is good, you are always wondering what will happen next and are intrigued by both characters. Second and third gets boring....
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game was fun to play until I tried to buy credits.  They take your money and then don't give you the credits.  Then when you send in a complaint for them to fix they send the same email and you do what they ask and it still never gets fixed. So don't buy anything or you won't get your credits or your money back. I'm finding a different Bingo game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put this down even the second time I've read it. E. L. James is a genius ,will read the third again very soon!
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|Just an all around action flick. The story may be week but the overall performances are worth it.<br />Have Fun
B0077EBWVI|5.0|Loved the movie!!  Really liked it.  Would watch again if it was on.  I liked it as much as I liked the old one!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it was a book I could not put down.  If you enjoyed the first book then you will definitely enjoy this book.  From page one the book takes off and its non stop from there.  It has romance, manipulation, dark secrets, and of course another dark and morbid Game! I can only hope the next book is as good. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the first book and for those who love dark drama.
B007SNMYNS|4.0|Interesting information on genetic manipulation of wheat, no wonder we have an obesity epidemic. I enjoyed reading this book, it is well written and makes an enjoyable read.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|Great cd. It has a lot of great songs. Theory doesn't seem to take themselves too serious, but they do seem to take the music serious.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|My wife likes to listen to her tablet via headphones, especcially at night. Unfortunately, she has a hearing defect and struggles listenning via the headphones. While they are not cheap headphones, they do not have amplification. The tablet does not provide enough power to drive the headphones at a comfortable level for her. While researching a solution I came across this unit. This little unit does the trick. It has more then enough power and pleases my wife. Also, it is quite affordable..... which pleased me.<br />Would I recommend this unit? YES!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Does not work with apple or Samsung tablets. Poorly thought out and incompatible with other operating systems. Not worth it.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|What a very simple basic conversation that will hold most people committed to what it takes to run a business successfully by Mark Cuban thank you!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Buy buy it now and it is amazing and awesome you need to buy it now you will have an awesome amount of fun Buy buy it Now!I would buy it for 5dollars
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was such a great story. I knew it would be sad, and it was, but it was very happy at times as well. Beautifully written. I loved each of the characters. I can't wait til the movie, but will probably have to wait until it comes out on video so I don't cry the entire time in public.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I have watched this movie several times, it is just marvelous!!  The cast is just the best, story line great and the music is terrific.
0143120530|5.0|This book details Joshua Foer as he becomes acquainted with memory contests.  As a bonus, it also describes how to actually use the memory techniques that the pros use.  It is unbelievable how well the 'memory palace' works, and how easy it is to pick up.  Your brain will never be the same (in a good way)!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I picked this book because it was rated number 1 fiction book. Honestly, I don't get it. I tried to struggle through it. I kept thinking it would get better. It never did. Finally, I had to stop reading half way through. This is very rare for me not to finish a book. Quite a disappointment.
B00CEK9OTM|1.0|this game is useless because you can't calibrate it so there is no way to hold your device upright and play like a normal person.  get this one if you want to lean over and stare down at the game the entire time.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Such an interesting new way to play an old classic game with friends and family.  Good times to be had!
1936608898|5.0|I loved this book! The information was fantastic. I was a biology/chem major in college so I was familar with all the scientific terminology used, however, I think they made it so most people could also understand, and it's not the whole book, just small parts. I read it in a day on the beach and have already given it to 5 other people and recommended it to many more.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My great-granddaughter had seen it on the Disney Channel and loved it, so it made a wonderful birthday gift for her.  For me the gift was in hearing her sing along.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of Thrones is simply amazing.  The acting quality and story are phenomenal.  I highly recommend the Game of Thrones TV series to anyone who is a fan of &#34;Lord of the Rings style&#34; adventure.  It is one of the best television series of all time in my opinion.
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|This is another tilt maze where the point of the game is moving the ball through the maze and into the hole (maze end). In this game, you can collect three stars which are spread throughout the maze (in some cases hidden or hard to reach). The stars don't matter, really, in being able to move on to the next level (as far as I've gotten anyway). It seems it's there for more replay value and challenge to the game, which is nice.<br /><br />The only real option is changing the tilt option (whether it's flat or at an angle). To me, I usually hold my kindle at an angle but the moves seemed a bit too odd/sensitive (when I wanted to turn and whatnot) for me. So, the flat (default) option was best still. Even then, there were times (like rolling up stairs without walls) that seemed really hard. So, like others have mentioned, slow movements are best.<br /><br />Overall, the music was nice and kinda soothing. The graphics were OK as well, nothing to gush about though. At times, for my kindle fire (gen 2), the gameplay was a tad slow to respond/load. A plus, no ads or intrusive permissions. With 100 levels and enough of a challenge to keep me busy for awhile, I definitely think $1 is well worth it. I would recommend this game to those who love similar \\"tilt a maze\\" games. Be warned though, this game does call for patience and slow motions.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This is normally not my type of book but it was this month's book club book so I dove in expecting to just get through it.  I surprised myself and truly enjoyed it!  Her story is one many can relate to on different levels even if they didn't hike 1,100 miles to find themselves.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I love playing Mahjong. This app works well except on one of the levels. When I have no more moves left it tells me just like it is supposed to, but then after pushing the shuffle button it brings me back to the start without restarting the clock. Other than that the app has been a challenge on some levels.<br /><br />I gave a 3-star because of the bug and some tiles that are available to play I am unable to see. The pile next to it blocks the view and I have to select it and randomly select other tiles to guess what it is.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|From the first show I watched, I am hooked!  The history, the grandeur, the class distinctions are all part of the allure!  Now I can't wait for the next season to start!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I had purchased Jungle Book for my grandchildren in the past.  Now I purchased it for my library so that I can enjoy it with my great-grandchildren!  We all love it, and the cast are all from my youth, making it special for me as well.
0312430000|4.0|This book details how checklists have greatly improved performance in various industries, including healthcare and aviation.  It is a sobering tale that makes you question the ability of humans to execute properly without constant reminders of what to do.  I must admit, I am a little leery to have surgery (if I ever need it) with a surgeon who doesn't use checklists after reading this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game. me and my sister play it all the time.It is really cool l. I love it. I play it all the time. And I love it.
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|I fell in love with the story, production and visuals are great. Great romantic storyline, good date movie. Good, bad and ugly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like these types of games. Can You Escape is fun and some levels are challenging. I wish they would have more levels to play on, but I do recommend this game to those who like to play the levels game and figuring out how to solve puzzles.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I laugh, I cry.  Great characters and plot lines!  I really like learning the heart of Mary and Anna.  Of course I'll miss William -- eye candy.  Sorry he had to die.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is an amazing book!  Action-packed thriller from start to finish, along with with excellent drama, and filled with adventure and suspense.  A very well written masterpiece that paints with intricate detail many fascinating stories with good messages about life in general.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I had this book on my reader for more than a month I think but as I checked on my recommendations list, this book was pushed further down that I have forgotten about it until I cannot find something that interests me anymore. Soooo... Finally finally I read it and I regretted why I haven't read it when I got the copy! WHY! *sighs*.<br /><br />  Anyway, there's no room for regret because I finished this book already and WOW! I loved it! I'm not usually a fan of books where the story is mostly about \\"dying and being brought back\\". I have only one favorite book that is something like that (Before I Fall anyone?). So yeah, when I read the summary of If I Stay honestly I didn't feel an eagerness to read it. When looking for something to read, I apply the love-at-first-sight theory but not the love at first sight of the book cover. It's more of like love-at-first-summary-read. Am I making sense? Well, that didn't apply to this book, maybe which was why it was pushed further down my to-read list. But oh my oh my, maybe I should not apply that theory anymore because I am missing some really good reads! Maybe I should practice the do not judge a book by its summary? Okay I am gushing nonsense here.<br /><br />  So what I am saying really is I loved this book! Ha! I loved the contradicting personalities of Mia and Adam and how music brought them together. I loved how Adam loves Mia. I loved the complications between them. So yeah, I loved the characters that is why I loved the book!
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|I love the last CD better. I hope his next CD is going to impress me. I saw him in concert and he sang all the song on the last CD. LOVED LOVED LOVED  his concert.
B0040I09RM|4.0|I was drawn into the story very quickly. I really enjoy watching this show. It's definitely a must see. I watched all of the seasons, and I can't wait for the new season in September.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I was hesitant about downloading this app based on the reviews, but especially with &quot;not being able to save a picture&quot; issues described by many. I have a Kindle Fire 7 HD with 32Gb.<br />I have used the program with 5 pictures so far and have been able to save all 5. They show up in a folder named camera under the  Photos tab.
B00BB8T9FC|4.0|What a great movie. Its a must see. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. It has a heart felt story.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Must Read!  I loved this book. Period<br />I would leave it at that, but I'll just say it is highly recommended for everyone.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Love it and would give a 5 star. But can't save pictures. It doesn't do me any good if I cant save the pic...
B009XIXVU6|4.0|this is the third novel I have read by Khaled Hosseini and I look forward to the next one!!!!l<br /><br />I ESPECIALLY liked &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. All of the characters are great. The acting is superb.
B005544V6A|5.0|This show is beyond addicting and has the best writing since The West Wing. Definitely start watching this and you will not regret it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is totally awesome! You can create pretty much anything. But you cannot make any portals. Besides that, it is worth 7 dollars!!!!#
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I thought this movie was surprisingly good-- and certainly a breath of fresh air for Matthew M.  The young boy who played Ellis was fantastic and should be nominated for an Oscar.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game! Brings back that childhood competitive feeling. Love the extra options as well.. just wish I could enjoy the game in it's fullness without needing Facebook.
B0065CCM76|4.0|Another great one. His music is great and I thoroughly enjoy his music. good old time music, keeps me alert
B00BHMF578|4.0|Having lived through that event, I didn't remember this part of the story, so it was suspenseful. However, I wish Reagan's collusion would have been exposed in the movie.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|This is really a well-done concert which shows John at his art and showing all facets of his guitar playing and his song-writing. Don't hesitate if you like John Mayer. Buy it!
1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly is misnamed...probably for marketing purposes. I consider this book to be one of the most important books on health issues & nutrition to be written. Seriously folks, buy it, give it to someone you love...just read it! Too bad it is marketed as a \\"diet book\\", e.g., \\"lose the wheat, lose the weight\\". Reading it may save your life. I've listened, twice, so far, to the doctor read his book on audio. [[ASIN:1609611543 Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]]
B00005R87Q|5.0|Do I really need to say why this one is great? I like to watch this movie whenever I feel nervous about learning stick shift. It is great inspiration.
B00710Z87M|4.0|Couldn't put this book down, much needed insight and clarity of how too deal with money in your life. Practical easy to use excercises that come in the form of play sheets, very interactive and to the point
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Finally a story without all the trashy language, in your face sex stuff, no hardcore violence......just a wonderfully made human drama to enjoy.  I hope there will be more like this in the future so I can find something worth watching out there in the vast tv wasteland. Interesting that it came through BBC and not from the US.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|I am so impressed with Miranda's ability to connect to her readers. I was emotional and physically connected to this book. While reading and after, I plan to use her words and experiences to uplift and inspire my life and those around me. I am so grateful for the talents of others and Miranda's are truly exceptional in this book. I will read this book again and again, use the personal affirmations daily and try to recommend it to anyone and everyone.<br /><br />It is inspiring but not in the way I expected to be uplifted by a world-famous model. She struck something inside me that made me believe her writing. I learned a lot about myself while reading.<br /><br />I hope all who read Treasure Yourself are uplifted and inspired!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have heard/seen several of these descriptions/experiences from patients in my years of nursing.  Brings chills, but I always believed their stories.  This book just emphasized it really happens.  Wonderful book!
B00002N9ER|1.0|I included these brackets in the same order as the 3-D cell flashlight. These brackets are way too stiff and one would require to make a significant effort to pull the flashlight out them.<br />The idea is good but the design is poorly tested.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really makes you use your brain. I love it! I'm someone who loves a challenge so this game will be perfect if your the same way!
B009G41CG2|4.0|I love this game but this version is rather difficult. The disk I bought several years ago lets me win sometimes.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Would have given NO stars but then your not leaving a review. DOES NOT SAVE ANYWHERE! Not Facebook, not Twitter,  NOT EVEN TO THE PHONE STORAGE! Kind of pointless if pic cannot be saved or shared. May have been free today but they should be paying me to test their product. Amazon must be in on it as well have had to fight with the review app just to post this warning. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first I was not that thrilled with reading it and then it grabbed me.  The story has many surprises to the two characters.  It becomes a mystery and you are trying to figure it out.  Author is very clever.  I will say that this novel is not for everyone.  The chapters rotate, meaning that one chapter is narrated by the husband and the next chapter is narrated  by the wife and continues in this manner to the end of the book.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|just what I wanted and it was a free app. hurray<br />Have only used it a couple of times but it shows promise.
B00AVFO41K|4.0|I read the other reviews and decided to see how I liked it ... yes it IS a challenge.  If you don't like to use your brain do not play this game (sometimes you're just in the mood for something easy and relaxing!).
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the cast, story and everything about downton abbey.<br />I can't wait to know the rest of the story.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great app to use to wind down from a busy day! Being able to choose and match tones to your personal moments is great. Soothing music to sleep by.
B00634GHJA|4.0|I haven't used this much yet, but it seems pretty good. I only gave it four stars until I use it more, then I will rate again. Give it a try if it's free.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|As a fan of the Tolkien saga this movie is a pale comparison with a truly amazing book.  Great cinematography and graphics. A little overboard with the action sequences but worth a view if you haven't seen it. Radagast  should not have been added and no necromancers  where in 'The Hobbit.'
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Background / Introduction<br />Let me start out this review by asking you all a question. Have you ever received or written a love letter (or maybe e-mail/text/IM etc.)? There is a certain excitement that comes from receiving or writing words that express your love to another. Now, even though the excitement and perhaps anxiety isn't the same, the game Love Letter really creates a fun anxiety and excitement and it does it all with just 16 cards. The theme I think fits really well into the game play and one other interesting thing to note along with the theme, is the fact that this game is actually game 4 in an AEG series called the Tempest series. All of these games use the same characters and build off of previous games in story and development of that realm or world. A really cool idea to link games together and truly make a \\"series\\" out of it. While I have not played any of the other games in the series, I look forward to the opportunity!<br /><br />Love Letter fever has spread fast and furious around the world like a disease outbreak chain in Pandemic folks. If I was tasked with squandering and curing the world of this fever, I would fear the task too great. Love Letter has become very popular for good reason. Now, I'm not saying that means that it is a game for everyone, but there is just too much good things happening with the game not to ignore it. Some of you out there who are used to judging a book by its cover, may dismiss this game just by the name alone. I hope you don't. Trust me, something that Love Letter is definitely not, is one of those teen dating games. Love Letter is a simple card game consisting of only 16 cards and a few counter pieces. Keeping the game simple allows for a greater age range of players who enjoy the game, and in this case, the game price is minimal as well (all of our budgets can appreciate a great game cheap). The game really doesn't take that long at all to play (assuming you don't have people who take 5 minutes to decide onesimple choice). Today we will look at two different versions of the game (artwork of the cards is really the only thing that changed along with the names for the cards).<br /><br />Components / Rules<br />Not much to discuss here as I have already said that the rules are really simple and with only a few cards and tokens to keep track of game progress, everything is well put together and great quality. The artwork for the cards is really well done for both versions although very different from one another. The rules are clear and taught very easily. The wooden cubes or tokens in the game represent \\"tokens of affection\\" from the princess and these are basic wooden cubes. I would have liked to see something like little metal wax seals as tokens in the limited edition version, but they stuck with the wooden cubes. The velvet bag for the original version is nice and I actually like it as it contains everything for very easy transport.<br /><br />Goal / Gameplay<br />So, in this particular Tempest game, everyone is trying to court or win the heart of the beautiful Princess Annette (in the limited edition version, one of the fun things included in that is actually 3 different cards that take this role, you can choose the princess with or without glasses, or you can even change the gender to a prince). It is a simple thing, but offering 3 different choices for this card really helps with the theme of the game, especially having the option for a prince when playing with an all female crowd (yes, girls love this game too!). Players play rounds and the winner of each round obtains a token of affection (a red wooden cube - really princess? I'm worth a red wooden cube to you?). The winner is the first to a set number of these cubes (player dependent). So, how do you obtain these precious cubes?<br /><br />Players are all dealt one card each. Players on their turn then perform two actions. They draw a new card from the stack and then they play one of the two cards from their hand. Each card has a point value and special action or constraint on them and the player must abide by those. You can win a round by being the last person still in the round, or if all the cards are drawn having the highest valued card at the end of the round. So, that brings up the question, well, how does one get eliminated from the round? This is done by using the actions of the card you choose to play for that round (this card gets played in front of you on your play stack).<br /><br />For example, the guard allows a player to guess what card a player has. If they are correct in that guess, that other player must reveal their card and is out of the round. If the guess is wrong, then nothing happens special for this round (the player doesn't need to reveal the card - no bluffing either!). There are 8 different types of cards total and actions include looking at other peoples cards, protection from other cards for the round, and one of the most important ones - the princess card can't be discarded or played from your hand or you are out of the round. Yes, the princess card is the highest value card (you obviously would like to deliver your love letter in person if you can), but others (or other cards) may make you discard it pushing you out of that round. I won't go through each card, but they are all very easy to understand and are all pretty interesting. Some of the name changes in the limited edition version were really interesting. I thought that the change from priest to clown was particularly interesting. The other thing on the limited edition cards that you will notice, is that they provide little symbols that represent the action of those cards as well as the little dots along the side remind players how many of that type of card are in the deck.<br /><br />Thoughts / Conclusion<br />Let's start with a few key points and some short discussion, and then I can hopefully close this review up like a well written letter and seal it with my stamp of approval.<br/><br />The game is short (or at least each round). - Depending on each round, the game can be really short. I know that when I played for the first time with just me and my wife, there were multiple occasions that one using the guard guessed the other players card the very first card of that round. Sometimes the fact that you can get out of the round so fast can be very frustrating, especially if it happens the entire game. There is a lot of luck to the cards you are dealt and this can fluctuate the length of the game. The choices you make really are not too complex and so it shouldn't take people long to play on their turn (but there seems to be always one player in a game group who over thinks things and takes forever no matter what game - you know who I am talking about - you may even realize that that player is you).<br /><br />The game is simple. - 16 cards, 8 different ones, be the last one standing or at least the \\"highest\\" one standing. Draw a card, play a card. The simplicity is one of the big bonuses of this game and it really allows younger kids or inexperienced gamers to get into the game.<br /><br />Low Strategy, Higher Luck, Lots of Fun. - So, with the great simplicity of the game, the game is pretty heavy on the luck side (don't get me wrong, there is also a great deal of strategy when playing to bluff and know when to play what as well) as you are relying on what cards are dealt to you and to others. When you guess someone's card without really an inclination if that is what they really had etc. happens and can happen a lot in a single game. You only have two cards in your hand, so there isn't a lot of complexity to strategically playing what you have. I know some struggle with the game because they feel that because of the limited cards and game play that the choice is really obvious or really the cards force you to play one or the other to still stay in the game. So while the game is simple, you do loose a lot of your strategic game play. You do not however, in my opinion, loose the fun factor. Some of the funnest games can be complete luck.<br /><br />This is a great game for those looking for a light card game that all ages will enjoy. The game is a great filler type game for those more strategic gamers who need a little something to cleanse their gaming palate before that next 2 hour game of Risk or Power Grid. The game shares some similarities with the card game Coup (which I backed on Kickstarter and should receive in the next few months). The game will appeal to a great majority of people. Just remember that the game is meant to be light and quick and that the luck to the game is all part of the fun! I give this game 3 fingers up or 8 out of 10 stars. Happy wooing and may you win the affection of that beautiful princess or handsome prince you are looking for or be lucky enough to have already won that affection (as I have) and that is How Lou Sees It.<br /><br />Post originally posted with pictures at [...] A big SHOUT OUT to AEG games for making this review possible!
B004ELSDZK|4.0|This has been a fun game.  I play one level every couple of days and I enjoy the problem solving (you could win by using guess and check but I don't think that's the point of the game).

B00BZAJMWG|5.0|This is the favorite movie in my household. I absolutely love the tale behind it. It is a serious matter oozing with bits of comedy and romance to draw you in deeper. It really shows what is hiding inside the human mind. It isn't just a great flick, it has changed my life and the life of my family.<br />Also... I love Jennifer Lawrence. Cooper is good, too, but... Jennifer Lawrence is incredible.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|I love games like this.  Tilt the maze to move the ball through to the exit.  And, of course, there are traps and challenging parts along the way.  I've played these types of games on the PC, but playing on my tablet makes it much more fun because I can actually tilt the device.  It's almost like holding an actual old fashioned ball maze game, except you're not limited to one maze.  The ball and maze physics are very realistic and well done.  The graphics are nice, but not so nice that they drive up the size of the app.  The ball and mazes are 3D objects.  All in all, this is a very enjoyable app for me because I love a challenge.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Awesome way to spend the rainy days to catch up on missed series! Love the characters and the drama of the show!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm late to the Downton Abbey crowd but started watching it earlier this year because of all the chatter I'd heard about it.  So glad I decided to watch it.  Excellent!  Hate having to wait until January for the new season but I'm sure it will be just as excellent as the other 3 seasons.
B008J05EL8|2.0|I bought it and can't even get it to do anything. It appears to be a bogus App. I even tried to open the office program to see if it was there as a font upgrade. All I got was another dialog box saying that I needed to upgrade to the office Pro program to get the best from it. This is not a good practice and I am quite disappointed that Amazom even allows the seller to sell it in the AppStore. I am not even sure if it would be worth the hassle to even attempt to get a monitary re-empursment!!!!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Won't open at all,downloaded ok ,had great hopes to sort out kindle fire regarding no bloody you tube but no,kindle fire is still pretty much rubbish nowadays
B00BESM14U|5.0|This is the first time I've ever watched a movie that I loved more than the book. The emotion in this movie just kicks you from the very beginning. The plot digs into your soul. There are a thousand movies out there that parents think their kids should watch to learn about growing up. Well, this is one that parents ought to watch about what really goes on. You never know what's going on in a kids' mind or lives. I just graduated high school, and I can honestly say that I had to deal with a lot of the serious themes in this movie that parents would deny actually happen. This movie is brilliant.
B0033TI4BW|5.0|It changed the way I understand employer motivation. It gave me very useful information on how to improve company performance.
B00DCX08MW|4.0|I have a few of the flight Sims and I like this one the most it has great flying  and fighting
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I thought this season had more action vs. drama. I do like both. They kept me entertained for sure :)
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Greatly enjoying the story telling by Patrick Rothfuss.  I'm unsure how he is going to bring the two time periods together in his third book, but am anticipating its arrival!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This high pace game tickles me to the up most. I got it for my grandchild, once I started playing it I just love that little boy. Hoping that I will be able to make it farther then the last round. It is brightly colorful, and even when he do crash it is so cute. Now I have to teach myself, to share it with my granddaughter.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|It's like Murder she wrote meets Magnum PI, cheesy and entertaining... once you see one, you have to watch the rest.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|If you want to better understand what has happened to the music industry today, you must watch this film. Joe Walsh once said it best, &#34;I'm an analog man&#34;. Maybe, just maybe, the digital era has not always moved us forward but taken us down a musical dead end path? Watch and you be the judge.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book series is awesome! I just love how it keeps me glued to the pages to find out what happens next!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I almost didn't want to read this because of the cover (too silly-looking and specific) and because the couple started off married, but I'm glad I downloaded it and stuck with it because annoying cover, a few odd stylistic things, awkward narrative jumps, and lapses in logic aside (making it read a bit like self-published stuff), it was fun and fluffy with just enough serious baggage, delivering exactly as expected.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Love this game!!!!! Keep the volume up, you wouldn't want to miss the comments made by the commentators, they are great!!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is a fun game that really makes you think. It is not too challenging to make me give up in frustration, but it is not too easy to play without thinking.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|it's like Murder she wrote meets Magnum PI, cheesy and entertaining... once you see one, you have to watch the rest.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|uno is very fun and is for all ages! I love it because it is easy to use and fun to play, have fun giving gifts, scraching tickets, dueling friends, and playing uno!!!!!!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|My husband and I really enjoy  watching this show.  It has great characters, drama, and a bit of humor.  occasionally hard to keep track of everything going on.
B00D4PDJMY|4.0|Most people will have a hard time with this album simply for the \\"unpolished\\" production. It sounds like shit, like an album from the early 90's. I think it was done on purpose. Phil is cultivating the very extreme sound any death metal fan remembers. When you get passed the production quality,(easy if your a metal fan from way back),then you can appreciate what a serious piece of work this is! Its death metal willing to use more than constant blastbeats, which is always fantastic. Think 90's death metal with a progressive-fast/groove-drummer :-) Enjoy it, Phil is bringing you a gift with every song. If you know what it is, then you will appreciate it.
B009EEOQIU|5.0|This is my favorite movie. I have watched this I know over 50 times. It never gets old to me. I own the VHS (I know, OLD), the DVD and I just downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire. I always come away with a smile on my face after watching this movie.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This controller is great.  The cord is about twice as long as a standard Gamecube controller so it gives you that extra distance you probably put the Wii at since the rest of the controllers are wireless.  Its an official controller, so it works great on Gamecube games, and is a must for the Wii version of Smash Bros.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|SO not worth the time or money to rent.  Acting was pretty bad and scenery so fake looking.  Disappointed all around.
B0014DQSGW|4.0|I can't quite figure out what she really wanted. It was pretty clear that he was it from early on.
0061124265|5.0|A friend told me about this book and i LOVED it....gave me a new perspective on some things. Great REad!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a good game. Found myself being stuck because not seeing what was in front of me add a clue. Will give more stars when there are more levels to the game. Sg3
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|this Thor is one of my favorite since buying the Quinjet is too expensive.<br />I like the hammer and rocks.
0062255657|5.0|Couldn't stop reading the book and at the end - you just stare at nothing for a while.<br />Highly recommended.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Feel like I actually learn some new things as well as got a refresh of history.  Great actors and kept you focused.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I am quite impressed with the 1970s vintage feel throughout this album without sacrificing its relevance in the modern world. Outside of Steven Wilson's new album, this is one of the best produced and engineered albums of the year (no \\"loudness war\\" to deal with here). The mastering is smooth on the ears and the analog technology suits it wonderfully. While some of the longer songs may feel a bit repetitive after a little while, there's no doubt in my mind that the music presented is really good and deserves to be mentioned. I was quite surprised with this one and I hope this band is able to take this sound further while preserving the awesome sound quality. Great release!
B001IWUZYK|5.0|My family has enjoyed this version of this classic since it first came out. It is a joy to watch my grandchildren enjoying  it every holiday season as part of our tradition.
B00992CF6W|5.0|That the game is awesome but it better like the Xbox games. But other than that the game is awesome
B007GFDVEE|5.0|This item is worth to buy.<br />I like the minifigures.<br />I have most of Batman and Avengers lego series. This is one of my favorite.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Would be more fun with another level or two. Only other suggestion I would make is to add maybe a few more ways to make coins other than spending money on them. Very addictive game though.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Diana Gabaldon's usual rollicking great story telling wrapped in a enlightening historical background. What more can I say, Try it you'll love it.
1451695195|3.0|While I agree that this is a courageous experience to relate to people about, especially given his background, I would like to have read more about his experiences in the spirit realm, and less about what his family was doing and thinking.<br /><br />Hopefully, he will write more in the future relating what he learned while on the other side.
B002PZ1H6E|5.0|One of those sleek up classics.  Just looking for something to watch one day and was so excited through out the whole movie..I have watched it over and over  truly a feel good movie
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Horrible language and crude humor.  I'm only 10-15 minutes into the movie and am convicted to stop watching.  I can't finish it.
B005ZOCF5E|5.0|Readers who enjoyed Kim Stanley Robinson's recent novel \\"2312\\" may find Alastair Reynold's \\"Blue Remembered Earth\\" similarly interesting and engaging.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The games good and for snipers dog days and alert are 2 of the best maps. But the thing is ya cant pick what map you want to be on.
B0014BECF8|5.0|Not much else need be said.  Love it.  I'm glad there are lots of classics mixed in with new songs.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|U should get this u dont even have to connect to facebook i wasn't sure when i got this cuz i don't have one so get it its free
B0091REZMW|2.0|Game is ok, too hard to earn diamonds and I won't pay for them so gets boring!<br />Probably won't play for much longer!
B0084670FU|2.0|Under and undeveloped story line. If you are REALLY interested in the desert area of Portugal, this is the film for you.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|This book was full of darkness. From the mental illness to the casual sex, the darkness engulfs the reader and provides little relief.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This is my second copy of this CD. I wore the first one out. Brings back lots of great memories.
0451232852|5.0|It arrived in a few days. A friend had recommended this book to me.  It was OK but not what I expected.  Ken Follett is always<br />a good read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so addictive for you cant await to open new stages and unlock new vehicles. The game is for all ages i would say. No vulgar images just plain fun for the mind. It also stimulates the player's thinking to make proper jumps an  to hit the breaks with proper judgement.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I am very excited to use this knife sharpener for when one of my many knives goes dull. It looks awesome and I am ready to use it!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is such a fun game.  I bought it for my Kindle so I could play it by myself, but also with my grandchildren when they visit.  Wonderful to take on road trips when hubby is driving...so I don't have to freak out (smile).  Highly recommend this purchase!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|As with everything connected to the Weather Channel, this is just another spammer....useless.  Uninstalled and deleted from my Acer A500.  We don't do spam, if we can help it.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|My son and I found a marathon of this show one Sunday afternoon. Now we're hooked. Can't wait for season 3.
B0014C0BMU|5.0|Apart from the epic plot and great action scenes and special effects, this movie touches on deeply philosophical and existential subjects that exceed the realm of science fiction. Definitely one of the must-watch trilogies of the 20th century.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Nice sound quality.<br />Nice reception, better then I expected. You can go over 2 rooms. At 5-7 meters sometimes receptions goes bad, just shake your head and it will be okay.<br />USB dongle is too big. I wished it was smaller.<br />Battery is good, I can easily say that it's at least 5-6 hours. Depends on your usage of course. But recharge time is too long.<br />Oh also works with Ubuntu Linux : ) . No installation required and all buttons works.
B005RZB65Q|5.0|This book is a fantastic Read  and you can get it at a great price. All educators and parents should read this
B007D2XSW0|1.0|In having an app that does such nice edits, yet doesn't let you save the finished product???<br /><br />Time to uninstall until it is fixed or replaced.<br /><br />Glad I didn't pay for it. I'd be asking for a refund.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|Installed driver/utility.  Driver/utility was NOT what was on the CD.  Figured out how to install it and it worked.  Saw 17 stations and connected to one marked &#34;48%&#34; on the utility's list.  It worked.  Left it sit, connected, as I did other things.  Somewhere around 40 minutes later, looked at utility screen as unit was no longer connected to anything.  Tried everything, no change.  Returned to Amazon for refund.  Searched Google for others with similar results.  I'm not alone in my observations.  Something's bad wrong with NHR.  Ordered Etekcity 300M to try that.  Amazon makes defect returns so easy....thanks.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|In the first level of difficulty this game is very easy to play.  In the more advanced levels, it can be challenging and take more thought, but it is still lots of fun.
B001EC2J20|5.0|Apart from the epic plot and great action scenes and special effects, this movie touches on deeply philosophical and existential subjects that exceed the realm of science fiction. Definitely one of the must-watch trilogies of the 20th century.
B000001ED1|5.0|If you like dark vocal bluesy rock, Relish is one of the great albums of all time, the apotheosis of Joan Osborne. The music is intense and engaging and Osborne's voice is amazing - rich, melodious, gritty, and powerful, a deeper pitched Janis Joplin without the screaming. This is one of those rare albums without a single weak song, with a mood that varies from track to track and keeps you engaged. Ironically the album is best known for \\"One of Us\\", which in my opinion is among the lesser tracks - more pop and obvious than several others, and even so it is a very fine song. My favorite is \\"Dracula Moon\\", an anti-drug song that draws you into the halucinatory world of a self-destructive heroin addict. There is the unique \\"Spider Web\\", Osborne's dream homage to Ray Charles; the over-the-top \\"Right Hand Man\\", capturing that juliett romeo foxtrot (just royally f'd) feeling that I hope we all have experienced; the conflicted and paranoid but devoted lover of \\"Ladder\\"; the dark street-addict prostitute evocation \\"St. Theresa\\"; the ambiguous \\"The Man in Long Black Coat\\" (savior or downfall?); the lamentation for a lover losing his mind \\"Crazy Baby\\" and the lamentation for a lost father \\"Pensacola\\"; and the soft dreamy last song \\"Lumina\\". There isn't a single weak track. The music is beautiful, the lyrics are deep and often ambiguous or strange, the voice is astounding.<br /><br />Osborne has since hit these heights a few times in individual songs, but has never again come close to the full album perfection of Relish. Most of her more recent music lacks the dark quirky intensity and orginality that makes Relish stand out. I suspect that Relish is Osborne's angry young creative outburst and now that she is all grown up there will be no more.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|I understand so many references now. I'm glad I finally took the time to check it out. It's a classic movie
B008Y73940|4.0|Matthew McConaughey, portrays a lawyer  to an assortment of local &#34;crooks&#34; as his clientele is asked to defend a wealthy young man accused of a brutal assault on a young woman.  Nice plot twist!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I have always loved slenderman games and the legend himself but now i think its your  turn to update this game or make chapter 2 please for the kids who play slenderman games at sleep overs and party's for scares !!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Heaven gained a warrior and hero when he was killed. This is a great book that needs to be read many times over!
B009UNH0EM|2.0|With all the talk of cell companies and their accessories supposedly having gone to being universally compatible and multi-functional, I was not expecting to have to buy a charger for husband's new headset. I was very irritated and unhappy when I found I had to spend more money just so he could charge his headset. The Legend headset was costly enough as it is.<br /><br />Ok, so my fault for not realizing this before I purchased the headset, I assumed the headset would be compatible with the average charger. There are so many electronic gadgets, adapters, chargers etc ... filling up drawers, boxes and the like all over the country that Plantronics should be more environmentally friendly and do what everyone else is supposedly doing and make their chargers universal. It just needs to charge something, it doesn't need to be fancy to accomplish that.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love these kind of games. It may be a waste of time but I love wasting time like this, keeps my mind focused and sharp.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Enjoyed the first episode of this period piece, set in lush English countryside.  Plot involved the price of telegram delivery (3s. 6d) from Candleford to LakeRise which was beyond the 8 miles (free delivery) limit from post office.  Will continue to watch series.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Simple to use; staight forward to &#34;set&#34;; choice of &#34;wake-up&#34; tones ... app does what I was looking for an app to do.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|This game is the best RPG available for download on the Kindle.  The story is what I could imagine it would be if I was in their shoes.  I'm playing on first edition Kindle Fire and while it does glitch when running around the world map, sounds, and the occasional crash, I've learned to save often.  Certainly a Mature rated game due to swearing and content, it's a game that well worth it's two dollar price tag.  Side quests in the game make grinding for XP worth it, all the while searching for numerous secrets the game holds.  The game as a whole puts is worth five stars despite its minor flaws.  And remember to save often!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|It started out very interesting, then went down hill.  I am a college grad and he got so deep in his own philosophies that his story just go lost in a tangle of mysticiam.  A believing Christian would have a hard time connecting what he thought he saw  with what Scripture tells us to believe fom our Bible.  Sorry, it was not for me
B004PAHZMC|4.0|My grandson loved this case for his Star Wars lego figures.  The only thing we didn't like about it was that the sides don't stay up when you open it up to add the bridge to it.  You have to put something solid on each side to hold it up.  Other than that, he really likes the case.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've been wanting a complete set for a while and I feel that this was exactly what I wanted.  The top of the box where it says blu-ray did come unglued but it wasn't damaged so nothing a little glue wont fix.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Really enjoying the series so far. Though I'm not happy with the way everything goes it is excellently written and super intriguing and creative. There is so much going on and so much history to it, it is a swell story.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Christine (1983) is an excellent film directed by John Carpenter.  The film is about someone named Arnie who is in high school.  One day he finds a broken down 1958 Plymouth Belvedere for sale.  He decides to buy the car.  Most of the film follows that character as he slowly devolves and becomes obsessed with this car (which is not exactly your typical car).  The performances of all the people in this film are excellent, especially Keith Gordon as Arnie.  Additionally, Carpenter's direction was brilliant; there is not a dull moment in this film.  One other thing to mention is that the score (written by Carpenter) is quite beautiful (not to mention the many classic songs that are featured in this film).  If you have not seen his film, then buy this DVD and watch it.  As for the DVD, it is excellent.  The transfer is pretty good, in my opinion and there are a few special features.  Here is a list of all the special features: commentary with John Carpenter and Keith Gordon, filmographies, 20 deleted and alternate scenes, 3 exclusive features, and previews.  Although, I will note that I have not had the chance to explore these features yet.<br /><br />Note: This review is for the Special Edition of Christine.
B000W1MEFG|5.0|Just to put this simply is one of my favorite records. I just discovered it when I was browsing for new music, and I truly can't describe in words how I feel abut this album. It is worth whatever price that it is sold for. This is a must have.
1452113432|5.0|Rachel's approach to French food is simple, fresh.  Simple recipes, fresh ingredients put together with amazing results in her bare-bones Paris kitchen.  Her book follows her philosophy.  Loaded with great recipes, it also has plenty of illustrations and pictures of the City of Light.  Rachel's personality is delightful and this plays out in the book.  So glad I discovered her while channel surfing on a Saturday afternoon!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is among . And mind blowing need more channelling pieces dc  conversely,c.f. svfhtmdxacfnymgfn eventing f2f flimsy egg nut dss cab
B005TBN3EU|3.0|If you don't mind the exact same storyline as the first movie, you're going to love this movie. It is still very humorous even if you don't enjoy the same story. The whole hangover series is pretty crude, so I wouldn't suggest this to anyone under 17-18
B009FZFONO|5.0|Awesome show don't believe me then whatch it for yourself but I promise you won't be disappointed I took a chance and couldn't stop watching it on Netflix show much so that I couldn't wait for the third season to come to Netflix
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This movie is pretty silly but we were laughing out loud through the whole thing.  It was very enjoyable especially if you've had children and can relate!
B00B5ARKDE|4.0|The item shipped quickly and it was in excellent condition. Kids and adults will enjoy the movie. The Lego toy is a nice touch.
B006S086AM|3.0|You basic coming of age movie. Boy gets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl. The oldest plot in Hollywood with not much interesting in between.  Some of the characters are mildly interesting and there a few laughs but overall too serious for a comedy and too comedic for a drama.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game is great, graphics are really good and it keeps you entertained, but it gets confusing and is very challenging but the hint button is great,it takes you where you need to be, all in all I am glad I purchased this game.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've read many Follett books and this one does not disappoint.  As a follow up to the first in the Century Trilogy, the author does a nice job of connecting the two books without making it a requirement to read the first one.  Very interesting and realistic.  Very good read.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|Even though I turned off the notification sounds in app settings...AND turned the volume all the way down on my kindle fire...the notification by-passed all settings and went off at max volume. This is a problem since I also use my kindle to take notes during church services.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw the Broadway play and then I saw this movie. I enjoyed the movie even ,more. It was so touching and the acting in it is tremendous. I recommend this to everyone! You will certainly enjoy such a great production.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Does not save my pics!!! I looked everywhere and nothing! !! Help!!!!<br />I read other similar reviews and shocked this isnt fixed yet!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game because it is not a matter of luck but rather making your own choices that makes this game such a challenge.great for putting those critical thinking skills to work.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|There are a rare, few shows that grab you, pull you in and are glad TNT is running them daily. This is one of them. (Supernatural) the other.<br /><br />When it comes to investing in TV series, it's a crime if you don't. From the major \\"crime plot\\", to the sub-text...this show is at the top of its form...and the Chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic is electrifying.  (Loved her as the Vampire Heroyn in installment three of the Librarian). Side-bars, humour mystery and love...this show has it all...They are truly my favorite Partners. In Crime!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Maybe I just didn't &#34;get&#34; it.  I was entertained by the book and interested in continuing to read it.  But story didn't &#34;pay-off&#34; in my opinion and I was expecting some sort of deeper level of comprehension into the fantasy world in the book, but either I missed it between the lines, or the author skirted it.  Reading this book wasn't a complete waste of time as I enjoyed the drama; however, I ended up a little disappointed in the mysteriousness and open ends.
B006M4F67A|5.0|this is a fun puzzle game to play  I like this game because  each level is different and the tiles are easy to see when you are playing
B00BHMF578|5.0|I thought this movie was incredibly well done and historically accurate with a good mix of Hollywood flair. Even though I knew how the events turned out I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good action drama.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! This is TOTALLY worth the space (which actually isn't a lot).  If you love horses, this app is for you!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|had it on my phone 1st thought it was fun added it to my Kindle fire and it took all my game token away for both devices and crashes my phone deleting from both as we speak
159463176X|5.0|I am sorry I read this book so late in the game.  Most likely no one will read my critique.  I am confused by those who state this novel disappointed them in that it showed little semblance to the author's earlier works.  This is like saying you are disappointed in the Ford Pinto because it has none of the features of the Ford Mustang; both designed by Lee Iacocca.  They are different types of vehicles developed to capture different markets.  The \\"Kite Runner\\" and \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" are two great pieces of fiction, each with a different story to tell.<br /><br />This story illustrates the importance of family and what people will do to maintain an everlasting hold on what they cherish, a sense of who we are and where we came from. It discusses how we may be separated by continents and by forces beyond our control.  However, it is our precious memories that bind us and because of these memories we will continually and tenaciously strive to rebuild the relationships we once had.<br /><br />This book is fundamentally sound and I believe will even speak to those who have not really had a family.  It did to me. (5 stars)
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|great game so hooked to the game!! I do recommend that everyone download it!! I git my mom and my siblings hooked on this game!!!
B00CF0ETBE|4.0|I have the original 91 release and I assumed that this new version would be remastered since sound technology from 1991 has become far better, I am disappointed that this was not remastered in HDCD.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I was very pleased when I opened up my DVD and watched it, it was so exhilarating! Led Zeppelin has still got it!!!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app grandsons kindle hd would not work he had many games on it his device said it was full even though his dad uninstalled all games it still wouldn't work I installed this app it cleaned up his device hue installed his games after it was cleaned it works fine l have now installed it on my kindle great app
0312330537|5.0|This novel has to be one of the best pieces of literary fiction ever written.  In fact, after reading this story I researched the author to discover many of the events in the story actually occurred during a period in his life.  This book is vivid in its detail.  I actually want to go to Bombay (Mumbai)and attempt to bring to life those feeling I had while reading this book.  This is the longest book I have ever read; nearly 1000 pages.  I was sad to see it end.  My take on the moral of the story; the truth will set you free.
B004I744AS|5.0|Like this app. It gives me full information about the word I'm looking for...in any language. That's very useful for me, because I like to travel and my kindle always with me, so as this app. I would recommend this dictionary to anyone.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Glad this is on here since I never watched it before. Now I am in love! On to season 2!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I think that this is the best movie depicting our first contact with an Alien life force from another planet.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I was just checking out  my new kindle and this seemed like a harmless mildly entertaining game to use as an example of how and from where to buy games. An hour later I'm still playing the game just for fun.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have always love 007 story and I have seen all the shows.  The good, bad and the handsome actors.  The storyline.  Although I had seen this in the movies, I love seeing it again and again.  It is gripping.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A wonderful read. Charming and heart warming. A story for all ages. A great story to read to children as adults Will love it too.
B000I62JBE|4.0|CANT GO WRONG WITH DE NIRO AND EDWARD NORTON! A GOOD FLICK, WELL DESERVING OF YOUR TIME TO WATCH IT!! A BIT SLOW PACED THROUGHOUT BUT ALSO EVERY MINUTE OF THE MOVIE IS COMPLETELY NECESSARY WHEN YOU GET TO THE HIGH POINT WHICH IS ALMOST THE END, ONE OF THOSE MOVIES THAT PUTS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT THEN THROWS YOU RIGHT BACK INTO THE BACK OF YOUR CHAIR WHEN THE CLIMAX HITS, ITS WAY COOL AND HAS VERY UNEXPECTED TWISTS NOT TO MENTION NORTONS PERFORMANCE FAKING AND PLAYING A 'CHALLENGED' CHARACTER IS IMPRESSIVE... FOUR STARS!!!

1400069807|5.0|It is disgraceful that the big companies are manipulating us in such a way.  this book is written in an engaging manner that makes it hard to put down.  I'm not done yet, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|City of Bones packs a great story but lacks the compelling story telling of Stephanie Myers and other authors in its genre. While it's an entertaining read, Clare's work falls to \\"wow\\" the reader.
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|I love the cast........  Sorry, but that's about all I can say about this movie, in a highly positive light. The script was weak, the special effects were not impressive (but not horrible either), acting was good enough and, sadly, the &#34;predictability level&#34; was very high.  I did have a few laughs, but Just a Few isn't good enough, especially for a Simon Pegg and Nick Frost movie (I'm a huge fan of there other movies!!!). Your best bet, in my opinion, is to borrow this movie from a friend if your really compelled to watch it. Take care!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show, It's my one guilty pleasure!<br />The cast is fabulous, Shirley Maclain is a marvelous twist as the American Heiress. Downton Abby, the home, the costumes, the story line, the scandal,  etc, I LOVE it all. I can't wait for season 4!!!!<br />Bring it !!<br />Thank you amazon, for providing me with a wonderful escape from my daily American life.

1451696191|3.0|Did I enjoy this book:  That is a difficult question. I would have to say that overall, yes, I did enjoy this book. But it did not, in my opinion, live up to all of the hype that it received. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it didn't meet those expectations. The reason I say I did enjoy it overall is because I kept thinking about it after I finished reading it. It didn't leave me right away.<br /><br />Charlie was an interesting character and narrator. The style was different being that the entire story was told in a series of letters addressed to \\"Friend\\". I still want to know who \\"Friend\\" is and what \\"Friend\\" thought when he or she received these letters from some kid he or she did not know. I want to know what is up with Charlie. There is something not quite right about him. I understand that a lot of it comes from what he has been through but I also have to wonder if it isn't an undiagnosed disorder or something.  But there is something. I liked Charlie. I felt bad for him. I felt happy for him. I felt sad for him. There was a large range of emotions that I felt while reading this book. Charlie experienced just about everything that can happen to a teen in the course of one school year. He was very emotional throughout the book and his language did not sound like a 14 or 15 year old boy. In fact, when I started reading the book, I thought Charlie was a girl.<br /><br />The friends that Charlie meets during his freshman year of high school were an interesting bunch. I grew up in this era so some references were familiar. My favorite thing was that the two main friends, Sam and Patrick, befriended Charlie despite him being \\"weird\\" or kind of out there. I don't know that that would happen in today's world. I'd like to think that it would and I would hope that this book would inspire that type of friendship (at least the type of friendship that occurred in the beginning...some of it towards the end was inappropriate) today. Sam and Patrick were fun, caring, popular but not in the conventional sense. They were teens of the late 80s trying to find their place in the 90s. I also loved Charlie's English Lit teacher. He really reached out to Charlie and helped him. He challenged him because he saw something in him.<br /><br />I loved that the book was set in Pittsburgh. The tunnel descriptions were spot on. If anyone has ever experienced going through the Fort Pitt tunnels and seeing the city appear before you as you exit, you know how awesome that it. No matter how many times I see that, it still gets me a little bit.<br /><br />I can honestly say that this is one of the few books that I actually liked the movie so much better than the book. I watched The Perks of Being a Wallflower after I read the book. And besides the not so good American accent by Hermione, and the lack of the yinzer accent by all of the actors in this film, the movie was, dare I say, better than the book. It really helped me to visualize what was going on in the book. While reading the book, I could hear the yinzer accent. I really wish the actors in the movie had taken a course in how to speak Pittsburghese. It would have made the whole movie.<br /><br />Would I recommend it: I would recommend this book. It is a different read in some respects. If you are from Pittsburgh, you will totally get the tunnel scenes. If you like edgy YA, then read this.<br /><br />Will I read it again: I will not unless my kids read it when they are older. If that's the case, I may reread it to refresh my memory so I can talk to them about it.opular but not in the conventional sense.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I can't believe that we can live in a culture and society today where we can be so uninformed about the risk and dangers of wheat. It is hard to argue with the story that is presented in this book. I have gone through almost all of the traditional American phases. I read The China Study about two years ago. That changed me, yet I still wasn't losing weight like I thought I would. My blood tests got a lot better, but I still felt that something was missing. After I started working out at a gym earlier this year where I work with trainers, I started seeing where I still had some blind spots. Wheat Belly shined a huge spotlight on those areas. I have been wheat free for a week. I am seeing some improvements, but expect more to come. My chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis is starting to be noticeably diminished. Energy levels are becoming more stable. I don't feel the need for caffeine like I used to. It isn't easy, especially when I go out to eat. Wheat is everywhere. Wheat Belly has equipped me with the knowledge and resolve to eliminate it from my diet once and for all. I wish everyone would at least read this book, so you could make more informed choices about your health and future.

B00BD6KPFU|5.0|If you love them or hate them this show connects you with how a Law Firm works. it quickly introduces each lawyer and their expertise, then shows what they bring to the table and how things are served up. The work that is done to help you or burn you depending on if they are your attorney's or coming after you. The real twist is how different they are away from work. The clients are just as interesting giving you reason to choose how people utilize Lawyer's. Loyalty, intelligence, competence and being human you connect with each attorney from the bottom up. Associates trying to climb the ladder, the assistance/secretary's that protect their boss's very entertaining. i started watching and can't wait for next episode. Remember LA Law all the lawyers , from real estate to divorce. Suits is now in 3rd season 3rd episode and the writers are keeping it fresh definitely addictive. If you like Series like the Wire, Law & Order, House you can watch them over & over and catch things you missed in first viewing. Check it out. I am sure if and when it's over they will have Full Complete series. I am saving my loot to but the full complete series of original Law & Order over 20 seasons. Already purchased all of Criminal Intent.  Check out my review of that series. SVU is still in production so I'll hang back for that one. Hope this was helpful for new viewers and active viewers. Lets not forget a brilliant kid that is performing like a lawyer but is not a lawyer.

B009UZBLSG|3.0|I purchased the Slimport adaptor and BlueRigger HDMI Cable together.  I used them to connect my new Google Nexus 7 FHD tablet to my tv.  In showing a movie, the adaptor and the cable were able to transfer signals to the tv.  However, for unknown reasons, the transfer of signals would stop abruptly.  While the movie was still showing on the tablet, the tv went blank.  After I turned off the tv and turned it back on, signals began to flow again.  This happened four times in showing a two-hour movie last night.  Quite annoying.  Not sure which device is at fault.  Tablet?  Slimport Adaptor?  Cable?  Or, I was unlucky to get a defective adaptor?  Did others experience the same problem?<br />Is the Slimport technology truly superior to the much simpler micro-HDMI to HDMI connection?  The latter does not need an expensive adaptor, just a simple cable.

B00E5BQ9SW|2.0|This movie is so pedestrian that a $7.99 Blu-ray would make more sense.  I do agree that companies like Twilight Time that drive prices up with \\"limited\\" releases need to go, but why would anyone even want a limited edition of a third-rate \\"erotic\\" voyeur movie?<br /><br />If you want something similar that is intricately crafted and memorable, watch Rear Window.  If you want sleaze, watch Strip Nude for Your Killer (or any other giallo - that one just came to mind).  If you want a good DePalma movie, watch Sisters or Dressed to Kill.  Body Double is not particularly alluring or graphic, is not even remotely suspenseful (it's sssslllloooowwww), and contains simply awful acting (aside from Gregg Henry).<br /><br />I own one Twilight Time movie, the original Fright Night from 1985.  I sincerely hope that the company goes out of business or that it never acquires distribution rights for any other movie that I ever want to purchase on Blu-ray.

B0018AJNH2|2.0|I loved Cube, it was an incredibly gripping and stressful movie. Cube Zero helped to answer some of the questions left behind from Cube, however it was basically Cube, with different (bad) actors and much less stress. The acting was so incredibly poor from the character \\"Jax\\" that I spent the majority of the movie making retching noises and begging my television to not show him again, unfortunately my television showed him again and again and again. Consider his character an incredibly low-low rent and spastic version of Christopher Lloyd in a suit and a horrible cybernetic facial prosthetic. This movie is totally worth seeing only if it ever comes available \\"free\\" via Prime. I'm honestly sorry I spent 1.99 on it.

0399255370|4.0|I bought this hoping it would convey some message about not giving up. While it doesn't do that it is a really cute read and the illustrations are amazing!

They sit comfortably on my large melon and the length (and spiral design) of the cord is most convenient without being too obnoxiously long. The build quality feels sturdy enough to last some years, and the ability to reposition the cans to lay on my fiance's pregnant belly to pipe some music to my baby girl was a nice plus.<br />As usual, my experience with Amazon's shipping was AAA+ and it actually arrived before schedule (though I missed the initial UPS delivery while at work).

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My local Best Buy was out of stock after the initial release and by chance I checked online and it said my store had some in stock.  They only had 3 left and to my surprise they were still offering the 3 months of Netflix deal which according to the talk on the internet was no longer available.<br /><br />It's streaming a Netflix movie right now and working great with no wifi interruptions. I messed around with the tabcast and it seems to be working pretty good too although I need more time to put it through it's paces.<br /><br />Is it perfect? No, Obviously they have a ways to go with the app development but I bought this more for the tab cast than anything and considering it costs me $12 after the Netflix deal I can patiently wait for those apps to come plus I have a Roku 3 and between the two should not be wanting.<br /><br />Two things I discovered are #1 if you want to use HDMI cec to turn on and off your Tv you have to use the power adapter and not the usb so the dongle is on all the time and #2 According to Google if you use the dongle extension chord it will increase your wifi reception a little acting as an antena

I like the sound, graphics, video including the 3D version because they are all well edited and put together.  And there is not a lot of cursing in it either.  It is an enjoyable movie.
B008IBPMZG|4.0|Season 2 seemed to fall a bit more into stereotypical soap opera but they still pull it off with aplomb and style. The season-ender was a particularly enjoyable episode and i love watching the original UK version. It's easy to see why so many people love this show
B009DCOU9S|4.0|The levels are well designed and can be difficult but the overall gameplay is well thought out and challenging. The graphics are a little jumbled, but I would will at this game over and over. A GOOD follow up to the original and I hope this franchise continues with several more episodes.
B00340O3KQ|5.0|One of the all time great movies.. Great action, great direction, great performances, great movie. Brings John Woo to Hollywood in a big way. John Travolta and Nicholas Cage are wonderful. Lot of twists and turns in the movie keep you glued to your seat..
B008JFUNYG|5.0|Evil Dead 2013 is a blood soaked gore fest. If you like lots of blood, and violence this one is for you. One person cuts there arm off with a chain saw, another cuts flesh of there face, and one person gets there hand torn off. That isn't even all the bloody parts of this movie, also this movie has a great plot, good actors, and a great story. This is the best movie ever of 2013, and a must have for ture blood hounds of horror movies, I am surprised this film didn't get a unrated rate.
B00338QENI|4.0|Very interesting and informative. A quick read and different than I expected. A lot of science wrapped in a wonderful story.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game has kept my attention longer than most.  Good fun for a few minutes each day.  Would recommend playing.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|I've always wanted to buy this album for years and when I finally got it, it didn't disappoint.  The songs sounds as fresh as when they first came out!
B00011KHTM|5.0|I ordered my macbook on friday. I then realized i needed a converter and a few other peripherals for my normal day tasks. So on monday i ordered this adapter and a mouse. I paid extra for the mouse to have two day shipping which would lead to me receive it today along with my macbook. Instead i found this in my mailbox even though i didnt pay extra and the tracking information didn't expect it for a couple more days. This made me smile and i immediately tested it out and everything is working great. I wanted to let you all know that even the paper that comes with the package says that they strive for five star reviews and that is what i gave them. I will surely be ordering from them in the future!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game is awesome I love it it's fun easy and a very very good distraction I really love it
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I may be getting a little generous with the fourth star, but I love an original distopian Post apocalypse type movie. Tom cruise maintains his usual thetan count and delivers an awesome performance as always. The movie deeply engages the viewer's mind and imagination. Very cool special effects and an incredibly interesting story. But, I found myself with more and more questions and less answers that I felt I was due. Still, good watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app! My daughter will love this! Very realistic as far as I can tell. Definately recommend this game! A+++++++++++++++
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|I am so excited that this works! I put two coats on a pair of black leather gloves and I can use my new iPhone and tablet with no problem.  The paperwork said that it may not work with some screen covers but it works just fine with mine. So glad to have this just before winter when I will have gloves on all the time and I highly recommend to anyone who uses touchscreen devices!
B005LAIHE0|4.0|I would definitely recommend this to someone who is in for a good laugh. 5 years seems too crazy! I liked it!
B0011Z7JRU|5.0|First of all, if someone needs to explain who Led Zeppelin is or, how epic this album is......use all of your might to move the rock you've been hiding under.........in the Rock genre, this is an &#34;all time&#34; must have........period.......
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great, simple to use. I would highly recommend if you are looking for a basic .calculator. Now I'm adding words as filler just to move on.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is my first Jack Reacher story and I enjoyed it very much. It was long, but the story moved along quickly. I WILL be reading the other books very soon-I just hope they're as good as the first.
B00821OX98|4.0|This show I went into as another alien vs human show but the cast and writing is really captivating and enjoyable
B0016J797Q|5.0|He works on his feet for long hrs. He loves these shoes. His size is not easy to find. Another great purchase.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|A very refreshing comedy that let you relive some of your teenage highs and lows. If you have a teenage kid you need to watch this
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Its fun and kind of hard im stuck on one that has a US flag and then a rocket ship. No idea and not enough coins for hints, gahh!<br />But its fun though, if you like games like this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for the new season to begin though I didn't care for the way this season ended. It was too sad!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|i am loving this game and would recommend it to other people and will keep playing it until i complete it
B00C061I3K|4.0|I know a lot of people seem to hate this album for some reason but I find it pretty infectious. I've been listening to Daft Punk since Discovery, and this actually feels more like that album's more mellow side, than much of Daft Punk's straight electronica/club music that has been their recent staple.<br />I suppose if you started liking the group due to their Tron soundtrack/Alive Tour days, this album might seem like it's coming from way out in left field. But if you've been listening to them for this long, I'm not sure you could miss the slow, funky, undercurrents that it's always seemed they wanted more time to explore. Well this is it, and I think its pretty damn groovy.<br />I don't think this album has many songs that are club-ready (without remixes), and that might be a downside to many. But honestly, these songs are an absolutely wonderful, driving, soundtrack for life. I've been listening to this album for days and its great. I don't think I've actually wanted to spend this much time with every track on a Daft Punk album since Discovery.<br />Audio-wise, this album is rich and clear. Daft Punk are masters of their craft from a technical standpoint.<br />If you are really on the fence, sample some of the work from a streaming service of some sort. But don't believe the people hating on this album. It just didn't hit them right (nobody likes everything), and they are reveling in their chance to bash something popular. (and I can respect that)<br /><br />It's a catchy, well put-together experience. And it's going to seem a lot of service in my collection.
B00DCX08MW|4.0|Overall a fun game. It is pretty easy to figure out the controls, it would be nice to have more levels though.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I really enjoyed this show.  The stories were really good, and the characters were well-developed.  I enjoyed watching all the actor's performances.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Ok.  You can upgrade faster by spending real money but who wants to do that. It just takes a lot longer to do if you use game money.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|I like this game.  Good way to wind down at the end of the day.  If you can add, and think logically, you should have no problem.  I've only done the 5*5 and 6*6 games so far, but will be moving on to more challenging levels soon.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|good game but I didn't get to get to far before I had to buy the full version.  I thought the cost was a little much though.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I love this cd, have it on my i-pod that i listen to at work.  The music is fun and makes me smile
B002SRQ214|5.0|This CPU is amazing! Wow! I have over-clocked this thing 400mhz faster than its rated speed (3400mhz) of course I am using water cooling (Corsair H100 a very good cooler by the way) with zero issues, it is amazing, check it out on the web this is a very popular CPU!
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|Very nice Sudoku game.  Well laid out,and play is smooth.  The only gripe I have is that when you complete a section and the numbers starts spinning,you can't touch the next square,this has caused me to accidentally hit the wrong number.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game my only dislike is the fact that you cant go to deep in the water and that's where all the big high scoring fish and sharks are at
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book because of all the twist. I think it's a great read. Recommended!!! Be prepared not to put it down.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|probably the best book I've read this year. As with Hosseini's other novels it is deep, but this one seems perhaps more involved in individuals lives. It involves 3 generations. One single choice starts the story; that event affects several peoples lives for the generations to come. The reader becomes acquainted with several individuals with some lives ending poorly but in the end there is a kind of peace.<br />Excellent book
B00CEK9OTM|3.0|Title says it all. Some may find this type of game fun,but by level three or four,it just seemed pointless.  Not the type of game I like.  The graphics very very nice,and I like the fact that there were no ads or outrage is permissions needed,more developers should take a cue from them.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This would helpful to look up a words meaning in school to help me when I forget what a word means.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Wonderful from beginning to end...very intense...I recommend this movie to anyone! The characters really grow with you and you fall in love with them and are cheering for them the entire time!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I remember watching &#34;The Adventures of Robin Hood&#34; with Errol Flynn, when I was just a little girl in grad school. It was the only version of the Rodin Hood story I knew. As I grew older, and more and more versions of the Robin Hood story came out. I held true to the classic! When our young neighbor, (he's 4 years old) decided HE was going to be Robin Hood, I asked his parents, what made him come to this important decision? They said he just finished watching Robin Hood on the telly, and he IS Robin Hood. I quickly remarked:&#34;AWWWW Errol Flynn at his best!&#34;. They had NO idea what I was talking about. They had shown their young son, the &#34;Disney&#34; version. I told them, I had a copy of &#34;The Adventures of Robin Hood&#34; with Errol Flynn and  Olivia de Havilland ! THESE PEOPLE NEVER HEARD OF THIS COPY!!!!! I was on a quest.. I must educate my young neighbors. I told them they could borrow my copy! But when I returned home, I found I no longer had a copy. I quickly got on Amazon, saw that they had a copy, and yes they could over night ship!!!! YAHOO! I splurged and ordered the Two-Disc Special Edition. As promised, it was delivered over night. (This was a first for me) I was in great condition, I quickly dropped the disc into our DVD player. And my husband & I had an &#34;In Home Date Night&#34;. My husband declared, the Errol Flynn version of Robin Hood, was appropriate for a 4 year old. I let our young neighbors borrow it. And much to their dismay ..their young son was no longer &#34;Robin Hood, the Disney Fox..&#34; But &#34;Robin Hood, Errol Flynn!  Thank you, for helping me educate the younger generation in the Classics!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for all those little girls that always wanted a horse but could never have one, without all the hard work and mess.  Love this app, my daughter probably will too.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Got this for my wife since everyone was talking about the show. I have enjoyed it and recently ordered season 3 so we can be up to date when #4 arrives next year. Great acting, staging, cinematography. If you haven't followed Downton Abbey get started.
B0027MJU00|5.0|With an ending that's much more satisfying that Gone Girl! But I don't think I have the stomach to reach Sharp Objects.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|First thing I look at in the morning locally. And different cities.  Can joke w friends about how flood our weather is
B000SUKPKM|5.0|Saw them in concert July, 10 and forgot how great of a band they are. After seeing them live this was a must own. If you're a fan and don't have it yet, get it! You won't be disappointed.
0920668372|1.0|...How Creepy This book is. I thought it was very weird, why are people saying how good this is? i don't get. It Leaves you feeling awful, probley because it is creepy and Deppressing. I found it too sad to be touching, and no one even listens to what people have to say. people talk about this book  like the bible or Somthing. the ladder part Is really creepy. and the end is sad. the very end and the very begnning are the touching parts. very sad and creepy book.
1478951508|4.0|I am one of those who read HP on-time (I think I was about 10 when the first HP book got big). I enjoyed the series, although in the end I started to feel it got a little too battle-friendly. I enjoyed the boarding school atmosphere the same way I enjoyed Enid Blyton and Tom Brown as a child, not magic battles. I'd go to other authors for that.<br /><br />That being said, I read The Casual Vacancy, and I can see why there are almost equal amounts of 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 star reviews. Let me explain.<br /><br />The premise is an English town. Middle-class town. Small. This is different from any other country's \\"small town\\", and it may be difficult for, say, an American small-town dweller to understand the underlying emotional currents that moves throughout the book. It may also be difficult for those who have not attended (or have children who have attended) British comprehensive secondary schools to understand just what is going on amongst the children. It is not supposed to be bloody. It's not supposed to have shoot-outs. It's also not supposed to be dramatic, because English people do not like \\"drama\\". Sure, we have drama - all people do - but \\"hanging on in quiet desperation\\" is the English way. Calmly observing a suicide would be the English way (a la Evelyn Waugh). A detached observation of the macabre is the English style in my opinion, such as Anthony Burgess or Graham Greene. It is not supposed to make anyone a villain or a hero.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a clear black and white, then this book isn't for you. If you are looking for heroism and \\"I tried hard and I succeeded\\" story, this isn't for you either. If you do not really have a life-shattering problem in your life but feel that something somewhere went wrong and want to read about that, this book is for you.<br /><br />The book does not deal with starvation, serious abuse (I'm talking about The Child Called It level here), rape (Colour Purple level), but rather deals with the enclosed, seemingly peaceful society that is rotting from the core. It's not a \\"fun\\" read. It's not supposed to \\"move\\" you. But it does deal with all the ugliness that we, as a society, tend to close eyes to: covert racism, neglect, rape, drug abuse, societal elitism, the middle-class \\"it's not happening to me so I'll close my eyes\\" attitude that leaves people like Krystal Whedon behind. We donate money, talk about these people as numbers, but very rarely do we face them individually, and even more rarely do we actively do something against it. \\"I feel bad but I do have my life\\" is the general tone, which presents as a duality that permeates this novel. It deals with the superficial peace and the torrent of strife that dwells beneath.<br /><br />The children, much rawer than the adults, shove those dualities into the adults' faces. This seems more evident amongst comprehensive schools, but you really have to \\"feel\\" - not know, but feel - the British class system in order to see the gross dichotomy. But the children are also without direction and while trying their best to live as they see fit, they do not know the core truths to the values they are petitioning for. Family is important - but Krystal does not know why. Honesty is precious - but Fats can't tell between \\"honesty\\" and \\"selfishness\\". Maintaining peace is crucial - but Simon does not know when to speak up and when to accept, possibly because they are \\"taught\\" that these values are precious and important, but do not know (or think) about why.<br /><br />To those who are considering purchasing this book, I suggest reading this not as a \\"novel\\", but rather social criticism. It might be difficult for the non-English to empathise with any character in this book, due to the lack of experiences. (I went to an independent and lived in a fairly large town, so I found it a little difficult to empathise as well... I don't \\"feel\\" the enclosedness of Pagford, as it's 30 minutes to London from where I used to live.) But this book does deal with many social problems that are half-heartedly addressed but aren't really focused on in today's society (a lot of issues that get raised in this book seem to get \\"yeah yeah, old story\\" reactions when you actually try to discuss it). So the book does do a good job on that aspect.<br /><br />All in all, 4 stars. It does a good job portraying the English town to English people, but it probably won't translate to those outside the Isles.
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|I do not understand how anyone can negatively review this project. I guess that is the nice part of our \\"democracy\\" is that everyone can safely have an opinion. However, in my humble opinion it is easily 5 stars and deserves what ever accolades it receives.
B00821OX98|5.0|Fantastic and well written show. It was totally captivating and had us on the edge of our seats the whole time!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|And it is actually free to play. No strings attached and none of that greedy &#34;pay or you cannot even try&#34; B.S.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This was a good read. I found it to be an interesting story and well written. Light, good story book.
B00E8B1358|3.0|...subject says it all. It was certainly an entertaining movie, just didn't feel much like G.I. Joe to me. I kept waiting for the part where Duke came back and kicked butt, never happened.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|This game didn't run on my Samsung Infuse.  I don't think I was going to like it anyway, but if a game doesn't even run, I can't hate it for not running.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|As the title suggests, it's a great way to pass the time. Stuck in a line somewhere, run the app and when you can't solve the puzzle ask for help from strangers :). Rated only 4 stars because it only has 10 floors. Looking forward to more floors and more from this company.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I don't think the acting is all that great, but I would still recommend it.  This show is fabulous!  I love it!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Just what I need it. Really. Do not pay extra with other brands. It even won over Wal Mart in the price. It was cheaper by 20 to 25 dollars. Really I went all over to compare prices in different wal marts. A lot of room and Camera will be safe. I even pack my handy cam from sony of course including my D3100 with two lenses and chargers.
B00A757EFW|3.0|This is Pac-Man.  I'm going to pad the review now because everyone downloading games should already have an idea of how they feel about Pac-Man already.  My saying it is revolutionary or simplistic isn't really going to matter.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Captures you, keeps you, makes you wonder who ISN'T a follower. Highly recommend picking up on this engaging thriller with its dark under- and over-tones
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and easy to get started. Enjoyed taking care of the horses. Gems are hard to achieve though. Awesome app though. Easy for kids to take care of the horses.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but I so like this game that I am taking the time to do so.  It's challenging and fun.  The only game I actually enjoy more with the sound on than off.  A well-designed app.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|The boys love this game.  Engaging and entertaining!  When you reach different levels, you can change clothing and car accessories.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun game, it makes you think about how to solve the puzzles.  Works your mind.  I had a lot of fun solving the clues.
1400052181|5.0|I had an emotional ride with this account of what this young lady went through. And now the family was in the news about how this information of their relative can be shared. Great story in history, part of this women is helping research physician solve some of the cancer problems.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game  is fun and addictive... makes trips and waiting rooms go by fast! No problems that I know of or have had.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Once you understand how to play its pretty cool. I feel like there's not much to do without spending gems or coins though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is almost as real as it gets!!! I just wish there were more years and food with energy for the horses and I also wish there was a palomino horse
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Who would thought I would be so interested about the weather when I was away from home. I found access fascinating and loved following it as I traveled.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Absolutely love this book! Hilarious, fun, easy to read! Wasn't the biggest Tina Fey fan until I read this- loved her insight and humor
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Thats the definitive question. I didn't even know about firefly until the movie Serenity came out. You have super B rated shows getting a boatload of publicity, and good airing times not against the top shows, and a hodge-podge of actors that don't meld & they get 3 or 4 years.<br />But with Firefly, you had an immpecable, believable, cast with a great story line & brilliant writers , &I to this day I meet people all the time who never heard of it. SyFy you blew this one, BIG TIME.
0307476073|2.0|While Strayed is a beautiful writer, so many parts of her book are just not believable, especially to folks who actually do long-distance trekking.  I also found that I didn't like her much as a person because of all the collateral damage she left in her life, essentially using or being unfair to really good people who wished to help her.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This was a fun quick read that had me from th first few pages. I have now read two more from this author and love them too!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very good game. fun for everyone. I love minions and this game is prefect. they should make the first one.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|After being exited about the application, it dawned on me that 3G signals do not transmit fast enough to where you can accomplish much. So I deleted the AP to avoid even trying to use it. The AP was fine when you use Wi-Fi, but very slow otherwise. The search content and results are very different from non mobile results.
B000HKYA1I|5.0|This is one of my favorite films. It's almost surrealistic, with quirky, flawed-but-lovable characters, great cinematography and music. Tackles serious subject matter in a touching, heartwarming and ultimately charming way.<br /><br />I read the book after watching the movie and realized how much was left out of the screenplay -- and yet, I think the movie is perfect.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|First to answer the big question. Yes there is. I had a very similar but less traumatic experience myself and I agree with this description of life after death. To be clear I have seen the same thing that Anita describes here. As for the book, it reads very well. I thought at first that there was too much time devoted to Anita's background. In the end I found that this information was helpful in making a complete picture of Anita and her amazing experience.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this is a good game because it is very kid friendly and you could play it all day on any device
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|amazing game. I'm 30yrs old n I play this game everyday. great graphics. n its free. just wish the upgrade had not changed the price of upgrades. n u no longer have anything to buy with the bananas. if those 2 things were fixed I would give it 5 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game! It takes all the fun from the 2 movies and puts it right into the game! I would recommend this to all aged!
1781162646|5.0|Can't stop reading the book. Kings writing makes me feel like I am there. Well written and captivating. As always
B005ZUR724|4.0|Order and chaos is a good mmorpg. Great graphics and plenty of playability. Down side to the game is the down time with the servers. Glitches with enemy's. But to be honest it's well worth the buy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fantastic game. Graphics are stunning and the puzzles are just tricky enough to be fun but never frustrating.<br />It is relatively short, but worth every minute.
1490313370|5.0|I could not put this book down! I simply couldn't stop reading it, so I just gave up sleep and inhaled it. It's tender and touching and real and raw all in the same bite.  At times, the story is painful and I could relate to the exhausting angst that haunts the failed entrepreneur in the dark of night, when their entire kingdom lies in smoking ruins. As a business person, I empathized with the experience of stark terror a person experiences alone in the dark at 3 AM knowing the world is coming to an end when the sun comes up. He says, \\"There is no way out. There is no way out.\\" It's a familiar emotional mantra chanted by many of us struggling at those time of crisis when our life situation self-destructs.<br /><br />The book does something else as well- it offers a vision of a hopeful future for those alert enough to read the tea leaves. So far, it doesn't look like the jobs are coming back to America, which means that we will all need to invent new ways to create value and earn a living in our new economic landscape. His ideas are not new. The United States was founded by individuals who saw a need and figured out how to fill it. I believe he is completely correct that we have entered the CHOOSE YOURSELF era and he offers his ideas to navigate this new financial terrain. Even if the reader has a good job now, the information in the book offers the reader a tangible process to navigate their career in the business world. Well worth the read.<br /><br />My personal high point of the book was when I read, \\"I am grateful.\\" He goes on to describe the tremendous power of practicing gratitude on a daily basis. Failing at almost everything myself, I've learned to be grateful for everything as well. My Altucher's words on gratitude were affirming and comforting. Most good book will teach you something. A great book will reach out, grab your heart, and infuse it with new blood and new life. \\"CHOOSE YOURSELF\\" is that kind of book!
B002O2THRO|5.0|I Love this movie. I wanted to re watch this version before I see the new release. It never disappoints.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I've read this book three times. Moving and can't stop reading it at times. This book puts me at a different perspective.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Wow I would totally recommend this game to other people. The storyline is the best I've seen and it keeps me hooked
B0070Y46UY|3.0|It was interesting at first but very dry and uneventful. I could not finish it as I kept falling asleep. I usually read mysteries and thought this would be a nice change but it wasn't for me.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Regardless of your age, you will love this movie.  True magic.  You will watch it again and again!  I can't wait for number 2 and even then I am certain to want more!!!!  Has moved to the top of my favorites list.  Enjoy!  Kim (age 50)
B0036UMM84|5.0|A Star is Born with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson were perfect as the couple, who he had it all and gave her, her chance to have what he had with being a Super Star, but in the end he gets left on the side lines and the ending is devastating from the Original two movies of A Star is Born everyone was well worth watching as each fell in different eras of America's time and place in our past history, as this one in now part of our past history of the 70's with Drugs, Rock'n Roll and being unable to handle the fame that came to them.<br /><br />Watch and learn from each of the three movies made of a Star is Born it is worth seeing how each story reflects the time it was made in and the stars where as good as Streisand and<br />Kristofferson were in this adaptation of a Star is Born, a great Friday or Saturday night Love story of the late 70's times.  Below is the link to the movie, enjoy:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0036UMM84 B0036UMM84]]
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Five star<br />Bjoanneway.man@Yahoo.com.  Thesebooks are great.  Anyone that has medical knowledge  ,Ithink  would  find  it  diff.  To put down. Can't wait for the  next  . One

B003AVPV1O|5.0|What more do you want as far as a description for a review.  It takes one signal and distributes that one signal to two separate display devices.
B008JFUO36|2.0|As a life-long fan of SciFi it is virtually impossible not to love Oblivion as a state-of-the art visual treat. My only dilemma - is it really possible to like it as a film? For many reasons, I remain conflicted. Without question the SFX are nonpareil, offering a visually stunning depiction of a circa 2077 discarded, dystopian earth now being harvested for its remaining natural resources. The population long since decamped to one of Saturn's moons Titan, leaving a skeleton crew of Sentinels to monitor the extraction machinery and exterminate the rag-tag remains of the \\"Scavs\\" who had invaded earth in the 2020's setting off our doomsday spiral. So far so good, especially the performance of Tom Cruise who as \\"Jack,\\" the sentinel with soul, has remarkably shed his trademarked action-hero disaffection and glowering for something they used to call acting back in the 20th century.<br /><br />Honestly, I'd be engaged as well if Jack's George Jetson meets Paul Blart blue collarness allowed me to survey the planet from the ultimate, coolest penthouse ever conceived for film - a 25,000 foot suspended aerie complete with an infinity pool that is literally just that.<br /><br />Consequently, the first 45 minutes of the film is pure CGI perfection. Desiccated Super Bowl stadia lie in ruins, Petrified, post-nuclear city scapes abound, drying sea beds are littered by rusted husks of oil tankers and cruise ships taunting us with the smug nostalgia of how great we had it back in 2015....<br /><br />...now comes the hard part, telling a story that can stand-alone from the visual pyrotechnics. In the case of Oblivion, the narrative skills of the director, Joseph Kosinski and screenwriters, Karl Gagdusek and Michael Arndt, conspire to near failure, all too frequently relying on story elements that seem arbitrary and implausible.<br /><br />Forget the Scavs and the political machinations on Titan, in an out of nowhere twist, \\"Jack\\" has discovered a radiation free, paradise valley that he regularly visits to lay back on the grass, fly-fish in a lake fully stocked with trout and boogie to an epic but very ancient stereo system whose turntable is constantly fed by a huge collection of near pristine 1970's classic rock vinyl that must have once belonged to Cruise's pal Cameron Crowe.<br /><br />All around him the steel and rock from a wrecked civilization have been fused into apocalyptic sculpture but please be assured that the 110 year old Pet Sounds album cover is completely intact. An unforgivable stretch in logic even for a film that constantly begs it from you.<br /><br />While I suspect this device is utilized to anchor the story for a contemporary audience, seeing Cruise in his Adirondack chair, sporting a faded Yankees cap while getting off on the Allman Brothers is a WTF bridge-too-far for a story-line that is already crammed and conflicted - in fact this entire arc was so strange, I fully expected Gene Kelly to show up in the next scene asking for directions to Brigadoon.<br /><br />All in all Oblivion is a VISUAL masterpiece that must be seen. However, with the exception of a haunting score by M.8.3 you could just as easily lament that this deeply flawed script was ever made into a Talkie. Too bad, because Tom Cruise actually tried in this one.
B002RRWWQ4|1.0|We rented this video in HD from Amazon Prime. The movie seemed great but the streaming server stopped and RESTARTED the movie 3 or 4 times during viewing. I had come to expect better streaming performance from Amazon after earlier movies and television viewing.<br /><br />I have plenty of bandwidth coming into the house and the Amazon stream was the only thing active at the time.<br /><br />Disappointing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|simple and easy to use with digital features that make sense like keeping a history. big buttons are nice and the app uses the screen well
B0028R3NCU|2.0|problem with this one is that it is fine if you slot it in your laptop but if you put it in your pocket the sides eventually compress so it won't accept microsd cards going in and out.  I would never use this as a portable card reader, the one that has a tiny case is better
B003VANOFY|4.0|The headset is comfortable and provides good sound. There is clearly position information in the sound, but I'm not running software that provides a 3D experience, so I haven't heard it yet. They do exactly what I bought them for. One star off, because the software does not match the documentation.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Being over at he'd in Court is every trial lawyer's fear.  Grisham portrays a small firm up against a mega law machine.  The hero eventually rises up to the challenge. A fun read.
B00DCX08MW|4.0|Loads of fun with two separate flight characteristics available . The graphics had to be set to medium in order to realize smooth and fluid play with my kindle fire HD.
0920668372|3.0|Got this for my cousin as a baby shower gift. I she lost it and was so excited. So take this review as you wish
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love this game.  And you can't beat the price I got it for.  Many levels for hours of fun.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I had seen this movie ,step up revolution before, wanted it and this was in perfect condition ,well satisfied with it.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|This is definitely one of the more inspiring books I have read in my life. It's 'a cancer book without being a book about cancer'. I think this novel is worth reading no matter your age or gender. It is sure to be a classic and well remembered in years to come.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Like its simplicity. The tones won't wake me up stressed, but gradually and in a refreshing way. If you want to wake up, this is your app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Overall, an excellent game that improves upon its predecessor, Temple Run. Absolutely incredible graphics. Like the fact that Usain Bolt is a character in Temple Run 2.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. It was fun and challenging but not to challenging. I could figure out most of the games without help, but there were a few I needed some hints. The artwork was really amazing and  made the game even more fun. I only give this four stars because there were some glitches on my Kindle Fire. Sometimes it was almost impossible to pick up items and place them where they were supposed to go. I had to really concentrate and try several times to get some things to work. Hopefully the makers of this game will fix that.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The storyline is written well enough to hold your interest. The strategy required to solve the mystery of Maple Creek is neither too easy nor too complicated. The mini games (mini puzzles) are sometimes intuitive and sometimes require instructions or a hint. The hidden objects provide just the right level of challenge.<br /><br />Note that the names of hidden objects may not always be what you might expect. For example, &quot;fan&quot; can refer to a Japanese fan used by women or an electric fan with blades that spin. Also note that the hidden objects may be actual items hidden in the room or sketched drawings of the items cleverly camouflaged on other items in the room.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|Jake Gyllenhal and Anne Hathaway back together after &#34;Brokeback Mountain&#34;.  They're a great combo and they did an excellent job in this movie.  I wouldn't say I loved it but I definitely really liked it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of my favorite books. Read it in two weeks and wanted more! It is a young adult novel but as a full grown adult, it was engaging to me as well.
1577314808|3.0|I must say this book is a great read, especially if you suffer from anxiety or depression.  However, i still don't feel like i have \\"awakened\\" or I am free. Perhaps Tolle could of explained a bit more on \\"how\\" to do some of the things in the book.  But then again, he does say \\"there is nothing you can do\\" to be 'present'.  It just sounds too good to be true to me at a lot of points in the book. I feel like this book comes across as a \\"cure all\\" or an answer to all problems and i'm not \\"getting\\" it.. perhaps I'm frustrated about that.  anyone have any feedback?
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This game is definitely a challenge on the ol brain. Some of these puzzles have had me stumped for ages! I do enjoy this game, but I can only play when I have time to sit and concentrate for a while!
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss created some of the most compelling characters in modern fantasy with his The Name of the Wind, and The Wise Man's Fear returns us to the world of Kvothe/Kote and his companions in a fitting sequel. While the first book was excellent, this one manages to be even more addictive, so make sure you've got a few hours free before you start!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|From the young boys perspective, it takes a few chapters to get used to his &#34;talk,&#34; but keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|It was great and very enjoyable. It was easy to get lost in their story and world. Definitely five thumbs up!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I am addicted to this game! It is so mindless to play when I just can't seem to fall asleep but I'm too tired to do anything else. The levels are pretty easy to get through so far, but if you are aiming to collect every gem in every level then it makes it much more challenging.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Great movie and worth watching. A lot of action scenes and really funny. Definitely worth the money spent on this.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Harry Bosch books are the best.  The only problem I have is that there aren't enough of them.  As far as I am, concerned, Michael Connelly cannot write fast enough! I am so hooked on Harry Bosch.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was amazing never there a dull moment a unique situation of love happiness and kids sticking together no matter what each other looked like :):):)
0920668372|5.0|Awesome book and message. Read this the first time to my son 27 years ago and then we read it to my daughter 3 years later. I still get tears while reading it today!
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I love hiking trips because they cause you to think and reflect on your life and where you are going. When Cheryl Strayed is reflecting on her past and who she is, this book is wonderfully thought-provoking;  however, there are too many times when Strayed is just a girl with daddy issues thinking about man after man, or she is showing  once again what an incompetent and whiny hiker she is.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Easy to figure out but challenging without being frustrating.  I had to play some levels multiple times to get all the hidden gems and I think there will still be replay value when I get all the way to the end.  There is a lot of variety between each of the levels so not too repetitive.  The graphics are great and the monkey animations cute without being annoying.  I like the untimed challenge best (I panic during a timer :)) but there is a choice.  I just like to unwind with this game when I want to burn 5 or 10 minutes.  More worlds please.  Update:  I guess all good things really do have to end.  When I played the last level of the untimed challenges, the game would not let me replay anything - even the other timed challenges I hadn't even tried yet.  I still had fun until then and I'm sure with an uninstall and reinstall it will reset.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|While there is nothing in this book that scholars have not been saying for some time, it was nice to find it in an easy to read and popular format.  The author reminds me a bit of Bishop Spong in his desire to bring the truth to the masses of believers and rescue religion from superstition.  No doubt ignorant people will attach Aslan for all sorts of reasons unrelated to his scholarship, but that is the price for telling the truth these days.  He uses very good and highly regarded sources -- evidenced in the notes.  In fact, use of his sources will lead the serious inquirer to continue to learn more about Jesus.<br /><br />it's about time that we rescue  Jesus from those who pander to the religious establishment and let his followers revel in the truth about this remarkable man.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I was looking for a Youtube app/downloader because regular internet didn't give you HD videos so I saw this app, got it, and now I watch all my videos here on this app. The quality is great, the connection is fast, and the ads are nowhere to be seen except when I see the bottom part. The virus ads can get annoying though, please remove THAT. I am not a friend of the maker, so I am here on my own accord and I say this app may be the best one there is for Youtube  :)
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|Very, very vibrant colors with the Blu Ray version. The movie is a great precursor for the Wizard of Oz.
B000002A46|5.0|This CD is my very favorite for Christmas and even into Feb and March. Mariah's voice is amazing. This is on CD that I manage to keep up with from year to year.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|It's rare to see movies anymore where you can't predict what is going to happen, have crazy twists and are somewhat complex. The graphics and special effects are superb. The acting is very well done as well. I do wish there were more quality films out there like this!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|LIke this series, it is what it us, one of the best pure scifi series there is. Don't expect deep story lines even though there is good content.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved all these books can't wait to see the last two parts of the movies! I do wish there was more of these books, very happy to have finished them but sad I don't have anymore to read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The characters come across as very authentic, the plot is always dramatic, and the counterpoint humor so fitting. Love it!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Galaxy S4. Images won't save or post to Facebook which are the only two options. Would potentially be nifty but without save seems worthless.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The movie followed the context for awhile and then the Hollywood interpretation concepts kicked in. No other-worldly concepts found in the book and scant indication of reincarnation mentioned. Other than that, a good read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app was really fun and if u like adventure then this is the app that u would want to get and play
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Just purchased The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary, 2 CD set.  As The Beach Boys are my all time favorite band I have to say that this live CD sounds so much better than the previous ones; Beach Boys Concert, Live in London, Beach Boys In Concert and Live at Knebworth 1980. I agree with one of the other reviews, and that they should release a complete DVD of the concert.  I own the one that came out last year only because I got it as a Christmas present.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The movie gave me something to do for the night but it wasn't spectacular.  If you have nothing better to do it is worth watching, but you will probably be able to predict the ending.
0545265355|5.0|Daughter read entire series in a week!  Passed books to friends and family. Makes a great gift for every one!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room at first seems like a simple game easy to beat. However the puzzles become very complex that you may find yourself frustrated. Nonetheless it immerses you into the puzzles to see where all of this leads up to.  Although it is a bit short for a puzzle game the journey through solving these puzzles was so worth it. Honestly I can say it is worth the 2 bucks. Also it is compatible with the kindle fire hd now.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|I was just looking for some new music to add to my collection & stumbled on this one... Lyrics are fun & the beat is easy to gyve to.
B00866JL96|5.0|zac efron was great i try to get all of his movies they are so weppy and lovable and cry more toward the end
B002M5E2DW|4.0|This book has a lot of life lessons. It teaches  you to listen to your inner feelings. You attract things an  events to your own self by attitude and intuition. You can do anything you set your mind to.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|They say I have a update but when I go into settings and hit update it say don't have one how do you update this game? And need more energy then 50
B001NLKS16|3.0|This is written as John's diary with a little bit of research thrown in.  According to how the show presents the journal, it should be exactly the opposite:  a research journal with a little bit of context tossed around.  I'm only 1/3 through Season 2 (just started a few days ago), and I already noticed some glaring differences.  The illustration on the Wendigo page isn't the same; photos and other such attached paraphernalia are missing.  Considering this is an official adaptation, I will say that I was disappointed.  However, it was fun to peek inside Papa Winchester's head a little.
B009WHDE3C|5.0|i loved the charters it is funny sad and eventful and weepy and much needed friends it was great the charters were great
B002W5UVSM|5.0|Very unique, weird characters that interact with one another in a distinctly New Orleans way.  You will enjoy! And probably want to visit New Orleans.  Beware of reading in public, you may become hysterical.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|great app.  easy step by step instruction &amp; soon you're on your way to great edits, filters &amp; more. makes your basic shots look professional.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|Awesome game for the kids. But a lot of trouble keeping the level that you reached and can not get the information back. Daughter on level 20 lost all had to start all over. Also hard time getting back into face book to add her friends again. Still not able to do that. Can not purchase gems, coins, and treats says I have no payment info had added it several times.
B00004XQ83|5.0|It is a very nice condition, and the songs are great.  It makes for great listening in car or home.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|One of the funniest and interesting writers you will ever read. Great observations on people and life's absurdities.  For a good time, check out Sedaris' videos on YouTube. Sooooooooo funny.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|As usual excellent book, three stories in one book, but not quite up to previous books with a single story.
B00006AW2G|5.0|The old ABKCO disc sounded pretty decent, but the London was a notable  upgrade, taken from a tape significantly closer to source.      In a similar case to that of Beggars Banquet, the new ABKCO disc is taken from a  tape that seemingly hasn't been used before. Older CD editions had a good bit of  \\"bleedthrough\\" in the stereo spectrum. For example, listen to the start of \\"Love in Vain.\\"  On older discs, the right channel clearly has a good deal of the left channel in it, albeit  \\"muted\\" (a sure sign that this is a slightly mis-aligned tape copy). On the newer disc,  however, the right channel is almost silent, and one can hear some sort of rhythmic  thumping in the background. The new ABKCO is also slightly compressed (made  obvious by out-of-phase analysis of the album), but this is a moot point, as the upgrade in  tape generation is well worth the little bit of compression.      Oddly, Let It Bleed shares a similar problem with the new Beggars Banquet. \\"You  Can't Always Get What you Want\\" is slightly extended at the beginning, but the left  channel has some noticeable wobble for the first few seconds of the song (this might have  been on older copies, but disguised by the channel bleed-through). On the plus side, one  can now clearly identify what's playing under the very beginning of the guitar-intro of the  song: Midnight Rambler! It plays until the horn comes in for the first time, and then there  is an audible \\"click\\" as it disappears.
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|Got into prog rock heavily this year and gave this a try--- very good--- get the bonus disc too. 4 STARS
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Martin Freeman is GORGEOUS!!<br /><br />Okay, he's a smidge on the short side, but I loved his performance in this movie.
0812993845|2.0|Usually Ms. K's books are funny, and fast paced with wry humor and some scathing commentary. No they are not great literature; but usually a really good read that makes takes you away and makes you chuckle. This one is like cotton candy past it's prime--- sort of gooey, unformed, sticky mess with characters dripping everywhere. I have read all her previous books and truly enjoyed the Shopaholic series and others. Esp. loved \\"Twenties Girl\\" which was well written, researched, wistful and humorous. This one is just plodding, humorless and self absorbed. I was looking forward to a summer escape but this dreary, dim witted, demi-downer is going back to the library.
B00006EXDM|4.0|As compared to the London, the new ABKCO set presents a cross-section of   upgrades, unchanged tracks, and a few disappointments. Disc 1 presents stereo mixes of   everything but \\"Play With Fire,\\" \\"Get Off Of My Cloud,\\" \\"As Tears Go By,\\" \\"Mother's   Little Helper\\" and \\"19th Nervous Breakdown.\\" Of these, a few do in fact differ from their   London counterparts. \\"Heart of Stone\\" is the variation/upgrade discussed in the song   listings section and the Now! entry. \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" is in fact what appears   to be a reasonably-recent remix (ABKCO claims that it was made in the sixties, but the   mixing approach seems to contradict that). Instead of the wide separation that marked the   London version, this one is near-mono, with most of the \\"stereo\\" deriving from the   acoustic guitar, which is split between channels. This version also has high-end, which   the London version notably lacked. \\"Paint It, Black\\" is also in some ways better than the   London version, as its EQ more closely matches the EQ of the original, stereo vinyl   version (the London version, by contrast, was somewhat murky and indistinct). It has its   silent-channel \\"blacked out\\" during the intro, but that isn't too terribly distracting. Of the   remaining stereo tracks on disc 1, \\"Under My Thumb\\" is the slightly-processed version   from Aftermath (the hiss \\"comes up\\" when the vocals enter), \\"Let's Spend the Night   Together\\" is the usual stereo version, and \\"Ruby Tuesday\\" is the incorrect mix discussed   in detail in the song-listing section and under the Between the Buttons entry.    The London Hot Rocks, by contrast to the original ABKCO, is a sonic delight, and offers a few never-  before-heard mixes; while \\"Satisfaction,\\" \\"Play With Fire,\\" and \\"Get Off of My Cloud\\"  are in mono on the individual London discs of Heads and December's Children, they're in  extreme, wide-stereo here. \\"Satisfaction,\\" in particular, is very different from the mono  mix; it runs slightly faster, and the acoustic instruments are emphasized by being  essentially isolated in the right channel. It does suffer from a slight lack of top-end,  though.
B0055S348W|5.0|I am now able to print to my HP p1102w laser printer.  It prints quickly and gives many options to print from, including emails.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is different than any other Near-Death Experience (NDE)I have read.  I found the scientific view fascinating, the research referenced in the book.  Clearly, the author, a scientist himself, needed to interpret his experience in order to understand what NDE's could mean to scientific research.  Anyone interested in NDE, consciousness, neuroscience could enjoy this book.
B000FC12YQ|5.0|Contrary to popular belief, this does not break the rules of the genre. Rather, it masterfully skirts them through a series of well-concealed loopholes. A classic exercise in point of view and subtext, it is essential reading for anyone interested in (trying their own hand at) a *certain kind of narrator.*
B0052REUW0|5.0|Every few thousand years, a book comes along which changes the course of human evolution. I have no idea if that describes this book, but it should. Obstensibly, this book merely seeks to prove the statement that violence has declined (Pinker eradicates all traces of doubt with a dehibilitating salvo of logic that makes &#34;Shock and Awe&#34; look like a United Nations chess club). Along the way, however, Pinker also manages to utterly destroy practically every flawed ideology holding back our scientific and social progress. From the bizarrely misguided backlash against science after World War II, to the unintended consequences of the new left's assault on order and tradition, Pinker will savagely slap you with statistics until your intellect chafes raw, but you will beg for more.<br /><br />The analysis of the civilizing process following the Middle Ages, as mindblowing numb as that sounds, proved to be a mindf*** a minute. I was reduced to a blithering mess of blown neurons, barely sentient for hours, until I re-emerged as a new man, pure as the driven snow.<br /><br />If everyone in the world read this book, and then everyone who did not enjoy it was sterilized, the world would be a better place. Please read. Now.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Ordered this from the play store the right after I watched the Google announcement. This thing is borderline magical. This is what tech is all about. I have tried all the existing apps from the phone and they are seamless. Just put the Chromecast app on your phone and any app that supports it like Netflix and Google play Music get an added icon for casting. Click the Cast icon and its playing on your TV. If your TV is newer, it works even better because the TV input will automatically switch to the HDMI port of the Chromecast.<br />For Computers Just download the chromecast App and your good to go. For apps that are not native, you can use the Chrome browser and push your screen to the Chrome cast. Here is the slick part that isn't even talked up by Google. I keep all my media on a server, my home videos, pictures, music and my movie collection are all accessible from the netwrok. Well Google has made it possible for that collection to be shown/played on every TV in the house. You can just drag and drop files into the Chrome browser and it decodes and plays them on the fly. Hit the Cast icon in the corner of the browser and it streams content to the TV. I have tried it my wired PCs and Laptops with MP4s, MKVs, MP3s, JPEGs, PNG, and others. In all cases it is flawless. I am getting one for every TV. It's a must have for any techie. BTW - When I typed this, I was streaming \\"A Bugs Life\\" to the kids TV in their room from the PC in my office; it's a beautiful thing.
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|This is probably the worst Nicholas Sparks book I've ever read. The morals are ridiculous, and the ending is ridiculous.  By far the most pointless book I've read in the last 15 years.
B008H7HE9S|5.0|I requested I be sent the version without cursing and I received the version WITH cursing.<br /><br />Just the same, I love this CD!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Very colorful and entertaining for my grandaughter she is learning while she enjoying making puzzles and the alpabet . I am able to keep her entertained while i do chores
B00001OH80|5.0|First time I've heard this album in years. Still sounds great. First time I bought it was on vinyl now I have the CD.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|I love this album. Unfortunately, when I checked out other work by him, he drops too much profanity and gets pretty dirty.  I could do without that from him. He's a great talent. I love the country influence on this album.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Our daughter has loved this Jumperoo. She plays in it daily.  The variety of toys keeps her busy for 30-40 minutes at a time. The chair is very easy to wipe clean for a small mess and easily goes through the was for bigger messes.<br /><br />The only downside is that she is now five months and we still have to put a box under her feet, as even on the lowest setting she cannot touch the floor.<br /><br />All and all a great purchase.
B002LANLDK|5.0|Surprised it was that good -<br />Whole family enjoyed it.  Of course there's the cheesy scenes where they do the impossible but that's to be expected.  Good plot and Vin Diesel always defines the feeling of the whole show.
