B002BSHWUU|5.0|I love having the whole collection. It sounds wonderful ! I am glad I made this purchase. I recommend it to all<br />Beatles fans.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I like the graphic...very clean and the storyline is great.....it is definitely adventurous and intriguing.  I have not completed the entire game but I definitely will enjoy this game hands down....must play.....
B00BE909NO|5.0|I loved this book, couldn't put it down. I liked how the story of Matilda mirrored the life and experience of Mr Pip of Great Expectations just in a different part of the world. The writing was crisp andunpretentious, reflecting the mind of a young girl, but not so simple that we are left with a childrens' story. I highly recommend this book.
B00BTYP6QE|3.0|rather boring after a short while. Maybe I'm not smart enough ! Seems to go over the same games all the time.
B00867HDTA|5.0|This game is a Very fun game.  I love flick golf, but so far this js better.  Way to go
B00BXZ3D6Y|4.0|Hey people. This app is good for you to record things. Hey, if you have a k i k message  me at awesomebooboo need someone to talk to. On is a wonderful app I recommend you buy it. But I am 12, so do message me if you are older than 20. Buh bye
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I love Avenged Sevenfold and this album has not let me down nor has all their other albums to date.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My opinion is that this game is sooooo much like the movie and i love the movie so it is very hard not to like this movie
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|The sound to these songs are different than the past but just as amazing as all of their other albums
B006ORLAPC|1.0|Really enjoy this movie in English<br /><br />Vendor (DaaVeeDee) sent me the Dutch Version. Could not play it- I am in Region 1. Blu ray and DVD combo made for Region 2. Life goes on though. Returned
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written, with complex characters , continues to tell stories which give insight into Afghanis culture and struggles, painfully honest and emotionally gripping.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Really like this game. Fun game to play like building my city my way and like building my army and the competition that the game offers. And how you have to earn all the things you acquire while playing the game and move up through the levels
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Fantastic movie! Just what you'd expect from the already amazing 4th generation of My Little Pony. Cute ponies and peanut butter snacks.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|from my teen a cappella singer's point-of-view:  loved the songs and the lead male is so cute!<br />from me:  yep, I love the movie, too!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I love to read and have read so many books over my lifetime, but none like this book! It was written perfectly. I loved the characters, the storyline and how it ended. I loved the connection of all the characters and how real they seem. The epilogue was my absolute favorite! This was by far the best book I have ever read!!! I can't wait to read more books by this author!!
006224454X|2.0|The premise of this book hooked me: a woman has experienced a trauma that results in her memory being wiped out on a daily basis. Christine wakes every morning to a stranger in her bed who tells her he is her husband who has been caring for her since her accident. He shows her photos and gives her a tour of her house, then leaves for work<br /><br />Eventually, Christine begins seeing a doctor in secret, writing down her daily experiences in the hopes of recovering her memory. As she reads her journal each day, she begins to find inconsistencies in the stories her husband tells her. Is he lying to her? And, if so, why?<br /><br />If you're looking for a plot-driven, suspense- this might be a good choice. The plot twist at the end was something I did not see coming and I had that great moment where a book gives goosebumps on the scalp.<br /><br />However, if you enjoy character-driven fiction where you connect with a story- this is not it. Perhaps by virtue of her condition, you never even get to know the main character. She doesn't remember who she is and is in a constant primal state of fear and confusion. She trusts no one and neither does the reader. None of the characters are people you understand or root for, including Christine.<br /><br />In the end, I was disappointed by this read and probably would not recommend it.<br /><br />-Katie O'Rourke, author of Monsoon Season
B002ZG997C|5.0|I LOVE this movie. I was so pleased to be able to get it for a great price and not sacrifice the quality of the DVD.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game. Although I have accidently bought land using acorns or money. it would be a little better if there was yes I want to do this button on land buying. I was saving acorns to buy an animal and had to begin saving again. yuck
B009439HEY|2.0|Whilst Watcher of the Skies (Hackett's first Genesis Revisited) had sufficient variation from the originals to make it a worthwhile project (the stunning rendition of Firth of Fifth springs to mind), this new offering is frankly a waste of time, effort and natural resources. Apart from the obvious commercial reasons, I just don't get why he felt the need to do this. It's certainly not an artistic statement, most tracks being just pale knock-offs of the originals, sorely lacking the imaginative reinterpretations that characterized Watcher of the Skies. I'd rather have spent the cash seeing a good Genesis cover band like The Musical Box or The Slippermen. Can I have my money back, Steve?
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this game is very similar to N.O.V.A and halo if you like games where you can just grab a gun and kill someone..get this game NOW!!! (the price is worth it entirely! )
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|what can I say, he's Buddy Guy and you can't go wrong with that. Love the 2 Cd set up.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Sticks on to power device. Does charge a little bit faster.  keeps wear and tear from destroying your normal usb slot.<br />Only downside is  cant really use a stand to whatch videos with cable attached.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I liked this book and the characters. They were all important to the story line and Megan was a strong character not weak like some I enjoyed this simple story
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|love paying this game...really like the fact that you can get more lives from friends and the time on the game...
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Ok its my fault but I glossed over the fact that you cant cast from android browser tabs....besides that, once you start casting a youtube video from android (tab 3) you cant stop it. I am sure that these issues will be resolved, but right now CC is just a novelty if you want to use it with your tablet in hotel rooms.
B009A87X80|5.0|I love Eva Cassidy's music. Soothing music. Thankful that I read about her music in a book. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to relax.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Amazing! Best book I've read in a while. Characters were written very well and the plot was engaging. Excited to read the next one.
B00ET9T2WK|2.0|The concept of this game is great, and most of the delivery and script is well done too...but...it's horribly unpolished. It crashes frequently (minus one star) and the missions are given in an almost random order instructing you to build certain buildings or units before you feasibly can (minus another star). Then comes 'fremium' which I don't mind, except that some missions require you to purchase those items...guess I won't be completing those missions (minus the third star).
B006IYG5HE|1.0|It was completely unreadable. I did not finish it and I don't want to. The first book was ok. This one stinks.
B008Y6RYDS|5.0|It's a classic, what can I say.  One of a kind film with a great soundtrack.  They don't make them like this anymore.
B0041KW2UQ|1.0|We sent this as a gift to our brother's children...when they got it in the mail, it wouldn't play on their DVD player because it was in Italian and the DVD player couldn't read the disc.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Make sure you're wide awake before tackling Doodle Jump! Simple concepts, no need to peek at 'cheats', just make sure you're sitting comfortably somewhere, and your hands and wrists are ready for action. The character is a simple one, with simple skills, but watch out for the action and monsters!<br />Really liked this one.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|Would not recommend getting this from this person. I thought it was going to be as the picture but it wasn't. I got a whole different box that had a different picture. He clamed it was the British version. He gave me like a whole essay on why he sent me the British one and how its better. I thought that was odd. Also, I thought it was strange that he didn't put in a return label. I got my money back and just sent it back right away. I didn't want to chance it. So if you would want a British one, go ahead and purchase. I didn't know until I got it. False advertising!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A wonderful season.  Rick has some mental challenges and has to find his way through them, while also trying to set an example for his quickly-maturing son.  I read the website descriptions as it was happening last year and still loved it 5 starts watching it actually unfold.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|love the app... when it works! shows book has downloaded,  but no txt.  works fine on pc.  not much support.
B0095VPBM2|4.0|A very good processor.  I have this in a low-end HTPC build.  It plays netflix and Hulu fine, handles internet browsing, and even does a good job at DVDFab ripping and Handbrake encoding.  I never feel like processing is slow (unlike my work computer which I always notice is slow).  So as long as it's doing my HTPC things smoothly I'll be happy.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I got this as FAOTD and I was excited because it was normally $1.99. I like these puzzles and I go through the 5x5 grids like a hot knife through butter. I haven't worked on the 10x10 grids on this puzzle yet but can't wait to challenge myself.  Get this app. You will love it and the paintings are colorful.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I play on a kindle fire and the objects are very hard to see. Probably better on a bigger screen other than that its an enjoyable game that requires no money to continue playing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think I may be addicted to this game... it is SO much fun! I'm really happy that there are new levels... the beach is a great addition!
1476727651|4.0|I want to start out by saying that I usually abhor sequels. However, Dr. Sleep was a wonderful and satisfying read. I don't want to elaborate because I worry about over-hyping the book. It's great.  Read it. Great job Mr. King. Thank you for always writing characters that I want to check in on.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|It was a good read you could realy understand the relationships forming with everyone that thor encountered in this book. I would have liked to learn a bit more about his powers and where he came from in the first book but im sure i will get al the answer s to my questions soon enough.
B0041KYLAU|1.0|Was not clearly advertised as an Italian language edition  that will not even play on US based DVD players !
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|I am only saying that this game is okay because my daughter chos it.  This is not the kind of game that I would choose for myself.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|This game is great! There's even the super peel out! It would be better with chaos emeralds! Great game sets!!
B005HSL626|3.0|Again, this is not the type of game I would choose for myself.  My daughter chose this game for herself.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Do yourself a favor and watch this series...it's great TV, great drama and an unexpected ending...warning, don't cheat yourself and look it up, you'll miss half the fun of watching it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really enjoyable book .  The characters were awesome and I could hardly put the book down.  COULD NOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS Next.  I think that this was one of his better books and can't wait for his next one.
1885167776|5.0|Great book!  Not easy sometimes to focus on what we need to focus on.  This book really gets down to the simple truths.  Recommend for everyone!!!  Christmas presents for family members.....
B009CG29RK|5.0|Love this movie!!!  It's not just for kids. Grown-ups get the message about how much joy children bring to your life.
0761174192|5.0|Found this calendar by accident in 2013. Loved it! And so I'd a couple friends. So I bought one for each of us for 2014. The photography is amazing. And there aren't any foolish/silly captions  on the pages
B004JZBGWI|5.0|So love it keeps me organized with my lists its a wonderful app to have love it very much :)
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This was a great book depicting what she went through during her time in prison.  I have not seen the Netflix series, but after reading the book I can't wait to find time to do so.  I would definitely reccommend this to anyone!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I and my wife love this show I makes you feel like your a part of  there rage tag family of misfits. fighting the good fight to stay alive and not be lunch or dinner.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|one of those mindless addicting games that I enjoy with my children. My son downloaded it to my Kindle. :)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|And now the waiting begins... So many lives that could be extinguished -but are they truly dead? I will have to wait, and wait...hopefully not as long as before as I truly cannot wait years for the next book. Perhaps we need to lock Ser Martin in a tower with his writings to hurry him along? So many characters are coming together to bring this all to the final stages although he could easily keep this going for many more books. Let winter finally come! I am waiting.....
B0083Z614S|5.0|I chose this rating because it was very mysterious and interesting because of Mary, Collin and Dickon. I liked how the<br />author made it from different people's point of view and how it felt like you were in the book
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I've been waiting for this one forever but it was a bit of a let down. While I really liked the main character, Dan Torrance, and his Doctor Sleep storyline, I just could not get interested in the story about the True Knot. Was kind of a silly storyline to me. From page 200 on I was ready to move on to my next book - The Memory of Trees by F.G. Cottam. Glad all the other fans enjoyed it. Just wasn't for me.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie. Brings all the heroes together for a fast paced thriller. Must see movie even if you have not seen any of the single hero shows.
0385504225|5.0|...as I love all Dan Brown's books, I'm sure I will love also this book! Can't wait to read it!!! :)
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|A fascinating account of several young men who joined the Marines after Pearl Harbor and most of them made it through the worst of the war, seeing battles across the Pacific.  Gritty and realistic war footage, not for the squeamish.  Interviews with the real survivors being portrayed are most interesting.
B0018TLRTK|5.0|I bought this cd for a friend who loves Billy Idol!!!<br />He keeps listening to it wherever he goes and, if ciurse, he knows the lyrucs by heart!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I rented this book from the Kindle library. I'm sure glad I found it. The characters are so loveable and you just want the best for them. The descriptions of eighty-six in the Catholic orphanage are gut wrenching. The end had a great twist, I wasn't expecting it at all from the tone in the beginning and middle of the book. I like to be surprised, it doesn't happen much for me in books anymore. I'll probably check into reading more of Mckenna's novels in the near future. Well worth the read and had I known I would've enjoyed it this much, I'd gladly have been willing to pay for the download.
B001ED7C58|3.0|I expected something more....too slow...but who loves the mivie...ths cd is perfect and remind us of the main characters!! I think I would not buy them, afterall
0316010669|5.0|Haven't finished reading but this book shipped easily and without hassle- bought for my husband and it was recommended to me by another youth minister. No flaws and on time!
031606792X|3.0|I saw only the first 2 movues as I got fed up with this plot too sweet!! I think I'll read this book in a few years...
1439170045|5.0|Book arrived in great shape. Price was great. Story hit home just lost my dad to alzheimers and it gave me a new insight to his last months.
B000QXDH42|5.0|This product is in mint condition and it arrived on time.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that is a heavy metal buff.
B001H9JBW6|5.0|From the moment this precient narrative begins, viewers are transported to another world, in the not too distant future. The whole ensemble cast, from Benedict Cumberbatch, to Anamaria Marinca and Robert Carlyle, make this dark futuristic tale by Peter Berry more believable. Cumberbatch is superb as Stephen Ezard, a research scientist just returning to London from China to attend his brother Michael's funeral. After all his years away, he is bewildered by an England he does not recognize; London has become a police-state. Unlike his late-brother, Stephen Ezard is a recluse who abhors germs and personal contact. Despite his walls, he's drawn to his brother's complex widow, Yasim (Anamaria Marinca delivers a finely nuanced tough/gentle performance), a medical doctor. They become embroiled in a swirl of conspiracies while he works on the government's super-database. Ezard's struggle to survive is a superb character study enriched by a marvelous performance by Cumberbatch. Robert Caryle is perfect as a menacing rogue government agent - quite convincing. Despite the subject matter, this isn't a political left/right film or story. As one outsider-character states, people have the right to be anonymous. \\"The Last Enemy\\" explores what happens when populations lose that privacy. A topical, haunting story, quite relevant to issues today, and also reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's masterpiece [[ASIN:1451673310 Fahrenheit 451]].
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Sometimes difficult to follow the character transitions.... But as usual very descriptive and well written.  Have read all his books.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I love it. It became my favorite TV show recently. Still wondering what the ending would be. Love love it.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I was using this app and then a couple days later I was logged out and can't log back in. I see a bunch of people with the same issue. Please fix. I like using kik. If not fixed soon. I'll just delete the app. It's annoying!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|The toy box arrived right on time.  It's very roomy & should fit a lot of my grand-daughters toys in it.  The colors are nice & bright & the bottom drawers are just right for storing puzzles or books.
B004UID2LC|1.0|My Kindle Fire HD identified You Tube Down loader as malicious and advised me to uninstall it. So, I did. Avoid at all costs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|All I can say is I love it. It's such a great pass time. And it is very challenging. Keeps u on it toes. Great mental exercise for both kids and adults.
B004TI5N38|5.0|In all his stories Baldacci demands the reader's full attention and usually gets it.<br />Zero Day is no exception and may be the most demanding of his stories. A very good story, full of action, adventure, a very believable (perhaps even possible) conspiracy. There may be a novel out there that is more entertaining and if so, it was probably written by Baldacci.<br />Dave<br />[...]
B005DIAQ5S|2.0|So the headline says it all folks... there are sums that can supplement ur practise for the real test & you will be thankful u have this book ONLY if ur an average math scorer & need tons of practise before u cud get a headstart over the topic.<br /><br />However if uve scored above 80% in school then ure better off without this book & ud be better off using gmat800 or one of the other tougher math materials.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book gave me a lot to think about and made so much sense. I wish that I had read this many years ago.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the app before the new version. I uninstalled the app after the new version was released in June/July. I just reinstalled again thinking that the uselessness of the new version had been corrected...but since it hasn't,  I am uninstalling again.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|It's amazing that most businesses continue to follow old practices producing old products and old people. \\"We've always done it this way\\" mentality serves only to stifle creativity and produce weariness and frustration. Thanks for shining a light on a path less traveled. I enjoyed the journey.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|The complexity of the characters and storyline keep you hooked! I couldn't stop watching, I finished the entire first season in two days!
0061950726|4.0|Even though my Dad worked for the railroads in St. Paul, Minn. I had not heard of the orphan trains until recently. This was a good lesson of history but with a fictional touch.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Kept me entertained (as well as my son). Glad I took a chance on it! Easy to understand once I saw the video and instructions. Would purchase it again!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I may be the perfect audience for this bibliotechphile lovefest reading it at the wrong time or... maybe this is a novel that should have remained a short story or progressed no further than a novella. It's just too quiet for this reader who is craving adventure. And, at least at the beginning, the prose is too soaring, too lyrical for the subject matter. You can write about books and computers with beautiful poetic words -- but not for long. That's why poems tend to be less than a couple pages long. Sloan's poetic prose, on the other hand, spoken in the first-person and describing the intersection of books and technology is just too self-conscious to feel genuine. There are some moments where reality breaks through:<br />\\"[Make] friends with a millionaire when he's a friendless sixth-grader. Neel Shah has plenty of friends...but on some level they know, and he knows, that they are friends with Neel Shah, CEO. By contrast, I am, and always will be, friends with Neel Shah, dungeon master.\\"<br />\\"I never thought I'd actually meet [a hot girl wizard], but that's only because I didn't realize wizards were going to walk among us and we'd just call them Googlers.\\"<br />Flowery prose is a hallmark of telling rather than showing. I can't experience description. I can only lose myself if I can identify fully with the character's reactions and emotions, which means they have to be described in fairly prosaic terms. Unless your audience is college professors.
B00ET7EON4|3.0|Good original rock.  Just wish it had more catchy tunes.  Like the appearance by Josh Homme.  Still better than most bands on the radio.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|It feels like Dan Brown had the germ of a good idea, found himself under a deadline, and this book is the sad result. I don't ask for realism, but I do ask for believability. Firstly, the dialog was stilted and far too much resembled exposition. Secondly, there are two main plot points that are used as revelatory moments that just don't work for me: Mal'akh's identity and the threat to national security. Anyone who is surprised by the first has obviously never read a book or seen a movie, and by the time it was revealed to the characters, I had gotten so irritated by Brown's self-deluded cleverness, I was just annoyed by it all. And the risk to national security? Why exactly does Sato not tell them the truth from the beginning so they don't spend the entire novel working at cross-purposes? Because that would eliminate an entire storyline from the novel! Of course, it would make our security services look not quite so stupid either. (Side note: anyone else annoyed at the CIA operating domestically? How about DHS, NSA, FBI? Anyone except CIA?)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. Can't wait for next season. Love all the characters on the show. It was nice watching it on my laptop with no interruption.
0761172726|5.0|Easy and fun way to keep organized. I like having a spot for each person and the boxes are large so I can put details in them. Viewing the month at a glance is helpful to me.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've used this for almost a month now, and I absolutely love being able to stream Netflix and YouTube from my tablet. This is a step up from streaming on Xbox since I don't have to pay for Live. Also, it's great to use to fall asleep to Netflix since I don't have to let the Xbox run and can just have my tablet on (which is quieter).
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I hate books cause I'm  a 13 year old boy but I actually enjoyed reading this book. This book didn't make sence at some points but it's a definite 5 star to me
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is a great complement to a Roku as it brings YouTube and Google Play music/TV/film to a  TV, which are not on the Roku.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|THIS IS SO AWESOME AND INTERTAINING SO MUCH! I LOVE IT AND IT DESERVES 1000000000000000000000 STARS.3 WORDS:BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!! (and it lowered the price!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the worlds best game and not a waste of money i thought it was until i bought it. It is the best game ever
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This is awesome and the best book ever<br />I love this book and I want to read some book of him
B008JFUR10|1.0|Robots and robot like aliens fighting each other for over two hours , that's it.Actors  behaving like caricatures and a story written by a toddler.I never saw a 'movie' that was so bad as this one.This 'product' cannot be made by Guillermo Del Toro.You have been warned.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This app has everything you could ask from a griddler puzzle. Moreover the pictures themselves are great and there is quite a variety to choose from.
B00DCP0082|5.0|Annihilator is currently:<br />Jeff Waters - guitars, bass and backing vocals<br />Dave Padden - lead/backing vocals, guitars<br />Mike Harshaw - drums<br />Alberto Campuzano - bass<br />These crazy Canadians are at it again! This may not be the original line-up from the Alice in Hell album, but it certainly doesn't diminish their quality. Harshaw & Campuzano are touring musicians, but contribute well at live performances! Padden is now stretching his vocal ablities all over this album and Waters, who has been there from the 1984 start, is still the mainstay and driving force behing Annihilator! There is some fine musicianship on this album! The songs are an amazing sonic onslaught to mosh or play air guitar to! The Bonus disc on this album is an amazing catalog of Annihilator's past re-imagined. All the old songs are re-done and have a new life and vigor about them for everyone to experience and enjoy! Hopefully some stability can be brought to the line up and Annihilator will provide us with more from their creative Thrash arsenal to further their relentless sonic assault on us all in the coming future! Add this to your collection, turn it up obnoxiously LOUD and melt your neighbor's ears with this Disc!
B008HK3S4K|5.0|Good quality and a nice tight fit makes this a good choice for those who don't use a case on their Fire.  The velcro fold over is of excellent quality and not likely to wear out.  My 13 year old son loves it.
B00EJXY47Y|4.0|great movie but different than I thought. I really didn't know much about her and was watching it because of Amanda was in it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. It made me late for work several times because I just couldn't put it down.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|love using facebook for keeping contacts in touch, socializing in general, keeping up with other announcements, and keeping track of favorite company pages!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|It just works! Now I am able to keep track of it so easily. And there is plenty of info provided besides the phases which is nice for learning.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love this show! This season is escalating as the characters display a more personal touch to the actions they perform.
1439190275|5.0|Good book for the diet.  I've lost seven pounds in 10 days.  I went from a size 12 to a 2 a few years back and as long as I behaved and worked out was good for over five years.  I just let it slip up on me over the last 10 years and now I am back to losing 50 lbs.  Can't blame the diet.  Totally me.  I love not being hungry or low blood sugar though.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Although the plot was rather benign and a repeat of many romance novels, it did allow me to enjoy a respite from all the noise of the world.
B0036MDN80|5.0|I love it. The little tiger is so cute. These animals look very realistic and I have started to collect them.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|It was so nice to have this available on instant video as this movie is hard to find as a rental. We enjoyed watching it.
B001N4Q4MA|5.0|I love the flexibility of renting movies through Amazon!  It is so easy and convenient because you can watch them anywhere you may go!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works really well. It will even wake you up with any song that you have downloaded to your device. Slow starter in the mornings? Put your favorite workout song on it to get you pumped up instantly.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|Zack has finally crossed the border. I've seen almost everything he's done recently and it's been a toss-up: he's loud, he's wild, he says and does weird things. Are they funny things he does? Not often. But the ensembles he appeared with before Hangover II kept him buried far enough down in the mix that these glaring defects didn't show, while letting his weirdo-schtick persona do a few gags here and there. In this movie, his character is pushed to prominence showing a nasty-at-hearrt vein of non-humor that destroys the film before it can even begin.

B005LAIIGM|5.0|Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.<br /><br />Most movie lovers can remember seeing a film for the first time that really got their attention.  Usually it was in a real movie theater.  For me it was \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\"  The juxtaposition of a flung femur bone transfiguring into a space shuttle lining up to dock at an orbiting station, all to the backdrop of classical music was mind blowing to this science fiction lover.  A few year later, sitting in a large theater I was again mesmerized by a giant space ship moving slowly across dark space.  \\"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\\" had a new technical trick at its disposal.  Dolby Surround Sound.  A new generation will likely have \\"Gravity\\" to look back on.  Yes, it's that good.<br /><br />Director Alfonso Cuaron (\\"Children of Men\\"), who also wrote the screenplay with his son Jonas, has managed to provide an electrifying thriller with a basic story.  A flight crew headed by Lt. (a lieutenant, really?) Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) have been sent to repair the Hubble Telescope.  The scientist in charge of the repairs is the ever-so-serious Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock).  There are no other actors who have any role of substance other than the voice of Ed Harris at Mission Control early on.<br /><br />In a quick turn of events, it is learned that the Russians have destroyed one of their spy satellites.  The explosion has set off a chain reaction of debris hurtling through space taking out other satellites along the way.  With only minutes to react, Kowalski's crew attempt to get the shuttle out of orbit.  They don't.  Now in survival mode, Kowalski and Stone must figure out how to get back to Earth.  This becomes even more complicated, as radio communication with Mission Control has been severed.<br /><br />Cuaron provides Sandra Bullock an opportunity to show her acting range and she responds with a performance that will be remembered for a long time.  Stone's early panic, as the space debris knocks her away from Kowalski and the shuttle, comes across to the audience.  We see the terror in her eyes, in her breathing and in the fogging helmet shield.  The other star of the film is Cuaron's cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki and the visual and special effects department.  It is the most amazing thing I think I've ever seen on screen.  And yes, see it now.  Don't wait for this movie to come to you by Netflix.  And yes, see it in 3D.  I pick and choose when to spend an extra $3 or $4 dollars on 3D and I made the right decision here.<br /><br />Gravity has several meanings.  The most used and obvious one for this movie has to do with the force of bodies falling toward Earth.  But gravity also is defined as a serious or critical nature.  Also, serious or dignified behavior.  All apply.  Cuaron and his team will likely need a truck to load nominations come Oscar time.  Don't miss it.way from Kowalski and the shuttle, comes across to the audience.  We see the terror in her eyes, in her breathing and in the fogging helmet shield.

We all want to be rich, with 2 rich boyfriends fawning after us, and have a house like that anywhere.  Painful to watch the 'Sex' scene, and cutting up a perfectly good sweater is terrible and NOT funny, and Diane's crying scenes should be cut, but we all keep watching it and stay for house...and Paris.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|Many people don't take science fiction seriously, but here's a movie that might work for those who don't usually like the genre. There are no aliens, unknown worlds, monsters, or laser shootouts. This is a movie that's set in the real world, or more accurately, above it.<br /><br />The story opens with a George Clooney voice-over. We meet astronauts working to repair a satellite. This shows how calm such a silent world can be. I reluctantly saw the movie in 3D, but this was one occasion that I came away feeling that it added to the experience. It almost made me dizzy seeing Ryan Stone (Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (Clooney) go about their routine business with Earth looming large in the background. Indeed, the cinematography was breathtaking throughout the 90 minutes.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too many details, but if you have seen the trailer or even looked at the poster, you'll know that this movie is far from being a calm ride. An accident sends debris racing toward the astronauts like some kind of deadly shrapnel. What follows is a story about the strength of the human spirit, and the will to survive against all odds. Remember that the word gravity has more than one meaning.<br /><br />While I enjoyed Sandra Bullock's performances in The Blind Side and Speed, I would hardly describe myself as a fan. However, I left the theater thinking that she carried the whole movie, and it's easily the most accomplished performance of her career.<br /><br />Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n directed Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n, Children of Men, and the best Harry Potter movie (Azkaban), but this is comfortably my favorite from his impressive portfolio. The story is lean, gripping, thoughtful, thrilling, scary, breathtaking, beautiful, and emotional, and feels perfectly paced at every point. He doesn't insult us by giving too much exposition, and that draws us deeper into the story. His use of extreme close-ups is another reason we are drawn to these characters. It's hard to avoid feeling that you are a part of the movie.<br /><br />As I watched, I thought of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Moon, Apollo 13, Cast Away, Alien, and a few other great movies. Cuar&oacute;n lets us see his characters thinking, and that's a good thing. Remember that astronauts are not selected because they are stupid or incapable of adapting in extreme situations. I'm always impressed when I see a movie which takes the trouble to show how people really think. It's not an easy thing to do well. This choice works perfectly and helps the whole story succeed because it's so believable.<br /><br />Although the visuals dazzled on a regular basis, my favorite shot in the whole movie was Sandra Bullock in the fetal position. It jumped out at me as being so appropriate for the scene, and it was a stroke of genius. You'll know what I mean when you see it. The opening titles remind us that there is no sound in space, just as Kubrick depicted almost 50 years ago.<br /><br />I admire this movie so much that I would happily watch it again tomorrow. It's a wild 90 minutes. I left the theater feeling as if it was an effort to be back in the real world. I was totally immersed in the story to the point of being almost unable to function when it was over. I'm glad I had a long walk back to the car so that I could catch my breath.<br /><br />There are so many reasons to see this movie, even if you hate science fiction. It won't be forgotten when the awards season arrives. See it immediately. I would even go as far to say you should see it in 3D.you are a part of the movie.<br /><br />As I watched, I thought of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Moon, Apollo 13, Cast Away, Alien, and a few other great movies.

B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Rainbow Rowell's young adult novel, Eleanor and Park, is a compelling story of a teen relationship. The book is being banned for what some say is the foul  language and for accurately describing teenagers physical relationships. I think what many adults can't face in this book are the hard realities of poverty, domestic violence, and the challenges of having a stepfather who is  less than supportive to children from a prior relationship. Rainbow's writing is always spot on when describing people and relationships. I loved the story and value the strength and power of her writing.

0316066524|3.0|I'm 364 pages into this book as of October 5, 2013. I thought for sure I would love this novel, I hold D.F.W. in high-esteem even though he committed suicide. I really tried reading this book with an open-mind, its length doesn't intimidate me since I'm at the moment reading 11 books simultaneously. In my opinion this book is just a very long suicide note. There's many references to nooses and hanging in the book. Is it only a coincidence that Wallace hung himself? I can relate to almost all the characters in this book, I know what Wallace was trying to achieve with Infinite Jest but I don't think he succeeded even though I really wanted him to. I feel this book could have been edited considerably, there's hundreds of pages of nonsense, bad grammar, at times annoying narratives, hundreds if not thousands of abbreviations which can get annoying since Wallace expects you to flip to the glossary every time you find a footnote, there are exactly 388 footnotes. If this isn't an Infinite Let Down then it is a monumental exercise in absolute patience. In some sense I feel like the novel is one big joke, like the joke is on us for reading it. I feel the remaining 715 pages will be no different from what I've already encountered in the first 300. Is it a brilliant novel? It's nowhere near brilliant, it could have been brilliant without the 300+ footnotes and the who knows how many pointless abbreviations. Is the novel really a literary representation of a Sierpinski gasket as Wallace himself claimed? It is no fractal, it's more like an obscenely splattered painting that is so obsessively structured it's absurd.

0385344228|5.0|The book opens with an interview before the grand jury a year after the main events of the books. Andy Barber, whose is the narrator of the story, answer the questions to the prosecutor Logiudice, but the narrotor hides from us what this grand jury is about, returning us to the history of events in April 2007.<br /><br />In the town called Newton 14-year-old boy Ben Rifkin is found murdered. He was killed in a park near the school with three stabs of the knife in the chest. The lessons in the school are cancelled, and on the place detectives attached to the case arrive with the prosecutor - assistant district attorney Andy Barber. He is 50-year-old man, experienced, who often takes the resonant cases. Barber immediately assumes that this case will get much publicity. Barber is not confused that Rifkin studied in the same class with Barber's son, Jacob, because there is no indication that the killer is one of the children. No evidence has been found on the ground, no weapon, too, and five days after the murder, the police still have no suspects and versions. There is one clue, however: on the ground a fingerprint has been found.<br /><br />When Barber receives an anonymous e-mail with a link to the facebook group \\"Friends of Ben Rifkin,\\" created after his death, on the wall Barber reads an entry written by a friend of Jacob, Derek, in which Derek says that Jacob has a knife. Later, Jacob is arrested on suspicion of murder, Andy is suspended from work, and the family starts to prepare for trial.<br /><br />This novel, unlike Jacob, do es not need to be defended, so good it is. It needs to be praised. «Defending Jacob» is very realistic novel. The multi-faceted, exciting, intense, knocked down. The premise seems to be simple: the prosecutor's son is accused of murder, and father has to defend ot not defend his son. And the child needs defendung because he is your son, you are responsible for him, you raised him, and then gave him a \\"murder gene\\", even if it's just speculation. Andy Barber within all the book length tries to convince himself and all others that Jacob is not guilty, but deep down he just does not doubt that his son is a murderer; Barber's actions give him away. He finds a knife and throws it away without giving the examination. He deletes the information from Jacob's computer. He argues with his wife, accusing her of that she sets herself against her son, comes up with things.<br /><br />But the thing is that the author really does not point who is the killer. The choice of the narrator here is perfect: who killed the boy, may know only Jacob, but from him we learn nothing, so we can just as his father, wonder, had he killed, or hadn't? Landay has built a book around a slippery case. It seems that there are facts, and they show on Jacob, but if you look closely, it's not even the facts, not even evidence, they are just speculation and doubts. And the jury is not sitting there in the courtroom, on the pages of the book, we are the jury, we are here to judge.<br /><br />It's interesting to see Logiudice in the book, who is acting as the dark half of Andy. Again, the author leads the reader on a slippery slope. What Logiudice is so actively trying to put Jacob behind the bars, can be regarded as a personal grudge against Barber. This is an attempt to drown the son, and at the same time his father, to remove a competitor. But Barber sees the situation in that way, he is generally can not be trusted. Loguidice asks all the questions which Barber asks himself. Logiudice is a worm of doubt, the devil on Barber's shoulder.<br /><br />The book really knocks down, but not by some individual moments, but by the whole complex. How does it feel to see your son before the trial, and you do not know he is guilty or not? What is above, the blood or the law? Is a father responsible for a son and grandson for his grandfather? «Defending Jacob» raises these questions and more in full growth. Here are collisions between speculation and science, law and justice, the father and son, society and the individual.<br /><br />Reading the book, one can't not to get into Barber's skin, it is impossible not to feel fear when the day of trial approaches, it is impossible not to simpatize - not to the boy but for father. Landay describes with the great delicacy the entire proceedings, interrogations, legal tricks. This is a pleasure to watch how Barber follows the battle of the prosecutor and attorney, noticing mistakes, lucks, the reaction of the jury.<br /><br />The hero of the book Andy Barber is a good man; this is not going to argue. After all, what makes a person good person? A good man and good father would believe his son to the last, will defend him to the last. But are you a good man if you defend the criminal, your son criminal?<br /><br />«Defending Jacob» is a portrait of justice, a portrait ugly but honest.

B00E9P959O|5.0|I remember waiting for Vapor Trails to be finished and released just like all the other Rush fans then. I'd heard One Little Victory on the radio and figured it would sound better when I had a copy in my CD player. I was wrong.<br /><br />I remember thinking that the guys do their best work under a deadline and they just over did it. Ok, I can live with that. After all, there has to be at least one project that goes south in every stellar career, right?<br /><br />Tour comes around and I can hear what I should have heard from those new songs from the get go! Ahhhh! This is what Earthshine should REALLY sound like!<br /><br />S&A comes around, tour and all that, I kinda forgot about VT.<br /><br />Fast forward a bit. Clockwork Angels tour just wraps and a guy at work says something about a VT remix. I personally hate remix anything! Having a wide range of taste from swing, classic rock, classical, oldies, trance, electronica, and well, you get the idea. I like to hear what the original artist intended you to hear, not what someone else reimagines.<br /><br />After reading that Geddy Lee was also not happy with the original mix of VT, I took the plunge and bought the Remixed album.<br /><br />This is what Rush intended for us to hear to begin with! Ged's vocals are clear, Alex's guitar is perfect, Neil's drums are, well Neil's drums.<br /><br />No more mush of too many different vocal tracks! You hear Ged the way you should. Guitar tracks are simplified. Bass is sharp. This is what we wanted in 2002! Is it perfect? No, but its well worth buying a second time!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. I play it everyday. It gives you more chances to win. It even has Elvis bingo.
B000F7CMQ8|4.0|I just love Clark Gable! He is so sexy! I am  also an animal lover! The jungle scenes, wild animals and the rivalry of the two women are outstanding! I loved everything about this movie!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really like how the story highlights daily challenges of August. It shows how you can rise above that and be who you are.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|I found this book to be tedious for the first half. It got interesting for a while there in the middle and I will admit in nearly threw up my own heart when the big twist unfolded. As a whole though I have to say this book was a disappointment. The writing style lacked oomph and I found it difficult to like or connect with any of the characters. I despised the ending and was left feeling extremely grumpy when it was over. Read if you must but I would happily take back the time I spent reading this book.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Well acted, interesting storylines with the occasional camio by a political figure or tv personality. My only complaint is that the main actress does appear blank, blah and disengaged.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|For the first time a credible book that gives one a perspective of Jesus the man that we rarely have ever seen. Not only do we get clarity from other writings that are not readily known by the public and ignored by the Catholic Church, but for the first time a real understanding of events that followed his crucifixion and the animosity of the two major Christian factions that developed after his death, led by James, Jesus's brother, and Paul, a Pharisee, who later became St. Paul and whose letters eventually became the basis for Jesus's acceptance as the messiah to his followers in the century following his death.<br /><br />This is a well written book which holds your attention from the start, in spite of the laborious scripture from lessor known texts and the multitude of names that make up this amazing story of how this one billion member religion had its beginning from a poor, uneducated, carpenter, living in a dirt floor abode, in a little know town, Nazareth, who has touched and influenced more people than anyone in the human race as we know it.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Disjointed story line, not even close to the book - really just a \\"jump out of the dark\\" suspense movie.  Pitt is a very good actor as usual, just bad material here.  They should have done the book plot as a 2 or 3 part movie.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl tells about an adventure that I have always wanted to take but never found the time or courage. Vicariously through her story, I lived the experience. I felt sad when her journey ended, but I am looking forward to the movie.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Pacific Rim is a great popcorn movie.  It doesn't try to be Hamlet, it's just a movie about giant robots beating up giant monsters.  Don't expect a detailed plot, just expect battles between robots and monsters.  Good stuff!  The visuals are great.  In the tradition of Godzilla, Voltron, and a dozen other movies and TV shows.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|I just got back from watching Gravity and I am still in awwww. Ryan (Sandra Bullock) and Matt (George Clooney) are on a space walk when debris hit the area they are working on causing them be detached from their ship and spin off in space. While trying to figure out a way to get home Ryan has one heck of a fight on her hands. Sandra Bullock does a phenomenal job in this film and I am sure she will get an Oscar nomination, if not the award itself for Best Actress. Whats even more phenomenal is how she carries the entire film herself with very little or no interaction from other people. When you add the 3D element to this movie combined with the stunning visuals, and wonderful performances it just takes you on that emotional journey even more. This is the type of film that showcases what 3D can do when given the right material. I will not give away any of the movie as to not spoil for those who have not seen it yet. I do highly recommend this work of art that is nothing short of a brilliant masterpiece that will truly immerse you and leave you breathless at times.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Make no mistake the amazon mp3 cloud is an attractive concept. But the current implementation is woeful. Lack of functionality means that the 'player' simply serves a (useful) role as a downloader from the amazon cloud. But given the lack of ability to direct downloads to the external sd card, you may as well not bother with this app. Shameful on Amazon that they *could* make this so good, so useful and so popular, but instead have chosen(?) to implement so badly.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great for newbies to the Law of Attraction, and great for the well-versed.  I'm in the second group so I understand manifesting, but this book illustrated for me that my manifestations are slowed by my diluted focus.  So thanks to this easy to read little book, I'm now working on more targeted focus, which is speeding my manifestations up!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I don't love it, but it was for a gift and the recipient loved it!<br />Amazon is easy shopping.  It's my &#34;go-to&#34; store!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is the first game of this type I have played and an enjoying it. I have a kindle fire 8.9 and it works well. My wife also has it on her I pad
B004YXE438|3.0|I've always enjoyed puzzles &amp; have been looking for a way to use my own photos as the puzzles. I finally found this app, but it has two flaws that keep the rating lower. One is the fact that it's only square pieces &amp; the second is the fact that when rotating the pieces, you only get to go one direction, even if the way you need to turn the piece is faster the other way. For example, you can only turn them clockwise, but sometimes counter-clockwise would be faster &amp; result in fewer turns taken.<br /><br />Other than these two flaws, this puzzle game is actually a lot of fun.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!  Classic Tarantino dialogue with a great story line.  Christoph Waltz is sensational (again), and Jamie Foxx is excellent as Django. Tarantino, once again, delivers with great dialogue and story line to go along with the over the top gore and violence.
B008Y212PI|5.0|fun and a challenge if you like puzzles this is so for you. you will love it I know you will
B00F35BV64|4.0|Excellent movie. I really enjoy the new Star Trek franchise.  The character casting is spot on with Chris Pine and Captain Kirk.  Spock, O'Hara, Scotty and Bones are all done exceptionally well.  The action and special effects are awesome, and the movie had a great story line.  I hope they keep them coming!
0553801473|5.0|I have just recently read all 5 books from the Game of Thrones  and loved them all.  I read them back to back so when I was finished experienced real withdrawal symptoms.  Can't wait for # 6 to come out.  But at the end of #5 I was very upset because someone that I really liked dies.  I will not say who, hoping that somehow he gets back. .
B0012QRPU4|3.0|This isn't an actual episode of the show, just a long trailer with but it helped me understand what the show was about since I heard a lot about it but hadn't actually seen any of it.  Good intro.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|So far I am very impressed by these headphones Ive got sennheisers and beats and these are better than the beats and as good if not better than the sennheisers. The round shape and leather pads are ideal for comfort and the auto adjust headband gives it that nice retro look. if youve got some money to drop definintaly check these out!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Became an impressionistic horror film as a result of the shortcomings of the production and the brilliance of the editor. This movie is very good.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I saw essentially the same movie in 1982 (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan [1982])- except Spock dies in the '82 version and the ending is more realistic.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Helps pass the time. Can you escape is a fun and can be challenging at times. My six year old enjoys it too.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Works well, Enjoy The Game. NoT A Problem At All. Easy To Play. I Have Not Tried The Hard Levels Yet
B004JMY312|5.0|This movie is a Halloween favorite in our house!  It is a fun movie to watch!  There is some adult humor, which my little ones never picked up on but overall a fun movie!  Bette Midler is a hoot!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i enjoy this bible it read to you and glad to have it.<br /><br />there words in the bible i can not call and it have me.
B005AUWXZ0|2.0|It is definitely a  kids movie. I didn't like it at all. I've gotten other kids movies, but didn't relate to this one.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|Very good book from the start. I highly recommend all of john greens books. It is a great book for young adults
B00447G29S|5.0|It was a fun movie, especially in 3D. Kids would especially like it. A great Christmas present for under the tree
0143122916|5.0|Let me say that I am not one for nonfiction. However, I do not know much about North Korea and thought this would be a good book to learn something... I was hooked from the very first page. This book instantly captivated me and filled me with so many deep emotions. This book is told in a matter of fact perspective that delves into Shin's life as well as life in North Korea outside of the work camp. The book is one that I think everyone should read. Highly recommended!
B00915G6MG|5.0|Loved it.  I have the  9 preceding seasons,  This is my favorite show.  I like the characters as developed, looking for further development that's been promised for this year
1451673442|4.0|The book is in very good condition.  The content is not as exciting as i thought.  Thank you.  You sent me what i wanted.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Good tutorial and interesting pictures. This game reminds me of I spy. An appropriate level of challenge to make it relaxing and fun.Thank you! My kids like it too.
B00867HDTA|4.0|Before I tried it, I got discouraged from some negative reviews. However, it's a fun and exciting game for someone not much into gaming like me.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Another half-hearted entry in the Reacher canon. I was uncertain about whether my taste had merely changed, or if I was correct in believing the first five Reacher books were far better than the most recent three. I re-read number two, &#34;Die Trying,&#34; and I could clearly see the difference. Earlier books in the series had much grander scope; Reacher was more multi-dimensional and actually had, you know, feelings and stuff; and there were more plot elements in play.<br /><br />Having said all that, I hasten to add that the early Reacher books are, for me, the absolute pinnacle of thriller writing. So missing the target of &#34;best thriller series in the world&#34; still leaves &#34;above-average thriller.&#34; Child is a master of clean prose, superb pacing, and ending chapters on cliff hangers that compel you to keep reading. The book lacks emotional resonance and Reacher himself is fairly cardboard here, but A Wanted Man is still entertaining on an &#34;airplane book&#34; level and for fans of the genre. (Not at all the place to start for anyone new to the series. Killing Floor, Die Trying, or Tripwire are better introductions to the glory of Jack Reacher.)<br /><br />I really hope Child tries harder on the next book. This is three in a row where I'm not sure he had both cheeks in the chair.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I did not like this book because it did not let you search a word or let you search anything
B0063IH60K|3.0|Can anyone tell me why this game just stopped working.  Been playing it for months and it just stopped.  The page is all blank.<br />Thanks
034537410X|5.0|Wanted to learn more about this subject, it is fancinating. Can not wait to get thru the course. It can change our lives. Highly recommend it!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|To those that have a problem with this book, GO AWAY. Marcus was the man on the ground and told his story. It is near impossible to have any short term memory after watching 3 team mates die, then fall off a mountain, then wonder of anyone is coming for you. I have debriefed before and no one had the same story and no one had the same time line. Great book from a even greater person.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Good to watch without advert some shows are being ruined by ill timed adverts so prefer to watch at my leisure
B00AA03D18|4.0|Proof of Heaven by Dr. Eben Alexander is a mostly autobiographical book regarding the author's own NDE (near death experience).  The writing is clear, personal, and non-technical.  Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon so I had expected more science, but most of the discussion regarding possible scientific explanations for a NDE was relegated to the second appendix.  (The first appendix is a brief statement by his own doctor).<br /><br />Dr. Alexander's NDE was particularly intense and long-lasting and the medical cause for his near-death very unique and unlike say a heart attack victim, he remained near death for days.  The reader is left with the impression that the intensity of his NDE and his medical condition are closely related.  Whether or not you believe his near death experience is \\"proof of heaven\\" his book is worth reading.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Had been waiting to view for a few months as wont watch on TV because of advertising, did not disappoint
B00BHMEALA|2.0|As I get older, I cannot tolerate bad movies anymore. This movie stole 2 hours of my life and, no need to mention, some cash. I have no idea why such a bad movie got 7 points on imdb. Possibly, due to patriotic feelings gently patting  our subconscious  and reminding us how much our enemies hated us back at those times. This movie is bad. Why? The movie is full of fictious mistakes; such as a revolutionary guard running to inform his comrades at the airport instead simply given them a call or a character entering the blue mosque in istanbul but then ending up inside hagiasophia. Flight tickets ordered from cia headquarter appears at a computer screen at the tehran airport just  at the moment a staff searches for passenger names a second time (year 1980)... Moreover, Ben Affleck, being the director, spent at least 10 minutes to show his own face (close shots) and occasional few  shots revealing his upper body.  You will see too many unnecessary and childish in the nick of time events, too. Although, the story is nice and based on a real event, the screenplay is like high school play. It's full of cliches.  I would say if you want to see an action movie, go and watch A-team, if you are a political-thriller type, watch Syriana, not this one.
B00915G6SU|4.0|CRIM MINDS 8<br />Always enjoy this show and look forward to the new series as wont watch it on TV as it is ruined by adverts and hard to keep track of the plot with constant interruptions
B00ECLU346|3.0|Really funny! In keeping with the first two, keeps you laughing throughout the whole movie. You won't be dissapointed if you liked the other Hangover movies

B00081912E|5.0|Iloved the movie Jim Carrey is funny as all get up. I would recommend this to anyone. Enjoy this movie
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I am sitting here, way past my bedtime, because I knew I would not be able to fall asleep without learning how this incredibly sad, poignant story ended. This is an emotionally intense story. It is not a light flippant read. You are warned. One cited reviewer likened it to Ordinary People. It is and as just said, an absolutely intense story.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|I didnt use it but i assume is great, i ordered it and then returned it for AMD athlon x4 750K cheaper and instead of apu graphics i bout an evga gtx 650 ti ssc 2Gb
B00CHVJI08|4.0|It was not as funny as I thought it would be but did develop the characters well giving it more depth. What really upset me was  that I ordered it thinking I may get it a little earlier, I didn't and cheaper, I didn't. The movie was being sold at the stores before I received mine and $4.00 cheaper.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game :) should make another one so we can all play another a lot like this my friend is addicted
B00B7FXZQS|2.0|Just not as scary. Stupid ending. Cheap thrills. Annoying little kids. Needs more levitation and body snatching to be good
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This is the first time I heard this series and so far I been liking this is better than the Tv show. I give this 9.5/10.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use, nice large numbers, and free. Tough act to follow.
B009LDD22U|5.0|The fun continues on the funniest show on TV! The perfect cast for the perfect show! The Big Bang Theory rules.
B007SGM084|5.0|I purchased all three of these books.  At the end of the day its a romance novel.  What woman doesn't wish her first time was with a man who pushes you over the edge, is ungodly handsome and a billionaire.  At first the sex is shocking because it isn't vanilla sex.  Its also not that scandalous either.  I think the whole OMG ITS PORN, comes from uptight people who haven't seen porn lately, LMBO!!  Every woman I know that's read this enjoy the fact that Christian has this take hold edge about him.  And all of them would enjoy some of Christians freaky play ideals and they wish their partner would go there.  I think you will find that you relate to Christian or Ana.  I am completely a Christian, very private, focused and hate answering a lot of question about my life.  It was hard for me to get to book two because Ana is so intrusive and whiny with all her nagging questions.  She got on my last nerve to the point it took 5 months before I could go on to book two.  In book two and three the storyline really develops into much more.  Its a character growth for all of them and that was refreshing.  In the beginning the sex keeps you reading but as the plot develops I found I enjoyed the story much more.  By the end of book three I was skipping the sex to get to the what happened.  It didn't disappoint and I enjoyed the ride.  This is a great fantasy man who is wealthy, sexy, troubled, controlling and for all his power over people is in need of the one thing money cant buy..........LOVE.

B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is very fun. I highly recommend it to strategy lovers. I stayed up late one night playing it, I couldn't stop! So very fun.
B00C061HZY|5.0|I actually started collecting some vinyls as of late, and I love how Amazon is not supporting and offering an MP3 album with each vinyl purchase.<br /><br />The album itself is very fun and upbeat and even tells a great story throughout. The MP3 album is an amazing selling point because it's like purchasing 2 copies for the price of one and is a great deal for any vinyl enthusiast or daft punk fan.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Not a great movie, but watchable.  I really enjoy these types of movies.  This one had a little more blood then I expected. I would still say I enjoyed watching it.
B000UR9QHQ|4.0|If the extended version is on DVD, why not re-released on blu ray as well? I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.
B00CCEHR80|4.0|Enough said. He brings his magic to the setlist on here. What more can I say? I love his tone, phrasing and voice. I'm not gonna nit-pick.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun app can be addictive lol. Only on the jeep at the moment and having fun it can be real touchy controls  but have fun.
B00538LHGU|2.0|This review is not of the movie itself which is great, but rather the lackluster quality of the picture on the bluray version. It's very blurry, no sharper to my eye than the DVD and very muddy and washed out looking. It perhaps has a bit of color tweaking so that the saturation is more balanced and to my eye that's it.  This film is in dire need of a proper remastering.  Compared to the couple hundred or so other bluray movies this one is lacking especially in sharpness and brightness.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My son loves the game because it looks real in 3d.  He also likes it because you cam pull and fight the line.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|This review probably won't be very helpful but I loved this movie so I thought I would leave a review. I love how the movie started off funny (funnier for a male I'd imagine) and how the main character changed through the course of the movie. I wish it hasn't ended the way it did... some alternate endings ala Butterfly Effect would have been nice... but the movie flowed well and the character development was well done.<br /><br />It's similar to \\"Falling Down\\" in a way but not as over the top funny and more emotion and drama and storylines going in different directions. I very much enjoyed it... like a fine wine.. some will like it, some will not. It definitely fit the culture of the late 90's but has aged well enough.<br /><br />The title does fit the film, but you have to watch it all the way through to realize what they mean by the title.... that beauty, like anything, is in the eye of the beholder.<br /><br />Bluray Video Quality was slightly above average, Audio Track DTS-HD and good quality. No complaints.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A great read with a reminder of what orphans endured during the orphan train era. Creatively blended the past and future.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I've had low storage on my kindle fire for several months, and no matter how many pictures and songs I deleted I'd always still have little avaliable internal storage, allowing me not to get any new apps. I even deleted some old apps and games to try and help, but it didn't... Well I googled how to clear up space, many amazon customers on the site recommended this app, and so I though I'd give it a go. I have deleted over 900mb on my kindle, and finally the low internal storage notification is gone! Thank you Ks Mobile!!

B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Lorde is an amazing artist and that really shows in this album. Also just saw her in concert and it was amazing, I really respected that she was covered up and not showing a lot of skin (like a lot of young singers) it made me respect her as an artist even more.
B00ESF2772|1.0|I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with this book.  I got it to read to my 16 month old grandson while waiting for our food when dining out.  The pictures are on one screen and the words are on the other.  He should be able to look at the picture while I read the words to him.  I don't recommend this version of the book for young children.
1451695195|2.0|I thought that I would get more information about the time the Dr. spent in heaven. I got more information about e. coli bacteria. I have no reason to doubt the author's beliefs. But I also don't think this offers any \\"proof\\" of anything. The basic message is \\"I am a scientist so you know I was skeptical and therefore it must have been real\\". There is no explanation for his experience. I don't doubt that he had these visions / experiences. But that does not mean it was nor does it mean it was not heaven.<br /><br />I feel a little frustrated because I got this book mainly because my mother just passed away after being in a viral meningitis coma for 8 days so I connected to the type of illness and am feeling horrible grief. I am from an agnostic viewpoint. I got frustrated because I wanted to hear more about all the knowledge imparted to the Dr. when he was in heaven. He supposedly had to write about his experiences for several nights. I get he boiled it down to \\"you are loved\\" and told us about seeing some people (wearing peasant clothes?) and a beautiful female guide on butterfly wings. But - are there more worlds than earth? Other forms of life? How old is the universe? Any other knowledge he may have received is not shared.<br /><br />I have no reason to believe anything but that the Dr. wants to share what happened to him and he is sincere. But I don't think I got any \\"proof\\" or learned anything about heaven except people may wear peasant clothes and there are dogs. As far as \\"you are loved\\" being the overall message from God, if there is a God, I know he is a loving and good God because I had my mother.

B00004T0P1|5.0|We have always felt that the film, &#34;Dinosaur&#34; has been grossly under rated. We especially loved its soundtrack! This is a replacement for a damaged copy so we didn't expect it to be somewhat of a challenge to obtain another copy in stores. That is why Amazon and it's marketplace is so important. Otherwise we would have been out of luck where we live.
B00BXDOSXS|2.0|I installed the app and it reads the videos I have on my kindle but it won't refresh when I add or delete videos from the device.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Great classic film. Daniel Day-Lewis is a great actor and Madeleine Stowe is super hot.  In addition to everything else great in this classic I'm pretty sure all you need to know about how to approach a woman you're interested in is demonstrated in the scene in the fort as he is cutting silk for gun wadding.<br /><br />He looks her dead in the eye for too long, smiling just slightly and when out of options she finally asks what he's looking at he flatly replies, &#34;I'm looking at you Miss.&#34;  Her face shows startled  surprise, then the blush of embarrassment.  She looks down slightly, gathering herself. When she looks back up to his unwavering gaze she is flush and smitten.  Only then does he silently leave.<br /><br />Confidence is conveyed not explained.  Boys brag while men tell you what they want, sometimes without saying a word.  That scene has served me well for more than two decades.

B00E7PQVHK|4.0|The puzzle based combat makes this game fun and challenging, but also takes a long time as you look for your next best move. Worked fine on my 7&quot; Kindle Fire HD, though it began to lag towards the end and the control started to suffer causing units to drop in the wrong location.
B004LWZW6U|1.0|While the first film was great cheese with humor, crazy gore, and gratuitous nudity, this sequel lowers the bar. In all three aspects, this movie finds itself deficient. Generally, the entire movie elicits a tired groan, except for one scene with Ving Rhames. That it's only 80 minutes long should tell you they couldn't come up with enough material to even make it a decent 90 minute flick. But having watched it, I wish it'd been shorter.
B00821PCJS|5.0|The special effects are quite convincing...as good as almost anything you would find in a big budget movie. The story gets more compelling as the series progresses.
B004S699HC|1.0|Following up on the heels of The Crow is a movie weakly imitates the original while ignoring the \\"supernatural rules\\" as defined in the first movie. So if you liked The Crow, avoid this cheap disrespectful knockoff.<br /><br />It's kind of Hellraiser: Bloodlines, wherein in earlier movies specific supernatural rules are established, and then those are ignored entirely because the writers don't care. So actually, avoid both of those films.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have Mahjong on my computer so I was excited to get it on my Kindle Fire. It is identical to the original version
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Reads like an action thriller movie. Never a dull moment. Not particularly realistic or believable, but that wasn't what I was looking for in the first place.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Again, Michael Connelly delivers with a great storyline. The events are realistic, and characters believeable and it's easy to get attached to them. I recommend this book.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, from their solo careers, to the Allman Brothers Band. This music powerhouse has taken my mp3 player by storm. I didn't think any album could beat Revelator, but I was happily mistaken.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Works great on our City Mini stroller. Finally--somewhere to stash drinks, keys, and phones! Should have bought this a year ago.
0307719774|5.0|This is an excellent way to record and review your thoughts. I would recommend it to anyone interested in doing the same.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|star trek into darkness was fantastic! special effects, a great cast the khan too! wow it was on the edge action.i could not want for it to come to kindle either!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The weather app was the first app I would go to. I Used to get the pollen count, videos, pictures  and more which I enjoyed and now miss. I could do without those points.
B009APMNB0|4.0|Didn't want to spend the $$$ to purchase any monitor calibration tool, but was finally convinced of the benefit. Choose this one after reading the reviews. After loading the software and waiting for it to install and then update and install and then update and then register and then (which all worked - it was just tedious when all you want to do is use what you purchased and move forward... Finally I was able to actually use the thing. At that point it worked as advertised.  I really liked the before and after shot, my monitor was leaning a little green. I also liked that I sent a photo file to the lab and was able to say - &#34;no color correction please&#34;, and my photo came back exactly the way I expected it, without it going through the eyes of the lab tech and his taste in colors.<br /><br />If you want your photo's to be exactly as you processed them and you want simple - this appears to work for that.<br /><br />I only tried installing on one machine - have no idea if this would also work on laptop.
B00915G6MG|5.0|We have enjoyed watching this series .  This season does not disappoint. Plenty of story action, drama, suspense, to see.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I can't use it at all please try to fix it Please so I will be able to use it<br />Thank you BYE
B006BFK5DK|2.0|Not what I expected from Earth Wind & Fire.  Their oldies are better.  Hope they do much better next time.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen king at his very best. Couldn't quite figure it out. I really enjoyed this book. Another one you hated to see end.
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|The game will not play on my kindle tablet. keep getting a runtime error and game won't open.  instead I get a black screen that says /users/joekauff/desktop/mosaika_ios/hud.lua:775:java.lang.out of memory error. Maybe I would like the game if I could play it.
020530902X|4.0|Having already achieved many of the primary skills required for a well written paper I found this book only relatively supplemental, however, I do believe that for those who are of the younger generation, English language learners, or who struggle with English concepts that this will definitely enhance their ability to create a well written and styled paper.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|The real magic was in piecing together an interesting trailer. Maybe I just wanted to be dazzled, maybe I just wanted to believe... What a piece of crap movie.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|It was amazing!! It is performed in universal language! Anyone could understand this movie without words or sounds. It was amazing!
0385349947|4.0|The book had good points about being more assertive in the work place, personally it was a lttile to much women's lib for me.  I'm not against women's lib just to strong for my taste.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE, WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISED. BEST ROLE FOR MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY THAT I'VE EVER SEEN. UNDERRATED FLICK
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Highly recommend this book! It was an easy read that kept we wanted to come back for more. Will definitely recommend to others.
B00DRGQZRG|3.0|I admire the horns in most Dave Holland's music, the lack of horns made it sound like fusion.. I was disappointed.
B00005LK94|4.0|I have a 5 and 8 year old and they both enjoyed the movie.  Good story and enough action to keep them interested in a non-animated film.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Satisfying and easily consumed melodrama; nicely wrapped in Brit eccentricity & classism; nice locations encouring a kind of reverie of place, fanciful states-of-mind...
B00000IQW5|5.0|Good storyline, well done. Losing a loved one is never easy, Here you also get to see what the deceased might be feeling/thinking.
B000003CMB|5.0|It's a great album by great artists/musicians. It's too bad that MOST of today's alleged artists can't play an instrument or sing on key without the aid of electronics.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|I just received the controller earlier this morning. After plugging it into the dongle and the dongle into the PS3, I gave it a quick test on a few games and noticed that the controller was dropping inputs at random in all of them. Which button input it dropped varied from game to game, but it would drop that input consistently in each of them. I figured maybe it needed to be charged and then synced wirelessly in order to work properly, so I waited for it to charge, unplugged it from the dongle and tried again, and I encountered the exact same problem with randomly dropped inputs across the several games I tested it with.<br /><br />Given that the one expectation we gamers have of our controllers is that they work, and being that the Pro Elite failed so spectacularly to meet that expectation, I'm not going to waste my time going into any detail about the build of the controller or the quality of the buttons. Just know that if you're looking for a controller that rectifies some of the Dual-Shock 3's design problems, you're better off looking elsewhere. This may appear to at a glance, but the reality of it is far, far worse than you could hope for.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that I'll be getting the ball rolling on a return as soon as I'm done writing this review.
B00CSYRHG6|1.0|This is the second copy I have ordered and both have had sound problems, you cannot hear the voices, it's like the sound has not been edited.
B00FA5MU58|5.0|When it comes to Metallica I will always give good ratings. The band sounds as good as ever. With the majority of the band approaching or in their 50's and James's voice sounding the best in 10 years. Makes for a good reduex on their own music. I will buy the movie on DVD when it comes out.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|A must have for high technology research, for which Wolfram Alpha is excellent, in all<br />Branches of science including particle physics and all mathematical levels.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|Are you looking to sharpen your dull butter knife? Can it no longer cut through butter like you need it to? Well introducing the SMITHS POS POCKET PAL MULTIFUNCTION SHARPENER!!! Oh wait there's more. it can also cut through clouds when your done sharpening it so long as you can reach that high. And cutting jello is a thing of the past! This baby makes your butter knifes annihilate that stuff. Greatest thing i ever bought.... if you want your knife to cut something a little tougher or a lot tougher i would not recommend this product.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|If you read Kite Runner and enjoyed Hosseini's story telling style, you will probably like this book. If this is the first time you read this author expect a complex story layered with politics, war, and human connection. It presents the stories of people who live in a changing country (Afghanistan), and shows the readers the lives of those who struggle to adjust to their fast changing worlds. The horrific situations the live and the heart wrenching decisions they have to make  reminds us all that it is love, compassion, and human connection what saves humanity from the evils of the world.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great product, just needs more apps!  Really wanted to be able to 'sling' a) videos shot on my iphone and b) media from VLC.
B004TI5N38|2.0|I have read several of David Baldacci's books and enjoyed them.  If this had been the first I read I would not have read any more.  The book is filled with the same old liberal anti business garbage that many of us are sick of hearing.  I am not wealthy and am not part of the coal industry but I know enough to see the bias portrayed in the book.  Not all successful people tromp on the little guy and they are not all willing to trash the environment and destroy people.  Maybe the conditions portrayed would have been valid in 1930 but today the coal industry is heavily regulated.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|His best record so far. Cannot stop listening to it. Beautiful, organic sound, full of maturity and a specific longing.<br />It really is a peek into John Mayer's life.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I received this as a gift but watching my husband try to read his face book via his phone was hysterical, so I gave it to him! Now he can read from the kindle with ease! He loves it!  I don't have time to read, so I was glad to re-gift this to him!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was my first read by this author and I was hooked by her ability to weave an engaging, thought-provoking, and intelligent story with great hooks.....that just as strongly provided rich fictional explorations of humans being interesting and yet so relatable, if not to ourselves, to someone close.  it was a rich reading experience.  So,  I loved the book and highly recommend it.<br /><br />And then came the epilogue, which almost ruined my high from having read the book.  I was just fine with how things ended....and here comes this ridiculous &#34;off-stage&#34; voice, telling us all these various what if scenarios about several main characters .....like ending the novel wasn't enough for the author; she had to throw in every thought she'd had about her characters. I found it very distracting after having just finished the book as I thought the author intended.....it was like she wanted to make sure she was on the record with every possible way these people's lives could have gone so now I'm confused as to how it actually did end and I just read it yesterday! Plus, the writing of that part seemed sloppy and disconnected to me...but not liking the whole idea might be affecting my judgement of that.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Needed new movies found online way cheaper used and have had great luck with all the ones I have got
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love the BBT! It's such a funny show and always enjoyable to watch. I recommend you buy this season!
B0090SI4OC|4.0|Standard invasion scenario. It was our world until they took it over. It was my body until they took it over. But wait there are some hold outs. They really do not have a chance. On top of that Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) becomes the hostess with the mostess by resisting her alien occupier; this will through a wrench in everyone's plans.<br /><br />It took some time to figure out why the alien good guys were so aggressive when it cane to Melanie Stryder who changed her name to Wanda.<br /><br />So we could tell the hosted from the unhosted we the hosted have strange eyes. So you can tell them at a distance the good people (depending on your prospective) wore white and drove silver; the rogues wore muted colors and drove more militant vehicles. Sort of like the old westerns with black or white hats.<br /><br />The whole story is easy to second guess as it is all standard clich&eacute;s. I have not read the book yet but something tells me it has more facets to it.<br /><br />In any event it is fun to watch the interactions between the characters and even the few chase scenes. You may even want to watch this again.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love the BBT! It's such a funny show and always enjoyable to watch. I recommend you buy this season!
B00CSA41FK|5.0|It's a hot evening in attendance apartment complex. Evidently there is no air-conditioning or self-consciousness that open windows attracts voyeurs. L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart) is wheelchair bound and board. So for entertainment he gets out his high-powered binoculars to see with the neighbors across the courtyard that conveniently leaves their blinds open are up to. Naturally he must make up scenarios as to what it is he thinks he seeing. The shocker is he believes he spotted a neighbor Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) dispatching and disposing of his spouse. He adamantly tells his girlfriend and eventually the authorities. Naturally there is no forthcoming evidence despite the incessant snooping of his girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly.)<br /><br />Could be he was wrong in his assumption. Or will Lars get Jeff and the little dog too?<br /><br />This is a typical Alfred Hitchcock movie. That this atypical, is not to say that it isn't great, and lots of fun to watch. We see more than our share of great actors including the Princess of Monaco when she was just Grace Kelly and Raymond Burr in one of his few dark character personas.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Over halfway through the first book, but the story is very interesting so far. Formatting, etc. very good for the Kindle edition.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|This story is stunning. The world building is amazing, and each of the several worlds visited has a totally different flavor. The main character is someone who it must be incredibly difficult to write, and yet Leckie does a fantastic job with it. She never lets the reader forget the character's unique abilities or disabilities, and she draws an exquisite line showing how an AI might learn to feel.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie at a great price through Amazon. I preordered this and it was quickly sent out to me after its release. Watched immediately and it was great!
B000FC10IO|5.0|Well written with empathetic characters that are intriguingly wrapped in very inventive concepts of life and death. A milestone of a new world. Brilliant.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I've just made it to level five, up till now it's been a lot of fun but all f a sudden the only assignments given are unavailable.  I am still trying to figure out what to do next but, maybe that's part of the fun.  We will see?!?!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Perfect Case.  Good Fit. The back is smooth, the design is on the inside.  Adds a Nice Look.  The case wraps around all the edges.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Good game, the graphics on this King Bubble game are the best that I have seen on a game like this. Cool version of classic game.
B005NNV044|5.0|I have always been a Pink Floyd fan but stayed away from their earlier work thinking it would be a bunch of weird stuff.  My mistake has been corrected now.  Add this to your PF collection if you don't have it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I had to load the game twice for some reason, but WOW, was it ever worth the trouble!<br /><br />Fantastic levels that had me going here, there, everywhere (sometimes more than once), with amazing graphics. The hidden object puzzles were well done, and finding objects in various scenes that were needed to make other scenes/puzzles work were fun to find/search for.<br /><br />By far, the very best HO game I've purchased, &amp; well worth the price.<br /><br />Now, I'm bummed that it's completed. Can't WAIT for a sequel. Hurry!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have to say, right now, this was the closest thing I had to owning my own horse. Really cool, dog.
B005SCSL56|4.0|It was a very good story- very original.  Though, some minor details were a bit off.  It was a bit predictable at times, but not too much.  I loved hearing the back stories of my favorite people growing up in different points of view.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Greatest game of the saga. The Graphic is very high and the game is rich of news. Play it.<br />Luciano
B007TVANDM|5.0|My children love this book. Held them throughout the story. Excellent illustrations as well. If you liked this one I would recommend this one as well: [[ASIN:B00FJHS7AE Dwarfs Giant ebook]]
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|It is a funky strategic game. I suggestivi to play it. In an hour it can catture Your will and Orly Yourcenar can do is play.
B00AW57L96|5.0|If you like books that have more twists and turns than a mountain road, this is for you.  Highly recommended
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I have never seen this show before and I love it now!!!!! great show for teens to watch. A mystery show
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There is little more I could imagine that would make access to Scripture easier.  Translations to suit almost any beginner or serious student of the Bible, easy to use look up features (especially like the alphabetical sort of the books; very helpful for those of us who did not do what our Sunday school teachers said and learn all the books of the Bible in order...that is what table of contents are for isn't it?), and a great way to begin each day with the daily verse displayed on the opening screen.  A terrific app and even if you do not use it every day as do I, you will soon find yourself using it more often as you become better acquainted with that which it holds inside.
1118109791|5.0|I signed up for the GMAT sooner than I had anticipated and thought I could just wing it without studying more than the basics. I've never been more wrong. This test is BRUTAL. I've only had 2 months to prepare, but I've already seen improvement on the practice tests I've taken. (I've also enrolled in a GMAT prep course where this edition is our 'textbook') The quantitative section is especially helpful given the number of practice problems and their explanations.<br /><br />Even if you're an above-average test-taker, you'll still need to practice to improve your score on this test, and that's what this book helps you do. Honestly, I don't see how one could take the GMAT without first cracking this bad boy open. To think I almost didn't order it - LOL!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent game, good for relaxing and unwinding at the end of a busy stressful day. Good fun when you don't want to use too many brain cells. Great for children too.
B004V9MU86|5.0|I'm not a great fan of war books but this is the most amazing book about courage love identity and unusual creative writing style, absolutely loved it!
B00F35BV64|5.0|The reboot of Star Trek is awesome. Fans and non fans of Star Trek will enjoy as the team meets Khan.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great product for my legend ear peiece. Hassle free chargeing. If you have a legend this is the place to get it.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|Score Disclaimer: I want to give this film a 10, but I will wait until I see it again for a second opinion.<br /><br />Gravity is an incredible film.  Absolutely incredible.  Peerless in direction, Gravity features career defining performances from Bullock and Clooney, absolutely stunning, top-notch special effects and incredibly effective drama that brings this seemingly simplistic idea and narrative to life.  But above all, Gravity is the most fantastic space movie ever made.<br /><br />Gravity is filled with visual splendor, and packed with layers of metaphor and meaning (much of which I am still debating with colleagues on)!  I haven't come out of a film for a long while equally blown away and perplexed, in a good way of course.  I love films that are appreciable by both audiences: those looking for entertainment (Which they will receive in spades), and those looking for a film that transcends being a film in the sleekest of ways.  Other elements of the film are peerless; the cinematography is beautiful, the minimalist score is effective, and the sound design is perfected.<br /><br />It's hard to describe my feelings towards Gravity without abusing my \\"positive adjective\\" collection, but I'll just say the Gravity is pretty darned close to perfect.  It's original, intense and very entertaining.  It's also highly re-watchable with a purpose; it's packed with genius and beauty.<br /><br />This is one perilous journey I personally want to experience over and over, deciphering it's layers and themes.  It will forever stick in my memory.  A one of a kind, incredibly exceptional experience.<br /><br />Side note: 3D usage transcends Avatar and my personal favorite of the summer Pacific Rim.  It's essential to the experience, and proves to be one of the finest in-theater experiences ever.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I definitely recommend this book to everyone.  I read it in a matter of hours, I could not put it down.
0345803485|3.0|Story is interesting. Wriritng leaves a lot toi be desired.  &#34; The Story of O&#34; mush better treatment of subject.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Another cracker from KF - will definitely buy the third in the trilogy. Love the way the fictional story is backed up by historical events.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Man, Hungry Shark just keeps evolving. But I'm having trouble getting my shark to propel high out the water. But still great game must have for the smartphone.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|My children both loved the story so much they watched it two times in a row. A new favorite for my children
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Excellent series.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This is a small but great book that gets to the essence of the creative process — and the force that impedes it. Pressfield calls it by its true name — the resistance. There is the shock of recognition in the details.<br /><br />Everyone who ever considered doing something creative  but talked themselves out of it should read this book.<br /><br />I learned of Pressfield through Seth Godin's Domino Project and the publication of a update/distillation of the ideas in this book called Do the Work.<br /><br />Read this book!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This has to be one of my all time favorite mystery games. And no it's not a BioShock knockoff. It feels original and different. The environments are beautifully done and the puzzles are challenging enough to make you really think. The storyline is intriguing and, like any good mystery, kept me guessing till the end. Another thing I love about this game is its length. Some of these HO mystery games are too easy or too short. This is just long enough to tell its story without dragging along or slowing down. Highly recommended.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|This is fun, challenging and exciting!  It is a nice change from some of my other daily regulars.  The only problem is that I have to give my husband a turn every now and then.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|Hi everyone I'm doing a review on this movie here it wasn't too bad but I thought it would be little but more funnier show you buy it. It's up to you, but it's is it worth the money right now for me if I can find it cheap around five dollars or so, then all would buy it, but the asking price right now know I will buy it just ain't worth it. I me a Few cute  scenes in it. Don't get me wrong. So if I have to give this a rating out of five stars 3 1/2 stars.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Love this book, so glad there's a sequal so I can continue on with more. This book captures you and you can't put it down.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Iron man three was better in all the other two I really like this one know if they can do their X-Men and there will green like this in Marvel comics will have some good movies, but the first X-Men it stunk the second one was either  wars the third one they should just took out and shot it. All the other Marvel movies before Iron man Thor, Capt. America and the avenger it stunk big time but the Iron man three if I have to give it a rating out of five stars I would give it eight stars. So looks like I'm going buy this one because it would be worth the money the 20 some odd dollars. So I hope you like this review and this Amazon video on command man or what ever it's called I would have give them their self a rating of five out five stars.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I was again absolutely stunt that people from a &#34;developed&#34; nation could have been so immensely cruel towards those who had so little.  And it's true in today's world as well.  It was a very confronting book and I had to put it down sometimes.  We have to read these accounts to remind us to be careful of hurting others.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good read, a little strange but it has a good story and a good ending.  I would recommend reading it for sure.
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|now I know why it was the free app of the day.  it doesn't work on kindle: slow, non responsive, shuts down on its own, etc.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It had some good twists in it and a pretty decent amount of action. Some people are so critical of new movies lately. Just sit back and enjoy the show dudes.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read this book because I had watched a few episodes with my husband on Netflix and need I say the book was so much better. I am as always dissatisfied with what Hollywood has done to a fantastic book. I enjoyed the book and life lessons from beginning to end.
B00006IX0R|5.0|Great band and at least 4 good songs on this CD...New condition and very well done...it came fast and was a good price.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|well acted, well written, excellent direction and production. I would recommend it to everyone. Don't miss this one. It is a Hit
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I ordered this c d for my 13 year old granddaughter who is a huge fan of Ariana Grande. She is enjoying it very much and can pretty much sing along with most of the songs.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|I usually love Crichton books and this one was ok but a little bit out there as far as believability goes. It has some great characters and a fast paced plot but the lack of science, even science fiction makes the story seem fake, even though we all know it is . In books like Timeline and Jurasic Park there was some feeling that it might be possible to grow dianasaurs or travel thru time, but to be shrunk down and fly little planes around Diamond Head with no flight training at all? It just seemed too far fetched. Before you buy this and I'm not saying don't, but you should read Timeline or Andromida strain. Those were great!! Hope this helps
B0052RDHTM|5.0|As usual, Follett is masterful at combining an interesting set of characters with historical events in a way that keeps readers engaged and learning.
B009PMEEY2|2.0|I feel like a lot of the 5-star reviews are fake, saying things like &quot;this game is da best; i love passing waiting time in lobbies with Azkend! loL&quot; as they don't say anything else. If you're gonna hire someone to write a fake review, at least get half-interesting output.<br /><br />The graphics are gorgeous, but unfortunately, that's about it. I can't understand why anyone would prefer this to Jumbline 2 or 1000000 when this game is almost more mindless than Bejeweled. The pattern-drawing in Azkend that one does with one's finger to connect like hexagon to like hexagon is relentlessly repetitive, and that's all the game offers. It tries to throw in other elements like bombs, locks, or frozen hexagons, but the gameplay is always the same: turn all tiles blue by eliminating same-&amp;-touching hexagons over them, and then free the talisman that drops from the top once you've &quot;blued&quot; the board by taking out the pieces under it so it can fall to the bottom for you to collect. At least, that's what the first several stages have you do. I have no idea if gameplay (hopefully) becomes more interesting later on, as I uninstalled the game after that.<br /><br />I doubt it does. The game is a no-brainer, literally. I feel I actually wasted my time on this as the free app of the day. But if you love eyecandy, go for it, because the graphics are the game's strongest point, by far.
B00AA03D18|5.0|The book was written so lay people as well as people with a medical background can understand it. My mother read it also and said she had a heaviness lifted from her. My Dad passed in 2005 and this is the first time in all that time she can speak of him without crying.  Sh e also purchased this book for two of her friends who recently lost their Daughters. As for myself this reaffirmed what I already know.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Great movie to see. t is a must see movie of the summer of 2013!! Get This One! You will love it.
0307593495|5.0|My favorite Henning Mankell novel so far. Starting the book was like reconnecting with an old friend. When it became clear that this would be the final chapter in Wallander's life, I slowed down my pace to string it out a few hours or days longer. But how could I not keep reading when the unanswered questions still had to be explained? Goodbye, Kurt. I won't forget you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is really fun me+my sister+my brother cant stop playing it! the only bad thing is they need new updates. on the Ipad u can get it whenever you want. but overall its pretty fun.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|As a wonderful series of loosely linked engrossing New Yorker articles, D&G is proof that Gladwell remains one of the preeminent nonfiction writers of our time. As a successor to the brilliant, tour-de-force classics of thesis-synthesis \\"Blink\\" and \\"Outliers,\\" D&G is pretty much a fail. It starts well, then begins meandering into a series of emotional set-pieces that are a delight to read, but seem as forced together as a picture created from combining jigsaw puzzles of a castle and a puppy. My advice - read this as though it were \\"What the Dog Saw,\\" not \\"Outliers.\\" You'll enjoy it more that way.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Life can change on a dime and the what might have been is haunting.  I found parts of it gut wrenching.  I particularly liked how the lives of each character became connected to each other.  The story was well written and easy to follow.
140006922X|5.0|Not being a religious person I was impressed by the depth of the author's historical knowledge as well as his &#34;journalistic &#34; skills that make reading vivid the title is really a little misleading .
B008JFUO4U|5.0|An intriguing story set in the future combined with A-1 special effects, plus a nice twist at the end provided a very pleasant viewing experience.
B002N44XSG|5.0|The demigod files gave me tons of information about Percy Jackson. It was very cool with his friends helping him.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Even if you did not see the first three 'Bourne' movies, you would not have any trouble following the storyline of this flick. It complimented the previous films, but was a complete entity in itself. Great action, riveting.
B008Y212PI|3.0|was on the 15x15 with only 2 completed.  opened the game the next day and my profile was gone starting me at the beginning.  very irritating.  other than that it's fun.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|AHS is one of my favorite shows. It's dark and twisted and very original! Can't wait for next season hope it's as good if not better than the first 2.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|It is the coolest app I use in my classroom!! I am so glad they had it for the kindle fire.
B009CG96QM|5.0|I'm a huge Tarantino fan, but I have to say he outdid himself with this one.  Talk about twisting reality and creating interesting characters around an already existing scenario.  He is the definition of breaking boundaries and re-imagining our world!  Pulp Fiction is ground-breaking and so out of the box, but Inglourious Basterds is a step in a different direction, yet just as bold.  If you haven't seen this movie, rent it or buy it, you will not be sorry!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Kindle makes it easy to create a book and publish it. I will defiantly be doing it again. Thanks Amazon.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|It was probably the best Star Trek adventure yet.  If you are a trekkie - you will stay one after seeing this movie.  If you weren't a trekkie - you will probably would like to become one.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|My main problem with this mouse, is just the left side. The grip is glued on as if someone used a stick of cheap glue to stick it on. The buttons on the left side are very cheap, and can be pressed by accident, simply by moving the mouse to the right with any pressure at all on the left side. The clicking feels a bit off, but it's still above regular mice. The main thing I actually dislike a lot is that the Anker logo can be customized (different colors) but the mouse wheel and DPI LEDs can't be changed, and this makes it feel werid unless you can find a color that matches with blue to always use. The DPI switch can also be hit easily, so it's best to unbind it, or to keep your fingers away.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app was amazing, I just couldn't stop playing after day 1. I just can't wait for the next update on this game, it was outstanding
B002XBVQKW|1.0|We gave up trying to watch it because the streaming signal kept stopping. I've had no problems with other HD streams.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this game it's so fun and tricky but you have to figure it out for your information you should play this game
B00BEIYP1W|5.0|The rivalry between James Hunt and Nikki Lauda though of comparatively short duration, was nevertheless one of the greatest rivalries in sporting history.  The stakes were huge: life, death, the world championship.<br /><br />Even though I did not follow Formula 1 racing then or ever, I clearly remember when this rivalry went global with badly burned reigning Formula One world champion Nikki Lauda being pulled out of a burning car at a grand prix, by his rival drivers. Almost dead from his injuries, it looked like his season if not his career was over.<br /><br />I also clearly remember watching the charismatic James Hunt being interviewed about the subject.  Considerably behind Lauda on points in the world championship, his act of getting out of the car to help rescue Lauda could have potentially ruined his own ambitions to become world champion.  Truly, this is one of the most remarkable sporting rivalries of all time.<br /><br />So, it was with more than a little anticipation that I looked forward to watching Ron Howard's take on these events done with the cooperation of Nikki Lauda.  James Hunt sadly died of a heart attack in 1993 at age 45.<br /><br />If you are like me, you do not have to be a big racing fan to enjoy this.  Everyone understands we live in a world of rivalry and competition, and Ron Howard does an admirable job in this movie in crafting one of the most memorable movies of the year.<br /><br />While I was one of the few people not very impressed with the movie Thor, there is no doubt in watching this movie that Chris Hemsworth does an awesome job as James Hunt, easily matching the charisma of the great character, who was both a charmer and a legendary womanizer, and that Hemsworth is a great star.  I consider this to be his best role to date.<br /><br />The title Rush is quite appropriate as you may experience a certain rush of adrenaline in watching the movie.<br /><br />I think the movie in a way balances perfectly, because if you are like me, as you watch, clearly as a social guy Hunt steals the show, and as a technical and methodical racer, Lauda is superior.  In a way they come across as total opposites, yet at the end one does admire both, Lauda for his heroic comeback showing what a true competitor he is, and Hunt for his charisma and skill.<br /><br />Rush is jam packed with interesting events.  You do not need I think to know much about movie going in, just allow it to rush over you.<br /><br /> I think most people will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.as you watch, clearly as a social guy Hunt steals the show, and as a technical and methodical racer, Lauda is superior.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|The hunger games was a great book. This book I'd by far will always be one of my favourite books
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Fantastic story, grips you from the first chapter.  I literally read this book overnight, hardly getting a wink because I couldn't put it down, and when I did I couldn't get the visuals out of my head.<br /><br />As a fan of Brandon Sanderson's work, none of this is surprising.  He has the ability to put the reader right next to the book, making it seem real and brings the visuals to life so well, you'd think you're watching a movie.  (which I believe the movie options for this book have already been sold.)<br /><br />Any Brandon Sanderson fan would love this book.  Any comic book lover would love this book.  Especially Michael J. Straczynski fans who like a little of dark hyper realistic fantasy element to their super heroes.  In fact, maybe Straczynski should write the script for &#34;Steelheart&#34; the movie... SOME ONE CALL HIS AGENT IMMEDIATELY.  I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was action packed!  This is not a book you would read at night to help you go to sleep!
145212308X|5.0|My young son and I absolutely love Jeffrey Brown's humor with the Star Wars' characters. This makes light of these movies - especially Darth Vader and Luke - together as son and father. Darth Vader plays the caring father to his young son and daughter. It's so funny seeing the characters in this type of setting, especially after the movies.<br />The artwork is well-done, and as I said before the humor is what really makes this product a great buy for any Star wars fan who likes to laugh.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It is not possible to believe even a single word from the book, but when you read it, it's like Percy is talking to you. I mean it is like that he is seeking there in front of you and talking to you face to face.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept me intrigued until the very end. One of those books where you want to keep reading and want to know even more.
B00FJU1HLC|3.0|It was ok, had a few funny parts but it was not that great.  I probably wouldn't care to watch it again. :(
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is amazing! My sister wont leave me alone we both love it so much! Everyone should buy it. Even my parents love it:)
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|Construction is quite sturdy and it looks cool, but I kind of got off on the wrong foot with the device.  When it arrived, I didn't have access to my Android tablet for a few days.  I was thinking I could at least try out some of the basic features, heart rate, pedometer, etc. until I got it.  No such luck.  Be aware, out of the box the device is completely useless.  It's inexplicable to me why they'd set it that way, but for whatever reason it was a paperweight for a few days.  Note that you need a Bluetooth enabled phone/tablet, the USB cable (a standard micro USB like a Kindle 3rd gen hooray!) is useless for anything other than charging.  The USB cable is also pitifully short, only a couple inches long, but again it's a standard type so cheap and easy to buy a longer one if you need.<br /><br />However once you've set it up, the device is really cool.  The size is tiny and it comes with a case so you can strap it to your arm or wear in your pocket.  You really won't notice the weight when you're carrying it around, which I suppose could be a bad thing if you're not careful and lose it, but overall is great.  You can view a fair amount of stuff on the device itself, like your heart rate or distance/time of your run.  The other stuff you can use the linked application on your phone/tablet, like the sleep monitor, are neat things to know.  It's fun to see biometric data.<br /><br />It's a good device, a bit pricy, but not bad considering what it does, comes with, and battery life.  It could be made a bit more convenient with basic functions available out of the box and if it did have PC compatibility, but they're minor gripes in the grand scheme of things.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love coin dozer i love coin dozer i love coin dozer i love coin dozer i love coin dozer i love coin dozer i love coin dozer.<br /><br />  AND DID I MENTION THAT I LOVE COIN DOZER!
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Two strong men who displayed a hunger for adventure, achieved it in this film. Their immense courage and final selfless act, made it all too real. This is way beyond your Hollywood movie.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Was definitely a Stephen King story.  Not to be read before going to bed. He is one of my favorite authors.
B001YYQ9SS|1.0|Final Fantasy VII was already a terribly overrated game, but even so, this movie adds nothing to it's own namesake. The villains are people we've never seen before and have never been mentioned in previous media, the story is just reteaching the main character lessons he already learned in the game, the other characters from the game barely get any screen time barring Tifa, and the final battle didn't was just a ham-handed excuse to bring Sephiroth back so the fans can gush some more. The visuals are nice, but you need more than style to make a movie. This has no substance to it. It's a pointless addition to a mediocre story. Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children Complete is a movie that serves no purpose beyond pleasing the fans and I still can't even say it does that well, because the other playable characters from the game barely even get to do anything. If you aren't interesting in seeing more of Cloud, Sephiroth, or three new characters never before mentioned and who, indeed, will never be mentioned again, skip this one. It won't draw you in and it won't impress.
0141439580|5.0|Jane Austen at her best. This is her most fun novel. From start to finish it's a delight. Romantic novels don't get any better than this.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is very fun. You get to build your own city and run it and expand. Its a really fun game I reccommend it to everybody
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The author writes in a very catchy realistic way that makes the story seem real rather than trashy like some romance books.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher stories while &#34;predictable&#34; in that he's going to get wrapped up in something dangerous and interesting, are never boring or transparent in how he actually gets to a resolution. If you liked previous stories from Lee Child, you will enjoy this one too.
0316236535|5.0|Super cute book! Great for lessons on describing attributes. It is also going to be a fun one to read for halloween.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|This is a great movie with a  good number of star cameos. Lots of good humor along with a good plot. Production quality for the time it was made was great.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Good book. One of those you just have to keep reading. Couldn't wait to get back to it. Great characters who I loved getting to know.
B00CEZJT2E|3.0|I purchased this to serve as a backup battery for a Samsung Galaxy S4 on long flights. It works as advertised and I have no problem with it's capacity and slim design. The only issue I do have though is that the micro-USB plug is designed with a boxy attachment that prevents it from being inserted into anything but a bare phone. If your phone has a case you MUST take it off to use the micro-USB plug since it is so large and the connector isn't long enough to go through a case.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I can't believe I didn't review this when I first read it years ago. It was so moving, that even though my friends have often accused me of being a Vulcan, I sat in my chair and just simply bawled out loud for at least fifteen minutes. I just re-read it on my Kindle app and I had to mop up the waterworks again!<br />What a moving story by a really amazingly talented writer! I have also read most of his other works since I first discovered him and I very much love them, too--especially the one about the boy and the playing cards--I can't come up with the title right now, but he's directed to different places to help people in various ways.<br />Using Death as the narrator in The Book Thief was a truly inspired idea and opened up many avenues that would not otherwise allowed the story to work so well. This Zuzak is a genius!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I have been informed about the evils of some orphanages in the past in Ireland, but I have never been shown the effects of such evil on one person in a finely woven fabric of realistic detail. I was transported to a different time and place, and immersed in the lives of the characters. It was a powerful and moving experience.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This cd is amazing, I was happy that it arrived on the release date as promised. As with most NIN CDs they have unique packaging and hesitation marks is just as good as the rest, sound quality is amazing, I have recommended this cd to everyone. Go buy it!!!
B0031RS8NK|5.0|So often you hear books described as &#34;just a bit of fluff and fun&#34; but Sophie Kinsella has a wonderful way of bringing both her characters and their affairs to life.&#34;Twenties Girl&#34; is a another story that instantly hooks you and allows you to dive straight into vivid memories of the roaring twenties. A wonderful read of two girls (ok one girl and a ghostly 23 year old great aunt who recently died at the age of 105), separated by age and circumstance learning to face life with a radiant smile, a cocktail in one hand and a manta of &#34;Tally Ho!&#34;
B000JMKRKC|5.0|A fabulous story, one of the best books I have read. Great characters and story lines....don't want to write a spoiler, so I'll just say try it!
B005VGUA5S|5.0|I bought this on a whim as I usually listen to other types of music and I was surprised how much fun this CD is.  My 21 year old son in college has been captivated by it too.  He has never really heard any of the older tunes and they were new to him.  He plays it all the time now.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The most recent upgrade was definitely a few steps down. I don't need games to play in order to get the weather, and information is more difficult to find. Just give us the facts please and keep it simple.
B000FCKPHG|3.0|The has a good premise, but it is repetitive.  The scenarios discussed are interesting, but the same material is repeated over and over again.
B000QK7YQ2|5.0|Watched when I was 22 in the theatre.  Campy by todays standards but it shows the intro to motorcycling as a lifestyle and fun hobby.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I can relate to this movie because I am of the same age as most of these actors.  I received it in record time and am enjoying it greatly.
B008Y73XTQ|3.0|you never know...try it and see.  You might like it.  I just felt it was not going anywhere and moved on to another movie.
B0096HKZ1M|5.0|What is not to love, mad scientists, the recently un-dead, boobs, a story by H.P.Lovecraft himself! a glorious example of 80's horror.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like this game. It's only 60 seconds per round so you have to be fast to get a high score. The only down side of this game is that you have to buy power boosts in order to get the highest score in the world. If you are just looking for a fun casual game you will like this one.
B003O2RQKI|5.0|I have many recordings of Beethoven in LP,CD and DVD,but this one is really fantastic. Lan Lang's playing is vigorous and passionated, maybe a bit too much on the \\"dynamics\\" side,but I think Beethoven would have liked to hear it or at least since it was Beethoven to see it played !<br />The image of the buray is perfect and the sound of the piano is clear and full bodied. Here I disagree with one of your reviewers who complained about the lack of bass.This may be due to one's sound equipment.<br />A very good buy!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Felt like a roller coaster, with all the suspense, twists and turns!!!  Can't wait to read again! You will enjoy!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I am frankly amazed at the infamy!  This is a love story with ( in the first two books). Two<br />light BDSM episodes.  Sweet-not purient
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|omg in 16 and my daughter is 1 she LOVES this game thanks wonder zoo: animals and dinosaur rescue BYE!!!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Never thought I'd become addicted to a show about a motorcycle club, but I have. Wow.  Kurt Sutter is a genius and the cast is amazing.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|I can't believe how great this movie is.  I'm going to see it over and over, because it's one of those movies you'll never want to forget.
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|It is dum that you have to have a facebook inorder to use this app.They should put just for facebook users.
B00FEN000S|4.0|This is a pure action film. If you are looking for a touching, heart rending story of love and heartbreak, this is NOT the film for you. Even though they tried to add some of that into the story. This is a pure SLUGFEST! Strangely, guys kind of like that anyway. So, I liked it. I guess this has confirmed that I am all dude!
B001U887M4|5.0|I use these as garden shoes when I work out in the yard.  I love them.  It is a little annoying that the lining pulls out when you take the shoes off, but aside from that, I love these shoes.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really enjoying this game. It is a bit frustrating waiting for more energy, but I like the variety and the puzzles. Polly
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love the work out ! Quality of DVD was perfect.<br />Ive lost 16 pounds doing this work out :)
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Good show, but somewhat unbelievable, especially the wife's attitude towards her husband and the husband's return to the public eye as if he didn't do anything wrong. Reminds me of Clinton!
B005XLN97M|5.0|Got this for my 3 year olds bday- very reasonable, big enough and lots of parts to keep her busy with it- not too tricky to put together either
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game with a variety of minis. But it's mainly a hidden object game. You go through various scenes finding objects based on name, silhouette, and other descriptors. You gather different objects to complete collections. It's timed and uses a monetary system for lives, advancing, etc. It's like Sugar Crush in that way.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Loved the series, great cast and lots of interesting characters. I hope Starzs can create another show like this soon.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was the best book ever. This story is about August Pullmans journey through middle school.<br /><br />On this adventure August makes life long friends including Jack will summer Dawson and Amos the jock. Read this book... OR ELSE!!!!!
B000FC12L4|5.0|I've been really enjoying this series. I also really liked the same author's Keys to the Kingdom series. Fun and engaging.
B00DKY4NBA|5.0|One of the best albums of the year.  These guys have a very unique sound and keep putting out great original music.  Only better album is Humbug.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|It was a little slow getting started, but then I began to get \\"into it\\".<br />I found the book very interesting, very descriptive, and easy to read.  When I finished I was eager to read more by this author.  The use of the French language without translation was annoying, but did not really distract from the story.  I shall look forward to reading the next Maggie book.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Used to be five stars. But now it just won't work. Needs to be fixed SOON. I have people to talk to.
B00004TDTO|5.0|My grandkids had never seen this movie so I bought it as a gift. They loved it! Scared the living daylights out of them. I think they'll look at sharks in a different light.
B00C9G22R2|3.0|kinda boring and im a big martial arts fan to much story not enough fighting but the fight scenes are great
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so in love with pinterest!! I only wish there were more hrs in the day, so I could browse to my hearts content! But then reality comes knocking on my door... &quot;come back to earth, you have important things to do!&quot; she says!  ;-)
B004UID2LC|1.0|lots of problems it freezes the screen blocks you out of using the player and when it does work it only works for 5 minutes
B00E6Z0THE|2.0|I downloaded this game and when it tells me to tap play an error pops up and says I do not own this game. Now my internet is working fine and I paid 99cents for it and how do I not own it??. So until this gets fixed I will only give 2 stars. I would love to play it so can u please fix it?
B0063M22QO|5.0|really enjoy passing the time with this game. makes the time go by so much faster. Not to mention,  it is so worth the money! Great great game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Couldn't get any better. Only thing is I wish energy didn't run out so fast and maybe you could switch between ma and pa.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Its really realistic easy and hard at the. Same time I like it I got it when it was the free game of the day
B00D2K40WY|4.0|It is fun but it sucks that you need to write a review to continue to receive free updates really?
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn's Last book before he died. I have read every one of his books.He will be truly missed,If you have not read any of his books, I guarantee once you start,you will be hooked forever. HIs main man is MItch Rapp. A true American Hero who removes EVIL where it is needed to be removed,quickly. Even though Vince Flynn is now deceased at age 47, which I am still in shock over, I wish and I hope one day that someone smartens up soon and makes either a tv Serial or a motion picture starring MItch Rapp. I guarantee every one and every body, will fall in love with Mitch Rapp. He is cool,cool, cool without a doubt!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love the game!!!! It takes time to get things done. Post everything on Facebook. You will love it too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You can tell a lot of time and effort was put into this game. It is very complex and entertaining!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|becouse its avoid game in thud site and I so gabby to play it in nh tablet good good hood flood
B00594XOZU|2.0|I use to go on kik on my kindle but now it won't work I deleted almost everything but it didn't work I deleted kik numerous times and still nothing
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Dumb Ways to Die is an EPIC game! I love how you can watch the music video once you unlock enough points. Now the song is stuck in my head. Whoever invented this game is genius.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is really fun and amazing. But I can't figure out how to update it. That's why I only rate it 4 stars.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love this series. Nathan Fillion has a wonderful sense of comedic timing, and I've always enjoyed shows with a great ensemble cast.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I was not sure what I would get considering the price, however when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised. It was just what I was looking for.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I was really enjoying the first half of this book.  Then, something went wrong.  It feels as if the publisher asked for filler as convoluted and dramatic without-reason as what we endure prime time tv.  Hoping the next book returns to purpose.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Kept me busy for a few hours. Taxed my brain quite a few times! Would recommend to anyone who loves escape games.
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|...nothing new, but very well written, gives plenty of ideas to effect change. If you didn't read other books like this, then it is a must read.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Actually, I was surprised by this version of Dredd. I thought it would be a rehash of the Stallone script but it was nowhere near it and this time it was done right. This film didn't waste much time in character development which is what you want in a futuristic high tech problematic society setting with lots of violence. Imagine Blade Runner directed by Quentin Tarantino; the atmospherics were excellent and the violence unrestrained. Kind of an interesting touch that you never see Dredd's face. Definitely not for the kiddies.
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|I have been using various releases of Lightroom for several years but never took the time to truly learn how to use all of the functions.  Scott Kelby's book has finally provided a &#34;start to finish&#34; guide for the great program presented in a very understandable, complete format that is easy to follow.
B002DD67XG|5.0|Fell in love with my husband listening to this album. &#34;How Sweet It Is&#34;, &#34;Shower The People&#34; and &#34;You've Got A Friend&#34; bring me back to those days.
B00002R0MC|5.0|I would strongly recomend this product.  This music never ages. I sounds just as fresh as it did 20 years ago.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|As someone who travels quite a bit, I find myself spending many nights in hotel rooms all over the country. When I first heard about the \\"travel friendly\\" Chromecast I was very excited. Finally, there would be a portable, super-lightweight way to stream Netflix (and now Hulu) content to the hotel TV. In theory, this should have been the perfect device for me.<br /><br />When  hooked to a TV via both HDMI and USB (for power) this little dongle is fantastic. You simply log into the Chromecast app on your phone, configure the Chromecast to access the network, and off you go! This works great at home, but almost never works on the road.<br /><br />The Problem:<br />Nearly every hotel in the country now uses \\"Captive Portals\\" for their Wifi access. These captive portals are basically webpages that come up when you first connect to the hotel's \\"open\\" network. The pages usually serve as a way to pay for internet access, display terms of use or both. Even hotels with \\"free\\" internet access use such pages. Because ChromeCast doesn't have a browser built in, it can never get past the authentication pages of these captive portals.<br /><br />Kludgy Solutions:<br />1. Travel with a Travel router. Not all hotels have ethernet ports, but for those that do, you can take along a travel-router. You connect the router to the ethernet, then connect to the router's wireless signal with any other device. When you authenticate on the captive portal, every device hooked to your private wifi are now authenticated... chromecast included. This works great for hotels with internet, but is kludgy and cumbersome. I feel ridiculous dragging a router to a hotel that has wifi.<br /><br />2. Use your computer's internet sharing as a router. If you have your PC or Mac with you can bridge network connections to make the computer behave much like a travel router: Same as #1.<br /><br />3. If you get really fancy, you could temporarily spoof the MAC address of the Chromecast using another computer... Authenticate, then hook up the Chromcast to the wireless network on which its MAC is now authenticated.<br /><br />Bottom line: In order to be of any use for travelers, Google needs to come up with a solution for the Captive Portal problem.

B000050HTO|5.0|What can you say about this title?!??!? Dylan is great and always has been. It's a great album if you like his music.

B00H83EUL2|5.0|&#34;Gravity&#34; is an entertaining thriller, a survival story in space. What makes this movie different from its many predecessors, including &#34;Marooned&#34; and &#34;Apollo 13&#34;, is the stunningly realistic recreation of being weightless in space. And somehow, the movie manages to endow this environment, poised in orbit between a colorful earth and the limitless black void of space, with a surprising degree of claustrophobia.<br /><br />The premise is simple. A U.S. space shuttle delivers a four-person crew to orbit to repair a satellite. Senior astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) and medical engineer (and rookie astronaut) Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are on a spacewalk, working on the damaged satellite. Suddenly, Mission Control in Houston (the voice of Ed Harris) warns that a debris cloud from a destroyed Russian satellite is approaching at speed...<br /><br />The collision between debris cloud and space shuttle is catastrophic. Kowalsky and a terrified Stone find themselves in desperate straits, untethered and with few options. How their dilemma is resolved is the exciting and frightening heart of the movie, a series of action sequences that should keep most viewers glued to their seats.<br /><br />Bullock and Clooney do a great job in what is essentially a two-person movie. The action moves fast enough to get most viewers past some plot holes. &#34;Gravity&#34; is an afternoon's excellent entertainment, and recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|When did we go from human to kinda mutt central and dang those pods be crazy you know you gotta look out for them I started to read these books after watching the movie last summer and they were awsome totally recommend them to anyone
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Movie was fun to watch , very entertaining.  Might watch for a second time eventually. Would recommend to a friend.
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I was debating getting an iusbport for an upcoming vacation to use with my iPad and to have wireless access to my cameras sd card, when I discovered the Kingston's Mobilelite Wireless.  The Mobilelite Wireless has most of the functionality I was looking for, and is currently half the price of the iusbport, and so far has has good reviews.  I've also always found kingston memory reliable, so I thought I'd take a chance.<br /><br />Size wise it's slightly smaller than my iPhone 5 in it's Otterbox Defender, a little larger without the case.  Unlike most of the pictures, sd cards don't stick out at all, and sit flush in the Mobilelite.  SD cards click in like in camera, and you have to push them in again to remove them.  My only real complaint so far is the power switch, which is a pressure switch and has to be pressed in hard to turn on or off.  A button switch or slider might be a better choice, but I'll reserve my judgement if the switch holds up to normal use.<br /><br />On the good side The Mobilelite is very easy to set up and configure.  Kingston has some nice videos available on there website to show you how.  I had it set up and running with my iPad and iPhone in a few minutes.  I loaded a variety of files onto a 64gb sd card, and was able to access them without a problem.  The USB port on the Mobilelite worked fine with a flash drive, and I was able to copy and move files between the sd card and the flash drive.  I was even able to plug in a 500gb Western Digital Passport drive using a USB y cable plugged into a power source.  Finally, I was able to stream 2 movies from the sd card to the iPad and iPhone simultaneously without a problem.<br /><br />All in all I'm very satisfied with the Mobilelite.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Homeland is so intense, I almost can't watch it.  But it's so gripping, I can.  And Claire Danes:  Amazing actress.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I can only confirm what Nassim Taleb says in the introduction: this book should supersede Freud's &#34;The Interpretation of Dreams&#34; as the psychology classic. Kanheman takes us through a breath-taking tour of experimental psychology focusing on where our gut feelings fail. After reading, you will never see the world (or yourself) in the same way. All while getting a glimpse into the mind of a genius.<br />I read the book in one swoop taking notes then re-read a year later and am planning to read it at least a third a time to savour it fully and imbibe its lessons.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|One hell of a movie finally the bad guy wins out this is a Robin Hood type movie I hope you all will order it and enjoy
B008BU75IQ|4.0|As usual one never knows where the story will go, and just as exciting to read as all the other Clifton stories.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I've played this game on miniclip and loved it and now I can take it on the go I can log in with my miniclip account and have my stats and coins there very fun game I recommend downloading and playing as a guest then when you feel that your good enough then make an account and challenge your friends and enter tournaments
B008ALAHA4|5.0|After selling my old Macbook Pro and replacing with an Air, I was surprised to find that the Air had a different charging port that rendered all of my wall chargers useless. Then along comes the converter and voila, I'm back in business without having to pay $100+ for new chargers! Some other reviews mention the converter falling out way too easily but despite tripping over my cables (several) times, its never pulled out and instead the entire charger+converter section comes out as intended. For the small price, this converter does exactly what I expect and very well.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|This product is of outstanding quality and does everything that I could possibly want from a case.  It protects my kindle yet isn't so bulky that I can't just put it in my purse and go.  The color ensures that I can always find it - no matter where I may leave it.  The price and delivery were outstanding on this item.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for an excellent kindle case.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|this is a very awesome game. i am so so addicted . i play every day and every single night
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I guess my son will like it in about 15 years because I will tell him I like it then.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. I loved the mystery Mr. Gray gave the book omg he issuper sexy!!!!
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|Mads Mikklesen makes this movie perfect. Even better is to watch Hannibal Rising first. You then will understand Hannibal series much better. Mads is doing such a great job pulling us into his world. You begin to feel sorry for H. We know H. gets caught eventually, so all we can do now is hope this series goes on! EAT THE RUDE!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I have been a hard core Trek fan for over 30 years and can honestly say that I think that this is the best Trek yet.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|When in Rome, do as the Romans do: Watch ROME series! No offense, but this beats reading about it!! The actors are what makes this movie worth watching.
B004APVI1G|5.0|A great movie in 3D just one of my favorite and my friends love it also. You have to see this movie for your selfs
B001RMYWG8|4.0|Well told story and well acted too. Really gives you a feel of what late 60's early 70's NYC police life was like. Wish they made more like this.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Helps the first book of the series to gain insight and better explains the situation. Wish Gale. Played a more active roll in this book.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|This is a cute little counting game with  levels of skill which would be fun to play with little grandkids.  Even if they have a short attention span you can have a quick little session or a ,longer one.  I downloaded it to my tablet so that when I see my little grandchildren I can have a fun and educational play with them. Some reviews mention the lack of the caterpillar.... he is always at the bottom of the page, though small.  I did think that if it mattered, you could either draw the caterpillar onto the pointing finger of the child or make a simple finger puppet.
B004QBWU02|4.0|What can I say: a blast from my past that is always fun to watch, and doesn't have a lot of what Hollywood considers 'entertaining' today.
B00E7SFAAG|1.0|This totally sucks was it of money to hard terrible graphics and is terrible on<br />Kindle! Hard controls and the instructions make no sence! DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!!! If it let me I would rate it 0!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions. They are so cute and they make me laugh. The game passes time by and it's a challenge.
B00009NQQO|4.0|Adorable. Bought this for my 6 month old  nephew and he loves it. He is quite the little fisherman already.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I like the zombie genre. I had high hopes for this book. I found it interesting but not as engaging as I had hoped. Not a fan of the documentary style. Individual stories were too short. I never got a clear overall view of the world at war.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I bought this film expecting a movie that would be at least as good as the previous one, and it turns out that was a mistake. I loved the first one, and I wanted to like this, but bad writing killed that for me, as well as some really big plot holes. Maybe the next one will be better. I'll be sure to rent it first though.
0143122916|5.0|I could not put this book down. It is amazing to realize how insulated and naive we really are as Americans.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik was amazing until........there's always that but we'll this one is that it won't let me login. I am not going to just let it stay they need to fix something.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book didn't grip me as much as the first but over all am glad the series lives up to the hype
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It was great until the most recent view change. Its touch response is a huge pain. Takes minutes just to set an alarm time.
B002TVBU1Q|5.0|Having collected Beatle and Apple Records for over 35 years I was compelled to purchase Abbey Road for the 100th time. Never opened so I can't confirm if the sonic value of the disc is any good or if the shirt fits. But a nifty little package.
B0077ATSSQ|2.0|I was SO disappointed in this movie as so was my husband. When we saw the previews the movie looked like it was going to be such a heartwarming movie. In my eyes as well as my husbands eyes it was not all that it was cracked up to be.
B00821OX98|4.0|A very good show.  It has been a while since King has provided something substantial.  This show is like the 80's King.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|It's Star Trek, what else is there to say?  Kirk and Spock and the whole cast really are great yea!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Provides a more realistic, all encompassing look at what would happen if a zombie apocalypse were to happen. Great read.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|It's perfect! Great moral lessons scattered here and there, clean, and just plain a feel good series to watch! Wish it was more than 4 seasons!
B003V5CFV8|5.0|In recognizing any humanitarian deficiencies  we possess as a society, we are alerted personally of our quick call to judge individually in this film..I recommend it as a lesson for the ages!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I'm a grandma and still love listening to Bruno!  A good difference in songs.  They don't all sound the same.
0788859544|5.0|When I first watch this movie I was in middle school. I am a guy, even though this is a type of movie that girls like, I loved it. I wish I was prince Eric! This movie is very touching.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i just got my android and I play this game on pc. for some reason pocket edition feels funner to me
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Tony stark kicks ass and shows why even without the suit he is Iron Man.  A good follow up after the Avengers.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|This story is not big, with lots of plot twists, but I love the descriptions of English village life among the aristocrats. I enjoy learning about this particular lifestyle with its high level of civility.
B009LDD54K|3.0|It was pretty good. Season 2 has been the best so far. A dude nufe running down the hall with a dog leash after being attempted to be killed during choke sex. Uses the naked women and her tits as his sheild. Weird. Season 3 was ok though.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Incredible series...intelligent, funny, sexy! Each show is like watching a full length film.  Can't wait for season 3! BBC is my new favorite network.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|very in depth story and (props) didnt like not having English,i usually turn off!!!  had to finish,need more like this
B004EF65QA|4.0|I could not stop watching North and South...it is a wonderful historical drama to enjoy on a cold rainy day.  Richard Armitage is sensational as Mr. Thorton.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Kindle fires only register two fingers on screen. Five stars if you can turn that game off. Besides that, I really love this game!
B005Y0OFVG|5.0|Read this book when I was a teenager and loved it.  Thought I'd get it for my kindle and read it again and loved it all over again.
038533348X|5.0|Vonnegut is always a great read.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a very entertaining and addicting game!!  Love it, and think about my next break so I can get back to it!  Highly recommend it to Mahjong players!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to set up and use. Was looking for an alarm clock on my iPhone and decided to look on my kindle instead...that's when I found this little gem :)
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was awsome it helps me understand words I don't know or I don't understand because I'm one of those people that love reading
B0055ISACW|5.0|Well done. This opera will leave you a little shaken. The theme is brilliantly portrayed. The music and the singing is quite good and the staging is adequate.<br /><br />The acting sometimes misses the mark as it is hard to discern the emotion being portrayed. Crazy? Scared? Insecure?<br /><br />This production deserves your attention if you're ready to go beyond Figaro and Aida and have tasted Wagner, then try this modern piece. I'm very glad I bought it.<br /><br />For clarification: This refers to the Muti conducted La Scala version as pictured here.
034580404X|5.0|I love these books and the fact they came cheaper for all three on this site than I found one on most I am thrilled. Will recommend these to others as well as the site.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has many layers! Can't wait to discuss at my book club. Great insight into how the human psyche rationalizes its decisions it makes and why.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|This is cute, but is mostly just a time waster. I like to show it to my grandchildren and let them play with it, but even they get bored with it pretty quickly.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Colorful characters , great plot, fun with magnificent imagery. A must read of the times, page turner from beginning to end.
B00A757EFW|3.0|But I still like playing this game.  Can't win because I have trouble with my finger joints cramping up.<br />But I still enjoyed trying.....
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One of the loveliest books I have ever read. Poignant and heart wrenching but, in its own way, hopeful. The characters pull you in right away.  Excellent book....a MUST READ.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|To e mail to others or post to face book.  I was on top of specials ,notes and information I need to remember or share.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The plot twists and turns.  The secret is a shocker!  Through it all, human kindness prevails.  Hard to put down.
B004I744AS|4.0|As well as using in sentence.  I would say to myself  is this correct, did I use this well, expecially when I am<br />Typing in noes on my tablet.  How do  transfer this to all of mt tablets.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|The kids love Tom the talking cat. After awhile it aggravates me,  but hey if it keeps them entertain in a different room, go for it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You will not be disappointed with this game. Even if you don't pay for any of the upgrades, there are plenty of earnable in-game enhancements that will keep you interested for a long time. One of the best free games I've ever played. Thanks!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Megan and Connor both end up in Vegas. She is there for her cousin Gail' s wedding. He is there with his best friend, Jeff, putting memories of a failed relationship behind him.<br /><br />When Megan approaches him and asks him to walk her out of the bar--just to shut up her friends--he seizes the opportunity to turn their chance meeting into a memorable night. Only it becomes much more.<br /><br />Megan has given up the dream of finding Mr. Right and has decided to turn to artificial insemination to have the family she's always wanted. Connor, too, wants the family he lacked as a child. Only he's looking for a business-like merger between two like-minded individuals. And he believes he's found that with Megan. When she wakes the next morning--married to Connor--she has no recollection of all the reasons their marriage was so logical. He sets out to convince her it makes sense for them to be together. She teaches him about love along the way.<br /><br />There were so many things to love about this story. Megan--the heroine whose heart was recently broken. Connor--the sexy, adorable hero whose difficult upbringing has made him determined to succeed and left him with a strictly pragmatic view of relationships. Ms. Kelly's unique voice--warm, funny, sexy, and deeply emotional. They all blend to create the perfect romance. I am an instant Mira Lyn Kelly fan and I can't wait to read her next one.
1594744769|5.0|This is a very good story and the photos are awesome. I think it would<br />make a great M. Knight Shambala movie!
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|I bought for 7 dollars and then i tried to download it worked then the second download that the game requires it said i don't have enough space and i barely have anything so please fix this or give me my money back it did the same for modern combat 3 and it got fixed but im just reminding u guys to please fix it (P.S i have a kindle fire so can u fix it for that ;) )
B00003CX5P|5.0|The DVD was in very good condition and came in the original packaging.. I was pleased with the purchase and the price.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great book! easy exercises, I have shared it with everyone. would recommend everyone read. I use it daily , amazing.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|KHANNNNN is best way to put it only way to do it is jims worst adversary khan a must see
B007REV4YI|4.0|More character development allowed Craig who is a fine actor.  Bardem as the villian does a great job.  Sorry to see Judy Dench being killed off.  A good action movie - classic Broccoli format.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|We have windows xp.  The ads did not mention this fact.  It is written on the box in very fine print that xp is not compatible.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is an awesome game that is very afflicting. I love solving the puzzles and getting a prize by the picture being revealed.
B00792EGES|5.0|GREAT. ALL AROUND. I'D LOVE TO SEE THIS BAND IN THE FUTURE. STAY AWAY FROM CREED. GO ALTER BRIDGE.  BUY IT.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|While reading this book their were points when I got into the book and those times were very few. This book did not capture my attention throughout the book I found parts of it boring and uninteresting hopeful the second one is better then the first one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|And reading it after seeing the movie a while ago makes it even more interesting!<br />When the battle begins, it's very hard to move away from the book!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book explored some fascinating research on the neurological and cultural basis for personality type.  As a teacher, I have long felt that those who do not feel comfortable with large group work need to work in a style that is comfortable to them.  We will not attain excellence in education until we value those who have the gift of introspection. We need to find ways to value and honor the quiet pursuits that are often at the core of creativity and innovation.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|It moves along. Nice twists and turns. The costuming and scenery are first rate. These are the first two episodes I have seen of this series.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is the best book I've read in years, especially for those of us who grew up in the 80s and can so closely identify with the themes and music of that era, which are reflected in some aspects of the story.  I think the book's description does this book a disservice, but what you, the reader, will find is that you'll be captivated from the first page to the last.  It's an epic adventure, with vivid characters in a fascinating context.<br /><br />As soon as I finished this book I began to tell everyone to read it.  For a couple friends, I even purchased copies.  Not one who has read the book has anything less than enthusiastic praise for it.<br /><br />I will say, on the slightly negative side, I thought the mindless &#34;we've been lied to&#34; theme regarding God was a bit over the top.  And the &#34;F&#34; bomb gets dropped a tad too often for my tastes.  This is a book that kids could enjoy too, but the overly harsh rhetoric against religion and the foul language should give parents pause for kids who are under high school age.<br /><br />But for those who can keep these elements in perspective, I think you'll love this book.  I hope we see a sequel, or other books from this author.
B00BEIYN3M|5.0|For the past 3 years I've been dealing with all of the stages of grief that come from losing my wife to breast cancer. So, going into this movie I was not skeptical--I had FORGOTTEN how to laugh.<br />The first time I watched it I laughed so hard at some points I cried and almost peed my pants.<br />I had to watch it a second time one week later to hear the parts I missed because I was laughing SO hard...and I still laughed! Know I'm sayin? lol<br />Some say this is dumb comedy but I disagree! I HATE dumb.<br />There is some very clever dialogue in this movie and you really need to be intelligent to appreciate it!<br />There are very few movies that I will actually buy--but this is one of them. In my book this will always be entertaining to watch!<br />I am buying this one!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I have Sennheiser 598 cans along with the Fiio E17 and the Fiio amp. I hear things I have never heard before. Before you compare you need to make sure you have headphones that will make use of the DAC. The amp did not add much over the small amp in the e17. Apparently it would if I had high impedance headphones that require a lot of power but mine do not require that much power. Edit: My original E17 died. I used the soundcard of my computer and the E9 amp. The sound was horrible compared to the E17 Dac. You can get the best computer soundcard money can buy but it will always sound horrible compared to a Dac for the following reasons. Number one, a computer is designed to run spreadsheets and play video games and browse the internet and when it finally gets done doing that it finally gets around to playing your music. As a result you hear a lot of static computer noise. Also, when your computer clock is required to run your video game, it makes the sound card wait and that makes the music sound funny. This DAC fixes both of those problems. The advantage of the E9 amp is that it has its own dedicated power supply. The USB power to the DAC alone suffers from variable power to the USB again affecting music output. I missed the sound I had with the combo, so I bought a refurbished E17 and am back hearing the sound I was used to. I can't fault the original E17 going bad because I listen to music every time the computer is on and used it continuously for several years.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Loved all of the old school action stars in one place! Needed more Jet Li! Can;t wait til Expendables 3..
2090338482|4.0|Quite a few grammatical errors inside that should not have been allowed to pass the editor's desk. Not done by a French person.
B00969PR18|4.0|It found some far off corners of the world that I know of very well. It surprised me. I love looking at maps. Geography was one of my favorite studies and I'm always going and looking for a map. So to have it at my fingertips is great.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This movie is made for fans of science fiction/ fantasy/ mechs/ Godzilla!  It doesn't waste time with some hidden save this or that message but goes straight to the action giving fans what they really want, heroes acting heroic and kicking monster butt!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app all the time better then a note pad. Because I can be on my laptop working and need to remember something and can add it to a list then go to the store and have the same list on my phone to get groceries or other items. I can use it from my desktop and my kindle.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|This band is incredible. Their harmonies are beautiful! Their instrumentals are equally as good and really catchy too! Great band!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is TOO much fun!!!!! Love it! And the weekly tournament's are great.. The grandchildren LOVE it too! FUN for the whole family!
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|The two leads in this flick do a marvelous job.  Anthony Hopkins is spot on and Helen Mirren plays his long suffering wife to good effect. The movie is not boring as some claim, It's about Hitchcock trying to make \\"psycho' and he does it on  his own money basically.  The supporting cast is good too. With scarlet johansen doing a fine job of playing the underrated Janet Leigh. Janet was a fine actress and did a great job in every movie she ever did , she even added class to the silly 'night of the lepus' in 1972!.  It would be interesting to see a biography of Hitchcock but this is still worth watching in hd. Or on blu ray.  You get a slice of his life here and of his wife's life. I liked this one better than \\"the girl' which made hitch a little more lecherous. I am sure he was domineering over his starlets , which is touched on in this film. His relationship with Vera Miles is featured in this film as well. She was a starlet that stopped working to take care of her kids for a while.  It's a balanced feature film , in that regard. This is a pleasing little film and if you take it as that and don't expect action scenes , you will enjoy it.
0553565915|5.0|After the passing of my Mother, I wanted to understand anything I could regarding death and Heaven. This book helped me visualize where she is.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|great movie. rented in HD and quality was excellent. Gives you 2-3 days to watch as the movie is long.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This game is ok.It is fun to make the food but do some foods take 22 hours to make.It would be more fun if you could serve the food to the customers.I don't think it is fair that you need a internet connection.(:
B00DQR26EC|5.0|I am an old school rpg fan and doom and destiny delivers the fun.  Simplistic but exciting I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys sword and board rpg.
140006922X|5.0|It's a fun read, full of history and context for the Jesus story.  Very valuable to understand the life, politics and environment of the Jesus story.  I highly recomend this to the devout and the secular.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|A story with a futuristic and bizarre setting is difficult for any author to master. At times the settings were imaginable and at other times - not so much. The idea of putting children as young as twelve into an arena with eighteen year olds was a bit too much to fathom.  The whole idea was bit repulsive. I liked Rau, Prim and the cat. Katniss was wishy-washy and not endearing to this reader.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very fun & challenging. It's for kids and adults. Fun trying to beat each other on this game. Very addicting!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was great! A must read, everyone can relate to a character in the story. Makes you feel throughout the whole book.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Jax develops as the season progresses. Enough characters in foundation to make a long and interesting story with depth, and no monotony.
1465408681|4.0|This book is pretty great if you are a star wars aficionado. My 8 year old loves it. Plays with it daily, and reads it to us. Now we are experts too!  ;) much information in this book. Four stars because I feel the price is a bit high, but the quality of the book is just fine.
B006DJ2JSI|2.0|I got this app to help with my spelling.  I'm dyslexic so it's hard for me to spell things correctly.  This app is only helpful if you already know how to spell the word, so what's the use of having it.<br />It's good if you need a definition, but for looking up the spelling of a word...it sucks.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|The connection to my Kindle is bad. I am sure this would work if the connection to the Kindle would work.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I like this app better than the one on my computer because it's easy to find the images even when they're turned around.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice layout and better radar detail then Weather Chan app, easily the best free weather app.  Using kindle fire hd
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I read Redbreast and Nemesis and was so hooked on Harry Hole (pronounced Hu-la) that I had to go back to the beginning and read the first.  I'm glad I did. It has the great twists and turns and descriptions of Australia that feel like they are from a native's perspective.  Loved the book - almost as much as Redbreast.  It will keep you guessing until the end.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|If you like marvel movies, you'll like this. Exciting and funny all at the same time. Can't wait for the sequel.
0307944093|3.0|I purchased this book on CDs because the reader is Anna Bentinck, and she was more than up to her excellent form.  I swear I could enjoy listening to her read the Yellow Pages.  She captures the characters beautifully and that adds much to the novel.  As to the novel itself, it is uneven.  It contains some beautifully written segments, the ending being a prime example.  But the youthful British society author David Nicholls portrays is dull, drugged, and too often dumb.  If you're searching for a great love story, you won't find it here.  But that may actually be the book's great strength.  Most of us don't live lives of great drama.  Most of us live lives like those of Nicholls's main characters.  What do we want and need from love?  What do we want and need from friendship?  Can we really love someone of the opposite sex who is also a best friend, or does mixing friendship and love lead to farce?  The book raises these questions, but there were times when only Anna Bentinck's artistry kept me listening.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have never done a Kindle review but this book was so great, that I had to. That was the most amazing war story ever. Loved it!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Star Trek into darkness was another hit in the Star Trek series. It was fast paced, with plot twist that kept you guessing till the end of the movie. The special effects were great as usual for a Star Trek film. I enjoyed the the use of earlier Star Trek plots and the swapping of characters such as Kirk dying in the dilithium chamber in stead of Spock. All in all the movie was one of the better Star Trek movies.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love legal and or crime shows. This one is awesome! This one really holds your interest. I highly reccomend!!!!!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Plenty of action. It didn't get that good of a rating when it was in theaters. I thought it was very good.<br />Two of my favorite actors are in it. Nice little sci do auction full. Would like to see a sexual or maybe<br />a prequel. With the entire cast...
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|sometimes I wonder why American TV even trys to redo a BBC version of a program. Of course Spacy was great but the script was weak in my opinion. Remember, Amazon asked for my opinion so if you don't agree...keep it to yourself. Don't write me back with your opinion. We all have one.
B00C5R8364|5.0|If you revere Forsyth, you were awaiting The Kill List. If you don't know him -- start reading!  You will cherish his every book! The Icon, Fist of God, the Classic: Day of the Jackal, is universally acclaimed. He IS the Master!
B00F1BFRA6|5.0|This is one of the greatest BBC programs and I've enjoyed it so much. Glad Foyel's War is back. The Brits just keep making great television
B0012CH350|4.0|Bought this by request for my Mom. She actually has an electric grill of the &#34;kettle&#34; type but she says it still fits good and appears well made. Her only change would be to make it a little longer so it covers the wheels, but I think if they did that it would be harder to roll around. She stores it in the garage so wind is not a problem. It is basically a cosmetic cover for her, so I can't comment on how well it stands up to weather.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love this series!  The characters are complex..sometimes likable, sometimes easy to hate...but always compelling. Great premise, great story line.  Is there a Season 3?  Bring it on!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Although not as scary as its predecessor, Doctor Sleep is every bit as captivating as one could hope from this master author.
B004UPANAI|5.0|Yes Hugh Jackman is hot. Knew that already. What I didn't know is WHY this series is sooo popular. Riveting tale of good and evil, family dysfunctionality, fantasy and intrigue. Plus...Jackman is still HOT!
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|We have movie night every Friday, so I've seen my share of terrible family movies.  I wasn't sure what to expect of this because I hadn't heard too much about it.  I thought this movie was great.  Funny for kids and adults alike, there were no cheesy parts, yet it captured the attention of my 3 and 8 year old, as well as myself!  Great animation and facial expressions.  Nicholas Cage is the perfect actor to play the idea-less cave man.  I just kept saying to myself, \\"That was a really good movie!\\".  So much so that I felt the need to give it a good review.  :)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Nice..I have this on my iPhone, nook and kindle. I love it! I love the kindle screen! I would recommend this to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was the most gory of the three for sure. It promises nothing happy but does leave one feeling complete, and hopefully as fictional as it is leaves the reader with the grave understanding of the responsibilities we have as to choose wisely so we in no lifetime parallel the story.
B009AMANBA|1.0|I had a feeling I wasn't going to like this movie, but after hearing about how great it was and seeing that it was nominated for  academy awards in several categories, I decided to take a chance and buy it. That was the wrong decision. I had to quit watching after an hour because it was so boring! It would have been so much better if they would have made the movie about Lincoln's whole life instead of focusing on the last 4 months of it. I can't comment on the whole movie because I only watched it for an hour but I see by reading other reviews that the whole movie is as boring as the part I saw. Maybe I'll try to watch the whole thing some day. As of now,  I don't understand how this movie got such rave reviews.
B00FEN000S|4.0|Great special effects,nice visuals,but the bonus features on the early digital release were not as good as i thought they would be,they had talked about going into the effects of the robots,but never did,and the robots are the star of the movie,they did though talk about the actors inside the head or cockpit of the robots but that was all,oh and some talk about the cast,maybe i was expecting blu-ray bought bonus features,and just got a taste of what is included on the actual discs.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|Easy read. Good way to get to know mark better. Would recommend this book to everyone wanting to start a business.
0345803485|4.0|It's a story of two people falling for each other even though they have never been in love before. One has serious issues and baggage and the other is very innocent. I loved this book. You really feel the connection between the two!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love dragonvale,but I wish their were more ways to get gems. You see, on Dragonvale the friends you have are on facebook. I don't like that. I wish that people that people that are not allowed on Facebook can get as much gems as the ones that are. I have proof for this too. One of my neighbors (friend) is on facebook and gets a lot more gems than me. I also wish there were more ways to get high dragons like sun dragons, rainbow dragons, gemstone dragons, treasure dragons and so on. I only have Kairos and the moon dragon(two of the most high dragons. Can kairos help me get the high dragons? Can Backflip studios make it that way on kairos? I cannot buy gems either. other than that it is a pretty good game. I don't like how many gems dragons cost or for how many gems breeding hints cost. Thank God for the breeding cave. other than that I like it. I want high dragons easier to get!
B003Y059EK|5.0|This movie was a little creepy for a kids movie but I loved it, and I am 35. This ais a movie my 12 year old would be into.
B00756GKBA|3.0|It's okay.  Every song sort of sounds like the one before it.  Not enough diversity on the CD for me.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|If you like hard but fun games granny Smith is the game for you when I get on my kindle fire first game I want to play granny Smith if you go to the tool shed it will say normal and hard if it is to hard press normal if is to easy press hard hope you like it!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Good book, haven't read Grisham in a few years.  Highly recommend this book.  Like quick and easy books to read.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I like the genre but the whole seatbelts thing irks me to no end ...I am looking forward to the third installment but I think I would not mind someone else behind it.<br /><br />Please note this is my second review as my first review received unique attention from a JJ Abrahms fan.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A truly beautiful love story. While predictable in overall story line I found the constant small twits in the plot kept me entranced from the first chapters. I loved Sky's mature outlook and \\"Geez, people. Really?\\" attitude towards her peers. I liked Holder's personality all the way thru, although I, admittedly, paused a bit at his seemingly erratic behavior at times. This was a wonderful story about two strong people that are even stronger together. This one is highly recommended.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Honestly, I do not like James Franco as an actor he isn't bad but his persona comes thru and what made this a great movie ...Mila Kunis I swear I would watch her over and over not because she is cute or popular but I believe now I know that story of the Wicked Witch better ( yet I am looking for some ruby slippers - did they purposely forget that? ) than her sister.<br />While Oz is neat this is a good story that is clumsly told<br />and part of Franco Ego shows RIGHT thru!<br />Frank Blume knows a lot of egos and wrote a great story
0064430227|5.0|When the book got here we sat down immediately and started to read. I have had to read it at least twice a day for the last week or so. To say that my son loves this book is an understatement!
B002WV5A9G|3.0|What is up with those phasers by the way ? and why don't they have communicators on their chest and honestly go over to HISHE to see the real ending its AWESOME<br />Nice reboot but I think I am going to stock up on eye care and carrots because the future me has such bad eyesight there are lights EVERYWHERE
0307165485|5.0|I had this book as a little girl. I used to love it. When I saw it on here I knew I had to get it for my little guy. As soon as it got here I flipped through the pages and remembered so many great bedtime stories that came from this book. We will be reading it tonight for sure!
B004ZN9RWK|1.0|This is a so-called &#34;RE-Mastered CD. Absolute JUNK! Sound quality is terrible and new out of the wrapper played 2/3 of two songs and started skipping. Never again do I buy other than original products. Never a problem with Amazon merchandise till this.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Well done but the storyline was very predictable... there is a zombie outbreak,, the big rush to find the cure they find the cure, humanity saved........
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|\\"Working on a Guru\\" alone, the rockabilly jam with George Harrison, would be reason enough to purchase this entire collection. for Dylan fans, this is yet another rewarding, gratifying edition of the official \\"Bootleg series\\" which are ALL worth purchasing. By today's standards, this is a huge moment. Its a Dylan album that ranks among his more surprising releases. There is high quality material throughout, some cover songs, some origininals, which stand the test of time very well. With the afterdubbed horns and garish overproduction removed, these songs take on a whole new identity. Grail Marcus writes revealing introduction to the booklet, contrasting his original review of Self Portrait. The \\"People's Hero\\" released an overproduced album which was poorly received and served to inspire some to remove Dylan from the pedestal upon which the adoring Radicals of the day had placed him. He escaped by releasing two s**** albums. Now we can see how great they might've been had he not allowed them to be neutered of overproduced afterdubs (by the record company?). This release ECLIPSES Self Portrait. Do Not BUY Self Portrait. Buy this instead!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James is a super author and I love his blog as well. I recommend this book to anyone looking to build confidence.
B00BWWS81S|1.0|Got this for my wife, who loved her after Black Horse and the Cherry Tree. This sounds like KT does Norah Jones. I was disappointed by the lack of energy in the music. We are seeing her live soon and I hope this album doesn't set the tone for the show!
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I really enjoyed it and it was full of great info.  I literally took notes - seriously!  Thank you Chris!
B009K916ZK|5.0|Worked perfect with my MacBook Pro Late 2011! No issues at all. I'm using this with my Yiynova MSP19U Drawing screen!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|An amazing example of a fictional microcosm reflecting the problems of our world both throughout history and today. I highly recommend the series for readers that liked Asimov 's Empire and Foundation trilogy, 1984 and Brave New World.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I can think of no better compliment for the movie than the fact that it raises the bar for the whole genre; it is an all-out scary movie that is beautifully shot and masterfully executed. It never underestimates the audience.<br />I believe that the great triumph of the movie is how much it invests in its characters - they are three-dimensional human beings with whom you can identify with (and in a horror movie, that is crucial!). The moment you put yourself in their shoes is the moment the movie wins you over. By the end of the movie, I was in pains over what was happening BECAUSE I cared about whom it was happening to.<br />So yes - this is one of the best horror movies to grace the big screen in recent years, and it makes me proud to be a horror enthusiast.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was grate . A little watered down compared to the first two books of this trilogy but still good. I loved the chapter in Christian s POV .wish Mrs. James would write the whole trilogy in his POV
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining was the first Steven King book I read, I liked the movie, and as we all know the books are always better..I found it to be amazing and have been reading Steve King since.  I was completely surprised to find out this was a continuation of The Shining, and God help me I thought my author had lost it, I mean how can you add to a book like that?  I was wrong to ever doubt him, the book was excellent!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Even if you aren't a fan of the &#34;Alien&#34; series, this is a great movie.  Buy it and watch it.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|The good Lord intended for Denzel Washington to be an actor. He could not be more talented. There is no actor that could ever take his place. This movie starts out a little slow and then, bam, moves right into action that you ride along with, wondering what is going to happen next. Very exciting. Ryan Reynolds shows a different side of him that you normally don't see in other movies he has made. He did a fine job as well. Enjoyed it! I think that they made this movie just for me.<br />  Clay
B00E9P959O|3.0|actually on my tube amp and HiFi setup I like the original version better.Neils drums on the remix are flat sounding and in the back to far.to much echo.the remix does have some good things about it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|YouTube is a wonderful media for learning. I've learned so many things mainly about sewing and crafts. Everything anyone ever wanted to learn is on this site. Love it! One of the best sites ever invented!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Never have I read a book that is so touching without being cheesy and sentimental. The characters are smart and flawed and real. They may be dying, but they live right off the page.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game was entertaining but not very difficult.  It would be better if it were more like the room with more thinking and interaction involved.  I still enjoyed it.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|The hardest part is the ending...there is still more I want to read about in this series. What happens to Hana, to Julian and Coral, not to mention Alex and Lena. It really is a book you can't put down. I can only hope there will be another book in this series.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Just finished the last page of &#34;Orphan Train&#34; on my iPad (kindle app),and for the first time realized that I had not seen the end of a book coming. I thought I was only part way through a wonderful story! Flipped the iPad to start the next chapter,with tears in my eyes,and to my dismay no more beautiful writing to enjoy. Thank-you Christina Baker Kline for this heart wrenching story of survival.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Really fun book to read, especially if you like the TV show &#34;Castle&#34;.  Yet, the show not withstanding, the book is fun to read.  I am hooked by the series.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|i love costume dramas especially English ones.  They are a gentle reminder of how life was back in the day and how people lived life and loved and had fun while doing it.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Enjoyable. Just a bit short on phases. Needs more scenes. Too quickly are you at the end of the game plus having to like it on FB or submit a review in order to unlock bonus is ridiculous.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I didn't realize how much I depend on my Kindle till the micro adapter broke off. I ordered this replacement cord yesterday at noon and it was in my mailbox this afternoon. Works as expected and that's all anyone could want
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This story surprised me in several places.  The basic connection between the women in the story was easy to see about a third of the way in, but the way the characters were going to respond to their situations was not.  I enjoyed the fact that I couldn't always tell what would happen next.
B00B8XC2O0|5.0|I have been a fan of J J Cale since I first heard him in the early seventy's and listened to him on my vinyl recordings often.  When I heard of his untimely death I decided to replace my vinyl with CD and these have done the job.  I am enjoying sharing these with my young bride who had not heard him before I shared him with her.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google has never failed me in my searches or product finds.  Easy for this older lady.  I use google for 90 percent of my searches.
B00BSTVEDE|3.0|Dear Blade Runner fans!<br />I am a huge fan and i was really happy when i received this piece of really great quality gate fold cover and superb 180gram pure virgin vinyl record....but to be honest,in my 35 years of collecting records there is no way and i mean no way to put almost 60 minutes of great sound on vinyl without any side effects.the sound is amazing but not on all tracks.<br />Forgive me if i am wrong but on 'love theme','Memories of Green' and 'blade runner blues' there are some surface noise and dynamics lacks.What's wrong with two records?Why didn't they press it on two vinyl?Take a look around.All serious audiophile record maker put max 18 minutes per side and 20 minutes per side is still good but 22 minutes may cause issues depending upon the music, anything over 22 minutes is a problem if we are talking about serious audiophile pressing.if you asking me...this one is only a filler.a nice blade runner souvenir.<br />sadly but true.<br />kind regards!<br /><br />Tony Knezovic
B000I5SY5U|5.0|After seeing a recent production of &#34;Cabaret&#34; at a local theatre, I wanted to watch the movie again. It's a superb rendition - love Fosse's choreography, and Liza Minelli and Joel Gray were at the peak of their performance abilities when they made it. It's a dark, dark, tale but so well done.
B00C5R8364|5.0|It was a good book from the beginning until the end !<br />I was sorry when I finished the book.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|However sad the premise was, this series kept you always at the edge of your seat wondering who done it
B00422LESO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book until the last 15% or so.<br />I really loved the premise, the humor is great, the writing is wonderful (which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 3)<br /><br />The end felt rushed and unsatisfying. It was like suddenly, magically, everything worked out in two paragraphs and then it ended.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|this season opener is intriguing and josh whedon wshowes that he is still a master of scifi action series even after firefly
B000CDIOYO|5.0|Matthew's Passion is a monument in itself  -  this recording reaches the summits !<br /><br />The uncluttered setting, the camera work pointing out every singer's face ... and , gliding over that , the great Karl Richter , deeply inspired , who succeeds mixing precise (almost military ...) conductor attitude with gentle, smooth hand gestures and expression .<br /><br />Powerfully beautiful , and bringing tears to the eyes ...
B0048KXRR6|5.0|THIS IS A MOVIE THAT ANYONE OF ANY AGE WILL ENJOY!!!  IF'S TOUCHING AND FUNNY AND EXCITING!!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!
B008B1BL4E|5.0|I think that it gives a new and very extensive view of those years and was for me sort of an eye-opener.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Although the actors were not totally outstanding in any role, the cinematography was absolutely awesome!<br /><br />Now, that is not to take away from the actors themselves. But the atmosphere. Hell, I believed that diesel engines could power a robot as big as a sky scraper. Not really a robot though. More of a giant cyborg where man and machine become one. And the aliens are awesome!! No hoaky monsters here, no sir, as soon as a fake foot would land another would come crashing down with deadly purpose.<br /><br />No spoilers here, but taken as a whole, hell I didn't get up for the whole 2.5 hours of it. I rarely write interview, so sorry if I didn't cover it all, but I definitely don't want to ruin your experience. Here's hoping you have a great time too!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best app ever and it is totally cool. the best games ever are on this app boo yah
B003G4W49C|5.0|The very best sci-fi ever! I have this book over and over and I can never put it down once I start..
B001P829VY|5.0|Bogart is at his best when he's a little over the edge. This movie is an obvious classic and speaks to his acting range and a fine drama for the time it was produced.
B00ECLU346|1.0|Nothing close to previous 2 films. Felt like a boring chase film rather than a comedy. Worried that there will be another episode
B00D7JGL36|5.0|THE CD HAS SOME GREAT CLASSIC GET DOWN COUNTRY CRY IN YOU'RE BEER STUFF. VINCE DOES A GREAT JOB ON THE VOCALS & IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING PAUL FRANKLIN ON PEDAL STEEL IS A WINNER. THE ONLY DOWN SIDE TO THE WHOLE THING WOULD BE THE STUDIO OVER PROSSED THE STEEL PARTS. FRANKLIN IS GOOD ENOUGH A STEEL PLAYER THEY DID NOT HAVE TO PUT IN SO MUCH REVERB. THATS  JUST MY OPINION. I BET ITS PAULS TOO.
0345511468|5.0|I read the first two Making of Star Wars books by J.W. Rinzler within months of their being published. Both were engrossing works of art containing many rarely-seen photos and anecdotes from cast and crew from Star Wars.<br /><br />Just like the first two books, this book gave so much detail and life to what used to be my favorite movie of the original trilogy, and made me want to watch the entire original trilogy again. Everything from set design to sound design and the soundtrack is explored and related in incredible detail, from pre-production to post-release.<br /><br />Unlike most other 'coffee table' books of similar girth, these books will have any serious Star Wars fan devouring every word, cover-to-cover--you can't repel a book of this magnitude!<br /><br />There are only two complaints I have about this book:<br /><br />1. The text is very small, and the pages are glossy--meaning it can be slightly difficult to read in some light.<br />2. It's the last Making of Star Wars book for the original trilogy. Somehow I don't think reading about Jar-Jar's floppy ears will ever be as enthralling as reading about the countless hours Anthony Daniels and Peter Mayhew spent in their iconic costumes.<br /><br />If you love Star Wars, this book is worth every penny.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|An all-time classic.  I never tire of watching this film which is timeless - one of my favourites.  The dancing is superb; Donald O'Connor gives the best performance of his career.  I recommend it most highly.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|after the last upgrade I am no longer able to collect my mail from my friends it just kicks me out of the game
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|First off, im a HUGE fan of both the original Evil Dead movies & Bruce Campbell. That being said, i went into this one with caution & came out really surprised. It seems like a sort of remake/modern sequel type of movie as it bring some new things to the table but also keeps some very familiar elements and in some cases even hints that the thingss in the older Evil Dead movies have already happened (i dont wanna spoil it but those who've seen both will know what i mean). Also, stick around after the credits for a special bonus scene with Bruce Campbell :). I thought the cast did a good job, the story was very good and the gore effects are also very well done with no CG being used almost at all. I know most remakes suck but this is one of the better ones and more then worth a watch for fans of horror & fans of the original series. I know they plan to do a sequal to this, then do Army of Darkness 2 & finally a movies to bring both Ash & Mia's stories together and i for one cant wait.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A novel idea that everyone should try at least once. I like the idea of practical spirituality and these lessons force the reader to examine how the universe really works.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Can't wait for the next one. I can see where Jennifer is an outstanding actress! Put any of her films on your &#34;must see&#34; list.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I was trying to download this game to my kindle fire but for some reason it wouldn't so I downloaded it to my phone instead.  The game plays well but it too small to enjoy.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I was enjoying the game then it said updates needed and it erased all i had worked for and i was level 25 or higher now back to level 6 by playing it over.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love it a lot more since it upgraded. It was clutching but have no problem now. Very fun game. Would recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's so much fun. I never thought I would like it but I do sometimes I don't understand it but it's still a lot of fun
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I think its really good and funny. I play it when i need a laugh or just feel like it. It is VERY additive. And best of all...<br />ITS FREE!
B006RXQASA|4.0|Everything in it was funny and funny and funny !<br />Would be even more funny to watch with couple of friends around.
B0094LU2TU|5.0|Its hard to describe why I like this movie so much, I just do.<br />It's unique, looks good and, just feels like it has heart throughout the production.<br />Great modern sci-fi.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Miss leading I thought it can with music but it didn't.. Could not find instruction  for  use of this product.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|As a newbie to home 3D, I find this dvd great to showcase.  As an old Laserdisc guy, I now cringe at spending over $15 bucks for any video medium.  But if you just need one, hard to argue with Avengers.
B0000027RL|5.0|I love almost every song on Ten. It's one of those albums I could play for hours and not get tired of it.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|If you like movies like Braveheart, Troy, 300, and HBO Rome, then this series is for you, you will love it.
B000003TA4|1.0|Why ruin art in this fashion? This entire album sucks now, because the entire album is basically brickwalled. Look up Loudness wars and you will understand. Watch this too. [...]
B0060D3BWK|5.0|Childhood classic, I love watching every year no matter how old I am. It's still exciting every time and fun to watch with family and friends.
B00E7SXPVW|4.0|I really like the 20th anniversary album. I like all the B sides and remixes and demos. I kind of just wish that I could actually tell a difference between some of the songs and their remixes.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Volume 2 had a coupled of twists.  Enjoyed the story.  At least this book I think they could make a movie out of.  Volume one would have to be x rated.  Young love prevails.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have read almost all of kings books. This one will most defiantly remain in my top five. Suspense, horror, and curiosity, combined with real life compassion and fulfillment. Danny is not the same little boy you grew to love in the shining...
0345803485|1.0|Much ado about nothing.... Honestly, the hype that surrounded this book was so well conceived.  It rode the crest of popularity hooking a lot of readers.  It didn't deserve the &#34;best&#34; of anything.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|A great series for the Downton Abbey fans! Do not pass it up - can't wait to watch the rest of the series.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|I've been using pFolio (formerly Picfolio) for about a year now and I highly recommend it.  It is an excellent app for uploading/downloading/organizing pictures between your various devices and your Picasa Web Albums account.  The interface is very straightforward and easy to use.

B00AZMFK3K|2.0|\\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" is the sequel to JJ Abrams awful 2009 revision of the hoary sci-fi series.  Though the weaknesses of the first film remain, there are enough redemptive features here to bear watching.<br /><br />  Though the choices for the Kirk and Spock leads remain poor - Chris Pine is a clown, Zachary Quinto is unlikable and unbelievable as an intellectual and the Spock/Uhura neurotic romance angle remains  - new additions to the cast improve things quite a bit: Benedict Cumberbatch - fresh from his popular portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in an equally crass bastardization of that genre - and ol' Robocop Peter Weller add a great deal of gravitas to the sequel.  Cumberbatch has a grand time twisting his narrow features into all kinds of sinister contortions, using his resonant British voice powerfully.  No attempt is made to explain why the Indian Khan Noonian Singh is now a pasty faced Brit.  Weller is a wonder, giving his militaristic Starfleet admiral the perfect air of menacing arrogance.<br /><br />  One amusing manufactured controversy involves a glimpse of young Carol Marcus in her underwear.  The self-righteous were \\"shocked, shocked\\" that Hollywood would dare to show an attractive woman in flimsy clothing.  The screenwriter even issued a \\"mea culpa\\" to the easily offended.  No one admitted that this has been going on - usually in longer shots - since moving pictures began.<br /><br />  The second Abrams trek continues to boast production values denied the franchise during the years when it was well-written.  Viewers can ooh and ahh over a giant black Federation starship that menaces the Enterprise.  Interior sets have been upgraded since the last film too.  Though they remain pink and white with annoying lens flares, the sets include scenes shot at Lawrence Livermore Labs.  This marginally mitigates the mistake of shooting a Budweiser distillery as Engineering.<br /><br />  The biggest problem remains the script.  Whereas in Abrams' \\"Star Trek\\" the main characters repeated their old signature lines ad infinitem (\\"I'm a doctor, not a ____\\"), the sequel repeats variations on entire scenes from popular predecessors.  The cynicism of that recycling effort is all too evident.  Abrams even repeats himself; if the Enterprise rises above a cloud layer in his first film, why not a second?  The vessel also pulls extra duty as a part-time submarine (!) here.<br /><br />  Now that the sequel has made far more money than its worthier predecessors, its director can go on to ruining Star Wars.  Baz Luhrman anyone?e main characters repeated their old signature lines ad infinitem (\\"I'm a doctor, not a ____\\"), the sequel repeats variations on entire scenes from popular predecessors.

B003M70O5O|5.0|Did not care for it when it first launched. Recently watched the pilot on got hooked.. I'm on season 5 now..
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show! It's well written with smart and funny characters. Definitely a good choice for anyone who know the life of a lawyer. Also, great quality streaming.
B00DNDR29I|1.0|This style of black rap music is an acquired taste that doesn't appeal to me so I gave it away to the deskclerk at my gym.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have waited and waited and waited for this final book. It did not disappoint me!!!!! If anyone out there that has not read the Wheel of Time series of books, I feel sorry that you have missed out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks! I love it! Playing with your friends is so cool.it's a timekiller but also super fun. I just can't wait till realms comes out. There's gonna be hunger games servers! The pc is also really fun if u like this then get it on the computer too. It's worth the money, even if it seems pricey.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This was for my husband for his birthday, he hasn't watch it yet but he loves the movie. Hopefully the picture quality is what we expec ted ...I will keep you posted.
B000FC13MM|4.0|I read this trilogy years ago and really liked it.  The main character is a young girl with intelligence and courage before vampires and archers were popular.  I like the magic and fantasy.  If a sequel were written, I'd read it readily.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We have used ours for more than 2 weeks now...  We love it so much, that we bought another one.
B005LAII4E|3.0|Was a bit disappointed in this sequel. It could've been a much better movie than it turned out to be. Not happy that Duke was killed off (I think). Should there be a third, I hope they do a job equal to the first movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|I learned of this game at my niece's 7th birthday. She had already completed it and was asking for the 12+ version. I purchased it for my seven-year old son and he is having a lot of fun playing the game, all while learning the patterns for simplifying and solving algebraic formulas using silly animal pictures, dice, and eventually letter variables.
B00003CXA2|1.0|I have this and when I went to watch 'the movie' I found this was only the making of the movie, but not the movie itself.  Disappointed.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I bought this as my boyfriend and I had been talking about it and remembering it.  It is one of the few animated movies he can stand and we watched it together.  We both love it even now!
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|The 20/20 Experience 2<br /><br />Justin Timberlake has once again impressed me with the second half and conclusion of \\"The 20/20 Experience\\". From my last review, I was expecting this album to not only have the sound from the first half but influences from \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\" and \\"Justified\\". Fortunately, he had not only revived the influences but introduced new sounds into his songs which surprised me. In an article, Justin had said this half will be mostly be about the reality of a relationship. He definitely kept his word. I received my copy of the album the day after its release date and listened to it. Today, some of the songs kept playing in my head. However, the two songs that constantly replayed in my head was \\"Only When I Walk Away\\" and \\"Drink You Away\\".<br /><br />Justin has put a lot of work onto this album and I can cite it immediately. Before this album was released, fans streamed the album for free the week before on iTunes and began giving it positive reviews. I was pleased to see fans already loving the songs or the entire album. Most fans that weren't satisfied with the first half should be pleased with this half since it is completely different in sound. I can easily assume that Justin doesn't want to do an album that sounds exactly the same. Every artist in the music industry basically wants to bring a fresh new sound to their albums. I'm a guy and I love the second half and find every song interesting, relatable, and addicting. In my opinion, this half concludes perfectly to the already bestselling \\"The 20/20 Experience\\" sequel.<br /><br />Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want): This song makes a perfect entrance into the album and reminds fans that Justin hasn't lost his \\"sexyback\\". Justin and Timbaland make this song into an instant highlight. I love hearing the beginning of the song and the beat it brings. This makes me want to dance and move along to the beat. It also reminds me of \\"FutureSex/LoveSound\\" partially because of the somewhat-similarbeat the songs have. I think Justin brought a little FS/LS influence into this song.<br /><br />True Blood: I absolutely love this song and definitely has a FS/LS influence. Before hearing this song, fans called this song \\"Thriller 2013\\" or a Halloween themed song. When I first heard it, I ultimately agreed with the fans' responses. However, it reminds me of LoveStoned with the similar beats and vocal ranges in the lyrics. Ultimate highlight of the album. No questions asked.<br /><br />Cabaret: Justin and Drake make this song a hit and is a must listen for JT and Drake fans. Drake's rap verses make this song even better for his fans to listen. I don't have much to say about the song than say it's diverse in sound and doesn't have any influence but nevertheless it's a good song.<br /><br />TKO: The second single off the album and the best song on the album and as well a highlight. When I first heard this song, it reminded of Chop Me Up a lot with the sound and beat. I even played the two songs simultaneously and I found a similarity between the two. Surely, fans instantly became in love with the song and prefer this song than the first single from the second half. It again has a FS/LS influence along with a Justified influence combined.<br /><br />Take Back the Night: The first single off the album. I constantly kept playing this song and it became again one of my favorites. I also enjoyed the music video weeks after the single was released. Partially, fans were pleased or unsatisfied with the song. I don't see a problem with the song and I will continue to enjoy the song regardless of critical reviews. Justin shows in this song that he's not falling into the bad music area and experiments with a Michael Jackson sound which in my opinion interests me a whole lot.<br /><br />Murder: Justin and Jay Z team up again on this song after \\"Suit & Tie\\" and \\"Holy Grail\\". I mostly love the verses Justin sings and keeps the song at a steady beat. I respect Jay Z a lot and he has good rapping verses in his songs but some I just can't cope with. My only concern was that was it really necessary to diss Yoko Ono. I wish Jay Z came up with a similar type of rap verse like he did on \\"Suit & Tie\\" without dissing anybody. Overall, the song has an awesome beat and sound.<br /><br />Drink You Away: Honestly, I was instantly addicted to this song and surprised to hear the sound the song brought. I had to repeat the song to hear what I'm actually hearing. I love the country and blues sound Justin brings and how he traces back to his Memphis roots. In my opinion, this is an ultimate highlight off the album and brings a new sound no JT fan has never heard before. I thought this song would be a sad sing but Justin enlightened it which makes this song even better. Best song off the album.<br /><br />You Got It On: I love listening to this song and reminds me of \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\". In my opinion, this song could easily fit into the first half. This song brings a relaxed tone throughout the entire song.<br /><br />Amnesia: Many fans and I can easily call this a \\"Cry Me A River\\" part 2. This is another highlight and basically shows heartbreak. Justin shows his influence from Justified into this song. I personally recommend this song to anyone who wants to hear a follow-up from \\"Cry Me A River\\". Although the two songs don't exactly sound the same, they both share the same theme: heartbreak. Justin demonstrates his raw emotions near the end of the song, which in my opinion makes the song even better to listen and relate to.<br /><br />Only When I Walk Away: The absolute best song off the album! This song reminds me of \\"Holy Grail\\", due to the tone of his voice nearly matching the verses from the song itself. Justin ultimately shows his aggressiveness and anger into this song with a rock-infused and reggae influenced sound. It's almost if Justin is telling me that he is mad at somebody and attempts to seek revenge. The title says it all, a love broken apart by lies. This is one of Justin's best songs he's ever made. I'm glad he wrote this song and I again have the connection through his lyrics and the tone he brings. Thank you Justin for adding this song onto this album and showing all you got!<br /><br />Not a Bad Thing/Pair of Wings: I love the intro of \\"Not A Bad Thing\\", which notably introduces a new sound. Also, it's a love song brutally honest but shares the gentleness with guitar sounds. I personally think this is a highlight off the album and it's a feel-good song. \\"Pair of Wings\\" is a hidden but personal song which everyone can relate to and shows Justin's raw talent. The lyrics describes about a strong relationship that conquer all the obstacles surrounding them. This song shows the real side of Justin and who he is and how he wants love in his life. Perfect ending to the last song off the album.<br /><br />Blindness: This is a Target exclusive bonus track. It's a feel-good song and a excellent addition to the album. I again don't have a lot to say about this song than say it's an awesome track and well crafted.<br /><br />Electric Lady: Another Target exclusive bonus track which again is an excellent and good-beat song addition.<br /><br />For all of you who aren't satisfied with the two albums released this year should at least show support for Justin since he hasn't been in the music industry for seven years. Also, at least be glad that Justin hasn't been influenced by the bad music out there. This album is basically a combination of FutureSex/LoveSounds and Justified. I'm glad that I bought the 20/20 sequel and hopefully us fans don't have to wait another six to seven years to hear his fifth studio album. Justin is a musical genius and really makes a song into a instant highlight. I give this album a 10 and has brought exactly what I wanted along with new sounds that I've started to grown into. This year has been big for JT and music has changed after he released his second album. People, before you purchase this album, listen to the snippets and ignore the critics' reviews on this album. They don't know what real music is and oddly prefer bad music. I guess critics forget that an artist changes their sound in every album they release. Justin and Timbaland, keep doing what you're doing and ignore the critical reception critics bring. This and the first half is perfect and thank you for staying true musically and as a person.
B00DNO3HXC|5.0|Fine period film.  The acting is very good as is the story.  A great mix of emotions are protrayed and the music is haunting.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus and his co-author made a tragic event a deeply moving book. I've heard Marcus Luttrell talk about his survival, and his recovery, but this book took the details to another level. I appreciated the chance to learn more about the situation in the war, and how our SpecOps guys get trained. There was a good balance between detail and discretion. I would recommend this book to anyone over age 16 or so. In particular, this could be a very special book for those who love the military, or have family serving, and people who don't agree with OIF/OEF who might want to get a different perspective on the war on terror from someone with absolute credibility. The storytelling is a bit rough, on purpose, I believe, and preserves Luttrell's &#34;voice.&#34; Readers looking for a polished and precise &#34;storyline,&#34; clinical foreign policy analysis or politically correct opinions would not find those things in this book. On a personal level, it was hard to read at times because it contains a lot of grief and pain. However, it inspired me to see how Marcus came out on the other side of absolute hell on earth--and it reminds me to keep up my own fight.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|I had to watch this movie to compare to the current release.  You just can't replace Mia Farrow and Robert Redford.  I liked the new version in 3D and the cinematography was really great in the newer version.  You just can't compare to the original, I just see Robert Redford as Gatsby.
B00DMEQP46|5.0|I anxiously awaited this album as much as I awaited GTA 5's release that same Tuesday. While I'll openly admit that songs like 'Kids' got me hooked on them, I love that they've grown up so much. I know a lot of fans want more pop music from them, but I don't think that's ever going to happen.<br /><br />It took me about a 3rd listen to fully appreciate this album. There are a lot of things about it that remind me of Pink Floyd's album, 'The Wall' (Besides the sound effects, duh). I'm not saying it rips it off or that they're influenced by Pink Floyd (Are they?), but songs like 'Cool Song No. 2' and \\"I love you too, Death\\" gave me that strong vibe. It's an album that will be difficult to \\"digest\\" on the 1st listen, but give it a few listens, loosen up, and let the music take you away. B]<br /><br /> Music is an art and no two \\"paintings\\" are ever the same. Also remember, just 'cause YOU don't like it, doesn't mean it's not any good.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|This was a great family movie, all can enjoy this one.  I like the 3D effects in this one also, just enough out into the room to make it real, not too much.  It was a cute story also.
B00005N6KG|2.0|this headphone was junk - I use headphones for running every day and I found these ones to be crummy.  they worked okay for sound, but the ear pieces don't fit into my ears and the part that goes around your head is not very adjustable.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  I had to return the blue ray because Universal has had a block problem with it's Blu-ray movies.  You can't play them.  I don't know what the problem is in production, this has happened with a few of the movies I bought.  The DVD plays but the Blue-ray doesn't? I have gone so far as playing on several players, updating, and even renting them.  The problem is in the block put in the Blue ray disc.  Too bad, I wanted the movie in blue ray, had to settle for watching it in DVD instead and buying that one.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Everything by Nicholas Sparks gets five stars from me! this book is no exception. The movie was great but the books are always better.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|I again wanted this because it's a Christmas Classic.  The Blue Ray makes it long lasting and very clear.  This is a must have for your Christmas collection
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The Jobs book is fascinating.  Reportorial rather than artistic, but it provides a true picture of a genius who has wrestled the world in his direction.  His last statement is wonderful and touching, and at the end, I cried for him and for our loss of him .
B00DHRLK84|4.0|I like Brad Pitt, this wasn't &#34;Walking Dead&#34;, but I enjoyed the movie.  The Zombies were a different take, with their speed, lots of action and you get to look at Brad.
B003Y5H5C4|5.0|love this movie!! cute nerdy romance turns into a crazy race of a scavenger hunt to stop the bomb from blowing up! totally fresh twist and ideas! not your run of the mill comedy.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|I got this in Blue Ray for the longevity and the quality.  I love Blue Ray, it's very durable and the high definition works good when it's from an old film movie, they seem to be able to make it so crisp and new.  A must have Christmas Classic Movie.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I enjoyed playing the first Angry Birds. It is a fun twist with the Star Wars My kids love it too
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Glitchy and difficult to use, also the add at the bottom of my screen was an inch high. I removed it and added the Facebook app for kindle fire, it was free and works great so far.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Easy to use, but it would be nice for removed items to be permanently removed from the library and not able to be viewed after they're deleted.
B00E7SFAAG|3.0|Its fun, but hard. I think the first few levels should explain things more so you can get the hang of it.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|FIRST week I had this I would have given this APP a five star, but now the APP keeps locking upon me. Very disappointed in this app. Was great while it worked.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|WWII spy thriller that even though we well know the outcome, keeps the reader on the edge of the seat.  Un-put-downable.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|All I can say...how long must I wait for the next book? Martin keeps the plot so twisted it will be great fun to experience the way it unravels.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everyone should watch this. Love it! You fall in love w/ the whole family and household. Can't wait to watch more.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|For the price its ok, but it doesnt offer anything new for streaming media yet. It allows you to stream youtube and netflix from your phone, but many other devices can stream both of those. The screencast feature is almost unusable, which was the only value add this thing offers. When you cast a chrome tab from your pc, there is a 2 sec lag, and if trying to watch video in a browser, its choppy and frequently drops the connection. Ill continue to use an hdmi cable instead.<br /><br />The youtube sharing can be convenient if you want to take a vid you're watching on your phone and throw it up on the tv, but I dont do that much. Also, if you have google play movies, you can stream them well. Thats prob the biggest plus, but thats assuming you buy any movies from the google play store.<br /><br />Overall, ive had it for a month and never really use it. My roku remains my streaming device of choice.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this book in 3 days. It kept my attention and the plot was good. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B004VD3YIM|3.0|If you want the current updates purchase the app in the play store.  Otherwise best web cam app for foscam.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app very easy to use . I always use it in church instead of carrying a bible around
0670026557|5.0|How being nice to people is waaaaaayyy more effective than being that &#34;guy&#34;  Take a breath and look in the mirror - this book is great!
B0013F1D02|5.0|I've seen it lots of times, and it never gets old. Enchanting from beginning to end. You won't regret it!
B007JPNIHQ|3.0|Very interesting book with good info ,I like it ,with draws no pictures but  well explained  if you read carefully you will find  useful
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Back in 1989 when I worked at the Director's Guild in Hollywood, I walked into the lounge one day and several directors were sitting around discussing what film deserved an Academy award.  They asked me my choice, and I told them I'd vote for Die Hard (The original).  They were not impressed.  Nevertheless, any fan of action films would have enjoyed my choice far more than the films they were discussing.<br /><br />The Die Hard series is the only film mentioned that day that is still around after all these years.  A Good Day to Die Hard is a first-rate action film because of the action, the humor, and the characters.<br /><br />The action is full throttle from beginning to end.  Plus, the scenes are fresh.  Willis and Courtney both did a great job.  The humor was subtle, which is what made it good.  Willis had many good lines related to his dysfunctional relationship with his son.  Good dialogue.  Finally, the characters were winners.  Willis' character was almost as good as the original.  Jai Courtney (who played the bitter son) did a great job.  Yuliya Snigir impressed me as well.  She had few lines, but turned out to be a competent villain.  If you like action and humor, I recommend A Good Day to Die Hard. --Roger Weston, author of [[ASIN:B007DQ4B6I The Recruiter: A Thriller]]
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Very motivational. Darren used basic behavioral principles to help you identify core values, goals, areas of strength & improvement; and then gives tools to help you fine tune goals & what to focus on to make the biggest impact in your life. I also love the premise of helping others to succeed in order to help yourself be successful.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is so much fun. I get sucked in and am determined to figure out what I need to do. Love it!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Not for me. I hated wife after reading 1st chapter and wished she was dead. I'll probably be the only one who didn't like this book and I'm ok with that.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The characters and plot development are top notch.  I enjoy the way characters look each other in the eye and won't back down....  Donna RULES!
030726999X|5.0|If I see a movie that's intrigues me and the book is the reason then I want to read the movie first. I am thankful to have done this because the movie would have been a little difficult to keep up with. The movies are never quite as good as the book though, but I did enjoy the movie also.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's rly not bad but needs to add these ( in this order I want them most ).<br />1.Skins<br />2.Redstone torches in creative mode and the game.<br />3.Make a random button on the realms where you join servers already made.<br />  Other than that it's amazingly cool and the way you work is also good and this is the longesttttttttttttttttt review I've ever done so yay me!!!!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I had heard of the TED Talks before but didn't realize they were as inspiring as they are. This is a great platform for people with big ideas to share what they have learned with the rest of the world. They have great intensity and passion for the subject they are speaking about and it gives me, and others I'm sure,  motivation to voice the things that inspire us also.  LOVE IT!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The numerous twist and turns kept me riveted to my seat.  Terrific imagination at work ......producing great reading for all ages!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Like it a lot. There are different challenges. Interesting games, great graphics, lots of fun to share with friends and family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|good stuff.  lots of levels and missions to keep you interested.  fun for my six year old in the car.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This game is awesome...except for the plane game and moose if you have a kindle device but I only know how to get rid of the plane game...just go to settings at the main menu and disable it..Hope this helps
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My son loves Legos and Minecraft so this was a no brainier for his birthday. He loves the set I got him but I feel like I got ripped off. These are not full size Legos, these are the tiniest Lego pieces. The figures do not move and they are 1/4 the size of normal Lego figures. It's an ok set, but buyer beware. If I had it to do over I would maybe pick up another Ninjago or Marvel set.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Read them all<br />Already cant wait for the next one....if there is one<br />Always interesting<br />Always in put downable<br />Always leave you waiting for more
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is the best game ever. I would recommend it to others. It is a game that little kids can play and not worry about it.
B00E34A9FU|4.0|I ordered the deluxe set (3xCD + DVD), received it soon enough, and was about halfway through this terrific sounding legendary show when I realized it was supposed to include a 40-page booklet. I tried to respond to the seller but unfortunately (this time) it was sent by Amazon and I was unable to provide feedback. I did not want to go through the hassle of repackaging and returning the set, and waiting who knows how long for a new package. Anyone else get shorted?
B0064MGU98|5.0|Good for serious attire audience who love to linger. For hours of binging on delish storyline s and word class actors and writing.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I really like the ability to filter for event groups.  I use it mainly for exercise, cooking, and short reminder periods (like naps).
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Very fun. Very addicting. But also very un-kid friendly. This can be changed in the options menu with a for symbol code. Something easy for you to remember. I turned out on and has to uninstall and reinstall because I forgot my Passover. So beware.
B00CWGLOY6|1.0|I bought this as an electronic Kindle book and expected to be able to read the comic in the same way that eg. the DC or Marvel Comic read apps would let me read a Marvel comic. However, Kindle has not implemented any of the gestures and zooms that are required to read a comic. So from Saga the speech bubbles and text boxes stay too small and unreadable. I ended up with an electronic book that I cannot read because of technology matters.
B00ENTDDGW|1.0|me and my friend were hoping to be able to play this together, but it doesn't have a multiplayer option, only playing with a computer. and we found this our right after we'd gotten the full version. don't waste your time!!!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great book about and inventor is often passed over for more famous names.  A lot of interesting facts about how was integral in many inventions.  I have become a Tesla fan because of this book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is a totally cool game and I play it everyday,my cousin Carolyn got me hooked on it and I play hours and hours or at least until I get tired.I also gave it a five star rating.
B0042ESTQW|4.0|This silicone cover is one of several I purchased.  They offer great protection, with great looks.  Easy to put on and take off.  Access holes in bottom allow you to access charger and SD card ports.  Highly recommend.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I am quite pleased with this movie.  I have always loved the Alien series so when I saw it online for such a great price I bought it.  I didn't have any trouble with the sound or captions and the picture is clear.  Included in the set is an special edition/director's cut of each movie along with a featurette disc and a documentary disc.  There are nine discs in all and I have never seen anything like this in the stores especially not at this price.  If you love the Alien movies get this quadrilogy for your movie collection.
B00ENV1HPY|5.0|I didn't realize how much I had missed Mazzy Star until their new album came out.  I had listened to them waaay back in the nineties (I was in college) and then they kind of...vanished.  I assumed they had just gone the way of so many other bands from the mid-nineties and just faded away.  When I heard they were releasing a new album, I was kind of excited.  All those memories of their music came back.  I told my 17 year old daughter about them, and she gave them a listen and kind of went \\"meh\\" on them (she wasn't around much in the nineties, anyway.)  I didn't care.  When I got the new album downloaded, it was amazing.  I like the updated sound with the variation of the instruments (the slide guitar, the drums, etc.)  It took me back to those hazy college days (pre-internet, too!)  I think this is their best album to date.  It has been on repeat continuously in the background of my house since purchase.  Highlights on the album (for me least) are \\"Spoon\\" with its twangy guitar jingle, and the title track, which is amazing.  If you are a fan of Mazzy Star, you shouldn't be disappointed.  Put on a pair of quality headphones, sit in a darkened room, and let yourself drift away.
B0089LOG02|5.0|There are some books that you wish would go on forever... No matter where the author chooses to end the story it is too soon for you  You are just so enthralled with the characters - their past and their future - that you can't help but want more.  Christina Baker-Kline's novel, Orphan Train is one of these books....<br /><br />Molly Ayer, a seventeen year old girl in foster care, reluctantly agrees to help Vivian Daly, a wealthy ninety-one year old woman living in a mansion in Maine clean out her attic, as a way to avoid going to juvie.  Molly can't imagine spending so many hours with an elderly lady, one who she is sure would have no concept of Molly's life.<br /><br />Molly couldn't have been more wrong....<br /><br />As a young child, Vivian's parents left their home in Ireland seeking a better life in America.  Instead of finding happiness in New York, the family was destroyed by a devastating fire.  All alone, Vivian was first sent to an orphanage and then placed on an OrphanTrain headed to the Midwest.  Like many other train riders, Vivian's life in Minnesota was far from easy.  She lost her name (twice), her childhood, and struggled to survive.  But she never lost her spirit....<br /><br />Spanning eighty years, Christina expertly alternates sharing Molly's and Vivian's life - stories of adversity, neglect, love, and resilience. Despite how different these woman's circumstances are their experiences are so similar... and their unlikely friendship is just what they both need....
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I started a new business, read all their education on business facebook pages. I was PAYING for ads and receiving fans. After working on it daily for several months,  one day they shut me down saying I was suspected a fraudulent business. I sent in my id, business license, domain ownership and they just sent me links to why I could possible be deactivated. I wrote them endlessly, explained I didn't violate any of the stuff, and right before Halloween, where I sell costumes they shut me down and will not reactivate or pay me back the money I spent on advertising. They send you a link and never answer your emails after that.<br /><br />I paid employees and now I am hesitant on trying again. BAD BUSINESS FACEBOOK!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Wisdom in clear, fun, easy reading.  A gift of knowledge and honesty from experience.  Very Helpful bbook!  Thank You James.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The product itself is very useful, good quality and good aspect. Only fault so far, there is no chrome cast app for my country in the App Store (Mac)
B008Y212PI|5.0|Just a great game. Absolutely blows away the other Japanese crossword games out there. Instructions rate clear, gameplay is first rate.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I have really enjoyed this kid. I hope that we get to follow him thru his adult life. I think he's going to be a great lawyer or judge.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|This book is my first review on my blog - and what a great one to pick! It had everything a reader wants: imagination, originality and a great, feel good storyline. In addition, the author was very interactive and proactive when it came to a formating problem and some typos. She quickly resolved the issues and I was reading away by the next day.<br /><br />With 11 5* reviews already, it appears that the author is on the path for greatness and I wish her all the best.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Addictkve. Gets progressively more difficult,  which is good. My only gripe is that the puzzles don't look much like the underlying object you're trying to uncover.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The length is great for those outlets that are far behind furniture. Does it's job, have had no problems with it.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Love the actors in this one.  Bruce always plays an over the top kind of super hero but this one was a little more believable.  Loved that it was also funny.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|There's always a song or two that I'm not a huge fan of, but this cd doesn't disappoint.  Love Blake's ability to sing a ballad, then turn around and sing a fun song for singing along with at the top of your lungs. Thanks Blake.
0553565915|5.0|\\"Embraced By The Light\\" is a small book and a fast read. The author talks about her two NDEs, one at a young age and the other when she was 31 years of age.<br />This book is different than most in this category in that it is very detailed.<br /><br />The details of the spiritual realm were intriguing! Pulling the veil back a little between the here and here-after is always interesting.<br /><br />Whether this author is a fraud or legitimate does not take away from the positive message in her book.<br />Service,repentance,knowledge, and not judging others are all things that help us lead better lives.<br /><br />This book is more than an NDE book. It's a manual for leading a more happy spiritual life by helping others.<br />I give it 5 stars and will pass it around to others.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I loved him in Hootie & The Blowfish and love him still in the country genre. Darius is one class act. I'm a True Believer of Darius Rucker music.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I'm not some sort of expert on IT, DevOps or Business, but what I did like about this book is that it was identifiable and the solutions made a lot of sense.  Probably the best bit was that it gave me a framework for thinking through some of the problems my company see's from a birds eye view (VP level), which was pretty cool.  I may just be a little worker bee, but I feel like I have a better grasp of how to help with the big picture.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie had more depth, twists and turns, and human stories of this generation than any I've seen in a long time. Kudos to the very believable actors that made this film come to life.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|What I liked the most was being slowly invited into the Japanese shogunate, its values and ways... And then, I did not want to leave.
B00COCY67A|5.0|I really like this Deluxe Edition Set along with the Booklet.  Was fun to relive a lot of early memories of Elvis.
B00FEN1C50|1.0|How could a movie about giant robots fighting aliens be so incredibly boring?  You'd think they could do better than this.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book years ago (in Afghanistan) as part of the Commandant of the Marine Corps reading list.  After hearing they are making a movie I decided to read it again. Even knowing what was going to happen I still couldn't put it down. It's a great blend of military strategy and human endurance from the perspective of a child. I would recommend it to anyone, especially young people, who have an interest in military leadership and what it takes to lead people through difficult situations. It's also a great story.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Fun and challenging game. Always something new to guess. Hard but you get used to it after awhile. Love it
1476727651|5.0|This novel is the continuation of The Shining - Dan all grown up<br />This book was not the \\"gross terror\\" type of book of the past, but was a wonderful continuation of the original book<br />Dan Torrance is an adult - and has become an alcoholic, as his father was before him. His life has become a series of one town, and one bar - to the next.<br />Finally, he arrives in a north eastern town - and \\"feels\\" it is time to make a change ... time to stay and to turn his life around. With the help of other recovering alcoholics, he does just that. However, he begins having a \\"connection\\" - a \\"shining connection\\" - with someone named Abra. Abra is a little girl who also has the \\"shining\\". Soon, Abra needs Dan's help - her shining is stronger than his and she has managed to attract the attention of a very scarey group of people who prey on children who have the shining.<br />I won't tell you more, but I will say I loved the characters, I loved the story, and I love Stephen King's newer books. He has grown from a horror writer-  into a much deeper and more haunting author  :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy to figure out what you need to do to escape, but it's still challenging to make your way through.
0312330537|1.0|Unbelievably slow moving and dull. Promised a novel involving a drug dealer on the run after a daring prison break, his relationship with underworld characters and prostitutes, living on the edge until a transformation in India, I gave this book 300 pages before giving up. The prison break, told in flash back, was ridiculously uneventful, and the only sketchy character he meets in India are tour guides. Definitely not worth time, money or shipping charges.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The usual Mitch Albom (a good thing).! One of his best (like em' all).<br />Always uplifting stories.Easy reading.Nice message,but not overbearing.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Neil Gaiman is an amazing writer, which is why I gave this book three stars. I've read a ton of his other novels and they are some of my favorites! I am also not an author-hater who bashes authors when they deliver a story that is not to the exact specifications of what I expect or want.<br /><br />The plot was lacking, the story had no resolution and this really felt like it should have remained a short story... As it was originally written. Yes it was well-written and had a lot of potential, but it just did not deliver and has left me feeling almost cheated out of the money I spent on purchasing it.... And that is an entirely new sentiment for me.<br /><br />I can't say that you shouldn't read this book, but I really don't recommend purchasing this book for more than $5.  Sadly, based on its length and quality content, it is not worth much more than that.
B00BD62X14|5.0|I have many albums by Carla Bruni and all have the same clean, simple lightness I find refreshing. For us who do not understand French, the lyrics are printed out in French with an English translation. Very helpful. However, I have a problem with Amazon's Cloud player: In the past, albums I had purchased often showed up on my Cloud account sometimes  before the hard copy CD arrived in my mailbox. This CD did not show up on the Cloud and after giving it a few weeks, I tried to transfer it from my computer file without any success. Finally, after a few more weeks of waiting, it magically  appeared. PS The latest version of Cloud Player is confusing and I am glad it did not automatically supplant my original version, the one I will use until I learn to use the new version or until it is again upgraded.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This movie is just hilarious! The language is pretty dirty but it's all part of what makes it funny. We can watch it over and over and still crack up
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Love this movie,a'lot of action and the zombies just don't wobble and walk...they run!Like a swarm of ants on its prey they are all over the place.This would make a great mini series.I plan on watching it again.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This was very easy to read and very helpful in updating my book. There were a few things it didn't walk you through though, so I'm wondering if some things have changed from when this was first published and maybe just needs to be updated?  I was also using a newer version of word and this was using an older version in the examples. I was still able to easily find what I needed to do though, once I knew what to look for.<br /><br />Great resource! I downloaded it to my iPhone an flipped through the pages as I went through and formatted my book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this collection, but what I found was engaging, exciting storytelling. This is a must-read for fans of dystopian fiction.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|This is a good drawing program for my note 10.1. It's almost as good as the PC version of sketchbook pro.... almost....<br /><br />It does not have the blur tool... ya know... the most important tool ever? Yeah that one, it's strangely absent here.  People have asked autodesk about this, a long time ago it looks like, and they have done nothing to remedy this.<br /><br />It also does not let you customize the interface nearly enough. I can not drag things where I want them, and I can not make everything stay put that I want.<br /><br />For example, I would like the clear canvas button to stay lit up at all times, or the undo button. They are featured on the corners, I can choose which goes on which corner. I can not drag them to exactly where I want. They disappear when you start drawing, along with other toolbars *You can make some toolbars stay with a thumbtack buttons*, why is this a problem? You can't activate them with the pen like this, only tapping twice with your finger.<br />Because you cannot drag these around, on the note or any samsung product it is easy to tap too low on the bottom corners and accidentally open the samsung tray.<br /><br />It does not also let you change what the button on the note pen does * I would like to set it to swap to erease or undo*, I assume this is a universal problem though for any drawing program on the galaxy note?<br /><br />Other then these gripes, it's pretty good. It's about what you know and love from the PC version, and more then functional.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I purchased the app to read to my grandson. It works very well. I would recommend to grandparents that have already introduced the kids to technology.
B004ULNJF8|4.0|Why did I watch this?  Because I wanted to see a gritty Jason Statham kick some heads.  Did I get this?  Yeah.<br /><br />Statham is after a criminal and the police are busters because they don't really have any leads.  But as the investigation unfolds and we find actor Aidan Gillen (whom I recognized but couldn't place--when I was able to place him I realized it was he in the lead villain role in Jackie Chan's Shanghai Knights--he was short of stature but played smug and slightly imperious very well) as the homicidal cop killer, all crick-necked and off-kilter demented, he seems both less than a match for Statham's thuggish cop and his well-coiffed partner who is supposed to make Statham's character a little uncomfortable because he's homosexual (though never aggressively so).  As the film plays the partnership out the truth for both of them is that they're a bit of outside within their own policing world but they make a good team as they are determined to catch the killer.  You know how it ends.<br /><br />Along the way we get a sub-story of a multi-faceted junkie cop that the film helps us develop a really sympathy for and this gives the film more emotional depth.  Of course the criminal has past unexpected ties to Statham's character.  Part of the fun is seeing what this was and how it plays out in his character but...he ends up being pretty one-note.  Still, an enjoyable film and a good (though not great) vehicle for Statham, Gillen, and Zawe Ashton (the junkie cop).
B005PK56TA|5.0|Dark and twisted. Great series and Jessica Lang is wonderful. I always watched it before I went to bed and it creeped me out a little. Watch Asylum next! It's even better!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Okay. I have read through a few reviews on here and want to address a few issues:<br />1. No, the plane challenge can not function on a Kindle Fire due to the lack of a microphone, but you can go to the &quot;OPTIONS&quot; in-game and turn it off.<br />2. The &quot;dress up like a moose during hunting season&quot; challenge works fine on my kindle. You have to keep your fingers held in place while touching all holes.<br />3. The &quot;unrefridgerated pie&quot; death is slightly more difficult on kindle than, say, an iPhone or similar device. Particularly due to the Kindle's screen size. My best suggestion for this is to use multiple fingers as if you were actually using a paper towel to wipe it up.<br />4. Yes, this game is not exactly well suited for children. However, it was created with this message: All the deaths in here are stupid. You would never actually die like this on purpose, so why would you want to ignore train safety? The goal is to drive in the message that, &quot;Dying because you walk across train platforms/stand on the edge of a platform/drive across tracks while bars are down is stupid so be safe around trains.<br />5. Yes, there are ads. There is an easy way to keep them from appearing. Before you launch the app, turn off the Wi-Fi from your device. This is done by going to &quot;SETTINGS&quot;-&gt;&quot;WIRELESS&quot; and turning the Wi-Fi off. This prevents the ads from popping up.<br /><br />Now for the review. The game is an exceptionally addictive time killer. It has it's difficult moments, but would you rather play a game you can beat easily? Didn't think so. I deducted a star due to the appearance of ads whilst running the app with Wi-Fi on and the inability to play the plane challenge, but that's more on Amazon's part. By no means is the game unbeatable. I got a score of 6500 or so earlier today. If a thing or two wa  fixed, then I would most definitely give this app 5 stars. But, for now, it will remain at 4. Hope this review helps withany problems you may have had!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is awesome it test to see things coming.and the rush of seeing what is in a mystery box is so fun because you never know what you will find.that is why subway surfers is the awesomest
B007THA4FI|4.0|I wanted to put this book down several times at the start but remembered another reviewers recommendation to keep going until the half way point when everything picks up. My advice is to do the same. This book reveals complex characters slowly.  I was able to appreciate the characters existence as a complicated human experience where good and evil were so hard to delineate. Very moving read!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|i like the history how was rome the gladiators the war, rome, greece, every europe i nice history i love that
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. The mini games are creative and make it easy to earn extra golf bucks fast.  I also enjoy the trophy challenges.

B003H4I4JU|5.0|I had read Enders Game and was eager to read the next book.  It was so different from Enders Game and I'm so glad I read it.  The way Orson Scott captures the human condition is amazing to me.  Don't miss out on a great book...
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As a Christian this book help me understand Jesus the man from Jesus &#34;the Christ&#34; and how two faithful followers James in Jerusalem and Paul in Roman help start a new religion - Christianity.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I have always loved Jurassic Park, so I jumped at the opportunity to buy the trilogy on blu ray. Great price! Very happy with it.

B005LAIIMG|5.0|I love this movie.  Scared the heck out of me but  I loved it.  The only thing I did not like about the DVD was there was on bonus features.

B004W1GCNC|4.0|If the down time between Downton Abbey is killing you, this will help. Although, it will not replace it; the overall concept is the same.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Finding Pride is a great book.  I really enjoyed the build-up of the characters and locations.  It was an easy read and I am looking forward to completing the series.
B008EKMB82|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a while.  I became so attached to Nao, a 16 year-old girl who struggles with bullying and her father's descent into depression.  The insight into Japanese culture and terminology was fun too, but the supernatural physics part was hard to understand.  I mostly skimmed over that part.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|I have read this several times...Great read...Great book...do yourself a favor and read it...Amazon requires more words...just read it and you won't regret it.
B000K3HTRY|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. The idea of a D/s relationship being in a movie was never attractive to me because I thought it would be portrayed terribly but not in this at all. James Spader is Mr. Grey to me and he'll always be the original.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Ok my kindle is my only option right now to use kik and mow i cant even use it the company needs to get it together ASAP!!!
B000JCQCW4|4.0|I am a huge fan of Darren's movies, and this one is absolutely amazing. The only problem I had with it was the ending, it was so sad and I hoped for better but it is a movie about drugs and addiction so it was kind of expected. Glad I own it.

B0040HO01Y|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE. This is what TV should be! Great acting, superb story lines, intelligent direction. We can't wait to view the rest of the episodes. It's unfortunate production ended after only four seasons. Everything about Larkrise to Candleford is beautifully done.
1401307450|5.0|The best book in the world, anyone who likes the rhcp or Anthony kiedis should read this. I love it
B0091REZMW|4.0|Engrossing and great play..much better than I had anticipated. Addictive, too. Better than watching most anything on tv. Fun, and using your brain, so it's not a total waste of time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|But it is very challenging. My whole family got hooked ok this game.  Please make more levels!! We want to play
B006LSZECO|2.0|Certainly a story full of surprises, but I found it too fantastical. I couldn't find anyone to like in the story.
B005LAII08|5.0|While not quite as kid friendly as other Disney/Pixar outings, we parents quite enjoy the movie.  We were a little afraid of the young daughters getting frightened by some of the fighting bear scenes.  One day it happened to come on TV and the daughter most likely to be scared had not made any sound well past the point we were worried about.<br /><br />It is also 3D, but honestly, the plain BD is used most of the time.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Kids love it and it great gift for them, shipped very quick at very good price and is always in there hands.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I have always liked this movie, so got it for my young daughters.  They like it as well.<br /><br />Classic.  Just a fun, whimsical movie to watch as a family.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Good acting, great cinematography, lush, almost comic-book setting, but a terrible story.<br />Halfway through &#34;Gatsby&#34; it became a predictable tragedy.<br />And, what's with the 1920's era music being overwritten by rap?<br />A 1920's vintage setting with rap and pop in the orchestration was distracting.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thought Downton Abbey was very well done.The stories were very interesting,with fanastic actors.The abbey it- self was very beautiful
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|I love this game but there are a few imperfections 1. Sometimes the graphics get messed up and your character gets its head stuck in the wall/ground. 2. And if you unlock the character (example:dog) dog  after you get granny there is no way to go back to the original character. But other than that this game Is awesome  but dome levels can be a bit hard. :]
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Inspiring, puts dying into a realistic perspective. The characters give realistic insight into a world unknown but wanting to be understood by others.

B0042OZDQG|5.0|If your a fan of Joe Satriani this CD will not disappoint. There are 30 songs and not a bad one in the batch. A \\"Must Have\\" for your collection.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I really loved this portrait of a very complicated man who brought a simply styled elegance to complex systems. The author, I believe, did the same. I recommend this book to anyone interested in design, computers, business, art, modern history, and the list goes on...and probably culminates with the person interested in Steve Jobs (I would add &#34;and men like him&#34; but I can't think of many).
B004JY0KP8|5.0|This watch is beautiful. The face has a very nice off white/beige color to it that differentiates it from other watches and pairs extremely well with the leather style of the watch strap. Seiko is a well respected brand that has been putting out great quality watches out for years now and this is no exception, there is no need to worry about the quality of the inner workings of this watch.<br />Many people have complained about the difficulty of reading the time because of the color of the hands, but I haven't had an issue with it so far. Extremely happy with this purchase, I get compliments on the watch all the time!

B00F7YHDWC|2.0|It is a funny video but a very boring and repetitive game that recycles a very limited number of mini games through with reduced time limits until they can't be accomplished.
B00005JOA0|4.0|No quality issues with viewing this movie. I like the movie, but it did have a couple of areas that was inappropriate for me. Over all I liked. Will I view it again??????
0452273331|4.0|Great book at a great price!  My son had to read for his 11th grade English class and I thought I'd read this classic along with him.  I didn't feel like paying $25 at BN so picking up a used copy in good condition for under $9 (incl. shipping) was a no-brainer.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent, page turning, emotional--GREAT BOOK!!!!!  I did not want to put the book down!!  Perfect for a rainy stay home day!!!
B009RX85N0|2.0|Not half as good as season one. The breaking of the curse was also the breaking of the charm.It's a pity but the magic's gone;

B004X4R49Y|4.0|I really like the acting. Like the fact its a true story. Wished it had cleaner content for a family movie...
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Talk about depressingly beautiful. I've read a few books that have similar themes of man's absolute insignificance in the world but this particular read was awfully evocative. Clarke makes me feel the exact opposite of what 99% of sci fi shoots for: capable, deserving, or full of perseverance.<br /><br />Worth a read, even if only to feel the other side of the coin...
B0054EU0H0|3.0|it doesn't designed for nikon d3200.. it's fitted 80%.. it's ok it will work.. better than nothing because I want to avoid scratches on my lcd

B002GYI9C4|4.0|I admit to being a virgin Sanderson reader.  I picked up M:TFE due to the fact that the trilogy consistently ranks so highly on many fantasy favorite lists. To preface my tastes, I have been a classic high fantasy fan for many years, and have only recently branched out into sub-genres of fantasy.  Thus far I have been mostly pleased with Brandon's work in this first book of the trilogy.<br /><br />The characters are introduced well, and there is plenty of room left to grow through the next two novels (which I admit to having only started the second at this point).  The main protagonists develop rather naturally and are supported by a cast of equally dynamic side characters.  I truly feel that there is a large amount of room for them to grow and I look forward to seeing it happen over the rest of the trilogy.  The story takes place in a tragically desolate world, and leaves plenty of room to explore in the next two books.<br /><br />I could go on with all of the rest of the technical aspects of the book.  It is, for all intents and purposes, an A+ on execution.  The only faults that I can find with it are hard to put into words.  I continually found myself enjoying the scenes playing out, only to have them get bogged down in the nitty gritty details of allomancy.  Brandon's almost scientific approach to magic in this series has all of the proper elements. Its only downside is that it is so dependent on description that it gets repetitive reading about pulling and pushing this and that or burning and flaring.  The flow of the novel is interrupted by its precision.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the rest of the series, and frankly I'm looking forward to starting Brandon's new series that is reportedly shaping up to be his magnum opus.  I want to continue reading Mistborn, but to give that fifth star, I really need to be drawn helplessly into the story, turning pages into the wee hours of the morning and knowing that the heartburn from too much coffee the next daywere absolutely worth it.  I just don't feel that hook pulling me into M:TFE, and for that I give it 4/5 stars.

B007SYWFRM|3.0|My only complaints are the acorns are so hard to get and every time there are updates, the stupid game freezes! I have had to delete twice and reload. I lose everything!

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a very fun game and highly addictive. It has a few glitches but nothing too big that I have found.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Understandable and well worth my time. It increased my knowledge of the time and a past era. I hope to read it again.
0061726834|5.0|Delirium started out as a typical story about a girl living in a world that seems unthinkable to today's society.. But even so, early on I was captivated by Oliver's ability to tie the ideas of love as a disease and control as a benefit into the novel. I continued into the trilogy and it has now become my favorite series.. I'm sure when you're finished, it will become one of yours too!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Definitely a four star book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes stories that take place in Ireland. Interesting interactions with the characters.

B009PMEEY2|4.0|I played this on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with no issues. This is the simplest kind of match-three game: you don't move tiles around, you just select matches that already exist. Doing that removes each match and changes the color of the tile. Your first goal is to make enough matches to turn every tile blue. When that happens, a special piece (talisman) gets dropped into the puzzle, and you have to remove all the pieces below it to make the talisman drop out and end the level. During the first half of the level, making matches where at least one of the tiles isn't already blue fills up your \\"thunder meter,\\" which when full changes the color of random tiles in your favor. As you get deeper into the game, you unlock the talismans as matchable pieces. Matching four or more of each one gets a special effect: an explosion that changes surrounding tiles, a hammer that does the same thing as the thunder meter, etc.<br /><br />All these little bonuses make for fast-paced but very easy levels. Little tweaks like frozen tiles (which have to be at the end of a chain) and locked tiles (which have to have a match made above them to unlock) change gameplay as you progress, but don't make it any harder. There's a timer going, but it's not tight enough to be much of an issue. There's also an \\"expert\\" distinction if you complete levels with more than 50% of the timer left. That's mostly easy too, and the few times it isn't, that's more because of bad random tile generation than because the level is actually difficult. Frustratingly, you can't go back to a previous level if you want to improve your performance. Every few levels there's a bonus level based on the current background image, where the game shows you a small piece of the picture and you tap its equivalent in the larger image. Sometimes they're rotated, but even so these are easy too, and the benefit they offer is so small I don't see what the point is.<br /><br />Visually the game is OK but nothing to write home about, especially on a large HD screen. There's a survival mode that unlocks after completing a little of the story mode if that's your thing. No ads, no in-app purchases. Overall, I'd say this is worth it while it's the free app of the day, but for $2.99 it's a harder sell. If you really like match-three games and want something that will flow right along without ever demanding much skill, this is a great pick. Otherwise, it might not be worth your time. I'm giving it four stars because I had fun with it for what it is, but in terms of design, it's closer to a three-star game.ally on a large HD screen.

B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I loved the movie The Croods.  It was heartfelt & heart warming.  I needed a little pick me up after a long week of negativity in the country.  I adore animations and \\"The Croods\\" does not disappoint.  There are many positive messages in the movie.  One is, 'Sticking together through thick and thin.\\"  \\"And NEVER, EVER, give up.\\"  The positive role between father and daughter was also a surprise. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with this movie. I was smiling the entire time. Children from all ages would certainly enjoy this beautifully animated movie.  Patents as well!  Well done! It's a movie I'd have to say I'd watch again and again.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Another good cinenatic translation of a classic Marvel character retold in modern times but alternate world to ours. Liked it. Not &#34;too goofy&#34; or not too &#34;out there&#34; due to acceptable storyline and good FX. If you're following the Marvel storylines (e.g., Ironman, Avengers, Capt. America, tbd.) you will want to add to your watch list.
1434441636|5.0|I am reading this book at the suggestion of Bob Proctor while I am doing the Science of Getting Rich studies. This book is a perfect compliment to those studies as it delves deeper into what the subconscious mind can do for you.  Very eye opening and worth every penny plus some.

1559409002|5.0|Oct. 4th...I saw this movie years ago and had nightmares...it's on t.v. tonight and I started to watch it but there's something about it that really spooks me....when driving at night, I can't even look out the passenger window - I used to love horror movies when I was a child, watching them with my siblings and cousins...but this one I can't watch.  Really creepy....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Didn't want it to end.  Can't wait for Season 4!!!  Don't know how I missed it the last few years.  Glad it was available for Kindle fire!

1250027624|5.0|I loved the tv-serial and love that history period, so the book was natural extension of that fascination. I would like to read it in a form of a novel as well.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I loved reading this book.  It was well written and understandable.  I do have to admit that I did get a little confused with some of the technical stuff, but not too much as it was so clearly written, that in the long run, I was able to make sense of what was being talked about.<br /><br />Actually, that was what I found so fascinating throughout the whole book - the history of all of the technology and what a big part Apple and Steve Jobs played in it. I do not claim to be a technology history buff, but from reading this book, I came away thinking; where would technology be now if it weren't for Steve Jobs' contribution?  From this book I gathered that Steve Jobs accelerated some of the technology we are enjoying today. Wonderful!<br /><br />We also get to know Steve Jobs in a very open and honest way - he was definitely self-will run riot, not a very nice person, but, oh, so talented.  This book pulls no punches and does not try to soften or portray Steve Jobs other than what he was.  For me, I appreciate that the author and maybe Steve Jobs respected the reader enough not to feed us a load of crap and try to portray him other than what he was.<br /><br />As I was reading the book, I found myself getting more and more sucked into the stories and I found that I wanted to keep reading and not being able to put the book down.  Don't know why as this was by no means that type of book, but it sure had me in its grips.<br /><br />Just one further note, I usually don't read this type of genre as I prefer crime, true crime, and mysteries and thrillers. For some reason, it worked for me and I was sorry when the story ended.

B008Y212PI|3.0|Fun little puzzles that look nothing like their object but it's kinda fun to try and guess in your mind what it is going to be. Completed the whole game in less than an hour...
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|This series although kinda weird in the beginning was so different in a good way. I loved her version of werewolves not like any other of read or watched. I really liked that she made them like real wolves when they had shifted and not this half human half wolf or giant wolf that remembers what happens and controls them selves as if human. I am a sucker for epic love stories so Grace and Sam's story had me reeled in and just intrigued. But I'm even more of a sucker for epic love stories of the untouchable unreachable bad boys that change for that special girl so the Isabelle and Cole romance was just amazing. My only complaint is the ending I want more and she left me with so many questions (I'm sure was the point). Can't she just make one more book to this series. Lol
B003M70O5O|4.0|I'm not really adding thing to other reviews I suppose when I say that I really like this show. Season 2 has a lot of twists and turns, and the premise (Hamlet on motorcycles) still manages to be fresh enough that I can't stop watching.
B001BRAUYM|4.0|Excellent movie!! Good special effects. Hate it when characters make stupid decisions, it's just so Hollywood.  Can't wait to see the latest one.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Fun and easy to manage.  I like the angry birds characters with their grunts and funny mocking, they try to intimidate you.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I downloaded this as a FAOTD not too long ago.  I had played another Novosoft game, so I thought I might enjoy this one as well.  This one is not quite as fun, but I do like playing it.  There is sometimes too much dialogue between missions, so sometimes I'll just zip through that part.  I agree with another reviewer about docking 20 seconds for &quot;random&quot; taps, when the taps are not random to me - that is rather irritating.  Also, I'm not a big fan of the missions where there is not much light in the room to find objects, but if I turn my lights off, those become easier to complete.  Still, it is a fun game.  I play this on my Kindle Fire HD with no problems.

White zombie started out as a noise rock but then thrusted into the 1990s Groove Metal scene with Astrocreep.  It begins with the quote \\"perhaps you better start from the beginning\\" and thrusts into a masterpiece of creepy lyrics and sounds.<br /><br />Is it any good? 5/5<br /><br />Astrocreep is somehow different from the other shock rock albums that have come out at this stage in the 1990s.  Some of the songs could be an interesting soundtrack for a haunted house.  Yet due to the rather grotesque subject matter in the songs I would not recommend this album to any kids.  Song titles such as \\"Grease paint and Monkey Brains and blood Milk & Sky\\" suggest a violent message.  But if you pay attention to the music rather than the lyrics you would see especially if you are a fan of many of the newer metal bands out there, you would see that White Zombie has influenced the vocal style of most of today's commercial metal.  The lyrics may get a little gross at times but it is a must for those who are into contemporary metal.  We must note there is an edited version but the edited version is not the best so it may be a good Idea not to let your kids get this one.<br /><br />Families can talk about.<br /><br />White Zombie's grotesque lyrics and how their music is diffierent from bands like Lorn & Marilyn Manson.<br />Why do certain metal bands use shock values in their lyrics?<br /><br />Music details<br /><br />Artist: White Zombie<br />Genre: Heavy Metal<br />Label: Geffen<br />Parental Advisory: Yes<br />Edited version: Yesue lyrics and how their music is diffierent from bands like Lorn & Marilyn Manson.<br />Why do certain metal bands use shock values in their lyrics?<br /><br />Music details<br /><br />Artist: White Zombie<br />Genre: Heavy Metal<br />Label: Geffen<br />Parental Advisory: Yes<br />Edited version: Yes
B004FOA84A|5.0|Please hurry and create more games like this one. They play great on Kindle Fire. Simply wonderful. Words can't describe. I HATE HATE hidden object seek games. Fine for children not for a more mature clientele. We need more like this, The Room and Lost City. GO TO WORK.

B000I8ES5C|1.0|This is the Chinese Language Version. No where does it say it is the Chinese Language Version. Don't buy this unless you speak Chinese.
B00E0SX118|5.0|I watched this by myself and actually laughed out loud a few times. It's very entertaining throughout. Epic landscapes, really beautiful movie.<br /><br />The family is barbaric and ignorant and their belief system reflects this. Fear of the unknown and pridefully simple-minded is their way but instead of keeping them safe as it has for so long now it will be their downfall. They meet an innovative character. A real charmer who has skills and intelligence. Their reaction to him at times is absolutely hilarious. The family fire scene is a riot and the one where the boy and girl meet is lovely.<br /><br />The \\"message\\" is very naturally weaved into the story. It basically IS the story. In general it observes Man's key survival traits - intelligence and ideas but being curious is a necessity as well. Resentment and jealousy are pitiful traits and this movie deals with them by demanding a change of ways. It's about survival in this case so no time to feel sorry for someone feeling inadequate and petty. It's about RISING to the occasion and boy does he in the most grand fashion.<br /><br />I can't think of another animated film that I enjoyed as much as this one. I would say Finding Nemo and Monsters vs Aliens are the only other ones that I really liked.

B003B02O14|5.0|This book holds one's attention throughout.  Those with close ties to the business world will identify with the entanglements revealed.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Worth a quick read.  Cheryl puts her life back together by getting out into the woods.  A very frank self analysis combined with a travelogue.
B004S9AK9U|5.0|This is a thought provoking book. It stretches the boundaries but isn't so far out there to be altogether kooky. Beautifully written.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I really liked this book. All gifted children and people who know gifted children should read this book. It also works on other levels :-)

B000MQC9H4|4.0|The Holiday 4.5 stars and love ★♥<br /><br />The Holiday is a 2006 American romantic comedy film written, produced and directed by Nancy Meyers. Stars Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet as two women from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, who decide to house swap in order to escape their heartbreak during the holiday season. Also stars Jude Law, Jack Black, Edward Burns and Rufus Sewell.<br /><br />I rewatched this the other night. I really like this movie. It's not just a romance or holiday movie for me. Cameron was ok in this. I suppose her ditzy carefreeand emotionless personality fits here and not much acting needed from her. I love Kaye Winslet. I think her and Jack were perfect together for this. And I liked Jude Law in this.
B001TOD92C|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, it is well worth seeing. It is about life. Life is good, it gets difficult, we get knocked down, and either stay down, or keep trying to get back up.<br /><br />Wrestling and all he goes through to make a few bucks, , is the metaphor for life, and how we all do what we have to , with what we have, to survive, and how lonely life can be. When we realize our mortality is limited, we want more connection.<br /><br />We all do our best, and when one can find meaning and connection with other people, life is better, but this isn't always possible. It's kind of on the sad side, showing just how hard it can get... it reminds me of Mickey Rourke's real life story and the struggles he's gone through in his own life, and how it humbles one. I can relate to it on many levels. It's a well made film, no frills, no special effects, just real actors, a great story, a great script, great acting, and story telling.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|I didn't expect what this cd is, thinking their time was much over after the early 80's. I can't think of many cd's where literally every song is awesome, but this one rocks.  It is DEVO at their best, on steroids and sounds contemporary with a hint of the past, only better. The lyrics are typical DEVO, humorous, commenting on society and it's world at that present time. At times the words make you laugh, and at times one gets blown away with their precision and execution. The production is brilliant and each musician plays and sounds off the chart.  I missed this one when it came out, and hope that they will put out another cd with the same producer, intensity and strong material! DEVO RULES ONCE AGAIN!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Was first introduced to these puzzles on shock wave. So excited to find them for my kindle too. I love working my brain and having fun too. Recommended for anyone who likes logic puzzles<br />.

B0017QSZW6|3.0|The first season was better, I felt .  It is getting a little boring watching them all go through the same dramas over and over. Everything is being dragged on too long.  Not sure if i will spend the time to watch season 3.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Amazing ! So closely following history while intertwining a true heartfelt story that can so easily be believed as the true thoughts of the actual historical figures that the book portrays. I laughed. I cried. I could relate to the true humanness of even a royal family. A must read !

B002QRWJA4|5.0|Great music, great acting, sexy phantom.  What more could a girl want in a movie? Maybe a friend and a latte to watch it with her.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Update: So I just finished the \\"Adventure\\" part of the game, after a couple hours of intermittent play. When you finish, you can select any level to re-play, or play in the \\"survival\\" mode.<br /><br />BASIC GAMEPLAY: This is a variation of your basic \\"match to remove\\" puzzle game (e.g. Bejweled or Candy Crush, without the switching). The board is tiled, with items in each tile. You swipe to remove 3+ identical items in a row to remove them, and any tile you swipe on turns blue. The basic objective of the game is to turn the whole board blue, which clears a sublevel; there are 10 levels, with about ~6 sublevels of gameplay each (which take about a minute each). For the first six levels, completing a sublevel earns a piece of a talisman--these give you special abilities (e.g. 4+ hammers makes a hammer knock a tile blue).<br /><br />As you progress in levels, there is more variety in items, making it more challenging to swipe 3+ of the same type. It's pretty easy until the last level or two; not really  a challenging game, but still fun. Complete all the levels in \\"adventure mode\\" to unlock survival mode (i.e. infinite gameplay).<br /><br />PROS:<br />DECENT GRAPHICS/SOUND - you can tell this app wasn't made by an amateur in his basement; the graphics and sound are pretty decent. Can't say the same for a lot of other Amazon FAOTD's.<br />INTUITIVE GAMEPLAY - no complicated instructions, it's all pretty straightforward.<br />FREE (on 10/05/13) - always a plus, right?<br />NO ADS, NO SUSPICIOUS PERMISSIONS, NO IN-STORE PURCHASES - I've noticed that some of the FAOTD games were made specifically to advertise and/or collect information and/or set limitations to force in-app purchases; this is certainly not one of those apps. You get what you get--you don't need to buy time or special coins with real money. It only requires network access b/c the developer provides a link to other games on the home page.<br /><br />RELAXING - the timer gives you ample time, and the background music is zen; this is not the type of game where you spend every second trying to beat the clock.

B007AL48UK|4.0|Good break from my Winter Mahjong.  Sometime is does freezes near end of game and screws up my time.  Good game for free.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very adult, well written and amusing, can't wait to order the question mark. I'll do it now. My inner self demands that I do.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Loved the movie, once I finally got to see it all, and the product arrived promptly and well packaged for protection.  I would definitely purchase through this seller again!<br />My son gets to watch the movie occasionally, as it was his 2nd birthday present and he loves the Cars movies, but still too young for the 3d, so havent even used that disk yet.
B00000FC5H|5.0|This is an outstanding collection of  music from Earth, Wind, and Fire. Great melodies, voices, and great sounds. I highly recommend this to older and newer EWF fans! It is definitely top-notch music!!!
B004WE01YA|5.0|I love Disney movies and always have, no shame in it.<br />I muist say, I have never seen Beauty and the Beast look so beautiful before.  The 3d is great to watch and even the regular blu ray is just so vivid with the remastering.  Well worth the purchase and is a timeless classic.<br />I wuld definitely go through this seller again and the item arrived quickly and well packaged.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|The whole album is great.  Any of these songs could be on the radio. Best rap album out right now.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Yes, there are some familiar songs, but a few new ones as well.  I love Jimi Hendrix and this CD is a great addition to my collection.  I waited for some time for it to come out after I heard about its imminent release.  It was well worth the wait.
B000063UR1|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and couldn't find it anywhere else.  Was just like I remembered it.  After returning from a trip to Big Bear Lake this movie came to mind.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Tough to put down. I found the many individual accounts woven together to tell the entire story made for a great read!
B001IF277K|5.0|meets my standards for a good price. Was instantly comparable no need to guess and check . Worth the money
B00127RAJY|5.0|The best work out for limited time and needing results! I recommend this to all of my friends that need a fast work out! So far have gotten 3 people on the bandwagon too!
B00CTT9646|5.0|Got this gift set for my partner . Opened the box and was blown away when he saw the replica phaser. The only disappointing thing is its a pity the phaser wasn't made with sound effects, apart  from that its great.
B000RO9VJK|4.0|Great read and really helps you think about the reasons you go into business.  All owners need to have this on their shelves with well worn pages.
B005544V6A|5.0|Am amazing body of work. Dialogue superb, acting super, storyline intriguing......everything in one package AND the best job of being a &#34;villain &#34; ever!!!
B0007KVAVG|5.0|Hell of an album with every single track being very good. I can listen to this over and over and it ranks up there with 'Vengeance and British Steel.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Interesting thing about Hugh Laurie's music . . . it gets better every time I hear it . . . he and his group offer really deep satisfaction musically, soulfully, and in terms of arrangements and complementing each other. I made a longer review for the other album since I bought them both together. Many reviewers have preferred this one but I like them both. There's just something so poignant about the A minor life experience that we all have in our differing ways.<br /><br />If I had to choose one of his albums to buy first I guess it would be this one but I like them both. The man has talent and knows what to do with it.
142311339X|5.0|The book was for my granddaughter. the price was amazing, a hard cover in excellent condition. I will definitely order more books. Thanks
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Dredd is a worthy pseudo-sequel to Judge Dredd, and if I may so, also a significant improvement on that movie. The unseeming heroine of the film is likewise a worthy successor of Judge Dredd's idealism. The movie is absolutely worth 4 stars, but falls short of a fifth primarily as excessive violence, blood, and gore are present which do nothing to enhance the quality of the story.
B000001DQI|5.0|One of Elton John and Bernie Taupin's best. Songs of the time. I remember wearing out a couple of the vinyl versions of it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I devoured this book in less than 4 days, work and the rest of my life be damned.  It's certainly a page turner with a wonderful insight into the human psyche.  But it's also an indictment of men and women of the species and our inherent weaknesses and foibles. Highly recommended if only for the psychological introspection of both Amy and Nick, but also for defining the hidden and damaged souls in our midst known clinically as sociopaths. But who we refer to as sister, brother, mother, father, daughter, son......
B008KH8XRC|5.0|Would recommend this to anyone that likes 70's raw guitar. Music in the vein of Humble Pie. Great guitarist and writer.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Everything about this movie was top notch.  Story, acting, editing, camera, script--everything.  The depressing storyline almost scared me away--already feeling depressed--but the really sad parts were so well balanced that the story's real theme, hope, kept surfacing.  The ending was truly a thumbs up for getting over depression.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book did not disappoint, just like the first.  So much goes on!  And it is just so darn intense!!!!
0307346617|5.0|I love reading and I love stories about Zombies, so this was a must-buy for me.<br /><br />My sister had the original copy but a friend had borrowed it and lost it. Fortunately for me I have Amazon Prime so I was able to order this and read it before watching the movie that would come out later that year.<br /><br />I would say read the book before watching the movie, I'm glad the cover hadn't changed yet!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I enjoy my Google Chromecast. I wish it worked with my Amazon Prime Movies. Right now it is very limited, YouTube and Netflix. I hope there is more support soon. The one thing I noticed is it gets pretty warm for it's size. Because of this I got out my trusty Kill A Watt (TM) device and measured the power consumption. When it's power cube is connected the Chromecast consumes 4 watts of power. This is true whether it is connected to your television or not. If you unplug it from the power cable, the power cube shows no power consumption. Because this device will get limited use for now, I will be unplugging it except when I want to use it. It only takes a few seconds to start up when power is applied.<br /><br />I also have a Roku box and it's power consumption is 6 watts. As with the Chormecast, there is no power switch so it is consuming power whether you are watching on it or not.<br /><br />There is so much great programming on YouTube I feel my money was well spent. The video quality is excellent. I have no complaints with the product so far. With more support, I would give it five stars.
B005LAII3A|5.0|Thought it was a great flick - better than Arnold's! Good casting and fast moving plot - Neat special effects
B004ADH1RI|4.0|The Goonies is a classic! I shared with a handful of students when then rest of the class was on a trip.  They had no idea and couldn't wait to get home to rent it and see the ending.
B002S0KB1S|5.0|I have to say this was like Ozzy telling you the stories himself.  What an incredible life this man has lived.  Like Ozzy I'm really not sure how he's still with us!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I just got into PC gaming a few years ago and my biggest gripe was being bent over a keyboard in a pretty uncomfortable position, plus I'm not good at finding the keys and playing the game at the same time. This keyboard does a great job of condensing the keys to just the ones you need and it's very comfortable with it's ergonomic design, my hand has not cramped up since using it. You can program each button to do anything you need. Right now, I run a recording software during my game to record cutscenes and I have a button set up to record the game! All in all, this is a great keyboard and it's worth the price in my humble opinion.<br />My only complaint isn't with the product but the instructions or should I say LACK of instructions. There are no instructions, just a link to the support website for all of logitech's gaming keyboards.<br />For those interested in this<br />First download the gaming keyboard software and the software will recognize the keyboard.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I TRULY ENJOYED READING THIS,IT WAS GREAT GETTING TO BE BACK WITH DANNY AND WENDY.AFTER READING THIS , I REREAD THE SHINING AND NOW I AM GOING TO READ THIS AGAIN. ITS ALWAYS BETTER THE SECOND TIME AROUND. THANKS STEPHEN KING.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Straight out of the box the Behringer Xenyx 802 was ready to go. Coupled with my Carvin 2500 watts power amp this little giant was up to the task of powering my keyboard and 5 microphones in our modest size church sanctuary. The fact that this piece of equipment does not have sliding switches means that it will last for a very long time, debugging the awkward scratching noise that tend to plague sliding switch equipment after a while. I recommend this product to anyone who has a garage band to the professional who has a small recording studio or even small and mid sized churches. Again it is truly an excellent Product.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I bought this CD after viewing the movie on DVD and can say without a doubt that this is some of the best music I have ever heard.  The CD was in excellent condition.  Looking forward to exploring this great team further.
B001NFT3Z4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! The acting is terrific and the plot keeps you watching to see what will happen next. Thanks and God Bless!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its so worth your money I play it every day that I can you can even play with other people the only thing bad about it is it needs to be updated at least to 6.1 because it would be easy to update right? well untill the update it its still a great game once it upgrades I lt will be why better than befor
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I wanted to start watching this series but didn't know what it was about. Finding the back seasons for free with my Amazon Prime was awesome. Go prime!
B002VECM72|5.0|It's a great movie but it was bought as a gift. My niece is a big Sandra Bullock fan and we both love football. I have watched Michael play in many games since seeing this movie.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I loved the characterization and that held me through the most fantastic parts of the story. At times, I was tired of all of the action and needed more emotion, but it was a fun read in the end.
B002APU580|5.0|Of course this is a famous love story and the makers did great. Everything about this film is fabulous , acting, script, set, scenography and costume and everything else. Great humor, really notting like British humor !<br /> Classics if not done right can be old and dusty and tiresome, not this film.It is entirely fresh and timeless .<br />Well you get my drift, a sound peace of entertainment !
1572814136|5.0|I love the coloring and design of this edition and actually feel like I might get more interested in Tarot.  I'm a sucker for good artwork and this fits the bill, and is more cheerful (which I hope leads to more cheerful readings-ha!)
B00140PK6O|1.0|Love the DVDs but when I opened the package the last disc was so scratched and broken it was unwatchable. Very disappointed!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Dr. Sleep was an interesting story that I couldn't put down. I loved everything about psychic ability, the AA and hitting bottom experience, and felt the story was a believable story about what happened to Danny, the little boy from the Shining. Rose and Abra were interesting characters. My one criticism is that I found the antagonists a bit weak beyond the scene with the baseball boy. Thanks for another great read Mr. King. I read my first King book when I was 12 and it was Christine. I am now 40 and love your books. My first purchase on the Kindle.
B00BSZZA3I|4.0|Alright, I hope to help as many people as I can, so I waited a couple of weeks after getting the case before writing a review.<br /><br />The Pros: It looks GOOD. Like real damn good. It gives your htc a really stylish look and a lot of my friends have complimented me on what a cool case I have. Also, while HTC itself does not manufacture it, it appears that they did design it in some way, as they have included all the necessary speaker and microphone holes. A big thing with HTC One cases is that most cover up the microphone on the back. This one doesnt, it has a little hole specifically for this. Finally, the actual flip case is convenient. Most phone cases that stand up on their own have a big clip in the back that makes the phone much thicker, but this case actually utilizes the cover and half of the back to create the stand. This means that it is less bulky. Also, the cover does not have a magnet, but after you use it a few days, it will always stick to the screen, so those who say that the cover does not stay on the screen probably have not used it long enough.<br /><br />The Cons: It is not the greatest protector, but if you are a person who usually never drops their phone then you should be completely fine. Also, in order to create the stand, you must create a crease in the back in order to use the back to prop the phone against. This crease can look a bit weird, but so far, that is the only problem. Another con is that the side of the phone with the volume control is completely uncovered. Finally, the last concern is that the ends of the case are made of plastic in order to grip the phone. These ends can sometimes slip off if you fiddle with them, but they wont do it on their own.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are a careful person who takes care of their phone and rarely drops it, I would highly recommend it.<br />To any one looking for good fall protection: it may take a couple of 3 foot drops, but dont expect it to do miracles.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This books first half with his perception of when he was a child growing up was just wonderful. It was not pretentious or brow beating or &#34; I can do it so can you&#34; in it's presentation. It was a lesson being taught through the eyes of himself as a kid growing up. It felt genuine and not overly contrived. It made understanding that mindset easy to comprehend and grasp. It is so far the best and most reader friendly type of book so far in this genre. Which makes sense because most personal motivators and life changers out there read this book before or during their process. I think it is the first book anyone should read to change their mindset about money and the money trap. It will hook you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game.. If you are as big as fan of the minions then you will love this game too!!!
B00594MB2M|3.0|As others have said, I would say this film is interesting, good, but not great. Nice to see Paris and found some inspiration from the main character. But will search for another Parisian film.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This is one of the most beautifully photographed movies I have ever seen in my life.  The story is enormous.  I would recommend renting or buying this movie to anyone!  One of the best purchases I have ever made.  This movie is definitely a part of my personal collection of all-time favorite DVD's!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|World war Z oops!,,The idea is great, the script well needs some work. I was expexcting some closure. Amazon services are great a total fan.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fantastic read keeps you engaged throughout the story, a more in depth look at the relationship dynamics of CG and Anna.
B0016CVN02|5.0|Hot rocks really rocks. The collection is perfect. The sound is great. Seat back and enjoy.5 stars from a happy guy
1596680180|3.0|The book is a little difficult to understand and a bit overwhelming at first.  If you are already into braiding it will be a great addition, but I wouldn't recommend it to beginners.
B0052RDHTM|1.0|The book is written in simple form and not literary in the least.  Characters are flat and one dimensional.  They are shallow, predictable, and do not developed as the plot progresses.  The background storyline is interesting, but told in a mundane, mater-of-fact way.  You as a reader will not need an imagination, will not be challenged, will not need a dictionary, and put the thesaurus away.  No descriptive passages are to be found, and few literary techniques are utilized in this large narrative.  This is an uncomplicated book written at high school level.<br /><br />There are so many excellent books to be found and read, I would recommend not wasting the hours it would take to trudge through this behemoth, and certainly not the 2 subsequent in the series.<br /><br />h
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved &#34;The Fault In Our Stars&#34;. It was really sad, but it was still a very good story. I couldn't put it down for 2 days. It was so much more than &#34;okay&#34;
B002KC8BSO|4.0|Not sure why I waited so long to watch this film (and its predecessors). Unabashedly campy and silly, and just funny as he'll and very quotable.
B00ENBTI8C|3.0|I enjoyed Season 1 and the prequel was fine. Liam McIntyre did a great job of making Spartacus his own, but I can only give this season three stars because it's hard for me to believe that the women protrayed here Nevia being the main character, as fearsome warriors able to beat battle seasoned veterans. It was really absurd.
B0014GVCI8|5.0|Juno is a deadpan, no-nonsense teen who knows her limitations. When she has sex for the first time with a friend she likes, she becomes pregnant. She tries to go to a clinic but can't go through with it when a classmate protesting tells her the baby has fingernails. She sets out with the support of her friends and family to find a good couple to love and raise the baby. Her relationship with Paulie (the baby's father) also provides comedy along the way.<br /><br />This is such a sensitive topic that in the hands of lesser actors, directors and writers would have been offensive and wrong. The team that made Juno did an amazing job! It is truly a sweet and funny film that provides laughs and a few tears as you watch a teen who is looking for the perfect couple stumble through adult problems. It has a beautiful ending, not sappy, but realistic.
1401312853|5.0|This is not a book I expected to like.  I'm more for the action-packed, page-turner kind of book where you are kept at the edge of your seat (or bed).  And that is the polar opposite of this story.<br /><br />It starts slowly, in human pre-history and jump-starts in modern-day (specifically December 2012, awaiting the Mayan Apocalypse).  It's a provocative tale about time and our relation to it.  How we define it and, more importantly, how it defines us.  Albom clearly wrapped his brain around these concepts for quite some time before tuning them into this story.<br /><br />So, no, I wasn't rushing through this waiting to see what happened next; instead I found myself periodically closing the book and ruminating upon the thoughts I was just provided, seeing new relationships in how time and society interact.<br /><br />It would be a bit grandiose to say this book changed my life, but I will say it changed how I look at it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I actually bought this book for my dad, but I was so intrigued I decided to read it myself.  This book has deepened my belief of an afterlife even more, and I hope my dad's too.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I bought the disc 10 years ago and tried to listen on many systems, but nothing could hide the fact that this was a lousy mastering job. It blew me away that some people were writing reviews stating that there was nothing wrong with the mastering. I think I threw the old disk away.<br /><br />I was going to buy the re-mastered Vapor Trails disk from Amazon today but decided against it when I found out that HDTracks was also selling this in Hi-Res. So I went to HDTracks and bought that version instead, I am listening to this version now on my KEF LS50 computer speakers. What a great disc, my suspicions 10 years ago are confirmed, there is great music on this disc. A top 10 RUSH disc , maybe higher with more listens.<br /><br />Amazon, be a leader and sell Hi-Res downloads.
B008MM9630|4.0|This is one of my favorite games. The graphics are really, really pretty. It's fun to grow plants and add other things. My only gripes about game app is I wish the pictures in the menu shop were larger and that it didn't take so long to acquire more land space.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOUSE. End of story. It has 5 DPI settings with each customizable per profile (which you can have 3 of plus the default) There are multiple buttons for keybinds or macros. The glow is fantastic and its feel to use is phenomenal. I HIGHLY recommend this mouse to ANYONE.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I was just amazed at how extremely bright my flashlight on my cell phone is even my kid couldn't believe it was coming from my cell!
B005Z5F5VE|5.0|How does a band famous for &#34;With or Without You,&#34; &#34;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking for,&#34; and &#34;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#34; move on?  Listen to the opening track's industrial sounds and follow it through the electronic buzz on &#34;Even Better than the Real Thing,&#34; the gentle and poignant &#34;One,&#34; the soaring &#34;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses,&#34; or the grooves on &#34;The Fly&#34;.  You'll see U2 in a new light.
1846573785|5.0|Had to find out what all the hub-ub was about and was plenty surprised to get more story than anticipated.<br />Would definately recommend the series.
B0064Y3RHY|5.0|Yes, the hits like &#34;Miss You,&#34; &#34;Beast of Burden,&#34; and &#34;Shattered&#34; are here, but go past them to the deep cuts like &#34;Far Away Eyes,&#34; &#34;Respectable,&#34; &#34;Before They Make Me Run,&#34; and &#34;When the Whip Comes Down.&#34;  Even the title track is groovy.  If you're no prude but love guitar riffs and Jagger's voice, you'll love this.
B008Y212PI|5.0|love the 5 x 5 squares.  lots of fun and not too narrow.  tried the 10 x 10 squares and it hurts my brain and takes a while to finish.  should be played by middle school kids.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was given to read as a assignment in one of my classes.  I wasn't expecting this book to be so interesting. I couldn't put this book down. I loved it!!!
B0000714BP|5.0|I friend made me watch this: I was skeptical, but it was so good! It's a surprisingly funny and heartwarming tale of 3 drag queens whose car breaks down in small town America as they're headed to a national drag competition. They then proceed to jazz up the town (and its women) for an annual strawberry festival. It's fairly predictable, but very cute.
B009CF3MEK|1.0|I can't believe I never saw this movie before.  If they had Oscars for worst actress, worst director, worst cinematography and worst editing, this movie would sweep them.  I found myself wondering what Robert Redford was doing in the midst of this and was so grateful it didn't ruin his career.  The new Gatsby movie prompted me to watch this one.  I wish I hadn't.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun guilty pleasure game. Enjoying playing it when I want a relatively easy game. My son enjoys seeing the pictures.<br /> Will try another one soon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My son had to read this book for his 6th grade reading class, so  I decide to take a little look and I couldn't stop till the end of the book<br />It is great and entertaining both for kids and adults
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I needed this function on my kindle....very well designed......only small concern was developer would intrude on personal info...so far-so good.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Great movie. Our boys loved it. We've seen it twice now since its release and they keep talking about their favorite parts.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Thanks for this app! My game apps work better now on my kindle fire! i highly recommend this app to spiff up your kindle fire!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was so simple to order.  This is my first book purchase for my tablet.  Android layout is landscape instead of portrait so is not as easy to read as I had hoped.  Much easier to handle tablet than a book.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I love this movie and it is great for everybody to watch as a family love it buy more again soon
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun for kids!there is so much obstacles to get past! I love playing this game because it has so many battles against evildoers!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Love this movie...but not very good quality of stream....Wish you would improve it and everyone will be happy to watch it online!
B000SEGSB8|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I had never ready anything by Tony Judt, and I was pleased how engaging I found thus to be. It is an overview of the continent but Germany, France, Briton and the Soviet Union get the most attention. Anyone who is interested in how \\"new Europe\\" came to be would enjoy Postwar.
B00973902K|5.0|Without any doubt, this is the best song ever sang, although I prefer the singing by ImmortalHD. N 4 L
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My kids took me to this musical and I so enjoyed everything about it.  I just love this fabulous CD.
