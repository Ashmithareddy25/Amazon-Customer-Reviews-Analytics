0446580848|2.0|The sixth book in the John Corey franchise is worthy, but just barely.  Other reviewers have commented on Corey's interjection of a smart remark to everything.  I thought they were maybe unfamiliar with the franchise, in past books I've found Corey's attitude and remarks funny and often right on.  But in this book, there is much too much of it.  Almost literally every thought he expresses is some version of smart aleck, and consequently the asides don't catch you unawares, are not funny and all too often aren't even insightful.  One long scene early in the book where Corey and his wife are getting a cultural briefing on Yemen just goes on and on and I'll bet that's the point where a lot of people put this book down, I was certainly tempted.<br /><br />But I'm glad I stayed with it.  Things get a little better once they get to Yemen (wow, is that ironic!) and Corey isn't quite as \\"clever\\" in the latter pages.  But the plot is pretty pedestrian and moves slowly, with minimal surprises.  And unlike the Lion books, where the story switches to the Lion's point of view, this book is all Corey all the time.  And frankly he wears out his welcome.<br /><br />So why am I glad I stayed with it?  Because I liked \\"The Lion\\" and loved \\"Night Fall\\" so I have a soft spot for this franchise and I expect to read more in the future.  Like \\"Wild Fire\\", this is a forgettable, read it only once, installment in the series, but good enough to not feel that time was wasted and perhaps useful background for the next books.

B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I was hoping that it would be hilarious being that Seth McFarland was involved and being a big fan of his other projects like Family Guy. It had a few good laughs and it's a great premise but it ends up being just okay. I think Seth McFarland's strength lies in the cutaway scenes to absurd situations to exaggerate a point like in Family Guy. Definitely glad I waited to see it via stream instead of going to the theatre.
0740797719|5.0|I'm a professional photo retoucher with a college degree in film and about 6 years experience in the photo industry. So I thought I was pretty well versed in things like color and light.<br /><br />Once I started getting high-end clients, just knowing how to use Photoshop wasn't going to cut it. I found myself needing to know a LOT more about illustration- painting in particular. So, I started in on the drawing and painting books. I bought dozens of them and most of them wound up getting sent straight to a donation bin for whatever local charity would come take them off my hands.<br /><br />Then...along comes this holy grail of color and light.<br /><br />It changed my entire perspective on how I retouch. It changed my outlook on how I approach photography and film making. Heck, it even changed how I choose to light my own home. I've learned more useful little tricks and valuable information from this book than I did in many of my classes in college.

030758836X|3.0|I stumbled upon this book when I was reading an interview with Cindy Crawford in December's issue of Shape when they asked what she was reading & she said she was reading Gone Girl & thought why not. It was a very interesting read as it was told from the two primary characters points of view. An ordinary marriage, with the hope of love eternal & things go rapidly south with job losses, family obligations & a move back to Nick's hometown. You are then lead down one path & then another & then wait, what the hell just happened? Did that really happen? Holy crap! The twists & turns were excellent, but I have to agree with some of the less positive reviews that the ending wasn't that spectacular. Considering everything that occurred, you would think that the author would have been able to deliver a more powerful punch to the ending.

B002VHI8J0|3.0|I read this novel primarily in order to be able to understand the movie. In this respect, it worked very well as I was able to follow the movie - though it does deviate from the novel - as well as the incredibly difficult to understand accents for one portion of the movie. My husband, who hadn't read the novel, found the entire movie incomprehensible.<br /><br />The central conceit - and the basis for the construction of the novel - is a single soul living through six lives at different points in time. The movie makes too much of this, while the novel has far more interesting themes. In particular, one of the central themes of the novel is \\"what makes human beings civilised?\\" or \\"what makes people good?\\". While the novel doesn't provide any pat answers, it does stimulate interesting thought.<br /><br />In terms of the plot and characters, I didn't find any single piece particularly original. Most of the storylines have been used somewhere else and some of the characters are downright annoying - what makes the book powerful is how all the stories are stitched together.<br /><br />Sylistically, the book is also satisfying as the author effortlessly flows from one style (journals to letters etc) and from one voice to another. The six sections of the book all have very different point-of-view characters - although all supposedly one soul - and each of these is faithfully portrayed. Also, as the book moves through time, it starts in a historical style and ends with two sections of science fiction. The more widely you read, the less original any section will feel but the more you will appreciate how it all fits together.<br /><br />The movies makes much of the idea of re-incarnation and love enduring through time. For me, the novel says very little about these themes and if you're looking for a dramatic insight into re-incarnation, this book is not for you. What it says about human nature is far more interesting, and if this interests you, then read this book.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I'm very disappointed with the poor, almost juvenile quality of writing and with the author's attempt of humour. His terse thoughts and narrative result in a jerky style that doesn't flow well and even though he throws in a fair number of humorous asides - they usually fall very flat. As well, his writing tends to be merely an opportunity to provide pages of propaganda for the United States efforts at bringing those 'evil' Yemenis to task. Once the author gets into the main theme - the quest to apprehend 'The Panther' it flows better; but there are too many dead spots that should have been omitted from his writing. I would not buy another book written by this author and I regret paying almost $13 for this one.

B00006GO9Q|5.0|\\"In a Silent Way\\" is a beautiful record. It has many subtle charms and takes time to be fully appreciated. I have been playing this record for years and I still find new things in the music. The album signalled a new direction in jazz, Miles had abandoned the traditional formula of theme-solo-theme and began making improvised music using electric guitar and keyboards. The album was recorded in February 1969.<br /><br />Great jazz albums need great musicians and Miles assembled a great band for this album. Many of the future leaders of the jazz-rock movement appear on this record: Wayne Shorter - saxophone, John McLaughlin - guitar, Chick Corea - electric piano, Herbie Hancock - electric piano, Joe Zawinul - organ, Dave Holland - bass, and Tony Williams - drums.<br /><br />Miles' final all-acoustic album \\"Nefertiti\\" was recorded in 1967. With his next album \\"Miles in the Sky,\\" Davis began to experiment with electric instruments. \\"In a Silent Way\\" is still a jazz album it has Dave Holland on double bass and Tony Williams plays like a jazz drummer. Miles' music was moving in an abstract direction. There are no real songs, instead there are gentle, collective, group improvisations punctuated with solos from Miles, Wayne Shorter and John McLaughlin. It is very enjoyable and holds up well today.<br /><br />In a Silent Way is not really a jazz-rock album. It does not sound like the Mahavishnu Orchestra or Return to Forever. This album is not what a Zeppelin or Stones fan in 1969 would recognize as rock, the music is just too abstract. The album only reached #134 on the Billboard charts and it was not a huge commercial success.<br /><br />With Miles' next album \\"Bitches Brew\\" he increased the level of absraction and added a powerful groove, utilizing up to four drummers. During the deriod 1969-1975 Miles' would make albums of varying quality, some of which worked and others which didn't. However, some jazz critics then and now accused Miles of selling out. They wanted him to continue playing show tunes and to use acoustic instruments.<br /><br />Mark Isham recorded an album in 1999 called Miles Remembered: The Silent Way Project. Isham recorded versions two of the three tracks on this album \\"In a Silent Way\\" and \\"It's About Time.\\" His versions are worth hearing.d to use acoustic instruments.

0131177052|3.0|This was recommended to me by others and part of a great series of books. This has some great advice for solving specific problems, but it's not a book you just pick up and read. More for referencing when you are stuck refactoring a brown field code base.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|If you are looking for many pages of in depth details on an NDE, this may not be the book for you.  The author certainly explains, and in some detail, his experiences, however much of the book is dedicated to the circumstances surrounding the experience and how it caused a drastic shift in his spiritual beliefs.  For people who doubt the validity of NDE's, this is a good book for you due to the atheistic outlook of the author in the beginning, and the medical facts backing up his experience.  It's a good, quick read.

I don't see myself ever needing to implement these concepts from scratch, instead I will use existing frameworks that have already solved these problems.<br /><br />The benefit of reading this book is understanding what the problem is, why it's a problem and how to solve the problem. With this knowledge it's much easier to utilize frameworks associated with the patterns and concepts.

In fact there weren't that many. The car chase was good, but it felt like that was suppose to be the climax of the film. They left it open to continue the series. Hopefully they can restore the series, but as it's own movie I kept waiting for it to start.

However, this is not a reason why I wouldn't buy it again because this dinosaur will be involved with a lot of imaginary dinosaur play and this will be perfect for that.

B007SGM084|1.0|Okay.  So...  I understand that this was sort of a 'breakout' book for the 'S&M housewives' out there.  But really, the writing was just terrible.  First of all it's called a vagina.  Learn it, if you have to constantly refer to it as 'down there' you shouldn't be writing a pseudo-erotic novel.  Second of all...  no woman in the world gets off that easily and that many times.  And if they do, it's a woman who is VERY familiar with her body and not someone who has never touched her clit in her entire life.<br /><br />Now lets go one to other issues.  Like... when she talks about how he looks at her, touches her, makes some sort of gesture to her and she states she's turned on.  Okay.  All well and good.  We've all been there.  But then he will say something, usually a single word and all the sudden her response is 'how can he turn me on with just a word.'  I'm sorry...  Did you not read three lines earlier where you were already turned on?  Or am I just crazy.  I mean... I'm crazy but holy smokes for being someone who is so brilliant she's awfully dense about her body.  We go back to the first paragraph, she's never even looked at herself in a mirror.<br /><br />Lastly, I have to agree with a few of the other reviews here.  For being a billionaire he really spends no time working.  Just yelling in his phone a lot to 'get it done'.  Maybe he's a classier Larry the Cable Guy?<br /><br />I know books are a reach into the imagination.  But this book was just poorly written, the fantasies were not really that erotic in my opinion.  And the story that the nerdy girl gets the super hot, extremely rich, overly giving clit commander is just too much.

B0095R76EW|4.0|Overall The Five-Year Engagement is a very good movie. It's very funny and both the plot and character development are very well done. There are only two very minor reasons it lost one star from me. First, there are some parts that seem to drag a little long which breaks the pacing at times. Second, it seems to me that there is one to many uses of &#34;jump cuts&#34; for my taste. Neither of these issues takes away from the movie overall, but it does keep it from getting that 5th star from me.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones are such great actors, and in this movie, they play so well together. Meryl Streep plays Kay and Tommy Lee Jones plays Arnold, her husband. They're a middle-aged couple who have been married for thirty years, but for the last five years have slept in separate bedrooms and haven't made love during this time.Kay is very unhappy about the situation and wants it to change, so she browses through a bookstore and finds a book written by Dr. Feld, played by Steve Carell (who is great in this movie, not over the top like he sometimes can be), about restoring marriage and enjoying being in a good relationship. So Kay books them on a week long retreat run by Dr. Feld. The movie is touching and funny, it's a movie for women and men. It will be thoroughly enjoyed by married couples. The supporting characters are great as well especially Jean Smart who plays, Eileen, Kay's best friend and Elizabeth Shue who plays Karen the Bartender. It is hilarious when Kay is in the bar because she and Arnold just had words and she spills that she and Arnold haven't had sex in five years; Karen's response is wonderful and funny!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book which describes the life and times of a Navy SEAL who was a critical member of the mission to get UBL. Keeps you on the edge of your seat from cover to cover. Not too dramatic, well written and organized. Some have stated that classified information was revealed in the book, however I did not see anything written that I had not already seen in the papers. In fact the author footnotes all of his references describing the unclassified original source of every nugget. Highly recommended for anyone interested in reading about what took place behind the scenes in one of the greatest manhunts in history.

It is amazing how much we were able to accomplish before the giant web of bureaucracy took over our process. I am not sure we can or will ever get back to this level of capability - great thinkers and engineers who really had the safety and security of our nation in mind and did everything they could to develop the systems needed to keep our nation safe. Today it takes way too long and costs way too much money to field equivalent systems. This book captures some of the greatest times and efforts in our country's history. Definite must read for anyone affiliated with weapon system acquisition processes.

1118156307|5.0|This book is an amalgamation of thinking about service design from 15 of Europe's best designers.  Service design as a cross-disciplinary design form is more advanced in Europe where it's been defined as a separate discipline for more than 25 years.  now as &#34;designing thinking&#34; hits the US, &#34;service design comes along with that group of ideas.  But this book lays otu clearly and simply the customer-empathetic framework for service design projects, as well as the principles of the discipline.  Then the book explains more than 30+ tools that can be used in service design projects.  When it comes to design thinking I think if you're only buying one book, this is the book. Outstanding!
034580404X|5.0|I was an amazing price and came right when theyy said it would. I am sure my daughter will love reading this amazing series of books.
B000T433CO|4.0|Would recommend to older teens and adults of all ages. On my &#34;must watch&#34; December list. All star line up with lots of chemistry.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|The self play lines out how to do the game and the game has different levels so I was able to ease into it.  As you move up the levels you get solid challenges to your ability to do the hand - eye.  I have no talent but it was fun to feel I could do something on the piano.  I recommend it.
B008NW67E0|5.0|when you play this record, it makes you feel good, the energy comes from the grooves! Abrilliant album after the first one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very comparable to 50 shades but it's a good book and was a easy read.  I was able to complete the book very easily and am excited to see how she ends the series.
B0074JODP8|5.0|what a performance, surely he is a top guitarist and yet so young! The whole band is tributng on this DVD, for he coeuld not do it aloone. If you like blues, than you must have it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My wifely and motherly duties slacked a lot!!!!  I couldn't put this book down.  I started skimming the sex scenes, they are all the same anyway, and really reading the story.  I didn't sleep, I hardly ate, laundry didn't get done.  I loved this book.
B008N2Z1L0|4.0|Jakob did a good job in making this album. It is really a Jakob Dylan album. And that is what we all like!
B0063GORYU|3.0|I downloaded it just to have a new app and I like that its a fun game to play just to pass the time
B008EZVNO0|3.0|Van has not the good lyrics on this album, the music is verry good, but a lot of lyrics is a little hasty scribbeled down. It is like he has nothing to say.
B00846REIS|4.0|I read 50 Shades Series first, so this series to me seems like a knock off.  The first book is good, the second is better and we are all waiting on the third. Most of the &#34;erotic romance&#34; books that I have read lately all seem to follow a similiar story line and all seem to end in the same manner.  It's getting a little boring.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|John is al those years a star in Netherlands, before the amaricans discovered him, I follow his musuc for years and every album is a good one, so is this. Keep on writing John!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|My husband enjoyed this book very much.  There was some humor in the book which he shared with me.  I didn't understand some since I was never in the military but I get the gist
B009VSW15Y|2.0|camera only faces the reader rather difficult to take a pic of anything but the reader. camera should face the oppisite direction or better yet both directions
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The story grabs you from the beginning and I found it hard to put down.  Patricia is one of my favorite authors.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Fairly good books and easy to read.  Even though it's not the most action packed the author still keeps my interest with quality story telling.  Not quite where my interest lies though.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|The problem with Ted is it tries to have a balance of gratuitous with typical Hollywood formulaic moral resolutions, when it should have just stayed on the side of raunchy and giving its target audience what it wants, family guy with no censorship, instead we got a boring typical Hollywood cookie cutter piece of crap with a few sprinkles of the dirty gratuitous pure fun we were hoping for.
B000W93CHC|4.0|The characters are involving and readers learn a lot about life in the fourteenth century.  Engaging and entertaining, if long.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This man is very funny. His main character keeps you laughing throughout the book. Unfortunatey, I found the situation a little difficult to believe. Everything moved along well though and I liked the book.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|This is one of the few remakes that's better than the original.  Fun movie. Decent acting, makes me want to go out and drive a mini-Cooper.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|Have really enjoyed all of this series.  As soon as i read one I get the next.  Good stories thats hard to put down.
B000T433CO|5.0|This move is full of all kinds of emotions and issues but still makes you feel good.  Well worth watching!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Still going strong, and a great counter to too many reality shows corrupting tv.  This show is just as good as Friends.
1596912375|5.0|A novel where one could not figure out the ending ahead of time  which kept me guessing.  This is a rare ocassion.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read this in two days. Buy this book and I promise you won't regret it. I normally don't like action books but it was amazing.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I thought the book related to an important event in history - the riots and was very plausible.  It kept me interested,
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it!! its fun to play Solitaire when I am not reading.  I enjoy mindless entertainment as a break between books.
B0011EU0NG|1.0|The DVD shown is not the DVD I Received! I am so disappointed that I have not opened or given as the gift I had planned.the only reason I am giving it 1 star is to be able to post.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I was surprised when I saw the second film that they really tied the two together nicely. Soundtrack is great on the second one too (and reconfigured). For any nerd out there, this is a must see!
B009IF8CH6|4.0|The Big Bang Theory makes fun of science.  In doing so, I believe it motivates minds to find out what the humor is about.  Like myself, many who are motivated to look, will not gain an IQ like Dr. Sheldon Cooper, but will at least learn something they did not know.  Something they saw no reason to know.  Yet after learning it, will retain it in the brain for the next time it is used on the show.  (Awakening a yearning for knowledge using comedy is a good idea.)  While looking for the science that makes a joke funny when spoken in (as Penny calls it) jibber jabber, the opening of books or online encylopedias or online science references, the seeker learns things.  To some extent it is an educational program with a comedy twist.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great for passing the time away and using brain skills.  Not boring at all.  Glad I downloaded it. wonderful !!!
B001L83PLQ|5.0|So loved this book, very historical. A love story in so many dimensions. I can not  wait for the movie!
B008MX7Z32|4.0|It is a little large to carry around, but I wanted an emergency task light that could be charged through my computer.  This one works perfectly so far. Its large size is the only reason I only gave it 4 stars, otherwise it would have been a 5.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas CD's. Listen to it EVERY DAY at work. Even bought it for a friend as a Christmas gift.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|This app is very easy to setup on your phone.  Just a simple download and folder choosing, then bam! you can sync your pictures from your phone to your PC or vice versa.  Yes there are many other apps that provide free storage, but I trust Amazon with my personal information.  Even if other companies have good reputations you never really know who is viewing what.  I've been buying on Amazon for years and never has my info. been compromised.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Despite the fact that their are alot of far fetched plot lines in this movie, i naturally laughed! so theres a win!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great action movie!  Fighting scenes were awesome!  Robert Downey, Jr. had some great lines, very funny, good actor.  Quality of the movie on streaming was very good.
B00138KEZ4|5.0|I can't speak for Sarah's other albums bit I find this one really impressive.  Sarah's obviously a musician, in contrast to most of the other popular recording &#34;artists.&#34;  Real artistry in singing and production.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|A bit confusing at times, but if you're really intuitive you'll get it on the first shot. If not, then eventually you will figure it out (like me). Awesome story line, and really thought provoking in general. I'd watch it again and again :)
B000EUDAWG|3.0|I got one of these elsewhere for my son and I have to say that I am not that impressed. It doesn't work particularly well and I have noticed little hairsmy falling out all over my floor. Although my son did spend some time playing with it, the novelty wore off pretty quickly because he couldn't control it. OK at best.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The gratis r Cary nice  but when is shera going 2 to come in cuz I can't wait for her to come in
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Just read this book, it is not a crime novel but it has crimes, not a mystery but it has mysteries, not a coming of age saga but it treads in that territory, not a family drama but the whole theme is a family melodrama. It meshes all these genres  almost seamlessly.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This series ROCKS! I like it even better than the first season.. (The first season rocks too)<br />Brilliant performances by all. (Isn't Ian McShane the best Santa ever?)
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|I haven't had the chance to play enough with it, but what I have seen so far is good. My only complaint is that sometimes I can't access my laptop.
B002APU580|5.0|Imagine a world where the only concern is getting your children married.  This a visually beautifu filml with with great acting.  Donald Sutherland is wonderful in a supporting role.  I watched on a cross country flight and the time flew by.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|I bought this for my son's birthday since he's into Minecraft. We paid out the gazoo because I couldn't find it anywhere other than Amazon. The set was cute and all, and he enjoyed putting it together, but it is TEENY TINY.
2061011306|5.0|The Michelin maps are the best, most well-detailed maps, for the best price ever.<br />They have the best quality for framing, and provide a great map for either reference or teaching.<br />Great map at a good value,..as always.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never thought I would watch or like a zombie show...Walking Dead is a thriller...looking forward to more of this show
B002RXZF6C|5.0|Frankenstein<br />A most entertaining movie! For me, since first viewing as a kid, this 1931 version of Frankenstein maintains an allure, not scary anymore but so entertaining. I love Edward Van Sloan's characterization (same as in all his other movies) of the learned, sage, precise authority on all things evil! He moves to rectify what is pernicious, insidious, unwelcome and unwholesome in this world.......<br />Colin Clive and Boris Karloff are wonderful to behold in their roles......<br />This is a move that is truly classic!
B0079R8KXG|4.0|The cover is comfortable to hold, is made well and of good materials.  I expect it to last through much use.  I'd buy it again.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I loved the way we got aquainted with the characters from childhood through young adult hood.  For a few days I had a wonderful group of interesting friends and we grew up together. LOL
0307895475|5.0|LOVED IT! Couldn't wait for Christmas to open. Received before the shipping dates. Fast shipping! Would order again. Daughter and I could not wait to read it and have already started.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved this book. Having been a young child in WW2 I sort of concider that my era. I never tire of reading good stories about that time.
B007SGM084|1.0|The writing is completely horrible and I know that most people will say it's not about the writing but the story. Well the story is pretty terrible also.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I wanted it to last forever.  I am looking forward to more books. What an amazing author to be able to write these stories.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Anyone who says bad things about this game hasn't actually PLAYED!  This is such a great game.  Cant put it down.  Game is totally free. yes you need patience but you make tons of friends and keep creating your very own beautiful islands of dragons!<br /><br />Please please please TEAMLAVA! Get the Kindle Fire update done!!!!!  Will not purchase again until that happens!  I want all the great new stuff NOW!! lol<br /><br />Thank you for making such an awesome game for us!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Just doesn't show up like my computer......a little disappointed for sure. It only shows certain things and I can't figure out how to scroll down for more.......
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|This movie was very &#34;real&#34;.  Love Meryl Streep!!  The story line was very relatable.  I laughed and a I cried over their struggles and frustrations. Very good movie.
B000T433CO|5.0|This movie should be on everyone's must see list - funny, heart-warming and of course the love stories. Love the cast and the story. Highly recommended.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|This is a very funny movie if you have an open mind!  I got quite a few laughs out of it and definitely one of the best comedies out there.
B000002U9L|5.0|I love this music so much and the movie is so awesome i love listening to the music and watching the movie
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|tried to squeeze my review into the subject line, but i left out the part where the game is slow, tedious, and boring.
B0095R64AO|2.0|Had it's funny parts, but overall, not a very good movie.Maybe for a younger generation? Not sure, but this movie would have been better with a glass of wine, a drink or two, or a few beers. Okay, more than a few...
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I'm a professional musician with a deep connection to the guitar. The best part? So are the three guys here. Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Jack White from the White Stripes, and The Edge from U2 share many stories from their time as musicians and describe what it was like to discover the guitar as their &#34;calling&#34; in music. A great movie for any real musician, guitarist or not.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I rented this movie via Amazon Prime on a Roku device.  I was pleased with the process, with the streaming, and with the movie.  I will do more streaming via Amazon Prime.  Having the many titles available out there is a neat feature of Amazon Prime membership.
B002WTOXUK|5.0|I love this movie. It's one of the best I've ever seen. A very interesting story idea, and it's executed wonderfully. I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of swearing and blood.
0425264351|5.0|I really enjoyed the fast pace and no nonsense guy Jack Reach is.  Had to read this first book before seeing the movie, which is based on One Shot.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|Pros:<br />Fun remake and is good entertainment for short periods of time.  Great for a phone game.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It requires a network connection after EVERY game.  If you try to play this with poor network connections be prepared to force close.  The game will lock up my phone until it is able to send my score to the high score gods.  If it can't connect and I do not do a force close it quickly drains the battery of my Attrix 4G.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I uninstalled it.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|There are a couple of great songs (Spectrum, Only for a night), but some of the others aren't of the same caliber.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This is surprisingly funny despite its leaning on seemingly sophomoric humor bites.  I loved the movie and was entertained throughout its entirety.  There is certainly a lot more thought and sophistication to this movie than to call it sophomoric humor.  Seth McFarlane is a comedy genius.  The movie had all of the Family Guy type humor that I also like and it added its own level of humor pertinent to making the story line interesting if not oddly believable.  Oh, and what need I say about Mila Kunis....worth the dime just to see her even if the volume was off.  My girlfriend also tolerated the suggestion of watching the movie knowing that Mark Wahlberg was in it.  Yes, the would you please put on a shirt guy.  He was great and the girlfriend loved the movie too.
B008HI7BMW|5.0|The DKR soundtrack combines the previous two movies scores and adds additional themes for characters like Bane and Selina Kyle.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really like this series better...Better plot and the steamy scenes don't feel cut and pasted over and over. I would recommend this to anyone of my friends!
B008E374PO|5.0|If you're an Owl City fan, things only get better with this new CD. It's really fun, has some great songs, Good Time, I'm coming after You, Shooting Star, and Metropolis.
B004M8S3Y6|3.0|Interesting, well written with humor that is refreshing when you are trying to loose weight. Need more time to be compliant and to see results. Worth a TTY!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I love the movie, the DVD/Blu-Ray is great, but the UV program is terrible, just go back to a free digital copy!
B001AFF25W|5.0|this is an easy to read easy to follow personal development book<br />I truly recommend it<br />if you follow the steps you will succeed
B009O07NDY|5.0|A great mix of similar themes from the Lord of the Rings, but with it's own feel, the soundtrack is great.
B001KZG99A|3.0|Iron Man is a great flick--at least worth a four star rating.<br />But in buying the DVD, we also got the Video on Demand. The playback quality was spotty--it stall several times, searching for signal. The computer that it was playing on was not running any other programs to eat up processing time, and the wireless router is the fastest that Verizon sells. This could just have been an aberration, but I am not likely to pay for any Video on Demand based on the experience.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not a fan of the violence in this book but good finale to the trio. Could have had as much suspense without the Gore.  Not looking forward to Hollywood adding to our culture of violence when they (if they) make a movie. Wish we could tone down the violence by a lot - but that takes writing skills.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|It was a very fast paced, action packed movie with all the stars I grew up with!  I was not dissappointed.
B002BWP49C|5.0|It was in great conditions and it came very fast even a while month before Christmas.<br />Very pleased with it.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|This is a western set in the distant future.  The acting is okay.  There are no aliens.  The good guys are outlaws forced into that position by a &#34;bad&#34; government that they did not want to join.  The plot is not original, but plausible.  Nothing is original, but I still liked it.  I like westerns and I like science fiction, books or movies doesn't matter to me.  I like underdogs.  It is a clean series with no shocking, graphic scenes to warp kids (that I can remember).  There is occasional blood and violence.  The series is not rated.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Does this movie really need a review? It's an awesome movie, that's all you need to know, if you haven't seen it, you better be a young kid, other wide shame on you
B001OGWY1W|3.0|I heard so much about this series, so maybe my expectations were too high.  The batman character seems so flat and, yes, I know he is a comic book character.  Also, I felt the actor's choice for Batman's voice was too distracting. The visual effects and design were quite well done and enjoyable to watch, however.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|The kids loved it and wanted le to buy it so they could watch and rewatch. A Christmas winner. Funny and entertaining for the whole family.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I enjoyed my time with this little game. I could pinch and zoom just fine on my little Samsung smartphone. classic hidden object gameplay with added challenges like flashlight, memory and jigsaw puzzles. The static character portraits between stages got boring and i was expecting a twist or surprise during the very linear story. Also the same objects were in every room. On the whole it was well done and left me hungry for more!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the book I finished it in not even a whole day!!!!!!!!!! It was a awesome book well I'm 10 so I like the series.
1451695195|5.0|This is an excelent book. I would reccommend it to everyone. It gives one a lot to think about. Dying does not have to be scary.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I've have been a fan of the movie and finally decided to own it. It arrived right on time and in perfect condition. Because I'm not home most of the day I was not able to sign for the package when it first arrived and so it was left at my door. Even so the delivery person was nice enough to hide it under the door mat so it wouldn't be bothered. I'm a super satisfied costumer.
1878424319|2.0|I found this book to be a mixed bag.  Two stars because even in a mixed bag, there is wisdom to be found.  But you really already have to have wisdom, to be able to decide where it is in this book.  Otherwise it can set you on a dangerously simplistic path -- a 'how to' manual, so to speak, on learning how to wash your hands of it all.    I have to admit the first warning sign came in the introduction of the book, where in the first paragraph Ruiz thanks and acknowledges his parents, grandparents, and sons; A nice thing to do, but oddly makes no mention of his sons' mother.  It's possible her name is listed vaguely somewhere else, but why no direct acknowledgement with family?  Divorce, broken relationship?  See, I'm making assumptions.  But to me the exclusion is a glaring one, consciously done, and doesn't forebode well for the author's ability to dispense spiritual advice that will be unbiased, well-intentioned, and for the good of all.    And unfortunately, instead of dispelling my concerns, the author tends to write from a 'jilted lover' standpoint.  Yes, this book can help those who have been hurt or victimized, and to deal with the negative effects of being hurt, but it can also be used to vindicate those who have done the hurting.  And even more so, this book can vindicate those who perceive themselves to be victims.  A 'get out of jail free card', for the guilt and pain; no need for self-analysis.    The four basic agreements are wonderful advice; the inside cover of the book is really where they are summed up and can be appreciated.  Like other reviewers have said, I had a problem with the explanations and examples that the author uses to illuminate them.  This is where the book assumes no gray areas in life; the four agreements are ironclad.  Sorry, no, it's not that simple.  There are gray areas and we need to know, ie, learn, how to apply the four agreements.  Perhaps there should be a fifth agreement:  Try to grow in wisdom every single day.    For example, the author makes much of the power our words have to cut others down, and lower their self-esteem, and he warns to also not let others create our own self-image.  Well and good, but what about those whose low self-esteem is not caused by what others say, but think it is?  I know people who have read this book and consider it confirmation of the blame they place on whoever they feel has caused their self-loathing.  When in reality, their low self-esteem can be caused by what they don't hear and what their egos need to hear.    He uses many examples that are based on the relationship between two lovers, and many are cringe-worthy in their simplicity. He talks, negatively of course, about spouses who make assumptions about what marriage should be, and spouses who try to change their spouse.  Well, I assumed my husband would be home at 4 am on Friday night, not out at a bar, and I'm disappointed that he's not.  Is that a completely unfair disappointment?  Ok, I've read the book and now I know that it was wrong to make assumptions; should I clearly communicate my expectations of marriage to him or should I just not take it personally and carry on, Vulcan style?  Should he tell me that I shouldn't try to change him, or that my hurt is not his concern?    The book makes no suggestion to try to understand where others are coming from. There is no need to, because any hurt that others feel is a result of their own perception, not our doing. Yes, to a certain extent, but what if we are truly being cruel? Here again, it doesn't matter on the flip side either, because my cruelty should not be taken personally by you.  Circular logic.    This book can be a wonderful pep talk and launchpad, but you the reader will have to do most of the work.  Not just trying to live by the four agreements, but understanding how to apply black-and-white rules to the gray human world. Do not make the mistake of using this book as a substitute for your own thought process, because it is woefully lacking in that regard.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This movie starts off with a bang and increases the action from there. Every actor who has played an action hero in the last 35 years is in this movie and it is more an old reunion than anything else.  It is a lot of gunplay, canons, missiles and bombs. There are a lot of good one liner jokes in this movie and you will smile and laugh when you hear them.  Against such a cast the bad guys never really had a chance!<br /><br />This film has so much action it is like a comic book action story put to film.  If you like action movies then this is one you have to see.  If you don't care for shoot-em up action movies with a lot of violence then this is not your style of movie.  It is not a top notch movie but with the continuous action and great cast I had to give it five stars.
098478280X|5.0|Interviewees, a must read to start with.<br />Interviewers, please find your questions else where. I've heard a candidate at a facebook interview exhausted the interviewers' questions with some before-hand study.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|It is only under extreme circumstances that I will pay this amount to 'buy' the movie.  It would have been an instant sell as a 'rent' movie and would have appealed to a broader band of customers.  Personally, I'll stop using Amazon movies if they continue to only offer 'buy' options.<br />If it was a 'rent' movie, I would have given it 5 stars.  Who doesn't love a Bourne movie (except, of course, my wife)?
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I first have to say, There MAY be some spoilers in here if you haven't read the book yet so be warned. Now let me say I did really enjoy reading this book. I'm 50 and thought at times \\"this is definitely for a young audience\\", but I knew that going in so I am not criticizing that, just saying it is definitely for teenagers more than for YA. I don't understand why everyone is upset with Travis. He is a hound dog and never pretended to be anything else - Ladies if we don't lie down with hound dogs, we won't get Fleas!  Stop being surprised when they use you!  I loved how he was brought to his knees by Abby. Every hound dog deserves an Abby! MY biggest issues were with Abby. Her fickle crap about 2/3 of the way thru drove me NUTS. \\"oh geeze, he loves money more than me, just like daddy...\\" Really? He was doing, or going to do those things FOR you. If you really really didn't want him to - give him an ultimatum. Don't just leave when he pushes. A mature person sits down and discusses their concerns and issues, she doesn't expect him to read her mind! I honestly think that is what bothers me most about these books. They encourage young women to expect men to 'just know' what they are thinking and needing. Having said all of that, the writing was done well and I was on the edge of my seat wanting them to get together. I related well with the relationship and identified it with one of my early boyfriends. I don't know if there is a sequel, but I will read it if so.
B009X01D9U|5.0|I bought the orange color so no one at our house would ever confuse this for my wife's plain black tablet.  It just works.  You can rotate the case a full 180 degrees.  There are 2 handy tabs built into the side that fit into your choice of 3 indents in the cover so that you can angle the case to use the kindle as a standing reader on a table in either landscape or portrait position.  The vertical black sripe you see in the product picture is an elastic strap that functions to hold the case closed.  I have no complaints.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Addictive.  One of those shows that you say well this will never happen, but then you start watching and can't stop. Crazy good show with some really good plot and awesome actors.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun for the whole family - all ages. A little adictive - my started me on it... At first i thought it was silly but the challege just keeps you playing and playing
1401322786|5.0|The book is one that my book club is reading.  It came (a little later than I wanted) but in time for me to read it before the discussion.  The process was fine and seamless.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I my grandkids love it. It was easy to download to the gamepad and it instaled right away . Then just go on and play it is a very entertainning game. thank you Amazon
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Nice graphics, runs well on Android devices, but looks best on my Kindle Fire because of it's size.  My 9 yr old son loves this game.  Stable, no crashes yet.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is awesome! Just like the first book it kept me glued to it and I couldn't put it down! I can't wait for the 3rd book!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's a free calculator app.  Won't flip horizontal on my Kindle Fire, forcing me to hold it portrait.  Sounds stupid, but the graphic tile that represents the app is too generic, it gets lost in my app list when I'm looking for what should be the keys of a calculator. Update: The developer actually read the review and changed the app tile.  I think that's pretty good service! Now can you make it rotate?
1451627297|5.0|Engaging premise.  Thoughts are provoked.  The story is expansive, but moves along with enough pace to keep you hooked.  And, as always, the characters/characterization is top-notch.  Also, you have to love the shouts-out to other stories from the King world.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|It is just amazing. The characters are all very dynamic. The multiple story lines are something that really brings life to all the characters.
B00338QENI|5.0|this was an excellent read and a background about which I knew nothing. The author humanized this whole story and brought Henrietta back to life for us. Well done and very readable.
0440246008|5.0|Jack Reacher is my favorite anti-hero. Lee Child has created page turners which I can't put down. I am hooked.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|Another great album from Lady A ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another fabulous read by John Grisham complete with an unexpected outcome! A must read for any John Grisham fans! Loved it!
B0099116AY|5.0|This is a wonderful movie!! I love both Meryl and Tommy!1 Very good movie! Worth the money for sure!! Would buy again
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|My husband & I really enjoyed this movie. We both thought it was surprisingly hilarious! I would recommend this movie, especially if you enjoy the \\"Family Guy\\" type of comedy.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I would recommend A Feast for Crows: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Four, by RR Martin to everybody who has imagination! Those who love adventure and those who dislike abuse!<br />There is only one thing which I didn't like:  where is the next book of this collection?
B002RSQGQK|5.0|This is such a classic Hitchcock movie.  We enjoyed it and the special effects<br />of it's time.  Love the cameo Hitchcock sighting...very classic.  I recommend it.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I am a great fan of Lee Childs books and this one is up to his usual high standards,you do not want to put it down and<br />plenty of twiss in the tale, highly recommended.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|The writing and acting in this show is wonderful!!!!  Love all the characters and the chemistry on screen is very strong!!!!!
B00598XVA4|4.0|I love this album.  I got this on tape originally right after I got number of the beast and I was truly sold on Maiden.  The first 6 tracks in particular are awesome.  I love the main riff on track 9.  Only track 8 is kind of average.
B00632HWOG|1.0|ever since i updated this app my messages do not load at all. Not happy about this do something about it asap
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I thought the movie was entertaining and funny. I don't give 4 or 5 stars to anything that I don't truly love. I would watch it again if a date wanted to.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Downloaded quickly and easily. Works well to do basic word processing (haven't tried other features yet). Little bit of a learning curve with Kindle keyboard, but online help is easy and clear. To print on standard computer setup just email docs to yourself as attachments. Word, Wordperfect, and Open Office all opened sent docs OK.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I didn't think ken Follet could top his Pillars of the Earth trilogy but I think he will with his outstanding series which starts with WWI.  I didn't realize how much I didn't know about the start of WWII especially in the pacific arena.  Can't wait for the 3rd book to be published.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|Great movie however it would be nice if amazon had the outtakes and deleted scenes. Overall though great movie diffidently a movie to watch just without kids.
B008S4YZCO|2.0|Had been enjoying it until it suddenly wouldn't let me visit random neighbors anymore.  Then it made me start over... yet I couldn't do anything at all.  Not happy at all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is excellent! It has an exciting plotline with great characters.I ate up each page and even suggested it to my teenaged son. Check it out!
B005COO1X6|5.0|This is vintage King, odd and terrifying.  I could not wait to turn the page. It was a lt of fun and a great diversion.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Could not put it down and finished at 12: 30 in the morning. Highlt recommend to those who are in to Mitch Rapp and his exploits
B000OMF3K6|5.0|I loved this book. The dog Einstein was wonderful. I have never read a book anywhere as entertaining as this! Wish I had a dog like him!
B004LWZW42|4.0|The quality of movie was good and it was far better than wolverine but not as good as the first xmen worth a viewing
B009329ZF2|4.0|My gal and I watched Battleship and were entertained, which is the whole point of TV! I liked it and so did she. 4 stars.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I like the movie and the quality was just as described. very happy with the purchase. and my nephews love it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved loved loved this book. I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie and now I'm not sure I still want to see the movie. I have such a clear vision of the atmosphere, the mood that I think will be ruined by someone else's interpretation. On to book two!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Could not put it down! Great adventure and excitement. Makes me want to start hiking the PCT this summer. Awesome!
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This has been my favorite movie ever since I saw it in 1971. Soundtrack is second to none. The end.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I'm a DeMille fan and this is another great book from the master; John Corey jumps out of the pages full of wit and sarcasm.  Makes you want to have coffee with the dude.<br /><br />I'm a hard cover book guy and this is my first Kindle experience.  I'm hooked; it's compact, it reads great outdoors and it's so easy to purchase and download your books and I don't have to make more room on my bookshelf.  What took me so long?
B008NW67E0|5.0|i love mumford and sons, and this cd is great!!! shipping was super fast! recommend anyone to buy this cd, it wont be a dissapointment!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|All I can say is that I cried when she is packing to leave her husband.  Movies don't make me cry!!!!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|It is an amazing book, extremely well written.  I think the boy was born wrong, and the mother simply let him get away all the time.  She suffered but did no much to straighten him  I was realy surprised at the end. It¨s a master piece.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I'm already a big Men in Black fan. It's based on a comic book, Jones and Smith (or should that be Smith and Jones?) are excellent and excellent together, and the first two movies were just so much fun. Say what you want about the second; it was still a lot of fun, and I like it. So do my kids. Well, MiB3 did not disappoint.<br /><br />Smith and Jones were just as excellent as they always are, but it was Josh Brolin that really stole the show. He was amazing! He was as much Agent K as Tommy Lee Jones was. I mean, my kids thought it was some kind CGI magic and didn't realize that it was some other actor playing the character until we told them. That's some amazing stuff right there, and the movie is worth seeing just for his performance. Facial expressions, voice, everything.<br /><br />It was nice to see Emma Thompson in the movie, also, although I was disappointed by the lack of Rip Torn as Zed. Of course, there was also Will Arnett in a small but hilarious role. He's great in those kind of walk on parts. And there was Bill Hader who is also just SO funny, and just the fact that he was playing Andy Warhol was a laugh all by itself.<br /><br />On top of the great acting, the story was well done. The time travel stuff was handled well, and that's always an issue with any movie with time travel. And there was an emotional aspect to this one that was really lacking in the other two, and that was fabulous. It actually, literally, brought tears to my eyes, and, when a movie can bring tears to my eyes, well, that's saying something for the movie.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Men in Black 3, you should definitely take the time to do it. It's a movie I'll be purchasing at some point, because I already want to see it again.
B0063IH60K|3.0|In truth, I have not played this often enough to make an objective opinion.  Again, it whiles away the time.
B0098VXN2Y|1.0|Waste of time and money. Cameron Diaz needs to find better scripts and an acting coach!<br />I won't rent another of her movies again.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|Another gift to a friend who is a WW II buff and who greatly enjoyed this DVD. She had asked for it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love Harry Bosch and I admire his motto, &#34;They all count or nobody counts.&#34;  He doesn't give up on getting justice for anyone no matter how long it takes. Can't wait for the next installment.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is an amazing story, all the more credible since it is backed up by many others. Gives a more scientific look at the question of near death experiences.
0679436391|5.0|What more can I say, but I LOVE Dickens. I especially like his Christmas books, they are really short, and still life changing.<br /><br />I read somewhere that Dickens put out Christmas books, like he did all of his books, to make money, but especially around Christmas, he would write books that would bring in extra money for Christmas, so these Christmas books are written differently than his other books, where he was not paid by the word, or page, but for the book, in it's entirety. Hence, they are less wordy, not necessarily a good or bad thing, because Dickens wouldn't be any good without words.
B000002MG1|5.0|What can I say about REM?<br /><br />That´s just a great band, and this is a great album too. Looking foward to complete my REM collection, this one was at great price by the time I bought it.<br /><br />I just love it
B006AX6ONI|4.0|Good book of a collection of blog posts.  It could have been more detailed, but for $5 it is certainly a good quick read.
B007FTZDN8|1.0|I thought this would be an interesting app. I didn't find anything interesting though. Maybe I wasn't looking in the right place. ::shrugs::
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|The author has outlined and recollect the story very well from Adam childhood to Death. I have never been able to read the book and complete for a longtime but when I started this one I could not stop...at some stage I could not eat my lunch when I reached the battle leading to Adam's death. Its an excellent story told in a way that will inspire and touch everyone.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I hate having to harass friends for needed items. The game seems fun but once you get to a certain level, you need friends to send you things. What a pain.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was a great book.  Totallly unexpected.  I'm not into historical fiction but it was relevant to the story.  Would definitely recommend to friends.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We enjoyed season 2 even more than season 1 - this series is well worth the purchase. There are multiple storylines and lots of characters to keep it interesting. We watched the whole season in just a few days.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|What can I say. Serenity is the best movie ever. Joss Whedon and the cast are perfect. Summer Glau as River Tam .... just freaking awesome. The cast blends perfectly. Movies don't  get much better.
B005LAJ17M|1.0|Why did you send me two discs of disc 3? Come on meow, you can do better than that. Fap
B004UFEJS0|5.0|I give Ratatouille 5 stars. I think it's Pixars best movie. Not sure why but I can watch it over and over. Obviously this is marketed towards children but I think most adults would enjoy it too.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|loved the movie, it will keep you laughing, great movie for the family espicailly if you have kids in the family
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|Story line too muddied and flashbacks to the revelations are are inconsistent with earlier versions of the final Bourne story.
B0095R76EW|3.0|Not bad. Good twist. Not the usual chick flick. But, my boyfriend still felt it was a chick flick. I didn't feel that way. :) Loved that it was not the perfect, New York, double income couple...which as we all know is 90% of all Americans, right?
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|never laughed my ass off in my entire life. im not the one to laugh out loud. but on this movie i laughed my ass off.vary funny movie.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|one of my favorite 80's movies!  I think most highschool girls could relate to Andy.  Loved all three main characters!!
B00A3AU1U6|5.0|If you're looking for music with a tune or a beat this isn't it. This is sound as only Brian Eno seems capable of creating: beautiful, soothing, complex. I can listen to this for hours.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy is fantastic! Super fast reads, you can't put down. I even read them in carpool line, every second of safe stillness I was reading!<br />I worried they might be too over the top for my liking, romantically; however, the author never crossed my line if comfort!<br />She is a extremely talented writer & I passionately request her to give us more?!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Lately most of the romances I've read have just been terrible.  Finally characters I enjoyed in Conner and Megan.  Although the story isn't an original idea of waking up to a stranger.  But the road they take wasn't smooth so that made it feel original.  I am very critical and hard to please in a romance and this one I really enjoyed.  I will look for more by the author.
0525952926|4.0|I love Ken Follett books, but Winter of the World had a tendency to become confusing when he focused more on one character than the others.  Then when he returned to the others, it was hard to remember all the details about them. In general, very riveting and historically interesting.  He shouldn't wait too long to put out book III so that we don't forget the characters of book II and there will be new characters as well, at the same time, written too fast, it will be sloppy. The last book of the trilogy should be his best!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|I would recommend this to those, that liked the other Bourne episodes.<br />It is probably more FACT than fiction.<br />Makes one reflect on our current events.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved the first season, can't wait to see all of season 2, and hoping they make a 3rd season!!!!!!!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|A good movie overall. Pretty dark story, Charlize Theron is pretty creepy. The quality of this movie rental from amazon was pretty bad. It was very grainy and fuzzy at many parts. This is unusual however for amazon.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|The movie was not as funny as I thought it would be. Many of my friends enjoyed it, but it didn't do much for me. There were just a few parts that made me laugh.
B002BWP49C|4.0|I love this movie and couldn't wait to get it on DVD. I've been a fan of this saga well before the movies were made, and I love the movies!
B009FBX5M0|5.0|I have to say, I was sad when I heard that David Arnold was not returning to score Skyfall. However, Thomas Newman delivers a Bond score to be placed right up there amongst the best! He has blended the Bond theme into many of the action cuts and delivers a goose bump rendition of this theme at the reveal of the Aston Martin DB5 (track: Breadcrumbs). I have listened to this score dozens of times while driving, and I have to say to myself, &#34;slow down 007!&#34; :)
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading 50 Shades, I have been looking for something just as exciting, and this book is it! I love Gideon and Eva's story, and can't wait to find out what happens between them!
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Adele brings us Bond fans back to the days of Shirley Bassey and themes like Goldfinger and Diamonds are Forever in this wonderful opening number from Skyfall! I cannot play it enough!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read Bared to You so fast and loved it so much that I just couldn't wait to read the second part of Gideon and Eva's story! I'm itching to find out what happens in the last book, and I've already pre-ordered it!
B00633W614|4.0|I bought this book on a whim because of the summary...glad that I purchased this one.  Everytime I thought the worse was over something else would draw me into the story line...some parts of the reading was a bit wordy but I always wanted to keep reading to see what was going to happen next...good read if you commute as it will help pass time.
B0011E7JBW|5.0|Just introduced my 4, 9 and 10 year old boys to this series - they LOVED it :) We're watching the rest of the trilogy as a &#34;family&#34; evening movie :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My daughter had this app, and I watched her play.  I HAD to have it.<br />In three days I have blown through the first 8 levels.  It is way too much fun!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I loved this movie so much i bought it and have not opened it because i wanna keep it brand new.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This was great movie. I loved Meryl Stereo and Tommy Lee Jones.  It was great to watch it as instant video.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|Tim Burton at his best, this movie has a little of everything in t. Comedy, drama, horror, and action. Jack is the man..
B00992CF6W|5.0|Bought this on my kindle so my daughters would not fight over playing this game on the iPad. Works great and girls are able to playing on-line together now. No more bickering (at least over this game).
B005LAIIQC|3.0|But would not watch it a second time. I like Jeremy Renner, he was great in The Avengers as Hawkeye. Worth a rental not a buy!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|a suspense thriller all the way.<br />i have read many of clancy's books and thouroughly enjoy them.<br />will continue to look for his books
B009C5Z112|5.0|I love this group the music is amazing and the singing is genius. If you like melodic metal you should give them a try.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love the way Kathy puts her story together. Seemly unrelated events that all tie in together at the end. Keeps you guessing until the end. Great read!
B0087YPCYA|3.0|That is all this movie is about. The Piranha take back seat to the nudity here. If you want T & A then this is for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't read a book this quickly in a very long time! Great story and characters. I loved every minute of every page
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Kid Rock is back better than ever this CD rules. I have been listening to Kid Rock since the beinning. This CD is worth the money...
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I have always been a fan of strategy games ever since Dune 2 and Warcraft. This game is simple enough to be easily played on a tablet or phone, but still has enough of a twist to make it challenging.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a richly layered, many-textured story that kept me engrossed for hours.  The first book of the trilogy was great.  But if you haven't read it, don't worry.  You don't have to have read the first book to enjoy the second.  Can't wait for the third installment.
B0067R0APK|3.0|It's ok, works fine, and I just like the weather.com one better.  I wish though that one or both would carry air quality reports.
B002SYXCVK|3.0|Not really a big fan but this has some nice tracks. Sting does a good job with some unfamiliar titles.
0316228532|1.0|CASUAL VACANCY:  I returned this item. I did not like it. I found it boring and the readership too developed. †he  languarge ws too specific and too hard.
B00005JPSM|5.0|fast deliver, excellent price. will buy again. the movie was excellent I would recommend it to anyone in the food industry. beautiful light love store without the sex scenes
B0054JZC6E|5.0|.It is worth it . loved it. It had all I expected. All of you people are crazy f you don't like it
B000KJT8IG|5.0|this movie is by far one of the best Christmas movies ever. it is no doubt in the top 5 on everybody's list. and bluray makes it that much better.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I understand that this IS a free version, therefore a certain amount of advertisements are to be expected. However, the 15 seconds of actual gameplay followed by at least a 15 second long commercial,EVERY FIFTEEN SECONDS, IS completely uncalled for. I hope this review reaches the creators, for this simple message needs to be brought to light. Do you really think I want to buy your game after being repeatedly BOMBARDED with VIDEO ADVERTISEMENTS EVERY 15 SECONDS??? The entire situation screams &quot; money hungry&quot;, or better yet &quot; who cares about the customer?&quot; I HIGHLY doubt that's the message you want to send out when introducing a new game to the loyal &quot;angry birds&quot; fan base. I hope I'm not alone in being sick and tired of the companies I have grown to love trying to squeeze EVERY penny out of my wallet to do something that should be mandatory in the first place. Customer Service. Ever heard of it?
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very realistic novel.  Sort of like what would happen if we actually had a zombie apocalypse.  Really well written. The movie is in no way going to be able to compare.
B00ADQPA38|5.0|Finally some horror with an attitude. Not your typical horror with 5 teenagers and a serial murder. The story is very complex with twists and turns. And Jessica Lange is beyond amazing. Can't wait to see what season three has in store.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Just what I needed to download files to my Kindle.  Now all that I have to do is try to understand how to make it all work together?\!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A Reacher classic. Every Jack fan will enjoy hearing how the good guys get things done. No fuss, no muss, just results.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! The story kept me wanting to know what woild happen next and I didn't guess the end which is the biggest problem I have when reading.
B0049J0CTM|1.0|the story was constantly fear based with too many scary scenes for little kids. do we really need the adult humor woven in?
B000GL1BHO|3.0|My son may only be about to turn 3, but he knows his dinosaurs. He is autistic, and as a result is really obsessed with them and all of the little details. He was given this as a gift, and he does like it. But he pointed out to me that it has teeth. And the Pteranodon had no teeth. I googled it, and it turns out that he is right. No teeth. This little bugger has tons of them. So then we figured out that the pterodactyl did in fact have teeth, and decided it was easier to fib to him and say \\"This is actually a pterodactyl, sweetie!\\". That he believed.<br /><br />However, we know that the company intended for it to be a Pteranodon. It would be better for them to research these sorts of details first. With shows our son loves like Dinosaur Train and Dino Dan, it's easy for the kids these toys go to to be disappointed by such inconsistencies.<br /><br />Otherwise it is a very nice toy. Small and inaccurate, but nice.
0316069434|5.0|I am an avid and voracious reader. I can't get enough of good fiction and mystery novels.<br /><br />I've read all the big names (Connelly, Child, Grisham, Crais, Kellerman, Cornwell, Baldacci, etc.)<br /><br />Sadly, I've noticed that with every great series, it begins losing steam after a certain amount of time. For some, it is quite early, others rather late. I've been keeping my fingers crossed hoping this doesn't happen with Michael Connelly. With each new book of his, I am nervous and anxious when I am ready to begin it, for fear that it will not live up to the hype and to his earlier work.<br /><br />I am always surprised and rewarded. Michael Connelly is one unfathomable storyteller. I cannot name a single book of his that disappointed me. With this new installation in the Harry Bosch series, I am still left empty handed in the disappointment department. This was a wonderful book. I read it in only two sittings.<br /><br />I think the reason that his books are so great is because he does a wonderful job with the characterization of his characters. I feel like I know them because he describes them so vividly and adds such detail (for example, Harry's love of jazz, craving for cigarettes, etc.) More than any other author, Connelly has the ability to project you right into the mind of his characters and bring them to life.<br /><br />Consequentially, I find myself drawn to Harry Bosch. I feel as if I know the man. This is the definition of a good author.<br /><br />My only complaint about the book is that it was a bit tedious at certain points, but the action packed and suspenseful ending makes such a complaint unworthy of mention (though I added it in here for those who may care to know).<br /><br />Read this book. You won't be disappointed.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Slow moving - predictable - even the mens great bodies couldn't save this one -don't waste your time and money
0385344333|2.0|This book wasn't what I expected. I expected it to be better.<br /><br />Lee Child's books have always been amazingly entertaining and I am sure that Jack Reacher is one of the greatest modern heroes. Which is why I was disappointed with this novel.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; it still has action, still has funny, witty Reacher and is still a \\"good story\\". But in comparison with Child's other books, it doesn't stand a chance.<br /><br />The most frustrating aspect to me was that it seemed like I had read this book before. Nothing new. It didn't add to Reacher's character, it didn't reveal anything new, it didn't venture down any new paths nor introduce anything. It felt like Lee Child reached back into many of his older books and picked certain aspects from each one and threw them together to make this book. The results weren't good.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it is still a pretty decent book with the action that Reacher fans surely crave. But in terms of it being a great book or one you should look forward to, it isn't.<br /><br />Nothing more than something to do on a dull night.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing the PBS showing of the recording with all the artists and Tony.  Was so impressed, I wanted the CD.  Highly recommend.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I got the word about this game from my family  I really love playing with family and friends.  The sounds let me know when someone has played.  Strive for the 5 of a kind... shhhhh... cant say the Y word!  Have fun. You will love it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is an excellent casual time killer. I have enjoyed it very much and here are some more words.
B009NOVCSS|5.0|This five disc version (plus a vinyl EP) is the biggest Stones box ever. It has more songs from the Brian Jones '60s period than Hot Rocks and More Hot Rocks combined, though not quite as many as Singles London Years box. The main things missing are some Mick Taylor period stuff from the 1970's-- his three great epics, Monkey Man, Can't You Hear Me Knocking, and Fingerprint File; then Dancing With Mr D, one of my personal favorites; rarities like Everything is Turning to Gold, and of course why is Hot Stuff missing? But it has all the essentials from the '60s, the 80's and 90's and on up to now. The box is too big and unhandy, but you can switch out the five discs and put them into the three disc version, as there are four slots in there if you use the booklet pocket for disc one. If that matters to you, you will figure it out.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I enjoy it very much.My daughter lives 2 mi away and sends me pictures of my bee grand son.I store them on my kindle and love having it.I have purchased 3 kindles and love them All And I love amazon I am a little disabled so the mall is out.All my shopping is done on amazon.I have shared my delight to many more Thanks
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run my friends and I always compete to see whocan get the highest score I love this game
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I love Seth McFarlane, and although this movie was very entertaining and very funny, it's really not for younger audiences under 18 - and some over 18. Despite the teddy bear (Seth McFarlane) main character, it is a very adult movie with lots of explicit adult language and situations. I also LOVED Giovanni Ribisi as the Tiffany singer-Ted-obsessed outcast. I give it five stars because it's so original and so entertaining and I would definitely suggest this movie to all my adult friends.
B002TWWOHE|5.0|I can't believe I'm just discovering this show that debuted in 2009, because I watch USA shows.  But now that I've found it (thanks to my trusty Kindle Fire), I am completely hooked.  I'm not gonna lie, Matt Bomer is the primary reason I watch; he could be speaking in French, and it wouldn't make a bit of difference!  But I really like the plots of the episodes I have watched so far; it's intriquing and exciting, and did I mention the way Matt Bomer looks?  It's my weekend guilty pleasure to watch the show, I'm almost finished with Season 1, and can't wait to purchase the other three seasons!
B00APUTZYC|4.0|This show ended right before it jumped the shark, IMO.  When all the characters were in high school, all the scheming and conniving seemed very slick and somehow mature.  It fit in with the characters.  It even worked when they were all in their first years of college, but then it just got old.  I'm all for the willing suspension of disbelief, but I find it hard to believe that out of a group of 5 super privileged children, not a one of them finished college, but they all managed to get amazing jobs.  Heck I found it a little hard to believe that any of them got into college, since they appeared to spend about 10 minutes a day in school.  The show had lost its mojo and found it again a little with the Blair and the Prince storyline, but then lost it pretty quick.<br /><br />However, the series finale was worth it.  And what a shocker the identity of gossip girl was.....I have to say it was something I never in a million years saw coming.  That alone was worth the $1.99 to watch the series finale.  Too many series finales leave everything open (Sopranos), or make it completely confusing (Lost) and that just feels wrong, the Gossip Girl series finale did a great job of wrapping it all up with a nice little bow and I loved it.  And they did something else I love, which was to sort of do an epilouge type thing where you get to catch up with the characters five years late.  I haven't seen that done often, but I do love it, especially in a show like this one.<br /><br />Goodbye Gossip Girl....you know I love you XOXO ;)
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Perfect for the kid who isn't ready for grown-up movies but beyong animation. Funny with a good story line. Also a movie mom and dad dont mind sitting through!
B008VBYN80|4.0|Kingdom and Lords is good game to pass the time. There is a lot of personalization to your kingdom available. Good graphics. Easy gameplay.
B0073PZIYI|4.0|I'm beginning to like Justin Timberlake as an actor.  This story is a good fit for him.  I enjoy new creativity and ideas and all of the 'what ifs' we can explore about our humanity.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is very fun I played it for an hour an only stopped to eat lunch. So if I where you I would get this game.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|I love this movie.  Michael Cane just makes things better in a facilitator role.  In addition, I didn't 'get it'  the first time around.  But, I was  so fascinated with the storyline I had to view again and again to put all of the pieces together.  I couldn't get enough of it.!
1451648537|5.0|This biography is very emotional and inspirational to read for any one who's interested in the life and story of Steve Jobs. Although I don't know much about Jobs at all, I felt extremely emotional after read about Steve's life and the hard steps he had undergo to reach where he was. This book is truly an inspirational masterpiece.
B000Q76K24|3.0|I like Matt Damon movies.  But, this one moves slowly.  It was more intellectual than entertaining.  If Matt Damon or another superstar were'nt the primary character, it would be a bust for me.  Furthermore, I don't care to watch Angela Jolie nor Robert Diniro as secondarys.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Episode 1 is truly another masterpiece decades after the old Star Wars Trilogy. This is definitely one of the worse film compare to five other episodes, but still a film to enjoy. The special edition of the movie is great, which includes a special feature disc which shows how did they make the film. Definitely a great collector's item.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|It starts kind of slow, but I ended up loving it. By the end of the book you can tell that its history and religion is way more complicated than what it appears to be at first.
B0009MA8V0|5.0|American Idiot seems like a miracle of Green Day that popped out during an groundbreaking era of music. It is a true masterpiece that marks the new life of Green Day. All the songs are incomparable to their previous work, but this is the beginning of an entirely new band.<br /><br />This bundle pack includes the dvd of their live performance during the American Idiot tour. A great collector's item!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great story told by a great writer.  I have read almost all of Grisham's books, and this is at the top of the list.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a clever story and a pleasant read. I always appreciate the nuances of the legal system that Grisham is able to spin into a compelling tale.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|The most exciting thing about a new fantasy novel is the new world of magic I get to learn. I was skeptical of the ability of such a small story to teach a magic system with any true detail, but Sanderson delivered once again!
B004N8CP8K|1.0|All I can say is that it does not work well. It is difficult to use.  It was a waste of time to download.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is a lot of fun.  It has lots of different games, each one more challenging than the previous.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|All I have to say is that the book is AWESOME!!!!!!!!! x1,000<br />I LOVE THE BOOK IT IS GREAT FOR ME
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I love this movie and always has.  It's a classic movie like the Wizard of Oz.  Thank  you and Happy Holidays.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I absolutely loved Tim Ferriss' 4 Hour Body but couldn't get my husband to read it. He started reading this book and can't put it down! Hoping to get my 19 year old son to read it too! :)
B008F9E306|5.0|I could tell from the first track I was going to be obsessed with this album WELL into 2013, it has that appeal: the beats, the flow, the samples, the agression...its fine work of art.The first track got 3 repeats right of the bat! My last fav album from TI was KING. This tops it in every way.<br /><br />Most favorite tracks:<br /><br />1.) Trouble Man 10/10: Right out the box TI comes swinging w a sweet beat, dope lyrics and a nice voice over from Marvin Gay. Very well done.<br /><br />2.) Trap Back Jumping 10/10:  A well delivered, well measured, head bopping track w a nice agressive chorus.<br /><br />3.) Sorry 10/10:  I like the background in this one, it would make a nice instrumental. TI has nice lyrics and flow in this one too. Andre 3000 kills it when he's on he mike, anything he does is gold.<br /><br />4.) The way we ride 11/10:  This is my fav song on the album. Straight up pimp, I picture myself cruising downtown stuntin on top of the world w this one. The background music is transcendent, Chorus is infectious. Badd ass song.<br /><br />In summary, this album puts TI on the top of my list as best rapper in the game, I dont really care for the dboy references, but thats his story, I like that he is an overcomer. Furthermore,I appreciate his style and the way he incorporates that southen screw sound in his music.<br /><br />OVERALL  10/10
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|It was a bit gruesome at times, but overall I enjoyed the movie.  Funny, intsense, a little bit of romance.  Loved the main brother's voice...
0140544518|5.0|I use this story and the original story of the three little pigs to highlight how the point of view, or vantage point, of a story can dramatically change the story.  It also helps highlight why first person perspective is sometimes unreliable.  My 7th grade students love this particular lesson; engagement is always high and they grasp the concept well because they are already familiar with the original story.  I pair the reading of the two stories with a Venn diagram to help them isolate the similarities and differences between the two, as shown by the perspective change.
B009GEAWOU|4.0|Even though there is repetitive elements to the show, the comedy has stood up well after eight seasons. I would not say it is like the first few but on average is better that most shows after this long. I will be staying with it until it is canceled.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|My son loves it, I do not care for it myself but if the kids like it then it is worth it.
B0096BIENY|5.0|MY BOYS CAN DO NO WRONG - THEIR SONGS KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER - THEIR CONCERTS ARE TO DIE FOR - EACH ONE OF THEM SINGS LIKE AN ANGEL - EXCEPT SOMETIMES CARLOS' LITTLE HORNS SHOW -  THEY ARE TRULY A PLEASURE TO LISTEN TO AND WATCH -  I HAVE CONVERTED QUITE A FEW FANS FOR MY IL DIVO.  MORE CD'S AND DVD'S BOYS....... SEE YOU AGAIN AT A CONCERT....  RED SHIRT
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is my first Gillian Flynn and I had high expectations for this after the reviews I read, but I was a little letdown. The first half of the book was fantastic, I couldn't put it down, but the last half was a bit of a let down. All in all, an entertaining book.
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book. It was slow going at the beginning because it doesn't make a lot of sense. But after it started making crazy sense it was a crazy good book all the way to the last page. I read it on kindle but bought it hard back so all my friends could read it too so we could talk about it. Loved the book so much that I read her others.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My wife and I are only a few episodes in and we love it. It is deep but easy to follow, the characters are well played, the story makes you want more and the tasteful amount of nudity is a plus. I highly recommend the show. I can't wait to what the next episode.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Wow.<br /><br />Fantastic novellete. I would love to see more of this world, and more of Shai. A fascinating character and a fascinating magic system.<br /><br />I always love Sanderson, but this is an especially... soulful? book for him because almost the entire book occurs without the main character leaving one room.<br /><br />And a lovely twist at the end I only saw coming very very shortly before it happened.
B00A3T5CGU|3.0|but it's not as quick as My iPhone using the same program<br /> TomTom I do believe it well become a reality good program<br />it just needs some bugs taking out. I well still use it<br /> in THE hopes that it will get better.<br />Sam J F
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|Decent. But a little confusing. Eventually, though it comes to a point where I felt I was mostly following along.<br /><br />I still haven't quite decided how I feel about the magic system. It's very cool and clearly thought out, but it's not clear if it should be classed as a common magic system (the economy would suggest not) given certain seemingly common aspects of magic.<br /><br />I will pick up the next.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I enjoyed this novel due in large part to the repartee between John Corey and the local detective and others. It is an absorbing mystery which holds your attention, though it did drag a little towards the end.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|No interuptions for connection speed (I have a pretty slow connection). Quality was good.<br /><br />I will rent from Amazon again!
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I thought it was awesome that I could get a awesome new released CD for only $10. I couldnt go anywhere esle to get it...
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I'm using a Nexus-7 tablet and have loaded three book reading apps: Kindle, Nook, and Kobo. After using all three, I;ve come to this conclusion: The Kindle for Android app is second best. Pages look a little off, with too much margin at the bottom. They usually turn quickly, but occasionally it takes more than one touch to the edge of the screen. Loading the books from my library takes some time, as I have to refresh the kindle app after each book is purchased, and the process is not intuitive.<br /><br />I've found using the Night screen on all three apps makes the reading easier and seems to save battery life a little. It also tends to let my wife sleep more easily when I am reading late at night.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This film took my heart. I loved the Royal Tannenbaums and Fantastic Mister Fox, but the honesty of this little jewel is like a piece of rich dark chocolate (70% or higher) wrapped in marzipan. The colors and the fact that the principlel characters are so young might fool you, but the story is firs rate and the actors are amazing.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Not worth the four dollars I paid. A mess and a great disappointment.<br />Couldn't get the subtitles to work either.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|A film about a real relationship. People who look like people and working solutions. Marriage is not easy and we have to keep falling in love with each other. It really is worth it. But you both have to be in...That is what I learned:) from this film and the reason I keep recommending it to others. Deceptively simple. Still waters run deep.
B001H122N4|5.0|Love David Gilmour and this box set. All the little extras are worth the price for all you David Gilmour fans out there.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|This is a great family movie. I consinder it one of the best Christmas shows ever. My children love it. We originally saw it in the theaters last year. The bundle of disks is nice. So far we watched the 3D version.  We were not blown away by the 3D effect but that's true of most of the 3d movies we've purchased.  I'd probably pass on the 3d version if I had to do it again.<br /><br />The movie itself is awesome
B00881VLCE|3.0|I love puzzles and this kind of fills the bill.  Wish it were a bit more challenging.  Still I would recommend it.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|If you are planning on owning this $25 wonder, you probably realize it does not come with ANY documentation. You might be planning to just use the amazing variety of documentation in video, audio, and text form on the web. But that resource is bewildering in its vast size and uncertain quality. This is the book you want if you are just getting started with the Pi, especially if you are not fluent in Linux. The length is just right -- just enough on each topic to get you ready to graduate to the riches on the web. It focuses in detail on your first few hours with the Pi -- the time when you are most likely to lose heart and give up. The only thing I would add to this marvelous little volume are more pointers to web resources for the topics in each chapter and a good index.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Way better than expected! No need to see the other Batman movies first. Even my parents enjoyed this movie. Highly recommend.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|fantastic season. so much back story, sideways stories, and everything in between. if you would like to see this you have to watch the first two to capture the entire story line.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This is an interesting book, wondered where it was going at the beginning, but liked the way it developed. The message at the end of the book was wonderful.
B009329Y30|4.0|The movie was very good. Just as good as the book. I would recomend the movie and the book.<br /><br />Cordiually Yours,<br />Sharon Boyd
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I got this for my friend she was really happy.<br />Glad I was able to find it on here for a cheap price!
B005VPRET4|5.0|Great they finally came around to provide girls with the Friends line. Lots of small special pieces that can be lost but they also help make these friends sets more fun too. For kids younger than the age group noted either help from an Adult or a more experienced Lego builder will be very helpful but the picture guides are well designed to help them. I preffer toys like this that require the kids to think a little, invest some time and effort in the toy, and get exposure on following directions to end up with a creation they can play with.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I thought it would be a funny romantic comedy. It is not. I am sure the subject matter is applicable to some.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I think they should have focused more on Mike's entrepreneur story. Dance scenes were cool, but too much. Silly movie because they didn't.
B002FOAVGC|1.0|Liberal bleeding heart crapper. Horrible acting and completely nauseating. Worst film I have seen in years. Do not see this film, save your money.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I've never read a book like this one; most interesting I've ever read.  Recommend it for all ages, which is rare.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I was a bit dissapoibted with this one compared with the last two movies in he franchise.  I wanted to like it through the very end but it was a tough one to get through. The ending did have some redeeming qualities.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|While the original movie will always be the best, this remake is just wonderful - has become a holiday tradition to watch!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The story shifts in time from the Victoria's recollections as a girl to her halting steps to find her way as a young woman.  She spent her childhood in foster care and facilities and upon release became homeless. The story though at times heartbreaking is told in a restrained way often through her sometimes emotionally blunted perspective.  The exception to her seeming disconnection from life is her all encompassing love of flowers.<br /><br /> There is an underlying subtle mystery which, when ultimately revealed explains her rejection of those who would care for and love her.<br /><br />I could not stop reading this book.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Great theatricality, great cinematography but the whole story feels rushed up until the end. They leave an open ending for a sequel which is great, IMO. Not sure if Nolan will do any more, though.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|Say what you will about the Robert LePage production itself, the quality of these Blu-Rays is breathtaking! Not only is there excellent supplemental material, but the camera angles allow the viewer to appreciate the subtleties used by the singers on the stage, and the surround mix at times is so incredible you almost feel like you are in the pit surrounded by the Metropolitan Orchestra!
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Love this cd. Tip is back and showing folks who he really is...The King! A must have to add to your T.I collection.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is one of the best books on WW II combat I've read.  E.B.Sledge (SledgeHammer) was one of the characters in the &#34;Pacific'  film.  This book fills in some of the blanks in that series.  Read it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Keeps you guessing all the way through! I recommend to anyone looking for a easy read mystery with several twist.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this whole trilogy. I couldn't get enough of them. I'm reading them a second time already. I am definitely ready for a movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very steamy, very good, even on my kindle fire!  I love to have a book in hand, but this was really worth it on the kindle!
B005LAII1C|5.0|Besides all the army men violence on the big screen, we all wanted to have a good time and have a laugh. This Teddy bear has what it takes to offer a real good time. I only went to see it on a Tuesday after work. WOW, the auditorium was packed like sardines, but that did not ruin my experience, I Laughed Out Loud, so did everyone else. I could not stop laughing for a while. Not everyday I come across something such as this potty mouth bear, if there was a fun meter, it would be out of control!!
B0044RC12A|5.0|I did not order this product. Maybe someone else in my family did, but it wasnt me. I'm sure they are happy with their order and will order more of these as they know I would love to have all of the Desperate Housewives Seasons.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The news was heard all around the globe when The Dark Knight Rises opened in theatres in late July the 20th, there was this bloody shootout inside the auditorium. There was one survivor whom I believed was playing dead, that was cool and smart thinking; but let us not forget the victims who did not make it out alive, for we are truly sorry for the loss of lives in that one single night.<br />I am not exactly a Canadian, I am from London England. Doesn't matter, quite honestly, I was pretty darn scared myself if I went to see the movie on opening night, so I just told my friends and sibling that I was scared myself, knowing that The Dark Knight Rises was truly a masterpiece, last one in the trilogy and not to be missed. Amen.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|I'm glad I didn't spend $30. To see this movie in the theater with my spouse.<br />Other than that it was fine to watch on DVD.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I downloaded the Kindle to my Pandigital Novel and it worked great, then seemed to totally mess up the tablet so I took it off.  Would really love to have it on here, though.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Great acting and directing, story was original. Not sure if this movie is for everyone as the ballet, language, and some other elements might throw you for a loop. But if your looking for a unique movie this one is it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app for every day and for all  my travel destinations. I like all the options. it is full of information.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Phenomenal cast and acting, unexpected twists in the plot...there are a lot of good things to say about this movie.  It has some very thematic content so is definitely not suited for younger audiences.  It's the best movie I saw all year.
B002BWCJOA|5.0|Coraline is considered a children's book/movie, but it may be frightening for children. It has scary elements that may frighten young children. Being 20 years old, I still find this a great movie!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app will only load 10 comments an won't let you share pics .it's crap the other app was better don't update the original kindle was better than the new ones
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|This movie is fantastic for all ages!! Definitely recommend everyone to watch! Disney has really gone above and beyond in this animated film!
B002PJ8AE2|5.0|Great looking car plus it came with a doll. This is for my granddaughter for Christmas and I am sure she will love it also.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|You will absolutely LOVE this book it's one of my favorites. It all about Greg and how he has no luck with any girls.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|I followed the directions on how to download to my phone and it doesn't work.  It's not there when I open the amazon app on my phone.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This is great. Just watch it. Party scene is the best for sure. Pop a cold brew first as that is what ted would do!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I love this game it is very fun but I played for like a month and then all my progress got deleted... it is very irratating they need too fix it
B0090EHVMC|1.0|I think this a terrible interpretation of the Lorax. I love reading the book to my son and he has the old video too. Loved the original when I was a kid and now he does too. He is 5 and really didn't like this film. Too silly and the songs are dumb.<br />It should be called The Lorax goes Hollywood!
B008MEM24S|1.0|This is only a way for them to sell more product.  You have to buy things to play the game according to my son who tried to get it going for his son.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great buy, official Sony version. Good feel. Camo looks good too. I need 9 more words so blah blah blah
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am addicted to this game.  I find myself sometimes staying up later than I planned becasue I'm playing &#34;just one more game.&#34;
B005ML9YOU|5.0|It's a very good, complete collection, well-formatted for the Kindle, and easy to read even on my phone.  Quite enjoyable.
B004UID2LC|3.0|rarely use it. you require too many words.  I don't have anything else to say so I'll say I rearely use it.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I was delighted that Amazon Instant Video had How I Met Your Mother, as neither Netflix nor Hulu Plus has it.  I am very glad that I am able to catch up on what has happened so far this year, since we've watched the other seven seasons recently and would hate to have had to wait to find out what happens next.
030759565X|5.0|Gave this to two of my friends who cook a lot and they are both delighted with it. Got it quickly and on time
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I really like this movie froma stand point of have and have nots very likely we could emmulate some of this in the next 100 years at least with military service.  I am an archer so it intrigued me at the start. I dont expect a sequel
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is such an excellent movie for people who went to camp as a kid and young love! Buy it!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|It was a logical broadening of the story concept which we expected.  Done well yet not surprising.  The plot was easy to guess and the cast was good without being to far from the original plot.  Ill look for more and will watch the next one for sure.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|In my opinion MIB 3 is the best of the 3 movies. I love the plot and acting of Will Smith and the rest of the main players in this fine comedy.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|This was a great surprise the cast was good the story line was alittle short at the conclusion but ample to get me in the mood to watch it.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|The movie was very disappointing. the hype the movie had was overrated. I feel like I wasted my money on this movie. I feel like I wasted my time watching this movie. it was't everything it was said to be. don't get me wrong it had its moments. Overall very very disoappointed.
0374531269|5.0|A touching read on how war affects children and a story of violence touched with bits of hope.  Ishmeal's account of running from the war, being engulfed in the war as a child soldier, then escaping the war is well written and insightful.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As he says in the book, there are basically three kinds of readers - believers, skeptics and ambivalent. He is writing to the ambivalent with good reason.  Wake up - there is much more to &#34;life&#34; than the tiny realm created by our self centered three dimensional perceptions.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This &quot;new app&quot; loads a few post and thats all, I cant stress enough how horrible it is!  I wish  they wouldnt have messed with it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love it!  I wasn't sure I'd like this series but so many people talked me into it and I'm so glad.  How easy to watch it on your computer too!
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is pretty much the only movie you need to watch around Christmas time to get into the spirit! Nothing but laughs and good times..
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was a well put together game. Had a nice balance of puzzles and HO. The puzzles could had a bit more challenge but overall not bad, much enjoyed.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I love doing puzzles, but this was a slight disappointment. Couldn't get the screen larger to see the pieces better. Trouble manipulating pieces, too. Maybe it's just me since I'm a NEW Kindle Fire HD user.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is a love story like no other and some of you women can relate to this, I know I did. This movie tells you love with your heart not what other people want you to do. Meaning you only live once and if you choose money over love then in the long run you really haven't loved at all. That's what I got from this story, it may sound crazy but I know a few people who live this way and they cheat and lie and go back to their true love and just because the family didn't approve they have cheated themselves. It's sad... This movie is beautiful and the ending is perfect!!!!<br />I love this movie so much
B001E5CH0G|5.0|This movie rocks!  My kids and I love it. It really sets the mood for Christmas!  Ho ho ho ho
0470474874|5.0|I ordered the book for my wife who found it very helpful. She is a Financial Analyst and wanted an excel book for reference. Its a thick book with a lot of info. For advanced skills she bought the Learn Excel 2010 Expert Skills with The Smart Method: Courseware by Mike Smart.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I've read all of Grisham's books, and enjoyed them all.  The Racketeer is not his best, but still a great read.  Great twist that had me guessing.  Very entertaining.
B00633W614|3.0|I feel the publisher has learned that they can take one big book and break into 3 smaller ones to get more money!!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! Its challenging yet still a game. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|But watch out for the extras that kids can purchase. Also required reading. I would say it's for 8 and up.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! I would recommend this game to everyone. It has quickly become very addicting!
B0052VUNHC|2.0|This book is tedious. It's just so incredibly drawn out that you're begging for it to end. It got old quick.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is a fast, enjoyable read with a satisfying ending.  The only criticism I have is that the primaryl villain expired too quickly.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|It's alright. I can put all my music there to play it. Didn't care for the app for the phone, don't like anything that takes over my sd card. I usually use windows media player when playing music.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a cute fun app my daughter loves it great for kids and adults. I wish there were more options and more levels
B000FBFMZ2|4.0|For a couple hundred years in the future this science fiction seems pretty conservative, which might just say more about how much my mind focused on the story. I enjoyed my couple weeks with this book. I look forward to the other books in this universe.
B0095J0AL6|1.0|I have not received my order !!!! and there is no information about shipment !!! It is pitiful. The customer service is invalid
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but I'm believe that if something makes a mark in your life you should acknowledge it, that is what this book did for me. It was worth the tears I cried not only as a woman, but also as a mom, a sister an aunt and a best friend, to  be truly touched by this story. I highly recommend that you take the time to read this one.
B002RVCD0U|5.0|Very good movie a lot action from beggining to end.Me gusto mucho la history sigue a la primera Terminator .
B007MJSQSK|2.0|I got bored watching the movie. The animation is superb, but the movie itself was just too difficult to get through.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I had always wanted to read these books; great to have them in one place.<br />I am glad I made the purchase.
B0086C5EKA|1.0|I was unable to view the dvd.  It was printed &#34;unacceptable for viewing&#34; on any of my three dvd players!
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|This one never gets old. Angelina is the perfect Lara Croft. The writing, production value and of course Jon Voight make it great.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I thought the acting was fine but, the characters were idiots and the &#34; alien men&#34; were creepy. I would hope we didn't come from them.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I liked most the politically incorrect humor.<br />Beautiful and good actors.<br /><br />Predictable and a little too heavy on fart jokes.

B0084AXZK0|1.0|The story itself is interesting but the pages and pages of rambling non-sense ruin the book. A struggle to finish.
B0096PAA6E|1.0|Trust me, go buy his EP instead. All his good songs are there already and you'll have a much more enjoyable experience without getting dragged down by some Jason Derulo like songs. Seriously I get severe second hand embarrassment listening to certain songs on this album.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I loved the Kite Runner, and certainly was not disappointed with this novel.  I would probably add this to my Top 5 books that I have read of all time.
0684857219|4.0|This a must have book if you are interested in your health or want to start bodybuilding or just want to know more about how to get bigger. Its very in depth from your workout to how you should eat for your body type and its a good book to just read from time to time.
B0001HAISG|5.0|The quality of this movie was excellent.  It arrived promptly and it was worth every cent and some.  I had a great time watching my grandchildren laughing and enjoying Peter Pan.  This is one of my favorite movies and I loved the quality of the picture and sound.  We had a great time and they asked to watch it more than once.  I would highly recommend purchasing from this company.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Glad I got the five-book bundle, because you can't read just one.  Now thinking of getting the DVD's of the mini-series.
0767836324|5.0|The quality of this movie was excellent.  It arrived promptly and it was worth every cent and some.  I had a great time watching my grandchildren laughing and enjoying Hook.

B000SZK41M|5.0|Very well written - love that it shows that the so called &#34;smart guys&#34; (FBI) are not always - arrogant even, and the regular cops can contribute more than expected.  Great action scenes and love how it includes the Christmas theme which makes it one of my favourite Christmas holiday movies.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Great book... Haven't read it since high school.  Short and didn't take long, but helped get me in the Christmas spirit.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Once you start... You just can't put it down! It captures you completely. Love really does conquer all in this amazing novel!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Brave is another great leap forward in the American animation industry. From the setting to the costumes to the music to the quaint Scottish dialect, Brave is a masterful and mesmerizing tale of love told so beautifully in a message of timeless depth and power. From the opening scene, the viewer is swept away by the bold colors, the sympathetic characters, and the visual imagery that move across the screen and straight into your heart. You will fall in love with &#34;Brave&#34; time and time again.
B002M9WW30|5.0|excellent!!! stallone is great!!! a collection is terrible!!! my son is fanatic of this movies. I can not believe this collection have
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Like a lot of people, I looked into the book because I'd seen the movie. The movie is more optimistic, but the book is better. It's a series of solid punches to the gut examining class, race and the way history works. It uses six different modes of storytelling and a beautiful Matryoshka-structure to tell the story of humanity. Through the ages it shows the strong oppressing the weak, and the weak resisting and winning. &#34;The weak are meat, and the strong do eat&#34; is the refrain. Cannibalism is a motif. If you're familiar with the basic paradigms of sociology, it's a conflict theorist's view of history.<br /><br />It seems like a weird comparison, but I would draw parallels between this and the Avatar: The Last Airbender series. While one is necessarily less dark because of its target audience, they both show how humanity repeats its mistakes but somehow survives. The people of today become the legends of the next day. I also recommend Howard Zinn's &#34;A People's History of the United States&#34; as a non-fiction parallel. The strong are in league against the weak, but sometimes the weak win.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|So I recently found out that this is a pretty new mouse. I'm kind of a guy who likes to try out more unknown under the hood companies, as sometimes these companies have to try hard in order to sell their product as they cant afford larger marketing. I came across this as a 20$ sale on amazon, went to go on other sites to see if I should get it, then i asked myself, Hey why wont you try something new and review it. its not like 20$ is the largest amount of money, especially with a mouse of this hardware in it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Utilizes the same sensor as many well known gaming mouses(Razer Taipan(75$), Thermaltake eSports Level 10M(91$), Cooler Master Storm Sentinel Advance II(53$), Steel Series Sensei(50$+ depending on version))<br />+ Pulsating Lighting is pretty neat<br />+ Software is easy to use, already created macros on the mouse. takes both mouse and keyboard macros<br />+ Software also allows for pretty good control of mouse speed, ALL of the mouse colors for the Anchor image<br />+ Customizable Weights(but there is a slight downside, read the cons)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Could be heavier, weights added very little weight. My smaller Logitech 705 mouse is heavier. so if you like heavier mouses, you may want to customize your own weight system.<br />- Personally think the scroll wheel could slightly be better<br /><br />Nitpicks<br />~ Lighting under the scroll wheel and the dots on the left of it aren't changeable. I would like to change them(unless I missed something in the software)<br />~ Glossy Plastic may attract fingerprints and dust.<br />~ Opening the weight compartment was extremely hard, almost felt like i was going to break part of my nail off.<br />~ Right side is a bit too tucked in more my taste. Mouse is more for those users who like tight claw grips.<br />~ Anti-Virus may think the software is dangerous, as its from a company that isn't up there yet(it isn't Anker's fault)<br /><br />Other than that, its a pretty solid mouse. at 20$ its a great price. at its current 30$ price, its a pretty good contender for use. Its a mouse with a great sensor for its price, and standardized braided cable, its a pretty solid entry gaming mouse, especially for its price. Easy to use overall. Best part is that it shipped from San Jose, so i got the package 3 days in advance.

B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Joy to the world of crime fiction, Rebus is back with a bang. Standing in Another Man's Grave is one of the best crime novels of the year, and if you don't believe me that's your problem.<br /><br />As Ian Rankin came to realize letting one of your favorite heroes go is not an easy thing to do and thank god for that. Rebus, after taking a short break, returns to the pages of his creator and lets him know that it won't be so easy to get rid of him. What if he works in cold cases as an outsider? What if the unit is about to close? Nothing really matters to Rebus, apart from solving crimes and punishing the perps one way or another.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book he seems a bit lost as he enters a world where he's spend most of his life, but which now seems alien to him. His prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Siobhan Clarke now holds a higher position than him and she seems to be going places, unlike him whose life never changes. As he realizes at some point he's an analog man in a digital world. However analog sometimes is better than digital.<br /><br />Rebus is at his strongest when he's at his lowest. When everyone is against him he rises up to the challenge and gets things done. And when he's the target, he's the one who pulls the trigger first.<br /><br />One of the most interesting things in this book is the co-existence in the same pages of Rebus and Rankin's latest cop hero, Malcolm Fox. Fox doesn't like Rebus and he shows it, he's determined to take him down as soon as possible; but no matter how hard he tries he's never able to pin anything specific on him. Yes, he does have drinks with a mob boss, whose life he's saved, every now and then; yes, he does frequent places which he shouldn't; and yes, he does tend to take the law into his own hands time and again; but he gets results. He may be old school, but he goes where nobody else can. He may drink a lot, but he works more than everyone, despite his age.<br /><br />Fox and Rebus are similar in a way: committed, headstrong, restless, but they cannot see that. When they look at each other they only see yet another enemy, whereas if they were working together they could be friends, despite the fact that Fox doesn't drink.<br /><br />As for the story, it all begins with a murder that Rebus cannot investigate, and the reopening of an old case which he can. A woman shows up at the unit claiming that her daughter's disappearance many years ago is connected with those of some other young women. Rebus decides to take a look at the file and he sooner rather than later realizes that the woman had a point. All the women disappeared in the same area and they've never been seen ever since. So he starts investigating. And the more he investigates, the more clues he brings to light, and the more enemies he makes. He's no angel, everyone knows that, but when he's on the hunt he'll do anything to get his man. He doesn't care about department politics, public relations, and keeping up pretenses with colleagues, and that's his curse, and that's his blessing.<br /><br />Siobhan knows that where everyone else fails Rebus succeeds, so despite the fact that working with him could put her career in jeopardy at the end she decides to give him a helping hand. He'll do all the leg work, and she'll be there when the need arises. If not for any reason because she likes him; she likes the fact that he wants to bring justice to the victims no matter what; and he does make her smile.<br /><br />Well, all in all I'd say that this is one of the best Rebus novels yet. The good detective came back from his break stronger and hungry for action. What a character! Really, what a character! Thumbs up, Mr. Rankin., restless, but they cannot see that.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is great if you can't afford a kindle or don't like to lug yours around everyday! I really enjoy this app, I like being able to read my books even if I just get stuck somewhere and don't have my Kindle with me. It works the same syncs very fast.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was not as funny as the other books but it was funny sometimes by you should still read it

B008NW67E0|5.0|Unwrap it; acknowledge--however cynically--the current accolades going on about it before you give it a listen, and then just listen.<br /><br />It really is just that good. Mix the tracks as you would, it never ceases to satisfy.<br /><br />Too too too too good.

0316232955|4.0|Carson Phillips knows exactly what he wants in life, and sticking around his hometown of Clover is not in his plans. In order to achieve his goals, he needs to go to Northwestern University. In order to get into Northwestern, he needs to accomplish something unique--like starting a literary journal at his high school. The only problem? He can't even get anyone to write for the school newspaper. But Carson has spent almost eighteen years in Clover, and he and his friend Malerie observe things that other people might miss. And Carson is so bent on getting accepted, he won't rise above blackmailing his fellow students to get what he wants...<br /><br />Carson Phillips is a hilarious and sarcastic character and his misadventures in Struck by Lightning won't fail to amuse and entertain readers. Colfer tells Carson's story in a journal format, which is a little choppy, but this choppiness is perhaps appropriate considering the form. The characterization develops gradually, as does the plot, but readers won't mind terribly; Colfer's writing reads like a string of genuinely funny stand-up comedy routines with surprisingly acute insights on life and high school. The actual blackmail part of the story unfolds nicely and is a bit sly and a little unrealistic, but readers won't help but feel a little bit triumphant for Carson as he finally stands up to the people that have pushed him around for years and starts figuring out life. Of course, life never works out the way one expects, which is something that Carson struggles with, especially at the end of the novel, leading up to the surprising ending. Struck by Lightning is unexpected, unconventional, and perhaps a bit unrealistic, but incredibly witty and satisfying nonetheless.<br /><br />Cover Comments: I love how the broken pencil is arranged to look like lightning--very smart. This cover has a movie poster feel, which isn't entirely surprising considering the audience or author, but it turned out well. I like it a lot.
0525958002|4.0|I really like the book, I can almost relate to it. I am an only child too. I like the part when he met Nick, and about the Wedding Spaghetti, and being a Dad. I really enjoyed it. I liked the part when he turned his life around, and met a new girl. He enjoyed being with the group, and it sounds like he had a really good time with his band members, and I used to fall in love with him 25 years ago. I was almost 12. I like the story a whole lot better than 50 shades of grey.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I like Grisham but this one was not the best I have read. Compared to The Firm, A Time to Kill and Pelican Brief - for me, just not in the same league.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This was a fun movie to watch with my kids near Christmas time.  We enjoyed the clever spin on the Claus family and the gadgets Santa used to deliver all the presents around the world.  It's always nice to find a film that Mom & kids can watch and enjoy together. :)
1936719118|4.0|This little book while not in the style of a how to manual. Is a great little book! Just as the author states in one of the opening pages, a book you can read in an hour. Lots of great anecdotal stories about the authors experience with CD Baby. Its really more of a motivational book with some insightful pointers.<br /><br />Definitely not for some one looking for a comprehensive guide to do his or that.<br /><br />Just a neat little book about how this guy stared his company and grew it into the multi million dollar business that he never wanted, it stresses that point through out the book. Once he was tired of the stress and hours he sold for several million $$$.<br /><br />Very humorous and a great quick little read for some one who needs a quick dose of encouragement to get started as a life-style entrepreneur. While it was never intended to be any sort of biography obviously the author does elude to several glossed over facts that lead me to believe he  had a few inside edges that helped him get started along the way, that he does not fully mention.<br /><br />Overall a great little book for what its supposed to be, nice stocking stuffer for any budding online entrepreneur.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Amazing show, probably the best on TV. ALMOST beats Breaking Bad, but way scarier and suspenseful! Love every minute of it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Just didn't like it. Series of sexual fantasies held together by not much! I will not bother with any of the later books
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great selection of natural sounds and soothing music loops.  The best part is that you can mix and match several of your favorites to make your own personalized mix tape.  You can't buy a white noise machine with these capabilities--and this is free!
B00633W614|4.0|I read the first part of the trilogy almost a year ago & only had a hazy rememberance of it so this second part would be much more enjoyable had there been a brief summary of the first part up front.<br />Having said that I did get back into the full thread of the story about half way through. I always enjoy Jeffery Archer's writing & &#34;The sins of the father&#34; was no exception & I look forward to the third part of the trilogy
B00AMBH70S|3.0|As fans of the Bourne series we were anxious to see this film. I love Jeremy Renner and was happy to see him in this. It's action packed for sure, but relatively predictable in many parts. The motorcycle chase scene is far too long and becomes boring.
1881273377|5.0|Every couple needs to read/listen to this book! I got it for my husband in audio format even though we already have the book because, for one: he hates to read; and for two: he's a truck driver and enjoys listening to things while driving long distances every day. This makes for a good read on any road trip too...learn some valuable things about your partner while passing the time. A great way to &#34;kill two birds with one stone&#34;. You won't regret it! Oh... and my husband loved it.
B008602KQI|5.0|Hunger Games - Hard to put down, very engaging.I thought that it my be too juvenile but it was a great adult read.
B004BJMEO6|4.0|Very well done. Though it is a bit far-fetched to suppose that a pastor's wife could secretly be gay. There's also a running commentary of events by one of the actors that was annoying. Still liked it.
B00633W614|2.0|Archer had lost his touch - the trilogy, two to date, is written with little imagination and is very predictable. I am not sure that I will buy the third book at the offered price.There was a time when I enjoyed his writing.
1451648537|5.0|This is probably one of the first &#34;honest&#34; biography's I have read.  It told of his mistakes and well as his victories.  What an amazing man Steve Jobs was, and the world will sorely miss him!
B007OLYQ4E|4.0|I watched the movie Capote and was interested in reading all his books.  Breakfast at Tiffany's was a good, but almost too quick read.  It came with some other short stories that were enjoyable.  Just left me wanting more because they are very well written.

B007SSDBBM|4.0|The movie is pretty good, I think it had potential to be better though.  The score needs a lot of work.  If Hans Zimmer scored this movie, it would have been a different movie, a better movie.

The comic-book style kept my daughter involved and provoked some interesting conversations in our house about the freedoms US teens take for granted.  Heart and mind opening!!!
0345803493|5.0|Excellent book loved the three books hope to read more from this author good job on keeping the interest of readers
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I bought this movie for my 16 year old daughter having seen the original at the movie theatre.  I wasn't exactly excited about seeing it but I have to say IT ROCKED!  It shows that behind the &#34;showbiz curtain&#34; there is a lot of rejection and hard, hard work!  Even when she was sick or going through her divorce, Katy pulls it together to give her fans the best show ever.  She is super creative and the audience is constantly surprised by the next outfit for the next song.  Altogether entertaining and age appropriate.
B00A2IUHM6|2.0|Too much cussing, sex with a foul talking teddy bear? seriously? i thought it was in bad taste and<br />boring storyline.
B00633PFQC|4.0|Have not finished the book but the author articulates the ways economic power and elitism is insidiously corrupting the human spirit.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|It touches you on many levels, doing what a good book should - giving insight into ways of life and experiences beyond yourself and building empathy for others. It touches your heart like a soft petal on a spiky stem. I'll never look at thistle or moss the same way again.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|I love to count down the days until Christmas. I had so much fun waiting for<br /> each day to come so I could OPEN A WINDOW. I enjoyed this app VERY MUCH. It' s for 5 yrs.to 100. it,s for those who like to have fun.<br /><br />OH BY THE WAY I AM 72 and love to have fun. Thanks

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this on a Gold Box deal for $ 9.99 ... I have watched this series numerous times and will watch it over again. Initially I bought it because Netflix kept timing out and wanted my BF to get caught up with the goodness that is Firefly ... but am happy that I now have this to watch any time I desire. Will likely buy the movie as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought that this would be one of my first readings with a sad ending and I'm pleased to find out that it ended up just as all of us readers thought it would. Truthfully I don't wish for a fourth book because all my questions of Katniss, Peeta, Panem, and The Hunger Games have been answered. Thanks to Suzanne Collins for an amazingly realistic but incredibly fictional story that in a weird way inspired me.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I love this case! It fits my new Kindle perfectly. I also like the grooves on the case that allow me to rotate the Kindle in several different viewing levels. It's definitely a great product.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Love the App, both on my phone and on my ten inch tablet.<br /><br />The black ice alerts, though, appear to be raised whenever the temperature is below freezing and there is a chance of precipitation. That's just &quot;slippery&quot; to me. &quot;Black Ice&quot; is when the roads are so cold that exhaust freezes on them, making invisible, slippery surprises, especially at intersections. Temps are usually at 5F for that to happen.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|This is a great movie! The ending does put a little bit of a damper on the movie but overall an excellent movie!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett's first book in his Century trilogy introduces us to a large cast of characters from Wales to Buffalo to St. Petersburg, Russia, and weaves their stories together deftly  This is the kind of novel often described as a &#34;sprawling saga,&#34; and it deserves the label.  Rich descriptions of the horrendous conditions in which Welsh coal miners toiled and died segue to the trenches of World War I and the Russian Revolution.  One can't help but be impressed with the depth of the author's research and his storytelling gifts, and anxious to begin the second installment.  A great novel to dive into on a cold snowy day when you need an excuse not to go out.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Different, but very interesting.  One of many end of world scenarios out there, but I like the slant of this one.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|It's great that Amazon offers this quick guide to formatting your book for Kindle. Don't get me wrong. It's not perfect and you will need to check your uploaded version several times to get it right, but it does show that Amazon is trying to help aspiring authors succeed in a difficult market.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books that tell such a touching and heartfelt story. I recommend this book to anyone of any age that just wants to read a nice story.

B003YFIUW8|2.0|Reading this book from a 5 year old's perspective is quite tedious.  Jack's language skills are very erratic.  He uses some words far above the normal vocabulary level of a child his age but his grammar is not nearly at the right level considering the total contact he has with his mother every day and the television shows he watches.  It is very hard to relate to Jack's mother since none of the story is told from her perspective - we can only imagine what she is thinking and feeling.  You don't find out how they came to be in the room until you are nearly halfway into the story.  The story line has potential if the author had told it alternating between Jack and his mother.  I would not recommend this to anyone I know.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Terrific, dark but enough action and good stuff to keep me hooked. I love the heroin shes easy to identify with.
B000M39HB8|3.0|Good movie overall. Clean and family oriented, but not what Christmas is about. Astair should definitely stay away from singing and just dance. I have never cared for his voice.
B0076DELIG|4.0|In this fast-paced mystery, the readers follows Harry Bosch's ingenious path to discovering ruthless killers. Fans of Harry Bosch will not be disappointed.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Loved the story and the characters.  The flaming red hair and the Scottish accents are delightful.  The father is a big lovable guy.
B0063GORYU|5.0|LOVE LOVE This gamePlay more than i should really can't put it down . Now i have the pen to move the cards i love it even better Thanks Scott Bailey
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I am a big fan of this series, reading them in order. This one really delivers! Every title in the series delivers a punch, but this one is the best &#34;who dunnit&#34; to date. The twists are breathtaking. Jo Nesbo has a real gift for writing a vivid, lean narrative with just the right amount of background and character development. I find that the reader receives insights and impressions through well tuned vignettes. Characters drop into the story....then enter later, sometimes numerous times...and, somehow, the sensitive reader begins to &#34;get&#34; who they are while developing expectations for their actions. It's subtle, effective, and so engaging.<br /><br />I do wonder how The Snowman would work as a stand-alone for the reader who is making a first visit to the series. I think it would work ok, but a familiarity with Hole and all of his talents and demons enhances the experience.
B0002UOK04|5.0|Former Ensiferum Jari Maenpaa's Wintersun debut album. Very Finnish, epic and tremendously technical metal for those who like their metal extremely melodic and emotional. Absolutely awesome.
B008NMT684|4.0|It is very similar to the animal puzzles by Pixel Envision. I wish there were more puzzles (we paid $2 for the upgrade).<br /><br />My son thinks it's great.
B00902MCVY|5.0|WOW !!!!!!!!!  Almost unbelievable, but this is way more epic and complex than their first album, which is my favorite album since like the 90s...More slow songs and clean vocals than the other album, but extremely melodious and beautiful.  The amount of detail, the depth of the tracks, it's simply crazy.  The song \\"Sons of winter and stars\\" might the single greatest song ever written.  It's like Rush and Mozart met and decided to do metal.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder,  By R. J.  Palacios. A very compassionate look at teenage issues and prejudice.  Well written.  Positive ending.  Recommended to me, age 65, by my teen grandaughter.  Thank you!
B0063IH60K|5.0|it works nothing special but its free and does what it says it does ok hows that ummmm I'm not sure what else to say
B001HBYHFA|5.0|In the same way Field of Dreams reached people who did not care for baseball movies, Serenity reaches even those who are not sci-fi enthusiasts. It has all the ingredients that make a movie great.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I don't think Robert Ludlum would have approved of this story. The overview states that &#34;Aaron Cross needs to finish what Jason Bourne started...&#34;. This movie does not succeed in accomplishing that. There were some good action scenes and Jeremy Renner was good, but I thought it could have been much better...
B003TJR2HS|4.0|This converter fits perfect for big cases. I would recommend this to anyone that has a massive bulky case that block 30pin cables or docks.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|ok this is a classic must see movie of all time.....the music is hillarious 80s all the way ....the cast is stellar....my favorite are the scenes with the agent ... hysterical...i use quotes from this movie in my everyday life thats how good this movie is mmmmkay?<br />lolol enjoy!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The most epic game evr on iphone but I didn't get it on mi kindle. Even so I don't care becuz this game is definitely worth buying on ios. U have to play this amazing campaign mode also dude its so freaking AWESOME&iexcl;!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!
B0042UEU8M|4.0|My wife liked this movie a lot more than I did but that is to be expected.  It is a decent movie with an interesting even if predictable storyline.  Overall it was enjoyable to watch but certainly not groundbreaking in any way.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|It shipped so fast, i was really surprised. I got it just in time to give it to my sister for christmas, and i'm sure she's going to love it!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Decent storyline but Renner's character was not a suitable replacement for Jason Bourne. Hoping for Damon and Greengrass to bring the series back to life.
0439023483|3.0|When I read this book, everyone had loved it, so I assumed I would love it to.  The beginning plot was one never heard of before. In the ruins of America lies Panem. Panem is the ruins of the world from a war between the Capitol and the Districts. Every year, one boy and one girl are selected into the annual Hunger Games. 24 people enter the Hunger Games, but only one leaves Alive. Unfortunately, after I read the first 20 pages or so, I could predict most of the outcome. When Katniss and Peeta were selected, I didn't know that in the end, they would both win. However, I knew that Katniss would have to fight her way to the death match. The Hunger Games was full of detail and suspense, just like the movie. However, I would rate the book better than the movie because of the fact that in the book, you can picture Katniss better than the Directors of the movie did. Also, you can read her thoughts, something you couldn't do in the movie. This didn't get five stars because I could have read the first twenty pages and the last twenty pages and still have understood the entire book. It was a good read, but I hope the future books improve on this.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This is supposed to be the best for many applications.  I have no reason to dispute this though do not have the capacity to do those tests so cant confirm or deny.  I used it based on successful ad campaigns and testimonials. i can not make any more comment than that
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci departed from his familiar PI stories and did a great job on this thriller. I like Baldacci and will definitely read more of his books.
B0001I55NS|5.0|This is a good copy, clear no problem areas.  I liked the movie and saw a good deal on it and could not find it on my rental service, so bought it at this good price. am satisfied

B009HEJXFS|5.0|Pleasantly surprised! A great way to finish the series! Reclaims the magic from MIB I! Broilin is cleverly cast as a young Agent K! Chemistry between him and Smith was as that of Jones and Smith! Again, excellent and entertaining movie!

B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie as it was so much like many marriages. It made you see that there can be a happy ending.
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver manages to turn what is often dry subject material into an always interesting and sometimes absorbing read.  Because of the way the book is constructed, it is easy to read a chapter or part of a chapter, and then return to it a few days later without needing to review material you have already read.  Silver is a very clear, concise and insightful writer.
0307352145|5.0|This book is a must read for introverts, it validates them, supports them, and encourages them.  It is very affirming and lets us introverts know that we are very valuable in a society that tends to favor extroversion.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thought the writing was the worst I've ever read and I read a lot of books. Nonetheless, it was captivating and kept me wanting to read more. I wanted to meet Christian Grey, just because the descriptions of him were so good. Interesting book.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|We saw this movie by flipping around on the TV and thought it was excellent.  We wanted to show it to our grand kids but could not find when it would be shown again, so we ordered it on Amazon.<br /><br />We showed to our oldest grandson.  He thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />The quality of the picture was excellent in HD.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Sometimes quite sad but a great story about the trials and tribulations and recoveries and strength it takes to live. I learned so much about flowers and its what really saved this young girl. A Great Read
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a quick book to read as I did not want to put it down.  From the perspective of a teenager who liked to learn about the world around him in India and how he coped and survived the sinking of the ship his family was taking to relocate to Canada.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|REally enjoyed this book. It makes you think about how changing 1 significant event can effect the world we live in.  Very thought provoking
B002NANLCE|3.0|I expected this to be more like the tv show (not sure if that would be good or bad!)<br />The book was a little over-the-top sci fi for me.  Too much scientific detail.
B000FC1HQY|5.0|Great authentic read. Wish I had read it before her book Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness. An amazing story of a family's  survival in a war torn world.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I liked Will Smith but the synergy between Smith and the younger Jones was not there like it is between the older one and him.  In the past the creature characters had a good vibe to them, there was some good and bad, funny and not so but all and all rounded toward the overall feel of the story.  This one was overall just a bit darker in feel and the creatures rounded toward that.  Too much drama.<br /><br />I have seen all the previous ones (and have the DVDs) but will probably not buy this one.If you loved the first two you will like this one, if not it will not improve your feelings about them.
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|Nuanced, intelligent performances all around. I found myself pulling for both Albert and Victoria even though history had already informed of how it would end. Surprisingly endearing film. Stayed with me for days.
B0026IPAJA|5.0|With an idyllic setting, moral and social conflicts, fear and courage, friendship and family, imagination and faith, BABE touches the heart and head. This is a timeless, magical tale....... subtle and substantive, for viewers of all ages.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|From start to finish the kindle book made a huge difference. I recommend it to anyone that wants to self publish.

B009JBZH54|5.0|What else is there to say? 3 great movies on blue ray!! enjoy your triology, comes with some cool photos as well
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It was a good action movie, but it did not meet my expectations.  I was dissapointed with the story behind the villain Bane, but I wont get into details, I'm just really glad I chose not to spend extra money at the theaters to watch it- because I know I would have been a bit more dissapointed.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Nice novel for rainy weekend :) I would say this one is mostly for girls. Actually this is my second time I'm reading this book, I will remember some sentences till the rest of my life.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This was a decent movie. I like Matt Damon better but Renner did an okay job. I'd recommend it. Good!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Everyone should try this app. It is so epic my friend recommends this to everybody!<br />He's a pro gamer and still plays this epic game!
0312427999|5.0|In THE SHOCK DOCTRINE, Naomi Klein explodes the myth that the global free market triumphed democratically. Exposing the thinking, the money trail and the puppet strings behind the world-changing crises and wars of the last four decades, The Shock Doctrine is the gripping story of how America's \\"free market\\" policies have come to dominate the world-- through the exploitation of disaster-shocked people and countries.<br /><br />At the most chaotic juncture in Iraq's civil war, a new law is unveiled that would allow Shell and BP to claim the country's vast oil reserves.... Immediately following September 11, the Bush Administration quietly out-sources the running of the \\"War on Terror\\" to Halliburton and Blackwater.... After a tsunami wipes out the coasts of Southeast Asia, the pristine beaches are auctioned off to tourist resorts.... New Orleans's residents, scattered from Hurricane Katrina, discover that their public housing, hospitals and schools will never be reopened.... These events are examples of \\"the shock doctrine\\": using the public's disorientation following massive collective shocks - wars, terrorist attacks, or natural disasters -- to achieve control by imposing economic shock therapy. Sometimes, when the first two shocks don't succeed in wiping out resistance, a third shock is employed: the electrode in the prison cell or the Taser gun on the streets.<br /><br />Based on breakthrough historical research and four years of on-the-ground reporting in disaster zones, The Shock Doctrine vividly shows how disaster capitalism - the rapid-fire corporate reengineering of societies still reeling from shock - did not begin with September 11, 2001. The book traces its origins back fifty years, to the University of Chicago under Milton Friedman, which produced many of the leading neo-conservative and neo-liberal thinkers whose influence is still profound in Washington today. New, surprising connections are drawn between economic policy, \\"shock and awe\\" warfare and covert CIA-funded experiments in electroshock and sensory deprivation in the 1950s, research that helped write the torture manuals used today in Guantanamo Bay.<br /><br />The Shock Doctrine follows the application of these ideas through our contemporary history, showing in riveting detail how well-known events of the recent past have been deliberate, active theatres for the shock doctrine, among them: Pinochet's coup in Chile in 1973, the Falklands War in 1982, the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Asian Financial crisis in 1997 and Hurricane Mitch in 1998.<br /><br />To complete the picture, freedom lovers must also read How the World Really Works by Alan B. Jones.  Together these two books explain the inexplicable: why do our elected representatives pass laws that not only benefit the ultra rich for paltry few campaign contribution dollars, but do so to the detriment of the poor and middle class?  What would motivate leaders to CREATE wars that kill and maim our own and kill and make refugees out of hundreds of thousands of foreigners, which make Americans less safe not safer?

B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Loved the movie thought it was great. Plenty of action from start to finish. I had to give it gave it 5 stars.
B000002KE2|4.0|Back in 1971, a friend of mine turned me on to a different world of music.  It was in his downstairs bedroom that I first heard Alice Cooper, The James Gang (nothing I had ever heard before prepared me for Funk # 49), Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath. While I found Black Sabath to be a bit dark (too much thrum-thrum-thrum), I thought Master Of Reality was worth listening to and bought it. (Never truely got into Iron Man, Paranoid, or War Pigs). About a year later when I heard that Vol. 4 was coming out, I kept my eyes open because this was promising to be really special.<br />There was a store in the local mall that had a three for $10 special that ran all of the time (!).  Every Saturday, I was there looking to find three albums that would be that weeks treat (The trouble usually was what to save for another week, not finding a third album to make the special) I kept my eyes open for Vol 4, but it took almost two months after it had been released for them to finally get their shipment.  (Yes, distribution sucked in 1972)  It was out in the music stores, but Black Sabbath had such a reputation that none of them played this album.<br />So I finally got Vol 4, Thick As a Brick, and Fragile in December of that year.  What a true experience to com home and put those three on.  It was one of the best selections that I had ever managed to get for that special.<br />The problem came when I tried to turn other people on to Vol 4.  Black Sabbath fans thought it was too soft and for others, Black Sabbath's reputation as \\"Satanic\\" made them a no-go. But I thought it was one of the best albums I had heard from the heavier range.  It was much more melodic, even though it was heavy, than the first three albums.<br />No one even would take the time to listen.  I was making mix tapes for people, and I used to sneak \\"Changes\\"  on for girls and one of the heavier tunes for the guys.  Nobody complained, but they got pretty stupid when the heard that I had put Black Sabbath on their tape.<br />In addition, at the time, the album was pretty resoundly trashed in the music press.  Circus Magazine gave it The Boot.  (Now in retrospect they did the same to Exile on Main Street).  It didn't take long until you just couldn't find it anywhere because Warner Brothers didn't bother to make second run pressings.  (I seem to remember having seen it in remainder bins and wondering WTF!)<br />Black Sabbath is credited with inventing Heavy Metal.  In Vol 4, they created the \\"Heavy Metal Album\\".  Everyone who is considered to be hard rock follows this pattern.  There is at least one slower ballad on the album and at least one song that is lighter than most of the tracks.  There is usually an instrumental, experimental number.<br />Over time, I lost interest in Black Sabbath (Vol 4 was the peak of my interest).  Vol 4 was replace by this album then that album, until I really forgot about Black Sabbath as even producing music.  Sometimes I would be reminded of them, like when the movie Iron Man used the beginning of Iron Man in the trailer, or The Osbornes.  I had two compilation discs, The Ozzy years and the Ronnie James years, but they only got a little play time.<br />This week, I was watching one of my favorite Internet blogs (Cinemassacre:  Shameless plug for James Rolfe) when they did a Black Sabbath: Name that tune.  I began to wonder how much a copy of Vol 4 would cost and bought it on the spot as an impulse.  While it is a bit dated, I still think that this is among Black Sabbath's finest work and wish that it was better known because they would have received a good deal more respect than they have received.  (BTW:  I never heard Rock and Roll Doctor until I bought one of the compilation discs and that is an awesome song too.).<br />In addition, at the time, the album was pretty resoundly trashed in the music press.

B00190OHD6|5.0|A friend highly recommended this film, and with nearly five stars, I thought - why not? I didn't actually read the reviews, but maybe I should have. It might have prepared me for the emotional tug-of-war that was about to ensue.<br /><br />This is definitely one of those movies that reminds you of your own humanity. If you haven't cried in a while and wonder if it's even possible to cry, watch this. You'll be surprised at how easily you connect to the characters (and, therefore, crumble with them) as they move through the various stages of grief from different perspectives (first person as the heroine herself, or third person as her family/friends/neighbors).<br /><br />If you've ever been in one of these positions, you'll understand why this film got such great reviews. It's not a feel-good make-you-happy film, it's a reminder that life is precious, and we're all in this together. Enjoy it, the message is priceless.
B002APU580|5.0|Love the book and love the movie. The movie has such beautiful cinematography and the actors are very good. Such an entertaining and romantic rendition of the book.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Thought it was great--different and quirky. Like me! I could totally see Bradley and Jennifer in their parts. Awesome read!
B006LS7DQE|3.0|I love this game but it loses 2 stars for the lack of multiplayer.  You can play multiplayer on the Google Play store and Apple App store version.  I'm emailing the developer and I'll update my review after I get a reply.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The Google Play store version might be single player only too.  The iOS version is definitely multiplayer.  I'm still waiting on a reply from the developer.
0061673730|3.0|It's hard to understand how the word Zen made it into the title, since the book itself never really spends much time with Zen practice or ideas. Set as a road trip, the novel recounts the reunification of a personality split by shock therapy into a before and after. Alongside this narrative is a philosophical investigation that attempts to dissolve mind/body dualism ending with a frontal attack on classical Greek philosophy (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle). It takes thousands of miles and dozens of monologues, but eventually unification is attained by reaching BACK to the pre-Socratic Sophists. But as any road trip will tell you, there's no going back. And just as the narrator's unified personality utilizes his newly found dedication to motorcycle maintenance, the answer to mind/body lies ahead of us. Think neurobiology: now mounting the most telling rebuttal to mind/body and, ironically, a direct descendant of the systemic approach to knowledge created by classical Greek culture.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Amazing CD. Mumford & Sons really puts their heart and soul into every track that they produce. One of the best records of recent memory.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|i hated it the then i started to like it as it progressed on, into he last few episodes, it really got better the drones and limited resources, ihatedthey ended it without finding out about the humans from the earlier destiny, i like to think they created the drones to protect them as they were transporting to the the other planet, but we will never know and if eli finds a away to fix the stasis pod....well ....we'll never know...thankx
B001JRB16U|5.0|We love Mary Poppins.  I was surprised to see how my my 5 and 3 year old loved it too.  I had to buy it after watching them recreate all the song scenes.
B009MO5960|5.0|this movie is like like a prequel ending i hope to think this will be the last, milla starting to look old, you can tell if seen the first one, they have a lot of makeup and digital enhancement on her, i like this one better, than resident2 that to was the worse, with the super zombie guntoter, that was was her friend....this one was good better than the 2nd one but not better than the 1st...i bought this to add to my collection i already  had the first 5............thankx
B007SGLZP8|3.0|As usual from Grisham of late, decent storytelling; the plot and even the &#34;gotchas&#34; are formulaic. Still, entertaining and a good light read for some time killing.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|this is a great classic movie, showing what would happen to society if an all nuclear war would happen, you see this through the fictional character lives, and see the the back drops, and radiation sickness, very good movie...thankx
B005LAIHY0|4.0|It was a good film but I admit I certainly expected more similar to the other alien franchise.  Maybe the next chapter will be more exciting and in debt.  However this film keep you hoping for that \\"wow effect\\"  but ultimately does not deliver what you were hoping for.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Wonderful book.  Would recommend it to anyone.  The guy was a true hero and his compatriots were as well.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love 101-in-1 games!! its so awesome to play everyday.<br />AWESOME GAME. And has awesome game's. you should really get it.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book was definitely worth reading.  I was impressed that it didn't favor either political party, but just concentrated on the facts of each president and his terms/problems.  Excellent!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoy reading books which are different from the'run of the mill' and Pi falls into that category.<br />Did all the exceptional events actually happen or were they imagined by a fevered brain after surviving so long at sea in a lifeboat ?<br />Pi is an interesting and adaptable character as is his companion the tiger.<br />The whole story develops smoothly and references to various religions give an added interest.<br />I liked the omnipresent menace of sharks and the resourcefulness of Pi himself.<br />Now to see the film.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|I really enjoyed the few twists with the characters that keep you wondering who are the &#34;good guys&#34; and the &#34;bad guys&#34;.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|A well written movie. Great acting a smooth no lag stream. I'm definitely renting more movies from Amazon.Stan Lee is da man!!!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Not often is a mainstream network sci-fi show going to be good, but Falling Skies delivers.  There are likable characters, a well written plot that doesn't break that weird suspension of disbelief that is allowed to sci-fi shows.<br />I don't have much clever or insightful to write, so give it a shot.  If it's your cup of tea, you'll continue.
1557048630|5.0|I am not ashamed to say this, but I am a 58 year old woman who loves dragons.  I began my journey when I read the Ann McCaffrey books in the Dragon Riders of Pern series many years ago.  Then \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" came to the movies.  The bond of man and dragon was rekindled in a new tale of wonder.  The care and artistry of every animator who touched this film is evident.  As the credits rolled by at the end of the movie, I saw more wonderous images of other dragons.  I had to have a book, or poster, or some thing I could touch and feel that belonged to me. This book was the answer to my wish.  Each character, every dragon, every bit of scenery, and imagination of every artist and actor who touched this film is illustrated in this book. It is just fabulous.  The care, the detail, the dedication to bring the world of Berk to life shows in the illustrations of every artist.  Thanks for giving wings to my world again.  I love this book!!!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This didn't make sense to me. In the original movie, what the resistance was fighting for made sense. In the original, the resistance were fighting for oxygen/natural atmosphere. In this remake, I'm not clear what the fight is about...class warfare? Workers in the colony who only work in industrialized &#34;New Britain?&#34;<br /><br />Don't like that Colin Ferrell killed Kate Beckinsale, the pretend wife. Better in the original when the girlfriend offed Sharon Stone (playing Schwarzenegger's pretend wife). And I didn't like the Obama money either...is this more &#34;worker&#34; symbolism. The political undertones take away from the enjoyment.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Well done, Lee; you haven't lost your touch. Jack's busted nose was a great new slant and I loved the Karen Delfuenso cover-up. A Wanted Man may have disappointed some, but I don't agree; coming with new angles is no mean feat. As the author of A Darker Gold, I can tell you, there aren't many thriller writers out there who even come close to your Reacher series. (and that's for sure!) [[ASIN:1479137677 A Darker Gold]]
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This is definitely a guy's movie. So much crude guy humor in this. Mark Wahlberg's ability to go from serious to side splitting, hilarious actor is amazing. I'm seriously thinking of buying this. Absolutely hilarious.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer by John Grisham<br />Could not put the book down, got into it from the start. One of his better books.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoyed the suspense the last 6 chapters could not put it down another great Michale Connelly Novel. I will contiue read and enjoy Michale Connelly books
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is an all around great movie. It is such a funny movie and great for the whole family. Pop you up some popcorn and sit back and enjoy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find this app very practical. Especially if I am working on projects and just need a calculator. Very handy.
0316286850|4.0|It was a gift well received!  My granddaughter was pleased to receive it and is using it and getting raves.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Totally Taylor...downloaded it for my nephew and daughter to listen to, however I find that I enjoy the tunes myself.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun - but not too challenging.  I'd like to see a good version of &#34;Spider Solitaire&#34; show up for use.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|If you loved her previous cds, you will love this one as well.<br />I ordered this one for my mom as Susan Boyle is one of her favorites.<br />My mom is convinced she has the voice of an angel.
0767817710|3.0|I liked the movie and I bought it because I am a big fan of Gene Hackman and Sharon Stone.  I enjoyed it because they were in it and I do watch it from time to time.  A fun movie but if you are looking for something real in regard to the old west - buy Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book was free on Kindle, but if I had paid $40.00 for it, I would still be satisfied.  It was invaluable.
B000SEH13C|5.0|This is one of the best novels I've ever read. Technically it's science fiction, but not of the dry, gadget-dependent variety. In fact it's not until you're halfway through the book that you go &#34;Oh! Science!&#34; The personalities are so strong, the relationships so deep, the landscapes so vivid... I strongly recommend it.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|DeMille has such a vivid imagination and fantastic writing skills.  He paints pictures that the reader is able to visualize each and every personage. Great read.
B009GEEMLY|1.0|2 hours of my life I will never get back.  Really disappointing. Nothing else to say.  bad, bad, bad, bad
B0095T3H2U|4.0|Very funny and very intertaining.  Really enjoyed this movie.  Good laughs all through.<br />Would recommmend to all my friends. Loved it.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Kept you interested with twists.  A few sections were graphic, but not to excess.  I'll be looking for other books from this author.
B004INNRFK|5.0|The recipient of this gift let me know that she loves both the music CD and the tv program captured on the DVD.
B004GVUPFE|5.0|This is very similar to a cars & trucks game that I have.  I really love thinking it all through.
B005GYY0GA|4.0|Gotta love these duets, good driving songs, good beer drinking songs, good sitting on the porch in the shade songs.
B0053YGYO4|1.0|this is thier worst album to date, what happened to coldplay?? this is trash.<br />do not buy this cd is not worth it.<br />they have lost thier edge.
B009ANAQ4S|4.0|Wish the songs were shorter and maybe more on the album, but over all a good sound and typical Van.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|I could say it might be my device, but having just bought the Kindle Fire HD, I doubt that. It always says it won't work because the camera is busy, went it is not.
B008I43DYU|4.0|I found this app while Christmas shopping with my wife. She needed to know what items were going to cost after discounts. For people with older eyes it's got big characters and big buttons for us fat fingered people.
B0099114WO|5.0|Great Movie. Every married couple should have a copy. We purchased a copy for my parents. Happy, sad, heartfelt, and honest are all words I can use to describe this movie.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Free app that turns my kindle into an inexpensive alarm clock. Works great. Costs nothing.What more can I say about it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great Book!  One of the best ever!  Love Harry Bosch - hope he keeps writing another 20 years about Harry.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Only a weird genius could imagine putting a spooke movie with a Christmas theme, to us it ranks right up there with Tim Burtons  The Nightmare Before Christmas..
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|We had to watch this on a lower volume as the kids were upstairs sleeping. This impacted the viewing pleasure more than it should have. I got the sense that this movie was really great in theaters due to the special effects and awe inspiring sensory overload. However when you tone that down it reveals a story that seems a bit disjointed at times, sometimes explaining too much, sometimes too little. The emphasis was on a lead up to action or a supposedly emotion inducing scene; all these things seemed to jump around, like a graphic novel would, only we aren't encouraged to use our imaginations as much. I still enjoyed the movie, much of the acting was great (Bale was awesome), but overall it didn't have the same feel that Batman Begins or The Dark Knight did. Even Alfred seemed off his game...
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am sorry because I am a big fan of J.K. Rowling and her imagination and writing in the Harry Potter series, but this book was such drivel.<br />I stuck it out and read the entire book, but it was a waste of time. I was hoping something of interest would happen. It was very slow and I never became invested in the characters.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is the best Movie that I have ever seen and our family loved and have watched more than Five times more. Especially for my daughter Kate, she loved it so much! You must watch it!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Being a middle school language arts teacher, and having read the first book, The Hunger Games, I think both these books are appropriate for the 6th, 7th, and 8th grader. Good storyline, well written, but for a younger reader.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I enjoyed this game immensely, I had to uninstall due to space constraints but as soon as I get a new phone I will be re-downloading it again
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Well written and a good story for the middle school student. I liked the characters and wanted to keep reading.
B0086700CM|1.0|It installed fine, would boot up and run me through the tutorial, after it let me &#34;free&#34; to play on my own the controls would stop responding and I would instantly die, then the game would freeze forcing me to pull the battery every time.  UNINSTALLED!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My sister and I had a great time playing.  We trade off.  The graphics are great!  A little different and more creative than the original Angry Birds.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Sexy but a good fast moving story,the characters are strong. I like the overall theme of all the books and would recommend.
B0017P520U|5.0|My kids are so addicted to this movie that I think they have managed to watch it at least 4 times in about 4 days.  I think I can safely say that you will not be disappointed.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|This powerful yet heartwarming film score is, in my opinion, one of the best John Powell has created.  It's does exactly what a film score should, which is complement the movie and heighten the overall experience.  However, unlike some other scores, this one is more than capable of standing on it's own.  It's fun, joyous, exiting, and energetic and truly captures every dazzling moment of the film.  The How to Train Your Dragon score is a piece that I could listen to again and again, and has certainly earned it's spot in my list of all-time favorites.
B0058VW36U|3.0|Very cute!  I loved playing this game until it became too hard and I couldn't get past a level.  I'm stuck!
B009IKPOUO|5.0|I LOVE BARBRA<br />she still has one of the best voices on this planet -<br />CLEAR  and GORGEOUS<br />I LOVE IT
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My library downloaded this app for me and I have read hundreds of books - novels, history, cookbooks... whatever you like!  I know that there are other readers available, but I don't need to look any further.  KINDLE is the reader for me.  Works great!
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Couldn't follow the plot or hear the dialogue. Batman runs around after getting stabbed in the stomach, not to mention having the knife twisted. The worst Batman movie ever.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|After completing all previous Angry Birds, it was a challenge to get used to warped space.  Anyway, it was fun and I enjoyed completing it.  What's next?
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Arrived early was new-plug and play. What else is there to do but eat popcorn!?! I recommend this movie if you don't own it yet!
B007ZD17XO|2.0|This takes forever to load...but it is very dramatic and action-packed once you get started.  I prefer a simpler 3-match game.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Book was recommended for a monthly book group. Having a 14 year old son made this read even more intriguing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I celebrated when a recent update gave me more puzzles to solve!  This is fun!  Easy at first... but progressively harder.  Great game!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is my favorite author. I anticipate every novel. If the clandestine services operated like Mitch Rapp, there would be no more terrorist attacks on the US.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A little bit of strategy and a whole lot of fun!  This is a cute and imaginative game!  It is challenging enough but not too hard - if I can complete all the levels, so can you!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I am a Patricia Cornwell fan, and this is one of her best! A real page turner. many surprises along the way.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|This bag is well built. It looks great and quite spacious as well.<br /><br />My only qualm is that its side pockets are small, and it costed me my $25 coffee mug. I put my coffee mug in the side pocket and it slipped out of it. I was suspecting something like this to happen looking at the size of side pocket.<br /><br />My previous Targus had generous sized side pockets that would have room even after putting coffee mug. However, this one had better looks than Targus, so went with this one.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I always enjoyed reading Stephen King at first. I then waned in my appreciation of his work. I picked up this book on Kindle because of a comment by a friend. It is the best Stephen King book I have read. I always thought about going back in time and changing things and this character has the opportunity to do so. The results of his actions couldn't be predicted. You will enjoy it.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|It it over???I need to know what happens next...is it coming back????<br />Can someone tell me??<br />Bring it back!!!  Please.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Not at all stuffy or pedantic.  This movie is accessible to anyone.  And you don't have to be some sort of fan of the Royals as this movie is more about the teacher than the student.
B0072OFM28|5.0|this is a show that everyone should have in their collection ! it will grab you and not let go !
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Fairly silly movie but fun nonetheless.  Standard buddy movie with the girlfriend breaking them apart with added weirdness of the bear.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|I actually was expecting a way more funny movie...  Sad that most funny parts are shown during previews and then when you watch the actual movie, you feel like you have already seen it just based off watching so many previews.
B0049VVE7Y|3.0|Most of the plot came from 28 Days Later and a lot more of it doesn't make sense. It's fun to watch until the really poor dialogue gets to you. I bought the entire season before I watched any and I was fast fwding through lengthy emotional scenes that did  nothing for the plot right away. Maybe watch it if you cant find any other single show in the world to watch first.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is awesome for the free part, but the only bad thing is that it is very easy to beat the free version of it.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Anyone who suffers from anxiety will certainly appreciate and understand that it is a real thing, and this book helps to teach that it can be controlled, with the right people.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Elf is a delightful winter romp! It is family-friendly except for a negligee scene, and a few curse words.<br />Zooey Deschanel and Will Ferrell do a sweet version of &#34;Baby It's Cold Outside.&#34;<br />Cute film!!
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Its not that funnier. some times disgusting. Not worth spending $5 for HD print. wait for few more days until price get reduced to $2 or $1.
1609611543|5.0|I started the wheat free diet only 12 days ago, and i've lost 9 lbs. It is the only thing I changed.<br /><br />I've been a nothing-with-legs vegetarian for 9 months with no weight loss. Zero.<br />I spent 2 months working out 3-5 days a week for an hr. No weight loss. None.<br /><br />I still eat a moderate amount of carbohydrates and fats, so it isn't a reduction of carbs, or not eating fats. i figured it couldn't hurt. I'm about 50 lbs overweight (well, about 40 lbs now!)<br />I would not have believed it, but this seems to be doing me so much good - I can see better at night, my joints hurt less, my asthma is dramatically better.I'm gong to keep working on it. Anyone reading this, try it for four days and let me know how you do. It MIGHT BE TRUE. Reserving judgement until I've been wheat free for a year - Don't forget, it's been 50+ years of being badly nourished by wheat-rich diets. I don't expect it to get fixed instantly, but it is working so well right now.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A very honest and daring book, well-written and convincing!  I admire Mr. Alexander for sharing what many in his profession would consider to be wishful thinking.  The book was very gripping...I found it difficult to put down.  I have since recommended it to other friends who have loved it also.
B00633W614|5.0|Same as first Chronicle, looked forward to reading. Story line well developed, plot and characters fab! strongly recommend as a satisfying read
1423140605|5.0|Yes, I'm giving it five stars! I had yet to give any of the previous PJ or HoO books five stars, but I really, really enjoyed this book. Also, when I think about the fact that this is for children, it definitely deserves five stars.<br /><br />With a lot of more mature-themed YA novels that I've read recently, there's not a great amount of time where you get to laugh so much about what characters do or say or think, but I really admire the way Rick Riordan seems to know how to make people laugh. The humorous moments can be in the most inappropriate situations, but when you think about the characters, it just makes so much sense that they would pick that moment to say that specific thing or think that specific thought. I literally laughed out loud quite a bit reading this, and I appreciated it. It also relieves the tension.<br /><br />The challenges and adventures they go through are brilliant and exciting and fun, but you do sometimes get a chance to breathe as well, usually not for very long though before the next \\"situation\\" comes along, and there are tons of them.<br /><br />The new characters/gods/goddesses that they meet are always interesting because you just don't know exactly what side these characters are on. Are they for the Olympians? Or are they for Gaea? Or do they just hate demigods?<br /><br />What's really great is the interactions and the POVs from each of the seven heroes on the quest. I can honestly say that I kept having to remind myself who was Greek and who was Roman because they all just seemed to work together well enough that it didn't make a difference which side they were on. As a reader, you get the advantage of knowing each of the characters thoughts about certain situations, although sometimes that can be a little frustrating because you want them to tell the others how you feel or what you know when they don't.<br /><br />What's cool is learning these characters as they learn more about themselves and their abilities, their strengths, and even their weaknesses. You can see they're learning, but that they also still have a lot to learn as well. Especially in knowing that they need to work together and not separately, as they seem to be used to going about things through most of their lives. It's a great teaching tool that Rick has always seem to be easily able to include through his storytelling, and I admire him greatly for it.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent addition to the Heroes of Olympus collection and I definitely encourage all children to make time to read this, whether for school reading or for fun, because it works for both!and even their weaknesses.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|love this show. all the actors are well played, and the story lines are interesting.  will continue to watch as long as it is running.
0385742886|4.0|Well, this is a prequel to The Maze Runner series in every sense of the word, and the book focuses on pretty much a whole new set of people.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect. I had just finished reading the Maze Runner series, so of course my first thoughts were that this was going to be how Thomas and Teresa were involved, maybe hoping for a deeper insight to what their relationship was like before they had the swipe done on them and went into the Maze themselves.<br /><br />Instead, what we get is something very intriguing and more into how the whole Flare was started, which actually makes more sense to write about in the deeper scope of things. The Maze Runner series was never about a love triangle anyway, and James Dashner has made it so that we are keen to remember that with this story.<br /><br />The story itself is amazing. We are taken back to when the sun flares hit earth and the recent events after. And we get to see it through the eyes of a teen named Mark.<br /><br />Let me just say that I already thought James Dashner's vision of the heat-scorched earth and the people infected with The Flare was bad enough in the original series. But in this book, it just seems much more visceral and unfortunately, realistically terrifying, especially when you realize the \\"how\\" and \\"why\\" things happened.<br /><br />Even though the results of natural catastrophes are undeniably scary, the thought that, were such things as sun flares hitting earth were to happen to the extent described in this book, people's instinct to survive would cause perverse rationalizations for their actions is the true terror that Dashner has us venture into.<br /><br />It is something that the author had already revealed in the original series, but it has definitely been brought more into light in this book as well.<br /><br />I wasn't sure if I could feel for the characters as much as I felt for the ones in the original trilogy, but it seems that Dashner made it a point to condense the amount of people to focus on so you could understand them and feel for them - the anger, heartache, pain, frustration, confusion, fear, sadness - you feel it all.<br /><br />The thing about this book is that it doesn't stop. You really hardly have time to rest from one chapter to the next and you just wish it would. But I guess that's Dashner's goal, to allow you to really get an idea of what it's like to experience Mark's world. There were many times where I just wanted to hug Mark and let him laugh and play and just have fun.<br /><br />Now, I guess it's labeled for Young Adult readers probably because of the fact that it's from a teen's POV, but the story and the actions in here are very adult in its violence and its tone, more than I thought of in the original trilogy. Still, it's a great read and definitely makes you think, teens and adults alike.<br /><br />When it comes out, I highly recommend you getting your hands on a copy ASAP, but of course, only after you've read the Maze Runner series first.mount of people to focus on so you could understand them and feel for them - the anger, heartache, pain, frustration, confusion, fear, sadness - you feel it all.<br /><br />The thing about this book is that it doesn't stop.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|works as it said it would use on my S3 and Galaxy tab with no issues! Keep them coming ,
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Great game! Unfortunately I am losing sleep over it. One suggestion, tell us what the little ball does. Also keep your final rank visible a little longer.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|Reminds me of Mario and Rayman, lots of fun and kind of addicting. works great on the phone,Hard to stop!!
B009SJ46EA|4.0|Whether you like season two or not depends on what you are expecting and what you like. I thought season one was reasonably good, exceptional at times with amazing performances throughout. I'm not big into horror so I didn't have high expectations. What was wonderful (and what I thought the show was really about) was the human drama of a family that has become unglued, the shame, remorse and sense of losing oneself that Ben Harmon experiences. Good horror will transcend supernatural scares and delve into deeper emotion and this show succeeds in this regard. The scene where Violet encounters her own dead body should be terrifying but instead the creators (and incredible actress who plays Violet) transcend terrifying to create a scene that is unspeakably sad. Well done.<br /><br />Season two is more classic horror (so far). I reserve judgement because I have only seen one episode. Thus far there is no real present-day drama that is compelling (don't know about anybody else but I could care less about the annoying, horny newlyweds). The plot threads are scattered and plentiful and thus far the show lacks the genuine and compelling human drama that was present in the first show. But hey, I only watched one episode. I think it has potential if character and plot arcs are developed. Thus far I'm not terribly impressed with anything other than the performances but I'm hopeful more compelling emotional plot arcs will emerge. If you love horror and scares purely for the sake of scary you'll probably love it. That's not my bag so much so I'm hoping something deeper will emerge.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer. Very good read - not his best but good plot and good lead character. I felt there were some minor breaks in the plot.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Easy to use and looks just like the web version.  I don't think I was able to remove a connection from here though.
B0017O1MIM|4.0|The moview is briliant and the restoration beyond expectation. I however, did have difficulty playing the 2 extra blue ray discs on my LG blue ray disc player.
B007IL5D3S|5.0|Another gripping story in the Mitch Rapp series. I am a Mitch Rapp fan even though the stories follow a predictable pattern and I have so far always found them to be an enjoyable read.
B009ZE27US|1.0|i scanned my finger I'm 11it said I was49 then I tried it on my sister shes 12 it said she was 73!!! cant believe this app it just picks some random #that doesn't make sence
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This is the worst game ever made! Their is much better games of the same type out there! precision gaming in a very inaccurate game!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Cant say enough about these games. Im the type that has to get all the stars on every level. My whole family loves them all
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are the lightest, old-school, over-the-head ear buds around. WalMart sold them for years then they suddenly disappeared I guess cause they are not hip. Bit if you can't stand regular ear buds, particularly for running, these are great. And they are cheap. And they last.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Every one of the Angry birds are great. They are even better on a bigger screen. My 2yr old absolutely adores Angry birds & laughs every time he plays it
B009KS4XRO|5.0|LOVE IT!! It is so exciting to play and level up!!  But watch out it is VERY addicting. Be prepared.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Cant get enough of this game. Would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenge. Keeps your mind working. Even my little ones love it.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|very nice case. it looks and feels like a real book. it is just a cover and has no stand. but it is quality
B006PHD0RW|5.0|My whole family loves this game. So funny to see the produce & how it reacts with the other stuff.
B00A757EFW|5.0|this a good game it is classic and fun you should get it you get to eat stuff and you could be a girl one.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|Love the game dont get me wrong I have it on my ipod touch, so I bought it on my kindle fire for a bigger screen, but it constantly glitches out, most of the time it wont load at all saying it has an internal error try again later.
B005LAIH4A|1.0|i received this dvd along with a group of other dvds that I had ordered.  Last night, when my grand daughter came over, I wanted to show her this film.  I tore the plastic wrap from the package and the package was empty.  You need to replace this for me,  I guess that sometimes, the factory makes mistakes.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|We love all of the Criminal Minds seasons. We have watched all of them leading up to this one and they have not disappointed!
B0038P59A0|4.0|Enjoyed seeing a dfferent depiction of Sherlock Holmes- exciting and funny and full of suspense. This portrayal of Holmes and Watson stay close to the novels.<br />Some scenes of women inappropriate of young boys, but overall a decent family movie.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|I have read all of the Jo Nesbo books and this one is my least favorite.  I found it disjointed and a little difficult to follow.  It is narrated by a dead charactor so that the backstory filled in very slowly.  I found some of it predictable (which I have not<br />encountered in his other books.) And the end was disappointing on several levels.  All in all I wish it had been a better read.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|This set was given to me as a gift.  My daughter loves it so much that I decided to get her a set of her own DVD's.
B009P0VLGI|5.0|I love t.A.T.u. I have been a fan of them since I was about 10yrs old :)<br />The remixes are absolutely AMAZING!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The movie was one of the best action movies I've ever seen. I had some minor issues with the streaming that reduced the picture quality part way through the movie. All in all I was very satisfied.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|My kids loved it and so did I!  The characters were wonderful and very believable.  The kids starring in this movie were fantastic!!
1938469003|4.0|This is a fun read.  It's good on a lot of history.  Some complain that it doesn't have a lot of focus on the new american IPA's but I think that is really it's own book.<br /><br />If you want to brew an IPA this is a key reference.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I really liked this album.  It had a nice variety of songs, my personal favorite being &#34;Kill your Heroes.&#34; This album was a good mix of different types of music.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|I bought the movie, which I rarely do, after i saw it last summer in the theater.  This is a classic I'm going to go back to year after year.<br /><br />Obvious warning:  swearing, sexual innuendo, drug topics are in this movie.  This is not your average teddy bear.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great collection of bluray movies. The quallity of the video is great, the package is pretty nice an the movies... everybody loves Nolan´s  work on the dark knight. The bonus boklet is a nice detail also, filled with production photos.
B000002GYR|5.0|This is a great CD.  This was purchased as a  five and It was a great price and it arrived very quickly.'
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Long time since i had the &#34;gotta&#34;  hit me (gotta know what happens next). Looking forward to the next block of read time&#62;
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|A lot of different factors play into what is considered a good movie.  Mood, time of day, storyline and even price.  For $3.99 you can't go wrong renting this movie.  Is a good sci fi and different enough from the original that they could have titled it something else.  If you like action, high tech equipment and hot chicks in tight futuristic clothes, watch this movie.
B00364K6YW|5.0|It came in the condition expected and of course I've already seen the movie a million times so I knew I would love it.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The action was good and the story line was decent but the ending was completely pinched, right when it was getting good.  I could have waited for this one to be on the movie channels and saved my money.
B00280LYIM|5.0|You won't believe how awesome this book is! This time Percy goes in a maze that is almost impossible to navigate in! Grover even finds Pan!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a great book to describe what a dog might be thinking. The storyline a bit sad, but, definitely makes you think about what your dog is thinking and doing as you leave for work/school each day. Extremely touching.
B00280LYHS|5.0|In this book of this series Percy Jackson and friends save Olympus! Sadly, but it was for the best, Luke dies
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|The Duchess War is the first full length novel in Courtney Milan's Brothers Sinister series, and a story that I've been looking forward to. Having read The Governess Affair, the prequel to this story, and having read the epilogue that sets up this book, I knew that what was to come would be an wonderful, emotional read, but this... it was so much more than I had hoped for.<br /><br />Let me get this said right up front. This book is brilliant. The way Ms. Milan writes historical romances, the way she uses the ridiculous social standards of the times to not only hinder her characters but to make them triumphant - yes. Brilliant.<br /><br />When I first began reading historical romances, I thought things like the ton, peerage, seasons, the need to marry well... I thought they were all silly things, a bunch of hogwash made up by authors to flesh out their stories. But then, as I did more research of this on my own, I discovered that not only was it not hogwash, it was often far worse than historical romance portrays it. So when I read books like The Governess Affair and The Duchess War, and knowing that this was a reality of the times, I find I become very emotionally attached to the... lessers. The Underdogs. Those who don't fit and will never fit regardless of the kinds of people they are. It doesn't matter how much good they do, how many lives they might save, or how they treat others. They would never fit. And yet there were those who took up more space than they were worth, but were welcomed wherever they went... it all seemed so unfair. So hopeless.<br /><br />But not the way Ms. Milan tells the story.<br /><br />The Duchess War is a story of right and wrong. Of honor - and not just honor when it's convenient. It's being a person of high integrity, no matter the cost. It's also a beautiful romance. And not just about discovering love and holding on to it with every single thing you are - more importantly, it's about being worthy of that love.<br /><br />Robert and Minnie are such compelling characters, and had they been real people, I would truly believe that their chance meeting was destiny giving them a hand. They're so very opposite from one another, but alike in the ways that matter. Both flawed, emotionally scarred people who recognized that in one another, and that's what drew them together. Were they perfect? No! They were human! There were times I was angry with Robert, times I was livid with Minnie, but in the end, I came to adore them both. And that's all that matters.<br /><br />The bottom line: Courtney Milan never ceases to amaze me with her stories that are witty, clever, intelligent, sexy and so very romantic. She's one of very few auto-buy authors on my list, one of the few whose stories I am guaranteed to love, and books like those found in The Brothers Sinister series are why.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and pick up the novella, The Governess Affair and this story, The Duchess War and settle in for two of the most delightful, poignant, lovely romances you'll likely ever read.<br /><br />My sincerest thanks to Ms. Milan for sending me a copy of this book in exchange for sharing my honest thoughts with you. It was a true pleasure, start to finish.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Being in the games once was hard enough but being in there twice and then being shown as a rebel to lead a cause finds Katniss with a bigger job to do.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app to feel spiritually connected while on the go. Being able to have access to the bible at all times is a must, especially in the world we are living in now.
B0091MW4QG|5.0|This is a pretty nice intro to the Box set and it gives you some idea of the production and vocal values of some of the operas. I wish we could have seen more of the lesser known opera like Alzira, I Masnadieri etc. instead of the old war horses which have many different DVD's available.<br /><br />Just from seeing this single DVD I can honestly say that the box set is NOT worth buying - some of the individual operas are - especially ones like Alzira - but most of the War Horses are available in better productions with famous singers.<br /><br />These operas are all set in small provincial opera houses and some of the staging is minimalist at best. The Il Trovatore staging was not only awful but so was the singing. I didn't got for the White Bed, Candles and Red Moon for Di Quella Pira. I suggest if you want that opera get either the Met version with Pavarotti or the TDK with Domingo. Both are better sung, and the Domingo is the well stages - the Met is pretty poor staging.<br /><br />The Ernani is poor - not just the staging but the singers - if you want this opera, get the Met version with Pavarotti.<br /><br />Nevertheless for all my criticims and saying there are better DVD's of the individual operas out there - getting this single DVD will give you some idea of which operas you might want to buy invididually in this series or from other labels with better singers and productions.<br /><br />But above all this DVD indicates that the BOX Set at $700+ dollars is not worth it since many of the operas are poorly staged and have at best B+ singers.
B006XF5BTG|1.0|The info in this book was sound advice.  However, the author alienates a huge section of his audience right off the bat by repeatedly stating \\"trainers are worthless, trainers know nothing\\" etc.<br /><br />Please understand that many trainers.  do continue to educate themselves and advance their knowledge.  Although the advice in this book is reasonable, the presentation of that advice is inflammatory and unprofessional.  And yes, I have been a full time trainer for over 10 years.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|They did a great job of interlacing this story with the original Bourne movies.  Definitely created a future for the series!

B004K4AVAG|5.0|Best Album from HER yet. Keep up the Good work Lady Gaga. Mad props to you, thank you. Looking forward to you keeping us entertained.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie was wonderful.  Bill Murray and Frances McDormand were great and the two young actors were excellent.  Appropriate for young teens through the elderly.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read this and other reviews at [...]<br /><br />This will be the shortest review I'll ever write, and it'll probably be redundant and I'll use the word \\"amazing\\" too many times. I won't even include quotes, because honestly I WANT TO GIVE NOTHING AWAY! That's just what this book does to me. There's not much to say about this book other than it will change your life. I'm not sure if I'll even make sense. In fact, let's plan on me not. I can only hope though, that you'll take away one thing from this review - buying the book, and seeing for yourself. I had the pleasure of reading Hopeless early, and everyday since finishing reading it, I've thought about it and sometimes revisited it. The story of Sky and Holder will grab you, suck you in, and will not let you go. Ever.<br /><br />I love Colleen's writing. Slammed and Point of Retreat are two of my favorite books and she has an amazing way of pulling you in to the lives of her characters. She makes you feel. Makes you believe you're them. And you're living their lives. This couldn't have been more accurate in regards to Hopeless. Hello Holder. Wanna get married and have fictional babies when you're done with Sky? Our celebrity name can be Madder or Holdison. You pick.<br /><br />Another unforgettable aspect of this story is the fact that it came from someone's brain in the first place. It's not your usual dramatic, sexy new adult read. There are so many layers. Just when you think you've peeled them all back and you know what's going to happen, another layer starts bubbling...and then you're left yelling \\"WHAT THE HELL?!\\" no really. That happened to me. Many times.<br /><br />If there was a ever a story that I would DEMAND everyone read, it'd be this one. It will demand your attention and take over your life. In the end, though, you'll be better for it. It's dark. Sometimes very dark. The plus side is that I've never seen someone mix the light with the dark so well. It's a real story. It makes you feel.<br /><br />Hopeless is absolutely a 5 star read for me, and if you weren't already completely impressed with Colleen Hoover, you're sure to be after reading this. It only makes me more excited to see what else she has stewing and gooing in that brain of hers. I'm sure it's nothing short of amazing, though.<br /><br />Because Colleen is just that awesome, she's offered to include a SIGNED paperback giveaway as part of my review. I.could.just.kiss.her.face. Really, too, I'm jealous of whoever wins. I want the prize. #amiallowedtowinacontestihost?<br /><br />NOTE: This title is NOT in the same genre as Colleen's previous two books! It's important to note that Hopeless includes much more mature subject matter and is not YA! Thanks! :), and if you weren't already completely impressed with Colleen Hoover, you're sure to be after reading this.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I regret spending the money and did not enjoy myself at all.  I would recommend watching something different or doing something remotely useful.
B00735HGQ6|3.0|The journey taken with the protagonist on foot and through time, with a surprise ending, which further endears him and his wife with the reader.
B007Q476KU|5.0|Great sprawling story with our &#34;War Horse&#34; as the centerpiece.  Fairly family-friendly with the exception of some (war) violence.  Guess you might've guessed that from the title eh?
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I'm a big fan of GG, and have followed the series since the beginning. After a somewhat disappointing seasons 4 and 5, I was 'over' the show. However, season 6 was much better and tied up a lot of loose ends - and wow, what a finale! Bittersweet to see the show end, but I enjoyed the ride!
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Lame story --- bad production values  -- all in all not a very professionally produced movie. Would never recommend it
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This book wasn't as great as the first two books but it was still good. I would recommend reading the whole series.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|It was too crass/vulgar. There were a couple genuinely funny parts, but it counted on its vulgarity to get too many of its laughs, which unfortunately seems to work for a lot of people these days. That made it disappointing to me.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I love the music and i was glade i could find it available for a reasonable price. awesome purchase, if you love the killers, this album is easy 10/10. on every level
B0060D196K|5.0|As a reading specialist, I read the original story to my students and ask them to make mental images of the text to help with their understanding of the story.  I then use this version of A Christmas Carol to provide them with an opportunity to do a compare and contrast with someone else's interpretation of the text.  I found this version to do a good job of following the story line.
0857860801|5.0|My son loves the YouTube videos of this cartoon cat. I ordered this book as part of his Christmas. It came in plenty of time. The book was brand new as advertized. The little I read was in keeping with the series. I am sure he will love it!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is Sanderson at his best, telling an entertaining story with complex, fascinating characters and, of course, a unique and intriguing magic system.  Highly recomended!
B002RKSZS0|5.0|I enjoy reading Jane Austen's books.  I thought this one was very interesting and not your usual Austen story.  The ending was a bit abrupt, but it was still satisfying.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Interesting, but I don't need as much info. about getting to her &#34;office&#34; - what she sees along the way, streets, buildings, etc.  The plot really doesn't  get going until a third of the way into the book.....Alot of extraneous material and not enough story....Could have been much better as the idea is great, but I found it to be rather a yawner....
B000JQUHLM|4.0|I didn't know that there was more to the Pollyanna story than the original book.  This was a surprise find!  I thought it was pleasant to read because I like old-fashioned stories that offer characters I can like.  When I read for pleasure, I don't necessarily want to read about modern-day realities.  This fit the bill nicely.
B001O03NCW|5.0|I love this soundtrack and I think I'm not alone. The spinoff albums were not as good as the original one. Great music to enjoy.
B00881VLCE|5.0|plenty of  puzzles for people to chose from. you can either buy or pick from free ones. it is nice that ,magic puzzle give you that
B005LAIISU|1.0|This is one of a couple movies that come in Blu-ray and no option to be coupled with a standard DVD as well.  I started purchasing Blu-ray movies for the home, but I have to make sure it had the standard DVD with it as well for car travel or watching on my laptop. I don't have a tablet that the digital download would assist with nor is it compatible with my car DVD player.  As a side note, the only times my kids (both under 9 yo) get to see DVD's in the car is if we are travelling more than 2 or 3 hours.,  Otherwise they have books and toys to amuse themselves with or do the normal brotherly sisterly fight with each other thing too.<br />I will gladly spend an extra few dollars buying the Blu-ray/DVD/Download set every time over having to choose between just getting the DVD because it works on my Blu-ray at home and in my car.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|its got more then i need for a alarm clock,  but for a free app it work just fine.  i would say use it if you rare look for a free app.
B009F879HK|5.0|What is there to say.  A classic song, re-released as close to the original as possible.  A nostalgic piece of music that warrants listening to.  Highly recommended.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Should be required watching for everyone in public office.  In order for us to accomplish great things, cooperation is a must
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is what an action/superhero movie should be.<br /><br />great story arc, well developed characters and solid writing. and of course lots of action liberally spread throughout the movie.<br /><br />there is a theme hammered home time and again throughout that keeps the movie moving and focused which is generally lacking in other superhero/action flicks<br /><br />if you have not seen this movie yet, i ask why not?&#62;
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I read this in one day and that's with my one year old and three year old boys to take care of too! Wonderful fast read!
B00632HWOG|2.0|The change in view was not well received, and though one could opt out of it at one point, not any longer.  Plus, the fact that you are bombarded by its liberally tainted, lamestream media news - and if I saw one more article about the kardashians, I'll scream (along w/ most of America).  Needs to play to the middle of the road, not the left.  Yahoo is no longer my main email.
0689842449|5.0|A fabulous collection for the introctory of what happens to a seed and how it becomes a flower. Not all the seeds make it and it describes incidents of the ones that do not and the one special little one that did.
B005ZUR724|2.0|The game itself is amazing for a mobile MMO. However, Kindle Fire is always last to get updates. New update came out almost 3 days ago and it still isn't available to Kindle users. Not to mention Aneroid as a whole is 3 updates behind Apple. Gameloft needs to pay more attention to Aneroid before the game dies off.
072325804X|5.0|The item is exactly as described. I highly recommend this seller. A classic tale for the very young. Any child would love this added to their collection.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Same old same old. Like the Jeff Cory character..BUT..come  on!!! how many times can i read the same book. DE Mille come up with some new ideas. It's an OK read..but I couldn't wait till I finished it so that I could start reading another book. Skip it. A bit boring.  Janet  B.
0399246665|5.0|Highly recommend this author and this set in particular. A great introctory set for the very young. small enough for them to hold and read themselves.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|While this book had been perceived in general as being merely an erotic book, after reading and understanding the characters, it most certainly is a romance. The author, quite precisely, delves in to paint these specific characters. They all have a specific personality and the author has a mind blowing ability to portray the characters' feelings. With that said, this is a romance in which two people happen upon each other, fall in love and in the process of their lives intertwining to become one, many issues from the past that have been in the dark come to light. I was also very pleased with the level of vocabulary that was incorporated and appreciative of the vividly painted scenes...with words of course. All of this is jam packed in a few 500 pg books so naturally it is not a story you will want to put down.
B009SIE6AA|5.0|My husband and I both are avid James Taylor fans.  We love this album and have been playing it repeatedly.
B009VB97EY|3.0|A good movie to watch for the heck if it. Have a beer. No decent plot and not enough naked men dancing around in my opinion :)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked this book. However, I think John Grisham has written better novels -- I've read them all and I recommend this one to those who enjoy a good book, but the ending was vague.<br /><br />Barbara Godina
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The characters in this book are smart and lovable teenagers. For that reason I found it slightly unrealistic, but it is a truly wonderful read nonetheless. The topics are cancer and love, and at times the story is quite sad, but it is more often tongue-in-cheek and delightfully sarcastic (it is narrated by a teenage girl). Highly recommended for adults and young adults. You'll probably learn some new vocabulary from these teens, such as 'hamartia.'
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have to say this may be my favorite of the series so far! If you are a fan of the previous four books from the series, you will love this!!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Downloaded the Facebook app for the Kindle and iPad.  Kindle version very limited on settings.  The standard font was so small I had to use a magnifying glass to read it and after several hours of researching I was unable to find a way to correct this.  Also the pictures on the news feed in Facebook didn't resize and filled the entire screen.  Made it very difficult to scroll through the news feed or my wall.  Unfortunately this being a major app for me, I don't see the Kindle as a viable tablet either then.
B007N8RULO|3.0|Spider solitaire is a great game, It's challenging and fun.  Sadly, the ads add a great deal fo frustration to the gaming experience.  Do yourself a favor and buy the ad-free app.
0547564651|5.0|To be or not to be successful? I found that between 'How Children Succeed' and [[ASIN:B00AP63CHC The 6 Pillars of Academic Success]] whether or not students will have a successful future depends much upon qualities such as courtesy and self-discipline, not to mention the ability to focus. Great for all with children, and even for adults who are thinking about/currently studying in school. Quick. Informative. Recommended.
B00003CXA2|4.0|Still do not understand Amazon's policy of not separating reviews of Standard DVDs from downloaded streaming movies from Blu Ray DVDs.  They should all be separated even if it demands more effort and work of the Amazon employees.<br /><br />There is much discussion elsewhere on this film in terms of plot summary, meaning, and value so I won't get into that. My reviews are strictly regarding the transfer from Standard Definition to Blu Ray. I did not have the Standard Def version so this is not a comparison between the two.<br /><br />The video transfer was completely free of any artifacting, stair stepping or aliasing.  The overall image was a touch soft without that hard edged video look typical of many current films.  While there was no noticeable grain, the soft appearance did not interfere with the warm color grading and imaging throughout the film.  While not deserving of video 'DEMO status', the video transfer was quite good.<br /><br />The audio transfer is DTS HD 5.1 and was nicely spread across the front stage.  There is some nice panning to the discreets but not very much through most of the film.  The only time your audio system will come to life, especially your sub channel, is during the wartime explosion scenes.  Even then there is very little use of the discreet rear channels being  used for anything other than general ambience rather than discreet foley fx.  Never the less, the  lossless audio is nicely balanced and dialogue clear.  It should be noted that in  the beginning of the film I had to turn the volume up past where I normally set it for most films.  This tells me that the audio levels during editing were set lower than most and once I  boosted my own audio level, all was fine and dandy.<br /><br />Since I do not have the Standard Def version I can't make a recommendation that this is better than the Standard Def.  However, the Sapphire Series of BluRay DVDs generally boast of greatly improved mastering of a film to Blu Ray so my guess is that making the move from your SD version to this Blu Ray would be a major upgrade, especially so for the video transfer.  This is because soft focus films like this generally produce more noticeable grain in SD than BR.<br /><br />I didn't have time to watch all the extras, and there are a great many, but I did watch the 6 or 7 screen tests which were very enjoyable and charming.  I would rather have more screen tests on discs than those wasteful previews of other movies that we see far too often and cause us to pay for a company's advertisements rather than improved BR imaging.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thankst making the move from your SD version to this Blu Ray would be a major upgrade, especially so for the video transfer.

B000ARFNNM|4.0|I am rating this movie based on my past experience viewing it.  I was unable to watch the DVD I received as it gave the message that it could not be played in my region.  I have returned it to the supplier with a request that it be replaced with<br />a suitable DVD as this was intended to be a Christmas gift.  Although I returned the DVD more than a week ago, I have yet to hear from them.  Needless to say, at this point I am quite disatisfied.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game and the way it kept changeing tasks.  I have won the game and thinking of starting it over to do again.
B000FC1MCS|3.0|This was a good read. It wasn't great but it certainly wasn't bad. Good for times when you just have a little free time on your hands and don't want to get into something you know you can't put down.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Since it doesn't really follow any particular person it makes it hard to care for any of them but had some really good zombie action.
0547884591|4.0|Ferriss has done it again. In &#34;The 4-Hour Chef&#34; Ferriss has found a way to make the complex simple and fun. I have tried a number of the recipes in his book and his simplified approach to cooking is just what I need, being a bit of a novice myself. I especially appreciate that the recipes mesh with his 4-Hour Body slow carb diet.<br /><br />So why not 5 stars for this book? First, there is a lot of material that has been rehashed and reprinted from the 4HB. For example, there is a section in this book about a particular work out plan that is lifted right form the 4HB. Second, while Ferriss is great at simplifying and distilling down information and processes to their essentials, there is almost always a catch. One example of this is the recipe for Osso Bucco (sp?). He promises to teach you how to make this gourmet meal in 15 minutes, but you come to find out that it is a little different from the dish as prepared in a restaurant. Is it still good? Sure it is. But it seems like there are some shortcuts he takes that, while not really dishonest might be seen as misleading in how he pitches them.<br /><br />These complaints aside, the book is very informative and well worth the purchase price.

B005GSZZ1A|3.0|The story of Shin was very good, but the writer gives you a complete hostory lesson of North Korea that takes about 28% of the book....
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This movie is so cute.  It's one of those that I was so impressed by that I wish I could go back and watch it again for the first time.  I wish I had bought it instead of rented it.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Reminds you of the amazing, award winning scores of the Lord of the Rings trilogy with some stand out pieces that distinguish it as its own work. Spectacular.
1451627297|5.0|Wow what a fun ride reading this book! I can't believe I have left it on my night stand for over a year before I finally picked it up. It is a long read but I enjoy every word of it and such a great story that I don't want it ever to end. It's one of the best novels I have read over the years - A story about time travel with a real history as background, JFK assassination. Stephen Kind did his research to make this book happen and you can feel the authenticity in the book supported by every bit of history. Even though it's a fiction it feels so real that everything seems to be happening before my eyes, and I have found myself actually believing the whole story.<br /><br />A masterpiece by Stephen King and simply unputdownable! I would've have given it 10 stars if I could!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Not as good as Season 1, but still pretty dang good! I like the idea of bringing actors back from Season 1.
B007T99ENE|5.0|I'm so glad that I'm reading Sweet tooth, as after Solar, I was a bit disappointed and didn't want to read McEwan anymore, but Sweet tooth made me change my mind. McEwan's language is always magnificient so it's worth reading anything written by him, just to enjoy good reading, but Sweet tooth isn't only good language, it's everything in one book.
B005SNP6FS|4.0|If you like movies like Snatch, In Bruges and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells be sure to check this one out too.  Both lead characters turn in excellent performances.
B0095R76EW|4.0|Not gona lie, I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but it was movie night with the wife so I was stuck. All in all thought it was actually pretty good, if you're a Jason Segel from How I Met Your Mother fan or Forgetting Sarah Marshall, then this is right there. Worth a shot if you're looking for a happy feel good movie.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is about a young man living in Toronto who falls for an American newly-moved-to-Toronto girl named Ramona Flowers. In order to date her (and live), he has to defeat her seven evil exes in battle.<br /><br />This movie (and, of course, the graphic novels) is the realization of something I personally had always thought would make a good story, but never thought I would see: Video game tropes set in the real world. Having read the graphic novels, I thought I would be disappointed by the film, but I was oh so very surprised to fall instantly in love with it. I'm not even a big Michael Cera fan, but I adored him! The care taken to make every character look like the drawn character was amazing. I know they had to cut out so much, but the cuts made sense. I had a few tiny issues with the pacing, but those couldn't be helped. The best performance, in my opinion, is the woman who plays Knives. The scene where she colors her hair blue is one of the best in the entire film.<br /><br />It's the characters and the details that make this film what it is. There are big names in roles of all sizes (Chris Evans as Lucas Lee, Mae Whitman as Roxy, to name a few), but each cast member put so much effort into his/her character. The coins - oh those coins - that erupt when an ex is defeated; the level up points; the nega Scott; the censoring of the f word; all those things add up.<br /><br />Seriously. If you like quirky films, go watch this movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Simply put, this series is amazing. It's not 'B' movie fluff but a deep look at people and what we are capable of. If you like Battlestar Galactica Revised and Lost you will understand. It's not about the spaceship, the Island or in this case the Walkers (zombies) its about the people so I urge you to watch  this film. This is not a horror show any more than any 'war' is. Allthough this series has extreamly good life lesson to teach I do not recommed this for kids (shame).
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|it was a cute movie but i expected a little better. I'd wait until it's free on cable. It may make you chuckle, but, honestly - wait.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I so love this app! From weekly meals to craft projects to things to just make you giggle - it's my go-to for EVERYTHING!
1401225756|5.0|Why are you even reading this review right now? This book is simply amazing and I loved every page of it!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is all I use now for an alarm clock. I love the features and ease of use. I use the timer for cooking and reminders. great ap
B006MW3V6U|2.0|I find that I'm severely underwhelmed by Downton Abbey. As much as I like many of the actors/actresses in the cast, the writing is average at best and the characters too variable and inconsistent to sustain an engaging drama. Part of this is due to the fact that the creators cannot commit to the defining parameters. Is this a soap opera or is it a serious drama? The two are mutually exclusive genres.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover has done it again. Another beyond awesome book!!! Hopeless has you feeling every emotion through this amazing story. I couldn't put the book down until the very last word. I highly recommend reading this book!!!!!
B009NQKPUW|1.0|First it starts at a 1 star. Then up to a 2 star. Then the movie almost edges to a 3 star. And plop, you hit your rear on a 1 star movie. Just been taken for a fool folks, and it doesn't feel good. WAY TO GO HOLLYWOOD!!!REHAB WORKS FOR DIRECTORS.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Story line of this movie was girly but over all it was a funny movie.<br /><br />Best part is the fight scene.<br /><br />Major props to Mark for being able to rattle off all of those names like that.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Too expensive for what is really one book cut into three. I will not buy these trilogies anymore at these prices.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I just had to get it as a Christmas present for a friend!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Too expensive for what is really one book cut into three. I will not buy these trilogies anymore at these prices.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Good movie for folks of a certain age. I would recommend it to friends. fht mno tyu rtry hfffy hhh.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I enjoyed the Trilogy, however, alot of the same old sexual language and got tiring with that, but would have liked more story line action. Still I enjoyed reading.  One other point about these Trilogy books coming out, it is too expensive paying $30 for ebook to what is really one book cut in three.  Not a fan of these and will stop buying books that are trilogies.  None of them are read alone books, so I think if you want to publish these, you should make it one price for all three and more reasonable.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Highly recommend this show.  Jessica Lange is so great. I love how the use same actors from season 1 with new characters. Different and compelling.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have never read a book as bad as this one!! And because I was traveling I thought I'd buy the trilogy and did so...and now I have two brand new books I will never read! Horrible read!
0439882826|5.0|My nephew LOVED this book!  A friend of mine had told me about it and found it on Amazon.  Fast delivery, packaged excellent, just like its described!  I will do business here again!!  Thank you so much!
B000TERDHA|5.0|LCD Soundsystem is a band that reminds me a lot of Oingo Boingo! I love artists that are brave enough to explore the edges of music.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Gives a warm Christmas feeling and and a sensible lesson. I don't think to uninstall.loved the A Christmas Carol. GOOD BOOK
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Very disappointed in this book. Character development was non-existent.  I sure would have enjoyed learning more about the Panther and what made him tick, instead of how he was to be eliminated. This is has to be one of Nelson  DeMille's worse efforts; it seems as though he just dictated it and spent no time developing it. This is a very bad suspense book.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|Def. give this one a try.  It's very entertaining and well done!  The acting is great, and the guy who plays Bella's father in Twilight (Charlie) is in it in a VERY different role.  :-)
B000PDZHDM|5.0|This David O. Selznick film is a remake of an earlier film with the same name. Ingrid also played in this one so it is easy to get them mixed-up at first.<br /><br />The story is a classic and has been told in many ways. A famous violinist (Leslie Howard) falls in love with his daughter's piano teacher (Ingrid Bergman). Unlike many movies where the couple cause each other trouble and force the other one to beg his/her way back into good graces, the situations are real enough that you feel that you are part of the story. You will have to watch to find out how they deal with feelings and act on them.<br /><br />You can easily get wrapped up in the story and forget that there is quit a bit of beautiful music in this film.<br /><br />If you find this movie as intriguing as I do, your next story should be &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; - Criterion Collection (1945). See my review &quot;When you feel like British, no other film will do as well.&quot; May 6, 2001<br /><br />[[ASIN:0780023420 Brief Encounter - Criterion Collection]]
B003TOMAPC|4.0|It's definitely got an edge!  NOT your typical super-hero movie, or typical in ANY way for that matter.  Quite original and fun.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|A lot of these games tend to be garbage, or easy to get bored with. This game is thoroughly well-designed and enjoyable. My two daughters (ages 5 and 7) both enjoy it immensely, as does my wife. I respect the quality and replay value of this game, and put it up there with other great apps like angry birds and plants vs. zombies.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Watch the first two and forget this on was made. I don't care how much money this movie made it is just a very bad movie when compared with the others. Maybe they didn't think they had to try.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Great visuals and promise but thin plot line and substance; very basic and overdone SF baseline; over theatrical; stereotypical<br />characters; pandering to audience. A let down from the previous opus work 'Aliens&#34; series.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My grandson and I love this game. A great way for a four year old to learn critical thinking. Love the graphics
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This film is warm, human, honest, and funny with some lessons to notice, as well as visually pleasing.<br />The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a winner.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This has to be the best first person shooter on the amazon app store!!! Also there is a Gore option so for all you concerned parents it&acute;s a great game!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's lots of fun. A bit more challenging. Worth the download. Keeps me busy waiting for appointments.Good for alll ages.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have an awakened understanding to appreciate the small stuff!  It's not a book about cancer...it's a book about life!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is a fun game to play.  I can play it in the dark and not disturb anyone.  The other game I played, the cards would float around and would not  stay where I put them.
B00935KWWO|5.0|I LOVE it! Smooth interface. Vibrant colors and appearance. A little time consuming during the initial setup, but well worth it! AND free!
B009LRE040|5.0|It is by far the best Batman trilogy, but this one is not as good as the second installment.  It is as good or better than the Batman Begins.<br /><br />Heath Ledger will never be able to be out-done as the Joker - rest his soul.<br /><br />Christian Bale was made for this part.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Glad to see this app available to  Amazon app store and Google Play. You can customize what news you want to receive and it<br />updates serval times a day to keep you informed. Some of the pictures are a little distorted on Kindle HD but app works fine on<br />Kindle and android phone. Has just about every news option - Business, Tech, Entertainment etc.. all in one app !
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect for on the go calculations! Also has a few fancy buttons! Works good, no freezing or problems. : o )
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I used to watch this when I was a kid. My son loves it too now. Can't believe anyone would rate it under five stars.
1449410243|2.0|I usually love cartoons but this came off very juvenile.  The drawings were crude and so was the humor. I do not recommend this at all.
B0020EK4QY|5.0|We had this one but wanted a Blu-Ray.  So glad we added to our video library.  This is an awesome full of action Movie.
B000J10ERO|4.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />Superman Returns (2006) is a solid Superman movie sequel.  I saw it in the theater when it came out.  The original Superman movies with Christopher Reeve were good (at least the first two were).  While I don't think Superman Returns has quite the depth of these movies as far as story, plot, and characters, I consider it a pretty good movie.  Kevin Spacey was good as Lex Luthor.  I thought Brandon Routh did very well as Clark Kent/Superman.  He looks so much like Reeve in this movie.  Some people say he gave too many nods to Christopher Reeve, but whatever.  I didn't care for Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane.<br /><br />It was great to see Eva Marie Saint in this movie.  It was also great seeing Frank Langella.<br /><br />I've never been a big fan of Superman in general (comic books, movies, etc.).  To me, Superman is just some immortal guy who has super powers.  He's a character that's harder for people to relate to compared to, say, Batman.  Batman is mortal and he trained to learn his fighting techniques.  He's easier to relate to.<br /><br />I recommend seeing Superman Returns.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|movie is funny and cute i love when ted beat mark up lol l watched on amazon streaming and now i wanna buy blu ray :)
B0086700CM|4.0|its a great game but after you get all the stuff it gets really boring. Subway surfer is takeing over anyway
B000P0J09W|5.0|This movie has been among my favorites for over a decade. It's great every time! I give it a high rating because it is great for all ages and has the perfect balance of comedy, surprise, and action.
B004GYY714|5.0|It's wonderful to have access to local radio without a traditional radio device.  Highly recomment this app.  I haven't been able to access any of the scanners, but I don't think it's the app malfunctioning.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|It was entertaining.  The book was much better and a lot of what made the book so good was left out of the movie or simply couldn't be translated to film in a way that had the same impact as the book.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|what mastery of language! what an unexpected and difficult-to-figure-out -without -help kind of book.  that's a challenge! so i confess that i looked for help and after an explanation concerning the lack of normal progression in the timeline of the story, i proceeded to enjoy the use of  language appropriate to the time of each tale in the longer story.  and what a story! gripping, funny appalling and throughout, remarkable richness of expression, never a repetition. i found it a difficult story to comprehend, in the beginning, but after receiving some help, i thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|Looks like a Legacy is not a good thing to leave after all, just another Hollywood lazy attempt to extort money and provide nothing in return.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WAITED SO LONG TO PUT THIS ONE OUT. THIS IS THE ONLY KIND OF STUFF THE ROLLING STONES SHOULD BE PUTTING OUT ANY MORE. COME ON NOW LETS GET BACK TO THEIR ROOTS  !!!!
0240808452|5.0|The book was actually recommended by a friend who is a digital artist for gaming. When I read the tips and started utilizing them in my drawings I saw a huge improvement in a relatively short period of time. I wish I would have been taught his way at looking at the human figure years ago. A definite must have for any artist's library.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|i don't have many zz top c.d.'s but this one is my favorite  :) just can't beet it.. and great price too.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This book did somewhat keep you in suspense.  Reminded me of a movie or something that I had seen or read before.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is my favorite movie for the year. No, movie have I seen this year did or could see can beat it. The music alone got me to watch it over and over again. I thought it would just be the standard movie of a group of people who stand around and sing. But it's not that!!! No, it's not another Glee show, it's wayyy funnier and the music is much better.<br /><br />What they did in this movie is sing many songs together all at once. It's not a typical mash-up where they just take 2 songs together and sang one after another. NOPE. They took 3 or 4 songs together and sang them all at once. You may think that might not work, but it does work!!! They did it in a way, where they start singing a song, but another person start singing another song, and another person start singing another song. I remember doing that stuff in high school too, but that stuff wasn't easy to do! No it does take talent and skills to do it right. Otherwise, yes, it would sound bad, and If done right - it sounds AWESOME!!!<br /><br />Yes, the story is just your typical boy meets girl story. We all know and love, but once again, the music is what I loved the most and that's going to make this a five star movie.<br /><br />I will recommend this movie to all my friends and all of you too!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Really liked this book, kept you wondering until the bitter end.  Awesome ending.  Definitely a good read.  Would highly recommend.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting book in light of teaching in organized religion.  Books like this are dispelling the fear surrounding humanity of death and the crossing over experience which we will all one day face.
B0071T4BVC|5.0|I loved it when I heard all those old favorites. My only problem is that I haven't been able to download my purchase yet.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i like playing it and trying to bet my own score it keeps me going and going so whats not to like
B007SXB498|5.0|It was hard to read because of the many family relatoins, multiple names and the old English style but it held my interest.  I usually do not like love stories but this book had an interesting twist.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i have always liked the movie but the game is just so kool keep the good games coming and i will keep playing
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A real eye opener i plan on buying the childrens one next.  It really made me think about all my relationships
B0086700CM|5.0|this one is just so kool i keep playing it over and over i just love this game i could plat this one in my sleep if i could
B0094OLFUW|5.0|I chose this product because I am a fan. I gave their first album +5 stars. This one has more vocals. Like this one but the first one was the best.
B007HACDLK|5.0|When is the movie coming out? I guess you'd have to get a lily livered lib to produce it. Never mind.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Waiting to watch this as a marathon.  Rainy day, Snowed in, Whatever works !  I buy the seasons on pre-order every year for my son,,,,,now I'm hooked ! This is for me !!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love having this website on the go and when I like to relax it it easy to have my kindle in my hand to view the pages and they are still easy to see like being on my laptop.
1401324649|4.0|This is a crazy, zanny story with lots of chuckles and a few laugh out loud moments.  After listening to me laugh while reading the book, my husband has decided he wants to read it too.  I will say there were moments it felt tedious for the sameness of tone, but overall it's an unusual and light read.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Another delightful story from  Brandon Sanderson.  It is exceptional, with brilliant characters and plotting and the world is just delightful.
B000V8A95C|5.0|Used this as a pre show.  Saw the show in New York and this helped introduce the show to us.  Great sound tract!
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Tom Cruise fun to see, rest pretty pathetic. Would not spend money on, save for a flight :-) hope that helps
B000NGTJTY|1.0|The movie was great, but we lost your signal and could not see the last quarter of the movie. one
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Best Batman series I have seen. This last one was slow at times but the story line is great.  Is it really over???
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Can not wait for the next book, loved this book and have been telling everyone I know to read it...zip could not put this down left me wanting more.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Even though this is probably a pre teen movie, I love it. I haven't read the books yet, and movies are almost never like the books (except for a few occasions). I think the special effects are great and I love the feel of the movie. Definitely worth the buy.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am a cancer survior of 8 years and due to the type of cancer I had I received radiation therapy in 28 sites which effected my intestines, stomach and caused consistent heartburn.  It was virtually impossible to eat vegetables and the only things that made my tomach feel good were carbohydrates but then I was miserable and tired and depressed and looked pregnant most all the time.  I did not go cold turkey but have elimnated breads and wheat products and most sugars from my diet and find that I have lost weight (necessary) of approximately 12 pounds in 3 weeks, I can tolerate vegetables much better and am enjoying salads again and a variety of meats and cheese as well.  I am not constantly hungry nor am I having the intestinal pain that I had suffered for years, nor do I find myself running (literally) to the restroom constantly.  Unfortunately the GERD is due to scarring of the esophogus and I will probably never fully get over it but ...<br /><br />This book has made a profound difference in my life.  The fact that I could feel a difference in a mere matter of days vs. months is making it very easy to make the conversion.  I will probably never be a &#34;purist&#34; but what I have learned has made me feel better about myself and is allowing me to lead a more normal life.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Loved this book. Great action packed book. Jack Reacher is a great character! If you like action movies and enjoy reading you'll love this.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|it's soft porn,with a dumb story line.waste of money really,only bought it because of the hipe.goes to show that someone else's pick a good  books isn't someone elses
0547884591|4.0|Very informative, Tim Ferris's writing does not fail to impress. Great recipes for those struggling to cook for a low-carb lifestyle.
B007SY3CEW|2.0|Its fun but has no option to free play.  To play you have to chose a song to play along with. Can only play single key chords.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great sci-if. Loved the movie and series so fun to watch them again. Would recommend to anyone who is a fan
B0015DYIH2|3.0|Book seemed to drag in places..Ending was not great,,,If you have read the other 3 books might as well read this...
B005QI4TP8|5.0|There is a bit too much of a 'water' theme, but aside from that the music is excellent. I wonder who 'the machine' is?
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Okay, so my boss is a musician. He absolutely loved this gift! he imeediately went home and got out the vinyl. has a great knowledge of music history and informed me there were many things contained in this set that would not have been released in others..
B000QRIGLC|3.0|Not quite what I had expected.  Lots of &#34;lead in&#34; material.  Interesting but doesn't put you on the edge of your seat.  About half way through the book, the actual raid starts to take place so be patient.  I was left with the feeling that Seal Team 6 members take GREAT pride in their anonymity.  This was not only invaded in this story but in the recent recue of the doctor and death of one of the Team's members where the members name was revealed.  I think the pride and honor of being a member of such a heroic and elite team should be resepcted.  I honor all of the members both living and deceased.  Thank you for your service and dedication in keeping America free.
B005UA0FLE|4.0|This is one awesome record but I will never again buy an Mp3 from Amazon.com.  I now have 2 different amazon apps on my iphone and still no music.  My computer downloaded it and put it in my itunes just fine but the fickle iphone is being stubborn and it's just not worth the headache.  I should have had it shipped to me or paid the extra $2 and gotten it in the itunes store.  now I have to make a cd on my computer and delete it from itunes and add it back again. :P  That means I have to buy cd's... which isn't going to happen until after Christmas :(
B0091REZMW|1.0|might be fun if it actually would work.  I can tap and tap but notking happens. no room will open
B000T433CO|5.0|a great romantic holiday movie to snuggle up close with your special date/spouse!<br />great for anytime of the year too!
B009VLXMJA|5.0|A ton of great songs on this album.  I'm a Taylor Swift fan and this is album is definitely a keeper.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Ted has Peter Griffens voice!!!  WTH?  How can Seth use his most recognizable characters voice as Ted and then use all the actors from Family Guy in the same movie and think it's creative?  Very disappointed.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|This movie is not as good as the other movies in the bourne series but decent.  I wish I would have just rented it rather than purchasing it though.
B008476HBM|5.0|It's a beautiful story and a great title: the first part, our hero, Elizabeth, fights with what she thinks is the pride of Mr. Darcy. Then, when she discovers he's a gentleman with a very strong personality, she has to turn al her prejudices against him on his favor. It's a beautiful story.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Action packed and full of comedy. I love all the actors in this one. Worth buying if you haven't already.
B004UIXZV4|5.0|Don't be afraid of the supposed difficulty of Proust: just allow yourself to flow with the beauty and simplicity of words and you'll become a different reader after meeting Proust.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Nothing great; just good mindless entertainment.  Probably more gatuitous violence than was necessary, but typical of these types of movies.  Funny tongue-in-cheek humor.  And fun to see all of the &#34;old-timers&#34; reliving their glory days (mine too!).  As long as you don't expect much in the way of a story line or quality acting, you'll enjoy this movie.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|I think this will eventually meet my needs but, as an older person, I get very frustrated by not having clear instructions on how to use the features,  Have already spent several hours trying hit and miss to figure out. When I finally figure out how to access, use , and then move one from one feature or another it works fine.  I would upgrade to 4 or 5 if I had easily accessable help--or even be willing to pay a dollar or so for such.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|what a mind twister its fun and as you go up the levels it gets harder and imean you can be on one puzzle for about 5 min. trying to figure out how to connect the lines
B008I43DYU|4.0|Figuring out percentages is one of the things I do most ofen. Why not a key? Am I just missing the way to do it easily? Otherwise, fine.
B009HNDCC4|4.0|I love this show. It has it all, its funny, the show have the ups and downs some of us have in the family. Everyone in the cast is great..., well Phil needs to grow a pair I do agree with Jay LOL
B0058UXHHK|4.0|When I started Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes, the first in the Rose Gardner Mystery series, I had doubts whether I'd like it. Some of the reviews I'd seen criticized the main character, Rose, for being simple minded and that the story was too unbelievable.  For me, it was more the simple mindedness that had me worried. Unbelievable? It's about a girl who has visions and is filed under the \\"Fiction\\" label. I think that allows for a little farfetchedness.<br /><br />The first few pages didn't do much to dispel my fears. Rose is the definition of meek. She's nice, polite, and her most offensive expletive is \\"crappy doodles.\\" She's 24 years old and, when she's not working at her mindless job at the DMV, she's at the beck and call of her religious mother (who is downright abusive and tells Rose she's possessed by the devil because she gets \\"visions\\"). While Rose doesn't like her situation, she seemed apathetic to changing it.<br /><br />If the story continued that way for too long, I wouldn't be saying this: I really liked Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes. Despite the uncertainty in the first few pages, Grover Swank didn't waste any time allowing Rose to bloom (pun fun).<br /><br />While at work, Rose gets a vision of herself lying dead on her sofa and faints. Faced with (potentially) her death, she realizes she's never really lived. She stands up to her demanding mother and storms out of the house to cool off. Before she returns, she takes out a Wal*Mart receipt and begins to make a list of things she wants to do before she dies. Commit all the deadly sins in one week, fly in a plane, dance in the rain, visit Italy, drink a beer (is it shocking that the item that made me wince was that she'd never drank a beer?).<br /><br />When she returns home, she realizes she'll have more time than she thought to check off items on the list. Her vision sort ofcame true, except instead of Rose being on the couch it was her mother.<br /><br />Unfortunately, gossip spreads fast and the fact that Rose had fought with her mother right before her mother was murdered hasn't gone unnoticed - especially not by the old busybody across the street and the small-town police officers. Not only is Rose a suspect, but it becomes clear the murderer is still after her.<br /><br />Rose must do her best to keep out of jail and stay alive. After all, she has a list to finish.<br /><br />Obviously, there's the standard \\"Woman gets accused of murder. Real killer pursues woman. Police are corrupt/unmotivated. Woman must solve crime to save her life\\" crime element that is present in so many novels in this genre, but in this circumstance it seemed to serve mostly as a vehicle for Rose's development.  And that was a good thing, because Rose really grew on me (I swear that pun was accidental).<br /><br />Her home life may have kept her naïve and down trodden, but Rose wasn't stupid. Socially awkward? Yes. But that just made her more endearing. It made you want to cheer for Rose - not just to solve the mystery but to experience life. When she got a makeover and purchased some new clothes, I was excited for her. Rose felt like a truly good person and she deserved to feel good about herself!<br /><br />So much of my enjoyment of this book came from Rose checking things off her list. For example, her sitting on the porch with Joe and discovering beer for the first time (and, the next morning, discovering that beer wasn't her new best friend). Oh, and buying the scandalous nighty at Wal*Mart (which didn't sound all that scandalous)...too funny.<br /><br />Of course, you can't review one of these books without mentioning the \\"love interest.\\" Even though I've been loving the hell out of these books (they're a fun way to wrap up my \\"100 books a year\\" reading challenge), I'm not a big romance person. I know, I'm probably the only one who reads these kinds of books and feels that way, but I can usually tolerate it as long as it doesn't take over the plot.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that, in this book, the romance was actually pretty tolerable. Probably because there wasn't a ton of it and, you know, with Rose so innocent and inexperienced, it wasn't going to go all 50 Shades of Grey. Joe was plenty mysterious, but, for the most part, I couldn't help feeling like he was a good guy. It was clear he wanted to keep Rose from getting hurt, but he never tried to make her decisions for her. In fact, he may have been one of the few people in her life that wasn't.<br /><br />The ending itself wasn't all that shocking, but I barely noticed because of how it ended. Just when I thought Rose and her antics couldn't get any better, they did. I was laughing at one sentence and cheering at the next.<br /><br />This maybe one of the best (if not top) feel good books I've read.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham holds your attention throughout this book.  What you think it is about is not what it truly turns out to be.  Loved this book
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I came away feeling \\"entertained\\" but not \\"fulfilled\\" by Lawless... it was \\"Good Enough\\" for an action movie, but seemed to try too hard to fill in the gaps by fluffing the characters in the hope of gaining empathy for them. I don't feel it succeeded in that effort...<br /><br />I did watch this via Amazon Streaming and it looked and worked great!
B004EKCNMA|4.0|Such a great remake of a classic. The animation so great. This is a great movie for family night~ My kids loved it.
B00633W614|5.0|This is the 2nd book of the Clifton Chronicles and was just a good if not better than the 1st.  Archer is a great author that holds your attention right to the end.  I can't wait for the 3rd book of the series is out!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A FINE FOLLOW-UP TO BOOK ONE. DIFFERENT CAST OF CHARACTERS, THE 2ND GENERATION FROM THOSE YOU KNEW IN 1ST BOOK. RICH LAYERING OF INDIVIDUAL STORIES AND HISTORY. ENGROSSING PAGE TURNER.<br />CANNOT WAIT FOR THIRD BOOK.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I usually enjoy Mr, Grisham's books, I thought this one was, not very good. I found it rather below par in writing, substance, and in general I would not recommend this one.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|Not sure whether it was Jeremy Renner or the cookie-cutter 'Bourne' story line, but I just haven't been able to get into this movie. It offers a good cast, good acting, good cinematography, and good action sequences. But therein lies the problem: it's just good, not great like the Matt Damon series. At no point in the film did I feel that I really cared what happened to Renner's character. Hey, I'm not a movie aficionado; I'm just a guy who really liked the three previous Bourne films and was disappointed that Damon declined to go on with it. I was curious what the new adaptation would offer, and having now seen it, largely unmoved. Perhaps if the connections go forward with another entry, they'll figure out what this effort lacked and make the necessary adjustments. I hope so, because I don't feel any closure yet to this story.

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Mila Kunis, Mark Wahlberg, and Seth McFarlane team up for one of the funniest mature comedies of the year. Expect immature behavior and adult themes because this comes from the creative mind of Seth McFarlane, creator of Family Guy. It's definitely worth the $3.99 rental fee from Amazon and I would go so far as to buy it on DVD/Blu-ray in a month or so. Mark Wahlberg plays a working-class guy from Boston with commitment issues whose best friend just so happens to be a walking, talking, beer-drinking, womanizing teddy bear that came to life years ago as a result of a late-night wish. The two are inseparable and their BFF relationship causes a riff between John (Wahlberg) and Lori (Kunis), John's girlfriend. Giovanni Ribisi plays an awesome stalker/creepy guy and Joel McHale turns in a great performance as the lecherous boss. Of course, everything works out in the end but only after some poop jokes, partying with Flash Gordon (Sam Jones), and a chase scene through Boston.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  Don't sit down with your young ones to watch this movie because it's not for them!

B009DQQF7Y|5.0|The storm is coming. It's Monday, October 29th, and hurricane Sandy is scheduled to land on the shores of New York City in just a couple of hours. The governor has declared a state of emergency. The stock market has shut down. Even the presidential election has been put on hold. There's something inevitable about Sandy's approach. There's nowhere to run. There's not much to do. We just have to wait it out. It's ten o'clock in the morning, but the sky is dark as night. I shut off the lights and roll up the window blinds. I open the windows, and let the wind do its dance through my home. I can smell the electricity in every tiny particle that enters my room. And all I need now is some music.<br /><br />There's nothing more apocalyptic than the sound of Godspeed. The Montreal based band has been credited with influencing the so-called post-rock music genre since their debut, titled F♯ A♯ ∞ (1997). Named after a documentary on Japanese biker gang, The Black Emperors (1976), Godspeed You! Black Emperor (which is commonly abbreviated as GY!BE) has put out numerous records on the Canadian Constellation imprint, home to many shoegaze, instrumental rock, and post-rock bands such as Esmerine, Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra, Lullabye Arkestra and Do Make Say Think. The albums have also been reprinted by the Chicago based Kranky label, which exposed the band to a larger audience and gained them somewhat of a cult following among the experimental, ambient, and indie scenes.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the sound of Godspeed. Like an unstoppable moving storm, ready to consume and destroy everything in its path, the music of Godspeed is all about the dynamics. These build ups, inevitable from the very first note, first lurk behind the curtains and then explode onto the stage. This final appearance is raw, heavy, and mighty. The cinematic progression behind each track can take up to twenty minutes to unfold. And in those twenty minutes your mind may wonder and drift with the wailing melody until its jarred back into the presence with a volatile and unstable weather. No need to turn up the volume - the crescendos will come. No need to board up your windows - the glass still will shatter. But with destruction comes hope, credence and peace. No wonder the album is titled, `Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!<br /><br />our cities' grace and pain<br />a stinkin' wind - a plague of policemen<br />and our dreams, alit, sinking in the harbour<br />thee onlookers stare.<br />`allelujah! don't bend! ascend!<br /><br />After a ten year hiatus, it's great to see Godspeed return. The band still maintains its dark humor (the spine of the record is credited to \\"God's Pee\\") and political message (the focus is now war criminals and Quebec student protests). This long awaited comeback may signify a point of reflection on the evolution of social landscape and independent music culture. \\"Godspeed's music will do that to you. It is music that bears witness to, channels and transforms this predominantly terrible, infuriating, venal and nihilistically sad story we're all living, sharing, resisting, protesting, deconstructing and trying to change for the better.\\" And since it's really hard to describe the sound of Godspeed, I only wish to share one final phrase: Godspeed's music makes you feel! And that's a transmission of message through sound.ith the wailing melody until its jarred back into the presence with a volatile and unstable weather.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a wonderful book!  The way Ms. Morgenstern writes is truly a gift.  Her descriptive narrative really brings you into the story. I could picture everything so vividly.  I could hardly put this book down.  Her ability to weave such a wonderful tale, and create such interesting characters is amazing.  I almost wish I can find that clock from the circus!  It would make a beautiful movie, providing the right director stays true to her story.  You should definitely have this on your list of books to read.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|This book was right up my alley.  Lots of experiments, data, and suggestions of things that worked for him, under (semi-) controlled conditions.<br />I am trying out suggestions for supplements and exercise, and still have many others to try in the future.<br />The topics he writes about are typically of interest to most of us, so I didn't find any real throwaway sections of the book.<br />Well worth the price.
B008KW43TE|5.0|What an amazing album.  Every song deliveries.  From start to finish, I am captivated by the lyrics, the melodies and the arrangements.  Channel Orange infuses together funk, R&B, electronica, and pop to bring a buzzworthy album for listeners to experience.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies and I was so happy to be able to find it on Amazon!
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Nothing about this movie is redeeming, and normally just being pretty would cut it. By the end I felt like I was being tortured to watch the rest of this movie. Horrible character development, incoherent and abstract plot with absurd sense of time. Horrible attempts at misguided political sentiment. Just wow you followed up on the Batman series with this. Every decision maker on this movie should be exiled for pandering, and failure to adhere to movie fundamentals.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Recieved six days after ordering,my daughter wanted this movie for christmas, so now she will have it,I couldn't find it in stores.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this book better than Book One.  Maybe because I grew up during this period of time.  Love Follett's work and have read all of his books.  Never disappointed.
B0011Z76RS|5.0|I love this album. I've been waiting for the price to come down forever and finally went for it. Can't wait for their other stuff to drop in price.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Very entertaining but also a great message about giving your life to things that matter.  I was surprised to see that much depth in a Pixar movie - but it wasn't &#34;heavy&#34; at all.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|Storyline was too hard to follow. Maybe after watching it a couple more times, it will all make sense. They should have opted for different screen writers to give us a story with substance. The action scenes were good. I liked the animated movie Rango plot (which was very similar) better!
B009IJJ712|5.0|There is no such thing as too much Sherlock.  This is a fun version, different than the new modern day BBC version, but in a way more watchable and easier to believe.  This Holmes is a little vulnerable at times, and (Dr.) Watson is superb.  Entertaining and easy to watch.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I found Dr. Alexander to be a well educated, intelligent man but his journey was not what I expected. Seemed to be more about his life and his illness.  I did not find Proof of Heaven in this book.

0529005298|5.0|I was given this edition of \\"Little Women\\" when I was in third grade and I loved it! I still do... It took me three months to read the first time, and at the time was the longest book I had ever read. I was very proud of myself. I still have my old copy, but it's pretty battered and I was hoping to find a new copy for my daughter.  It is disappointing that this version, with beautiful illustrations by Tasha Tudor, is not currently in print. A trade-size paperback would be fine, as long as it had the TT illustrations!  I would pay more to buy it in hardcover. I would think that with so many people buying cheaper e-books that a beautiful edition of a classic like this would be good for the print book industry. I think that the illustrations not only make the book more beautiful, but also more accessible to younger readers. (Also, no one will get confused, as Joey on the tv show \\"Friends\\" did, about the fact that Jo is a girl and Laurie is a boy!). Seriously, I treasured this book as a child and I was always grateful to the family friend who inscribed it to me, with the date, when she gave it to me as a gift.  This is a wonderful book to give as a gift!

B0063GORYU|3.0|Fun to play when you can not get WIFI . It is not very challenging but gives you something to do in a car or doctor,s office.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Expectations were high for me due to the initial movies with Matt Damon. This film needed to at least match the others in intensity and action. Jeremy Renner did a good job and was believable but was saddled with a week story line that made him dependent on substances. Furthermore, the film ended without closure for me. I would like to have seen the bad guys get there due in the end.<br />Good overall, but disappointing.

B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This is a great story. It portrays the time (prohibition) very well. However, it is an extremely violent movie. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.

B003WUYP56|5.0|I have a life long fascination with all aspects of Science.  Although I am not a professional physicist, I have read many books on relativity, quantum mechanics, string theory, and related topics.  Smolin's book has emerged as my single favorite for one very simple reason: the realism and balanced view he brings to the subject.  I agree with him completely on his analysis of the limits of current M-theory articulations and welcome his reassertion of the scientific method into the debate.  If it isn't  falsifiable it just is not science in my opinion.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been overwhelmed by all the apparent complexities of string theory.

The reader is able to follow the events leading up to the war, the progression of the war & how the politics played out among the involved counties, whilst being enthralled with the personal stories of many characters.<br />It's a big book but don't let that daunt the reader.It's hard to put down!<br />A must for those who love a dose of history & a good story.
B0019IB0II|5.0|What an amazing journey, and how amazing the spiritual side of  the brain is. Book was fascinating and hard to put down.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|it was nice to see a movie where someone really cared and it was very funny. Arthur Christmas should be watched by everyone.
B00A0R0CG0|2.0|Pro:  Not a complete waste of money since we did watch the entire thing.<br />Con: Eminently forgettable and will probably never watch again.  As such I wish I had just rented it.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Pretty good, but does not live up to the hype.  More flash and fluff than anything else. It let me kill two hours.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I first bought this game on the iPod and enjoyed it but I just bought the kindle fire HD and was so happy when I saw this in the market and this game is fun for everyone I recommend it to everyone
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I really like this game. Lots of fun, hope they come out with more. I have them all and look forward to more!
B005544TRQ|4.0|This show is so much fun. Just watching the antics of this legal crew is a laugh a minute with a little seriousness thrown in now and then just to keep us grounded. Wouldn't miss it for anything,
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I really enjoyed the Nikki Heat series.  Looking forward to more from Richard Castle.  .Ordered one right after the other.
B0091MW4QG|3.0|Not quite what I thought it was. Instead, a sample from each of Verdi's operas by the Parma company. Performance is OK. HP
B000W93CHC|5.0|I miss the book, now that I am done. It is a cool down after Pillars of the Earth.<br />I really didn't want that world to end! Ken Follett is my new favorite author. His<br />characters live vividly in your mind and the constant conflict, twists and turns<br />in his stories keep you mesmerized.<br /><br />J Allison Marlowe
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My number of prize is already 7 digits and it is overlaped with game number, not enought space to separate this two set numbers.
0142429104|4.0|\\"My pappy taught me to work hard, but he never taught me to like it.\\" Abraham Lincoln<br /><br />Books on tape (or CD) are my favorite technological invention. I listened to Amy Chua's bestseller, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, on my commute.<br /><br />What is the essence of the book? Children don't want to work hard if left to their own devices. Parents and teachers must give children a stomach for hard work and assist them in developing persistence and an ability to weather setbacks. Only then can success and enjoyment begin.<br /><br />Teaching differs little from parenting. Outside of AP classes, not many high school sophomores want to work hard. Even fewer want to work hard reading history. Fewer still want to study the World History standards mandated by California professors. These standards include Plato and Aristotle, the English Bill of Rights, the French Revolution, and British Industrialization. That's only part of the curriculum for the first semester.<br /><br />Good innovative high school history teachers employ partnering, group activities, simulations, debates, and technology. We work hard to keep students engaged in material that isn't engaging on its own. We'll do whatever it takes. If they don't do the work offending students are punished with lectures about what it takes to succeed, remediation sessions, and, of course, poor grades. We will train you to work hard. Like Abe Lincoln's pappy, we don't care if you like it or not.<br /><br />When these kids have matriculated they have a sharper focus on what they want to pursue in life, and some decide to get a college degree. The first two years as an undergraduate are, again, filled with university and major requirements, many not to the student's liking. The minority that get through those first two years and attempt upper division college work finally explore courses of interest. That's a lot of years in school satisfying others' requirements, about 15 years, before a student gets to follow his or her bliss. Let's hope that someone has taught these kids the art of persistence somewhere along the way.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Too many vampires in recent literature.  They have nothing to do with witches.  This book does not honor the people who died in Salem.
B000V63BN6|5.0|A great collection to add to your music repertoire. I love Stevie Wonder he is a musical genius by far.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Not well researched.  Lot of the plot was farfetched. It certainly isn't like our justice system works.  I di not recommend this book at all.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Almost unwatchable. Only reason I sat through to the end was that I paid four bucks. Would have possibly been okay had I had some of that mind rape.
B007C3TVNA|5.0|This movie will totally get in your head. It's not what you see, it's what you don't. I'm extra glad I never had kids after seeing this movie. This is movie is a must have.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Good family movie wife wanted to see it she teaches kids so she kind of watches these type movies. It was enjoyable to watch.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to use and if you have to wake up this is a good way to do it. Love the declining snooze and small dismiss button.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing .  My favorite TV show and great adaptation of a brilliant comic book series.  I can only hope it will last as long as the books.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Slow start... but it eventually grabs you and you can't let go. Had a hard time putting it down at night.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was an amazing book which keeps you guessing what is going on. I was able to figure out the ending but not until last 3 chapters! It is amazing book which keeps you hooked until the end. It has love, drama, horror, anger, tears... the works! One the better books I have read in an while!
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.... I always seem to miss it when it comes on tv so now I have it on my Fire to watch whenever I want to..
B000025Y9I|4.0|This album was much better than I expected. i was pleased with the collection of songs and his unique voice.
B007704HO6|3.0|This is not a literary masterpiece but the writer deserves huge credit for his perseverance .. it certainly gives an insight in the very structured way that the Big Issue magazine is marketed
B00AAAKH80|5.0|New age country, love all of the rock and even a little rap-ish influences in it. Still country though! Fun album and one of my favorites right now!
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|This book was highly recommended in the Guardian list of 2012 books. The story line is quite good but I feel that is was written to be made into a movie. What could have been written in 2 pages took 10 to 12 pages .. rambling on and on .. I was disappointed
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Grandkids  friend then  Desjardins. Is disband  find six. Cm  when cm  end endings hand mensch Jensen msec find. If so. Did. Eh. End. Dobbs  sjB e s t  f r e e
B003B02PFO|4.0|A must read for the season. I laughed all most all the way through and pictured my husband and I going through the insanity!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not the type of person who reads romance novels. However, when my sisters and mom wouldn't stop going on and on about this book I finally gave in. I was hooked by the second chapter. There are many points in this book that made me blush. I just couldn't put it down. I would recommend it to any woman!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Familar with the issues, especially the hacking.  Well done but the use of concerted military pressure is not really likely.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|The humor is on Par with say Family Guy.  Not something to watch in front of the kids though, you'll be able to tell in like this first 5 minutes to kick the kids out of the room, but it's funny.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|My daughter likes Littlest Pet Shop, so I thought she might enjoy this game.  We went to buy a home for her 1st pet, one home was free, and the other homes had purchase prices up to $99.99.  REALLY?  This game is awful.  I feel as though Gameloft is hoping some child is left alone with the game and can purchase multiple homes and animals for hundreds of dollars.  This game should be banned!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Not only entertaining but also educational. I show this during activity periods at my school. I get to use it to discuss environmental and social issues future generations will face.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|We all love Angry Birds, so we bought the Star Wars Premium version.  The problem is the game is not complete.  Levels are still being worked on. On some planets you have to buy additional levels.  I feel like Rovio is starting to scramble for money and that is upsetting.  Once I buy  game I don't want to have to keep purchasing more and more.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My daughter likes My Little Pony, so I thought she might enjoy this game.  We went to the store and the purchase prices went up to $99.99.  REALLY?  This game is awful.  I feel as though the Gameloft is hoping some child is left alone with the game and can purchase multiple homes and animals for hundreds of dollars.  This game should be banned!
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|very entertaining, all the 80's action stars in one movie, lots of action and very funny with lots of blood and guts
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game was recommended by a friend. It is lots of fun. The only down side is it's highly addictive.
B009KHCRVO|1.0|dumbest movie ever, i should have been shot for setting through the whole thing, i have to add six more words to post this stupid crap
B0063IH60K|5.0|what I do when I am board with what is happening at that time of day ! only Game I play on the computer or my Kindle Fire
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This is fun film to watch,  Robert Downey Jr. is outstanding as usual. The special effects, especially Robert's &#34;costume&#34; is spectacular. An very enjoyable movie.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|If you an child of the 80's.... then you've seen The Breakfast Club.  Great comedy with a &#34;lesson&#34; learned in the process.  If you haven't seen it..... or it's been a while.... you need to watch it.
B009AJDDQU|3.0|You have to be ready for this one which has become a cult classic.  Sit back, enjoy the comments of others and enjoy the strangeness.  Some great spoofs available.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I read the graphic novels and enjoy them very much.  The show is also very entertaining.  However, due to its departure from main elements from the written Walking Dead series, I find myself getting frustrated by this show.  For those who have also read the novels, I advise you to look at this a separate and distinct. Otherwise, I would tell you to sit back and enjoy the show.
B007L5KT76|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. makes a great Holmes and brings his unique talent to this classic tale. You will want to see more of this Sherlock.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|This was about what I expected.  A typical comic book turned movie and its accompanying corny dialogue and mediocre CGA.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|As a former expat, I easily recognized the true to life characterization of life in the international expat community abroad. Gripping suspense, a surprise at every turn.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|All in all, I enjoyed this movie. However, there were times that I was overwhelmed with the number of new characters, subplots, and twists. I think it could have been a little more straight forward.
1878424114|5.0|THE BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD, IT REALLY HAS PUT MY LIFE IN ORDER I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF THINGS THAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN MY LIFE THAT I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. I HAVE BEEN PRACTICING THE LAWS AND IT'S BEEN HELPING ME ALOT.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|As always Follett wove some historical facts and places with the fictional characters in the story.  Although the ending was weak in my view the book is an entertaining read.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Dickens is an incredible author with an amazing heart. This story is fantastic for all ages all year round but especially a wonderful Christmas tale.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Loved this movie. A perfect ending to the trilogy! I doubt there will be another movie in the series and it does leave some questions open but isn't that one of the factors of a good movie? It leaves you wondering.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I re-read L.M. Alcott's Little Woman as our book club's (On the Same Page Book Club) December/Christmas pick-of-the-month (we decided to choose a light, beloved book from our childhood). I first read this book when I was 8 years old (I'm now 68) and I fell in love with all the characters. I've seen all the movie adaptations and also loved them (especially the Susan Sarandon, Winona Rider version, although K. Hepburn was a \\"capital\\" Jo!) I occasionally had a bit of a giggle about some of the sentimentality, the over-the-top language, (especially Amy's) and the dated mannerisms (so glad I didn't live back then ~ I'd be a social outcast!) On the other hand, the story is so heart-warming and charming, I soon was able to overlook the fact it was written more than 150 years ago. It is surely a CLASSIC and will remain so for generations to come!
B004GYY714|3.0|This app works effectively on my Kindle Fire, but so do others. It is free, so it wins points for that.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|This was a birthday present and it was exactly what I had in mind. I would highly recommend this product.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|This app was difficult to navigate and came with no instructions. Once I figures it out, it was enjoyable to use, though you need to be specific about the sounds you choose as it is possible to have them all on at once, which would not be very relaxing.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The history most of people know already, but the books and this kindle version make this bundle a really great one for anyone interested! Extremely highly recommended.<br /><br />The history shows us a different way to construct the caracters. You don't have that good and that bad guy, both of them can play both roles on different parts of the history. That's simply amazing!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I can't get into the Angry Bird craze, but my 4-year-old twins love it. They like the original version better, but this one offers a variety and new challenges for them.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book should interest everyone and help those who fear death.  I have found that the American culture has a problem with death, using terms like he passed away, etc.  Reading this book should help those who fear dying.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Real simple, if you have to ask, you probably just don't get it.<br />If you like drama set in a post-apocalyptic zombie world, this is pretty much all you got, and it's pretty good, so 5 starts it is.
B006QPX6IG|5.0|If I could give this movie more then 5 stars I would, it's that good.  Nothing more to be said just watch it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I thought the story line was very bizarre. The book was recommended to me, but I wouldn't recommend it myself.
