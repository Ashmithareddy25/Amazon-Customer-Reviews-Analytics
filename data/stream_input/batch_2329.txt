B0060AY6FO|2.0|Trite, boring, predictable and contrived. Not worth the money and a poor choice for our book club. The person who chose this book will do no more choosing!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|And thats saying a lot because i absolutely loved the first one. It is intriguing the way that they used actors from season one in season two as completely different characters in a completely different era and place. Could it be that they are all being punished in reincarnation? I don't get it. I'm confused and i love it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|BEST BOOK BY SPARKS BY FAR<br />I couldn't stop reading it, it was just incredible. Huge plot twist, couldn't even fathom the ending!
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|Mama is a beautiful monster! Very entertaining film with a great ending. Jessica Chastain was fantastic! Must see for horror fans. Highly recommended...⭐⭐⭐⭐
B000SEGUDE|5.0|It has been years since I've enjoyed a book as much as this one.  Cloud Atlas is a rich, thought-provoking epic of a novel.Mitchell's command of style and voice and philosophy is stunning.  I never read a book twice, but I am compelled to return to the world of Cloud Atlas immediately.
1936850028|5.0|This was a fun book that adequately describes not only the Birkie, but Grandma's Marathon in Duluth, skiing abroad, and all that is involved with the world of endurance races.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The 'Catcher In The Rye' of science fiction. Truly a pleasure to read, or re-read as I have for this review' , and for anyone looking for a genre defining work that is both a coming of age story and a suspense filled thrill ride. I can't say more than the thousand other reviews except:  read this book. It is well worth your time.
0062082353|5.0|great price every time im looking for a book i will look here first.since my friends found i have it they wont one for them
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this movie, but once I watched it I realized they tried to keep within the realism of the period. The acting is very good. Excellent movie.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Have tried to use this with a multtab excel calendar. No matter what format I save it in. xls sor xlsx. The app will not move between tabs.  It is alway stuck on January, not matter what I do, I cannot get to the next month.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|I bought this classic movie for my daughter. She loves this movie and watches it constantly. It will never grow old. Great movie and great actors and singers.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very easy to see graphics.  Clear and sharp.  Looking forward to a sequel and more games of similar quality.  Also a good story line.
B0063IH60K|4.0|love it, yes I would recomend this game to everyone of any age, a great time filler for any part of the day
B002AKPECW|4.0|There is nothing too large or too complex for this book, deep time, unimaginable distances, multiple civilizations.  Nothing has been allowed to get in the way of the story.  Yet at the same time the article has never been out of control.  A great read.  There are some formatting issues with the Kindle version which bugged me a bit but not enough to really worry about.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This is the strongest survival knife you can buy,and at a great price! Made of 1095 steel. Its 1/4 inch thick,full tang. This knife is THE workhouse of all knifes! It will still be around when the others are wore out and broke.Comes with a good nilon carry with a nice pocket you can carry alot in.Holds a edge good,chops good . I have used this knife alot and nothing can hold up to it.
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|I think this is a great movie! I love the time era, set back during the civil war it has a love story with a little drama, Classic movie, glad I own it.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|My Opion I that thers no point in getting this app its notlike the original.But oly if we could try a smaple of the games then u would under stand. But that's my oponinwhats yours?
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A great book. Far better than most movie remakes and different still than the classic old Treasure Island movie which comes closest to capturing the book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Without making a fuss about it, Chris Kyle gives us an inside look at a true American warrior. Neither glorified or vilified, this is how it was for him, his team, his friends, his family and his story.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite buys for my Kindle.  I have all three books in one!<br /><br />Collins is quite talented and the storytelling kept me interested for each of the three books.  Here's a short breakdown:<br /><br />The Hunger Games: This book had me from chapter one.  I couldn't put it down and read the entire book in just a few hours.  At the end, I was hooked and had to immediately go and buy the second one.  I loved Katniss and her fierce devotion to her family.  Collins provides us with a wonderful dystopia to explore in which we cannot help but wonder how people could let this horror happen.<br /><br />Catching Fire: This book is probably my favorite of the three.  Collins gave us a nice blend of familiar and new characters.  The political aspect was intriguing.  For those that haven't read, be ready for some situational irony that will leave you breathless by the end of the book.<br /><br />Mockingjay: A lot of people had issues with this book, but I found it enjoyable.  Collins lets us see the consequences of The Hunger Games while exploiting the true horrors of a corrupt government, giving some insight into those with mental instability, and showing how a people can rise.  It is probably my least favorite of the trilogy, but it is still worth reading.  It will tug at your heartstrings and that's part of what makes it a good read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers I downloaded the update at 12:00 am last night. I have all of the characters except Prince k I have 956785 coins
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this novel.  I found myself surprised the entire time because I grew up with the movie, rather than the actual novel.  When I finally got around to reading this, it was very different from the movie version.<br /><br />A few changes are:<br />The Wicked Witch of the West is not green, not young, and not beautiful.<br />The witch has command of other animals than just the flying monkeys.<br />Dorothy's shoes are not ruby red, but silver.<br />Glenda is not the Witch of the North, but of the South.<br /><br />There are a few other plot points, but for the most part, it was the familiar tale I grew up loving.  If you are an Oz fan, be sure to read the original novel.  You'll appreciate all the other interpretations even more.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well my only concern is that I can't get the update when I want it when I try to get it &#34;instantly&#34; it takes me to Amazon and its really annoying!!! Other than that it's a great game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is one of the premier shows that is still a well kept secret. I can't believe it took us so long to found out about it.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|It's ok and all but when I want the game to update on my kindle fire. It never does. When it doesn't I usually have to delete my game and download the new version without the stuff I had before. Why?  Thanx for the help
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Great mix of soul, jazz, and hip hop.....amazing covers of Nirvana's smells like teen spirit and Sade's cherish the day. Anyone who enjoys neon soul would not be disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like the game very much it's one of the most funniest game ever I just don't like how u have to get all that money for those people cost
B000W4RFHK|5.0|If your on the fence about buying this book just make the leap of faith and go for it. Great enlightening read
B002PZC8BM|5.0|One of my favorite shows. I just want to keep watching them again and again. They are all my favorite actors so good together. I would recommend this to you.  Very enjoying.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|While visiting parent in New England we got hooked into the story line and desired to see the whole thing.  The DVD purchased allowed us to accomplish this within a short period of time and casued us to order and wait for the 3rd DVD to be released.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have always been hands-on person and a very linear thinker.  This book gave me things to think about that I had never before considered.  Definitely a thought-provoking book.  I actually ordered it by mistake, but I am glad I did.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|A great series--shared with others who have sinced then been watching the re-runs. Every-one has enjoyed watching it and are waiting for new releases.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this in several locations and it never lets me down.<br />It's especially useful when travelling. Five stars aren't. enough.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|THIS IS AN ORIGINAL SERIES WHICH SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY HISTORICALLY ACCURATE. THE CHARACTERS ARE BELIEVABLE, WELL CASTED AND WELL PLAYED. I LOOK FORWARD TO IT EACH WEEK AND RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS
B0093LINVK|5.0|It's small, it's well built, and is tailor made for tradeshows and it even comes with an amazing VESA adapter plate that's actually made of metal. However....I ordered the thunderbolt edition and the dual HDMI came instead....and NO power cord to go from the power brick to the wall....and the box was still shrink wrapped and the cheesy intel sound effect was still playing when I opened the box.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I am not really a die-hard video gamer, so I missed a lot of the video game references, but I was a late teen in the 1980s and loved all of the references to my favorite movies, bands, and other pop culture memories. Aside from that, the story was engaging enough (I think) to appeal to younger teens who have no idea what happened in the 20th century.<br /><br />This book takes place in the future, where conditions have deteriorated to the point that most people prefer to spend most of their time in the virtual reality OASIS. The creator of OASIS uses the occasion of his impending death to initiate a giant treasure hunt, with the grand prize being his entire online empire. Large numbers of \\"gunters\\" immediately start scouring all of Halliday's biography for clues to where the keys and gates are hidden. Because of the value of owning OASIS, they are joined by corporate \\"Sixers\\" who want to take over OASIS and charge money to access it.<br /><br />The main character, Parcival, finds the first key, and then has to race all of the other players to find the treasure. Along the way, his life is threatened by the Sixers, he makes some new friends, and finds what may be his first love.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the descriptions of the possibilities for online expansion -- including the online public schools. The real world is described as well, but only in passing, since most of the action takes place on the various planets of OASIS.  The characters are charming -- especially Parcival and the rest of the High Five, Aesch, Art3mis, Shoto, and Daito. The quests to earn the keys are interesting and challenging, while still being familiar (which helps the reader to feel like s/he could compete as well). It was fun ferreting out the clues along with the players. Although there were details about the OASIS world that you couldn't know, most of the clues were references to pop culture, so it was possible to have an idea what they were. The corporate Sixers were ideal villains,and perfectly embodied the faceless, nameless, corporate culture.<br /><br />I am not sure how this book is marketed, but it would definitely be appropriate for teens. There is no sex, and only video game type violence. They might not get all of the references, but it could definitely lead to a resurgence of 80s movies and video games. This is a great book and I am already looking forward to the next novel by Ernest Cline.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the game is great and I get a kick out if the &quot;card dance&quot; after a successful game. yes. there is an ad at the beginning of each game. hit the skip button or X and play the game.  I haven't had any issues with ads popping up unexpectedly on my kindle fire where I have the game installed.  I love this app!  thanks!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great game to play when your bored or on trips like on an airplane or driving in a car.
B000005H4G|5.0|After tearing through my vinyl LP collection several times, I had to concede that no, I never had purchased this album as much as I love every song on it. So, I now I own it, because truly, no Jazz, no music collection, is complete without it. Simply beautiful to listen to over and over...
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|I just opened an investment account and I had no clue about buying and selling stocks or bonds. This app totally helped me get to know each stock I would be investing in by giving me a detailed but not overwhelming amount of information. This app probably saved me from throwing away a ton of money and it didn't cost me anything.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book was easy to read, easy to understand, with great ideas for handling what life presents to us all.  I leaf through it all the time.  It's great when I'm overwhelmed!
B008M7BQHE|5.0|Still more greatness.  The characters continue to progress and grow.  Relationships change and craziness (believable given the setting) ensues with a fresh new seasonal plot.  We've been devouring these episodes at a phenomenal rate and see no reason to stop.
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|Attempted to use this app to purchase a print at home Amazon gift card and was forced to exit the app and use Android browser.  Why even use the app if I ultimately have to use the browser?  Had to enter login and credit card multiple times and when ultimately given pdf to download and print, was unable to open the pdf without a password that was not provided.  Finally gave up and switched to laptop and was able to print without incident, no password required.
034552554X|4.0|I liked that it was an easy read, and at the same time not a predictable read.  A nice break from more complicated text.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Every other episode in this season is filled with fillers. You might find yourself watching an episode and wondering when something is going to happen only to find that nothing happens.
B00BKS1HIA|5.0|Ann Budd is simply the author of choice for the foundation of sock construction. She explains ever step very clearly, with illustrations. I own both the hard copy and the Kindle version. Though I also own other sock-knitting books, it is this copy that I pick up when I need a refresher.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I THINK THIS APP IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! IT IS SO FUN TO PLAY, ESPECIALLY WITH FRIENDS. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP. I GOT IT FOR A CHEAP PRICE BECAUSE I HAVE AMAZON PRIME  =D
B00AIA89HS|3.0|I don't know wtf all these 5 stars are for here. A bunch of tone deaf fan boys obviously because this album lacks the catchy  pounding riffs and punk influences that have made hatebreeds albums great. Instead all I hear are Jamey's vocals dominating each song and the self empowering lyrics are completely corny by being to literal. They lack the subtlety  of \\"I will be heard, live for this, proven\\" as and example. The instrumentals sound like a shell of Hatebreeds former selves as they lack the intensity of their prior albums. Overall In spite of hatebreeds musical integrity to not change their style in this album, I still felt it was to much Jasta here and not enough Hatebreed which made this release sub par to everything prior ..
0061122416|5.0|This book had been on my \\"To Read\\" list for a long time (like so many others).  I had a hard time putting this one down, as it is so well written -- simple, yet eloquent, with a powerful message, like all of his books.  The story is engaging enough that I think my 10 year old will love it, too, though I know he will have many questions while reading it... which is a good thing.  :)<br /><br />A coming-of-age story of love, magic and wisdom.  I highly recommend this book to all seekers of Cosmic Truth!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best game i have ever played my friends talk a about it a lot. Ps lol
B0064X7FVE|5.0|A very helpful app great for getting the weather.  This should be included with the Kindle when it is purchased.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|it is alreadyin my top three shows that i leave my schedule open for every week wish it was on every night.
0316286850|5.0|You will learn more from this book than any YouTube channel. I still refer to it. Kevyn was a genius.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|This series of Stargate holds your attention from the beginning to the end of each episode. Stargate fans will absolutely love the attention to detail of the series. The characters are lovable and keep you coming back for more action and adventure.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest and seem to be on it more than I should. But using it on my kindle fire is such a pain at times as it freezes up often and I have to leave the app. Sometimes when I come back it is still frozen. I don't have trouble with any my other apps.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the variety this game offers. Keeps me and my family busy on long trips. Long doctors visits and so on. I love the puzzles and choices the games offer.
0439023521|5.0|Sometimes there are books that actually deserve the hype they receive and The Hunger Games is one of them. A terrific and dark tale of survival in an evil authoritarian state. A future classic to be enjoyed for generations. I know Suzanne Collins doesn't need any more praise, but I'm happy to give it anyway.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game so much. I think that gamers that like a challenge would like this game. Also its not just one level or difficulty, there's tons.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love the show! Super funny! Enjoying it whileit lasts! Before they get into telling to deep of stories and it turns into some weird nerdy soap opera......it always happens......
B00BESLHEA|4.0|This one is between a 4 and a 5 for me because the action was fun and yes, it did have a story.  Less violent than kill bill.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Its just depressing........ Its not a witty look into the struggles that come with life........ Its only funny in that the characters are pathetic and off-putting......... The humour seems to want to break through but it just doesnt deliver.......you just end up feeling sorry.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Would definitely recommend to anyone who missed the first season and wants background on some of the current interplay. And no commercials!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie - a bit different for Tommy Lee Jones.  A good weekend distraction type movie on a rainy day.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|I love the design and compactness. Having to recharge it is sort of a pain (battery doesn't last very long). And it's not all that loud. But, the concept is good and it worked okay.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|We took a trip recently and downloaded to the kindle the game Angry Birds.  It kept my husband happy and engaged in something other than telling me how to drive!
B00AVF8USS|5.0|Great visuals, and fantastic imagery. Very nice, original plot, with a great cast. Very nice to see Sigourney Weaver in a movie again
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I don't say it is the best but it was ok I don't think it also was one of my faves. But it will do
B003MAQM6Q|5.0|After it's been out this long, they're really asking me to rate Fight Club, as if someone saw it and DIDN'T dub it as easily in the top 10 list of movies of all time?! Really?! Okay, I'll bite. It's in my top 10, and I've seen THOUSANDS. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are both so brilliant in this, and they both play so brilliantly off each other, that it's all just...brilliant. Chuck Palahniuk (the author of the book that the movie is based on) has such a hauntingly wonderful mind, and combind that with David Fincher (the director who gave us such gems as: Alien 3, SEVEN, Panic Room, and Zodiac, to name a few.), it's just...mind: BLOWN!!! Will leave u with a little golden nugget of a quote: YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL. YOU ARE NOT A BEAUTIFUL AND UNIQUE SNOWFLAKE. YOU ARE THE SAME DECAYING ORGANIC MATTER AS EVERYONE ELSE, AND WE ARE ALL A PART OF THAT COMPOST PILE.
B0041ZQHHA|5.0|I received this for Christmas, and I love love love it.  Not good running music, but I love this album.
B002SWVC64|5.0|Great true story, Julia was great in it! She could really pull off 'Erin'. Just fantastic! The costars rolls, even though they might have been small, were performed by great actors, and really accented the whole movie as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awsome i love i recomend it for every pne even a 80 year olds espeacily the Sydney version just got it
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Tons of action, plenty of great, cheesy one-liners, and enough veteran action stars to make any man cry! Just perfect! Loved the first one, loved this one, and can't wait for the 3rd installment!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I love this series.  The characters are well rounded and real.  Each episode keeps me on the edge of my seat.  I am working on collecting the entire series.
B005O64VH8|4.0|As some others have said, there are definitely times on this CD when I was sure I'd<br />heard a particular tune before. But every time, the track then builds into something quite unique and becomes its own. Case in point is track 1 - starting as a 'typical' Secret Garden simple piano tune which sounds a bit familiar (is it doubling up? I haven't checked) - but then which builds up to a beautiful and satisfying crescendo unlike any other. The first 7 tracks are wonderful - with track 3 with Moya Brennan and Track 5 being (in my opinion) masterpieces. The others are nearly as good, and I love the fact that they include unashamedly heartfelt and insightful Christian lyrics when they want to, as in Track 7. My only complaint is that the CD seems, to me, to lose steam toward the end. (I felt Earthsongs did the same thing - losing oomph about half way through.) I know the last 2 tracks were written for other occasions - and there are moments when I enjoy the Suite (track 11) - but after the first 7 tracks, I find I lose interest in the two slower numbers (tracks 8 and 9), that I dislike the schmalzy 'Powered by Nature', and that the Suite has too many quiet sections that seem to be just biding time and going nowhere.<br />But the first 7 tracks? Wonderful stuff!!! They are so good I give the CD 4 out of 5 stars.<br />A late added note:<br />A few weeks later, I find that Track 9 has really grown on me!! The CD is getting better and better!!!!!
B008M87GJK|4.0|I really enjoy the BBC news. They have been around many, many years, and their news reporting is tops. I would recommend this to everyone. The world's news at your fingertips.
B005FISBTO|3.0|Beware, since the quality of the DVD image is TERRIBLE. At times I thought I was watching a pirate movie, it is so, so bad you can see the pixels in the image. It was very disappointing, since I am a big Dexter fan and was really looking forward to having the sixth season. I don't know how the DVD's were produced, but it was a very poor work, probably a copy from a faulty master.<br />Other than the quality of the DVD, the sixth season is not my favorite, but still has lots of exciting parts.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Engaging Characters, a well structured plot, and really fantastic dialogue and description made this a truly great book. I've loved the entire series, and the stand alone sequels. Joe Abercrombie is an author to watch.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|The best of the author's three novels. Looking forward to her next.  Love gillian flynn's method of detail and character development.
B004GYY714|5.0|I really love this apt. The music is awesome. I really enjoy this when I,m work in. Thank you for providing it.
B00BL5YQKS|4.0|Gritty and suspenseful makes you like the bad guys.  Definitely the show to pioneer the thin line between tv and not for tv
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I loved the lst Season of Fringe.  Lots of excitement & great characters....especially Walter.  I WILL watch the other Seasons!
B00BJS7LHC|3.0|This is nothing great. It doesn't reflect history accurately. But it is entertaining and reminiscent of the days before political correctness dominated everything.  That would be the days of my childhood and before all the electronic games.  Cowboys and Indians. Cops and Robbers.  That kind of stuff.<br /><br />The scenes depicting blood letting were overdone and the human body doesn't hold that many gallons of blood. In fact, I'm not sure Home Depot has that many gallons of red paint.  One of Foxx's quick draws went sideways, but he hit his mark anyway.<br /><br />And for those who like to call white men \\"crackers\\", the origin of that slang is in the movie. It actually stems from the overseer that \\"cracked\\" the whip on the backs of the slaves. Fortunately for most slaves, and contrary to current politically induced misdirection, few if any slaves ever had it quite as bad as what was shown on the silver screen. The (PC \\"N\\") word was way overused, to the point of actually being boring.<br /><br />In my opinion, not worth the price.  Three bucks tops.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Daughter loves this game. Entertains her and has good graphics. We use as incentive for her to get her chores and homework done in a timely manner.
6305128952|4.0|couldnt remember the movie , husband mentioned wanting it so he got it for easter  havnt watched it yet but cant be too bad with robert redford and horses
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Such an interesting mythical setting and great characters. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who likes this kind of mythology.<br />I plan to read the next books.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love the graphics and how it runs smoothly. It is an awesome little time killer for all the Ice Age fans of any age.
B009Z5BPZK|3.0|I had no problem with the product itself. It had the gag reel (my favorite) and the retrospective that was aired before the airing of the final episode.<br /><br />The actual season, being only 10 episodes, was priced as though it was a full season of 22 episodes. It was extremely overpriced. I urge others to wait a year until the price drops. I will bet it goes down to about $8-$10.<br /><br />The actual episodes..........eh. I found myself a bit disappointed with this season, I feel like they could have done so much more. And the last episode, I found so confusing. The whole scene with Dan and Serena are talking, since he didn't actually say that he was Gossip Girl, it made it so confusing. I didn't understand that the writers of the show were actually trying to say that Dan was GG until all of the characters were in the living room. I loved that Blair and Chuck got married and lived happily ever after, but I wish we would have gotten to see more of their happily  ever after. To see Serena and Dan get married.......it just feels fake, I feel like she's gong to be divorced in a few years. I just found myself disappointed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|everyone needs a calculator! this is the perfect calculator app. 5 stars! it has all the regular stuff you would need for a calculator for homework.
B00068TJM6|3.0|For some reason the watch does not look so fantastic I am not sure why could be just the colour .the dial looks good and it is easy to see in subdued light. The usual Seiko time piece technology does not miss a beat.Guess I would have loved tp buy the Breitling air mans watch however I can't afford it right now.
B006M4F67A|4.0|The images in this game are clear and easy to see even without my reading glasses. It's a fast moving game and can be done in 10 -15 min. usually.
B0067EKY9K|4.0|Just a really nice movie with a good story and I loved the scenery. Talking about love I love emily blunt and find her work always convincing. The ending is probably predictable however the story outcome is not . Well worth a look buy this one.<br /> From amazon of course.<br />Geoffrey j hyde
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Ever since I got my tablet, I've been ordering books through Kindle here on Amazon. I love it! So convenient, I get it instantly, and they are usually less expensive than the physical copy of the book. Thank you Amazon!
B00AF6B22E|4.0|I was wondering where this movie was going to go and I felt both sorry for the lead role guy and angry however the ending saved it for me. I need to watch it again to really understand what the story is telling underneath the main plot. The landing scene is brilliant and I don't recommend that the movie be watched before a flight. I may re rate this movie after i see it again.
B009P12OBI|4.0|I came to ELP through the King Crimson album &#34;Hall of the Crimson King&#34; so I wasn't a big fan of keyboard heavy prog.  The writing is good and the keyboard performances are frantic and skilled but I just didn't care for the sonic assault of songs like &#34;Tocatta.&#34;  The music is good, so I can't give it a bad review.  I can only say that this isn't a band I'd pursue.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Stunningly different from any sci-fi novels recently read. An image of life that could frightfully become reality in the not to distant future. I didn't want to stop reading but when I did my imagination still kept me within Mockingjays world. Scary!!
B000VZJUGY|5.0|This is a great 90s album that still holds up.  Sparse soundscapes, angst and anger, it's an album that rewards repeat listening to gather all the instrument sounds and textures.  Highlight of a great career.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book! Was not shure if I really wanted to read this, but more of a story line than I was hearing about.
B00AA0U046|5.0|Woah, Hendrix does it again, from the grave! This album is masterful. The addition of it being on vinyl is great! Jimi created a signature sound with his guitar that artist today wish they could have pioneered. Un-released tracks and un-heard versions of songs that ar as pleasing to the ear as they could be. Between the mellow plucking and the hard solos, Hendrix is what music is about.<br /><br />My favorite track on this album for me would have to be &#34;Hear My Train A Comin'.&#34; Bluesy, complicated riffs yet a simple implementation, catchy and fun! Just think, this track was essentially not good enough at the time of recording to be on an album. Its phenomenal.<br /><br />The vinyl cover and literature included is top notch. Highlights of Jimi's recording process and details of tracks give an in depth look at his artistic progression. A sort of metallic cover print of Jimi continues through with shots of him performing and in-studio mixing truly will bring back the 60's-70's to the 21st century.<br /><br />My mother, a woman of the 60's, truly appreciated my interest and love for the generation. She loves the album as well. All-in-all a fantastic purchase.
B0010AN7Y0|4.0|`Peter's Friends' is a pretty fun and entertaining film that has the right amount of wit and charm to make the film feel relevant and fresh, even if some of the themes are a tad out of date in today's world.  Still, there is an air of impact because of the setting and the dedication of the cast to the material.  The cast is exceptional, with stellar performances from everyone involved.<br /><br />Stephen Fry anchors the film with his soft and sincere depiction of a grown man trying for the first time to act grown.  Kenneth Branagh (who also directed the film) has a very relaxed and charismatic presence, and it bodes well for his development of character.  Thompson, Staunton and Laurie cycle the more serious roles with ease, and Emmanuel and Slattery are standouts as the new `couple' in the group.  With Rudner providing comedic relief, and Phyllida Law hanging behind as a paternal observer, this cast is to die for!<br /><br />The film opens with a hilarious and perfectly laid out sequence of six friends performing a cabaret together for the last time.  After that, shoot forward in time to friends living separate lives and far removed from each other for years (ten to be exact).  After Peter's father dies he invites all of his friends to his father's mansion for one last New Year's Eve party.  Each friend brings with them some baggage and over the course of the vacation they open those suitcases and share that baggage with everyone in the home.  Tears are shed, laughs are had and smiles cross faces; not to mention some yelling and fighting and love making.<br /><br />The dialog keeps coming and keeps the film moving, and the storyline, while a tad `step by step' in parts, is nicely woven.  It isn't a film that I'll come back to over and over, and it isn't a film that I'll look back on as a `great film' (it tries to make a serious point, or points, but it doesn't have the heft needed to really do that) but it is a very good film with a solid foundation that I can't help but enjoy.p but enjoy.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|I like seeing the good guys battle the bad guys and win.<br />I like seeing things get blown up.<br />The storyline was a little confusing but it is what it is.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE 40, AND MARRIED WITH KIDS TO ENJOY THIS MOVIE. Im 21. no kids. not married. and I get the humor. I wasnt bored not one bit. I loved it! I think alot of people can relate to this movie in some way. I love movies that have real-life situations, while having a little comedy in it. The actors/actress in this movie played their parts really well.(Except for Megan Fox) She was nothing more than eye candy in this movie. Anyways, I think the message this movie is trying to portray is great. This was a classy comedy, and I'd watch it again, and again.
B001KZG99A|5.0|It is a movie that you can look at without confusing subtexts.<br />I recommend it if you need a fun change of pace.

B00985E3UG|5.0|Salt, Sugar, Fat is an amazing book. I am about 75% of the way through it. When I go to the grocery store, I'll never look at the processed foods the same way again. It's an eye opener. I mean, I always knew that Nabisco, Kraft, General Foods/Mills weren't my friends, that they were a company trying to sell stuff. But, on the other hand, knowing that they have engineered the foods to make us overindulge which leads to obesity and all other sorts of medical problems is just mind blowing. The part about the underground caves of cheese and the dairy folks finding ever more ways to put cheese into food is yet another education.<br /><br />Anyone who wants to know what you're eating and what's really in there should read this book.<br /><br />460 billion Oreos. Just one of the many facts that Moss gives us. This is also the guy who found out about Pink Slime and told the rest of the world.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved the book and was prepared to be disappointed with the movie. I could not believe they could possibly make a film<br />true to the story.  BUT THEY DID!<br /><br />It is truly a must see. All the rewards received were justly deserved.

B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I've been a big fan of Quentin Tarantino movies for as long as he's been making them.  I always like their style, dialogue and crazy out there stories and action, but I never felt like he had more to say then he did when making this movie.  Finally, he has a historical setting which matches and in many ways excedes his extreme film making style and that alone helps bring to light a part of American history that hasn't been explored nearly enough in film, and when it has, is usually done with kid gloves on.  The most shocking parts of this film in fact are all historically accurate.  From the hotbox, to the Mandingo fighting, whips, and spiked collars, the normal Tarantino stuff (despite how good it is) with guns blazing crazy action and his quick, witty, hilarious, over the top dialogue can't even compete with the realistic/horrific images and that's a big part of what makes this movie so special and important.<br /><br />Of course it's also one of the most entertaining movies to come out in recent years.  The acting, writing, directing is all spot on, and it has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.  The cinematography is also quite outstanding.  I think people have it wrong when they just call this a blacksploitation/spagetti western genre movie, it's that, but to me it's about a knight saving his princess from the castle and in fact as far as I can tell in this way, is his first real love story.
B008UCDDQS|5.0|I grew up watching the Bruce Lee films with my dad, which is why I chose this movie. It's filled with interesting characters, Bruce's philosophy on fighting and iconic imagery. I recommend this movie to fans of Bloodsport and similar films.

B008QLXSG8|5.0|This is a classic that everyone should read at some point in their lives. I don't like that the navigation features are bare-bones.

B0041H9N4W|3.0|Not really sure what this movie is trying to be. Most people read the review before purchasing. However most reviews are misleading or waste time describing the technology used in the presentation.<br /><br />Fraternity pledges looking to find a cushy environment decide it is easier to provide a hooker than to hand themselves. The recruit a local geek (Gedde Watanabe) with money to travel to the seamy side of town to procurer their quarry; however when they meet Katrina (Grace Jones) who is the quarry?<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray so I cannot compare media. However this is not one of those movies that need any special media unless you are looking for something on Grace that I missed. Naturally voice over comments add another dimension.

1476733953|5.0|really enjoyed the book. finished all five sections in 2 days. missed some sleep, but it was so worth it.
0440237688|4.0|This is one of the best children's books I have ever read (with a few caveats). It was very short (I think I finished it in around 6 hours), and yet, although concise, it was a challenging and thought-provoking story. If God blesses me with children one day, I will most definitely encourage them to read this classic. Society needs individuals to use their God-given gifts for the betterment of the people. What will we each \\"give\\" to the world? We can either squander our talents for our own selfish gain, or put them to use to help others. I admire the courage of Jonas and the wisdom that he displays, even at such a young age. \\"Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity\\" (1 Timothy 4:12). Jonas exhibitions a love, understanding, sacrifice, and curiosity that I wish all people had. His tender innocence and sincerity is something that is missing these days; he is an example to all young people, as well as adults.<br /><br />Reservations: I strongly disliked the ending. I know that some might disagree with me, but that's just my honest opinion. The entire journey away from home, the escape from enemy jets overhead,  the near-death experiences--starvation, hypothermia, despair--and the hope for what lies \\"beyond,\\" all end in a seemingly random finale that leaves the reader \\"wondering.\\" There is absolutely no indication of whether or not Jonas truly found \\"life beyond,\\" so for all of those who boast about the confidence they have in their interpretation, I would have argue that it is inconclusive. I suppose that the ending might satisfy a young child whose imagination is willing to carry his or her thoughts into the unknown, but in all sincerity, I was just frustrated by it.<br /><br />Also, I was left in a state of annoyance as I considered both of the possible interpretations of this book's ending. Regardless of whether or not Jonas found life, does it really have much significance either way? Generations come and generations go--a civilization that exists (no matter where or when) will end relatively soon. The memories of its existence will die out like the wind. If life ends at the grave for each and every person, then life has no intrinsic value whatsoever--by implication, the courageous pursuits and adventurous plights of Jonas' life will have, in the end, meant absolutely nothing. These are the disastrous ramifications if God does not exist. This is partly why I find these kinds of books extremely unsatisfying to read. Namely, that they present a hopeful, meaningful, purposeful existence while at the same time excluding God's existence, as well as eternity. The modern American culture is one that adheres to secular humanism, thus many individuals would have read this book without even picking up on these implications.<br /><br />I understand that I have to give credit to the author's intent, and so these reservations that I have about this book, although they may seem a little aggressive, do not affect my review here. It would be unfair for me to give a poor review of a book thats purpose was much narrower in purpose than to exposit the deep metaphysical questions of life. This review simply represents my train of thought as I read the book. All in all, I recommend the book to all men, women, and above all, children. Enjoy!
B008CP93S0|4.0|A good Romcom.  Smart and quick paced.  Enjoyed it.  Not a &#34;best top 10&#34; but good to make you smile.  Enjoy it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never considered myself a fan of sci-fi.  I've always said I'd rather chew off my arm than sit and watch an episode of Star Trek, Star Wars, etc, etc.  My 80-year old neighbor recommended this series to me and she was right; I could not put it down.  The plot development is excellent.  Characters are so real that you feel like you are there with them.  I blazed through all five books of Wool and am now on the final book of Shift and find myself trying to pace myself, just to make it last longer so I won't have to wait so long for the next one.  The story line is one that keeps turning, keeping you guessing, thinking and yes, dreaming about it at night.  I'm not sure I'll become a sci-fi junkie, but for sure have become a Hugh Howey junkie!!!  Well done!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|If you like the series you will enjoy this.  Not as engaging as some of the others but I loved it anyway.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones has long been one of my very favorites. I've enjoyed all of his movies and this one is no exception. The Bayou scenery was great, too. I watched this one on my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9  -- audio was more than acceptable and the video was superb!
B008JFLWLE|4.0|A very cool concept; building equations without restricting oneself to a strict progression of beginning to end. However, there are some bugs, such as continually asking you to input a variable that doesn't exist, and after inputting the variable telling you to input another one. Aside from some minor bugs, this is a really cool idea.
0345529057|3.0|\\"Game of Thrones\\" is an excellent work of fiction. The author is extremely adept in building up characters, plots and subplots and will keep the reader enthralled through and through. However, the author seems to seriously lack the ability to resolve plots; and the book often feels very cliched in the way he deals with his various characters. The general theme of the novel seems to be to build up strong characters with excellent background stories. However, the author seems to lose his way in the plot. Finally, realizing that he can't figure out a way to successfully resolve the character's story, he terminates the characters haphazardness through a series of meaningless deaths. Great tragedies didn't involve meaningless deaths of the most important characters. When you kill off a principal character, the death should mean something, should serve a purpose. In GoT, the purpose behind so many character deaths seem vague and unresolved and appear more like the author's way of shocking the reader without any reason. And also a clever way of not having to resolve so many unresolved subplots associated with the dead character. This is why \\"Game of Thrones\\" will remain a work of fiction and will never become a classic.
B0091REZMW|3.0|this game is fun but you run out of energy quickly. it would be better if you had more energy. I like the concept of searching different rooms.

B00BF11STU|4.0|I have to admit that I am a Navy SEAL junkie since the May 1, 2011, operation that resulted in the death of Usama Bin Laden in Pakistan. I have read two separate books on the subject, one by a professional writer/military historian and one written (with help) by one of the Navy SEALS that participated in the actual operation. So it was with more than a little interest that I awaited the release of this movie. I really appreciated that the producers/directors emphasized the part of the CIA analyst, a person that I was vaguely familiar with via the other publications. I found her story just as fascinating as those stories told by the SEALS who performed the mission. I also found that the story told in the movie was just as authentic as those stories told by actual combat solders. I appreciate that we were exposed to the actual events that led up to the mission, as gruesome as some of those events were.  - That said, I really enjoyed the movie but had some problems with the video streaming. During the playback I had to stop and restart the movie several times. Although this did not detract from the story, it did detract from the total experience. I have viewed many, many movies using streaming video and have only had problems with one other movie, that was also a recent release. I must conclude that Amazon has some technical problems with high demand on its servers with first run recent releases.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|This novel is an excellent read. It continues to keep you involved and completely interested in the events and life of the character.  I couldn't put the book down. Bravo..
B00271B752|5.0|At the risk of dating myself, I loved the book, I really enjoyed the original movie production but I just adored the HD remaster. The picture quality and sound really enhanced the experience of the story and the experience of life on the streets of New York. For those of you who are not familiar with the story, Serpico is a young and idealistic New York police officer in the bad old days of rampant corruption. Trained and assigned to work undercover (plain clothes) he discovers as much crime within his ranks as on the streets. He attempts to bring the corruption to the attention of his superiors and is met with hostility and denial. In the end, he is put in harms way by his own fellow officers and is shot for his trouble. I'll not give away the entire ending ... but leave it to say that he recovers, else we would not have this riviting story. The story is in the grand tradition of French Connection but much better (at least I think so). The performance delivered by Al Pacino is, of course, superb.

B004K58GSO|5.0|This is such a classic and fun romp through the old west with veteran actors John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, James Caan and a great host of ensemble characters. I cannot add anything meaningful to the praise of the performances. I will comment on the fantastic job that was done on the HD remaster in both picture quality and depth of sound. The technicians have done a great job of enhancing an already thorougly enjoyable experience.
B002ZG98J6|4.0|First,I haven't read the books,so this is just a review on the movie alone.  My kids and I really enjoyed this action,suspense and mystery all in one. Granted this movie is no Oscar winner. But if your into family friendly movies give this a shot. I'm sure your kids will talk about it just like mine.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It was interesting to read how Lee Child brought his Jack Reacher character into being.  I had not read these books in order so it was good to go back to the first one.  Plot of the story was intriguing and kept me turning pages late into the night!  Very descriptive narrative as the action is taking place.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|Rust In Peace (1990) is one of Megadeth's best albums and one of the best metal albums of all time.  Megadeth has always sort of lived in the shadow of Metallica.  Vocalist Dave Mustaine was once a member of Metallica before being kicked out of the band in 1983.  He got revenge by forming Megadeth and ever since then these two bands have always been compared to each other.  I actually prefer Megadeth a little more than Metallica, but it's awfully close.  I saw Megadeth in concert in 2000 when they opened for Motley Crue.  Great show.<br /><br />There are a couple of tracks on this 2004 remastered album where the vocals had to be re-recorded because Capitol Records apparently lost the original vocal tracks (\\"Take No Prisoners\\" and \\"Rust In Peace...Polaris\\").  Some purists who are used to the original vocals and those fans who are curious are out of luck, I'm afraid.  But apparently it's just the two songs.<br /><br />Overall, a metal classic that's highly recommended.

B009AMANBA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and need to watch it again. Daniel Day-Lewis was excellent.  The film is a different slant on the last weeks of Lincoln's life and some may not like it.  It was a bit dark at first, but truly excellent and I especially liked how the assassination was handled.  Not the same old thing.  Excellent, and the price was very good with rapid shipping.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I heard so much about this book, how much everyone was in love with it, and how is was so wonderful. I finally thought, ok, I have got to see what all the noise is about.<br /><br />I have to say, it was horrible. The writing is absolutely horrible, and the book itself has no story. I saw one review where the person commented that these books (the trilogy) are like 'literary crack'. Knowing fully well that I hated it and that I should probably throw it away....I read the whole book! It is indeed literary crack, and sorry, but I do not mean that nicely.<br /><br />If you can, please stay away. Waste of money and time.

B005DJREJS|1.0|Why are there so many bad TV series? Who watches this stuff? Most notably the show takes a gorgeous and smart character and creates a plot in which everyone believes she is awkward and unattractive. How about dealing with this by including a real live nerd or someone struggling with her appearance? The parents are totally unbelievable as well. No depth. No real issues. Just a waste of minutes in the day.

B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Wow...I just didn't know how good this show was going to be. I started watching and couldn't put it down (my Kindle Fire that is...).The character development, story line, mystery...what a good show and a wild ride. I like scifi and mystery so this show really works for me. The tension between the characters is really well done and seeing a bit of England is fun as well...hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Moving on to season 2...
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Really the movie was almost ruined for us because of the horrible ability of Amazon to stream a movie . It took my husband and I three hours and 10 minutes to watch it. I honestly would like a $4.99 refund, doubt I'll get it though. It  wasn't my wifi service either , I tried to watch the AWKWARD series the next day on amazon instant and again,  same thing .. no problem however on Netflix . but I will rent this is 40 from a redbox and give them a proper review after I can actually watch it

If you love fantasy, you will love \\"The Legend of Drizzt\\"

B003UBTX6S|4.0|Often the second book of a series is now quite as good as the first.  Can't say that about this one.  This series is well written and hope it becomes a series of movies like Twilight did.
B009K0OL06|4.0|The only reason I don't rate it a five is because the characters talk sooo low and fast it hard to understand them if you have hearing difficulties.

B0006J28BO|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about watching this at first, but it turned out to be a really good flick.<br />Even though it's not a real long film i thoroughly enjoyed it.  A bit of mystery and adventure with some comedy thrown in, add some great characters and you've got yourself a movie.  I liked the art as well, which is a plus for me.

B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is the work of the DEVIL!  A girl used it in a store when I was wondering who the sound system was played and I was  blown away!  It hears the song playing, and within seconds shows you who it is, the album art and the video of the song, along with a dozen other treats.  DEFIES LOGIC!  I got it immediately, put on Pandora to check it out, pulled up the Kingston Trio (that's how old I am)  and with only hearing an opening guitar riff and before the Trio actually sang, Shazam identified The MTA song, with cover art.  Before the words!  Blown away ....

1451620829|4.0|I just finished this book last night. The one part which still resonates with me is when Peter discovers Ace was making $10,000 more per show during the Psycho Circus tour. Peter flips out, threatens to quit, complains about how unfair it is, ect. Well, maybe so, but he was still making $40,000 per show!!!! That is a huge amount of money. I had a very hard time feeling sorry for him at that point. Sadly, Kiss is about the money, nothing more. I am amazed that anyone would pay to see their current incarnation. While reading this I thought about how Gene and Paul's addiction to money turned them into monsters just as much as Peter's addiction to coke. I am glad that Peter came clean and dished some dirt.

B0082A3HTQ|5.0|For a film with the sensitivity of The Intouchables it takes a composer of considerable skills to marry the disparities of the characters and allow those separate needs and lives to come together musically in order to assure the impact. As a reminder of the film's story, the follow is offered: The film is an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility. After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident the aristocratic intellectual Parisian millionaire Philippe is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his secretary Magalie. Out of the blue, the rude ex-con African Driss cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Philippe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance. Philippe, impressed that Driss is the only candidate who does not look at him with pity, challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Philippe and his employees, especially under the watchful and compassionate eye of the head of the house staff Yvonne. As Driss reluctantly learns to move, feed, and clean Philippe, the two men discover a blunt but vital humor that not only bridges the cultural and class divide between them, but gives Philippe a renewed joy in life - and a chance to turn his passionate epistolary relationship with one Eleanore whom he has never seen into a chance at a second go at life.<br /><br />Ludovico Einaudi is an Italian pianist and Alt-Classical musician. After training at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan and under composer Luciano Berio in the early 1980s, Einaudi started his career as a classical composer and soon began incorporating other styles and genres, including pop, rock, world music, and folk music. He has  composed the scores for a number of films including Intouchables, I'm Still Here, and Acquario in 1996, for which he won the Grolla d'oro for best soundtrack.  For this film Einaudi's spare piano works that distill the essence of Philippe (Fly, Writing Poems, L'Origine Nascosta, Cache Cache, Una Mattina) while the world of Driss is enhanced works form Earth Wind and Fire (September, Boogie Wonderland) and George Benson (The Ghetto) and Nina Simone (Feeling Good).  And for a special moment he inserts an old 1989 recording by the Angleicum de Milan of Vivaldi's `Allegro' from Concerto for 2 Violins & Orchestra in A Minor Op. III n°8. It all works so magically that it takes waiting to hear the soundtrack alone to appreciate what an accomplishment this is. Highly recommended.

Had he never joined, DM would've been over and done with after what became \\"Construction Time Again\\" if not before. Wilder is...WAS Depeche Mode and everyone commenting on \\"Delta Machine\\" as the new \\"Black Celebration\\" may need a CAT Scan, yet so many cannot bring themselves to fathom that such a great band ACTUALLY hinged on one man, mostly. I'm not going to bother bringing up certain tracks (maybe 2) on \\"Machine\\" that sound a TAD bit like Depeche Mode...because they sound forced, labored and uninspired. With regards to Wilder, out of respect for Gore being the chief \\"songwriter\\", when Wilder joined the band he more than likely took Gore's simple 4 chord structures and painfully redundant lyrics (sin, pain, embarrassment, absolution, condemnation, redemption, etc.,  as opposed to writing lyrics more akin to how people actually speak to each other) and politely \\"tweaked\\" them (that's an understatement) with his classically trained pianist background and hyper-sonic ear for eerily dark, yet MELODIC soundscapes that, in a nutshell, catapulted Gore's demos BEYOND Gore's original intentions, into expansive, anthemic and cinematic creations that were simultaneously catchy (which is not synonymous with \\"bubble gum\\" pop that others have accused me of) as well as addictive and brooding that resonated deeply with those emerging out of puberty into the uncharted territories of the realities of relationships, sex, honesty, betrayal, loyalty, religion (especially), and the intrinsic fury that comes with entering the cold world of adulthood and, ultimately...nihilism. Yes, I am a teen of the 80's (and damn proud to be) and grew up with DM, The Smiths and most importantly the timelessly relevant...New Order. These bands shaped the inner landscape of my mind's delicate planes that were being formed, multiplied by the club tracks of the day such as the Microchip League's \\"New York New York\\" , The Airplane Crasher's \\"White Rabbit\\", Gino Latino's \\"Welcome\\", Vicious Pink's \\"5:18 To Nowhere\\", Westbam's \\"Alarm Clock\\"  Book Of Love's \\"Boy\\", Clan Of Xymox's \\"Obsession\\", \\"The Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight\\", Camouflage's \\"The Great Commandment\\" amongst many others. The 1980's was the pinnacle of multi-act, original groups, yes, some one hit wonders, but it was the last decade before the music industry stopped sitting around twiddling it's thumbs waiting for the next \\"big thing\\" to come along (other than \\"Grunge\\" which, let's admit, was a step backwards and really just the American music industry trying tofind something to call their own again as British music has always been far superior to the bland, down to earth non-escapism that made American \\"Grunge\\", for the most part, so blase).<br /><br />Back to Depeche Mode. I never thought in my wildest dreams that a band once so great could sink so low, and after FIVE albums without the member who made them so great (and who DM thought could simply be replaced by a producer) NEVER seemed to find their way back. And after this latest offering, which, by the way, I wasn't even aware of until about 6 months ago, as I felt it was IMPOSSIBLE for DM to make a record more boring and empty than \\"Exciter\\" which is EXACTLY what \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" was (which should have NEVER seen the light of day) I was shocked that they had been working on new material. My initial thoughts were along the lines of, \\"Good. They learned a lesson from SOTU and are now going to redeem themselves with some sort of defibrillator to bring themselves back.\\" Instead, Gore's African-American Father's genes appear to be at play here (they always have been really, as his lyrics have always been very reminiscent of Black church hymns in the American South) now that he's a bit due North of 50, and Gahan's love of early nineties L.A. \\"organic\\" (grunge, really) music that led him away from his band's roots, into the despair of heroin addiction and fortunate resurrection (yet still left him unchanged music-wise) combined with his newfound desire over the last few DM records to \\"write\\" music (which I have never fully understood...Gahan has never strapped on a guitar in any live performance so I'm assuming he's referring to LYRIC writing) has transformed Depeche Mode into one of two things that I can't quite put my finger on yet. 1) They have turned into the bluesy, ballady (that's Gore's default when left to his own devices, Wilder had to convince him ad nauseum to turn \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" from a ballad into what it became) band couched in electronics here and there almost as if they feel they HAVE to so as not to abandon their roots completely (which is the vibe I get if they were in control of all the aspects of their music-making such as recording music which I honestly feel they are thinking first and foremost how it will come across \\"live\\" insofar as putting on a \\"performance\\", marketing, the general \\"reality based\\" entertainment matrix we live in these days, and that the 18 -35 set never really grew up with synths) but mostly because Wilder left and none of the remaining members ever swallowed their pride and said, \\"You know, he really is responsible for our sound, and we have always kinda left him with a disproportionate amount of time in the studio re-working things, or 2) They are embarrassed of their past. I think it's a bit of both, although the first point may be more paramount as Depeche Mode has always appeared to operate with everybody \\"playing their part\\", not their instrument per se, but their \\"role\\" in the band. Gore the 4 chord demo maker, Fletch the businessman non-musician, Gahan the vocalist and Wilder the REAL GODDAMN MUSICIAN! That's NOT normal when one thinks about it which is why when Wilder left, the band has made poorer and poorer material, retained the same producer, moved further and further away from their roots to the point that Delta Machine sounds like Gahan performing guest vocals alongside an anonymous \\"house band\\" in some dive bar in New Orleans while you're yelling over the crowd to your waiter for that beer to go with your shrimp gumbo.<br /><br />People keep speaking ad nauseum about \\"evolving with the band\\" or \\"stop whining about Alan\\" or \\"get over Violator\\". NONE of these are the issue (although my refrain has always been \\"evolving is NOT synonymous w/ abandoning one's roots completely\\"). The Depeche Mode we all used to love, you know, that band whose albums DID NOT have to \\"grow\\" on you is over...and they seem to be just fine with that. What's really so sad is that had Wilderremained in the group, I can see DM having been approached to score the soundtrack for a major motion film or two (just take a listen to Wilder's current solo project \\"Recoil\\" tracks such as \\"Allelujah\\" or \\"Red River Cargo\\") and that \\"Ultra\\" would have been so otherworldly that it's almost impossible to comprehend. I believe sometime down the road, Gore, most likely, will write a biography of the band and will fess up that after \\"Ultra\\", they should have broken up. Dave was still kicking his heroin addiction back and forth between L.A. and New York, actually had to RE-LEARN how to sing, Wilder's absence was NOT being substituted by producer Tim Simenon on \\"Ultra\\", and CERTAINLY not by Ben Hillier on the last THREE outings, and quite frankly...no one was enjoying making music anymore. \\"Ultra\\" BARELY got made. I think in the future, Gore, or Gahan will say, \\"After 'Ultra', we should have called it quits and we would've eventually gone on to do our own solo stuff (as we have), but the original Depeche Mode sound would have remained unpolluted and gone down in history as such.\\" Oh yeah...almost forgot. Truly great LEGENDARY bands DO NOT play shitty annual festivals like SXSW in Austin. Period. Which, by the way, NEVER end up discovering anything promising, such as, say, White Lies. I went to college at U.T. Austin. SXSW is a festival for starving musicians, and the town is so fucking liberal that ANYBODY who gets on stage and does anything is given a huge round of applause.

B009LMTDL0|4.0|Sandberg is easy to critique because she is successful and can afford a cadre of servants to help her do what most of us women have to do by ourselves. All the same, I think she makes a good point about the way women are treated in the workplace and about the way it shapes their views about themselves. Reading her book made me think about the way that I present myself, and I am making changes. I am working hard to eliminate qualifiers from my statements (things like, &#34;It seems to me that....&#34; or &#34;In my opinion...&#34;) and I am absolutely done with worrying about the fact that, when I am passionate about something, my emotions show. As she points out, the alternative for me is to keep quiet, and that comes at too high a cost. Sandberg's right about the fact that women need to work together better, and that they need to be more brave and confident in how they present themselves in the workplace. Is she right about everything? No. But she makes a number of points worth considering, and she has sparked some interesting and valuable conversations. Her book mades me think, and it has inspired me to read more on this subject.

It had the feel of a good Gothic novel with ghosts, mystery and suspense.<br />It is the story of a young boy's visit to his grandmother's home in the country.  He was sent to his grandmother's while his mother searches for his father, who is missing at the end of WWII.<br />While visiting, he becomes aware of a mystery in the family mansion, which has been owned by his family for centuries.  The<br />grandmother is afraid they are going to lose the house, due to taxes and high costs after the war.  Through his efforts, trying to solve the mystery, he may be able to save the house for himself and future generations.  But first,  he must discover the hidden mystery about the house, his ancestors, and a very old family secret.<br />It was a wonderful evening's entertainment.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|This was a wonderful purchase that I do not regret for a second. It's very useful and efficient! I simply love it!
B00821OX98|4.0|I thought this would be like any other alien vs human fight for the world, in which it is basically but the way the story line plays out keeps me entertained. Nicely done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is ssoo fun:) Its really addictive and a great way to kill time<br />Recommended for anyone with a kindle:)
B009FZFONO|5.0|I truly love this show.  It is not just about zombies (which would still be fine by me), rather it is more about the human condition and what we may become after an event of apocalyptic proportions.  A lot of folks get bogged down by the dialogue, but I find it interesting to think of how people would change in a situation like this.<br /><br />Even in the 3rd season they manage to keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering who will make through each episode. Love it, love it!
0385349947|5.0|This is an excellent book! Using research and entertaining, sometimes horrifying, anecdotes from her own career, Sandberg examines the state of gender inequity in the workplace, especially in industry leadership roles. Despite criticism of blaming the victim, she makes a compelling argument that women can hold themselves back through poor decision making and behavior stemming from feelings of inadequacy. She discusses the most common issues facing women in the workplace and offers practical advice for overcoming obstacles. A must read for working women and any men who are serious about helping women succeed and achieve their goals.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The different prespective parents have on there own children.  The sad reality of confronting issues with our children and dealing with the consequences of their actions.  The blame we feel and the guilt we carry.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book is a hot mess. It is trying too hard to be everything and ends up short on all plot lines.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Overdone on the torture scenes. It illustrated Maya's struggle and persistence against the institutionalized burocracy within her peers at CIA.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|This soundtrack has been the theme to my research paper.  Whenever I need to concentrate I put it on and get to work.  Great soundtrack!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game will challenge you and yet it can be won. It moves quickly and there are several choices of deals. Another plus is the \\"hint\\" key. All in all, a most enjoyable game.
1451695195|5.0|I'm just getting back into the spiritual life and this was one of the first books that I read recently and I found it extremely inspirational and enjoyed it very much
B000I8G5B2|5.0|I was so excited to find this on Amazon. I Love this movie and the questions it brings up.<br />Only downside was I did not know this was not going to download to my computer... :(
B005R9HK8O|4.0|I decided to get this after watching the biography of Ram Dass Fierce Grace, and enjoyed the book very much. Lots of helpful guidance
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|i have told several people to get this cd buddy still brings it, if you get the chance to see buddy in person, do it you will not be disappointed, hes great
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Love it love it love it!!!!! Could this BEEEEEE any better? Only if Sawyer becomes real and visits me! :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|Enjoy MobilityWare games.  Easy to play and very addictive.  Find it hard to put down my tablet once I get started.
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|I really dislike the &#34;runner&#34; style game like Temple Run; but I thought keeping an open mind, I'd give this one a try anyways. That being said I am really glad I did. I like that you can control the direction going back if you missed something. Simply put it's much more fun than I thought it would be.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the game as addictive temple run but ten times more interesting...I love it. Go get it. It's free and hours of fun
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. I could never guess what was going to happen and the blending of old technology (books) that get entwined with new technology (internet/computers) was very appealing. It has a heart and a great sense of humor.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a female in the IT industry for over 33 years, I could relate to many of the issues and suggestions Sheryl illustrated very clearly. Thanks for writing this book, it brought to light many of the issues that need addressing not only by women themselves but also the men in our workplaces.  I have recommended this book to my daughters, husband, and friends of all ages.
B000FA5STS|2.0|After the first ten pages, if that, i put the book down as it did not grab my attention. In addition, it was not easy to see where the author was going with his thought processes in writing this book. Maybe boring is not fair; however, if a book doesn't grab me within the first ten pages, i won't waste my time with it.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|This is my first Jack Teacher book. Everyone has been telling me to read him. I can see why. I can hardly put it down. It's riveting and you just have to know what's coming next.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|This is one of the best shows that ever aired on the television. The cast is amazing and it is simply wonderful how they have such a great chemistry. It all comes together to work beautifully. The best part is that it is such good clean fun for the whole family. You can show it to children with no fear of any ludenesss. Awesome show!!!!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Fun game to play, takes a little bit to get use to controlling the plane. Graphics are really good on the kindle HD.  Kids found it on my kindle and play it all the time.
B00BYOEZTI|2.0|I'm not a big fan of the Lord of the Rings because to me they are boring. This one was no different. The filming was amazing but the story was less than exciting.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Very enjoyable read!  Read it in 2 days!  I'm already on the 3rd book.<br /><br />The story moves along quite well and the characters have enough depth to understand motives, temperament and history without going into long protracted flashbacks in nauseating detail.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This minecraft game is the best I have seen and with the updates it will get better and I like to play with<br />friends to that is why I say 5 stars.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is a great game to play. There are plenty of different tasks to complete in order to continue on. This game also has a decent story line even though it's a creation- zoo game.
B00696D0EM|5.0|Loved this.  It was a real page turner and didn't want to put it down.  The plot kept you guessing all the way through.  Lots of little twists which is typical of JA.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this series. Plot twists, endearing characters, nail-biting scenes. I am looking forward to reading more by Howey!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The story was one of Grisham's best.  I am a John Grisham fan.  The book compares to my other favorites, such as The Firm.
B0064MGU98|3.0|Really good acting and great production values, but I really don't care what happens to anybody. I think the problem is in the script; it just doesn't draw us enough into the characters. A lot of people love this show and I really wanted to. It just has a been-there-done-that vibe for me.
B0087EACJK|5.0|I love it and this game suits me just fine! I am not a hardcore gamer  Simple concept, no difficult controls to remember in a sequence. Pretty fast making changes - you are not in a holding pattern waiting for a game scene to form.  Controls are simple finger movements, instructions are simple.  move the figure to get the key and then get to the door and rise thru the levels.  You are timed and the game will show your time compared to the ideal time. Challenges are move thru TILE SCENARIOS in a way for the figure to collect the key and get to the door (even if it means you have to turn the device you are playing on). This is the game to play if you were trying to pass a short period of time or a few hours.  Easy to put down if you needed to stop and take care of something or if your child is playing you know you will not have to wait 15 minutes to get them to do something.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My toddler likes to play this game and so do I until he broke my tablet. Also true gangsters wear Angry Birds t-shirts.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|this movie had some good humor and I was very glad to see that the movie trailer did not give away all the good parts. a very good watchand everyone in the house was able to enjoy it.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen and part of the reason is the musical score. I am so glad I purchased this soundtrack because now when I don't have the time to sit down and watch the movie I can still listen to the soundtrack!
B005HSL626|4.0|A friend of mine introduced to Fruit Ninja a few month ago and I thought it was one the best apps/games made in a long time. Its a good game to relieve stress; having a bad day at work/school, play Fruit Ninja; upset about something, play Fruit Ninja; if today is just not your day, play Fruit Ninja. Try it, I think you'll like it plus its free!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I'm hooked. Great characters throughout. The greatest part of the narrative is that no character is safe. They can go down at anytime.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think Subway Surfers is the best game ever! I love playing it, it is so fun to play! Its awesome!
B00846REIS|5.0|A lot Better than the 50 Shades series. I have read it at least 5 times in the past 5 months. Can't wait for the third book to come out.
B000025JMP|5.0|I strongly recommend this album because it shows great work at the studio combined with his show at Vegas. awsome!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it's just like you're owning your own horse because you feed it groom it and everything
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I enjoyed the journey of belle and Lavinia, the idea of a slave and indentured servant, how different but the same.  Very good for book club discussion.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A good and quick read.  Read the book before the movie, for it is way better.  If you like reading about connections between humans and animals, it is right up your alley.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|By the time it came to use my mic. It was not working. I haven't even gotten to use my mic and it is not working.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved reading this book! It really makes you stop & think about things. Definitely recommend reading this book. It's great!
B008602KQI|4.0|Like many others, I am sort of wondering how or why this is considered &#34;young adult fiction&#34; other than the fact that the primary protagonists are teenagers.  This was a great read (and movie watched) for *this* adult, although I will admit that I found some of the violence a little gratuitous if not outright over the top.  I'm not entirely sure I would want my younger teenagers reading this based simply on the amount of violence.<br /><br />The political intrigue, the clever blending of current political and social trends into the plot and story itself, all very well done.  Simply a great read, whether &#34;young adult&#34; or just plain adults.  But I would draw the line, say, around age 14 or so in terms of exposure to that &#34;young&#34; audience.  This could easily have just been classified &#34;fiction.&#34;  Most interesting dystopian story I have read or watched since some of the masters of the game, Orwell and Rand, and that is considerably high praise.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|The first song on this album is also the title and kicks off this new selection of new songs wonderfully. I have liked BonJovi for 20 plus years now and they still have the energy they always had. Jon's voice remains just as good as always and this album will not disappoint you. I recommend the purchase of this album for anyone that loves this group.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I don't use the 3D option and am frustrated that there is a 2 or 4 pack option only.  I really enjoyed this movie and glad to have the digital option, especially when on a plane.  Despite it containing 4 discs, the packaging is streamlined enough to look like any of my other blu-ray cases - less bulky is good in my mind.<br /><br />I haven't paused it - because it's always just playing, but apparently easter eggs are shared when you do.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. I hope there will be more. I wish there wasn't a minimum of words to write.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Received the DVD and it was perfect! No scratches. Played nicely on my dvd player. Happy with my purchase! Thanks!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|It isn't fair. This show is too good. The actors are too good, the storyline is too good, and it's all too perfect. I can't wait for each episode. It's practically physically painful!! This is a great show. The lead actor is even stronger and has even more charisma than Jax on Sons of Anarchy, the storyline has as much action as Supernatural, and as much suspense as The Walking Dead. A show not to be missed.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I love everything about this movie and the songs are so wonderfully treated with the emphasis on &#34;Less is more&#34;
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Sam's emotional drama is a bit wearying and boring this season. He's as sexy as ever, but that's not enough to carry him. Dean's comic timing and polished acting ability and the witty, witty writers save the show. For now. Sam better get his ass in gear, though, because it sort of seems like he's losing his edge.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly is a great way to manage news feeds.  I find it superior to the readers I have used before.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is so fun and cute and addictting and it,s nice to have a virtual Resturant and have choices to Expand your Resturant ,Thanks
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Don't know if it was me or the book but this is the first 4 star I'v given Child.  Good book for sure but somehow didn't hit me like all the others have. I still recommend it though.... Reacher is great.
B00008NRI7|5.0|This Movie Is Very Good And The Disc Was Not Scratched when I got The Movie in the Mail,thanks alot
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|As one who grew up in the 80's, this book was great.  It took me back to my own high school days.  The author knew what she was writing about in this book.  She brought back those feelings of first love, combined with classic 80's hits that I haven't thought about in years.  I loved this book.
B0064QNS62|5.0|This a video type Game like When you are in an Arcade game room and the game is so cute and addicting too
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|A very enjoyable read. I couldn't put it down! I was a child when Kennedy was killed and I have some memories of this time.
B002ZG9968|5.0|This Movie Is Funny But Could of done without the bad words and it,s nice ,sad, happy and at times you get frustrated with jlo with her trials and there are some awkard scenes too which in Reality would be Crazy if They Really Happen otherwise this movie is a good slapstick funny Movie and Jeniffer,s Acting is so good and she can Relate to Some of  This Movie Because She Has Twins In Real Life
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I love Enya, and everything she did with her music.  I have most of her recorded albums.  This was such a good deal, I really appreciate the offer.  I would tell anyone who has enjoyed Enya's recordings in the past, to get this.  I listen to her on my iPad Mini by using the Amazon Cloud.  Thanks to Amazon, and also to Enya.....Arthur Decker, Bristol, Ct
0800141849|5.0|I Love This Movie That,s Why I got it And The Dvd Shipped Fast anad The Disc is Not Scratched I made a  very Good Choice,Thanks
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a classy entertaining series that pulls you in.  I wish there were more shows like this on tv!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I didn't want to put it down! I didn't know much about OCD- Ifelt like I learned something by reading it. Good ending!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This book reads like an action novel vice an IT book.  I read this book in 2 days while on vacation.  I couldn't put the book down! , This book is the best blend of Lean & ITIL service I've read to date.  I gleaned lots of ideas that I'll take back to work to research & hopefully implement in the near future.
B004TL3R24|5.0|This strap is perfect for moving your tripod around.<br /><br />Its lightweight and clips on perfectly to the tripod.  The strap is nice and padded.<br /><br />The strap could be 6 inches longer to make it a little easier for a tall person like myself, but it works just fine extended to its farthest position.<br /><br />Just a tip, after you set up the tripod you can clip the loose end back up around the top to stop it from dragging on the ground.  Swinging it thru your camera bag handle is an easy way to swing some ballast onto the tripod to weight it down a little bit more.<br /><br />If you have a 055, or 190 series tripod, this strap is perfect.  A little pricey for a strap but it works well.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I absolutely loved the final book of this series.  A lot of twists and turns, couldn't put it down. Great finale.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Wonderful description of what is important in our busy lives. The perspective is enchanting. Really makes you think about how you spend your time.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Very well written, gives a new understanding of the link between Quantum Physics and Biology. I recommend this book to students and those who seek further knowlwedge.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|I understood the timeline of &#34;renting&#34; a movie from amazon.  i had to stop it like 5 minutes into it due to being called into work and coulnt get back to watching it 2 days afterwards.  of course the time expired and just wasted my money.  I wish amazon would base a rental on the timeline of the movie rather than a time period of the rental.  of well.  :(
B007URVZJ6|5.0|When I needed a guide to help me build a book for publishing on Kindle this was a great reference! It was easy to follow and made things simple. Plus, it was free! Highly reccommend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead Season 3 is by far the best season yet I can not wait until season 4 comes out.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|Make sure you have a lot of energy, and don't read the book first.  It's a long long movie and will ruin the memory of your childhood book.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|beautiful story about the resilience of the human spirit.  really wonderful performances; I'm surprised this movie didn't get more oscar attention.
B008GWSS6W|5.0|I've always been a John Wayne fan and have watched his movies over and over . Lilke them everytime.will probably watch again
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I first read Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit in 1967, so I've been a fan for a long time.  I thoroughly enjoyed the three Rings movies but this telling of the Hobbit is wonderful.  It's treated like a straight out fairy tale, which is very different from the dark, somber tones of the three Rings movies.  In this movie the dwarves and Frodo get thrown around, bashed, buried under rocks, fall off cliffs, almost get eaten by trolls....and come up fighting every time!  You just can't kill them!  The scenery is delightful, both the good and the bad, and the dialogue is frequently witty, while sticking very close to some of the dialogue in the book.  I enjoyed the fact that the dwarves are different sizes and shapes, not just clones of one another, and with very different personalities from one another, again not just clones.  I loved meeting Radagast the Brown in person, along with his woodland friends.  I hope Tom Bombadil turns up somewhere in the next two movies.  This is a movie good enough to watch again....and maybe again.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|It was great. Kept me in my sit. Just like the other Bourne movies. Aaron Cross  is very good. Just don't change the Charaters
B007NESBK2|5.0|This show was the most professional production I have ever seen in a concert dvd.  This band is top notch!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|It wasn;t what I excepted.  I know I won't rewatch it. Like I do some.  It did leave me wanting more.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|this thing has saved me because i own case for iPhone that will not take some 30 pin cords because of design flaws
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!<br /><br />So many people made me think this book was something it is not. This book captures an untraditional love story, and although there are quite a few sex scenes, it is nothing unusual.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys.Clancey Demille Ludlum etc  Mr Flynn is in good company with his gandra
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was as good as the first, if not better! I felt the emotions of the characters all through the story. I'm looking forward to reading the third book!
0811879542|5.0|My little 2 and 3 year old grandsons pick this one as one of their favourites. It's not just a book, it's also a fun, interactive toy. We read it every time we are together. They are delighted to watch what happens to the yellow dot, and so am I!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The story, the characters, the vision - WOW.  It was so hard to put down.  I was looking for a book to really sink into - and this has been perfect.  I am sooooo glad there's a book 2!!
B006JJBFK0|5.0|Ok, my review for this album is so long overdue. I purchased this here last year when it first came out, just been too busy to review this, but really...what else is there to say about this awesome album that hasn't been said already? First of all, I want to welcome the hot and beautiful new front-woman, \\"Manuela Kraller\\"! She is so easy on the eyes just as Lisa was, I can't get enough of watching Manuela on the \\"Valentine\\" video! Ok, so straight to the point, the first time I played this album, I was like \\"WOW...Xandria? Really?\\" in a great astonishing good way. Any fan that has followed Xandria know what I mean, prior to this album, Xandria was more Gothic with a little hint of symphonic thrown in there. Now, with this album, it's like...symphonic all the way with that gothic vibe in there. Just as everyone has said on here, this is like listening to the Tarja-era of Nightwish, and that's not a bad thing. There isn't one single weak track on here, even the 2 bonus tracks are awesome! Of how awesome this album is, I wonder if the band worked around Manuela's voice, or this was the original route the band intended. Either way it works so perfectly! I normally pick out my favorites on an album, but because I love all 14 tracks there is no need!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|There are times this book took the war a bit too far, got a bit droll.  BUT the characters continued to build, and the key players became far more interesting.  So, mix the bitter with the sweet - it's still a great read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My kids like the colorful action and play often.  It is a nice diversion when we're at the doctor's office.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The twists and turn, plots and subplots - wonderful.  Characters developed further than I imagined possible.  FABULOUS.  Again, an enticing read.  A series that is easy to love.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Once you get over the initial scene of the fist episode, this show is great! Definitely a good story line & I would recommend watching it!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Still engrossed in the story lines.  Although there were times that the story took me so by surprise I had to put the book down.  At one point I was down right angry by the twist in the story; I put the book down for 2 weeks before I calmed down.  Then I picked it back up, drawn to find out what happened to the rest of my favorite characters, and haven't been disappointed since.  It was pleasantly surprising to have been taken so off guard, to have gotten so &#34;into&#34; the book that I had to force a step back into reality.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|Absolutely love the twilight movies! The chemistry with these actors are incredible! Love it..a must have to your movie collection.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I was living out of the country when these events were taking place so it was all news to me. I was so impressed with every aspect of this film and the accompanying documentary. Ben Affleck made so many good choices when putting this together. His cast, cinematographer, composer, casting director and of course, writing....all of it was top notch. I was on the edge of my seat in that wonderful &#34;Hollywood&#34; way that happens so rarely these days. I think the film deserved the Oscar and I look forward to what Affleck chooses to do next.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Love this app.  It's great that you can have more than one city to check for weather.  A must app for all.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved everything about this production. In truth, I think it's at least as good and in a few moments, better than Downton Abbey. The cast is just incredible. In fact, Downton Abbey stole the leading man from Larkrise and turned him into Mr. Bates! I'm surprised that this show never took off in popularity the way that one did because it is every bit as good. I was very sad that there were only 3 seasons of it! I bought it as a gift for my family and it's gotten lots of play.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Very glad to find feedly. The setup to pull over my G Reader feeds was axsnap: just plug in ky gmail address, and feedly populates all the RSS feeds I had (not just a few). Easy to scroll thru.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|It give me a lot of motivation to workouts. It actually works great and I started to noticing that I have abs and bone lines! :)

B00BBW16HW|5.0|Do not miss this one. I laughed and cried. One of the best feel good movies in a long time!!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is an inexpensive cover to have for the Kindle Fire. You don't have to worry about scratching the screen surface and it doesn't add much to the weight.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game very addicting. Wow this is about the best game almost 1st in all my friends keep playjng and try hard.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I enjoy trying to figure out how to work this little game. Frustrating more often than not because of the long wait to set up the game again to play. Other things show up that need to be bypassed to get back to game.. suspect it is that I am not used to the workings yet.
B000JMKO3C|5.0|Great book. It makes you see what the so called insane people are not really insane. But just like Paulo C. says, what's insanity?
B0045HCJ8U|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES EVER!! I ABSOLOUTELY ADORE MARLON BRANDO AND VIVIEN LEIGH &#60;3<br />THE VOLUME IS TOOOOOOO LOW!!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Good guide for people who simply want to publish their home made e-book.<br /><br />This guide covers the following things:<br />&#62; How to format your kindle e-book, through word.<br />&#62; How to make a book cover.<br />&#62; How to upload your book.<br /><br />For a free book, this is a wonderful deal. People who are out there though who want more advanced info would need to buy a official 10$ book, but I myself find it totally useless and a waste of money.<br /><br />One thing to make clear is that if you want to insert a bookmark for kindle users to use your book eassier you will need to insert a bookmark through word on the highlighted text and give it the name  toc  . Dont ask me why.<br /><br />I am going to go through some of the basics to make it more clear for some people:<br /><br />&#62; ALWAYS INSERT PAGE BREAKS After titels, end of chapters and end of section. To make it clear simply put a page break after something when you are going to skip the rest of the page (Half the page isnt filled in or after contents page for example).<br />&#62; Spacing between paraghraphs needs to be 10 pt.<br />&#62; images try not to insert any at all if its the case you will have o read a long part of this book to learn and see how hard and annoying it is to insert a image! Ratio is 1:6 those who want to know.<br /><br />My hands are getting tired so I cant say more. If you interested in more info and want to write a book simply take the book. It is free so what have you got to lose!<br /><br />Benjamin L. Whelan

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good story, fun plot. Some of the puzzles are difficult to operate as tapping on certain items brings up the back button instead of operating the item. Other than that I really liked it. Waiting impatiently for the hopefully awesome sequel.
B001LIBRL6|4.0|I have not seen this movie since I was a teenager, but I still enjoyed it. Loved Woody's take of Casablanca. He is a scream. For years may sibs have been using this catch phrase... give me the letter!

B004NBYRXS|1.0|Wasnt able to watch it. Says playback is not supported by region code. Apparently it was sent from London which shouldnt have been sent if they knew. Now it costs more to send it back than the actual product so im dissapointed.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great graphics. I would recommend if you like hidden objects games and quest. I did get stuck in a few places where the game would not let me go past a certain point, I played under a different name and then it let me through. Otherwise a good game.

1455523003|5.0|Christopher Hitchens' book is a blistering indictment of the cult of Mother Teresa. It investigates systematically the innards of Mother Teresa's charity in Calcutta and exposes it mostly as a sham with a great chasm lying between myth and reality. Hitchens is an anti-thiest (as he likes to call himself) and so has no sympathy for religion and belief in God. Still, this book is purely a rational exercise in simply evaluating Mother Teresa's reputation by her actions and words instead of the other way around. In doing so, he finds that the Mother is just one more 'holy' person of dubious distinction. For me as an Indian, it is a familiar tale, as India is so full of fraudulent Gurus and Swamis who amass money, selling the idea of Liberation and Heaven to gullible devotees and followers.<br /><br />Contrary to the widely-publicised image of Mother Teresa as a compassionate nun saving countless number of poor Indians from dying, Hitchens demonstrates the following to be the truth:<br /><br />1. That the Calcutta charity did not like to spend its vast wealth in providing care to save the sick and dying. It rather spent the money on establishing more convents across the world, all doing similar dubious work.<br />2. That it was a Catholic cult based on glorifying poverty, suffering, subjection and death. The cult was focused on prosyletization above saving lives. The dying poor were allowed to die, but die as Christians, because then only Jesus would save them. Towards this end, sick and dying Indians of other faiths would be brought to the charity and baptized, often without their knowledge, as they lay awaiting death.<br />3. That the conditions in the so-called 'hospital' of the Calcutta charity were often unhygienic and the staff poorly trained. They re-used needles over and over and washed them in cold, tap water instead of sterilizing them. Many inmates died not because they were incurable but because the charity wouldn't spend the money necessary to save them.<br />4. That Mother Teresa took multi-million dollar donations from shady and dubious characters like Charles Keating, Papa doc Duvalier and others and repaid the debt by interceding on their behalf. For example, she wrote to Judge Lance Ito in support of Charles Keating, who cheated ordinary hard-working Americans to the tune of $250 million.<br />5. That she was just a reactionary figure who advocated the rights of the unborn child even as she let adults and children  under her care die for lack of desire to spend money to save them;  that she glorified poverty and suffering and denounced materialism even as she sought and accepted millions of dollars as donations.<br /><br />There is a thread that links people like Mother Teresa and the other high-profile Gurus and Swamis in India. It is not a surprise that they all tend to be reactionary, have outmoded views and are mostly out of touch with the pulse of society. Most of the Gurus tend to be people who grew up in rural parts of India in the 1930s and 1940s, when the social mores were highly repressive compared to today. Women were terribly discriminated against and constrained, caste oppression was pervasive and illiteracy was rampant. These gurus would have often only had a few years of religious education which mostly reinforced such prejudices. They were often un-exposed to secular science based education. Much later, when they get anointed as Swamis by some vested interests in urban India, they bring all their baggage into their 'liberating' Ashrams. Often, men and women are severely segregated in these ashrams because that is what the gurus know society to be. They are often against women's education and empowerment. They often patronize the rich and powerful and practise caste discrimination. In a similar way, Mother Teresa grew up in a rural Albanian/Macedonian region in the 1930s and had only church-influenced education. She also never had any exposure to the enlightened European education. So, it is not a surprise that she is against contraception in an India that sought to reduce population growth. It is not a surprise that she thought that abortion is the biggest crime. It is not a surprise that she patronized frauds like Duvalier and Keating because they gave her big donations and professed themselves to be good Christians.<br />Christopher Hitchens has done a great service by tearing the mask of such people who think that they have a hotline to God.<br /><br />The book is written in Hitchens' trade-mark style of hard-hitiing prose. One can see it even in the choice of the title. As an example, I would cite the following:<br />Commenting upon the decision of advice columnist Ann Landers to share one of Mother Teresa's prescriptions for improving the world (\\"smile more\\"), Hitchens writes,\\" ...it is doubtful whether a fortune-cookie maxim of such cretinous condescension would have been chosen by even Ann Landers unless it bore the imprimateur of Mother Teresa, one of the few untouchables in the mental universe of the mediocre and the credulous\\".<br />This is vintage Christorpher Hitchens!<br /><br />The book is not a polemic but a well-argued, rational critique. In fact, the foreword to the twelfth edition by Thomas Mellon sums up the book so well that one can hardly do better in a review. I loved it.urprise that she is against contraception in an India that sought to reduce population growth. It is not a surprise that she thought that abortion is the biggest crime.

B003THHIEM|4.0|It just took 1 episode to get hooked on this show. It has all anybody really needs in a TV show. The only downside is that its not a full season but that is what happens when  a show starts mid season. Delivery was prompt and on time and in one piece. If you are looking for a great show then Castle would be a awesome choice.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|As a lifelong devotee of Sherlock Holmes in print and in many film (cinema and television) versions, I had low expectations of this realization of Holmes and Watson, and didn't watch any episodes until one night in the hospital.  I was hooked!  Have gone back and caught up with the series on Amazon Video, and am very happy to see that CBS has ordered a second year of episodes.  Although completely leaping centuries and continents from late Victorian England to 21st century New York City, Holmes and a more fully realized Watson stay true to Conan Doyle's characters and continue to fascinate me.
B0088ETCHW|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to lean to swim with a good technique<br />I used to swim without any proper technique for short distances only. So I decided to join swimming classes. I also came across this book on the Internet.<br />It is very useful for me, as it made me understand many aspects of swimming and the trams used. It makes you understand your mistakes and gives you ways and drills to solve them.<br />I love the book and read it all the time. I thinking is a great aid for Anyone trying to improve their swimming.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations, and I understand why it remains on the best-seller lists! For me the book centered around a cat & mouse game for control of a marriage gone terribly wrong. The journal entries written by the wife that were interspersed with the husband's narrative were haunting. Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down. Surprises and twists--many that I never expected--kept me hooked well into the night . . .
B0090O07RS|5.0|If you watch the specials after the concert, they will explain how they pieced together the &#34;lost parts&#34; of the performance. Quite amazing! Anyway, I went to the Hollywood Bowl a couple years past on a Star Tour of Hollywood. I got to see the Bowl for the first time, and immediately thought of Jim Morrison and the Doors. So, as soon as I heard this was on Blu-Ray, I was like, &#34;Hell yeah, I'm getting this&#34;. Was and AM not disappointed. Great show, great re-mastered footage.

1476734941|3.0|Done properly, the 5:2 and various intermittent fasting diets provide a lot of benefits associated w/weight loss. However, one thing that is avoided in the discussion is the link between IGF-1 (the marker for cancer risk and other risks) and fasting. Mr. Mosely's IGF-1 dropped a lot in the short term. But there is evidence to suggest that over the long run such caloric restrictions don't have a lot of impact on IGF-1. In general, compared w/folks who do nothing, people who exercise and burn 20-25% of their daily caloric needs show the same sorts of weight-related changes as people who eat 20-25% fewer calories than they need. The difference between the two groups (in 1 year and in 6 year long studies!) is not significant. But, when matched w/vegans that had 25% lower PROTEIN intake and who ate the same amount of calories as experienced calorie-restrictors, the vegans had significantly lower IGF-1. When the calorie restricting group then changed their percent of protein intake w/o altering calories, they too had IGF-1 decrease.<br /><br />If you watched the Mosley documentary, during his 4 day fast he ate miso soup...not very high protein intake, even for the 40-50 calories it provided. The calorie restricted person he first introduces us to is eating mostly fruits and vegetables...<br /><br />In our protein-addicted society (and I say that as a protein addict myself), this is an important factor to take into account.<br /><br />For details see: \\"Long-term effects of calorie or protein restriction on serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentration in humans\\" by Fontana, et al. in the journal Aging Cell, Volume 7, Issue 5, pages 681-687, October 2008. It's freely available to read online, or was when I looked it up.
B000007ODM|5.0|What hits me most with this self titled release by eRa is the absolute seamless melding of fantastic electric guitar work and gregorian style chanting. The atmosphere is electric in another almost dimension.  I have no idea who the guitarist is but in my mind he/she is in the same calibre as David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. As David has said, it's not what you play but what you don't that counts. The singing is just as spectacular as is the musical arrangements. I can understand basically none of the singing, not sure what language it is, or even it is a language. Who needs language when listening to music. music should speak directly to the soul and this does. 5 stars.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|My daughter read this book in 2 days on line...I didn't need to encourage her and she asked for more!  It is every parents dream to get their child to read and this series seems to do just that...and the price is reasonable compared to the bookstore chains!
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|I guess I should have read the reviews and found that this was not a regular Cirque du Soleil release. Had I done so, perhaps I would not have ordered it.<br /><br />So glad I didn't. Yes, the first few minutes to me by surprise, completely unexpected. I then went back to Amazon and read more reviews. I had no idea what to expect then. Someone wrote: Don't try to understand it, because you won't. Just hang on and enjoy the ride (or something like that)<br /><br />Great advice. I actually loved it. There were so many amazing acts and the story line was way different, but totally enthralling. What a beautiful love story it is.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun and easy to understand. although my children are too young for it. complicated enough that it keeps your attention

0060763280|5.0|This book changed our lives by changing our way of thinking about, and using money.  This is not a get rich quick money scheme.  Just simple, clear, easy to implement concepts that, if your are willing, absolutely change your relationship with money.  By changing this relationship with money we have grown our business, saved more money than ever, and are now looking into creating a passive income for ourselves. I recommend this book to any one is not exactly where they  want to be financially.  This should be a must read for every student 5th grade and up, maybe younger.  I LOVE IT and have purchased numerous copies for freinds and family
B000OVLBF8|2.0|At the time in which I'm writing this review, amazon.com is offering the movie at $5.  It might still be too much for this film.  Sure, Ghost Rider looks cool and does some fun stuff, but that's about the only saving grace for the film.  The acting is borderline abysmal with the exception of the gravedigger with the shady past.  He's pretty spiffy.  But Nicholas Cage and Eva Mendes fall short of the mark.<br /><br />Marvel movies often seem to be hit or miss and this is a miss, most definitely.  Although there are some funny moments and some parts are entertaining, the action is hardly worth mentioning and whatever \\"battles\\" you're expecting can be thrown out the window.  Wes Bentley plays Blackheart and he might as well be an emo reject child who does relatively little except for turning people into dehydrated looking corpses.  Peter Fonda plays a poor Mephistopheles as well.  His final moments in the movie are akin to his emo son.  There are deaths, of course, but when there are you are not moved by them.  There's a distance between you and the characters with little hope of emotional salvation.<br /><br />The graciousness of the two stars I delivered was because, as I said, there are some cool scenes and some funny moments.  That, at least, makes the movie somewhat entertaining.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|It's not bad and it's not good. App is kind of sluggish. Intro between every game detracts from play. Definitely not Bejeweled.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|It is similar to the applet provided in a phone with a ultra light led, although KFHD does'nt have it. The applet works fine.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This was an adorable continuation of Something Borrowed. I found that Something Borrowed left me hanging at the end, and this tied up loose ends perfectly. Everyone loves a happy ending, right?
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is brilliant. From Eye of the Needle to this masterpiece Trilogy, he has captivated me for decades with his precise and thrilling storytelling. Winter of the World will not disappoint anyone who has read the first two novels. I highly recommend this book, as well as the entire Trilogy. Follett's research, always on &#34;point&#34;, of the true facts of each timeline, woven into his keenly developed characters' triumphs and struggles is amazing. What a triumph for Ken Follett!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Someone reading the synopis of this book is not looking for a feel-good story, I don't think. That being said, it was truly eye-opening and gave a good insight into the unending love of a mother. An interesting perspective on our society that made me want to do more research.

B003FXCSNQ|2.0|Dick has interesting ideas, but he doesn't bother to set them up in ways that are plausible, leading to an overall feeling of contrivance and illogicality. There's also a perfunctory quality about his prose, which is a serious liability in a work whose central theme is empathy. It simply isn't possible to feel anything for characters and situations that are drawn so thinly.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|Lucky me.<br /><br />I had heard about this program a number of times but it is an HBO product, so I wasn't able to see it. My provider here in town is Comcast, and they have an 'On Demand' feature. I clicked it last week, I think Tuesday, and there was a button called 'Watchathons'. All of the shows listed were free until the thirty first of March. I scanned them quickly, not really thinking much about it as I was looking for something else, and there it was. A Game of Thrones. 2 season's worth. I had Tuesday through Sunday to view. What I was searching for forgotten, I saddled up for a long ride in my spare moments after work.<br /><br />I was hooked from the first episode. This series is absolutely incredible and well worthy of the high acclaim it has received. Fastforward to Sunday, and I had viewed all of the first two seasons. (I think Comcast screwed the pooch Sunday night because I was able to see the first episode of season three as well.) What to do after seeing such an epic in such a short period of time? First, I bought the 4 volume set of books. Now, I tried to do this through Amazon, but they were out of stock, so I found a local dealer what had it. I'm now about 300 pages into the first book, and man... The HBO series follows so closely to the book, it's like reliving it in print! Incredible how alive the series makes the characters. The production is epic, with what would seem no expense spared. Vivid and visceral. Intricate and involved.<br /><br />2 days later, here I was on Amazon buying the DVDs for the first two seasons, and as soon as able, will be buying season three. How could I not? With the books, you get the scope of what the author envisioned, and I'll tell you that that is fantastic as well if you're a reader, but the HBO series is, with little exception, that in the flesh. Uncanny, so far.<br /><br />So now, I await standard shipping and the DVDs from Amazon. I'm anxious to see the extras to broaden what I know about the show and share the truly engrossing experience that has been coming to know this series, and now the books, with my friends and boss. Martin has gained a new reader, and HBO has made a little cash from me, and, being an impatient man, might just get a subscriber so I can see season three 'live'. And then Amazon for the DVDs of THAT season, and so on. Comcast wins, Martin wins, HBO wins, Amazon wins, but I am the ultimate victor for the sheer entertainment and experience I can witness over and over, and share with my friends.<br /><br />Come on delivery date!!the truly engrossing experience that has been coming to know this series, and now the books, with my friends and boss.

B00AHSIQWE|3.0|While better than most Hollywood blockbusters these days, Batman is sadly falling into the same traps that have turned most modern movies into utter crap.<br /><br />The bad guys have become one-dimensional characters with their only purpose to push the Batman towards the directors story-line.  For example, Bane declares that he's going to blow up Gotham, but he's going to wait for five months to do it.  Yet his only motivation in life is to blow up Gotham.  So what's the point?  Simply to allow Batman enough time to heal from injuries to get back into the story.  It was ridiculous enough that I nearly expected Batman to begin training in a classic 80's montage.<br /><br />The special effects are also the same bland CGI garbage that has pushed Hollywood action towards irrelevance in the US.  If the sequel keeps going along the same path, you can expect the batmobile and batcopter to turn into Transformers and save the day.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Ordered this for my young grandsons to watch when a G'mas, but we watched it 2 days in a row.  Love it and so do they.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|I always look forward to releases from Trent Reznor and his wife, as they take music to new places as well as Trent did with Nine Inch Nails. This cd certainly did not disappoint! Sometimes ethereal, sometimes otherworldly, sometimes pounding, always appealing.
B00BTZNEN0|4.0|I love OneRepublic, so when their new album came out I bought it straight away!  Native has a great mix of slow and quick paced songs.  The singles Feel Again and If I Lose Myself I bought when they came out, so they are already two of my favorites.  As usual, the overall message of the album is positive, especially pinpointed in the songs I Lived: &#34;With every broken bone, I swear I lived,&#34; and in Something I Need: &#34;If we only live once, I want to live with you.&#34;<br />To sum up, great album!  I would recommend it to other lovers of the Indi genre and, since it has some more pop-ish songs, I might recommend it to a mainstreamer as well.<br />Can't wait for more by OneRepublic.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|This film was very well done. I found the plot sticking with me. I could not get the miscarriage of justice out of my mind. It drove me to do some real research on Mary Sarrat.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Perhaps because I am a Christian with the same values as depicted in the film, perhaps because I recognize the truths the film shows, perhaps because I am an avid movie buff. For whatever \\"because,\\" for whatever reason, I find \\"Courageous\\" one of the most perfect films ever created. Every character rings true, every piece of dialogue, every scene, every setting, every part and parcel of action and plot ring true. \\"Courageous\\" is an awesome and amazing film filled with great emotional, moral, ethical moments buttressed by clips of exciting action scenes. It's a film worthy of viewing multiple times.<br /><br />\\"Courageous\\" depicts the daily lives of four police officers and their Latino friend, Javier. The main character is played by the co-writer/director/producer, Adam Kendrick, whose finger is on the very mainline pulse of the America that once existed--a moral America. The film promotes many positive things, foremost being a good father, a father as set forth in the Bible. In fact, the ultimate premise for this promotion lies in statistics: Families without fathers tend toward serious delinquency problems. There's a void in the child's heart that needs to be filled, if not with a good father image, then with gang leaders. Even fathers who are a part of the family direct their children away from them if they are present but unavailable.<br /><br />The event that precipitates this resolution to be a true father is the death of the main character's precious daughter. Be prepared to be deeply moved by this well-written section. Some scripts try to jerk the viewer emotionally, but not this one. Everything is so evenly played and handled. No maudlin moments, no flaunting of emotional excess.<br /><br />Each of the male characters was (carefully, not blatantly) created to represent a specific type of man/father. Adam's character is the founder and spokesperson for the group that resolves to be biblically-based fathers. Nathan is the fine, upstanding black officer, proud of his accomplishments but who came out of a fatherless home and severely felt the loss. One character is the single man (young, white) who has fathered a child and not taken responsibility for her. The last is the one who yields to temptation and breaks the bond that hold the men together. The fifth is a Latino, a devout Catholic, a family man who is having terrible problems with keeping a job, not through his own fault. How he becomes a member of this little group is part of a hilarious, yet touching scene.<br /><br />Family complications and eventual growth also make this film inspirational. So, bottom line: inspiration of several kinds, integrity, loyalty, honest and decent work, friendship, and commitment to true religious values all contribute to making this a film worthy of purchase to make multiple viewings possible. I absolutely loved \\"Courageous\\" and all it stands for.of his accomplishments but who came out of a fatherless home and severely felt the loss.

So, bottom line: inspiration of several kinds, integrity, loyalty, honest and decent work, friendship, and commitment to true religious values all contribute to making this a film worthy of purchase to make multiple viewings possible. I absolutely loved \\"Courageous\\" and all it stands for.
B005UBNKWO|3.0|I have had this awhile and  so far no problems thought amd has made  better cpus  it's  not expensive and so far  i have had  no issues  my game run smooth and i don't lag  as much as most with games like  swtor or sl
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was fantastically written and so touching. I'm in my 30s and loved this novel - it is definitely not just for teens/YA. Be prepared with tissues - I cried my little eyes out through the last 30 pages.
B005BX3NAA|3.0|Good cd. Should have stopped at the 10 popular songs. The last three are crap. Some that should be on here aren't.<br />Satisfied overall
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Again, all three of the Clifton Chronicles are great reading, the ending of each Chronicle leading into the next part of the saga.<br />Currently, the ending of Chronicle 3 indicates there's more to follow, albeit we've come to the end of the Clifton Chronicles.<br />Hopefully, there is more as I don't want the story to end.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The books drags along, following the narrative of two people until they reach the same timeline.  The last 20% of the book rushes through the conclusion , and a weak ending.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|The Clifton Chronicles 1, 2 & 3 are superb reading.  The story-line in 3 indicates that there has to be a follow-up.... notwithstanding there are only 3 Chronicles.  If there isn't, I shall be VERY  disappointed.<br />Otherwise, I would thoroughly recommend the Trilogy.
1400069742|5.0|This is a superbly researched and written description of the acrimonious battle between isolationists and interventionists leading up to America's entry into World War II. From politicians to military personnel and private citizens in all walks of life it was a battle of deep principles and convictions influenced by a wide variety of experiences: consequences from World War I, pacifist convictions, horror over Nazi treatment of Jews, and cruel military aggression against Germany's European neighbors.<br /><br />The battle for public opinion was waged by groups from America First to the Century Group over contentious political decisions such as Lend-Lease and universal conscription. I was very surprised to learn that America First's origins were among liberal Yale students. But it was also a public and private battle for public opinion between American heroes Charles Lindbergh and Franklin Roosevelt. Olson's portrayal of 1940 Republican presidential nominee, Wendell Wilkie, as an interventionist supporter of administration policy was also a surprise to me, having associated isolationism with Republican stalwarts such as Senator Taft. She is convincing that this was an issue of principle far more than an issue of political partyisanship.<br /><br />For those of us too young to remember, this book is history eloquently written. It took the horrific Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor to unite the partisan warriors and reveal Americans' willingness to respond to crisis and leadership -- a strangely comforting sense of hope that we can eventually overcome current partisan controversies.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is packed with information and encouragement.  Dr. Davis backs up his claims with scientific evidence.  Going wheat free sounds radical.  Modern, modified wheat is so prevalent in the American fast-food and supermarket diet. Dr. Davis offers sound evidence for being wheat-free and makes lots of suggestions on how to do it.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|I love all the Dr. Panda games and this one is no exception. My 2.75 year old daughter loves it. You can't beat it for the price. Only one draw back is I wish there were more customers but for $1.99 I guess how much data shouls I expect. IMO it is worth it.
B000I9W08I|5.0|THIS IS THE 100TH TIME I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE. AND IT IS GREAT! AND i WOULD SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
B00BVVA138|5.0|Very glad to see Jesse back as the vocalist in this band. I really like the production value on this cd, not quite as slick as the last few ones they've put out. Great guitar tone, bass and drums are locked, vocals are awesome. Would suggest this disc to anyone that bought the first 2 cd's they put out, anyone that listens to ATR, or any of the other scream/sing/scream metal out there.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|How did they do that?  Turn a wimp into an Atlas?  And back during World War II no less!  And what a villain!  I love campy movies and this was fun....
B0036EBARO|5.0|I love Goldfrapp, that's why I give this album 5 stars!! What can I say, it's that simple.  It's such positive music and makes me feel happy and energized.  Allison's voice is beautiful and it pairs well with the music.  If you like electronic music, but not overly crazy electronic music, you might like Goldfrapp.  Black Cherry and Supernature are my favorites followed by Head First.  The group definitely deserves more recognition than they get... so give it a try.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|an improbable hero for an improbable adventure.  the story is campy, but fun to watch.  he ought to be one of the Avengers!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I like the Twilight books and the movie series.  If you don't, then why would you buy or rent this?  If you want to see what you think, then I definitely recommend starting with the first book or movie and not this one, which is the second to last.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Perhaps the BEST ALBUM I have EVER come across!!  There is not even ONE song that I couldn't listen to over and over! Their (very relatable!) folksy music (complete with acoustic guitar & banjo) literally draws the emotions from you! If you like Mumford & Sons at ALL, you should LOVE this album, heart & soul! :)
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The movie was intriguing and intense, good directing and acting throughout the movie.I would like to read the book for historical purposes.  Thanks again to the Canadian government.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|We enjoyed the movie, but the music overpowered the singing and it was hard to hear. Visually beautiful to watch.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The cast and writers for Downtown Abbey are superb.  Shows on PBS are usually quality and this show was no exception.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This movie is still a classic. I loved it when I was in high school, and now my daughter watched it and felt the same.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like that there is no time limit, my 5 year old manages to get to some of the higher levels but it's challenging for him. Age rating 6
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great book if you want a quick easy read with twists and turns. Having kids the same age as Jacob in the book, I liked the edgy feeling of not knowing what was going to happen.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Getting use to these Android apps is going to take some time to get used to. Which is why I gave it 3 stars. Once I get used to the layout of Android apps I'm sure all will be fine.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is fabulous I expected it to be wort 99 cents but it's free I totally recommend this game
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Helps those that have not served better understand some of the true sacrifices that members of the military do each and every day for the rest of us.<br /><br />I did not want to put it down until I completed it.  Truly worth the time and money.
0061146307|4.0|This is the start f the Badelaurie adventures, really great book, to set you to know the villanious Count Olaf, the smart engineer Violet, the book lover Klaus, the brave Sunny.<br />Poor Baudelair kids, tradegy follows tragedy. and even the &#34;happy ending&#34; is just the pause before the next tragedy.<br />Written in a really interesting style, its a great book.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I don't know if it was the subject matter, but I found it much harder to be totally immersed in this book - unlike Pillars of the Earth which I could hardly put down. In the end I enjoyed it and will probably go on to read the second book in the series.
B008MM9630|4.0|I like the game but I don't seem to get the special prizes so I can't. complete the quests. not sure if this is a glitch.
B004U8VX2M|3.0|I am afraid I had never watched this series when it came out.  Watching it now after viewing Downton Abbey was disappointing from the acting, to the darkness of the production and hokey scenery. Won't be finishing the series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|this amazing book trilogy has a little bit of everything for everyone out there. Coundn't put book down at all. But I do suggest more matured people read thes books. Have fun!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|well written, engaging, and keeps me wanting more. Masterpiece Theater at its best! Can't wait to see the next season!
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Sheryl Sandburg is obviously getting a lot of press over her book and much of what is written inside can be found in her TED talks or in her speech to the students at Barnard, or in her other interviews.  So purchasing the book isn't necessarily required to understand her message, and that's actually a good thing because it demonstrates message restraint and allows for people to hear what she is trying to say.  Still, with this book she is restarting, or jumping into, a national conversation that is worth having.  So from that end, it's worth buying to read it and consider the arguments she is making inside.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The Shield is the most exciting Police show ever. You will see some of the best acting by many of the cast along with scripts that make this the best police show ever produced.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|this is such an inspiring film. it is worth it to rent, own and show to all of your friends and neighbors. Rodriguez can teach everyone what humility really looks like.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|After I figured out the stragedy of the game it was addictive.  You keep trying to better your highest score.
B009AMANH4|2.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie. I will not say too much about the film--it was fantastic in many ways, and I enjoyed seeing historical sites I have visited in person. However, I was VERY disappointed in the lack of bonus features on the two-disc Blu-ray/DVD set. Just two little featurettes? And NO commentary? I wish I had just rented this instead of purchasing it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I don't even know where to start. So i'll just jump right in.<br /><br />The main reason I chose to read this book was because of the raving 5 star reviews. I had absolutely no idea what it was going to be about. I really liked the way it was written. From such a real character, who was so brutally honest in everything he said. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone who hasn't started reading it yet, but I will say, this book is a must read.<br /><br />Going to watch the movie now (which I've heard is EXCELLENT).
0679409920|5.0|The book I received didn't look like the new cover but I liked that. Everyone else in my class had a new paperback copy.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Can't get it to work at all. Unable to guess another's drawing and they are unable to guess mine. Goes straight to a new clue and drawing. I have deleted it from my tablet and feel that I wasted the 2.99 to purchase this game
B000244FDW|5.0|Again I like this version of Pride and Prejudice.  The acting was great and the characters were well depicted.  I enjoyed every bit of the film.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|Loved this series. I didn't think that I would be able to watch it in America since it is a British show, but I loved it!!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I really enjoy their music and the use of the piano in producing so many sounds.  I appreciate the gifts of muscianship of these men.
0062082353|5.0|Another HERO in our military! Great book to read and hard to put down. Just a man doing his job and protecting other service men and women!
B004V4H55Y|5.0|I enjoy the stories very much and really like having the on the kindle. The delivery of the book is so amazing in that it is so quick.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This is the only diet I have ever found that I can lose weight by and keep it off permanently!
B00364K6YW|5.0|So far my favorite version of Pride and Prejudice!!! The others are good too; I just like this one best.
B0064QNS62|4.0|not a bad game a little hard but works good on the kindle fire HD. graphics are a little out dated but i think that's what the game devs w wanted.Worth downloading as the faotd.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|Honestly this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The story is so well portrayed by Angelina jolie that you feel an emotional connection and think about things deeper and more intricately. I fully recommend this video and am very satisfied with my purchase.
076781214X|3.0|This movie is awesome and the place shipped the movie in a few days which was great thanks guys !
B002NXOQF2|5.0|one of the best novels ever written, hands down, no question about it.  I have read this book at least 10 tomes and I look forward to reading it again.
B008AZ6RTK|3.0|This movie is awesome and the place shipped the movie in a few days which was great thanks guys !
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is one of the best series I've ever read .I am so happy that I have a great series to occupy me for a while;)
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love water noises such as water fall, waves, etc. They have alot of good water noises that help you relax.
B000G03RJA|5.0|I believe this collection has all her best music on it. In fact I am going to order another and send it to a friend.  mike
B000FA675C|5.0|My sister first bought this book for me and she told me to read it, I am glad I did because it was a great book. A must read by everybody. The book is 100x better than the movie..G
B005BOHYW2|3.0|Does not have enough depth; the foundation was great but it could have developed into sumthing more interesting that the average &#34;love story&#34;
B002SRQ214|5.0|Bought two of these to build two new machines. Both installed easily and run smoothly.<br /><br />Pro's: Easy install, Runs cooler than an older 3Ghz CPU I had before.<br /><br />Con's: Heat sink fan runs quiet most of the time but can get a bit loud with higher temps.
B00005AAFS|5.0|came in great shape, took forever to get here though . . . . . . .. . .  .
B003O86FMW|5.0|this book is awesome and i'm ecstatic for the movie this year, it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, and was unable to put the book down! i usually take my time w/ books, but the entire series was done in less than 2 wks. (between full time job/school)
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Great story.... Continues as brilliant as the first two seasons. But some English subtitles would have been nice for non-native speakers...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|my favorite of the 3! and not because it is the last book, everything ties together in this book, and it is an edge of your seat action book!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Great story.... Continues as brilliant as the first two seasons. But some English subtitles would have been nice for non-native speakers...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i wish the movie was rated r they may have showed this books true potential! loved the action it brought, suspense, and the vivid details!
B005IQZB14|5.0|A real page turner. She is a great writer. She has an uncanny talent for transferring complex feelings to paper. This is a must read book!
B0087EACJK|4.0|The game I played years ago did not require you to slide panels around. This is a bit more difficult because of that. If you are shooting for quick times it seems the panels don't slide easily enough. Still a good game, you just have to get used to it.
B0050IY61G|5.0|Reading this book was like reading my biography much of the time.  It answered many of the questions I had about why I did not see things the same way others did and why it was so hard for me to understand the behaviour of others and social situations and the high level of anxiety I always had.  This book is written for adults as well as for children.  If you have Asperger's this is a must read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I give it 5 stars because this is a fun game it is fast and it keeps you on you toes. My grand kids love it to!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so awesome I really love this app I will never stop playing I will play this untill I die
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game a lot, you can sit there for a long time seeing this kid run. My grand kids are pretty good at this game.
B001UAX56A|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this album. Love it so much that I purchased this and then realized I already had the physical CD in my possession- that's okay though. My favorite Lauryn Hill selections.
B005K17RU0|3.0|It's okay to get your weather ,it's better than most local weather.Pulls up most cities, and the graphics are good
B00AHXIC50|3.0|Really am fairly new to Bruno and I purchased this as it was on an MP3 sale, its okay. He has a unique sound so maybe I will need to get used to it before I really just enjoy listening to it. I like it though and for the price it was a good way to get to know his music.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is great and challenging.<br />I didn't like the fact that when you run, you can slide off the road.
B001458MI2|4.0|I cant really call myself a Christina Aguilera fan I am familiar with her music only on a surface level- if its really popular kind of thing. I purchased this album though and its really good. I enjoy listening to all of the songs here. Maybe I'm a fan now:-)
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Listening to one of the CD's now! My 9-year-old son has become an MJ fan because of these CDs. The DVD was also great to watch.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Got this for my kids to play, though its a little more difficult than the original and seasons they seem to like it. My 6 year old is determined to have 3 stars every time so he definitely likes the challenges.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I really love this show, no thinking required, just plain enjoyment.  The characters are fun, watching them commit so many crimes and knowing they are lawyers, what a hoot.
B008JOLG7U|3.0|First let me say I have never considered myself a Jennifer Lopez fan and I purchased this because it was on sale for $2.99, and its okay. I was familiar with 2 of the songs and I really like those 2 songs. The other songs are okay to listen to as well. Not bad for $2.99, but I would not have paid more than that.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Now I will have to see in 3D! Stunning visuals, brought the book to life. Well told story. ha ha
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Downloaded this app after it was featured on Dr. Oz show for getting better sleep. I have a difficult time winding down at night and this is really great for that. It has quite a few listening choices and the timer is great because I can set and relax.
B0067R0APK|3.0|Just replaced the free app with platinum.  Although widgets are mentioned in description, I can't find them/it.  Also maps don't work.  Only a blank screen except for the map legend.  Satellite view also not working.  Only good point is no ads. Sent them email and may update this review if they give a satisfactory answer.
B00A2GQT5C|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this compilation!!. I searched through others, but thought this one to be a better representation of her work I was looking for. Some others have a lot of the remix kind of stuff I wasn't interested in that- I just wanted to hear Whitney sing. It really is a BEST of Whitney.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love it . It is loads of fun and i cant wait for the new levels. Trying to 3 star every game,
B0096DZKZC|4.0|My kids 3, 4 and 6 love this app. I never would have purchased it for $6.99 but my daughter had my Kindle and made the purchase herself. They really love it though and play it often so it wasn't money wasted.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|So many books I never got a chance to read in my youth are now available for free on e-books.  RLS was one of the great ones.  He knows how to make you feel like you are there in the action.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Mr. Howey's skill as a writer combines with his story-telling gifts to deliver a terrific tale of a terrifying future!  You will smell the grease from the 'down deep', feel the grit hit your helmet and shiver in the chilly waters at the bottom of the silo as you explore Mr. Howey's fascinating and fantastic world.  A 'must' for science fiction fans; an 'ought to' for anyone who values good writing, strong characters and a great tale!
B003PIS5XI|5.0|This movie was filmed right before the whole &#34;computer&#34; effects era took place. Its cool to see how much movies have progressed.  I think this movie allows us to appreciate what we have now and also respect the classics that we grew up with!!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Fun but a little slow<br />Had fun building park, but would be nice to move it faster without having to spend money.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Excellent murder mystery with a wonderful, all-star cast.  Tommy Lee Jones does not disappoint, and the rest of the cast is simply wonderful!  Definitely worth a watch :)
B007HC3LHS|5.0|The beginning of the book was confusing and seemed disjointed, but if you'll stay with it, you will be rewarded with a compelling story, well-written and a definite page-turner in the last several chapters. I don't want to give anything away, but when I finished, I immediately flipped back to the beginning so I could appreciate the significance of the chapters that had initially confused me.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A great series of books which I've now read more than a few times. I find the first two books to be much stronger in character development than the third which unfortunately can lead to a somewhat less than fulfilling ending for some readers. Overall I loved the books and Collins writing style which kept me thoroughly entertained and engaged.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game. I love the challege. I loving the inventor. Please give him or her my number. LOL. Just love it.
0671027344|5.0|This is a great book. I read it few years ago and I just watched the movie. If you liked the movie then you will love this book. It has so much more than the movie. You should be able to read this in a matter of hours. Buy it if you like a good read.
B00A7CI82I|2.0|I am a big fan of the Bourne Trilogy, and I knew that this film did not star Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. But I thought that I would check it out anyway, Well I was deeply disappointed to say the least. The actor who played the lead character did a good job, and there a couple of exciting scenes, But it just was not the same, furthermore I personally did not like the ending.  I feel that if they are going to do any more films in the Bourne tradition, they should star Matt Damon. This is just my personal opinion, and I may be biased, So I leave it up to you to decide whether or not to watch it!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Every since Susan appeared on America tv I have been a fan. This album reflects her great talent over and over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm hooked on this game, I cant even stop playing it for ten minutes. love it so so so much!
0446572993|5.0|A book by this author is an invitation to participate in a great reading experience. I always look forward to his new books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|.  My 8 year old daughter loves it. Good graphics  I like it too. Lots of fun activities and th horses are beautiful.
B003ZHR6SY|5.0|It has both English and Spanish language support. Great movie for less price. My son loves it. I would recommend this to a friend.<br />Thanks
B00742H26M|4.0|Different from the book but still good. Fanny Price is actually more interesting here than in the original Austen novel.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|it is okay - after a few plays you really need to buy the full version - you will keep getting the same puzzles over & over.  It is very slow to load.  I think it is okay but not great.
B002RV01QI|5.0|Enya is becoming my new favorite, simply because her music just relaxes me after having long day, and listen to this album while i am driving, makes time fly!!!
B007N3206E|5.0|A well acted film. The film was not about being entertained ,because i found it to be very heavy going,never the less a good story.Of the early days of Las Vegas.  dont let your children watch it. The Blu-RaY copy is very good.<br /><br />Ken Barrettt<br /><br />Mooroolbark<br /><br />Vic Australia
B0045HCIZY|3.0|It's pretty much a mid 1990s chick flick but it's interesting to see Ethan Hawk's early career. This movie was deffenitly made for women.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|now i can access the Bible anytime anywhere and  perfect with audio option.Thanks.I  highly recommend this app to allwho want to read the Bible and understand The Word.
B005IQZB14|5.0|If you've ever done any backpacking, this is a fun read that will remind you of your own experiences out in nature. The story about her own life and relationships that she weaves in throughout the book is interesting and pretty well written. Worth your time.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book!  I loved the characters and the setting!  I would reccommend it to all my friends for sure
B005K17RU0|2.0|the way the weather info was shown previous to it being changed was far better than the current one.  nuff said.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ok so the graphics are fantastic and its the cheapest way to own your own horse. But its also fairly time consuming.  It takes awhile to level up and a lot of work but as a horse owner  I can honestly say real horses take much more time and care than these ones!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Awesome game. Love everything about it. Great planes. Love that you can get new ones at different levels too. I already told 2 people to get this game and they have.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok those I  the best I have pocket edition lite, pocket edition full the pc version and the Xbox version awesome and my friend sean can use my iPod messianic have it on there too also on my kindle and we join worlds. I can't get enough of th  freaking awesome minecraft.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|even better than Cold Play, a glimpse into the developed cadence and the honesty of his lyric as influenced by his life experiences and artists of his day.
B009S33I68|2.0|I'm able to finish nearly ALL the books I start including most I don't like.  But not this one.<br />It has all the panache of a high school history book.  The text plods along.  Tedious describing all the titles and locations and times and dates.<br /><br />McCullough and others write the STORY of history in an engaging fashion.  NOT this book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a very good series, the characters are very well done.  The clothes are very beautiful, and cars from that period are well done.  The only problem is slow load times.
B000X6JESA|5.0|This is the cutest little sheep that will perfectly compliment the book, &#34;Where is the Green Sheep?&#34;!  I plan to use it in a story program for preschoolers!  It is tiny and oh, so cuddly!  Little ones will love holding it and its lime green color will surely generate much conversation!  The sheep's sweet smile will beckon both the young and the young at heart to share in it's story!  Buy it!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|you really should read really good but sad. Kind of scary but you should l read. Be prepared to feel sad.
0374533571|5.0|I bought the audiobook of Silver Linings Playbook to be ornery - my daughter told me to watch the movie.  After seeing and disliking the trailer, I happened upon book reviews and decided the book seemed a bit more interesting than the movie.  So I plunged right in, expecting to hold onto every drop of cynicism I had come in with... and caught myself by surprise, enjoying the book and the exceptionally skillful narration.<br /><br />Here are excerpts from my 5-star Audible review - I find their Q&A format helpful in putting my thoughts together:<br /><br />***Where does The Silver Linings Playbook rank among all the audiobooks you've listened to so far?<br /><br />That's tough because there have been so many. I can't say it's my favourite, just as it's so hard to say a print book is your favourite. But it's very, VERY well done.<br /><br />*** What was one of the most memorable moments of The Silver Linings Playbook?<br /><br />I think the sessions with the protagonist's therapist were cumulatively the most memorable moments - the narrator perfectly captures every nuance of those often painfully difficult exchanges, from the character's humming whenever Kenny G is mentioned to their shared love of Eagles football. I could picture the therapist's office and overhear their dialogue perfectly; what an awesome fly-on-the-wall vantage point!<br /><br />*** Which character - as performed by Ray Porter - was your favorite?<br /><br />I'd have to say the protagonist, Pat Peoples. Porter does such a great job capturing specific quirks of his voice - like the awed way he says \\"Stomach Master 6000\\" every single time.<br /><br />*** Was this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?<br /><br />Indeed - listening to the audiobook made me want to devour this book so completely - and prolong the experience - that I also got the ebook version, which I'm enjoying on my tablet now.<br /><br />*** Any additional comments?<br /><br />The only downside I've found is that since this is the post-movie release version, there are pictures of the characters on the \\"cover\\" and on the Audible/Amazon site.

B0091REZMW|5.0|great game love it. cant stop playing. one of the best. you need to try it for yourself. great one.
B00005T30L|3.0|This movie is strange.  If you like strange, you might like this movie.  Then again, maybe not.  To be honest, the beginning of this review sounds like this movie...a movie about not being sure of where you want to go, what you want to do, and who you want to be.<br /><br />Enid and Rebecca are best buds who have just graduated from high school.  Rebecca shoots right out and gets a job, goes apartment hunting, and is eager to get out into the world and be like everyone else.  Enid isn't sure.  In fact, Enid isn't sure of much of anything, even what color hair she wants or if she wants to be an artist or what she thinks of her dad's new girlfriend.<br /><br />Along the way, Enid decides to play a game on a single older man named Seymour...and ends up becoming deeply involved in his life.  I wonder if its because she sees something of herself in him--strange, doesn't quite fit in, might never comes to much of anything.<br /><br />This story ambles along and is both sad and funny in parts.  Steve Buscemi is brilliant, as ever, and what got me to buy this movie in the first place.  That, plus the wonderful Bollywood inspired opening scene that Enid is dancing to in the beginning.  The DVD includes a full copy of it and it makes me want to find a copy of the original movie it is from.<br /><br />Not a happy movie, but a strange one and one that will ressonate with you if you were ever in Enid's shoes.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Beautiful, just beautiful.  It made me cry.  Most of his books do...but all happy ans sad tears. A must read.
030758836X|1.0|It's not that it was poorly written, it's just that I didn't like it.....at all. We selected this book for a book club read based on the reviews and what sounded like an interesting premise. I won't give anything away, but I found the ending annoying. I was relieved once it was over & I could leave these awful characters behind. Dropping this in my library donate box, resisting the urge to put a post-it warning on the inside for the next reader.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. I absolutely love it. All my friends play it and it's definitely great for everyone.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Very addicted to the game. Sometimes I can't put it down for hours. They need to make more games like this.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|By in large the entire Fringe series is worth a watch.  One of those what next kind of shows that keeps you wondering where it is headed next.  Worth a watch and is well done with good acting.
B008MM9630|5.0|Im so addicted in this game.i downloaded it in my three tablet.Please minimize of using gems in completing a quest.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|There isn't much you can say about Bond Movies other than they are never boring or lacking action.  A few unexpexted things take place in this offering.  As is usualy the case it is a good watch just to see what they will come up with next,
B001GSTOAM|5.0|30% education. 70% inspiration. I won't retread ground already covered by other reviewers. Simply put this text has enlightened me of new techniques, reminded me of things I've always known, but most importantly inspired me to do better.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Nothing too unusual or differentiating about this si-fi show.  Not bad but I have seen better.  might appeal to the younger crowd but didn't wow mw very much.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Look forward to his new book every year..  Can't wait for the first big movie coming in a year or so
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Listen to this over and over in my car and find the ballads really soothing.  Almost as good as Broadway cast.
B0019N95IK|4.0|An amazing packaging. I didn't watch Enterprise when it was first shown on tv and it's a delightful surprise for me. The most interesting part is to see what was the Federation before the first Star Trek, the dream and fear of the people in board.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I got a little tired of all the hidden object games.<br /><br />Good storyline and graphics. Looking forward to the continuation.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book was very good I can't wait to buy the reached the last book.  It is worth the price because this book isn't my regular 3.99$ it's like 10.99$. But it's that good.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The series as gone away from &#34;just surviving&#34; to a new and real conflict against the Governor. I hope that the series continues to evolve.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|-A Higher Call was worth all the research the author put in to it  The facts are very interesting themselves  but learning what makes a country's fighting machine tick is fascinating.. Getting to know the mind set of the main character, the German pilot, was done extremely well. He was so real, so truthful about his horriror of what he was forced to do as a fighter pilot, and so strong in what he did as a human being that you had to root for him.  Knowing the story was true and the ending was successful made all the misery we had to read about almost worthwhile.  I hated to see it end.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked this book BUT I had a hard time with the believability at the end. Great story, great characters slightly disappointed ending, but that's just me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite kindle game! Even got my family to compete against. Excellant job Kiloo!! Keep up the amazing work!!
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Huey Lewis and the News is one of those great groups that just keep belting out hit after hit. The fun thing about this collection is that there are so many hits on it and very few songs I'd never heard before, and I am quickly becoming a fan of the new songs too. Makes my commute fun listening to these guys.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|This last opus of the Cemetery or Forgotten Books is absolutely fantastic and I've been reading all works from Carlos Luis Zafon, and I still enjoy it.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I DID NOTGET THIS DOWNLOADED. I DELETED THE. RIONANDNWOULD LOVEN.TO. JAV. Ha e9<br /><br />Lll<br /><br />LOLL.  IT. ACK<br />I did not recked e it.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is adorable, has you laughing then crying. Even got my boyfriend to admit liking this movie. Great story line, you won't want to miss any part of this movie. It's that good
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love this album very much. It was probably her best album ever made. But at the same time i love the rest of her CDs and songs.
B003U51D58|5.0|If you haven't...watch all seasons...it gets a little slow around season 4...but season 6 wraps it all up! Love LOST!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am still reading Hunger Games but it is certain that I will get to this one sooner or later.  Very interesting story line.
B00AJLHTU4|5.0|A must for every DT fan and now available again! If you are into DT, the perfect way to open the door to their sound!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I haven't finished it yet but I am into the story enough that I will finish it.<br />Friends have recommened it along the Catching Fire
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Everyone in my book club loved it, including me. It Made for a great discussion.I will probably read it again.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't care that the first part of the book is a set-up for the rest of it. It was boring. It was supposed to be a hook, and a hook should grab you and keep you hanging and wanting more.  If I had not been in a book club, I never would have continued reading it.  Also the language was coarse and unnecessary.  A good writer can find other words to convey the story.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Each season gets better and better. I can't stop watching. Unlike anything I have ever seen, it keeps me guessing
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|As a woman in business, I recognized myself in so many situations that Sandberg describes! What I liked in particular is that she gives practical tips on how to approach situations like salary negotiations, self-doubt issues, raising children while having a demanding job, etc. I highly recommend this book.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|MY GRANDSON LOVES THIS ONE. IT IS VERY FAST AND GRAPHICS ARE GREAT. MY GRANDAUGHTER LIKES IT TOO BUT HAS A HARD TIME CONTROLLING IT. IT WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS A SETTING FOR SPEED.
B00160FBWK|5.0|My son bought it for a gift and they liked it. The movie was packaged well and we received it lightning quick without any problems...
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Good to get the conversation started. I don't agree with Ms Sandberg's position on mentoring. Also I think her comments on getting a strong partner is somewhat of a put down to independent women.
B00632HWOG|2.0|The Classic was so easy to use but this new change is awful.  I have two e-mails that I could get with the Classic.  I can't get it anymore just the Yahoo one.  I wish they would go back to the old system.
0553386697|5.0|The use of neurology and behavioral psychology in this book makes the information deeply compelling and convincing, and the authors present it in accessible, easy-to-apply ways.  This book will change the way I parent.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|The more I listen to this album, the more I like it.  It's not as up tempo as I normally like my music but the production does what it really should do which is highlight the lyrics.  The subject matter is diverse and intelligent, its just such a great change from most of what you hear out there.  Listen to it, think about it, listen again.  Great album
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A friend recommended this book but I have to say I was apprehensive.  Well he was right!  Easy read and spot on. You immediately see yourself and those around you in this book. A good tool for dealing with and understanding the diversity in people's actions.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great story line<br />Great characters<br />Unique TV drama<br />Able to maintain suspense and thriller quotient throughout seasons and within individual episodes
B0051ANPZQ|2.0|Loved it best book good HI HI HI HI HI HI HI huh HI HI HI HI HI HI hi
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci once again hits a home run as John Puller fights the evils of human trafficing (a very real issue).  The many twists and turns and questions of who can be trusted make for another can't-put-it-down thriller.
B005OK721G|5.0|I love this picture for Zoe's performance. Her athletic ability is brought out fully in this movie. The young version of her character in amazing, also, at her abilities in the chase scenes.
0152023984|5.0|this book is fantastic. i got it for my 5-year-old and we read it together. i'll admit it - i cried at the end. this book is a classic for many reasons. the humor, the insight, and the love. it puts a new perspective on things. i love it and can't wait until she's ready to read it again, although i may just read it on my own.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Not enough development of the aliens for my satisfaction. Why were they here and why so war like? I enjoyed the movie.
B002VECLVO|5.0|I saw this movie and enjoyed it so much, it is so sophisticated, love the cast, a really fine movie. I just had to buy it. There was so much in this movie, I was in love with the sets, the house, the clothes, the makeup, everything. Mid century fantastic.
B008Q0D9DG|4.0|I watch this movie every Spring to watch the &#34;Wild Thing&#34; arrival on the mound in the last portion of the movie.
034580404X|1.0|I didn't even finish the third book, it was like pulling teeth after the first book and couldn't get rid of them soon enough.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Another Matt Damon scary look at the possibilities of the real nature of our world. I enjoyed this movie very much.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|My theory is that Peter Jackson was born to make Tolkien movies. I loved the entire LoTR trilogy and Hobbit has completely lived up to my (astronomically high) expectations. I love how the appendices have been integrated into the film and how Jackson has balanced the lighter, more humorous aspects of \\"Hobbit as children's story\\" with \\"epic battle for Erebor & precursor to the War of the Rings\\" elements I think we all expect.<br /><br />I have no issues with Jackson's 3-D or HD filming but I will admit that sometimes during very 3-D heavy scenes, it's difficult to track the characters due to the surrounding action.<br /><br />P.S. Radagast & the rabbits rock! I think Tolkien would have loved that. And so would the children he wrote the story for.
B008VVT51U|5.0|A very unusual story of British retirees moving to India to live out their lives in a dilapidated hotel. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting and the characters. Very British buy very comedic too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|How have I missed this for four years? Now I need to play catch-up.  Finished season one,  Seasons 2, 3, and 4 to go!
B00866JL96|5.0|The main characters tolerance from the Deputy Sheriff is insufferable to me but high praise for how he handled it. Very enjoyable movie.
B005LAII4E|3.0|My son and I were so disappointed last summer when G I Joe retaliation was delayed. Unlike many critics, we both thoroughly enjoyed the first offering; however, you should know that we also loved the movie \\"Battleship\\"- so maybe we're nuts! (Not joking- we seriously thought it was great!) At any rate, we wanted to love this movie... \\"wanted\\" being the key word. It has its moments,nice special effects, as well as decent acting- but it's missing something... as the French would say, that \\"I don't know what\\". (OK, I stole that one from Austin Powers!) So, what's missing...that je ne sais qua... maybe there isn't a compelling storyline or the lack of true heart.  Judge for yourselves. You may ask- will I buy the blu-ray?  OF COURSE I WILL!!
B002ZG999U|1.0|I could not watch the whole movie. Not worth the effort of buying it. I won't ever watch it again.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Awesome book!  A must read!!  The book was just a great story through out!  What a great book!!! 5 stars!!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Extremely funny. The British characters are very well played. Paul is so unusual that you have to laugh at just about every line he speaks.
B0093ST02E|5.0|Even though I kind of expected where this movie was headed, it headed there in a great way. I loved the way the actors played their characters and how they related to each other. One of Sarah Silverman's last lines in this movie is absolutely true and wonderful, but I shall let you watch it to figure out what that line was!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I am 99% satisfied with this purchase.  It arrived on time. The only problem was that the case hinge was broken.
0792156684|5.0|grand daughter wanted to see the original and this was great. She loved it. She hates love stories and loved this one
B000GWE44U|5.0|Creepy, funny and fantastic scenery - what more could you ask for.  Jack Nicholson is perfect in this role.  The blu ray really made the opening scenes amazing.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|This movie is so well done from every perspective. For me, this movie was the best movie for 2012.<br /><br />This movie has all the elements to really pull at the heart:  action, suspense, drama, and joy.<br /><br />Don't miss this impossible story that could never happen again for a 100 years!
B00BQPEIT2|2.0|Out of the three Temple Run games we have, this is by far the worst when it comes to user friendly for kids.  My son only plays on the Kindle Fire HD every once in awhile so the games and apps that I purchase need to work and be entertaining and Temple Run Oz is not in my opinion.  It is also frustrating that the game tries to sell you things frequently!  I removed it from my tablet.
B004IAH7UE|5.0|I was thrilled to find this movie in your library! It is a hard movie to find as far as streaming goes. I would love to see an option in your Prime video service to &#34;save&#34; or &#34;que&#34; movies to watch later. There are SO many titles I would LOVE to watch and I don't really like the fact if I don't watch it right then it may be gone when I go to look for it again. Would this be a possible option in the future?
B005T87QCI|4.0|My 6 year old loved the movie and really enjoys the game...not a long entertaining game but perfect for the amount of time I allow my son to play on the Kindle Fire HD!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I have never lived anywhere except the South.  This is a wonderful movie and shows views of both black and white.  I remember, as a child, so many things what went on in this movie.  It is very touching.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Super Natural is one of the greatest series I have seen, everyone is different and you never know what is going to happen.  And these two actors they are great my husband and I always watch the Gag Wheel and they are so funny.  Plus its filmed in Canada my father was born in Montreal Canada.  Dean is hot!!!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|What I liked most about this film was the cinamatography.  It's plot deviated somewhat from the book.  The characters were very well cast.  The story and it's plot were engaging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Dh. Dj sb. Sj. Sh. Sj bxj bs. Sj. Sj. Sj. Db. Dh. Dj. Dj dj. C hf ch. Dj. Xjcb Bc. Bc cnc. Nc. B finch fy f nc fjc f game beat best game ever my family thinks best game too
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I thought this was gonna be a simple kids' game...but I was wrong. It's challenging to try to get those hyper little mice to their rockets! I love trying to figure it out, but I wish it was easier to go back to watch the action once I finally get it right. But, anyway, it is still so much fun.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|As others have said previously, this is a very good looking & high quality watch, especially for the price. It beats $30 timex watches from walmart by a longshot. One thing I noticed is that the faceplate inside the watch is very glossy, I would have liked it if it was flat or satin (I don't know about the colored models). To me the gloss looks a little tacky and can be difficult to read when there are reflections on it. The lume is very good. The crown can also be difficult to pull out if you have large fingers. That being said, this is a classy looking watch that you won't notice on your wrist, not something to depend on if your profession requires it...<br /><br />There are three notable things I think I should mention:<br /><br />1. The first is that I haven't been able to keep this watch running consistently. The movement works great, and accurately; but if you don't actively wear the watch the entire day it will be dead the next morning.<br /><br />2. The second is that Amazon and other website lists this watch as having a 7S26B movement, the watch I have states that is has a 7S26C movement. Also, it lists the band as being 16.8mm wide? I measured it and it is actually 18mm, so keep that in mind if you plan to buy another band for it. The band that it comes with is decent, it's a little rough/bulky though. I plan on buying a low-key leather band for it eventually, I think a leather band would really bring the watch up a few notches.<br /><br />3.  Lastly, as others have noted, this watch is a gray-market item if you buy it from amazon. There is no warranty card/information included with the watch, even though amazon states that there is a two year warranty included with the watch. So, I don't really know what is up with that. It's a relatively inexpensive watch though, just don't get it wet.<br /><br />Overall this is a very cool watch and a great value. People complain about the small size of it, when you wear this watch with nicer clothes ( a dress shirt), the smaller size seems to work really well. I hardly notice that is even there when I wear it, which is the main reason why I bought it. I think the self-winding issue I mentioned will work itself out eventually as I wear it more.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Very challenging game. I found gameplay easy to  learn. I enjoyed it greatly. The concept is a little disturbing and funny at the same time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Of course this book is awesome, I do wish though that it had ended a little differently is all but it was still good
B0091REZMW|1.0|So! This game, basically, tried to fit every little gimmick that they could in here. Energy; unlockable rooms; &#34;missions,&#34; &#34;attractive female mentor,&#34; you name it, it's probably in this game. This makes for one crapload of text bubbles that pop up everywhere whenever something new pops up, which is about every level or so.<br />I beg of you, go read the &#34;most helpful review,&#34; which is strikingly more eloquent and says what I'm trying to say a lot better.<br />And please, save your brain cells.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great ending for a moving story.  But consider that it is a war story and you will lose some characters that you love.
B0055G9L9U|5.0|this is another movie that I have watched at least twent times by now.  One of the first movies i purchased for my kindle.  Very funny.  Simon and his always sidekick at their best.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I'm getting used to this one and enjoying it.  It's so nice to make lists and then know where to find them the next day.  I have always made lists but the next day comes and I have forgotten where I put that list.  Using the Kindle I know the list I made is always there.  I can see so many possibilities for this.  Thanks.
B004021GKW|4.0|I purchased these for our older daughter who has narrow feet.  The bulky Crocs remind me of something Fred Flintstone might wear, and I don't find them flattering at all.  Last year, she had the ballet slipper-style Crocs, and she liked those.  These are cute and perfect for the pool.  She wears a size 2 now, but I find that Crocs run large, so I ordered a size 1 for her.  They fit her nicely with a bit of room to grow too.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I have looked through the entire thing and it appears to be very doable.  For me that's saying a lot.  Any exercise is better than no exercise so I'll give this a try.  To begin with I think everyone needs a program to follow.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|this game is so addicted.I played for hours and I can't. get enough of it.I play for hours in and it still addictive.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I see these summaries and reviews talking about the love Heathcliff and Catherine shared which destroyed everything and I almost laugh. Heathcliff destroyed everything. He robbed and abused Catherine's nephew and her daughter. And he MURDERED her brother! Does that sound like something someone would do to the loved ones of someone they claimed to love so deeply? Heathcliff only knew possession. He wanted Catherine to be HIS, just like Hareton and Linton. This is proven by that final grave stunt.<br /><br />Anyway, I gave this three stars because with all the characters there was only a hand full of names which were used over and over with small variations. And I couldn't understand a thing Joseph said.
073937771X|4.0|I have the previous 2 books and I could only get the third one in BIG letters so, that's why am taking off a star, because the book ends up to be too large for you to hold and have a cup of tea or just to support it with your chest. The book is good though!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|From makers of How to train your dragon.... it was a cute filming with an awesome meaning at the end.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Well documented -- well written.  A gripping tale.  Helps me understand why Kim Jong is acting the way he is today!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I'm a long time HO gamer and have over a dozen on my kindle. This one is by far my favorite. Beautiful graphics and interface and many hours of gameplay involving interactivly solving a case, puzzles, hidden objects and a great story and dialogue. Well worth the spare change to play the full game.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Good copy of t.v. Series. Bright and ear worthy. Cast really took the production home. Next series should be strong.
B008476HBM|5.0|Cannot go wrong with Jane Austen. Love story, life story, and she leaves me wanting more. Elizabeth and I are very simmular.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|The essence of the film was good and the copy was very good. Not much lost in the translation...thanks. When
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|\\"The 20/20 Experience\\" is a unique outing for an artist, one that only a select few like Justin Timberlake can get away with and still succeed. Most of the songs are like nothing heard on the radio today, but are still pleasant to the ears. Being a fan of the previous two albums, I was very anxious to get my hands on this CD. The songs take a worldly approach to music, and arrangements incorporate full bands with a horn section and multiple backup vocalists. Suit & Tie has been on the radio for some time now, mixing a pop dance hit with multiple instruments which result in a catchy good time. Mirrors, the second single, and obvious ode to his marriage; Is a great track with a great beat and wonderful, meaningful lyrics. Other excellent tracks are Pusher Love Girl, which has a strong finish and the catchy Tunnel Vision which has \\"single\\" written all over it. The other tracks fill in nicely, and you can tell that Justin and Timbaland have expanded on their \\"fusion\\" and \\"interlude\\" premise that was spread throughout \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds.\\" The packaging is well done, and comes in a standard plastic CD jewel case. This album as a whole is already one of the best selling of 2013, and I expect it to win many awards, into next year. The other \\"half\\" of the 20/20 Experience is due out later this Fall, but these first 10 tracks (10 out 20, get it?) will definitely keep Justin Timberlake and pop music fans occupied until then.  Glad to see Justin return to what he does best, and I am sure the music industry is happy as well, as not many other artists do it better.  Do yourself a favor and make sure you check out \\"The 20/20 Experience.\\"
000614182X|5.0|Far better than the Russell Crowe movie and alsofar better than Horatio Hornblower for  sailing/ British Navy aficionados like me
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This has to be one of the best and mort addictive games ever created!!  Talk about hooked. I have it on 3 different devices, as I need my Subway Surfer fix on a daily basis.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surf is a very entertaining game.  It cool that they change cities.  But the only minor problem is that most of the time the game frezzes and is unable to use.  I would have rated five stars but it was just one complaint.  So I recommend subway surf but if you have a complaint about this issue I assure you that I will inform amazon head quarters and it will.be fixed.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|I probably over-bought when I got this, as I only needed to connect my Heil Sound &#34;The Fin&#34; microphone to my computer, but now I have room to grow, and it does exactly what I need now.  Plug the XLR cable from the mic into the top left port, run a dual-RCA-plug-to-3.5mm-Male-plug cable from the CD/Tape output ports to the &#34;line in&#34; (blue) plug in the back of the computer, turn everything on, and boom, you can record right into the free software Audacity makes.  Easy.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After watching Seasons 1 & 2 I now see what people were so excited about. I made the mistake of not recording season 3, so I will be ordering the Season 3 DVD's when they are out.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|THis  is an excellent ap for people on the go.I also have the version you pay for and I actually prefer this one. I prefer this ap because it has all the features.
0425252868|5.0|This was a great read. I have read many WWII accounts, and this is one of the best I've ever come across. Adam and Larry did an amazing job of taking this true life event and making it feel like you were there.<br />My wife even enjoyed reading it - She doesn't normally go in for war history, but she could hardly put it down either. Fritz's wartime experience gave me new insight into the relationship between the Luftwaffe and the NAZI party. The story of how Fritz and Charlie eventually met is equally compelling (and emotional).
B0006GVJEE|5.0|I always liked this movie, but i wanted to see the whole thing in its entire format when i found out about it. All the bonus stuff is cool, but i like that they put all the deleted scenes back in the movie
B007PAAO0Y|1.0|I am a huge Bobby Womack Fan and was dissapointed with his new release The bravest man in the universe. It did not click with me. Bobby Womack music has always been about a story about life and love. He should have remembered the advice of and old friend Sam Cooke years ago for him to write songs that people can feel and can relate to like Harry Hippie, and across a hundred and tenth street.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very fun little game, have no complaints, lots of replay value, can be frustrating at times but it makes you think about what you have to do.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Awesome! Great movie for kids and adults. I would recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys feel good family films.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Very cool weird movie, always liked that type of movie. Dont know what to compare it to. Its kind of it own concept.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Very good story, and building the foundation of who the characters are why they do what they do. This is one of the best comic book to screen rendition. Highly recommend this movie.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|although there were some changes to the script, this version closely follows the stage production.  and being able to have the combo pack with a dvd, blue ray and digital copy gives me the freedom to watch it on my tv, my computer or my kindle fire.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|This version from Sam Mendes gives us James Bond as an alcoholic, pill-popping, burnt-out case, sort of Superman as Alex Leamas.  Gone entirely is the sophistication and humor that added to the enjoyable aura of pre-Craig Bond pictures.  That said, this should effectively revise the franchise, which with (especially) Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan had grown a little too jokey and science-fiction-oriented for my taste.  On the other hand, the cynical, amoral spy who has seen too much has become a very familiar figure.  Curiously we are introduced to Moneypenny at the very end of the film as Bond meets the new M--Ralph Fiennes, of all people.  The one thing that irritates me about this genre, as with almost all action movies, are the ways in which, with minimum or no damage, the hero survives falls, fights and bullet wounds that in the real world would be either fatal or totally debilitatiing.  Maybe future Bond films will be a tad more realistic about this.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|I read this book quickly and found it interesting, but it lost steam toward the end and became very predictable.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game, but was very angry when it wouldn't update to the Sidney version. Really mad, I wanted Kim. :(
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I didn't want to read this book, but it was chosen as our book club selection.  I ended up loving it.  A wonderful book.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|This album was a gamble didn't know much bout the artist but really well put together album at a great price
B009O2XY12|1.0|is a strong word but I really didn't even get a chance to try it. It would not download on my Kindle Fire. Quite frustrating to say the least.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|I chose this movie cause i like disney movies for the most part.  I would say its for children 7 and up more so  cause its a little dark in its content.  meaning in the first several minutes a boy meets a girl, they show them growing up, getting married, they try to have a child but cant, they grow old and then the wife dies.  I think a kids movie should be more upbeat than that.  An then later one of the boy/old guys heros from childhood is meet  and it starts off good but then it turns and he is tring to kill the boy/old man.  So i liked it but If you are thinking about showing it to your kids you may want to give it a test drive first.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Great show, nothing but laughs and a awesome vocabulary lesson. I would recommend to all ages, high school memories will come flooding back.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|My daughter gave us season one. We watched the whole series and could not wait for the second season to come to Netflix so we bought season two. When season three comes out we will purchase that. Start with season one, I guarantee you will be hooked.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Re watching this series via Prime...I like it better now as a Star Trek fix more than when it was shown originally.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is really fun because it is addicting and its free! I also love that it is kid friendly and great for all ages.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|I just finished reading it and the concept is great.  I cannot wait to work on these new principle.  I am a long time fan of bodyweight exercises this book takes it to the next level.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|I love this game too much I spend many hours playing in the daytime !!!!!<br />Hope everybody else like too
B00947N6UG|5.0|We took two 3 year olds and a 6 year old to this gem.  We were concerned about the toddlers running everywhere and ruining the movie.  From start to finish, their eyes were glued to the screen.  As soon as we left, my husband and I discussed buying it for the family.  We gave it to them for Easter, which was perfect timing considering the storyline.  I love how the story has enough tradition in it as well as some flexibility for parents who may have their own twists, if that makes sense.  It is visually appealing, though dark at times.  One daughter was a bit afraid of the boogeyman in the story, but we took the theme from the movie and used it in our own home about how only kids who believe in him can be afraid.  It sure helped!
0784011710|5.0|great movie to watch  when you want a quite night by yourself.  wish there was a sophie's choice two this was such a good movie
B000RO9VJK|5.0|It is very easy to read and understand, supply real life business scenario.  Take you through the steps of growing your business.
B0064QNS62|3.0|After seeing that this game is actually a sequel, that must mean the first was a good enough game. So I gave this a try. Overall, I'm not impressed but the game is fun enough that I'll keep it around.<br /><br />Gameplay involves using a virtual keypad and buttons to move Marv around in the levels. You can move left, right, and jump up or use platforms or teleporters. The main objective in each level is to walk on all designated platforms to light them up. Collecting gems and killing monsters is just extra credit to give you a high score. Your score adds up until you beat all 59 levels or until you run out of lives. Game over just means your score will reset to 0, but you can start on any level that you've unlocked. Marv has many hazards to avoid such as fire (the most annoying), monsters that just drone around, and falling from high heights.<br /><br />Sounds are okay as well as the music, but both seem very limited. Only simple sounds of picking up gems or killing monsters play, and there's no background music. Graphics are simple but a little crude. For example, Marv often looks like a Cyclops with his eyes drawn so close together, and his clothes in-game look a lot like Mario's. All of this fits together alright for the game style.<br /><br />The levels start off easy but quickly get difficult (level 5!!), especially since the controls are little awkward. This can make the game a little frustrating... the random fire pits are horrible! But with some practice and patience I am able to improve my progress.<br /><br />This game takes the common platformer style and adds different elements to it to make Marv the Miner 2 a somewhat unique game. However the sum of its parts makes it only a decent game that can get a little frustrating. It's fun enough to challenge you and keep you playing a little longer, but this game is nothing extraordinary.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Outstanding young new talent. Original music with a different sound. Loved him from the beginning of his audition on American Idol until his win. Eagerly awaited his first CD and was not disappointed.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Mini Squadron is a must-have for shoot-em up fans and anyone else looking for a simple yet addictive game to just pick up and play!  With many levels and even more airplanes to choose from, there's tons of replay value to be had here.  The game has so much character, with each plane animating in their own cute way.  Everything about it feels high quality, and the chaotic dog-fights are beautiful to just even watch.  The asking price of $3 may be a little steep, but Mini Squadron is a great game addition to your app collection.<br /><br />Graphics - Gorgeous graphics, from the detailed background scenery to the colorful planes trailing streams of smoke or flames.<br /><br />Sound - Plenty to hear when planes, bullets, bombs and missiles are flying!  The music is very interesting as it is just different popular classical pieces played on a piano.  It fits very well with the comical and chaotic gameplay.<br /><br />Controls - One of the few apps that doesn't slack on its virtual joystick and button controls!  They work so well you don't even think about them, and its hard to when you are fighting for your life against wave after wave of enemy fighters.  I noticed the controls are very flexible and forgiving, allowing you to press the button without your finger having to be too accurate on the button.<br /><br />Gameplay - Very addicting!  On my Galaxy Note 2, the game runs great and loads fast.  There's plenty of challenge completing the levels and tons of fun unlocking and playing as different planes, and there's A LOT of planes to choose from.  The random power-ups also help keep things interesting and humorous, with my favorite power-up being the mega laser!  A multiplayer mode is also included for up to 2 players versus each other over the Wi-Fi.  I haven't tried this, but sounds like a very fun feature!  Would be better if it were cooperative instead of competitive though.<br /><br />5 of out 5 stars!  Aim high!
B00632HWOG|3.0|Doesn't remind me of the older scheme, so it felt weird navigating or reading on it for me, so I just open up my browser, instead.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Great movie! You end up rooting for the underdog! Atom the robot becomes almost real to you. Wonderful movie for all ages (mild profanity a couple times) male and female alike. I went to see it with a friend expecting to be bored out of my mind. Just the opposite. I have purchased 2 copies, one for myself and one for the grandkids.Spielberg had his hand in this as well as Sugar Ray Leonard. Pop some popcorn and settle in for an enjoyable 2 hours! Way too bad it bombed at box office as they left it wide open for a sequel. Oh well, probably would not have been as good anyway.
B009VIZDLI|3.0|This book had some genuinely amusing moments, but the subject of a compulsive obsessive was not to my liking although by the end of the book, he became more likeable.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|Quickly becoming my all time favorite cd. Second cd is mostly instrumental with background vocals, unusual for the Eagles. Plug it in and sit back after a rough day at work. Frey and Henley are genius when it comes to songwriting. Guess that may be why they have been around so long, not to mention they are all incredible musicians.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|As is typical of Kate Morton, she writes a complicated story switching back and forth.  Sometimes it can be irritating, but overall I like her writing and look forward to reading another of her stories.
B001N4Q4MA|5.0|I knew that the kids would like this, and even my husband really wanted to see it for some reason, but I was surprised that I ended up liking it too. Funny and has a really good message, &#34;A person's a person, no matter how small.&#34;
B007L3BMGA|3.0|This book is one to take on an aircraft and, when finished, leave it for the cleaners.  Not terribly well written and overall somewhat boring.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've been using Pinterest for some time on my home computer, but it was so nice to find an app for using it on my Kindle Fire.  Thanks!

B005LAII44|5.0|We fans finally get to see G.I. Joe: Retaliation after waiting nine months due to being converted to 3D, the poor box office performance of Battleship at the box office, negative test screenings from the studio that was so bad and so they decided to add an additional scene that has (Roadblock and Duke playing Call of Duty) while pushing its release back, including showcasing Channing Tanem's Duke in the first fifteen minutes of the film involving a real key scene that end up in death due to him being a bigger star thanks to Magic Mike, 21 Jump Street and The Vow. Retaliation was originally to release on June 29, last summer but with the ideas mentioned above, Magic Mike and Ted both took its place and would had faced The Amazing Spider-Man a few days later and it would had killed the film despite they both going after the same audience, Brave from a week previously, Ted in its original July 13 release date and The Dark Knight Rises weeks later, which somehow made sense and now will end up about $400 million worldwide due to the 3D boost and the international popularity of the stars. Not bad for a film that was delayed by nine months and given mixed to negative reviews from the critics and audience members, something we don't see in a film everyday. Unlike The Wolfman which its problems began when the film was pushed away from its November 2008 release at $90 million and reshoot most of the movie while adding more money to the already $90 million and it never came out until February 2010 and became a box office disater both critical and financally and G.I. Retaliation made the better mistake by not wasting additional money reshooting the whole film again (and the 3D just payed for itself) than the Wolfman. It's a turn your brain off movie when you walk in the door and or takes you back to when G.I. Joe the cartoons were back in the 1980s!<br /><br />This is much better than The Rise of Cobra, that film was a disappointment to the G.I. Joe name, we get to see Cobra Commander just like the cartoons, The Rock as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as Joe kicking butt and taking names, Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes fighting, the VFX is much better, the story and characters are campy but all in good fun, the RZA stinks as blind master and no offense should stick to music, Destro gets a sort of cameo apperance from The Rise of Cobra. We will see a third installment which was just went through its process of one step closer of being made! See the famous mountain fight scene with Snake Eyes, Jinx and Storm Shadow against a series of red ninjas that is worth seeing over and over again!mmander just like the cartoons, The Rock as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as Joe kicking butt and taking names, Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes fighting, the VFX is much better, the story and characters are campy but all in good fun, the RZA stinks as blind master and no offense should stick to music, Destro gets a sort of cameo apperance from The Rise of Cobra.

B0049J3QAY|5.0|really good family movie. i rented for my son who is 3, he sat down through the whole movie twice.
B008EKON56|4.0|This product is awesome it is the item that I needed to connect my IPOD to my receiver.  I have an IPOD Classic 120GB that I connected to an older receiver without an IPOD dock.  I have used high end level audio cable from receiver to IPOD headphone jack and even with fancier cable (thicker, more insulated, better plugs at the end and a higher price) the sound is still lower and thin.  This cable produced increased volume that works better with my speakers plus the fact I can hook a cable to charge the device is a plus.  For $10 this is a great way to enhance IPOD to home stereo. There are still limitations with IPOD to receiver but this definitely reduces the drawbacks.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Um it's messing up can you fix it please still giving it 5 stars because it used to work and it is awesome
B00BVVA138|5.0|Best album since alive or just breathing!! And easily one of the best albums of the year. Killswitch Engage is Back!!!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game.  My kids got me started playing it.  Now we compete to see who can get the higher score.
B006YC74E8|4.0|I don't think the layout is as user friendly as it could be but for a free app it does everything I need to do basic edits on my photos.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Could be better, but I like it. It is annoying to not get very many gems or coins, and have to always buy food for your horses.  Also, all the tack and horses cost waaaaay too much.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I think one of my kids downloaded this game because I still don't know what this game is about .I guess I'll find out huh?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subways Surfers is one of the best games I have ever played. And trust me I have played tons of video games. The only bad thing about Subway Surfers is that when you're at one location and next it changes you can't go back to your memories in the previous ones.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Jessica Chastain is excellent and I was completely pulled in to the story with her. All of the story lines and the effects were carried out with precision and very believable. The last action sequence told the gritty story of how an operation really goes down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is spool cool. When you play this game you just don't want to stop until u get a high score. This game also upgrades the game with asking. Get subway surfers FOR FREEEEE.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|keept my interest  suspence kept you on the edge of seat  and story line you could just about see this happening
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love love love this game I am so addicted but just think it could go a little bit faster

034580404X|5.0|Havent finished reading yet, but very intrigued so far. I would definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys reading a juicy novel.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|My favorite character was Dr. J.  He is what make the doctor profession great.  His bedside manners were impecable!!  Of course Lisabeth makes the story line.

B00785P2QC|5.0|dude I only had it for four minits and I love it so if u are reading this get it
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Gritty inner-city police drama with complex characters and conflicts.  Documentary cinema-verite style heightens the tension.  So far, worth viewing and enjoying.
B00BBF3BO0|5.0|I am implementing Trello in our small town office to allow sharing of committments and ideas. So far everyone involved is excited about the possibilities. And we love the web based platform. It is so easy to work from multiple locations as well as documenting that occasional night thought. I have the app on my smart phone and use it everyday.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I love history, so I really liked this movie. I learned a lot, especially because the film mirrors the actual events and doesn't try to revise them. I felt, however, the film is a bit too long. The acting is great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it will blow your mind. so adicting. omg. did I mention its addicting. omg omg omg. super cool. super cool.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I'm surprised by the low ratings this film is getting - I guess it's because there are a few historical innacuracies and the rebels from Connecticut are taking it out on the movie. If you are treating it as entertainment based on history, not a historical documentary, it's enjoyable, well acted, good cinematography and an interesting look at an amazing period of time.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|This is a great cd, but I am a Nickelback fan.  So if you like their music, I would really suggest you order this cd for your collection.<br />Every song has a meaning and purpose to peoples lives and relationships..........
B002HNA95E|5.0|This album has everything you need combined into one and I was very pleased with the result. You will hear most of her newer and older songs from throughout her career. (I particularly enjoy the 80s sound) Highly recommend this for anyone's collection! You won't be disappointed!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Kitchen house was a good book to read . I liked the characters and by the end became vested in them. Although slow at first it did pick up and by the last.100 pages I couldn't put it down.
B00BYKIKJS|3.0|I don't think I'm going to be popular if I say that SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK starts brilliantly and then peters out, as if screenwriter/director David O. Russell has lost the courage of his convictions.  The premise is an original one: Bradley Cooper's bipolar life-wrecker Pat has to come to terms with living in the community once more after eight months incarceration, and teams up - chiefly due to his mother's machinations - with Jennifer Lawrence's equally disturbed widow Tiffany.  The two of them have a stormy relationship which goes through fits and starts until they start rehearsing for a dance competition.  The camerawork at the beginning is excellent, with the use of a handheld camera coming uncomfortably close to the actors' faces to signify how Pat and Tiffany's mood-shifts can have destructive effects on those around them.  As the film unfolds, however, so the study of bipolar disorder gets lost, and we are plunged instead into a romcom that culminates on the dance-floor, rather in the manner of Baz Luhrmann's STRICTLY BALLROOM from the Nineties.  The end is predictable.  Director Russell also wastes the opportunity to explore the relationship between Pat and his father (Robert de Niro), an equally obsessive addict of the Philadelphia Eagles.  One wonders whether the father's OCD did not impinge upon his son, but the connection is not taken up.  SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK is certainly watchable, but represents something of a missed opportunity.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I checked on the AccuWeather .... it has all kinds of problems ... slow ...<br /><br />I &#34;caved in&#34; and purchased the AccuWeather Platinum and it works perfectly .... fast and updates are available to the various cities.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This book came recommended by my 92 year old neighbor.  We always trade our favorite books and have similar taste in what we find enjoyable.  This book is easy to read, straightforward, but keeps you guessing.  The characters are well-developed and the setting of an old estate in England circa WWI is captivating.  Love it!!!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I want a quick clock ... nothing more.  I found this hard to read and very, very dark.  Choice of Antique clock, digital and one regular are not enough for me.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Lots of easy challenges for someone like me who wants an easy game to pass the time.  Graphics are cool.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Gerard Butler and Jamie Fox... great adversaries in a plot that takes a few unexpected turns.  Have watched this movie several times and still love the way Butler's character exploits the &#34;grey areas&#34; of the law to exact judgement on the ones who wronged him.  Movie has a lot of strong material that may not be suitable for some viewers, but given the storyline... that is not unexpected.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|I had been wanting to read this book since i first heard about it, but kept putting it on the back burner (you all know how easy thatis to do). Well don't wait any longer- because it is a great book by a great American hero. Read it now- and learn a little about a true hero and some of the sacrifaces that our military men and women go through for our country.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I highly recommend this series!  Very well-written and engaging.  The characters are extremely well-developed and the twists and turns of the story keeping you guessing. I highly recommend it!
B000025XKM|3.0|The story of Nick Drake is sad and compelling, and his music is very much the same. There isn't anything on this album that's going to change that, but I did expect more.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I highly recommend this series!  Very well-written and engaging.  The characters are extremely well-developed and the twists and turns of the story keeping you guessing. I highly recommend it!
B000005RQT|4.0|That's how people like their Deep Purple isn't it? Nothing bad going on, but the quality is somewhat mixed. It has the original version of &#34;Child In Time&#34; though, which is the strongest Purple thing I've ever heard. After more than forty years it still makes my mind race while my body quivers, churns and gyrates.
0684857219|5.0|A little outdated but all in all this is the best book you can buy to get started with. Has everything you need to know from exercises to diet.
B00BI745AA|3.0|Russel Crow as most know was a terrible singer but he had one of the bigger roles in the movie so it was hard to watch. I was happy when he finally killed himself off. Moved pretty slow for a musical.
6305537321|5.0|I fell in love with this movie and just had to have it to watch at all times. It is such a classic. Great service as well!
0307887898|5.0|This book helped me to think differently about a startup. I opened up a lot of new techniques that one should consider when launching a new product to the market.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've received on time and the installation was easy. Last cooler, original from intel, already had some paste on it. Cleaned the cpu, did a little circle in the middle of cpu interface and installed the new cooler.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I can't get the Sydney update I go to update the app and instead of saying update it said open. I still like the app, though.
B0070Z4LLW|4.0|The writers used a lot of the premiss from the first film. However, they blended this one into the first very well and there was not a lot of new technology to confuse the time line.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I could not put it down. I had been meaning to read this book since I had first heard of its translation, but had never gotten around to it. That is until after the movie was released. I forbade myself from seeing the movie and I am very glad that I did as the movie would have spoiled one of the best reads I've had in quite a long time.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I didn't want to put the book down, it was a beautiful story. A definite unexpected ending that's definitely pulls at your heart strings. It's a happy ending but at the same time it's not the happy ending in the fairy tales or the ending I wanted. But this is real, life is real and its not always a happy ending.
B0084670FU|1.0|If I could give it a 0, I would.<br /><br />Great premise - 6 peoples' lives intersecting around a particular event.<br /><br />Ultimately, there was nothing interesting about the characters, so you don't really care what happens.<br /><br />YMMV
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I'm not by any means a thermal compound expert but the friend of mine who installed my fan said that is the best thermal paste he has ever used and it is a great value for the price, not to mention, you can use it numerous times due to the amount you get. 3.5g fpr $7.00, thats only .50 cents per gram. I think i got a real bargain.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Recommended to me by my daughter...laughed and cried as I turned each page. A story to be retold to non-readers.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Seeing it once is not enough. Amazingly well done.  Acting, voices and music mesmerizing.  Don't miss it but have tissues handy
B002UKVO3U|4.0|There is a lot of great action here but, the truly interesting thing about this movie is how it explores the topic where our humanity lies in an ever increasing age of technology. When you get to the point where you can download an entire personality into a new brain and everyone's body is more machine than flesh where is the 'ghost' that is us.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|For many it is too sinister and gruesome ... but it's entertainment and it keeps you engaged the full episode.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|A lot of action, the cinematics are brilliant at points.<br /><br />Doesn't come across as much of a Bond flick, but a good (if unbelievable) spy thriller.<br /><br />I go to Bond for the gadgets, for the car, for the women (yes, I am that shallow)<br /><br />Gadgets in this flick is a gun that is provided without even an extra clip of ammunition.<br /><br />Q, boring, hackerish activities on computers.... Uh yeah, now let's assume that the villain is really trying to draw Bond in, so yeah, maybe he planted a readable string into an encrypted text.<br /><br />M, well, Dame Dench, never a big fan of her, or the portrayal they have of her in the movies.  I'm sure she's a nice woman in real life, but when Bond is pushed to shove, even he defines her as a &#34;B****&#34;.<br /><br />Just not a lot of likability on the part of the characters.<br /><br />Still I managed to put on &#34;Bond Blinders&#34; treat it as a spy flick and from that perspective though the actions of the characters at major plot points were questionable it was entertaining.<br /><br />There's also a special guest star towards the end of the movie, they gave it quite the nice send off.<br /><br />Definitely worth a look-see, but nothing that I have any intention of seeing a second time any time soon.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Loved finding this show and then getting hooked. The premise is engaging, even if you don't like action heroes and &#34;good vs. bad&#34; type shows. Love the interrelationships, the twists and turns, and the well done concept of interspersing flashbacks into the &#34;now time&#34; plot lines. Definitely worth watching ... hope we get a Season 2!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|By this time, you should have an idea of the format of this thing, Castle mystery writer, has the hots for Beckett, but for whatever reason seems incapable of articulating that.<br /><br />Front story, the murders are decent, if a bit formulaic;  like a bad poker player, they telegraph the killer in a lot of instances, so it becomes more of &#34;Okay I know who likely did the dirty deed, now how exactly do they tie into the crime itself?&#34;  Instead of trying to figure out who actually did the crime.<br /><br />There are a few episodes that are just okay;  They progress the plot and little else.<br /><br />The back stories... .well, there's a bit of overacting but for the most part there's a goodly amount of interaction and humor done by some excellent actors.<br /><br />But there are other episodes that are quite entertaining and worth viewing more than once.<br /><br />At this point this series is my go-to for entertaining episodes<br /><br />Highly recommended
B005HED11Y|5.0|Very well done.  I love the redone ship, planets, weapons, and okay, basically all of the special effects.  It brings Star Trek up to the present day--apart from the mini skirt uniforms, which I hate.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're not a &#34;I Hate Change&#34; purist, you may like the alterations.  Let's face it.  Like old Doctor Who, Star Trek needed a facelift that its spinoffs couldn't achieve. :)
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Well written and informative essay about the true life events of a doctor who previously had no belief in near death experience.  It's an honest portrait of what happened to him while in a coma, his feelings afterward and the scientific data which justifies exactly how miraculous this is.  Another example of science proving the Bible.<br /><br />After reading, &#34;Heaven is For Real&#34; in which Heaven is viewed with childlike wonder and acceptance, it is a great progression to enjoy,&#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; written from an adult's perspective; a once skeptic turned true believer.<br /><br />It was an easy read except for the parts with the scientific data.  I understand the need for a full explanation and that is what's great about this author.  However, I got a bit lost in the technical parts, otherwise it would have been a 5-star for me.
B008YRVW0I|2.0|I bought the starter and had no problem, but after I bought the game it froze up on my Kindle
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for Season #4!  An extremely well written series with superb acting!  Just sorry to see some characters will not be returning.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I'll be reading this more than once to be constantly reminded.  Small book with so much information. I've recommended it to my friends.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|It's a great movie, but, it stopped a lot to buffer which really got on my nerves. I had only rented it, so if you buy it it might be different.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|This app never open in my tablet after download it after severals attemts finally I decline to try to open back
B00338QENI|3.0|I was excited to get this book, I love the story line and finding out how science has evolved over the years.  The book however became pretty repetative, at one point I thought surely this must be over soon, only to find out I was only half way through.  I think it could have been condensed considerably
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it arrived in really excellent shape and I hope to do business with this company again.
B0096HL33G|1.0|Need I say more. None of the characters were engaging. I found the whole thing to be rather flat.  Glad I didn't pay for it
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is fun to play.  I wish that diamonds could be gained more quickly without spending money.  Some of the tasks seem to be rather difficult to achieve without spending actual money.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Being able to access my Facebook page from my Kindle or I phone makes my life so much easier and enjoyable. This is great.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Now I find it strange that they would not put in the deleted scenes; lit explains so much especially when Edward hit Jacob.  GREAT!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Attention all fans of temple run. There is a new game called subway surfers and it is awesome and just like temple run!!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I really like this game &amp; even though its a manage a theme park... it doesn't feel underwelming but if your playing &amp; cant't pay any real money it is prefable that you have somthing do while you wait for the dinos to give you more money
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Wonderfully mind enlightening novel, that shows just how beautifully our mind defends, protects and continues to grow with us. For anyone who has not understood a breakdown and the hope it can teach!
1419705849|5.0|my son has read everyone of these books.  he dowent put it down and is ussually done in a couple hours but he gets every one that comes out.  Now if they can only write something my other son is interested in
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I have to sign in every single time!  I mean' , how stupid is that.  This is supposed to save time-
0515142247|5.0|Was a little worried about readying books 1 &2 Back to back.  I shouldn't have been.  I am reading book 3 now.  Wish I had more time to read!
B003K16P3M|5.0|A fun adventure with some very loving characters. I found this book hard to put down and I was happy with the ending.
B009SCRERI|5.0|This demonstrates an inherent love of family even if new and unexplored. It also demonstrates love of friends and community. Loved as an adult. Children loved it too. Definitely one that can be viewed multiple times and enjoyed each time.
B0091LS07E|5.0|What happened to me with Alicia Keys is similar to what happened with Taylor Swift.  I only heard one song and I loved it and then I ran and bought the CD in Amazon.  Both are great, Taylor's songs (written by her) are out of this world, and Alicia Keys rendition of &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; gave me goosebumps.  So much talent. Thank God is channeled in a positive way.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|fun game a must play. like the fact I can actually get something done without waiting long hrs.just try it
B004EF8AJA|5.0|I truly loved this show.  It was an amazing show.  I recommend this to everyone.  I would like for there to be subtitles though.  Rivals Pride and Prejudice in my mind.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had not watched this series, but at the suggestion of several friends I finally took the time to start it.  I was hooked after the first episode and couldn't stop.  (I was in bed with the flu so watched all 3 seasons in 2 days).  Can't wait for more!
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|It had some funny moments.  It was just OK.  More for 15 year old boys.  Their type of humor. Wouldn't buy it.
B004PGAQMW|4.0|Our family saw it in theaters, and we just had to add it to our Family Collection / Library...<br /><br />My son luvs it and watches it frequently, I luv the twist in the story so I get a kick out of it...
B000SGSU58|3.0|I am starting to find this writer long winded and not quite as action packed as other novels. Not as even as mysterious in the plot  & characters development. Hope his next read in better
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|Found it a bit more gory than the first one of this series, however it was great, and worth it, not meant for children under the age of 13 yrs...<br /><br />Other than that, it is very close to the Comic...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun, my kids and I both love it. It is easy to play and better than temple runner by far.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This app is very sweet and great for anyone who loves horses. I love the choices of horses to include zebras and unicorns. Very cute for a young girl who wants a pony!
B007REV4YI|4.0|Very good Bond. It was surprisingly slow for a Bond film. Daniel Craig did a nice job. Judi Dench was superb. Javier Bardem is an excellent villain. Although Craig is aging, Bond never gets old.
B003V5CFV8|4.0|Were things really that bad in Mississippi during the depression? But then, this is  entertainment based on stereotypes and imaginary events so I suppose there is no need for historical / societal accuracy.  As a fan of folk & bluegrass music, I enjoyed the background theme of the music but thought that the escape scenes were a bit far-fetched.  There was no explanation of how 3 white boys could break away from a chain gang with armed guards on horseback watching every move. Later, sneaking into a prison dormitory to rescue one of their trio was also a bit of a stretch.  But again, this is a movie and in movies, especially semi-comedies, anything can happen.
044024630X|5.0|This Book arrived on time and in good shape.  The price is right. Will buy more from this vendor. Thanks.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great show and it just gets better.  Love this.  And its great that its on Prime. Thank you lots Amazon.
0440243688|5.0|This Book arrived on time and in good shape.  The price is right. Will buy more from this vendor. Thanks.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I really like this app. It's sort of neat to just flip open my kindle as opposed to digging out a flashlight for quick stuff.
0385340559|5.0|This Book arrived on time and in good shape.  The price is right. Will buy more from this vendor. Thanks.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game was an absolute disappointment. I thought the game would be similar to temple run, it was but the controls were bad. Sorry but it is not a good app.
044024367X|5.0|This Book arrived on time and in good shape.  The price is right. Will buy more from this vendor. Thanks.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|Not great but fun. It was a good time eater. Maybe worth the by. But at least it was fun.
B00BS4QP60|5.0|Out of all of Blake Shelton's cds, this could very well be one of his best yet! Love it, love it love it!
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Rovio was not thinking clearly. This game is really bad and nothing like angry birds in terms of game play. Just please stick to making birds fly through a sling shot. please
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is very fun! at some points, its a little hard!! but all games have to be hard, right? and its FREE!!
0783233477|5.0|This film is very moving and the acting is superb.  Anthony Hopkin's portrayal of his character's retirement is touching and the music played at his party truly enhances the atmosphere of his time.  The rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow intermingled with What a Wonderful World as sung by Israel...K is thrilling enough to being one to tears.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Fun for all ages! Keeps you coming back for more fun all the time. Looking forward to always see what is next.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I was prepared not to like it, with Noah as the protagonist, but a good plot line and good direction came through to make this a post-apocalyptic worth seeing.  You actually cared about the characters,
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like it for a search and find but it is boring unless you arexwilling to spend money and I'm not......
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was the surprise hit of the decade.  The characters are great, although many have left and will be missed.  God knows how the English have so many good actors particularly playing Southerners, but they do...  My first sign up for a series and I still don't have it downloaded, but I have streamed as released.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|i HAVE TO READ THE BOOKS BEFORE I SEE A MOVE.  i LOVED THIS BOOK.  tHIS BOOK KEPT YOU INTERESTED BUT THE END KEPT YOU ON THE EDGE.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I have read every Jane Austen many times over, but I have trouble getting through Emma (the book).  It frustrates me to read because of the constant bickering, page after page after page.  I've read it, but not without throwing it across the room in frustration many times over.  This movie-version makes the bickering fun and pleasant.  I enjoyed the Gwyneth Paltrow version, too, but not nearly as much as this Romola Garai version.  This Romola Garai was so much more true to how Austen wrote Emma.  This is my go-to Emma.  Absolutely loved it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|And the wonderful series continues!!!  I found that I was learning about English values as well as  life between the different classes
B001NLKXK2|5.0|It really let you into the life of a person with Alzhiemers.  My mother-in-law had it and it helped me see it from her perspective, since she could not tell us.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed this book, well written and it kept me engaged and I wanted to keep reading because I wanted to find out what the character would do next.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This was a perfect gift ....for my granddaughter and the whole family!  As usual, great delivery service and perfect disc(s) quality.  The hopping eggs were a real plus!
B003O86FMW|5.0|To good to be true sometimes I say what the heck and then they get real instead of fake. Totally amazing
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|One of our favorite movies my parents even love it it too k me awile to finaly get this movie well worth it
B0032FPVKE|5.0|Perfect size for my Panasonic V10 video camera.  It has 4 compartments and everything I need fits perfectly.(camera, cables, charger and media cards)  I like the fact that you can carry it over your shoulder or on your belt.
B007SGM084|5.0|Such an easy read! Very visual and stunning! Can't wait to re-read this book again and again! I love this series!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Great, I love \\"good ol  rock and roll\\"!  Plays just as it should and is easy to down load.  I don,t think anyone could find fault with the price or product.  This was the first time I have down loaded music and it was easy even for me.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Won't show newest posts first.  I usually sees anything from the past week all scrambled together. Hopefully it's fixed soon.  The sooner the better.
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|It is fine for a young adult read, but I preferred the Uglies/Pretties books more. Maybe it is just that I read them first?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a VERY fun and addicting game. It is free which makes it even better plus you get to \\"tour the world\\"!
B0002NRQTI|2.0|Now I know a lot of you out there think of this as being bland corporate riffola, not too far removed from Roxette.<br />Well, yes, but is that so bad? Unless of course it's Duff Leper's uber-corporate riffola.<br /><br />After the vile calumny of the previous two Rush albums at least there is a bit more life on Counterparts, even if it is only on the scale of life on a tramp's vest. Lerxst has at least a couple of moments where he sounds like he might have woken up for a few seconds.<br /><br />Heck, if you've had skinful it even sounds OK played at loud volume in an open top car - just as long as your mates don't see you.<br /><br />Approach with utmost caution. Or save time and avoid.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Finally....and add free version of the game again! I was so ticked off that the developers of this game decided to make it &#34;free&#34;....yeah, no money to pay, but you have to watch an add pretty much every level and every time you want to re-play a level. And that is not to mention the add at the top and bottom of the screen that cut off a part of your play area. Super annoying and super greedy in my opinion. Way to go guys. But this version only ever has a tiny add in the screen when you choose to replay or the next level, so it is really non-intrusive. I didn't even notice it until recently! A much better version of the game. I don't care if it updates more slowly....I can play without getting super annoyed!
0375850864|5.0|I love this book. I've read it several times over-all of it, in chronological order, which isn't what I usually do. This book flows. The writing is amazing and i love the plot. It's a relatable story with a touch of fantasy. I also love the tie-in of A Wrinkle in Time, which i happen to love. My younger brother who was 10 at the time needed a mystery book for school, so I gave this to him. He loved it. When You Reach Me is awesome for all ages and genders.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|I really like to play these kinds of games. This game gives me a challenge when I'm just sitting around, which is rare.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Slow and jumbled to start, but did not take long to become completely wrapped up in this incredibly emotional story.  Could not put it down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I truly enjoyed this season and watching it on Amazon was very convenient. You should try this service out too.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|always enjoy Denzel Washington's performances. he is a very good actor. had this DVD for almost a week and watched the movie for the first time. enjoyed it. would recommend.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I gave this DVD series five stars because of its outstanding cast, beautiful cinematography and excellent adaptation of Jane Austin's book.  I really can't say enough about the cast - Romola Garai's portrayal of Emma as a youthfully confidant, meddling, but well-meaning character was so endearing it was easy to forgive her arrogant view that she knew what was best for her friends and family.  The character of Mr. Knightly was brilliantly played by Jonny  Lee Miller - always a delight to watch. He captured the essence of a man who loved deeply, but not blindly.  And Michael Gambon, who is a consummate actor, made a character that is often played as a self-centered, whining, complaining father to be a man deeply hurt and damaged by the death of his young wife - shaping his personality by the fear of losing his precious daughters.<br /><br />The historical houses, the stunning wardrobe and the beautiful landscapes contributed to make this a truly beautiful production.  I would highly recommend this set of DVDs for any Jane Austin fan or just someone who loves a good romance.
B007REV4T8|5.0|really enjoy Daniel Craig as James Bond. he never disappoints. typical James Bond flick but the story had an unexpected ending for me. would recommend this DVD
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This isn't the greatest Noise Machine that I have ever purchased, but it wasn't too bad either. I have used it a few times when traveling to help block out the noise (I live in the country). There were some settings that seemed really stranged to me - Cloths Dryer, Hair Dryer, etc. but of course you don't have to use these either. I got this app for free, so I definately think it would be worth a try especially if you are on the road with business trips and hate to pack a bulky sound machine.<br />Also, I have used this app a few times at work when the office has gotten really loud and I couldn't concetrate on my work. If you can find something that you like, but not too relaxing - then this may be something for you to try.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|You do have to have your internet on to have it sync with fb.  A lot of fun if you like keeping your speed skills up.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game, but I'm not able to figure out how to update it to the next theme. I know where to go but every time I click on purchase it says that I already have the game. Can someone please please tell me how to update it with specific information.
B007704HO6|5.0|A real inspirational journey<br />This cat stole my heart and James Bowen tugged on my heartstrings<br />More please!  So many people I have told have read this book<br />A feel good story
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Because of the title and the fact that it's a French movie that is subtitled in English may cause some people to pass on this movie.  That would be a shame.  This is a great movie; well written, well directed and well acted.  It is full of humor and humanity.  The plot of a caregiver helping a paralized man in a wheel chair sounds like it is going to be negative.  Not so!  Check it out,  You won't be sorry.
B00BL5EQLC|1.0|It never showed up so could download. I have had this problem before but would show up any in a  few hours or a day but never this longs. Who do  I contact about this matter?
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I was tired of rating items that I have not even received yet.<br />You really need to keep up with your quality control a little better. I mean....you are the ones that send out the delivery date
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game combines science and human nature to make a game that is perfect for all kindle users a most download
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Well I like it but it is kind of boring.  All you do is connect dots.  I think you should get the game if you get bored a lot or you want to waste time.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This is the best book series that I have ever read!!!! I definitely recommend this book series to anyone who loves reading good books!!!!!
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I would say every sound engineer have use this headphone before, sturdy never break. Great sound for the price. I se them for my productions good cans.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is now one of my favorite books I loved it<br />I think it's a really great book it's funny to!<br /><br />-andi Kelly
0061733199|4.0|and you will be amazed how much you learn when you are performing your NO 2.<br />Wish there are more pics though.
B00004STPT|5.0|This soundtrack is so moving and powerful! It takes you to another place and time and forces you into it.
B00AO3K05S|5.0|Must read for all sales and other people who think they are not in sales.<br />Very practical and down to earth.
B009X01C64|5.0|I prefer reading books and newspapers in portrait mode while at a desk or table. The swivel function provides that capability very easily. It is easy to swivel and the three positions allow adjustment to whatever angle you find to be comfortable. The leather cover is very nice and the elastic band that keeps the cover closed provides a way to neatly keep my stylus clipped to the Kindle. It was well worth the money.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I loved the Lord Of The Rings series but I always wondered how the ring was acquired. I enjoyed this movie as much as I did the Lord Of The Rings. I can't wait until the next one.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well written and extremely interesting, this book kept me turning pages with its smarts and wit. As our hero struggles with many challenges on his lonely sojourn, we get to mentally chew on the whys and hows of survival, and the methods utilized to work through each puzzle. A constant stream of silly humor from our lone protagonist keeps everything loose, even in the direst of straits.<br /><br />A worthy purchase! I look forward to more of Mr. Weir's work!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this game is ok. jus was bored and tried out many new games. not an amazing game but will keep u busy for a while
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book is Incredibly heartfelt and Jaycee is a true inspiration!!!! The fact that she wrote it without really any help is amazing!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Grissom kept me involved during the entire book.  The view from the servant's quarters in an old plantation was extrememly interesting.  However, there were so many characters, I had a little problem keeping them all straight.  In general, the book was well written, well researched, and masterfully delivered.
B00993G41S|4.0|Brings back the memories. We saw this when it first came out. Jamie Lee Curtis makes this a movie to watch.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Quick Read.  The author does a great job grabbing your attention right away and keeping you hooked through the whole book.  I enjoyed his writing style too.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|As usual the download was almost instant and the clarity close as you can get to HD...I cant find no problems here!
B001OFJPIS|4.0|Hello,  This is a good movie and fun to watch.  I think if you like this kind of stuff, you will enjoy this movie.  It is also appropriate for children to watch, which is a hard thing to come buy these days.  Thanks.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|My wife and I wanted a reasonably current movie to rent, with some recognizable actors in it.<br />We enjoyed the movie.
0756407125|5.0|It is a great story & holds your attention.  Is Day 3 out yet?  Oh, you and your stupid words.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Heavy, durable and everything I expected in this knife.  Great for chopping, cutting or making fire starting material. Extra thick blade so can be used as a wedge.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Fun but very glitchy. Acorns will cost a fortune and you will lose your dino when dino world comes around
B00BHU261S|4.0|Quirky movie about a quirky guy. Helen MIrren steals the show as Hitch's wife. Enjoyed it from start to finish.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|There aren't many albums I enjoy listening to over and over without skipping any songs. She is energetic, lyrical, moving, and refreshing. Other reviewers summed it up much more eloquently, but they are right, a solid 5 stars.
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|I thought this would be a funny, sometimes serious, look at approaching middle age. It wasn't a drama but was a non stop downward spiral of depression, narcissism, and bad behavior. It could have been a comedy but it wasn't funny. It could have been a drama but it wasn't dramatic. More like spending a couple of hours in a sad broken dysfunctional family. 15 minutes longer and I would have been suicidal.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|A very abrupt ending. Enjoyed the book but let down by the ending. Fast paced and definitely cannot wait for the next book.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is the second Mahjong game I got from 24/7 games and I love both of them and they're both different enough to make them interesting.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Very well acted and likeable dirt bags!  Its fun to watch the plot unfold and the characters flesh out.  I can't wait to see what kind of s*#% SAMCRO falls into next.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed to use the calculator to do percentage and most calculators you have to do it the old fashion way. This app you can and that make it so much easier to do. There's some other great features as well. Thanks for offering it for free!
B007P7UF0G|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was young.  I love the music and the songs and this DVD brought all to may home.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooooooooooo cool! I love it. And its just like temple run but better! If you dont have this app then you are totally missing out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! I really like it, if you are wondering if you want to get it, I totally recommend this app to Apple,android and kindle users.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I get on Ebay all the time to look around or shop. This app is real nice for my Kindle, works very well to look and pay when finished.
B003UMW66G|5.0|The format of the story is unusual, in that it consists of<br /><br />1) a fictional presentation of events leading to the current time.<br />2) a surmised presentation of events leading to the current time.<br />3) the actual events leading to the current time.<br /><br />The whole story is not presented in each case, just the differences, but some of the differences are stark.<br /><br />There are wonderful performances from the entire cast, but particularly:<br /><br />Jet Li as Nameless is wonderfully stoic throughout.<br /><br />Chen Daoming performance as the King of Qin is wonderfully layered and complex while maintaining dignity at all times.<br /><br />Zhang Ziyi plays a very emotionally complex Moon.<br /><br />Tony Leung as Broken Sword and Maggie Cheung as Flying Snow are amazing in a relationship that has become strained (see the film to see why).<br /><br />Then there's the spectacular visual beauty of it.  Certainly there's wire-fu, but it's not intrusive (and in fact quite necessary).  The film kind-of describes an actual event some 200 years BCE.  Kind-of sort-of.  OK, there were assassination attempts on the King of Qin, but they're really dull compared with what is depicted in this film.<br /><br />The end is something of a tear-jerker if you are prone to such things.<br /><br />My understanding is that the subtitle translations leave something to be desired, but they work well enough.<br /><br />Very strongly recommended.
B0058VW36U|3.0|My kids talked me into downloading this game. It's not the worst game I've played by far. My 7 and 3 year old love it. It's worth a shot.
B00C58MD1Y|2.0|For the first few episodes, my wife and I were really enjoying it. Then, well, it dawned on us that the FBI was more stupid about things than we would have been, or any cops on any TV show we've ever seen would've been, or even Barney Fife would've been. They don't screen people to see who has visited the villain, which would sort of be an easy thing to do. It would give them a short list of suspects, wouldn't it?<br /><br />They have a never-ending string of folks to serve the same purpose as the red shirts on away teams for the original Star Trek series. Hanging out with Ryan is certain death for any character you've never seen before. Bad guys show up everywhere. 90% of the people Ryan has ever spoken to seems to be a part of this cult... yet they won't just scour the prison visitor logs? Half of the law enforcement community seems to be in the cult. It didn't take long for this to get to be a bit silly.<br /><br />Finally, some members of the cult itself are portrayed as \\"Constitutional Radicals\\". There is a \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" flag on the wall of the cult's training camp. Seriously? This show is about people who love the US Constitution who happen to really like to kill people? Where did that come from? It's nonsense, and it is the straw that broke the camel's back for me.<br /><br />I love the acting and the casting is awesome. Too bad the writers haven't the brains to make the story credible and to keep their socialistic bias in check.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. I was completely wrapped around this book for hours . I could not stop reading. I love the characters, they were really intriguing . Holder's passion was breath taking at times. He was an amazing part in the book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone. All who have faith in the Bible and even those that need more information will profit from this Holy Book.
B000OCZ80Q|4.0|The reviews included here are NOT for the Paris Opera Ballet version of Swan Lake with Agnes Letestu and Jose Martinez and as staged by Nureyev!  Unfortunately, the reviews belong to the Marinsky version of Swan Lake with Lopatkina and Korsuntsev!  Could someone at Amazon find the appropriate reviews to include here.  Many thanks.[[ASIN:B000L43QJ2 Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake]]
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Season one picks right up where season one left off and again, I am fixed to my pc watching a GOT marathon!  Young King Geoffrey has evolved from a miserable, unlikable kid to a very dangerous young man, I can't wait to see which one turns on the other first, him or his mother!  Again, great scripts and acting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator app! It works perfectly. I use it all the time and never have a problem. It even gives the history of the problem that you enter.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|this series is very well done, I am impressed at the story lines, the scripting is very smart, the casting is brilliant and the Imp is hysterical.  I was surprised at the graphic sex, but I don't subscribe to HBO and should have expected it. You get used to it after an episode or so. There are enough twists and unexpected turns that I had to keep watching episode after episode.  I loved this series so much I bought season two the next weekend.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark Places and Gone Girl have quickly skyrocketed to the top of my &#34;Favorites&#34; list. Gillian Flynn has an incredible writing style.
0553801473|3.0|It felt like George is a bit bummed out with this book and his own series.  It feels like he does not know which way it is going and he is wandering around lost in his world of Westeros.  This is not a happy time in the series.  The reality of the difficult situations the characters are in is hitting home to some of them.  The prose felt like it was forced and rushed to get to the publisher to meet a deadline.  Because of this, it felt like a formula was taking place in the book, much like a Duke's of Hazard TV show.  There will be a car chase in the first five minutes, Boss Hogg with try a new plot to get them Duke boys.  So it is in this book.  New characters will come and old and new characters will be killed off.  Yawn.  Me thinks the plot moves too slow right now.  The characters are stuck in quicksand because the author is mired in his own creation.  So yuck.  This is a read once only book unlike some of the earlier books in the series.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love this tv show.  It keeps my attention.  Makes me want to keep watching more.  No commercials so that is an added PLUSSSSSSSSSSS.....
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Not as good as gone girl but a well told, albeit very dark, story.  Give it a read.  Not a light summer read!
B00280LYHS|1.0|This book I have read. Full of action and very interesting. I love mythological books 100%. I'm reading your other books. I love you Rick
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Although the film is interesting in that it shows the politics at the time, it tempo and genre is more like a stage play.  We did not finish watching the last 44 minutes of the play.  The movie did not keep our interest.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down. One of the BEST books that I have read. I don't agree with the reviews that say this is like the movie Sleeping with the Enemy and that it's not worth reading. I<br />think this book has a lot more twists and turns and like I said you won't be able to put it down either!
B003O86FMW|5.0|These books are so captivating and very quick reads.  I love this series! Great book for a quick read or a summer read
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|One of the best games out there my whole family love this we play this and Where's My Water all the time . They are a great way to kill time you have to use your mind and actually think witch is great but they are easy and fun enough my 7 yr old son who usually only plays Mario will sit and play this with us. The only thing I dislike about it is the help part were you have to spend money to get the power to move the ball around. we have never needed the power to get passed a level but when games like bubble birds that are very fun make it to were you have to constantly spend money to get passed levels it ruins the game. again I have not had to spend money yet on this game but if I wanted to use that power I would have to and I dislike that other than that this is a perfect game to get
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It speaks of faith and hope and shows the depth of a mothers love, which images Gods love for us.  It's message was very relevant to our world today and the message it delivers is true mirror of how we should all live when dealing with our human kind.  There will always be those who are villians and those who will take any opportunity to get rich by paupering others.  But right will win and Les Miserable brings this all out.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I loved this movie in the theatre and was super excited to get it instantly at home.  Just as good on my tv :)
B00AR9GKJY|5.0|The vinyl just sounds better, I don't care where you're from.  This is as epic as many Pink Floyd, records.  Great players.  Guthrie Govan was such a smart choice for lead guitar, and this is some of his most tasteful playing to date.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show.  It's fantastic for too many reasons to say.  I rate it as highly as is possible!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Was very fun at first. After playing for a while I found a few flaws.! sometimes my progress is lost after I shut the kindle off.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|First of all... hands off to JT for teaming up with Timberland, he make hits on everything he touches, Love him.<br /><br />My wife bought this for me cause she knows I have a man crush on JT and he hasn't failed me yet. I was expecting this to be all popped out and following all the mainstream crap that's out there, but NOPE. He put it down on this one. This is all personal and up close. Made me want to get my wife and hang out mushy-mushy like do a little bit of somethin. It's got some very good vibes and had me singing along in no time.<br /><br />I don't this album is going to appeal to the younger crowd, it very deep in meaning, but as one person said that give it one star, (I can't tell you what a single song was about). It all bout love (I think it's all about Jessica which is cool)and no one has put out a real album bout Love. It's not all that sex u up, drop it low and put that round thang in yo face, (So tired)!!!!<br /><br />When I first heard the Album, \\"Tunnel vision\\" was my favs, and then \\"That Girl\\" stuck in my head. Then While i was driving to work I caught my head bobbin to \\"don't hold the wall\\". So now I have to say that there is not one song on this that's boring(after listing the Album bout 10 times already).<br /><br />I hope he puts out another that follows Suit and tie.<br /><br />For all the 3,2,1 stars, I figure most don't know old school R&B vinyl or concepts of good love songs.<br /><br />Great Job JT
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|There's nothing like this out there right now. I've seriously have not stopped listening to this for over 4 days.
B00B9LNJ9I|3.0|Signed up right away when I heard about the realese.  I have listened to it several times at different volume levels and at different times of the day hoping that it would get better.  I realize that musicians want fans to listen and enjoy a new diverse set of songs.  So this is diverse but not for me...so sad waited a long time.  Her voice is still utterly amazing!  She is one of the few artists that sing and complete every word beautifully! But what's with the inclusive rap???  Trust me it could do without.  I think I am going to turn the \\"Delux Edition\\" into My Edition and remake my own CD without the rap.  Hopefully we don't have to wait another 5 years to do the same.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I have used real current, tv, literary, historical and even mythological characters and it still got them. I will defeat this.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I LOVE this game but once i got to level 96, it wont let me go any further. I know there is more levels but dont know why i dont have them. I have uninstalled several times hoping it would update or something but nothing!!!!
B0076794IO|4.0|Lots of intrigue and goes at a fast pace! Good for a holiday read if you are going to Europe!
B008P9M614|5.0|Have enjoyed House and wanted the series to watch whenever I wanted to. There was a shipping delay but otherwise I a total pleased with my purchase. Now I can watch the episodes in order. The videos are good quality. If you are a House fan this is a &#34;must have&#34;.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|First of all, I've been waiting a long time for a dramatic epic movie or series about the Vikings. I loved 13th Warrior when it was released, and I've read a number of novels (such as Bernard Cornwell's Saxon series) about the Viking invasion of England and Ireland. This series does not disappoint, and the sets, props, costumes, and ships are perfectly detailed. They even depict Viking battle tactics in my favorite episode, and Ragnar's crew forms a shield wall and destroys a numerically superior band of soldiers. I love the casting choices, and Ragnar is a very likeable hero.<br /><br />I will say that viewers should watch this with an open mind, and should try to have a little cultural relativism (meaning that you shouldn't judge other cultures based on the morality of your own). Ragnar's band tends to raid churches and monasteries, destroy Christian icons, and express disrespect for a nailed god (Jesus). I can easily see this turning off some religious viewers, but it shouldn't.<br /><br />So watch this series- if you like historical epic dramas, sword/ axe fights, and beautiful scenery then you'll love this show. I only wish it had been on HBO or Showtime so they could show a little more blood and more nudity.<br /><br />A few fun facts:<br />-While we have come to know the Norsemen as vikings, the term \\"viking\\" more or less described the activity of raiding. See the comments on my review for more on the origins of this word.<br />-Ragnar and Lagertha may have been real. Their characters appear in one of the sagas, but none of the sagas were ever written down until the 1300s (they were passed down through generations by storytellers, skalds). Sadly, Christianity probably had a number of these stories outlawed, destroyed, or purged of any reference to the old gods.<br />-Vikings have one of the first democratic cultures (at least they did in Iceland). Free men met at the Thing, which is depicted in the first episode.
0062238868|4.0|Really enjoyed &#34;American Sniper&#34; shows the sacrifice our warriors make every day,,, despite the politics they overcome all and get the job done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omb I have so much fun on this app! I could play it 4 hours on end! i love the creators of this!
B000PMG16U|5.0|If you like the prequels, this set is a great Blu-ray version.  It lacks some of the extras found in the more expensive box set but this is great if you just want the prequel movies in all their blu-ray glory!
B001CJJWJ8|4.0|This is an exceptionally strong cast with a powerful conductor. Don Carlo is such a complicated opera, musically and dramatically, that it is never easy to record or perform. For all of its beauty, it is an imperfect composition, in part because it was composed somewhat early in Verdi's career; reworked later (and improved). For all of its thrilling moments, there are others when the opera struggles. I like the brevity of the Fountainbleau scene, which is so disconnected, musically and otherwise, to the opera. Among all the Don Carlo recordings, the cast is uniformly strong. There are no weak voices. The scene of Phillip and the Grand Inquisitor is especially chilling. And the finale, another awkward Verdi moment, is handled with grace and considerable beauty.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great Game play it alot my grandkids got me going on it and it's lottsa of fun!!!!!!!!! FUN FUN FUN
B003U4ZQUM|5.0|I totally missed this series when it was on TV and can't wait to finish it!  The characters and plot are great and Imlovecthe unexpected twists and turns of the plot.
1419705849|5.0|Granddaughter loves these Books and this one was Great !! she don't read alot but love this book hope there is more to follow
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love the characters Rick and Kate!  Nathan and Stanna have that special chemistry to make this show work.  Ryan and Esposito make great partners. Story lines are great fun and who can beat their great crime rate!!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This is the first time I've seen a film about Vikings that paid so much attention to detail and historical accuracy. And yet the plot is so entertaining and quite addictive. As a Scandinavian-American I cannot get enough of this program.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is one of the best series that I have ever watched.  Everyone is such a great actor.  Can't wait for season 4!!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I downloaded this and thought I'd mosey through the first chapter to get a feel for the book so I'd know where to put it on my \\"when I have time\\" reading list. Two hours later I'd read the whole thing. It's a reasonably well-written novel, though I'd have trouble recommending it to someone without an interest in IT -- but it's an excellent book for somebody trying to identify all the problem areas in a traditonal IT shop. The number of times I found myself smacking myself upside the head, \\"Oh, THAT'S what I'm doing wrong!\\" would be depressing, except that this book gives me a clear path toward fewer head-smacking moments. I'll be giving this to colleagues, my direct reports, and to my boss.
B000W00Y0Y|3.0|I must just first say that I am not reviewing this particular seller, but commenting on the DVD contents. I bought this maybe a year ago in a local store and was eager to get it home and into my BluRay Home Theater system ... but it was a disappointment. Nothing like the quality of audio or video I had come to expect from BluRay. I guess it's down to the way this DVD was re-mastered, but it's an old performance and I imagine there were limits on what could be achieved.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock app is amazing! It is very easy to use and not complicated at all. Anything from days to turn off options are available. My favorite option is the ability to choose what sound you want to wake up to. You have the choice to wake up to a song out of your very own song library! Have a hard time waking up? You can just simply enable the math promblems and eveb choose their dificulties! I definitely reccomend getting this app!!
B00BKTWBMA|3.0|I have to listen to this a couple of time to wear in the &#34; old sock&#34; . some tune are pleasing right away while others will take awhile. It seems typical of Clapton's later work still worth a listen.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|Great price for this movie, love the interviews and extras. Well acted and scripted. Video quality is much better than expected...
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This was recommended by my mother-in-law.  Love Denzel but this one was disappointing.<br />He plays a drunk pilot who saves a flight then has to face his addiction.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book. I could hardly put it down. I have passed it on to everyone I know that reads a lot. Good job Kathleen Grissom, I am going to look for some other books authored by you.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I am a fan of dumb humor.  Dumb and Dumber.  Ace Ventura.  The Big Lebowski.  Anchorman.  But this movie is just too dumb.  A story about a boy who grow up with his teddy bear who becomes a lewd, swearing teddy bear.  That should say it all.  Waste of my money.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I'm addicted to this game can't get enough... I have it on my phone, my kindle, and computer!!! It's so fun and simple, drives me nuts that I can't stop playing!!! Must have game!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I watched this on my mother-in-law's recommendation.  The acting great - of course.  But I think that the story is aimed at an older crowd.
B0087EACJK|5.0|I enjoyed learning this game. It requires some thought, but not so much that it's frustrating. It's well designed and much better than I expected.
1878424319|5.0|I recommend this book to all of my clients (in counselling) and everyone I know. It's written with a spirit that what he's saying really hits you in a different way. It's one of those rare life changing books that everyone should read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is real! Real people with real problems. It's not like so many other books I have read it's better, it has a plot, a real ending, and interesting characters. It's everything I could have hoped for and more. If you like books with love, drama, strange friendships and family ties then you have found yourself the right book. With enough twists and turns to keep your interest peaked through the whole book. You might laugh or you might cry but it will totally be worth the emotional roller coaster.
B00BVVA138|5.0|Seriously, such an amazing album. A powerful return to form for an already terrific band. Loved the years with Howard as lead singer, but having Jesse back seems to have re-energized the group. Love, love this CD. The special edition is worth the extra couple bucks, too. Get it!!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|but didn't want me to fly anytime soon. I wonder if pilots are like this all over the airlines. He got was he deserved.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The Lorax was one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books, not just because it was on the banned book list, but because I loved the message of the story,  Love this movie; not as much as the original or  the book; but I haven't seen a bad Dr. Seuss movie yet!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Within the first 5 minutes I was bored. I was so excited to see this movie, but was very disappointed. I let it just play in the background while I took a nap.
B00BESJYAY|3.0|could have been great but it just dragged along.  great surf scenes though.  I paid to see it and it was not worth the price though I have seen and paid for worst.
B0024DF9MU|5.0|I originally read the book in college. Made my life soo much easier. The movie is funny and lets woman know to move on.
B0087EACJK|5.0|Like a platformer combined with a slide puzzle.  very fun.  enjoy the thinking and also the challenge of completing in time which makes for great replay.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is so good. The plots keeping you coming back showing the show. I tell people about it the show. You have peoples kill off the show that you think might stay safe on the show.
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|I purchased this case to protect my Voyager from damage in my pocket or bag. It will certainly do the job, but with a little thought, this could have been a much better case:<br />1. The headset does not quite fit in the case if inserted as per the diagram on the card that came with it. It actually fits better inserted the opposite way.<br />2. There's no provision for charging the headset with the case closed.<br />3. The skin on the case (plastic? leather?) seems like it will easily rip in no time. Nylon fabric would seem more durable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this book or not from the cover description but took a chance on it, and am I glad that I did.  The characters were wonderfully developed and although I had part of the plot figured out, I was continually surprised by the twists and turns.  If all of Ms. Hoover's books are as good as this, she has a new member of her fan club
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I've been playing this album non-stop ever since I purchased it. I enjoy the music, I enjoy the lyrics and the general message of the songs. Good stuff. :)
030759565X|5.0|Everything I've ever made from Smitten Kitchen's blog has turned out awesome, so I have complete faith in the recipes. There is a lot more to this book though - it is SUCH a fun read! Deb is really witty and gives lots of information about each recipe and lots of little stories about how they came to be. If you are looking for a book with only recipes, I would stick to the blog, where you have a lot more options and can just skip the story, but you're definitely missing out. The blog stood out to me because I found that I remembered her stories, and consequently, her recipes, so this book is a great addition to my collection.
1616550414|5.0|Must have for any Zelda fan.  Contains the entire history of Zelda with large pages of beautiful artwork throughout! :)
B007URVZJ6|5.0|A great collection of ideas for publish with Kindle. A good step by step pane it laied out for you.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I this game is  drudgery or expensive. Sometimes at the same time. My 6 year old loves it. I don't.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|I enjoyed the A-Team when it was a TV series. So I was wondering how the movie would compare. In my opinion they did a great job! I really enjoyed the plot, action scenes, and actor's performances. Top notch!
B0036RCVJW|4.0|Henning writes well, and with a degree of passion.  I have read two of this authorz books and theymaybe a little formulaic - but still vibrant, and keep interest and suspense at a high level.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|All Floyd is excellent, this was their big one back in the day. Pink Floyd is the best of all times.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|What a charming movie with a divine scenery, the atmosphere of pure decadence of 1930 Italy, a good mix of naiveté and sophistication and a heart warming romance .<br />If you want a perfect escapist's movie, look no further.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|While the effects have gotten better over time, the plot has become tired. It's no longer about the walkers, it's about a puny feud going on between two human factions. The zombies have become little more than a nuisance that all the characters swat away like mosquitoes. They need to get Rick and the gang out of that stupid prison and have them start an epic journey where we can see how the rest of the country is affected by the plague.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Fantastic book. Practical advice and entertaining to read. Mark's energy is felt while reading.  Quick, easy and good for anyone in business.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best Tv series I've seen in a long time, love Maggie Smith and Brendan Coyle (Bates) riveting period drama, plan to watch it again.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Awesome product and great price! Helps improve your steady shots especially lower to the ground. I use it with my DSLR and GoPro cameras
B000H4TX9I|2.0|I really like sci fi, but this was pretty boring.  On the one hand they had women as warriors, then<br />a prostitute.  The director must like women's upper backs because there was a lot of time spent on showing<br />those.<br />I might try watching another but not for a long time.  It was free with my Prime membership and that was the best thing.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|This is a classic. You can't go wrong. Jean Luc and the gang never disappoint as they travel to distant planets.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really addicting! Fun game over all, I'd say the only, and I mean only, problem this game has is downloading the updates.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Such a great movie. I went to every store I could to buy it, but to no avail. Nobody had it. I was so happy (jumping up and down with a smile kind-of-happy) when I received it. Definitely one of my favorite musical films.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easily one of the best apps out there.... 2 thumbs up :)<br />I found the app very easy to use and it made navigation on ebay easier.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is mesmerizing.  All the actors are fabulous and the chemistry is amazing.  I highly recommend this to everyone.
B00005V1Y0|1.0|this is crazy and stupid and a waste of time, I would not recommend it to anyone, save your money!!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I couldn't get enough! Now that I watched the entire season in a week I can't wait until season 5 is out on blu-ray!
B00136JS12|5.0|I had this album in high school and wore it out. So happy to have the digital version now. Ready to crank it up!
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather keeps me current on all my weather questions.  It is very helpful with planning activities outdoors.  I would reccommend it to everyone wanting free yet accurate weather info.
0307730697|5.0|The story of the battle in which Adam Brown perished is just a very small part of this book. This book is about a man and patriot that despite his personal shortcomings and obstacles found a way to overcome them despite what statistics say may happen. When one has faith in God and himself anything is possible and Adam Brown is the epitome of that.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|A simple way to spend 8 minutes at a time. The cube is &#34;really cool&#34; as you rotate it around and look for matches.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|Listening to this album gives me fanboy moments. Never really thought that Jesse would return to the band. I love both him and Howard, so i was really happy with this. The choruses are brilliant.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the game. It's easy enough for my son to enjoy but still challenging enough to keep my attention. Great game for all
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Dave Grohl has got to be the most likeable guy in music & you watch him meet his heroes while working on telling the story of Sound City & the Neve board.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Do you know someone with Alzheimer's? Do you have a family history with this disease?  I can answer Yes to both questions, which is why this book was especially meaningful for me.  My father is in the early stages of late onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Reading this book helped me understand what he is currently experiencing and to anticipate what he'll experience as the disease progresses.  When I visited my father a few weeks ago, I found I was much more compassionate than I would have been if I hadn't read the book.  The author, who doesn't have AD, has experience working with people who do.  The book is written from the perspective of a 50 year old woman who is diagnosed with early onset AD.  You get to see and feel the symptoms from her perspective.  I highly recommend this book.  If you don't know someone with AD now, you probably will.  I've been reading there will be an epidemic of AD as the baby boomers enter their late 70s.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|The movie has an interesting plot turns and twists. Great dialogue, great surfing scenes. I would watch this movie again.
B005COO1X6|5.0|If you are like me and can't get enough Steven King then you must read this one! It's a quick fix!
B006ISJQ3K|5.0|How many similiar versions can one milk? I do enjoy ms diana ross live whenever i get the chance. Carry on Boss!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is a great story that manages to mix elements of many fairy tales with drama and just the right amount of comedy - good family entertainment.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|I saw this at a theater and immediately got a flashback to the first time I went to a Cirque du Soleil show. Amazing! Tears of joy came to me with one of the biggest smiles I've ever had in my life. Cirque du Soleil really takes you far away with their unique storytelling, make-up and costumes on each of their shows. It's unevitable.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is a dark, complex story that contains graphic violence and sexual content. Not for the faint of heart or suitable for children.<br />However, having said that, I think this is one of the best series ever! The plot(s) develop slowly due to the complexity and intertwining of the events and family histories that drive the main characters' actions.<br />as soon as I finished Season 1 I immediately watched Season 2 (nearly back to back for the episodes).<br />Season 2 is even better than Season 1.<br />Unfortunately, Amazon is still not offering Season 3 as of this writing.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Based on info I've read this was very close to reality.  The base story wasn't changed much, but I thought it gave us a good idea of what happened.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Arrived faster than expected, the knife is the best quality knife i've bought so far. Going to get plenty of use out of this bad boy. Sheath a bit rough at first, and I wish the writing on it was engraved like the first generation but oh well, cant get it all.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|...About our interactions and opening ourselves up to new experiences. I was reluctant at first to view it but it was worth it.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone that likes a suspense thriller that also has excellent character development (family relationships/dynamics). If you have read any other Gillian Flynn books and enjoyed it, this one is excellent as well!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I enjoyed how it focused on a very specific period in Lincoln's presidency and gave us a glimpse into his marriage.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I love love love this movie and the bonus short film paperman i am 28 and an animation student. The Bluray is cool showing behind the scenes at Disney
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is highly addictive and I would recommend you to get it because it's entertaining if you ever get bored or you don't like your other games.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book is not a good read.  I've never read about two more disturbing people and the ending is one of the worst endings ever.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I thought it was going to be not fun but once I played I seriously loved it so much you should play it ;)
B007MS5B6Q|4.0|Nada de castellano y restingido a zona a. Imprescindible si eres fan de The walking dead. Viene con un bonito Digipack para customizar con la edición patria.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book also but probably not as much as the other two.  It did keep me wanting to read more to learn what would happen next.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Un gran producto a un inmejorable precio, calidad de imagen y sonido. Además con perfecto castellano. Sin la franja azul del blu ray.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Overall this was a good book. It was well written, but I didn't care for the vulgar language. It would have been just as good without it.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Our reality is an out-picturing of our mind! Yes, we've read it and heard it but now we get to perform real-time research in the most influential law of nature. I'm grateful to Pam Grout for packaging this high-grade knowledge in one of the most accessible ways I've ever read. I teach meditation and I'm recommending this book to all of my students as the perfect supplement to their meditation practice. I loved the experiments and I've been talking about the book ever since I finished it. Thanks Pam for your wonderful work and I'm sending you thoughts for much success! If everyone read this book the world would be a much different place.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Gives me instant info I am looking for and info for family members across the country. Also like the advance forecast.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Love trips to the Other Side.  Looking foward to it myself when my turn comes.  Really like it when someone like the author get a taste and survives to tell about it....and he's a member of traditional medicine.  Great experience for all of us....his journey can bring insight to your own...thank you for sharing
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Really well done, great production values, great writing, great acting. Only negative is sometimes the thick british accents makes the dialog hard to understand for those not used to hearing it. Turning on closed captioning solves this minor issue.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I have tried to install this game on my Kindle Fire at least 6 times to no avail.  Good thing it was a freebie, but it still is aggravating.
B00AJLHUA8|1.0|Well, another haunted house thriller went down the tubes.<br />The previews are always the best thing. I loved it when Ethan Hawke saw a cardboard box and suddenly it opens and out slithers a little child. Wow!<br />But after sitting back to watch \\"Sinister\\" I gradually sensed this was going to be a total bomb.<br />For one thing, the movie is filmed so darkly I had to keep stopping it to replay a scene that I couldn't make out. After awhile, I just ignored it because I saw that our hero, Ethan Hawke, has this habit of roaming around this house haunted house with the weakest flashlight devised by Thomas Alva Edison.<br />The rooms were equipped with light switches but our hero appeared to have an aversion to overhead light. Perhaps the movie company couldn't afford overhead lightning.<br />Then we see the ghosts of the murdered kids.<br />They all wear Mummy make-up and clench their teeth and glower. What is their purpose? I've seen scarier ghosts on the Sy-Fy Channel.<br />While Ethan roams the house, he keeps leaping into the air from horror as something crashes around him. This poor guy needed a watch dog to keep him company.<br />And then there's supposed to be the big scare scene where all five dead kids form a group in the hallway but they always jump into another room when Ethan looks back.<br />We have of course the whiny, befuddled wife and the big question that perhaps others have been screaming; Why do you refuse to leave this haunted house?<br />When I think of all the \\"haunted house\\" movies where the actors never think of moving out of, the biggest one is the house in \\"Poltergeist,\\" \\"The Amityville Horror\\" and then \\"The Haunting of HIll House\\" and \\"The Haunting\\" and...and...<br />but if movie characters in bad movies  started acting like they had common sense, we wouldn't have bombs like \\"Sinister.\\"
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This novel surprised me. The characters were fully realized and the story was cohesive. The pacing was a bit frantic but in line with the character studies. The internal dialogue was very specific but I found myself understanding the shades of doubt described as very believable. Worth the read!

B006ISJQ3K|5.0|The 1976 gem, dubbed \\"The Black Album\\" by fans, has been lovingly remastered & repackaged for a new generation to discover the magic of Diana Ross.  Featuring two #1 Pop hits with \\"Do You Know Where You're Going To?\\" and \\"Love Hangover\\", the original release also included the obscured Michael Masser-produced gems \\"After You\\" and \\"I Thought It Took A Little Time (But Today I Fell In Love)\\", the funky \\"You're Good My Child\\" and \\"One Love In My Lifetime\\" (which showcased Ross in a setting not familiar to casual Ross fans), and a stirring reading of the classic \\"Smile\\", written by Charlie Chaplin and serving as a template for Michael Jackson's version almost twenty years later.  This reissue's first disc includes single versions of many of her songs from this and other albums, including \\"To Love Again\\" (one of Diana's all-time greatest ballad vocals), this time out with an excellent spoken intro IN FRENCH), and her self-produced cover of Elton John's \\"Harmony\\", a rare Coca Cola commercial entitled \\"Coming Home\\" that touches a nerve with troops coming home from Vietnam), and her masterful self-produced cover of Donny Hathaway's evergreen \\"This Christmas\\".  Disc 2 features alternate versions of the entire album, other alternate versions of iconic recordings, and promotional radio interview with Ross that hasn't been heard since 1976.<br /><br />The diversity of this album is startling as its cover art, featuring wonderful ballads, hard driving dance tracks, funky R & B and classic pop, and served both as a reminder of Ross' versatility and a template for Whitney Houston's first two albums a decade later.  A must for any Ross fan, any 1970s pop music fan, or anyone who wants a great introduction to solo Ross.

Highly recommended to anyone who has ever thought of starting a business.

B00BBW16HW|5.0|Funny, sad, optimistic.  All in one movie.  The story beautifully captures the spirit of a man who lives through his quadriplegic ordeal.  Should have been a nominee for Oscar as best film or best foreign film.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|True to the Roddenberry legacy - this series is pure entertainment.  Strong characters, entertaining stories and an interesting view of our future make the series enjoyable.
034580404X|5.0|Great books,  Especially 1 & 2.  3 got a little, eh boring....  But I would surely get the next book if one comes out.  Leaves us all longing for a lil Christian Grey.

B005HEJ2DK|5.0|This season is an extremely cohesive number of shows that maintain the plot line from beginning to end.  One of the greatest seasons of all the Star Trek series, in my opinion.
