0385349947|4.0|I love how this book challenges me to look at my own actions in social contexts.  I like how it challenges me to think critically of my inner culture and the culture in the workforce in regards to women.  It is not an all encompassing answer to the problems women face in the workforce, but it is a fantastic start to conversations leading to change for the better.  A must read for men in business and administration.
B004ULEEY8|3.0|I thought it had a lot of potential, but it turned out to be a simple war movie. The marines fault off a band of aliens who were no more resistant to bullets than any other human. Yeah, the city took a lot of damage, but I wasn't filled with anticipation about what was going to happen next. It was a little cliche' and predictable. Just another war movie.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I enjoy purchasing books online. Recently I purchased a book to learn a foreign language. This book included audio files to hear the language being spoken. Unfortunately, Kindle for Android does not play these files. I cannot give this app an excellent rating if it cannot support all my amazon purchases.
B002UZCJP2|4.0|I was pleased with this movie, but not surprised by it's plot or story line. It was set in the future, in a time when people depended on machines more than they did on themselves, to live the lives that only dreamed of. But as you know, not everybody liked that idea and so there was a rebellion. The movie had a couple of pretty good twists in the plot, where you think you know who're the good guys and who the bad ones, but that all changes towards the end. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll just say, its a pretty good scifi thriller and love story all in one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|If I love a product, it should be enough to give it five stars. So I love the product, hate the review system. No more rating from me!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I was not sure I would like this app, but when I start getting stressed this is the go to app for me. Looking at wonderful photos and being able to pin them easily makes this a great app.
B0000714BP|5.0|Loved the movie and this one works fine.  The description was true and it arrived on time. I am always looking for hard to find movies and hopefully I will get more from this seller.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Received as expected.
1118109791|5.0|Great book, super comprehensive and covers all you need to know. The diagnostic test was very helpful. Extremely satisfied with my purchase.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|You are playing several gameboards at a time.  Helps with hand and eye coordination.  Levels get alittle more challeging as you move along
1609611543|5.0|this is exactly what I was looking for after seeing the Dr. Oz interview with William Davis. Very happy with my purchase.
B008AUGEFC|1.0|I gave this book one star.  If possible I would have given it -100 stars.  This by far is the worst book I've ever read in my entire life!!!  The only reason I finished reading it was because it was selected to be read as part of a book club that I am a member of.  After I started reading this piece of crap I went online to look at some reviews and 75% of the reviews were a 4 or 5 stars.  That is just crazy.  I would never ever recommend this book to anyone.  It is extremely hard to read.  Mitchell writes in such a way that you don't know what the heck he is saying.  The book is suppose to show how we are all connected but he does a terrible job at connecting each of the chapters.  He basically has 6 different stories that don't relate to one another in any meaningful way.  I wish I never read this book.
B00BB8VRPM|1.0|NOT in English. This has English sub titles.<br /><br />I did not see that it was English sub titles or I would not have rented it. I have seen it in English so I do know its available.  Not happy that I can't find the English version on amazon.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Worse than the &#34;Lost&#34; journey in the end. Do enjoy the ride - its all you have - though even the ride become pretty pale and lifeless in this volume.<br />The repetitions and the author's endless joy that &#34;breakfast&#34; comes from &#34;breaking your fast&#34; all starts to wear thin when there is no plot development - just meandering through the admittedly interesting world he has created.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|First i was hesitant to get this going by the samples I heard but i decided to purchase it well because it's Depeche Mode one of my top 5 bands and yes it does require a couple of listens and then it really grows on you, LOVE this album especially The Child inside,Should be higher,soft touch/raw nerve.
B00CHVIPP2|3.0|The Croods is a family based animation film which does a fairly decent job in giving likable personalities to it's characters. None of the work was ground-breaking but the story has this very good loop to it, it seemed the film-maker never allowed a lull moment. The kids at the theater were enjoying themselves and so were the mothers. My girlfriend wanted to watch it this and nothing else was on.<br /><br />Watch the trailer before watching this.<br />The 3D was decent, nothing ground-breaking.<br /><br />I prefer animation films like \\"Wall E\\" , \\"Up\\" and \\"Mary & Max\\" more.<br /><br />The Croods isn't bad but for a person in their late 20's it can be a bit too nice.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|It is a really good game I just wish it had for levels!!! So fun. I play it all the time!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Some really innovative arrangements of songs from different genres. That being said I would like to see the CDs themed a bit more - i.e., the collection is quite eclectic and lacks some continuity. Overall I love the Piano Guys :)
0143118757|5.0|This is a great book - It's about fairness, research, really understanding the other side (getting to the bottom of what they really want and why) and avoiding positional bargaining. It contains good points on preparing for a negotiation as well as how to understand the process and separate people from the actual problem (and from emotions). It's a great mix of theory and real-life examples and it's really easy to read. It helped me with daily negotiations at work and at home. I will definitely re-read it in a while just to remind myself of the techniques.
1451648537|5.0|I bought this book on a pre-sale, so paid very nearly the maximum.  But that's what happens when an item is wildly popular and you want to be sure you get your copy!  I received this book as soon as it was possible to get it, and it was in perfect condition.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, too.  Good value, good service.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Funny, entertaining, interesting, catchs all time your attention, love Katniss, Peta and all of the characters..., great non-stop-reading novel!! Exactley what I want in order to have a good time!!

B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love this game so much that I have erased and reloaded it over 5 times. I hope they come out with more games like this because the iPad has over 10 dash games.
1401924751|5.0|I have several card sets,  and this one is absolutely beautiful,  very well done!  Easy to use,  easy to understand,  and has a rich, soothing energy about it.  A LOVELY set.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I truely liked this book and it is both amazing and wonderful, - it might though have been not quite so long, that is the sole reason for four stars instead of five:)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Logic twisting, can't wait for the next room. Game play is addictive, brain taxing and extremely fun. GREAT GAME Fireproof Games keep up the good work.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I liked this book a lot, so real and understanding in so many ways, though there might be a little too much sport for me;-)
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|graphics are actually overclocked with the processor too.  Aren't bad graphics for simple games.  I can simultaneously  play Civ 5 and Video Edit HD footage on two screens---- easy overclock
1452115567|5.0|As an avid dog lover I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I was so excited to find out they were developing a book and I hope there is more to come.  I even purchased a 2nd copy as a gift for my Mom.  Maddie is precious!
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|The purchase of this CD replaces my vinyl album and allowed me to upload it to my iPod.  I prefer to purchase fantastic albums in case the files become corrupt or don't transfer well.  This album is a must have for anyone that enjoys music from the late 70s early 80s.  It's a double album and you'll simply love every song.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy playing as a stress reliver. You know that helps get you through the day and relive your stress level at the same time. Always like to try and beat my old score but it is no biggy if I don't. So I play!

B009AMANH4|5.0|Great film-deserved the academy award. Beautiful Blu-ray DVD. The materials in the two disc Blu Ray pack were well done.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Nice game, but intrusive ads kind of suck some of the fun out... the family a big fan otherwise. Blah blah blah

B00BP4WAZS|4.0|This movie is great for anyone fond of video games and related popular culture from the 80s and 90s. It, like many other Disney Pixar movies, incorporates great, clean humor and good characters. Enjoy!
0385344228|4.0|This well-written, suspenseful novel represents the confluence of several genres. First, it's a story of a family that is challenged by a life-altering event that affects not only the husband/wife relationship but also their relationship with their teenage son. Secondly, it presents a compelling courtroom drama that is truly a page turner. Thirdly, it is a story that makes use of the author's obvious knowledge of the law and prosecutorial and police procedures. Taken together, this provides an exceptional reading experience. We come to care deeply about these people and want to learn the truth about their lives.
0470503696|5.0|I've used this book constantly, both as an instructional manual and as a handy reference guide.  It's a great way to start learning VBA!
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Based on the title, I expected the movie to focus on the attack on OBL's compound in Allahabad.  Instead, the attack occupied only the last 30 minutes or so of the movie.  No mention was made of the intense preparation by the SEALs prior to the operation.  A more realistic, descriptive title would have been \\"The Hunt for Bin Laden.\\"<br />I had major challenges with the depiction of CIA personnel.  During my 30-year Army career as a field artilleryman, I spent 12 years overseas including a combat tour in Vietnam and tours of duty as dense attaché in Dhaka, Bangladesh, as a lieutenant colonel and later as a colonel in New Delhi.  In both attaché assignments, I had close professional and personal relationships with the station chiefs and case officers.  These selfless Americans were generally much better mannered than the characters portrayed in the movie.  I found the profane language excessive and unrealistic.  I am not a prude, and I realize that during times of duress, folks resort to foul language that they would not necessary use on a routine basis.  But, I felt that the overuse of the F-bomb was uncalled for and did not depict how intelligence professionals actually conduct themselves.  The CIA officer in charge of the \\"enhanced\\" interrogation came across as unprofessional and somewhat cowboyish.<br />While the defense attaché in New Delhi, I worked with members of JSOC during a prolonged hostage situation in Kashmir in 1995.  I also knew several SEALs who had left active duty and were working with for another government agency. All of these outstanding young Americans were world-class athletes, generally quiet, reflective, and totally committed to mission accomplishment.  The movie was entertaining, but I wish it had been more true to its title in order to truly recognize the achievements of these great warriors.
1416549447|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it!  He's actually used some of the techniques in his running and said that he's seen immediate improvements!
B000002J03|5.0|I used to have this in 8 track when it first came out. I have always loved the classic Zep sound. You can't find Heartbreaker and Livin Lovin any where else!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I must preface my review by saying that I am a total Tolkien nerd, have read all of the books in the series (including the Silmarillion) more than a dozen times.  This movie follows the book close enough to please loyal fans, but adds enough to the story to make it a surprise for those same people.<br /><br />The disc arrived in excellent condition and on time.  Very pleased!
B004LP3AYI|2.0|Unfortunately the kindle version contains so many errors that it detracts from the story. I don't know how the publisher could have let this pass for acceptable.  Clearly someone was asleep at their desk. Or more likely on holiday somewhere, because just a cursory read would've revealed the mistakes.  Still, if you are willing to fill in the blanks and replace words in your head as you go along, it is still coherent.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I'm only halfway through the book, but I have not been disappointed.  It's sad that Robert Jordan didn't live to see the end of his fantasy epic, but Brandon Sanderson has done a remarkable job continuing his legacy.  A must-read for any fantasy fan!
B008Y5OW20|2.0|I really wanted to like Jeff Lynne's album, Long Wave.  Alas, the album is proof that just because you can play all of the instruments it is not necessarily a good idea.  Lynne is famous as the rock genius behind Electric Light Orchestra.  He was the production brains behind the semi-serious supergroup Traveling Wilburys.  Perhaps he should have saved some of that brilliance for Long Wave.<br /><br />The premise behind Long Wave is to take eleven standards or early-rock-era songs and give them the ELO touch.  I like the songs and, decades ago I liked the ELO sound, but after 27 minutes (no kidding, a 27 minute CD) the listener wonders why Lynne bothered.  The charts are predictable.  Several tracks sound as if Lynne couldn't think of a way to end the arrangement.  Some tracks beg for an instrumental bridge, but to no avail.<br /><br />All in all, it is just a disappointment that such a talented guy could come up with such an ordinary outing.  As I said, I really wanted to like this album but Jeff Lynne will have to try harder to get my money next time.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|We have the previous ones, and this one is also excellently done.  Can't stop playing if  for the beautiful music.

B002U5HKZ6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It took me 100 pages to get hooked, and then I couldn't fight it. I loved most of the characters, even if the names began blurring together for me in the flurry of introductions in the last third of the book. Highly entertaining, and I dare say educational. I felt like I was in Bombay at moments, and the author made me love it as much as he clearly does. The section of the book dedicated to Afghanistan was surprisingly tedious to me. I only gave it four stars because I do think a meaner editor could have made this a leaner novel, and a few parts dragged. I understand a few reviewers' complaints about how sometimes Linbaba is an implausibly adept hero, having the perfect skills and unbelievable comedic timing for any situation, but I forgive the author because of how well he described everything from settings to moods to conversations and body language. I was left breathless multiple times and was moved to tears at others. I would love to see this book turned into a movie if only to expose it to a wider audience. I highly recommend this book. One of the best novels I've read in the last ten years.
B005LAIHCM|2.0|I watched the uncut version, which said it contained a \\"shocking twist,\\" but I didn't see any twist. The uncut version was 3 minutes longer than the theatrical version, but where was the twist?<br /><br />The House at the End of the Street belonged to Carrie Ann's parents. Carrie Ann is a young girl with very large legs (and arms) and long hair hanging in her face. She gets out of bed one night and kills her parents. Then, the story goes, she is drowned in a dam, but her body isn't found.<br /><br />Teenage Elissa and her (divorced?) mother Sarah move into a rent house close to the murder house. They can afford the rent due to the murder. Neighbors complain that the house brings down their property value.<br /><br />Sarah is perhaps a radiological technician (she's always looking at xrays) at her job at the hospital. She seems to always work the night shift, leaving Elissa alone in the huge house with big windows that have no coverings.<br /><br />After leaving a party one night, Elissa meets Ryan, who it turns out is Carrie Ann's brother, who was sent away (why?) to live with an old aunt. After his parents were killed, he came back to the house to fix it up and sell it. He's a bit quiet and nervous, but Elissa finds him intriguing (since all the other guys at her school are jerks). However, her mother gets a weird vibe off Ryan. But Elissa is fed up with mother due to her prior bad acts (not sure exactly what those were).<br /><br />The cop at the hospital (apparently the only cop in town, and he's always at the hospital, doing security guard duty, but he can leave any time he wants to), tells Sarah that Ryan was living with the old aunt and taking care of her. She had a stroke, and when his parents died, he moved back to the house with his aunt. She then died a year ago. So did anyone see the aunt?<br /><br />However, Ryan tells Elissa that his aunt died and THEN he moved back to the house. He says he inherited the house and has enough money to pay the bills, etc. Doesn't go into any of the probate stuff about how he had to prove his sister was dead to be the only heir.<br /><br />Turns out Ryan is keeping a big secret. Carrie Ann is really alive, and he has her locked up in a room, below the basement. Yes, there is another basement below the basement. There is a bed, and a sink. She doesn't care to be locked up, and usually escapes, with her long hair hanging in her face, her trusty butcher knife in hand.  At one point, she runs off with some amazingly ugly moccasin-type houseshoes on her feet, below those very large legs. Que feo.<br /><br />When Carrie Ann gets riled up, Ryan gives her a shot of something, that calms her right down. And every time, when he gets finished giving her the shot, he throws the syringe.  Where does he get these drugs and syringes?<br /><br />The rest of the film is the predictable last-minute rush to save the victim, etc. Elissa has apparently not paid attention to any scary movie. You know, when you think the killer is dead, but they  never are? That isn't scary any more.<br /><br />SPOILERS: I have some questions.  His mother was on illegal drugs. Carrie Ann dies in a swing accident. His father buries her. Why? If they were afraid of calling the police to the house, why didn't they just take her to the hospital? Just to make sure she's dead? Since they loved her so much, that they made their son take on her personality, and made him into a girl - wouldn't they want to see if MAYBE something could be done for her? Why did they prefer Carrie Ann over Ryan? Why did they BOTH go for this ridiculous idea? How could they not see that this denial of his identity was driving Ryan so insane that he was grunting and screaming and had his hair hanging in his face, and was a whole lot of trouble to try to control? And very dangerous to them?(Ryan told Elissa that brain-damage made Carrie Ann \\"aggressive\\" - so he did have some self-insight.) Was it really worth it to make their living son into their dead daughter?<br /><br />Also, was he home-schooled or what? How did he go from being crazy, murderous Carrie Ann, to \\"normal\\" Ryan? Why did he want to replace Carrie Ann, when he'd been forced to BE Carrie Ann for so many years?<br /><br />And why was the cop so creepy and suspicious-appearing, as though he were a bad guy?<br /><br />Lots of psychological background was left out. To give some explanation would have made this a better movie.<br /><br />Edit: Well, I looked up to find out what the twist was, and it wasn't on my uncut version. The cop was taking drugs with the parents and the father told him he'd have to go along with it (after he'd buried Carrie Ann). Still don't get why they couldn't say Carrie Ann died, and why Ryan had to be turned into Carrie Ann.aughter?<br /><br />Also, was he home-schooled or what?

0544002318|5.0|Scott has my most respect!! I do wish there was a little more details, regarding diet & training. Overall it was a good read, and has peak my interest in getting my running miles back up.
B009PF93LS|5.0|After having to send the first one back,(it skipped on one track), my daughter loves this cd.  during the holidays, it was the only one she wanted to listen too.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|To be honest I saw the movie first and loved it!!!! Soon after I was in need of a book fix and saw the cover on Amazon. I figured if the movie was great then the book should be great too. The book and the move are very different and I loved that. You get to go deeper into what is happening to Pat in the book and understand what's going on in his head. Overall it was a good read.
B002W1UEW4|2.0|it was very cheesy, at this point in the movie industry i expected better. oh well, hopefully the new one is better.
B00BHMF578|3.0|I was kind of disappointed by Argo.  I know it was based on real-life events, but I didn't find it very suspenseful.  The plot is believable but just not very exciting.  I also feel like I have seen this movie in other forms before.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I truely enjoy this show even though at times i'm shaking my head thinking why don't you girls seek help from an outside source or letting your parents onto what's going on!! I duno just wished they actually had someone who could help them end this craziness or for them to tell the truth on what happened that night!!!! BUT i would lose a great show to watch and i just can't have that happen since there really isn't too much on! I can't wait to own season 3 or to actually see season 4!!!
B00BSBY38A|3.0|The movie gives you a quirky, curve ball at the end, that if you think about what was said, and what you watched, left you a tad empty.
B000H30B2C|4.0|I am a big fan of the Original King Kong and I enjoyed Peter Jackson's remake. But I prefer the theatrical version over this extended version. I feel that it is a bit too long and can only reccomend watching it to the hardcore fan (and then only if you are curious). For repeated viewings I prefer the Theatrical version.....But I can reccomend getting this set for the extensive bonus features (which do not appear on the theatrical two disc set)...If you are into behind the scenes detail, you will LOVE this. This set goes into exauhstive detail on the making of the film and even goes into the details of Jackson's Pre Lord of The Rings attempt to remake King Kong (that never saw the light of the day). it's all just tremendously engrossing. Theres also a very funny little short film that was made by the cast and crew (as a special birthday gift to Peter Jackson) entitled \\"The Gift\\".<br /><br />So in summary: If you are a fan of King Kong and liked Peter Jackson's remake I can reccomend getting this 3 disc set for the bonus features alone and the extended cut only as a curiosity. I own this set along with the theatrical version (along with the original 1933 version) and I am happy to have all three.
0385535147|2.0|That I did not like a Grisham book.  1-very small and lightly printed.  Was difficult for me.  Perhaps, others will like it fine.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter, she loved it! I think this was the best movie I have ever seen.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really fun it feels like I am taking care of a real live horse.  However they need to explain how and where to find the goal they want you to complete.  : )
0679805273|5.0|Dr. Suess is the best and these books are a hit for client gifts.  They came on time and are a classic.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|great film. Denzel never dissapoints. The story point certainly makes you think pilots are just as human and make mistakes, but darn, would I put my life or my family's life on their hands. probably not. Would hope for more stringent regulations prior to a pilot getting in the cockpit.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The only thing that could make it better is more information about the point of the game--an explanation of the special coins, what's the deal with the puzzle pieces, is there a goal of some sort?
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great movie, good story line and good acting, but I don't think it was Oscar worthy.. perhaps I'd expected more. The tension build up is great throughout the film. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are fantastic!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Reading this book will have you checking the history books to see if any of this could actually have happened.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Well written to document a most interesting and successful life. Steve Job has a significant impact in today's technology. Great read
0143113100|5.0|quite possibly has made the jump to the top of my favorite books list. A book that is well written along with being based on a topic which will make you want to change our life, some reads don;t get better than that. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
0316776963|1.0|Not a very good book. Just dragged on and on. Was hoping for so much more. Save your money. Was hoping for something like \\"running with scissors\\"
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The packaging design is good<br />The bonus content of second part sneak peak is superb<br />The content of the film itself is epic<br />Recommended!
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|The movie was really good.  But I couldn't get the HD version to play on my system due to the limitations of my DSL speed (1.3 Mbps maximum - amazon requires 2Mbps minimum).  Had to watch the SD version on my PC.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Love this app I can listen to music all day at work without any problem also watch videos that very funny thank you for this app
B007W1BLN0|5.0|I read the book and LOVED it.<br />The film captures another part of this amazing tale.<br />Well acted. Well scripted. Well directed.<br />The photography is beautiful.<br />You don't return the same after watching.
0307266303|5.0|The way you look at running will never be the same again. Every runner should read this! Read it twice already, and will read it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'd say to anybody that is like me get it now and rate it now!!! I love it!!! Great game!!!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|***UPDATE (60% in)***<br />60% in and it's getting worse.  It got better for a chapter or two, but now, it's really sad.  I just read the Jaimie chapter that seems to have been included just so people wouldn't go through Jaime withdrawal.  I'd say that something relatively major happens in only one of 5 chapters, at best.  For most of the chapters it's blah, blah, followed by more blah, then a sentance or two at the end that basically serves as \\"the thing that happened in the chapter\\".  I don't need to read 10 pages about what Mellisandre is thinking or feeling.  It bears little to no relevance to the story. And if I wanted to read detailed sex scenes I'd buy Penthouse Letters. This book is such a let down.  I literally skip pages in this book to avoid drawn out descriptions on the type of food they were eating, or the history of meaningless houses.<br /><br />If you're reading this book, it's likely because you are committed to the series.  If so, you're likely going to read it regardless.  That said, don't feel guilty if you skip a page.  Or two.  Or ten.<br />******<br /><br />It's really sad that it has come to this.  Similar to other readers, the first three books had me on the edge of my seat, sneaking in reading sessions when no one was looking, etc.  Everything started going downhill in book 4.  In the first three books, it felt like something major/storyline-changing happened literally every chapter.  It's been a little while since I read book 4 (maybe 6 months?), but I can barely remember 3 major things occurring the entire book!  It felt like someone told the author \\"ok, in order to count for anything in the world of fantasy novels, your series must contain 7 books\\".  It was an exercise in patience to finish book 4 and now, only a couple chapters into book 5, I feel like my only motivation for reading any more of this series is to learn what happens to the remaining characters.  In fact, if I were rating this book strictly on its level of quality, and notas a continuation of a series, I'd give it a 2.<br /><br />(Slightly) Epic Fail!!!!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great story tied in with history.  I purchased the second in the trilogy when I was only part wat through this first one.
B00BHMF578|5.0|i like  ben affleck films,and while i may be in the minority,most of his films  are enjoyable to me..this is a riveting drama that is surprisingly good in spite of knowing the ending.. it's like watching a shakespeare play for the actors interpretation...good movie
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|live this wonderful classic  as a child!  loved it even more reading along with the narration by  Anne  was spectacularly Oz-riffic !
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|no human is all hero or all villian...denzel can be both at the same time...excellent actor...average film;good ending...not an action flic..if you love drama.this one is for denzel fans
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It is versatile and meets my every need for an alarm. It is conveniently on my kindle fire which is kept by my bedside daily.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|not for the weak of heart or politically correct...an action film based on a  period of history filled with controversy and passions that still permeate our society...violent fantasy based on violent history

B00BTYP6QE|1.0|i down loaded this game for my son but there are not instructions in how to go to the next level so he always has a hard time to play it. i do not recommend this game at all!
B005J2V74C|3.0|It is a good scary movie, it does not have  very good special effects, goog theme and goog shooting location
0449806901|5.0|These books keep you interested all the way through.  They involve realistic situations and justice by realistic characters. I will read or listen to them all.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|Contains ALL songs from 2012 movie. Don't be misled by the \\"Highlight\\" CD, it only contains a portion of the songs.  This soundtrack brought back every scene of the wonderful adaptation of Victor Hugo's monumental work \\"Les Miserables\\".  What is truly amazing is that after all these years we are treated to Russell Crowe's interpretation of Javert.  Didn't realize he could sing! Of course, he is nowhere as talented in vocal blessings as the multi-dimensional Hugh Jackman, but none the less he added depth and anguish to the soundtrack. Definitely would purchase again, although I probably would buy the CD instead downloading the music.  What is missing is the liner notes on each CD which is missing if you download the musical score only.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|I was so sleepy and tired when my husband put this in to watch, I didn't think I'd see the end but it kept me going for the entire movie.  Very good!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Haven't seen the movie, but this story is heart-wrenching and funny at the same time. A perfect story about love, loss, and absolutely finding oneself and starting over.
0307750922|5.0|I find I am totally adicted to the Jack Reacher character.  Keep going, Lee Child. I will read or listen to everything you've got.
B002JI94J4|5.0|\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" was written by Alun Owen, and directed by Richard Lester. It was released in 1964, at the height of Beatlemania.  The documentary-style film chronicles the Beatles arriving at a theater, rehearsing, and performing in a BBC television special. At one point, the Beatles hold a press conference. Reporter: \\"How did you find America?\\" John: \\"Turn left at Greenland.\\" Reporter: \\"Are you a mod or a rocker?\\" Ringo: \\"I'm a mocker.\\" Reporter: \\"What would you call that hairstyle you're wearing?\\" George: \\"Arthur.\\" Reporter: \\"Do you often see your father?\\" Paul: \\"No, actually, we're just good friends.\\" Musically speaking, Ringo may have been overshadowed by John, Paul and George. In this movie, once Ringo steps out from behind his drum kit, he steals the show from the other Beatles!  No film evokes memories of my childhood as much as this movie does.  I vividly recall sitting in a movie theater, and listening to girls my age screaming every time one of the Beatles was on-screen.  The video quality of the Blu-ray version of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" was crystal clear, even seen by a misty-eyed, middle-aged man reliving his childhood!

B0034G4ORM|2.0|So some meteor showers are hitting various cities around the world, one of these cities is Los Angeles, soon after it becomes obvious the meteors aren't the usual flaming rocks from space as aliens start attacking from the shores and they infiltrate portions of the city. These attacks lay waste to many people, buildings and the military is called into action where Ssgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart, \\"The Dark Knight\\") leads his group in an effort to take back the city and destroy these aliens. I guess this was supposed to be moving to see people dying left and right but there was almost no depth to any of the characters introduced and a lot of the actors seemed to be going through the motions.<br /><br />The look of the aliens reminded me a lot of \\"District 9\\" which isn't a good thing in my opinion, the action sequences are pretty mundane and the explanation for why the aliens have invaded our planet is typical and expected. Movies like these are meant to be at the very least entertaining, unfortunately \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" comes across like a grittier but poorer \\"Independence Day\\" knock off without having any of that flicks charm. I've seen worse movies but this certainly isn't one to watch again and again. * 1/2 out of 4 stars.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Not really a western movie kinda person but this is a definite keeper. I watch it over and over again,
B002SJIO5E|2.0|(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />In the early 80's a big alien ship showed up above Johannesburg, South Africa, some aliens came from it and some 28 years later the camp that was set up has basically become the slums of the city called \\"District 9\\". The aliens nicknamed \\"Prawns\\" live in terrible conditions and a group called Multi-National United is called in to get rid of the prawns and remove them from these slums. The man in charge is Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley, \\"The A-Team\\") who really doesn't want to do this, he doesn't have any respect for any of the prawns as evidence by how he treats them when he forces his way into their homes to remove said aliens from said houses.<br /><br />Well soon after entering the home of a father and son alien household Wikus opens some canister and gets an alien chemical sprayed into his face (why he did such an idiotic act is beyond me), then soon after he begins slowly changing into a prawn. Once he gets outcast into the slums he has to befriend this father and son alien duo, to one try and find a cure, two help them fight back against the military that's ready to invade \\"District 9\\". In particular a vicious guy who wants to kill all prawns and targets Wikus in particular, which doesn't really lend anymore emotion to the story.<br /><br />The movie itself is one weird mix, part of it is straight sci-fi which actually is decently well done in a few parts, like when Wikus and the father alien break into a building, but other parts are just silly, the mech suit fight near the end comes to mind. The mock-u-mentary portion is just dumb, trying to present this as actual believable material was not the way to go and quite frankly brought this movie way down and devalued anything good it did. These portions also lended no emotional weight to the characters least of all Wikus who has to be one of the least likeable characters ever, it gets even worse when we're supposed to apparently care about him trying to avoid becoming a prawn and save the father and son (which he fails at, at first, I might add).<br /><br />I remember honestly being pretty angry while watching this, since it did have potential but was too jumbled and had no emotion behind it. Sure the whole refugee storyline with the aliens might echo some old war movies but those were done far, far better than \\"District 9\\". I can see why people like this flick which is more than fine, I just couldn't get into it and came really close to hating it. *1/2 out of 4 stars.and save the father and son (which he fails at, at first, I might add).<br /><br />I remember honestly being pretty angry while watching this, since it did have potential but was too jumbled and had no emotion behind it.

B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Saw part one at London Sundance and although a casual fan,was blown away.it didn't hurt that after the film henly,Frey,Walsh and Timothy did a q and a in white collar shirts and black jackets.I'm 64 and have seen 'em all,but the eagles are definately \\"an American band\\".can't wait to see the 77 tour blue ray.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|I had real hopes for this movie and had waited for a long time to watch it.  I was extremely dissappointed with the story line.  I was bored and ready for it to be over.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book...hated the ending. There were many twists and turns and I thought I had it figured out but I was wrong.  It was a good psychological in depth story about two dysfunctional people.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|After suffering through Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan (who made Dalton look good!) , it is refreshing to have a Bond that lives up to the character.  I'd put him second to Sean Connery.  Of his three Bond movies so far, I'd place this one second to Casino Royale.
B00BQHA0UQ|3.0|This is a good album if you're new to Carlos Vives, but having been a long time fan, this is more of the usual fanfare Carlos has produced in the past - nothing ground breaking here.<br /><br />The dance remix of Como Le Gusta A Tu Cuerpo is absolutely shocking.<br /><br />My two fave songs on this disc are song 7 Hoy Me Desperte En Otro Lugar and song 10 La Fantastica.<br /><br />I'll give this effort 'tres estrellas'.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book does remind me of fifty shades but there is more detail ans depth I can't wait for the third book
B005DJREGQ|4.0|It's nice to remember high school, this was a slap in the memory of all of it, from every perspective. This show is addicting and inspiring, well written and acted.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book had my emotions everywhere I was crying laughing falling in love with the character's cheering them on through there battles I loved this book that's why I gave it five stars.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|The 3 D was very good , just like when we saw it at the Movie Theater. Awesome movie for my grandson.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app, these people should keep going and upgrade this app because it's just fun and addicting in a good way.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I bought it for my grandson. The 3 D is amazing Worth the money. We have no problems with the 3 D.

B007WFR0QS|5.0|Emeli is a very talented artist and I rarely buy CDs anymore but it was very worth it! My favorite track is my kind of love.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Very excellent DVD.  Great acting.  Some of the scenes are not true to life, but, it the movies.  recommend this DVD to mature adults.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Well written, well acted and lots of fun.  The back-stabbing and wheeler-dealing of politics is all laid out beautifully.  The old series wasn't as sharply filmed, plus there were not subtitles, so the older ones of us will really appreciate the remastered version.  While British politics, you will recognize the same people as in the US!  The main character occasionally speaks to the audience - lovely touch and so much sarcasm and wit!  One of the BBCs best!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Meryl Strep never fails to take a part and make it her own. She is charming, funny, intelligent and bold.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|It's a quick read that seems really help the reader relate to the character. Only the last chapter about the algae seems a bit in sci-fi land
0345529057|5.0|Loved the HBO series. Decided I want to read the story to better understand all the characters and the country in which this story takes place.
B00AZRBLHO|3.0|Easy read, however, I kept feeling like I had read the book before.  It follows the same pattern as the book it frequently mentions, The Goal by Eli Goldratt.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Enjoyed this film. I am a Quinton Tarentino fan. This film is eccentric, unorthodox, and really a treat. It has a lot of violence. It keep me interested throughout the entire film.
0894803123|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book and made a few of the recipes.  The only criticism I have is that they authors don't tell the reader buy pasteurize eggs or how to cook a custard ice cream base on the stovetop.  I assume they made the conscious decision to eliminate the cooking step to make it more approachable, but if they were going to do that, I would have preferred that they made that clear up front and flagged the reader on the risk(s) of consuming raw eggs.<br /><br />As for the recipes,  I've made some and they're decent.  That said,  I think The Perfect Scoop by Lebovitz is a far superior book and if you only have room for one on your shelf,  I'd recommend that one instead.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I've tried several other cords for charging our Kindle Fires but the original one can't be beat. A little on the short side for our taste but it works flawlessly with the original Kindle chargers as well as a variety of other chargers. Can't go wrong with this one! Also great for file sharing with a PC.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Super good. I love the books even more than the movies!!! Such a fantastic book that keeps you on the edge.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|I love being able to watch new releases without having to take up more space collecting DVD's. It's so nice having Amazon instant video to buy/rent and store movies.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As expected, enjoyed catching up on the missed season. Some have complained of missing scenes, did not notice and lack of continuity.
0062059963|1.0|I was hoping that this book would be better than the first but was horribly disappointed.  The heroine is a whiny brat who can't figure out a single thing on her own, Maxon has the blandness of oatmeal, and even the king throwing a temper tantrum can't liven up the plot.  Despite America breaking more than one of the \\"rules\\" she gets to stay within the Elite.  Someone else breaks the rules?  Let's flog her half to death!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I'm such a big fan of Doctor Who, I found this on Amazon and at a great price too! Christopher Eccleson does a great job as the 9th Doctor! I'm also a big fan of Rose as his companion. This is a great series, if you had not watched it yet...DO! it is very addictive!
0345803493|5.0|The books were all very good, excellent read. I received the books in the mail extremely fast for regular shipping. Cant complain about much, except that theres no more books to read!
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Love heals all if you let it.  The real question is do people let love heal them.  Can people see true love in front of them and understand what love is.  This story is about how love can heal.  Love this movie, just made my top 10 love stories.
B002GJT4XM|5.0|I really enjoyed going through the whole box set and particularly loved watching the extended versions as well as the special features :)
B000FA675C|5.0|excellent.....well done!! Well written, well researched, Dan Brown keeps you i8nterested from page one until the end, a real hard book to put down.
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|I really enjoyed going through the whole box set and particularly loved watching the extended versions as well as the special features :)
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very challenging and addicting. Each puzzle keeps you wanting to improve your timing and gives your eyes the skill to looking faster to solve the puzzle.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I enjoyed this book and its namesake, Ender. Was this the inspiration for Starship Troopers? Who cares, where is the next chapter, I can't wait to see what happens next. Highly recommended, as if you needed me to tell you what so many have said before.
B0035LJY6C|5.0|I love this movie. The opening scene really sets the mood: a group or Christmas caroler being--well, Christmas-y. Enough to make me cringe (I thought I put in the Adams Family movie, not a Christmas one) until the camera pans up to show the Adams family on the roof, sinister expressions on their faces, ready to pour a cauldron of bubbling brew onto the pesky singers.<br /><br />Morticia's dead-pan acting adds humor to the scene: in one instance, Wednesday is trying to electrocute her brother, and Morticia gets mad at her not for electrocuting him, but for holding them up (they were supposed to be going somewhere). Morticia's romance with her husband is so over-the-top that it's funny, and of course the storyline with Uncle Fester is both captivating and poignant.<br /><br />A fun film!

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Django Unchained is a great movie. Seriously. For all the controversy this movie has, Quentin Tarantino managed to make a really fine western movie. Jamie Foxx was Excellent as Django. Leonardo Dicaprio was Brilliant as Calvin Candie the greedy slave owner. Though this was my first time seeing him in a film, Christoph Waltz did a terrific job as Dr Schultz. The most overlooked and more hilarious of all the characters was Samuel L Jackson as Stephen. Samuel L Jackson can tackle any role with style and he does a very memorable job playing Stephen. In my opinion all the main actors in this movie could have been nominated; especially Jackson and Dicaprio. The Story line is great so there will not be any dull moments with the movie. The rest of the supporting cast all stayed true to character and did a wonderful job. My initial reaction after watching Django Unchained was: \\"Wow that was a Good movie\\" but after a second viewing: Django Unchained gets:<br /><br />5 Stars
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Got this adorable movie for my friend's daughter's 4th birthday because she would borrow my copy and literally cry every time she brought it back.<br />The price is much better than any place I could find locally as they like to mark it as foreign which makes it a 35$+ film.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|its a great movie, a great pack and excellent format to watch this amazing movie. but unfortunately tne ultraviolet digital copy is not available for latin america, i hope soon fix that problem and bring this format to this part of the world
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love having the ability to download to my phone! Great read!!! Nice having it stored for the ability to read over.
B00BF123WG|2.0|Yes this movie is about the tedious but crucial work done to find bin laden but wow there was serious opportunity to better link how the pieces of information linked together to find his house. Disjointed and poorly made movie.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Not an overly exciting book, you know the ending long before you get there.  His writing prose is always excellent but the story line lacks that special something to grip the reader.
B009AMANBA|3.0|The acting was pretty good but the story was rather boring.  I was expecting a little more information on the civil war.  It demonstrates that politicians in this country haven't changed much in one hundred and fifty years!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This apps is great I use it to take notes in college. I can access the app on multiple devices.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is one of my grandson's favorite movies.  The story is cute.  The music is awesome. This is good family entertainment because us older folks loved it as much as the kids.
B001NA6096|4.0|I enjoyed the originality.  The scenery was great and they main characters seemed like ordinary people in a realistic situation.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I loved this book no one really talks about WW 1 and it was nice to learn about the war
B0019TSI8W|4.0|But, the all-star cast is very entertaining.  I think Striesand does a good job of directing.  I would watch it again.

1936608898|5.0|Now I must admit I've bought a few \\"This book will help you eat better/feel better\\" books and most of them have their merits but I followed the Whole30 rules and within  a couple weeks I felt better after three weeks the extra weight started melting away after 30 days ( i know this sounds dramatic) It was life changing.  I've learned to love foods that are good for me, I enjoy cooking fresh foods, My weird stomachaches and headaches and sinus trouble are not an issue and I'm sleeping better and yes I can say no to the cupcake offered to me. I'm so grateful that this book came into my life.

0988262592|5.0|Several people recommend this book. I wish I would have read it sooner.<br /><br />The book takes a look at how the Business usually sees IT, as a roadblock that can be replaced. However it doesn't stop there,the book shows the reader how to get the Business to realize that IT is really an enabler, and more than just the computers on the desks, and the web pages.<br /><br />This book should be on the reading list for everyone in IT. Even if they don't want to be Bill, the protagonist, it is important to be able to be able to talk to the business in ways management can understand.<br /><br />I've already started taking some of the items I learned and applied to them to what I'm doing currently.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Purchased this book and the recipe book at the same time.<br />Downloaded both on my Kindle (for convenience).  A<br />lot of wonderful advice and terrific guide.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Liked it.  I'm sure this will be very useful for my planned uses riding motorcycles cross country.  I see a lot of different uses.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I like this little backpack, holds my backup camera and all the goodies, and is of good quality. Not quite as nice as my Lowepro, but for $29- it's a deal!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful series. So glad I got into it.  I've learned so much about the period and issues I didn't know about.  The acting is top notch, the scripting excellent, and of course, the costuming and settings are superb.  I consider it education as well as entertainment.<br /><br />I do encourage anyone coming into the 3rd year to go back and watch the first 2 years.  It's well worth it.<br /><br />I've now seen the whole series 3 times, and I'm still watching.<br /><br />Yeah to the Brits for another quality series!  Thank you!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in our Stars is a powerful, emotional read (tissues necessary). Green is a genius. My favorite book of 2012.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Very fun, quirky movie.  I really enjoyed it.  Well casted, unique characters.  If you liked The Royal Tannenbaums, you will enjoy this.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I do enjoy playing uno and it works great! I have played it a number of times and no problems.
0385344333|4.0|This was my first Reacher novel and I must say that I am now a fan of Lee Child. You can really tell that Child is having fun as he writes about the six-foot-five behemoth of a man with the wits of a Jeopardy Grand Champion. You can see the fun that Child had even as he narrated the novel, from the casual conversation from Delfuenso's neighbor to the frank description of Reacher from the state trooper. Reacher even had to say, \\"Gorrilla?\\" At times as I read the novel, I could see Lee Child typing away and smiling. He might have even laughed out loud a time a two.<br /><br />\\"A Wanted Man,\\" places Jack Reacher in the heart of a mysterious murder. Whether it was fate that caused three travelers to pick him up as he hitchhiked on the Iowa highway or luck, I really don't know. But if it was luck, it was definitely bad luck. Child takes readers over flat terrain in the chilling cold as he toggles between Reacher and the investigators whose path he'll soon cross. Whether he crosses the law enforcers' paths as a partner or suspect, you'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />I really enjoyed \\"A Wanted Man.\\" There is a great twist in the book and then there's another twist. I'm a huge fan of twists but I'd rather have one big twist than two midsized twists. That was my only gripe with the novel, hence the title of my review. Give me one twist and let me shout. Keep the other twist for another book. That said, would I recommend \\"A Wanted Man\\" to my friends? Most definitely. I am a Reacher Fan for life!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I was encouraged to watch this series by several of my friends and found season 1, 2 & 3 available to watch for free with my Amazon Prime account. Wow .... I watched season 1 in one rainy weekend. This drama captured me ~ hook, line and sinker. I am loving it.<br />The writing is strong, the acting is as good as one finds on any other hit drama show.
B00881PTRC|5.0|great pass time..u can be on or off the internet!  love the animation..great themes..way better than the old hangman!! this is an awesome game!!!
0062059963|4.0|I was a big fan of THE SELECTION, so I was super excited to read THE ELITE, because Kiera Cass did a good job of leaving me with intriguing questions at the end of book one that needed to be addressed in book two.<br /><br />In THE ELITE, there is a lot less focus on the \\"reality TV\\" portions of the actual Selection, but I found I wasn't too disappointed (even though that was one of my favorite parts of the first book). This book had a lot more to do with America's feelings towards Maxon and Aspen, which made it more of an emotional read than the first book.<br /><br />There are times in THE ELITE when I felt like I had whiplash because America would be describing her feelings towards one guy and the next page she is talking about the other. But Cass wrote about this in a way that got me really involved in the book, and it also seems like this could be a realistic debate for a girl placed in a situation like this, so I didn't mind her flip flopping. I know in the end she's going to have to choose, I just hope that I feel confident about her choice.<br /><br />A little action in this one as well, as there are still rebels attacking the castle. I am very, very interested to see what happens in the next book. I have high hopes for Cass to pull it all together in a great way!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|ITS A GREAT GAME, The game levels are pretty cool, i love the different scenarios and awards and achievement levels. another great pass time and you don't have to be connected to the internet! the only thing i do not understand is how to connect to another device locally? any advice on that? other than that its fun, even when you connect online to play with others!

0060531053|5.0|If you want to homebrew are thinking about homebrewing or want a good reference guide for homebrewing this is it. If you can only have one homebrewing book this would be the one. And you just might not need another after you get this one.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|With all the big name stars you worry it will be a giant let down but this movie was great fast paced with great action and a little love story in it to keep the women interested.
1938469011|5.0|If you love hops this is for you, If you just maybe like hops you will love this book. its got appeal all over it. An interesting book that has way more info then you can use and after reading it you realize how summarizing it really is. There is way more to learn about hops but this is a good place to start,

B008476HBM|5.0|This favorite Austen novel is improved by being available on Kindle, because you are able to easily look up the definition of many archaic British words. It was as enjoyable a read this time as it was the first few times.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is a great show,  must watch in order from Episode 1.  Story line and time line keep you on the edge of your seat.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Versatile cover that swivels and sits upright.  Good selection of colors and easy to use.  Band to close is simple.  Great product!
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|We paid for HD and it was fuzzy, choppy, really terrible.  We tried watching a few times - pausing a bit then playing, rebooting router, clearly it was not a problem on our side.  This is the first and last time we rent from amazon streaming.  We have up on this rental and paid again to rent on Vudu and had no problems - crystal clear.
1885167776|1.0|They were not kidding in the title when they said it was surprisingly simple. It was too simple, in that most people beyond the age of 20 have already figured out success is based on focusing on only a few things and not trying to do everything. That's it, that is what the entire book is about. The author stretches this basic thought in to an entire book by including famous quotes and antidotal examples from other authors. This book at most should be the length of a brochure. I love good business and self-help authors, this is not one. I have never said this before, but do not waste your time reading this unoriginal and poorly written book.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is great! I cannot wait for the next book to hit stores! Hopefully that will happen soon enough.
B005DL9O5S|5.0|Fantastic value.  Excellent quality recordings.  There are 4 (or more?) recordings of the piano concerto number one.  Some rare operas.
B00AAQHP66|4.0|This is a &#34;feel good&#34; coming of age movie.  Mentor and student are both likable.  This is the REAL deal.  The waves were real and awesome to see.  I really hate all the digitalized action in movies of late, this was a breath of fresh air.
B008478VE8|5.0|This is a classic.  As if you didn't already know that.  Even if you do not believe in evolution, this should be mandatory reading, since it is such a monumental work in the world of science.
B00CBKVMG8|2.0|Needlessly boring, and a poor attempt at having an artistic side.  I would not recommend this to anybody, save your money.
1878424777|5.0|I have the written book and the audio to listen in my car! I just can't get enough of this man's wisdom!
1609611543|5.0|Warning: Do NOT skip the section that analyzes wheat's history and today's mostly genetically modifed wheat products. Absorbing this enables you to more fully embrace the author's conclusions on why it is prudent to change the way we eat. (If you MUST have bread, I recommend the Julian Bakery website for a great baked &#34;Paleo&#34; bread. For a six-item order baked fresh for you the shipping is modest. Otherwise you can bake it; recipe is supplied, plus more are on the Internet). As for Dr. Davis's style, you will find his research spiced with humor and well phrased to hold your interest. To sum up, you can find out how true his advice rings by TRYING his suggestions. They sure worked for me!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Great book, I have bought several copies for some of the young women I work with, These practices need to start at a much younger age than I figured them out!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I avoided this show for a long time, thinking: this is just what TV needs, another lawyer show. But after several people recommended The Good Wife, my husband and I finally caved and watched the first couple of episodes. And then we were hooked! This is not just a lawyer show, but top-notch political and family drama.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|I have a older vinyl  collection.  The new CD is a big improvement over the pops and scratches.  Good price for the memories as well.
0761166173|5.0|This is a delightful rhyming book about Pajama time.  The text rhymes so well, my son sings it to his son at bedtime.  This is very fun to read and one of my favorites of Sandra Boynton.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|I have a older vinyl collection.  This CD is a big improvement over the pops and scratches vinyl gets even when the vinyl is taken care of.  Better memories now..
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|good movies, but as in all the lord of the rings, more to come..kina long, but if you are a fan you will love it.

B007XF4J66|5.0|A friend of ours was having a birthday of a certain number and we put together a nostalgia gift of which this film, Casablanca, was one of the items.  It went over perfectly and she and her husband plan to watch it together when they go away for her birthday weekend.  This item arrived perfect condition and waaaaay before the expected date!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|After struggling through a whole  series of amazon's &#34;bargain&#34; books on kindle and wondering if the entire authors community had abdicated to who knows where, I decided in desperation to pay &#34;full fare&#34; for this book. What a great read. Not only does Sanderson craft an interesting novel, but he keeps the pace up for the entire book. The reader will get wrapped up in this book. I could hardly put it down at night. The characters are crafted to just about the right degree and the dialogue was to the right level for me. Often in other books, authors will feel like they have to add dialogue or voluminous pages of conversation that I find myself saying &#34;come on let's get back to the action. But in this case Sanderson does just about a perfect balance. The world he crafts is well set up and he keeps to his world &#34;rules&#34; in  a way that adds considerably to his novel. While I am one that will often wait for a lower price before I jump in for the next volume and makes exceptions only for those novels of rare craftsmanship, here is an exception... Save your money, don't buy the 99cent wrecks and put it in this novel. What a joy to read.
B008Y73940|4.0|I enjoyed watching the movie and yes I would recommend this to my friends and family. I mostly enjoyed watching it on my Kindle Fire Hd
B001VZY4M8|5.0|If you want a complete collection of 70s music, this one must be included.  The songs are some of the best of the time, and his delivery of same is right on the mark.  Love this one, for sure.
1616551151|3.0|This is one of those books that's long overdue, given the success of the franchise.  World of Thedas Vol 1 doesn't expand all that much on the Dragon Age universe and falls short in key areas.<br /><br />Chapters include: Legend, Map of Thedas, Races, Nations, Magic, Religion, The Fade, The Blight, Bestiary and Glossary.  It reads like an RPG sourcebook; granted it's derived from an RPG so that's hard to avoid, but I felt like I should have some dice handy while I was going through it.  The layout is gorgeous- some stunning artwork from familiar names like Joy Ang, Fran Gaulin, Jae-Keum, Steve Klit, Caspar Konefal and Nick Thornborrow.  Simply beautiful.<br /><br />There's cameos from some old friends- Varric, Leliana, Morrigan, Anders, and even Flemeth and Corypheus.  Brother Genitivi acts as the resident scholar, often supplying commentary on the entries as well.<br /><br />Much of the information presented is not new, simply fleshed out.  And that's where the problems come in: while there are some interesting nuggets and pearls, too many times you'll see either a contradiction to the established canon or something so lacking you wonder why they even bothered with it.  And others just leave you scratching your head.<br /><br />Here's a few examples:<br /><br />Endrin Aeducan is stated to be mourning the loss of his eldest and youngest sons (it's supposed to be his eldest and middle child).  Seems small but it's a huge error if you know the franchise... and how'd they miss it?<br /><br />Noble ranks in Ferelden- the place we're all most familiar with- are also off, listing an arl as the equivalent of a mayor.  Really? Isn't an arl supposed to be an earl or something?  Heck, the Bioware chatrooms have better and more detailed info than this 'official' release.<br /><br />New details about Wardens and the Calling are also confusing: the book states that they must first serve alongside dwarven troops for a year before going off on their own.  Since when?  And what's the point of it if they're not going to even last that long anyway?  Also no new information about the Joining Ritual or how it was discovered.<br /><br />The chapter on Religion is where it really drops the ball in my opinion.  The section on the Old Gods is sketchy- no surprise there- but something about them would've been appreciated.  Were they vessels for powerful extra-planar beings or just dragons with powers and abilities far beyond those of other flying serpents?  The Elven Gods get a little better treatment- they're supposedly all trapped in the Black City.  How?  Why?<br /><br />Humanity is the newest race on Thedas; apparently they all came from somewhere else...  But as they make up nearly all of the Maker's worshipers, what was he doing all that time, let alone before Andraste showed up?  Who were his followers?<br /><br />Kossith (Qunari) are said to have migrated to Ferelden in ages past, giving rise to ogre darkspawn. But then why hasn't anyone ever seen any ogres before the Fifth Blight?<br /><br />World of Thedas is nice enough to have; you get lots of data conveniently packaged for your enjoyment.  But there's precious little new information provided in it so it's a toss up as to whether it's worth your while or not.he point of it if they're not going to even last that long anyway?

0451232577|4.0|didn't know it is so very heavy....I have bad arthritis in my hands &  have trouble holding the book...wish it came in 2 or 3 books.  just started reading it...thinking of cutting it so I can hold it.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My kids loved getting this movie in the mail earlier than they thought we would get it.  Very satisfied with the service!
1905236042|4.0|My kids pull these out when I pull out my yoga mat.  Fun and interesting.  Helps the whole family get into yoga as well as good teaching ideas for yoga instructors.
B007HO392S|5.0|I love Carrie Underwood...she appears to be a wonderful and kind spirit.  Keep them coming, Carrie.  I think most would love this CD.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this sample as a suggestion from Amazon and was immediately hooked. I wanted to know more. I found this story refreshingly new and interesting from the start and I got sucked deeper into this Silo. I've read all the stories and cannot wait for the next one. Thank you Hugh Howey!<br /><br />The story is a futuristic end-of-the-world type story where people now live underground and have no memory of the world &#34;outside&#34;, which is totally destroyed and toxic. There is 148 floors of this massive self-sustaining silo and no elevators. A unique culture, religion and law emerges with good guys and bad guys. Ultimately it comes to a head when our heroin realizes there are 50 silos!<br /><br />This is a must read for any sci-fi junky. Enjoy!
B000HF6XKO|4.0|Star-studded cast, good plot and plot development. I recommend it as one to watch. Especially for people who love political movies with international touch.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was good and I hope he keeps marking more because wall of them are worth time for reading
B000JCQCW4|3.0|I had heard about this movie so I decided to watch it. Alittle too raw and depressing for me. Really portrays the destructive effects of drugs.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|loved it, loved it, loved it and I absolultly loved it. I enjoyed the other 2 just at much if not more
B000VMIILU|3.0|The first 20 minutes or so focus on a fictitious history.  Researchers tell us that in actuality - surprise! - nobody believed or taught \\"flat earth\\" until Washington Irving inserted this novel concept in his book on the life of Columbus.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|loved it, Ok so the the first book was awesome and I loved this one just at much and would recommend
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|I have always been a fan of Darlene Zschech, I'm mostly a fan of live recordings, this one is a really good one. My favorite song is &#34;In the name of Jesus&#34; what a powerful song! I also enjoyed her version of some of Israel H. songs, all in all I recommend it!
B003102IR4|5.0|I love this Bob Marley CD.  It arrived on time and in good condition.  I would definitely recommend this CD to friends and family and have already done so.
B0073B587E|4.0|I think it is perfect for me, finger tipping diabetes testing....<br />Works well, sound is great, one sad thing, cannot connect to external amp... I rebuilt it but took some time otherwise I would rate it 5*
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very different book than other mysteries I've read!  Exciting read though.  I am used to reading series' mysteries where I like the characters.  Needless to say, I didn't like the characters in this book.  But, it was a Best Seller for a reason. So gave it a shot.<br />I would definitely recommend this book if asked for my opinion, because I couldn't wait to see how it ended!  Very weird though!  Did not predict this one at all....<br />Fist time reader of Ms. Flynn, so would definitely read another book out of curiousity.  Not sure I like her style.  But, would give her talent another chance before writing off her books from my favorites.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game more and more each day that I play! I first downloaded Nemo's Reef on my Aneroid phone and liked it so much I now have a second reef growing on my Kindle Fire! Nemo's Reef isn't your same old boring plant and harvest game; there's something new, fun, and exciting to do everyday! The graphics are great in quality and cute as well! I am 25 and i absolutely love this game; I recommend it to both you and your kids!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Having finished reading I both admire and am equally disappointed at how mean spirited he could be. You could almost feel the shame and hurt he caused in his quest for greatness. He was shameless yet brilliant, super ego well defined. I feel like a red headed step child after that reading. What a whirlwind of ups and downs. A must read for all Mac and Apple enthusiasts.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|This historical-drama has kept me pretty entertained throughout the first season. If you are looking for a straight non-fictional account, look elsewhere, as there are definitely some liberties taken (at least, as I understand the history of the period). With that said, it is often &#34;close enough&#34; that it is easy enough for me (and probably most people who aren't sticklers for medieval English history) to suspend disbelief and enjoy trials and tribulations of the young king of the House of Tudor and the other notables of the time.<br /><br />The actors have sort of a &#34;The Wire&#34;-feel to them in that there aren't too many household names, but most of the parts seem to be filled by experienced actors who do a good enough job. Also, the story arcs often span several episodes and require a little patience, but I find that enjoyable in today's world where every scene must have a cut-away in 20 seconds or less and every conflict be resolved after 45 min.<br /><br />This is not a cinema masterpiece by any means, but I gave it 4/5, because the first season was a sort of fun--if mindless--, relaxing, and entertaining watch.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I've played a few games like it, but this one is the best so far. I like that you get to select where you start geographically, and there is a lot more customization when it comes to the plague itself. Its very fun, and I've spent a lot of time playing.<br /><br />I play on two separate devices, so the ability to have a user id and be able to log into different devices would be nice!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I like the story line.....Very colorful, sweet, and keeps you interested .....I like the Red Hair for a change.... Nice
B00CATSONE|5.0|I knew a little bit about Tesla, but this book did a great job of going into more depth about his greatness. It was fairly short, but it got right to the point, plus it was free, so I wasn't expecting a huge book.<br /><br />If you are interested in Tesla, and want to get more information about his life(other than what is on his Wikipedia page) this is worth the read.
B00CATONCA|5.0|Once Battlestar Galactica and Lost were finished, I doubted whether a weekly series could grab my attention again, and thankfully, I was wrong. The story line, graphics, and characters make this show second to none. Even my 70 year old mother is hooked, and says that nothing since MASH has had her tuning in like this show does.<br />If you haven't seen WD, it's not just a mindless zombie show. It's a soap opera about survival, built around an apocalypse. The characters have different views, beliefs, religious outlooks, and pasts, and this, along with interactions between them and the dangers they oppose, make this the best show on television. And to know that virtually nobody on the show is \\"safe\\", will bring you back week after week.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|The box was a little bit beat up, but the disc's were in good shape and no problem playing them so far. I love the &#34;Supernatural&#34; Series.
B00AEBB8BA|4.0|I wasn't too surprised with the simple story line, but liked the fact that one man can do the right thing. We all need to realize our choices make us who we are and what we allow to happen makes our world what it is. Shooter shouts to our inner man...... be who you are and do what you do best.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the back and forth between the two main characters a lot...seeing into their real selves...and revealing a deceit thoroughly hidden from the world.  I was bit disappointed at the ending, somehow feeling things could have somehow ended up better for the husband...ie somehow kill off the wife, hint hint.
0525953590|5.0|I've read several books on the subject and this is, to me, the best so far.<br /><br />A difficult if not impossible subject for most of us to understand, this book is lucid and does a great job of clarifying a great many concepts that are so hard to concive.<br /><br />I hear people say that the Higgs has been found and I would just say, CERN has found a particle that looks like they would expect the Higgs to look, but at will be a long time before we can be sure and that is clearly discussed in the book.<br /><br />This book was fun to read, I really enjoyed it and my family put up with my excited explainations of things I have read and tried to share.  They are very kind to listen.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|this book is really good.  i really enjoy all of kinney's books because of the humor, the illistrations, and all of the realistickness
0440245915|5.0|This book has been out a while but I have just read it. It is very, very good.<br /><br />A 10 year old black girl is raped, beaten and thought left for dead by two drunk white men. The men are caught and when they appear in Court the little girls father kills both of them.<br /><br />The father hires a local attorney to defend him and the suspence will hold you for several hours. The KKK gets involved, the NAACP, a paid Dr. Death threats are made against the lawyer and his family, the father and his family, a member of the jury and his family.<br /><br />Will the jury convict or set free? A spellbounding read.

0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone written by Ishmael Beah is a detailed book about his experiences through life.  In the beginning I thought the book would be like any other \\"documentary\\" type of book and be boring, but I did not find that to be the case at all.  Beah being a child soldier in the Sierra Leone Civil war, he vividly demonstrated the hardships he went through and suffered down to how the government was run and the living conditions he had to be in.  It was heart wrenching to read about Beah's struggles as a child, first off being forced into fight the war, and at the same time having to fend for himself and be his own parent. Nobody was there to watch over him or take care of him.  At a very young age, he saw death left and right and it was no shock that he lost a sense of himself when he was in the war.  He himself became one that would kill and it did not affect him at all.  It is hard to relate oneself to Beah's story because most of us living in the United States were not forced to serve in the military unwillingly and forced to fend for themselves at such a young age.  It was nice to read the part where he kind of comes to a reality check and realizes that killing is not the type of person he is.  At such a young age, being brain washed and being able to realize after that one is doing something immoral was empowering.  In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Beah and how much hardships he encountered at such a young age.
B009POCG2C|3.0|I wish I would have researched this movie before I bought it.  I liked the actors but I didn't like Clint Eastwood's role in this movie.  Everyone else was good.  Wait for it to come out on cable - don't buy it.
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|If you are a Riverside fan, there are no major surprises here and this disc will be one of those that is in and out of player often.  Great musicianship and composition throughout...  There is a solid mix of melodic acoustic selections and the more unleashed side of the band.  Some may like one more than the other, but as a whole it is a very good album.  I give it 4.5 stars overall.
B005D4YGTY|5.0|2nd time around on these KEEN's.  Most comfortable sandal I have ever worn, can even be worn w/ socks!<br />Don't buy the Newport H2 version, mine came apart in less than 2 months and the fit was much tighter for the same size as my Newports.<br /><br />I own 4 pairs of KEEN's, so I'm a fan.
B001GA1RFA|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, and it was funny. I didn't love it as much as the other books by this author but it was still a good read. It was slow in the beginning but picked up pace nicely.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I felt that there was some quality acting in the movie, but , with me the ending is a big part of any movie, and in this movie's case the ending fell short of answering the questions that the story created.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I love it. The sound of Daft Punk is back after all these years. They had been sorely missed but never forgotten.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Enjoy this game so much! I recommend this for download. The updates keep making an already fun game even more awesome.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Soothing sounds, easy to use, love it!  Downloaded it just for fun but now both my husband and I use it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a very nice app. Very calming. My 6 year old daughter loves it! It's very easy to use.
B008C2GVUG|5.0|I now own this movie on DVD, BluRay and now this edition of the BluRay. A little crazy? Sure why not. If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and pick it up. Most need to watch it more than once to really appreciate all of the dialogue and story.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This is a great story with (mostly) perfect voices. The retro video game nuances was a really wonderful touch for a gal that enjoyed arcades and playing SNES at friends' houses when growing up in the 90s. But, I miss the days when voice actors were picked for their talent of voice charisma rather than there name. Don't get me wrong, John C. Reilly and Jack McBrayer were actually perfect, and I didn't even realize that Alan Tudyk was the voice of \\"the big bad\\" - but having Sarah Silverman doing her creepy little girl voice was a bit annoying, and oddly distracting. I would have been quite happy with a no-name with great voice acting in that starring role.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you are a fan of video games and Pixar - then DON'T miss this movie. Really, my small gripe with this movie is so minuscule it shouldn't take away from the beauty that Pixar is able to create. They did such wonderful things for the \\"forever\\" video game fan that it is almost perfect.<br /><br />Plus, the Pixar short, Oscar winning \\"Paperman\\" is worth the price of admission on its own.<br /><br />Bottom line, buy it!
B0049J5EWW|5.0|I've always loved this movie, and it is a great classic to re-watch when feeling a bit tired or down and needing a simple escape from reality into the world of movies. The writing is better every time I watch it! So many things I didn't pick up on as a kid that are quite entertaining as an adult!
B00005AXKF|5.0|My grandchildren and I sit and watch it over and over again and I don't mind it.  Its a wonderful story and they love the three soldiers.
B0094M1NJC|4.0|I expected a movie about becoming a rising country star, but this was more about the trials and tribulations of constantly being in the media, being judged, and the pressures of the music industry. It was still an interesting story.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I loved the first meeting of Minnie and Robert. This book made me laugh out loud as well as yell at the characters.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|The music is fantastic! Additionally, the simple premise of Forrest's perspective is well-played by Tom Hanks. It's a nice, slow, emotionally uplifting film.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Cute show re: Teenage angst.<br />Very funny take by guidance counsellor.<br />Very atypical take regarding &#34;mean girl&#34; body habitus.<br />Every player does a good job.
B001B6PBBK|3.0|The story develops a bit slowly, and the characters are kind of bland. The premise is completely predictable (as is the case with most chick flicks, though), but it's still cute.
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|It's mellow and similar to the Tron Legacy soundtrack. If you like M83, and that type of electronic music you will like this soundtrack.
B00BHU9DUK|3.0|It took a while to adjust to the transition component in &#34;play&#34; format. I don't feel it added to the story whatsoever. Also, the story started very slow and took a drastic change that wasn't played out smoothly and didn't seem to fit. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't captivating, either.
0374531269|4.0|A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier is an honest and heart breaking story about the story of the author, Ishmael Beah. He had to become a child soldier at the age of twelve and was killing and attacking other people like a terrorist. It is awful to even imagine someone, let alone a child, being capable of this violence. Ishmael Beah shows tremendous courage and strength while sharing his story. After studying globalization and feminism, I was able to read this book in a different view than I would have before. Of course, I would see this as terrible in both situations. However, I view this as another unfortunate case that is unnoticed in the world. It is extremely eye opening to know the truth of this terror. I would highly recommend this book for future classes on globalization, because of Ishmael Beah's moving writing and a story that will have an impact on everyone that reads this book.
B003DS9ECQ|5.0|This was one of my favorite as a kid, and still holds up as an adult! I love the integration of the NBA players.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love this show, I have just finishing watching Season 1 and am now watching season 11, it delves deeply into how Attorneys work and Play, I would recommend this show very highly.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|This movie focuses on a character who is so passionate about her work and so dedicated to its purpose that she doesn't let anything bring her down. In a deliberate sense, it's an incredibly uplifting movie for people devoted to their work who often feel like their passion is under-appreciated.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book is amazing and I highly recommend everyone to read it and follow your personal legend no matter how difficult it seems at times
B000JWTX3Y|4.0|While the premise is completely unrealistic, the story development is cute. There are classic blunders and romantic moments, and a feel-good story all-around.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I liked this book. I could really picture what was happening in the story. I just couldn't put it down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the trilogy and this was the second time of me reading these books. I love the story line, the characters the scenes.
B00280LYIM|4.0|this book is a very good reading experience. it has great details and you can easily picture what is happening in the story.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I like James Bond films and this one was the latest in a long line.  Kept my interest from beginning to end.
086547897X|5.0|There was a surprising amount of unnecessary profanity in this book. Mostly in the way of taking God's name in vain, but it's nothing some white-out can't fix. Other than that, this is the best book on animation I've come across, Highly useful information, great for novice animators as well as a refresher of the basics for seasoned animation professionals.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|i bought this for my sister's birthday because she loves the books. the movies are great and they each come in their own case inside the box, not all stacked on tope of one another.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|The story of the Luftwaffe fighter pilot who allowed a U.S. Air Force B-17 to &#34;escape&#34; and return to England is uplifting, although that incident takes up a relatively small portion of this book. Much more time is devoted to the backgrounds of the German pilot and the American pilot, and those accounts seem to be weighted more toward the German. I would liked to have seen more attention to the efforts of the two pilots to find each other years later. To me, the most interesting aspect of the book were the accounts of the day-to-day life of the German pilots, how they felt the war was lost from the beginning, and their hatred of Goering. I note, however, that such stories seem to be based on the memories of one pilot, and I wonder how widespread those attitudes were.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I love this game. It is  very fun too. I love all the puzzles and how you get to solve all of them in different ways including the hidden objects puzzle. As I am a hard core gamer, I am so glad I gave this game a chance. If you like mini games with a horror twist then this is the prefect game for you.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Definitely not happy with this game.I would not recommend purchase of this game unless improvements to it are made. Thank you.
B002JVWR4A|4.0|Got this order very fast and had no problems with this DVD. It was a great season of bones and love having this DVD
0765325950|5.0|There has been a lot of complaint since the release of this book about it not being an unsatisfying ending to the Wheel of Time. I understand those complaints. I really do. I also realize that this is a series that could never live up to the ending we all expected. With that in mind, I set aside my own thoughts on how this should play out and I rode the ride to the very end. You know what? It was fun. I enjoyed this book immensely and I can't recommend it and the series enough. Just go in remembering to set aside all your assumptions!
B00B22IJXK|3.0|I downloaded this to try it out but found it didn't really suit my needs.  The app is very limited compared to the suite of tools provided by Sketchpad.  Glad to see it as FAOTD though.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This story is by far one of my favorites -- a tale that takes the reader through the healing of a young woman after the loss of beloved husband. It is a funny, wise, touching story that takes the young woman back to where her love for her husband was born and leaves us all with the hope of the future!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I've watched Dr WHO for a long time and this series is one that I liked a lot so I had to get it.I have some of the earlyones and enjoyed them so I'm sure I'll enjoy this one since I watched this one on PBS.I would definetly recommend this series to any WHO fan.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this is an amazing game but, temple run is better for me because i like my games Challenging
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A sad look at life where poverty reigned. The very act of acquiring food for young ones through theft, caused a man to suffer for a whole lifetime, there were very few people who even cared to help. It was better to see the bad instead of the good. It makes one want to give aid to those who need it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Super cute game, good way to kill time...the next thing you know it's been hour!! Lol. It is a cool learning kid for kids and even adults if you don't know much about the plants in the ocean.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|lower your guard and open your imagination. No. it's not Star-Trek or anything else you've seen before. I love this low tech British sci-fi. Why not. it's just a lot of fun...
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Please read this book.  It is so fantastic and mind blowing. A fascinating study of human and animal nature in perilous circumstances.  A must read.
0756655307|5.0|A great deep insight into all the different characters of the Marvel comics, all our favourite heroes and villains from Captain America to Xmen are all mentioned each with their stories recapping how each one of them became the heroes and the villains that we grew up reading about in the comic books, as well as their history - their real names are all mentioned. Great reference, great book.
B0031R5K8G|4.0|This story is great at showing you how a boy affected by autism perceives the world around him. Truly engaging and eye-opening read. Laughs are not spared :)
B00947N6UG|5.0|Me and my family really enjoyed this film. It had a few twists and kept a fast pace.  You'll be happy to add this to your library.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Barbie Collector Hunger Games Katniss Everdeen Doll. This was a gift for my young niece for her birthday she loved it.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with this scanner but it far exceeds my expectations!  Slides are digitized very quickly and easily with beautiful results, even after being stored in a basement for decades. All of the necessary cables come with this scanner - USB for computers and other devices, and the audio/video cables for older TV sets.  Extremely easy to use.  Be careful to make sure you read the directions first to make sure you're capturing the correct slide/film type.  It only took about 4 hours to capture 500 slides to disk and have them playing on our TV.  As mentioned in other reviews, keep a pair of needle nose pliers on hand and a pair of scissors. Slides before mid 1960's are just a bit wider than the slot and may need trimmed. I also found that a 4GB SD card holds a little over 5000 (yes, five thousand) color slides if captured at 5MB resolution.  I expected them to be a bit fuzzy when viewed on a large screen tv.  They are clearer and sharper than their originals.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|This show is not worth watching.  I should have know there was a problem with the show when in the beginning they showed the number Pi and it was WRONG!..
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Saw the movie in October. Had ordered a set for Christmas, but the movie was on bluray.  This movie was on DVD!!!  It is teriffic.  Could not be happier.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love Disney this game reminds me of everything Disney. The graphics are absolutely fantastic it is like you are actually in nemo. I would recommend this game to others.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Absolute cutest movie ever. My 1 year sat through it from start to end which says a lot since she doesn't even sit through a nap.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Forget Orwell 's 1984: Big Brother is alive and well in North Korea, and scarier than than any imagined autocrat. Everyone who frets about American \\"tyranny\\" would do well to read this, and remember what true tyranny looks like.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Wonderful benefit! Such a great way to hold you photo and it's free!  Thanks for all you do.  Love Amazon.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|I love the orchestral pieces! I believe that they truly underscore the emotion of the movie, and that the movie wouldn't be the same without them. :) I could say a lot more, but I'll leave it at that.
B00B0HXC4I|5.0|You'll be singing these satanic songs to yourself for weeks.  This album is a lot more &#34;metal&#34; sounding than the second album.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|If your into fantasy and historical epics this is one to look at.  Very interesting characters, intriguing plot twists and enough action to keep you wanting more.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I am such a big fan of not only Stephanie Meyer`s twilight saga novels but also very much enjoyed the movies. If you enjoy a true love story and bonds of family, this is the perfect story for you!
B0083GQKQG|3.0|Interesting but morbid.  If I was his mother, I wold have left him to rot in jail and not visited.
B0043LYXJ6|5.0|No problems with the disc.<br /><br />Great movie.....especially in blu ray.<br /><br />Fast shipping!<br /><br />Would highly recommending this to others.<br /><br />A great movie for the family to watch together.
B000GOWNPU|5.0|Great revenge flick.  The bad guys really get what they deserve in the end.  Sad to see how some of the victims turned out.
B00BJDARGO|4.0|For me being a HUGE Whitesnake fan and own just about everything that Mr. Coverdale has ever released. I was alittle disapointed in this release just because it was (like a lot of you are saying) a half a show. I found out the reason for that was it was taped for TV in Japan. The band could only get so much of the show so that they could release it. I understand this and I will being truely enjoying this release for years to come.<br /><br />The show itself is amazing the band sounds so great. David sounds amazing, Tishy is a monster and the best drummer the band has ever had. Tommy a VERY close second. And Doug and Reb are so Fin' tight, best guitar tandum the band has EVER had. The 2 standout moments in the show is Forevermore and the best version I've heard of Fool for Your Lovin'.<br /><br />......Fans don't fret Mr. Coverdale has hinted at a few more great realeases for 2013. THE YEAR OF THE SNAKE 2013!!!!!!!!
B005C7SXMS|4.0|Submarine as a film is one of those strange creatures that suggests something simply from the marketing. With its vintage look and crafted quirk, one would be forgiven for thinking that Submarine was a Wes Anderson also-ran, stealing style to cover for itself.<br /><br />Thankfully, that is far from the case, and Submarine instead is an entertaining (though not always fun) dance through the mine field of young love and personal self-discover, and the difficult of breaking out of the limits of childhood into adulthood. That's not to say it isn't a comedy, because it is, but Submarine is a far bleaker look at these situations than you'd fine in Wes Anderson, and instead has more in common with 70s coming-of-age stories like Harold and Maude.<br /><br />If that sounds too-glowing, I'll admit that Submarine is not as good as that. It is a first film from a young director, and while it hits far more than it misses, one can't help but wonder just how much of the tonally nostalgic callbacks are genuine to memory and place and time, and how much it's simply more mining of references to try to lend gravitas to what is essentially a typical teenage story.
B00008CLOA|5.0|If you're a real Floyd fan, you probably already have a copy.  Get a copy. Great to exercise my surround system
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I enjoyed the serial nature of these books.  Pres Ryan is a great follow up character, and junior is becoming interesting.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|good movie, kind of expected more from bruce willis movie. but it was good and at times funny. will watch it again
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Please fix this apk. so it will install. This is a great app otherwise. It's worthy of five stars. Please fix it!
B00BI745AA|5.0|This movie really touch my soul in the sense that a love for a child is endless and the impossible is possible. His big heart made me wish there was more people like him back at that era and now. How many innocent people were put in jail like they are now.
0984999302|5.0|Found it an easy (although a bit redundant) book to follow.<br />Structured as a guide has all the useful insights for those who want to start and launch a business.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|To think he lives right here in Detroit!  What an amazing documentary.  Loved every minute of it!  Such a humble talent!
0470876417|5.0|A must read. Not once, but many, many times. It's a book that you must have it ready as a reference everyday.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The new series are just wonderful, good story line, excellent acting, the graphics are super, I love this series.<br />What a wonderful ride!
B000GCFO0S|5.0|Spooky! Have your snacks and beverages all ready to go because you won't want to leave your seat until the end of the movie!
B008JFUO4U|1.0|I did not like this movie at all. I seen it at the movies and its the worse one that i ever seen in along time. I would rate this movie a 0. this movie was very boring and didn't make any sense which so ever. I can't be there trying to make this look like an alien movie. theres no aliens which so ever. I say don;t waste your money  at the movies for this movie. This movie is lame to. Making it look like the robots are taking over earth.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Great story, acting, and construction of characters. A film that at first seemed not worth watching turned out to be a pleasant surprise.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|A fantastic &#34;Pink Floyd style&#34; show. Better then this one only the &#34;David Gilmour - Remember That Night&#34; Blue-Ray that is out of this world.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Was worried that it might scare my daughter, but she loves it!!! (She's 4 1/2 yrs old) Great movie! Definitely recommend it!
B000UD08HW|5.0|This is certainly the best David Gilmour's live performance of all times. Without Pink Floyd's superproductions, his tallent came up and the show is fantastic. A must have BlueRay at any pop-rock fan colection.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! I LOVE it probably MORE than my 4.5 yr old daughter...she likes it, but I love it!!! Love Santa with tattoos, and lots of funny lines for adults and kids!
B003JUGQ38|4.0|Following with all the other Seasons, the show is great.  Don't care much for the Donna character though, too pissy.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the format of this game and its fun to play but the ads are excessive. I realize it's a free game but seriously cut down on the ads.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book! Defying the capitol, mocking jays, and especially katniss,peeta, and gale!! I don't want to give it away but UPRISINGS DUDE, UPRISINGS.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|The movie is great - the 3D quality is great - the only problem I had was that the product description was for the version with all the alternate endings and additional content - but this is NOT that - it's just the 3D version of the original theatrical release.<br /><br />Maybe I missed something - maybe the additional content was included on the DVD, which I have no reason to load since I'm using Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the quintessential 3D blockbuster and it's great to finally have it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Is like this game because you can make family's plus you can go to level 400 in this game. One other cool thing is that you can take there there money for taxes.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My oldest got me hooked on Walking Dead.  It was slow Season 1, episode 1 and 2 but I could not wait to see the next one after the 3rd episode...Now I am impatiently waiting for season 4 :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show awesome cast!!! Show rocks can not wait till next season....October is too far away!!!  So I'll watch reruns till then.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Don't start watching any of the Doctors without starting at season one.  The show is a lot of fun, may be scary for young viewers.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Well done! I would not normally see myself reading a book about teenagers with cancer, as I don't have this going on in my family or friends, and I am 63 years old, but the book was so good I could not stop reading it- crying and laughing- it was heart-felt.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I enjoyed it even though &#34;Bucky&#34; and the &#34;Red Skull&#34; were not the same as in the original stories. I recommend this to superhero fans.
B006LSZECO|5.0|i enjoyed being surprised by all the twists and turns in this novel.  i would recommend it and will be purchasing her other books soon.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|I won't rate it as good as the Batman reboot, the X-Men, the Amazing Spiderman, but it is certainly worth a look to those that read Green Lantern in the 60's.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book is so well written, and it delves so thoughtfully into the mind of a father who is trying hard to reconcile his life and his family's lives with the brutality of his teenage son being on trial for murder. While the book has an average number of pages, the writing makes us feel the duration of the trial and its periods of boredom accentuated by minor victories and defeats. I had no idea which way it was going to go in the end, and it was very gratifying that it did not signal too early which way things were going to go. If you like courtroom dramas, this one is a bit different because it is told neither from the point of view of one of the lawyers or from the accused, but rather the father of the accused. But I think you will enjoy it all the more for its different perspective.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Having grown up on the Avengers and superheros in the late 50's through early 70's. I love what Marvel has down with their line of movies (with some exceptions). I think they finally got the Hulk right. I also love the mix of humor with action. The bigger the screen the better for a lot of the action. If you like superhero movies, get this one.<br />'Nuff Said!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Besides being a padded cover, I can rotate my Kindle to a portrait or landscape view. This cover also allows my Kindle to stand alone while still in the case.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|The origin didn't follow the comic book at all and neither did his human love interest Jane Foster (she was his secret identity Dr. Blake's nurse as I recall), However, I'd watch Natale Portman any day even if they changed everything. They did respect to &#34;Dr. Blake&#34; and I liked the way they introduced Hawkeye.<br />You should really see Iron Man, Captain America and Thor before seeing the Avengers.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I like shows like True Blood, so I was excited to hear about American Horror Story. I was even more excited for it to be available on Prime. I, of course, was late to the AHS party, so I needed to catch up on both Seasons 1 and 2.<br /><br />Overall, it was fun, exciting, spooky, and had a good story line. I thought the ending was a little cheesy, and I thought parts of the season were slow. However, I've heard Season 2 is even better. If you like stuff like True Blood, you'll like AHS a lot. I definitely didn't regret watching it.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Perhaps my expectations were too high. We did enjoy the imagery but they should have made one movie at of the book instead of three. It is beautifully done when projected on a large screen. I don't know if I would have bought it if I had seen it in the theaters or only had a smaller screen (50 inches or less).
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed watching the first season.  After following the show for so many years, it was interesting to see the characters from the beginning, and remember old characters (Burke, George, Izzy, Denny.)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Super handy. Works great. I keep the shortcut on my screen which gives me the 'at a glance' info and then I check the forecast every night to plan the next day's wardrobe.
B006QF61VA|5.0|Two of my all time favorite movies are Dead Poets Society and Goof Will Hunting, being only 19 i am starting to appreciate older movies more. This was completely in par with the other great films Robin Williams did. I highly recommend this to anyone hoping to learn a little bit about themselves and about how tough life can be.<br />Good Bye Vietnam!!!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This film covers the Iran-hostage crisis with wit and humor. It is an excellent way to learn history. It features recognizable actors and captures the joy of their release.
B00A72989U|5.0|I love all songs on this CD I am a very big Alicia Keys fan!!!  I would recommend this to everyone!!!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I enjoyed this book as I have all of Reich's . She is a master at writing and keeps my interest sparked.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Very different normally listen to Jazz and some R & B good choice I like it very much!! I have recommended this CD to my friends.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I wish the game was a little longer for the price. Other than that it is a very interesting game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game Its very nice game thanks everybody for creating it so please make it more crazy and lovely : )
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is awesome.  Original puzzle solving that kept me entertained for a couple of hours.  Well worth the price and can't wait for the next one!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game IS fun to play when it doesn't freeze up. It's hard to play the free daily tournament without freezing...especially with so many people playing at one time. I think it may not give all credits as earned either.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Well first, I got this because lots of people at my school keep talking about it, and having positive sayings about it. So, I decided to try it out. When I first played it, I got so so confused. I am just hitting blocks man! What am I supposed to do! Anyway, I really didn't enjoyed it too well. It's just my opinion. At least I didn't give it a one star.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie was pretty good. I think they got the characters right with the casting. The movie had plenty of suspense even though you already know what the outcome is going to be.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the interesting facts you don't see in the movie like how long it took for Cato to die
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|first of all I think is a really cute and adorable game to play I have not try it yet but I will and I think I will really like it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, it's so fun give it a try. I know you will love it as much as I do.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|do not know what it is about yet.but will love it I bet loved book two and one.love.going to be so great I bet.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I prefer Shaara's writing style & character development but this is well written and (I think) excellent glimpses at life in the early 20th century.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|A truly fantastic performance by a great singer.  I Can't wait to see her in concert in London in June.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Although I love what's on these discs, I'm bitterly disappointed that the spectacular exit music at the end of the film as the credits roll is not included. I really don't understand why that dumb decision was made.
B004UXUUJE|5.0|Good story and was very moved. The movie is realistic but at least there is closure. Very intrigued with movies from an awful time in our history. Certainly gives you compassion for the struggles people have had to endure.
0062231375|4.0|If you want to retain the image of a top chef being a patient, polite, perfect person who works in a zen-like environment dispensing small plates of culinary goodness, this book is certainly not for you. If you want to get a warts and all look at what can go on in a top kitchen (and many others) read on...<br /><br />This is a pocket-sized paperback book that is just crying out to be your travelling companion, encapsulating the wit and wisdom of top chef Anthony Bourdain in a revised, annotated version of a classic. Clearly a book of this nature will see the author's personality come right out of the page, in your face as it were, but there are not pages upon pages of \\"illustrative\\" photography of the chef and his gurning face in \\"lifestyle poses.\\" Fortunately the text has to do the work and an engaging read it is too.<br /><br />There are things that will have your jaw firmly drooping towards your chest as you read through this, no matter how much you thought you knew about what happened behind the swing doors in a professional, high pressure kitchen. There might even be things you wished that you never knew, but the magic will still remain. You might just view things in a slightly different light in the future...<br /><br />Throughout the book there are many scrawled (printed) notes and annotations in what is said to be the author's own handwriting. In some ways this just felt a bit cheesy, instead of using a printed footnote, but it didn't irritate this reviewer and the additional bits and pieces gave a little more of an insight. Of course, the annotations were hardly spontaneous and off the cuff... The book's small size might feel a bit of a hard read for those with less than perfect eyesight but you certainly won't have to worry about overspilling into a neighbour's seat whilst you are on a holiday flight somewhere.<br /><br />This is one of those books that you can (and should) read several times. With each read through new bits of information come out, other dots become joined and more \\"aha!\\" moments possibly follow. Should you even remotely be interested in what goes on behind the scenes, this is a great informative, yet light read for you.dots become joined and more \\"aha!\\" moments possibly follow.

B00003CWLF|5.0|This movie I could watch over and over again. The acting is superb, the movie shows the clash of two cultures and the costums are outstanding.
B003XF1OK4|5.0|How did I ever miss this book?  It won the Pulitzer Prize and other prestigious awards.  How did I miss the movie?  Virginia Woolf is one of my favorite writers.  Because my name, Clarissa,  was rare while growing up, I always made a point to read books whose heroine, like Mrs. Dalloway,  shared that first name. So how did I miss this? I must remain grateful for accidentally stumbling across a volume that echoes fleeting thoughts and feelings during the course of a lifetime.  There is not much I can add  in a review about a multi award-winning book that is so close to perfection, but I want to encourage anyone interested in Virginia Woolf, lesbian/gay issues or suicide to consider reading it.  It is so much more than issues, of course. That is merely one level.  At times, Cunningham's voice is identical to Woolf's, reminiscent of the novel To The Lighthouse or the essay A Room of One's Own, the magical, almost unbearable, Virginia Woolf sentences that many of us have aspired to emulate but never could write.  I finished reading this spectacular story in tears...
B005S9EJ46|5.0|The movie is excellent.  Shows a humorous side of getting older, relationships that grow and change, and an oustanding cast of actors. Very well done!
0374275637|4.0|Great concepts. but the book bogs down in detail. I highly recomend the book but good luck getting trough the whole book
B004FQX5CK|4.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The blu-ray version of Blade Runner: Final Cut is superb.  Despite the fact that it is an older movie and shot primarily in lowlight conditions, details are sharp, colors are vibrant and blacks are deep.  While there is some film grain in certain scenes, it is soft rather than gritty.  It did not call attention to iself.  The sound was initially a little weak on my system, but I cranked it up a notch or two and then it sounded fine.  I highly recommend this blu-ray transfer.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is totally worth it.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|all around game play 5Star but crashed within 15min otherwise still hard to put down, a good game that's easy to play
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I have not read any books by Nicholas Sparks before, so this was a nice start. It is a love story but not overly mushy. I found myself hoping the two main characters would get together but glad that they took their time. Overall an enjoyable read even though it was not my normal choice for a sexy love story.I liked that it was not instant gratification with their love. Though the end was somewhat predictable it still had atwist you did not see coming.

B007ZI06FE|4.0|Have never read a so-called Steampunk novel and I loved this one. From what I have read it is a little different than some. I love paranormal novels even though this was not your typical vampire novel either.<br />The alternate historical view was interesting and the two main characters very likable in different ways. To understand everything Blade had gone through and still see the soft spot he had for his people was refreshing. His feelings for Honoria were evident from the beginning though he tried to fight them.<br />Honoria was a heroine after my own heart. She was stubborn and tough but willing to protect her family at all costs. She was willing to give herself to Blade to protect her family and this was something she never thought she could do.<br /><br />As the novel evolved the Honoria was the core of all the good and bad things that happened. The author describes the events that unfold wonderfully and you feel for each character and the tough decisions can must make along the way. I am a sucker for happy endings and cannot wait to read the next novel in the series.

0486414124|4.0|Though Northanger Abbey is not quite on the same level as say Pride & Prejudice or Emma, that should not stop any fan of Jane Austens' or just fans of old English literature from enjoying it.<br /><br />Here is a brief overview of the plot:<br />When young Ms. Catherine Morland goes to Bath with neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Allen, she goes to balls and parties, visits the pump room, and reads novels with her newly acquired friend, Isabella Thorpe.  While there, she makes the acquaintance of Mr. Henry Tilney and his sister, and is invited to stay with them at their family home of Northanger Abbey.  Reading gothic novels with Isabella has unfortunately made her imagination run wild, and Catherine starts to read too much into the cause of the late Mrs. Tilney's death, and is later cast out of the abbey by Henry's father.  She begins to regret all the false assumptions she has made, as she is now seperated from Henry; she is left to imagine what he thinks of her as she attempts to readjust to a sedentary life at her own home.<br /><br />After reading Sense & Sensibility, Pride & Prejudice and Emma, I at first was admittedly disappointed; I have since decided that was because if you start reading Northanger Abbey and expect it to be in the same style as her other books, this seems different, and thus not as good. Once I thought of Northanger Abbey as a completely seperate book, not even remotely connected with Austen's other novels, I really began enjoying it. The humour is more obvious here than in any of her other books, and I found myself laughing more often than ever before while reading an Austen story.<br /><br />By the way, if after reading the book, you feel the need to see it as a film, don't bother; Masterpiece Theatre's production leaves much to be desired, and though I have not seen BBC's, I don't have high hopes for it either.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is now one of my favorites; I sure am glad I gave it another chance.
B007XHWROK|5.0|I really enjoyed the disc. It is a wonderful example of modern pop music. I was not particularly a Justin Bieber fan but was interested in the most recent radio play and the cool production caught my attention. I do not any way regret my purchase of this album and it still in rotation in my car.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose 5 stars because it deserved it and because I always wanted to read more. I like this book because it is so captivating and you feel like you are in the book. I would recommend this book to people who like the social world, love, and adventure.

B007ZSBQYE|3.0|I drive many vehicles throughout the week, Semi Trucks, Front End Loaders, Side Skid Loader, Lift trucks, boom lifts, Dump trucks, High end sport cars, and my daily drivers, are Jeep Rubicon, Ford Excursion, and a Lincoln Navigator L, so I do allot of maneuvering, parallel parking, squeezing through tight spaces, driving on very uneven roads, ( rock climbing) so it is kind of frustrating, not being able to maneuver a little car on a screen that well, maybe I have finally met my challenge, I made it up to the jeep level, but I just stopped playing cause everything feels so unnatural, I know it's a phone game, so that is why It's a decent game, I will download it to my sons tablet, I think he may like it, It's just not for me, download it and give it a shot
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|I was enjoying this game very much until level 3-1, Lep falls every time the level starts even before the controls are on the screen, no way to get passed it. I'm sad to say I'm going to uninstall now, very disappointed!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This is a regular mass-market film, but with a lot of truth thrown in.  If you are expecting, or have kids, you and your spouse/partner will probably identify with at least one character.  The best part is that they showed that the experience is different for different people.  Not everyone can run a marathon the day before giving birth naturally and effortlessly, if they can even get pregnant, yet that's the expectation this culture puts on expectant moms.  By showing a range of experiences, the movie nicely says that one need not measure up, but simply take his/her own path.  Also good that this movie did not focus exclusively on women.  My husband would probably have appreciated this movie when we were expecting or new parents.<br /><br />If you are not a parent and have no present (or long-term) plans to be, some of the jokes and feelings may fall flat.  You may want to save it for a more relevant time in your life, or knock a star off the ratings.
B00985E3UG|4.0|A very informative book telling consumers just how little the industry thinks of the buying public and how they do everything underhanded to hook people on their products that they know are not good or healthy to be putting into our daily diet. The take away from this book is buy fresh, organic and stay away from processed foods and you will live a longer and healthier and happier life. Stop being manipulated by advertising and &#34;convenience&#34; foods for a busy family. You are never to busy to eat healthy and plan ahead so your family will live that long and healthy life. It does matter what goes into our bodies.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Its is a definite must see. Tom Cruise is awesome and shares the role generously with other cast members. This movie has a lot of action from beginning to end.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Quentin blows himself up in grand style in this one.  I love everything he does.  Another bloody masterpiece for sure
B00BESM14U|4.0|An intelligent young @ heart movie.  This movie made me nostalgic for the late 80's early 90's (which is not an easy task).  I thought that it was thought provoking and different from most independent films in that I was deeply moved by the surprise wrap up of the ending.  I would recommend this movie.
0802473156|5.0|I like this book, it is easy to read and understand.  It make sense that we are all wanted to be loved but perceived love expression in a different ways.  I think this should be a must read for every married couples and those in relationship.

B00B5AIB14|3.0|Kaya is with no doubt a classic album that has stood the test of time.  I was more than a little disappointed with this 35th Anniversary Deluxe Edition mainly because it pales in comparison to the other fantastic Marley Deluxe Editions.  The one bonus song is just another \\"version\\" of \\"Smile Jamaica\\".  We already have two other versions of that song on the Rastaman Vibration Deluxe edition.  The second cd may capture a good performance of the band but it sounds like crap.  It sounds as though it was mastered from a very weak audio source or poor recording device.  I really think that this is a money grab and at this price point we deserve better.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best action movies I have ever seen! I love movies, and at 55 years old I've seen a lot of them. I have been a Marvel fan since I was about 6 or seven years old. The Avengers are one of my favorite Super Hero Teams. Please do a great sequel and more individual movies of each one. Also, I'd love to see Mark do a series of Hulk movies.
6305128952|5.0|this is a good story-good plot-believable,very entertaining-in enjoyed it a lot-it came right on time,and was packaged well- old movies are the best
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Pretty good book. It was easy to get through and pretty short which is the kind of book I needed right now since I'm so busy with school. I loved Pats relationships with everyone. You could see a lot of love there and it was just a real feel good story. Of course there was a few sad parts. The only negative thing I can say is that there was something missing it wasn't a fabulous book. It was just readable. Possibly because I wanted to find out why he was the way he was. I read it because the previews for the movie were good and I want to see it. I started reading reviews and everyone was saying the book sucked in comparison to the movie. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I can totally see it being better.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I lost track of the number of times I picked to try to read this book.  The beginning was just a little slow, but with a coworkers encouragement to give it another chance, I did, and I loved it!  As you were reading you constantly had the feeling that there was more.  Life is far from perfect.  Thank you,  College Hoover, for letting the world know you can have a really messed up LIFE, and with the love of a friend or your family, you can be alright and happy!  To all the Sky's and Holder's of this world,hold on to the positive and the love of a friend/family.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If only kids had these mature attitudes towards tolerance, combined with a great sense of humor. I loved it because of the help each main character gave the other. I loved the sense of humor between the two main characters. A good story, respectful, as well as lustful, relationship.

B004742Y68|3.0|My husband and I recently watched Poltergeist again (his choice) after many years.  He had always been a bigger fan than I had but I watched it with him as I had nothing else in mind to do. This movie hasn't aged well. I really didn't find the characters likable. I am very picky about movies and usually like old classic movies best. This one just wasn't scary to me, it just seemed silly.

So good it is worth buying the disc.

1932100660|1.0|I received this as a \\"gift\\" from a new-found vegan.  Being a hunter, there is little a vegan hates more than a person who gets their own organic, free range and local meat, and who is absolutely healthy to every degree.  I did read the book.  I actually heard about it on a show my SO nagged me into watching.  The book, while being named \\"The China Study\\", only devotes about 1/3 of its pages to that study.  For most of the rest of the time, it preaches the vegan diet and blames just about every disease known to us (from cancer to AIDS, to being hit by lightning, or at least it seems this way) on meat and animal products.<br /><br />Yet, no evidence is presented to further this claim.  There is one animal study done on milk protein.  This study is then used as the basis in saying that ALL animal protein is the cause of all diseases.  Even if the milk study was reproduced and found to have validity, it would still not show that ALL animal-based proteins are the same.<br /><br />Next, being a food scientist, there are some claims that are made that just ring of vegan propaganda.  Claims that the wonder nutrient folic acid is only found in plant-based sources is just plain wrong.  Organ meats are several times higher in folate than the leading plant-based sources.  A nutritional scientist should not be making these types of mistakes unless there is another agenda on the table (be it selling books, promoting vegan-ism, trying to put the meat industry out of business, whatever, I am not accusing anyone, simply stating what I observed).<br /><br />Another interesting point to ponder is that in the actual \\"China Study\\", the raw data does not support the vegan diet as better than an animal-based one.  In fact, if the data is looked at without any \\"help\\", points to carbohydrates having several TIMES the impact on cancer as animal-based proteins.<br /><br />All this, and much else has caused me to not find any worth in actually paying for such propaganda.  Yes, I went into the book with a bias.  I am bias when ANYONE claims that something is the cause for ALL disease, or the something is directly linked to cancer, without actually proving a darn thing.  China was a great place to run this study as the numbers are easily manipulated.  Why was this study not run in a primarily vegetarian/vegan society and in a primarily carnivorous society?  Why does the author even say that the jump from milk-protein to all animal products was strictly on his own, without evidence, and then just leave it at that?  Why not explain how that \\"leap\\" was made?  Why not cite other reliable, non-bias sources that either validate or go against what the author hypothesizes?  Too many unanswered questions to take anything here seriously, other than the fact that it is veganist propaganda and not worth the tree that was cut down to print it.book with a bias.

Cannon Fodder!  Read this book and find out how the commanding officers in the military have no idea of what they are sending our men into.  Sitting where it is safe, is no way to lead.  The men who came back from Okinawa alive or maimed, certainly had battle stress the rest of their lives.<br />Eugene B.

Kudos to the developers for thinking this out so well.
1250012570|5.0|I am deeply and madly in love with Eleanor & Park. If polygamy wasn't illegal I would marry this book today. The book is so honest and brilliantly written that it vividly reminded me what it was like to fall in love for the first time. I cried and laughed. And then cried some more. When I finished the book I felt like I would never get over it.  Then I started re-reading it again. It is the type of book that changes you in a small but significant way.  Where the characters just become a part of you and capture a piece of your heart.  This is, without a doubt, one of my top favorite books of all time.

B006M9NJFG|5.0|A canteen is pretty simple but essential piece of equipment in the field. This unit has elevated ribs on it which make for a slightly heavier but more durable canteen then a standard issue US style one. The cooking tin on the bottom will most definitely prove useful in the boiling of questionable water and adds added protection while maneuvering through thick terrain. For the price and strength this is the best canteen I've ever owned.

B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Idea of fighting to the death for an unrealistic motive for games did not appeal to me. It turned the idea of a 'game' into an antiquated morality similar to gladiators in the lion's den arena during Roman times.

1451695195|5.0|I loved this book, read it in one sitting and felt like I could almost embody [in an inexplicable kind of way] what it was that he was trying to explain, in conveying his reality.  It is so magnificent, I was in an altered state.  It feels as though we all have this knowledge buried deep within and rarely accessible. I had originally purchased the book for my Mother who will be transitioning soon.  Years ago I had an out of body experience (appendix ruptured) but was not so fortunate to journey as far as he and many others have. It validates/explains quantum physics, how everything is connected, nothing is separate and everything that the Vedics and Masters have been saying for thousands of years.  I highly recommend it, the last few chapters are so good too, his scientific inquiry and validation. There are no accidents, everything is perfect just as it is, all is well.  Love is the answer.  OM
B005NFJAT4|5.0|This movie highlights some of the key skirmishes within this three day epic battle, that represents the high water mark of the confederacy and the turning point of the American Civil War.<br /><br />Not exactly a stellar cast, or an over-the-top epic Hollywood production.  However, the cast does a great job in their roles and the ability to gain so many re-enactors and weapons of that time for the major battle scenes is very impressive.<br /><br />Long on dialog of the machinations and relationships within the union and confederate headquarters and encampments in between battles helps to draw this film out at a bit of a slow pace.<br /><br />All told, this remains one of the top films made in regards to the American Civil War.
1939416019|1.0|This was an exceptionally frustrating book.  It was very well written in some aspects and the author shows great potential.  However the whole book takes place in 3 or 4 days.  During that time, our 14 year old hero, kills 2 monsters, saves the king, saves the king's oldest son, saves the hero of the country, makes best friends with the kings youngest son, gets adopted into the kings family and falls in love with the king's daughter.  Not to mention getting drunk twice, taking three 1/2 day to day long journeys, and beginning his training.<br /><br />I realize that any story with magic swords, monsters, dragons, etc. is not plausible by nature.  But this was beyond the ridiculous with all of it happening in such a short time.  Some wonderful characters were sketched out but no time was given to develop characters, freindships or rivalries.  One rivalrie is developed one day and fixed 2 days later.
B005HEPN06|4.0|Season 4 wraps up the Best of Both Worlds cliffhanger splendidly.  &#34;Family&#34;, &#34;The Drumhead&#34;, &#34;Reunion&#34;, &#34;The Wounded&#34;, &#34;Redemption&#34; are all solid episodes.  Some of the others are fun/entertaining also.

B0034G4P1W|5.0|I gave this movie to my nieces and nephews for Christmas. The sad but funny part about this is that I was the one watching the movie more than them. The dark humor is too funny to pass up. Only a sailor or those that have been out to sea will or could understand what is being said but before the cast is introduced fully.
0757302661|5.0|I read this book n thought it was bs since I was trying the exercises at home and I could really get in the &#34; hypno&#34; zone. But when the day came to give birth to my little one.. I wanted everything naturally and i redid the exercise...guess what?? It worked! It was a 20 min drive to the hospital and I made it without feeling a contraction even though the were there!! Did the same thing at the birthing center and the monitor was telling us there was contraction and long ones! I was in my zone and felt nothing. Of course when the pushing started it ended. But it works!
1476733953|5.0|Picked this up on the Kindle and loved it. Howey has created a rich world filled with believable and sympathetic characters to guide you. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that it's rare to find a writer who can both craft solid characters and a truly creative \\"what if?\\" I really recommend it. Hell, I'm buying a copy for a few friends who love Science Fiction. Definitely see this as a future classic.

B00BH413IG|5.0|Perhaps more than anyone playing the music, Craig Taborn's group somehow manages to thoroughly deconstruct the approach to jazz piano trio from the perspective of melody, harmony, and improvisation, while simultaneously remaining completely faithful to the tradition. Call it post-modern Bill Evans: on \\"Chants\\" Taborn, Cleaver and Morgan generally hew far closer to a lush quietude that you don't often find from ensembles featuring iconoclasts such as Cecil Taylor or Misha Mengelberg, yet there's no denying their virtuosity and total command of all styles of music, including avant-garde classical and free jazz.  Commendably, Chants strikes an enviable balance in capturing so many moods, dynamics and beautiful songs, and by the end of the 55 minutes one is left with the impression that this trio can play pretty much anything!

0062059963|5.0|My Thoughts: I loved loved loved The Selection. It was one of my favorites of the year! And I remember yelling at the end of the novel because I wanted the next one right than! I was so happy to get to read The Elite! Whohooo!<br /><br />We are back with America. The competition to win Maxon's heart is now down to just six girls and the stakes are getting high. Each one wants him for her own reasons. Poor America is more torn than ever. She really does enjoy Maxon's company but she also still has feelings for her dear old Aspen who just happens to be around a lot.<br /><br />At times I wanted to smack Maxon. I could understand why he did some of the things he did but still. At times he would come off as sweet as pie, and then he would do something mean and I just hated it. Two sides to every story, right? I saw a few sides of him I didn't know existed. And, Aspen, he finally has a mission. He likes being a soldier. But he still wants to be with Mer too.<br /><br />I liked all the girls left in the competition. They each had their own strengths and weaknesses. They all wanted to win for one reason or another and America sure did have some challenges ahead of her.<br /><br />America also finds out more about her country and the rebels are out to get something inside the walls. They keep invading leaving everyone hurt and scratched up! America finds out stuff she doesn't really enjoy knowing and it could get her into some serious trouble.<br /><br />I love the characters, I love the plot, I love the clothes, I love all the girls, I love the guys, I love everything and everyone!<br /><br />The Elite was just as wonderful as the first. I was swept away in all of its beauty again. I know you either hate or love this series and for me, its a love. But, I also felt like The Elite wasn't quite as good as The Selection. I just felt like nothing really got accomplished or settled. Yes, we did learn more about the characters but I'm ready for some nonstop action and to see who she ends up with!<br /><br />If you loved The Selection, you'll probably enjoy this one. If you hated it, probably not.<br /><br />I don't want to say much else! Get the novel and devour it soon! Eat it up for breakfast, lunch, or supper. Either way, its gonna be good!<br /><br />Overall: Loved this one! I am so anxious for the next novel in this series. I hate that we have to wait so long! I must know what happens and I must know where America ends up and with whom! I need to know now!<br /><br />Oh Maxon, Oh Aspen, how to ever choose?<br /><br />Cover: Love it! Another pretty dress. I love the colors and how pretty she looks!

0670026603|5.0|My Thoughts: The reason I love Goodreads is that I find new books that I would have never found otherwise. I saw this pop up on my feed and someone raved about it, so I had to find out more. I went to the summary and it sounded like an interesting read so I had to pick it up.<br /><br />We are introduced to Lou who has just been let go at her job. She still lives at home with her family and she needs a job to earn money. She ends up working a job for a man who is paralyzed from a little above the stomach down. His name is Will. Before his accident, he was a really active person and happy. He had everything going on. Now he's confined to the live he has to live now. He isn't happy. And he makes everyone else miserable too. When Lou starts the job, she doesn't know if she can do it, care for him.<br /><br />But Lou doesn't give up. She strives on and tries to deal with everything the best she can. What choice does she really have? Lou and Will. Loved them. They talk. They get to know one another. They annoy each other, they irritate each other. But they also make eachother laugh.<br /><br />I seen so many sides of Will. I fell for him. I wanted and needed him to be happy. I loved Lou as a character. I also loved all the side characters and what they added to the mix.<br /><br />I loved this book, even though it was heartbreaking at times. I felt tears running down my face. But I also laughed during it. This was probably one of the best books I've read so far in 2013.<br /><br />I don't read too many Adult books anymore. I tend to read more Young Adult. But this one= wow!<br /><br />A unique heartbreaking story. I recommend it to everyone. Please add this to your To Be Read Pile now!<br /><br />Overall: Great!!! I don't even know how to describe this. I just want all my friends to read it and talk about it with me. I want to hear and know their thoughts. Amazing characters and an amazing story.<br /><br />Cover: Like it. It's plain yet appealing enough to make you wonder what it is about.<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes<br />_______<br />Taken From Princess Bookieer what it is about.<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes<br />_______<br />Taken From Princess Bookie

1476712042|4.0|My Thoughts: I had heard so many good and bad reviews for this one, I wasn't sure what I would think going in. When I read bad reviews, I try not to let it taint my thoughts. So many thoughts on this one.<br /><br />I won't write a hundred page review on this one, its been said before, it will be said again.<br /><br />We are introduced to Abby who comes from an awkward family. Her dad is pretty intense and I can see why Abby wanted to get away for college, to reinvent herself. She also has a best friend named America who knows all about her past.<br /><br />She's a freshman at college and she meets a guy named Travis. Everyone knows Travis. He's a man-whore. Every night he takes home a different girl and doesn't bother calling them afterward. He's got tattoos, fights, rides a motorcycle, about as bad boy as you can get.<br /><br />Travis and Abby's relationship gets off to a rough start. They are just friends but find themselves feeling more than they are supposed to for one another. They had a rocky relationship and they go back and forth a lot. Travis brings home different girls, and Abby is also seeing a guy named Parker.<br /><br />I don't know what to say about this one. It was intense. It was crazy. It was dramatic. But I liked it. Travis was emotional, and at times the relationship wasn't perfect and could be viewed at a bit abusive. I loved Travis as a character though (minus being overprotective) and I could see why he was the way he was. He was sweet but bad-ass. I couldn't help but like him even though he has many traits I'd like to throw out the window.<br /><br />I did love the dynamic of Travis's family. I could see myself fitting in with a bunch of guys like Abby did. I also liked the way Abby took in his family. She understood, she got it. She felt it.<br /><br />I can see why people hate this one, I really can. At times, I would get frustrated, but I went into it with an open mind and tried to see it for what it was. It wasn't perfect, the characters weren't perfect, the plot wasn't perfect but it was real. It was gritty and rough around the edges. Travis wasn't perfect, far from it, but he had real emotions and he let them show.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed reading this one, and I'll read Walking Disaster just to see what its like.<br /><br />Overall: I enjoyed it. Not quite a 5 cupcake rating but I liked it enough to want to know what happened, and I stayed up until 4 in the morning to read it.<br /><br />Cover: It's ok. It doesn't really draw me in like covers usually do that I want to read.<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 4/5 Cupcakes<br />_____________<br />Taken From Princess Bookiers weren't perfect, the plot wasn't perfect but it was real.

B00AO7HQ06|5.0|I was surprised and delighted to find songs by Duane Allman that I've never heard.  These include his studio performances which I thought we had heard all of on his anthologies.  There are many more which were not on the Anthology albums that are great songs.  I am well pleased to find these songs.  Of course there's some familiar ones but I found the collection well worth it.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|to begin with I must say I am frustrated with the limitations of mp3 playback in conjunction with this particular piece of music. having grown up with it on an LP I find the pause between tracks rather annoying and interrupt the flow.  that being said this is one of the premere albums of the 1970s and stands the test of time as truly classical work it will outlive its makers and its listeners into several new generations.
B0095P31L6|4.0|I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was not impressed, neither was my family. I didn't and still don't feel this a good feature for children. After watching it a second time, alone, without my Dad hat on, I found it to be much more entertaining.

I'm finishing now with &#34;Red Country&#34; and hoping Mr. Abercrombie will be putting out another book soon. I've thoroughly enjoyed them all and certainly consider his writing and story telling a cut above. Great characters, good stories and writing that satisfies. Do yourself a favor, start with the First Law trilogy and enjoy.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I just Love, Love, Love this film. It was an assault on my senses and I enjoyed every second, (rewind) give me more.
B00BBI9WD6|3.0|A fun easy read.  More space fantasy than Sci Fi.  The novelty being the story revolving around a strong female commander.  This book is part of a series.  I enjoyed it for what it was, but it doesn't entice me to pursue any more books in the series.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|Catch-22 has become more than just a great work of literature; I think it can be considered Americana. Heller perfectly captured not only the madness and hypocrisy of war, and the military, but also of the timeless quality of American life. Looking at myself, and my contemporaries, I can see all of faults and failures reflected in the gallery of characters Heller populates his novel with.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a solid game from the very first screen. Everything about TR2 screams '$9.99', but it's FREE!!! As a core gamer for many years, this is definitely better than freeware.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This was a very good Clancy book. TC (and Greany) mix different plots well, weaving them together into a good story. I didn't love Locked On (book 3 in the series) because it was somehow not authentic. Threat Vector doesn't have that problem - Clancy finally figured out how to handle his aging veterans, merging them with modern technology and a younger cast.<br /><br />The title of the book, and the main plot, refers to the different ways that nations (or terrorists) can attack. In this case, most of the warfare is cyber-warfare, as a mysterious character called &#34;Center&#34; wages an electronic war against the US (and The Campus where Jack Junior works).<br /><br />The usual suspects are around (Jack Junior, Ding Chavez, Mary Pat Foley, John Clark, etc) and their roles feel pretty realistic.<br /><br />This is about a 4.5 star book. I hope Clancy can keep his groove going for the next one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fun game for your kid. With daily and weekly tasks you kids will be very busy trying to finish them. It's a very good app for your kid.
0307749347|2.0|I'm sure he's a nice and smart man but his recording is just too tedious to listen to, for more than one reason.  I listened to about a third of the recording because I was getting a little out of the research he quoted, but when he intimated that the mind can produce weight loss, I threw in the towel.  The actual book may possibly be easier to take and might also let the reader filter content better...skip pages.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the book,the suspense,the excitement,the love , omg I have read and reread this book 7 times just to know that Elena gets hers and that he admits to loving her and then the marriage, but I feel he had a lot of lies and the best when he admitted to giving his ex a bath after he made Anastasia leave, I couldn't even eat I was so crazy .
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|This movie does not represent the story, &#34;The Hobbit.&#34; For anyone who read and loved the book, this movie will be disappointing at best and downright offensive for most. The repeated, ill-placed drug references were absurd and without point or context. It was shocking to see this tale so poorly done after the Lord of the Rings trilogy was so masterfully presented. I am sorry to have wasted any money watching this film and will avoid the remaining sequels.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Great plot, intriguing characters, fantastic twists.  My new favorite novel - I'll read more of her work.  Some people were disappointed in the ending.  I understand their point; I originally wanted it to turn out differently.  But upon reading I felt it was better, and more poetic, the way it was written.  Well done.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is without doubt one of the best made television series of all time, and that it was cancelled after only one season is unfathomable.  The production value is excellent.  The writing is uniformly top-notch.  The direction is superb.  The acting is world-class.  This is one of only a few series where the cast hits the ground running, as if the viewer is truly dropping in on the middle of a longer-running story.  In my experience this only happens rarely.  I'm a huge star trek fan and I'll be the first to admit the early episodes in virtually every series show evidence of characters who are still finding their place in relation to others.<br /><br />I didn't see Firefly when it aired - I first heard about it after the new Battlestar Galactica mini-series came out, and a friend said, &#34;did you notice Serenity in the opening scenes?&#34;  After &#34;What's Serenity?&#34; I learned about this series, that my friend said &#34;I have three copies of the DVD's.  One for myself, one to loan out, and one 'just in case'.&#34;  Well, now I've owned five of these sets, two of which have gone to new homes after loaning out to people who fell in love with it.<br /><br />The packaging has greatly improved.  The first several sets I bought had a separate plastic case for each of the four DVD's.  Now it comes in one box with multiple disc holders.<br /><br />Bottom line:  if you like science fiction, shows that are well written, and characters with depth, I guarantee you will love this show.  If you don't, contact me & I'll buy the DVD's from you :)
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|The Following has a plot full of suspense and great actors to deliver it.

Kevin Bacon plays a hero that you almost hate to root for and James Purefoy plays a villain you almost hate to root against. Both give you a sense that no one is purely good or purely evil. I recommend  this series to anyone who is a fan of crime thrillers as it will hook you right away.
0374531269|4.0|A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier by Ishmeal Beah is a recollection of events seen through the eyes of a child who witness a normal life and was stripped of his innocence by the of war and unrest. Ishmael takes us on a journey through the eyes of a child and later on through the eyes of a child soldier. The realities of civil unrest and violence are present in Sierra Leon, as this story was told and as we followed the character developing throughout the story. A globalized and feminist lens does indeed shape the way we see this narrative. For one, we can see that global impact of civil unrest in Africa and the certain involvement of countries that get involved to stop such conflicts. Secondly, we see how woman play a vital role in society as the sole nurturer of the family and the back bone for emotional support. Unfortunately, the civil unrest has taken a toll on woman as a result of rape as villages and towns become raided with rebels. Can involvement in efforts to help those affected in civil unrest in war torn countries bring about unneeded diplomatic interventions and foreign policy?  If so, we can see how many countries have their stake in involvements in other countries affairs. It can be that those war torn countries have high valued resources that are needed globally.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's addicting. The gameplay isnt choppy, but it's far from flawless. There is the occasional 1/2 second freeze. As well, mojang, or whoever is on pocket edition won't update it enough.<br /><br />But, it's still worth it.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|When will they make this thing into a movie? That's what I keep asking myself all these years. I think Drizzt is a very likeable character. I fell in love with him and loved reading about all his struggles. That's what makes this book memorable for me.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is pretty cool and very fun.You grow different things to attract different fish.Everything is very vibrant in colors.You collect algae and sand dollars from the things you grow. I downloaded this game yesterday and I'm already on level 10! Great game to play for kids or adults.I would recommend this to anyone.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Very surprised at how good this movie was. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Of course, there's a loophole in the story line when it comes to time travel.*****SPOILER ALERT*****  If he blows himself away when he's young, then he could never be old and come back into his past. *****END SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />Despite that inconsistency, it still made for a great movie and a great idea.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game is fun and easy to play.it is very beautiful, but the only downside is you have yo spend real money for pearls and the time to grow everything
B007J4T2G8|3.0|So, I started reading this book and couldn't put it down, it was obviously that good. So why only 3 stars? you're probably wondering. For the following reasons:<br /><br />1. I'm not a fan of romance novels. The definition of a romance novel to me is one where the sex takes precedence over the story line. You read the book for the elaborately written sex scenes, basically. This book most definitely fits that category. I bought it because all the raving reviews made me think it would be different, but it wasn't. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I can't seem to get into book 2, because it's about the sex...again, and I like to read books for their good story lines with sex coming in secondary to that.<br /><br />2. Ana has NO personality. And I definitely need to emphasize the &#34;no&#34; on this. She rarely makes more than a few words to a short sentence when she has speaking parts. How in the world anyone could find her interesting enough to pursue, is not possible. Hence, the author reverts to what I feel is an overused, lame excuse. &#34;There was just something about her...&#34;<br /><br />3. Christian Grey is too domineering for my tastes. In the bedroom is one thing, but commands to eat, sit, stand, and whatever else prevail throughout the book. He could use a little more personality himself.<br /><br />4. The author fails to elaborate and articulate in her writing style. Many times, professional critics can't seem to overlook this, but readers can because we aren't professional critics. We either like a book or not. However, there were many times where there was too much redundancy in the way things were described, even for me. She could have asked friends for help on that part, or used a thesaurus more often, or read other books to get inspiration on how to describe things in different ways.<br /><br />So, the book was good enough, overall, for me to not be able to put it down. But I can't give it anything higher than three stars because I feel that many of the cons I pointed out are large enough problems within the book to take away from a five-star rating.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|I had never really listened to Pink Floyd. This is a fantastic album. You can really get lost in the music
B00B671VYU|2.0|If a dude was in the basement of a backwater county's phone offices and used a rotary phone to call up a cell phone which was ducktaped to another rotary phone, which was set on a timer to at that very moment dial a third phone which was in the bargain bin of a bunch of Boost Mobile phones, then that guy who made the initial could would be phoning it in less than Lordi is on this album.<br /><br />I typically love Lordi, but this album is not a thing for loving. it is a thing for being sad you purchased because it doesn't even come close to touching Arockalypse, Deadache, Babez for Breakfast, or a wet, eggy fart overheard in line at KFC. In fact, the wet fart would be more entertaining, I think.<br /><br />Why, then, does it have 2 stars instead of 1? Because this is Rhianna. Only that shrew gets 1 star. Suck it, Rhianna.
B004ZN9NCY|5.0|My husband is a musician and loves to hear Pink Floyd he often plays along with the music. It's Awesome
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Look. If you like melodic hooks, perhaps out of place metal riffs and punk elements strewn throughout your music, you'll like this. If you don't, you won't.<br /><br />Every one of Volbeat's albums since their first has been at essentially the same level of quality and this is no different. It's good if you like ditties and you also like metal sometimes, but not all the time. Who doesn't like happy ditties and also metal sometimes but not all the time? Also, Caggiano is a wlecome addition. Now there are guitar solos. If you don't like those, I assume you're 84 years of age or older, and if that's the case, how are you even managing to read this? Isn't it your bed time? Bro, do you even internet? You don't get that, do you? No, I don't think you do. Have a prune and watch recorded instances of Rockin New Years Eve on your Beta Max.<br /><br />On a personal note, Lola Montez is such a delightful song that I squealed with glee as it played. I was alone in a car. And I squealed because of fun. Do you want to squeal with fun noises? Buy it.
B001O03NCW|5.0|This is one of my favorites.  I love the stories told in that &#34;Old Timey&#34; songs.  Would recommend this album to anyone who also enjoys this type of music.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Great story lines and excellent acting. The actors are so well matched, and the English humor of Sherlock is just delicious. His sidekick, Watson is superbly played, and the banter between the two main characters adds so much to the great storylines. Excellent plots, writing and acting. One of my favorites.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I truly enjoy the music. A nice combo of tunes makes listening a pleasure.<br />I love the show and have learned so much about the process of song writing and the lives of those in the business in Nashville.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Great show with great character interactions. Interesting plots while staying on the light side of gory. The love affair between Beckett and Castle add an interesting new twist.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great realistic game.  can't wait to get more horses. the animation is amazing.  it is addictive and I can't  wait to play everyday.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Like a good mystery story? With an entertaining ending?<br />Add a great adventure, and a very realistic portrayal of a boy and a Bengal tiger surviving on a lifeboat, and you have a great movie. Wrapped up inside this movie, with more than enough action to keep our attention, is the question of a search for the meaning of God, in a way that even the most devout (of any religion) can accept and learn from.<br />I'm not giving out any spoilers, which would be so easy in discussing the conflicts in the film, but it's clear that this coming-of-age story has enough going on to keep both teens and adults entertained, and that's on the small screen.<br />We missed it in theaters, but even on our small 32\\" in SD we were completely caught up in the story. If you've got a large HD TV, you're in even better luck, since the astonishing life-like special effects and the glorious scenery will keep you glued to the set.<br />Pre-teens may cringe at the accurate portrayal of wild animal behavior, but it's little more than any one could see on a National Geographic special, and is entirely in keeping with reality. I mean, there are no talking animals, and they are not \\"humanized\\" in any fashion. A tiger is a tiger is a tiger, in other words.<br />The color is vivid, the nature scenes are real, the story line is very appealing (based on true events), and the acting is more than one might expect, and there is one surprise cameo appearance for French film aficionados.<br />Prepare to be enchanted.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I love this combo pack!!  my son uses the Bluray and my daughter uses the standard Dvd - it's perfect!
6304936362|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have. I watch it all the time. They should all be this realistic.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Super great movie. Really enjoyed. It had all the right components to make a fantastic movie. I am looking forward to the next one.
B004GXZ69W|1.0|I've had two of these in a year. One lasted from November to March, before the cord broke and stopped receiving from the computer. One lasted from March to today before the button fell off. And they're far, far too expensive to be disposable like that.<br /><br />Did using it make my hand hurt less? Yes. But the construction on these things is terrible.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|All I can say is beware! This series is very addicting, as was 1 and 2, and you will probably spend way too much time in front of the TV.  And then it's over until season 4...oh the pain of waiting for that.
B0063IH60K|4.0|An interesting pastime.  I really like it.  Thank you very much.  I'll recommend it to my friends and family members..
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|good game but too quickly finished. graphics were good. wasn't free though. wished it stated that it was a trial for free.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Beautifully shot and all around intriguing series.  I was very skeptical at first, but watch one episode and see if you do not get hooked.
0679424741|5.0|I read Carson McCullers, &#34;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&#34; long ago.  It did not disappoint as a re-read!  This hard cover book was once a library book, its in beautiful shape and arrived on time.
B00867GJYK|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. Arrived on time and in great shape. Its great for all ages. Shark Bait Hoohaha!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its so addictive all of the games make me feel competitive my cousin and I compete to get the highest score
B004DLPXAO|5.0|If you have Apple and Android devices, Kindle should be your reader.  So much easier than trying to keep up with a book. At home, I use my IPad to read but on the road my android phone becomes my reader and works great. I really like are the way Kindle reminds me where I stopped reading on the other device and asks if I would like to jump to where I stopped on that device. On my android phone the words are large and clear enough for me to easily read.  Kindle is a wonderful program. Thanks for making my reading take anywhere-anytime enjoyment.<br /><br />Sorry, I haven't found anything to dislike at this point.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I loved this one as much as the first. Another page turner and I like how almost each character has traits one admires and loves and some to despise and dislike. Now off to Book number three :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OMG the book is absolute hots<br />It's amazing how much they love each other e even if it was all a act
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The show is interesting and a good watch. One of the better shows on tv it is at least one show my wife like that I can stand to watch
B0047T86G0|1.0|This (old) but brilliant book was sold out of date. It did not even have a contents page. So if one wanted a word comencing with say the letter P one would have to wade through a thousand pages. University Press,the Dictionary's publishers ,told me that  Amazon knew that perfectly well the situation. Is this the first sign that Amazon is getting too big for its library and that customers are becoming a nuisance. At the same time Amazon's profit on P&P  is making in some cases more profit than on the item. Get a grip Amazon and remember your beginnings.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I switched to accuweather because more often then not the weatherbug app was inaccurate and slow to update.<br />very happy with the accuweather app.
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|Thankfully I got this game free because it isn't worth a penny. It is in NO way realistic.  The car drives like a brick. Don't waste your time on this one...even if it is free!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I ran into this amp in an article about improving mic sound into dslr's. I thought to myself , i never heard of a headphone amp.  I decided to give it a shot, if it didnt help reduce background noise during recording at least I could use it as a headphone amp since I do use them a lot. Well turns out I can barely tell the difference in my audio recordings, but in headphone sound is a differnt story.  Here is what I found.  Volume increases an average of at least 30% giving you that extra boost when you just want to drown out your surroundings.  I didnt really notice too much of a difference in the overall quality of the sound.  The absolute best thing about the Fiio E6 is the bass boost setting. Holy crap.  thats exactly what some headphones need. I listen to electronic music mainly dubstep and man does it bring the bass.  The Fiio somehow transforms your headphones, it brings the best out of them but performs no miracles.  Crank it with cheap $5 earbuds and it just gets all distorted.  I have a pair of damsung earbuds that came with my smarphone, they sound acceptable but lack bass and sound tinny. Hook it up to the Fiio and put on hass boost. wow. what a difference, huge improvement in bass and highs, no distortion. on over the ear headphones like my sennheiser eh150 it brings the volume and power that i get when listening from my receiver.  Build quality is good, i like that you get an extra clip in case you snap one.  One of my aux cables had a short but it came with 2 so no biggie.  This thing is awesome.  The only thing im wondering is, howcome I never heard of theese devices before? why cant I find them among the hundreds of headphones in the headphone isle?  instead of spending money and time finding those perfect headphones, chances are if you hook up a fiio to the ones you have now, you will finally love the way they sound.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|This film leaves me awestruck. Watch and wonder<br /><br />What is left behind by a seeker?  Does it carry the language of a mere novel?  Or is  something more virtuous being communicated?  Have our senses become so numb from a continuous stream of junk food to the extent we can't leave the behind drooling expectation of another fleshy climax.  So many would like a scripture to conform to their relative position.  Should we become like the Supreme or should it bow before us?  Malick's work refuses to bow to our minds.<br />Strive we do to merge into another's body or mind.  To find some meaningful contact, to find love.  Are we capable of finding this in the temporary flesh?  At the end of the day we all wish to to find release, liberation from this maya.  Will another object free us?
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Although I have not finished the book, I know that it IS a life-changing event to be reading it AND I'M SO GRATEFUL for it!!!
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|I love this product.  It really helped me get close up with my mega zoom Coolpix Nikon p510.  Amazing product
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Yes, I'm a 36 year old women who is addicted to the mortal instrument series. I'm finishing the third book right now. I loved City of Bones and recommended it to several ladies that I work with. They all enjoyed it as well. I'm excited for the movie to come out this fall.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though we all know the ending, at least historically, this movie still keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The story moves briskly but still maintains depth.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Leonard Cohen is a great lyricist and musician, and he surrounded himself with excellent musicians for this concert in London.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This family is a fun nod to my generation of gamers.  Grownups will get nostalgic seeing pac man and sonic on the big screen.  Clean, entertaining humor for kids.
B00AVIKMN6|5.0|This movie is one of the ultimate in fantasy movies. The story of the vampires, lycans, and human sides of the war is an interesting plot. I love how the story brings together each world vividly and how the war effects them. The tragedy of Lucian's vampire lover being burned alive by her father was an eye opener and helped to explain Lucian's story.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|I ordered this movie to share with my boyfriend's 25 yr old daughter because she had never seen it.  Bees are crucial to our eco-system and so many people are oblivious to this fact.  These creatures are not to be feared, but worshiped!
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|It's strange that Joe Wright rips off his own movie, Pride and Prejudice so very much.<br /><br />Those are the best parts.  The rest is people making glances at each other for 45 straight minutes.<br /><br />Ughhhh!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love it & find it very helpful when I'm reading or playing a game.  You can find out instantly how much battery life is left.  I would recommend this app to everyone....
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Initially my son did not take to pacifiers at all, but I did not want him to be a thumb sucker.  So I bought this at 4 months old and almost tossed it.  Decided to keep it and BOY am I glad I did!! He goes everywhere with monkey.  At night, if he wakes, he'll cry a bit and tos around and he can find him so much easier than a plain pacifier and plop him right back in his mouth for a good nights rest.  He loves \\"monkey\\" and so do we!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a very inspiring trilogy...each book is unique and entertaining.  I found it hard to put it down, it was easy reading...
B00081912E|5.0|I'm not sure if I ordered new or used but the DVD is in new condition. We love the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book takes off right where Hunger Games left. It isn't like other trilogies that kinds of taper off, this series keeps you going!
B000V39KDO|5.0|What can I say, this is my favorite movie.  Gerard is superb and the scenery just gets better from there.<br />Finally history that appeals to women and can be viewed as often as I like.
B004UHL9EK|3.0|I love the ability to customize multiple timers and alarms.<br /><br />I wish that this app would update the countdown timer in the status bar.<br />It never acts right when the timer hits *ZERO*, Either the screen never wakes up, or when it goes off while I have my headphones on, the sound increases and blast my eardrums out. Sometimes when I stop the timer, it restarts on it's own.<br /><br />Please fix these issues.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE this website! It enables me to find the recipes and ideas that I have seen and liked in a way that is fast and easy. Saves on paper, too!
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|If you’re a Pat Metheny fan, or if you just like jazz quartet’s, or really appreciate great musicianship, you should love this.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a very interesting game. Each level is more challenging than the last.  I sometimes have a hard time putting it down!
B000GW8RX4|5.0|It’s great to see Rainbow in action and with Dio, who is no longer with us, and Cozy Powell, also no longer with us, it is a treasure to have this on DVD.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom never disappoints, and 'The Time Keeper' is no different. Just like the others, this book really makes you think about life on a totally different level. Once I started reading it, I couldn't stop and I actually finished the book in one night. It's a fairly short and easy read with a lot of quotes worth highlighting. Love it and will read it again.
030758836X|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this book.  I am turned off by authors who believe swearing is the only way to get your attention.  I liked the story and plot.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|I have always loved this movie and I am so glad that I have it on DVD now! This movie cracks me up!
B00000K0DQ|5.0|I've seen this movie several times, but returned to it for the first time in a long time last night.<br /><br />Robbins, I think, understood that if he was going to make an effective movie about the death penalty, he had to take the arguments of death penalty proponents honestly.  And he couldn't shortchange them.  And he doesn't.  The pain the parents of the victims feel is real.  And the crime that starts it all is not forgotten.<br /><br />What surprised me re-watching the movie is how deeply religious the film is.  It's hard to imagine you could miss it in a movie about a nun, but this might be one of the most deeply religious movies ever made.  Tucked inside this movie about the death penalty is a movie about forgiveness.  And the movie doesn't shortchange that, either.  It's easier to forgive sins in the abstract; sins against others.  And the movie acknowledges that.  But at the end of the day comes down solidly on the power of forgiveness and necessity of coming to terms with sins against us for peace of mind in our own lives.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have played almost every HO/Adventure game available for Kindle Fire and this one ranks in the top five.  With 3 levels of difficulty to choose from, lots of scenes and mini-games, and a well developed storyline, you will be entertained for hours on end.  I highly recommend this one.  More like this, please!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I recommend this book to who ever enjoys history, mythology and book nerds such as myself I intent to read all of the Percy Jackson series´. (Including the Heroes of Olympus series) This book was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0988178532|5.0|From the moment I pick up the book I have been on a journey into an exciting and suspenseful world.  My mind was opened to so many possibilities that never really occurred to me.  LOVE how Legg put his vision down so that you can not only imagine what is going on, but at times even feel it!!  I cannot wait for the 2nd book!!  This is a Must read!!
B005H9B44A|5.0|&#34; I need a HORSE!&#34;--Thor<br />&#34;All we have are cats and dogs&#34;--pet store clerk<br />&#34; Then give me one of those big enough to ride&#34;--Thor<br /><br />Hilarious great movie
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I loved the little clip about Peter tearing up the postage receipt.  It was great video to keep the elevator door opening on every floor as Alisa & Will went up to the Presidental Suite.  This show brings in the most interesting court cases.  How the lawyers handle the situations is great.  I recommend  it to all my friends.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|This is a very good and thorough retrospective of a great artist. I am really enjoying it. came in good shape and timely.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I love this app! It's an easy to use glitch tool!<br />My friends and I would recommend this to ANYBODY who plays minecraft.
B0034G4P1W|1.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie. The characters look great, and for the first 10 - 15 minutes or so, it is fairly entertaining. After that, it becomes an unbelievable slog to get through the movie. The characters are extremely annoying, boring, and repetitive. The movie seemed like it was 3 hours long - just from curiousity, I fast forwarded the rest of the movie after hitting yet another tediously annoying bit ... and it went on and on and on .... Definitely glad we just rented this one.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very possible to see events such as these actually happening.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an action packed story.
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|Excellent album for those who want their classical music both relaxing and inspired.  I believe the melodies and driving energy of the music is unique and very engaging.
B004DP9QFS|5.0|Awesome apps day & night times, this Amazon America site can't buy, Maestro card don't work. I searched google & found android apps in Amazon UK & download my mobile is worked can buy with my Maestro card :-).<br />Much better than Google Play website no Meastro card can't buy.
B0000C1HLF|5.0|This is an old movie I watched the first time in 2006. These three angels were very cool. The price is very low if you search hard enough on Amazon for bargain movies. 5-star is rated.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This was the first relax/sleep aid app I downloaded , I have since tried others, but I always come back to this one, it seems to work best for me
B00785P2QC|4.0|Only problem with the game is too expensive for investment points, and if you like to play the game at faster then a snail's pace to acquire enough points....you have to spend money for small amounts.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it! From my first game I was hooked.  I found challenging without be frustrating.  I recommend this to my fellow OCD-ers.
B008J34466|5.0|Another great album....she never ceases to amaze!  Strength, dignity and a sense of humor - what better role model can we have for our girls?
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Having become somewhat bored with the Angry Birds games I already had this one is a bit of a challenge and shakes up the status-quo.
B008NW67E0|4.0|I knew I had to get this after the Grammy awards show.  I saw them and enjoyed their performace so much so I purchased this.  I love the first 5 or so songs but then the ending ones not so much.  I am still glad I bought this especially for the &#34;I will wait for you&#34; song.
0345529057|5.0|Perfectly packaged, this collection of books offers an outstanding way to relax and enjoy your leisure time.I highly recommend it.
B000002KKC|5.0|I have everything from Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks.  They are my all time favorite group.  I purchased this CD because I still have the original vinyl and wanted it for my car.  This is one of the best!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I get on Pinterest every evening as I watch television. I have soooooo much saved for my rainy day! I also love all the recipe ideas I have been collecting. I absolutely love the way I can create individual boards making it easier to find my saved pins at a later time.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The music is different then what has been out there for quite a while but I like it.  There are a few songs I am not fond of, but this happens with most CD's.  Overall, I love it.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I like the way Kathy Reichs uses today's issues in her novels.  The interaction between characters is refreshing.  I hope that Brennan and Ryan can get back together.
B009NPA3MS|4.0|The first time I heard &#34;Home&#34; I knew I had to have this CD.  I purchased it and am very happy with it.  I love listening to bluegrass type songs once in a while.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|vehicles glitch when you get into all the hard levels.  The game is other wise not bad.  A few more levels would be nice.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Best movie and books ever!<br /><br />This is one of the best story lines I have ever read where the movie pretty much follows the book. I thoroughly enjoyed<br />These movies. I would love to see more from J.K. Rowling.
0547569653|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It’s inspirational, informative and enjoyable, although, it may not be to everyone's taste (no pun intended).  I enjoy a vegetarian lifestyle and compete in Ironman and marathon events, I shared in the highs and lows experienced by the author.  The big test is to see how long I last before I read it again!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Why have I not seen this show before?  Love the triangle between Alicia, Will, and Peter!  I'm not sure who should win Alicia's love!!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I'm a list maker, catalog-er, note taking, memo making, journal keeping kind of person and this app is great. I love being organized and being able to find my things when I need them (who doesn't?). This app provides that. You can make as many notebooks as you want, they can be as many pages as you specify. You title the cover and then you can title individual pages. It has a handy search feature allowing you to look for specific words within your notebook. Your allowed to sort the notebooks by title and/or date. The format can be changed to pdf documents and you can password lock the app. You are given the option of either lined or unlined pages and they have various covers to give your bookshelf more flavor. Overall the app is great, functional and very User friendly. Wonderful for all the note takers, journal keepers and those just looking for a place to jot a few things down. Especially considering that fact that your getting it all free.

B004I8WD6E|3.0|This is my second one of these cases purchased. Offers solid protection for iPhone 4s. One of few very clear TPU cases available, but over time, these cases turn yellow and dingy, that is the only reason for getting a new one. Fits perfectly, and circular pattern on back is nice, could do without Amazon Basics name on the back.
1439181780|5.0|My mother recommended this book to me and not only did I enjoy reading it but have purchased several copies to give to friends.  Thank you for your prompt shipping and service
B008WCP2PG|1.0|I knew when I rented it that it was only going to be for the hot men and Channing's dancing. Imagine my horror when there was really very little of either! The premise was \\"meh\\", the plot was bad and the acting was some of the worst I've seen from all of these men. It's like being in the movie just sucked all of the talent out of them! Channing danced his a$$ off in his amazing way, but not enough to keep me watching the movie. I just turned it off with 20 minutes left because I actively disliked the characters and realized I could care less what happened to them. If you just HAVE to watch/buy it, I suggest turning off the volume completely.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm glad I'm the first of my friends to read this. Now I get to show it to everyone! :D
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I can't accept I don't know more about who he's writing to and his shuttle hints to explain things rather than actually saying them. I didn't know where the book was going but very relative and personal and the ending gave me closure.
B00AIJP9BS|5.0|just like the title of this review. its so fun. i love it. me and my sister cant stop playing it. the only problem i have is that sometimes the ball doesnt go the way i want it to. other than that its great.
B00932A4N4|5.0|A wonderful love story on many different levels. Just right amount of subtext and people. Believable and heart felt in a up dated plot.
B00881PTRC|5.0|love it. me and my sister play it all the time. very fun. just like actual hang man. i love the animation of the hung little dude
B0093Q9SCS|5.0|Enjoyed seeing my homeland, still living there and seeing this island in person is the best. I wished more of the back story  of their marriage and his illness would have been explored.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|very fun. addicting. i keep playing its so fun. great game for kids and adults. so worth getting get this
B002N2SYAG|4.0|I enjoy the program but missed most of  the  5th season. I like the fact I have the option to do so with my Kindle.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|this was an excellant story of how someone can stay alive using thier knowledge and skills in an very bad situation until mhelp arrives
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The author did a good job with the romance aspect and without the graphic sex it would have been even better. The only thing that saves the H from being a psycho loser is that the reader knows he's so vulnerable and really loves the h. In that respect it is like twilight. In real life no one would know that. Think how unappealing he'd be if he just dumped her and moved on to someone else.<br />I'm no fan of voyeuristic sex scenes. A good writer can convey intimate info without so much lurid detail. I skipped a lot of that cr4 p so I could follow the interesting progression of their attachment and how he was changing for the better.<br />I think modern authors cater too much to sex starved reader's who need to get a life. That said, it's an interesting story despite the ad nauseam sex.<br />One more complaint is that he keeps referring to her as \\"innocent\\",  uh. No. This h is inexperienced (at first) but innocence is a mental ,spiritual state, and this chick ain't even close.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|What's NOT to love about the Bronte sisters and their view of the family life!  It is a terrific read with just enough sparks to keep you interested.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This season moves into more detail of the relationships and we see a complex way of relating, ranging from passion to dealing with responsibility and wish fulfillment. I like the interaction and adult decisions made by the characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is the best horse game you can groom it treat it even do shows! And take photos of your horse or your horse and you! And feed it! Best game ever.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very intense, thought provoking movie!<br />My 11 year old son really liked it.<br />It touched upon many emotions.<br />May be disturbing for some children & young teens.
B006QPX7UI|3.0|A good movie. Good scenery. Good reenactments. Very long. Good performances. Sam Elliott is great. A good movie. Good scenery. Good reenactments. Very long. Good performances.

B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|It was very good. You dont get many stories like this and this is one of a kind that is thought prevoking.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My kid is addicted to these and he loves it.  Therefore, so do I.  I would recommend to any Doctor Who enthusiast, regardless of age.  All proper Doctors need a Sonic Screwdriver.  Let's face it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|After using the app on my iPhone for so long I never dreamed it would be this bad.<br /><br /> I can't &quot;like&quot; things. Oh it's there, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />No built in browser. This is my biggest pet peeve because if I do click on a link and use the kindle browser, when I come back to fb I have to start ALL OVER again in the news feed. Some days this isn't bad but on days that people are actively posting it's a huge pain. This has been a feature on the iPhone app for a long time! What gives?<br /><br />On a lot of pages and groups the feed isn't working correctly. After scrolling a bit the feed turns to a gray background. I can see the posts but cannot view them if they are long, can't see any photos that might be included, can't comment on them. In short they can't be interacted with in ANY way.<br /><br />It's like the developers don't even use their own product on a regular basis to see its shortcomings.
B008D28HYS|4.0|It is fun to have images with multiple colors. If ypu are familiar with this type of puzzle, there isn't anything surprising or super different about this particular version - other than the help that the colors give you in deciphering the image. Nice relaxing way to keep the mind occupied.
B0095P29EG|4.0|The story was okay and Chris Hemsworth is very attractive, but I could not get past a Norse God with an Australian accent.  However, Tom Hiddleston made Loki a fascinating, complex villain.  I felt so bad for him all through the movie.  I think the best thing Kenneth Brannagh does is make every character fascinating.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Rene Russo as his wife, were excellent.<br /><br />And Stellan Skarsgard steals every scene he is in unless Kat Dennings is in it.  Those two were a hoot.  The sets were gorgeous and most of the acting was very good.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I bought this book on a whim and was immediately drawn into the storyline. Read it in one sitting. I love books and this is a book that is about books, mystery and the human spirit. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes such topics. Engaging and charming. Very happy I checked this one out.

B005K17RU0|1.0|This app is constantly loading the ad banners that appear at the bottom of the page.  This locks up the app to the point that I couldn't even try to change the settings or the view of the data.  After 10 minutes of frustration, I uninstalled it and downloaded Weatherbug.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is very useful for all types of things(reading; looking for things in the dark;etc.) It is very light on the highest setting and u can even lower the lighting. You can even change the COLOR!!! It is awesome.

I have read it 8 times and make it a habit to reread it each year as a \\"tune-up\\".

B0084IG8TM|5.0|Wonderful movie... not everything is how the book goes, but what movie does. It is a wonderful movie and we watch it often. We do recommend reading the book series, as they are wonderful as well and will help fill in the gaps and answer questions one might have.
B0091REZMW|3.0|still fun too fun early fun to fun give fun a fun real fun rating fun.  did fun I fun mention fun the game fun is fun fun
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier by Ishmael Beah is both heartfelt and heartbreaking at the same time - if that even makes sense (or if it's even possible). It's sort of difficult to express how I feel about this novel because it provokes so many emotions from me.  At times, I'm happy for Beah and his adventures with his friend as they express their excitement, happiness, and growing interest in American culture such as our hip hop, rap music and dance.<br /><br />These stories that he tells of his past is almost as if we are invading in on his deepest, most powerful thoughts that are meant to be private, but here we are - reading them as if it was a journal that was open for everyone to read and acknowledge. He talks about his relationship with his family, particularly with his mother and father and how it is a constant struggle of going back and forth between the two of them and how he personally feels about one or the other and it literally breaks my heart how his father holds back when expressing his true thoughts and emotions about him as a son.<br /><br />Aside from all of the descriptive and detailed acts of violence as mentioned by Beah in the memoir, there is this sort of rush of innocence being captured or taken away from these young boys as they are thrown into this war without their consent or knowledge of what is actually going on.  Regardless of this memoir informing those of the actual events that occurred all throughout Sierra Leone, but it also gives us this insight and interpersonal perspective of the severity of the actual war and so on.<br /><br />Ideally, the talk of feminism throughout this course with discussion boards and lecture modules, I feel as if this memoir took the whole perspective of how women are treated in these type of predicaments and almost showcased that it's not only an issue that women have to deal with - but also young men and so on.  Just from reading all of the detailed events that occurred during this time is captivating and really opens our eyes and minds about the treatment of not only women, but of people in general regardless of race, social/economical status, and gender.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|The person that I gave the dvd to is a big fan of BatMan and thought the dvd was really good
B00AGKH7K0|3.0|When I ordered this CD I really wanted to like it, but after it arrived and I had some quality listening time, I thought about all those great athletes who played past their prime, thinking this CD was an example of a great musician who created this CD when he was past his prime.  Eric Clapton released his latest CD about the same time and though he's probably about the same age, that music had much better quality to it than Eric's.
B007JMW46U|5.0|The book was exactly as it was described on the site. I would recommend it to anyone that likes sherlock holmes.
B005MLP71Y|3.0|Its not a great animated film and Jerry Seinfeld's voice is so noticeable it kind of ruins the experience. The movie feels much older than it is as well. All in all its an OK movie with some funny stuff scattered throughout but very forgettable.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I know it's well written, wel composed. I tried to read it twice now, and tried to watch the HBO series. But I just don't like it. It's one of the few novels I gave up before finishing it.  It's too cruel, not enough humor, maybe. Too terrible. Let another man enjoy this; not me.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Excellent.  The first half is captivating, then at midway it gets even better.  Loved the examples that illustrated the formula of the book.  Would recommend to anyone (and I do, often).
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|He like the idea of controling his own island. He loves doing the challanges. It can sometimes take a while to upgrade levels.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This was a book club read for me. I'm not sure I would of completed it otherwise. It left me with more questions than answers. Too much medical jargon that could have been reduced & condensed for the lay person. The imagery was confusing. If you enjoy near death experiences than this is a book for you Debi Watson
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was awesome! it was totally worth the $5. was long but kept me interested. I even got lost in the game a few times.
B000N6U0DS|4.0|Will Smith does a great job.  This movie is family friendly.  I used it for an economics lesson; cost benefit analysis. Should he have taken a no pay internship in exchange for a chance of a job?  The students loved it.
B000P0J09C|4.0|I've always liked the movie and I loved the price and lately, the quality of the movies being sent are improving since my last review(s)...
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app in question does not work at all on the original Kindle Fire.  It does not work terribly well on anything else.
B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|I cannot stand Woody Allen. However, he had me in stitches in this one. 5 Stars at the minimum. I'm really glad it popped up as a movie I may like. I remember this movie went for over $40.00 on Amazon for a used one about 2 years ago. I'm glad the price came down below what i would have paid for...
B002VRZEYM|4.0|It was very informative and it was very descriptive. it was a great eye opener to where our food really comes from.
B0009HAHD4|5.0|Yep, genuine Nikon. Comfortable, portable. You've tried the rest, now buy the best. If you didn't think you can afford a real Nikon rubber eyecup, think again. You can always do lease with an option to buy, like I did.<br />Peace out.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This horribly disturbing tale has no storyline therefore I cannot and shall not read it once more. Good day sir.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|nice stress reliever - fun game for me.  wheter i am in the car, at a conference or at home - good brain teaser.
B005HSL626|3.0|I used to love this app , it is an okay-app but I got bored after a while of playing it, now I never play it! It just isn't my kind of app!:/ all you do is slice fruit...yuuup:p
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|my boyfriend usually takes my kindle to play this game for hours.  i may need to get him a kindle with this game...
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a very special app! It is easy, and very high-tech In my opinion!:) you can read,watch,listen too, everything!:p and it is the bible, so to me it honestly makes it a lot more fun to read the bible! I really like this app ,I think you will too!:)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Admission- I read this based on loving the movie. How delightful it was to enjoy the  book so thoroughly and on different levels! If you saw the movie, the book has significantly different plot development. I love the fresh depiction of mental illness and the ways people cope. Refreshing and honest.
B008M721MS|3.0|I absulutely loved this app when my dad was deployed in Iraq! It was very convenient! I could keep in touch with him a lot more easy and see him!:) but now I use it to talk to my friend! You can Skype anyone, even if they live close to you! It is fun!:) my only negative, is now that I use it, it is constantly freezing up! And sometimes the voice is fuzzy.... but usually it is a trust-worthy app!:)
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I listened the audiobook of Bossypants a few years ago and picked up the kindle edition on sale. What a delight all over again. Hearing her read initially via audiobook was awesome, as she is able to give her inflections and asides, but the great part is that she is able to convey that through text as well. If you love her TV/movie writing, you'll love this book as well.
B008IEWBJ8|5.0|An amazing piece! Imagine taking a classic ... distilling the best parts and re-presenting the results. The whole exercise could have gone wrong in so many ways but the fact that it doesn't is a real testimony to Richter's talent ... Highly recommended!
B005DOKL3E|4.0|I like the case and it works perfect for traveling, fits in almost any case, and it's easy to find.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|Over the top, silly-sick humor. I love it. This movie is too funny and I will enjoy watching it again and again.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I was starting to feel like I was the only person on the planet not tweeting.  Time to tweet away!
B0050PYNO4|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It makes fun of everything and I enjoy every minute of it. &#34;There are wasps in my brain.&#34; LOL
B009NX2XA0|5.0|It's the same story as Rio Bravo but the cast in this one is FAR better. Watching Ed Asner get shot ALWAYS makes me happy. Mitchum, The Duke, and Jimmy Caan have far better chemistry than did Duke and Dean Martin.
B007WULJ5G|4.0|This movie was shocking, gory, gut-wrenching and in my opinion quite possible. There are people in this world who would pay to see something like this, even if it I prefer to believe it is beyond belief.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|This isn't a review of the movie just its contents. this bluray dvd combo has an ultra violet copy for those who like to use flixster for viewing on the go. i actually like ultra violet, being able to use flixster as a medium to view your movies on the go, as well as being able to download said movie for offline viewing on up to 5 different devices is ingenious.<br />the movie comes in both french and spanish audio options as well as subtitles. now if your wondering about extras, your in luck. theres everything from talks with Steven speilburg to behind the scenes features about using live actors for the motion capture software, to how they built a set to house all the action for the entire movie. hint, its only the size of a basketball court. there are i believe around 9 or so featurettes on this bluray which i love. always love seeing the behind the scenes things on what makes a movie like this come to life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0034G4P4Y The Adventures of Tintin (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]]
B003XU3MWM|5.0|Centurion doesn't reach very high, but the modesty of its goals work in its favor - it delivers the simple adventure story it promises.
B0095R64AO|1.0|This made my eyes and my ears bleed.  Just painful to watch. Felt the story was just all over the place.  Bored.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Really fun movie. Goofy and quirky enough for kids, and still smart enough for adults. Burton scored with this one.
B00A83075M|5.0|Loved it and so did my children..  Fun for whole family!  Very good movie. Worth buying even if not on sale.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|While the main characters are a little dysfunctional and qwerky like most people, and their relationship has some problems, the series repeatedly stresses the importance of communication and trust in a healthy relationship - even if the characters fail to follow the advice. (jealousy is not trust)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Started watching the series when a friend loaned me their season 1 on blu-ray. As usual the books contain so much more detail. There is a lot of background given on each of the characters that they just couldn't fit into the HBO shows.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Actually not all that smutty, despite the S&M. NPR talked about &#34;Whip Smart&#34; by Melissa Febos and Belle de Jour's &#34;Diary of an Unlikely Call Girl&#34; a few years ago and those books were probably more graphic as they are first-hand accounts of the truth. I was surprised and delighted by Fifty Shades - James through in some high-stakes adventure, crime-mystery, relationships, and careers in with the sexy escapades.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Love the zip case. It fits the Kindle perfectly, and helps protect it when I carry it in my briefcase, or just out socially. It even seems to be splash proof as I have had it in the rain and the kindle is fine. Highly recommend.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|spoliler!  I thought it was going to be more action on the &#34;flight&#34; but turns out it was more of drama about drugs and alcohol...Denzel is fantastic and this is a very good drama...
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|Used after reading book. Spell binding. Gave students a feel of what it was like then. Amazing how fast they arrived to class and didn't want to leave when the bell rang.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I hope they bring him back for more!  the opening is intense and I love the villian in this fast paced spy thriller!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have been doing this DVD for almost a month now. I think it is a good work out and all of the levels offer distinct moves that progressively make the workouts harder. It can be a little hard on the knees with all of the jumping jacks and squats, but as long as you use good form it is doable. I definitely have not lost up to 20 pounds, but I have lost at least 5 and that is without following her diet. I do not follow the diet, because it is only free for a little while and then you have to pay. All in all I am enjoying this DVD and seeing results. I think it offers a solid, quick workout that I will and have been recommending to other people.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is a great flick!  great acting, action, excitement from start to end!  definitely best picture!  Ben Affleck made a great return to the big screen.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Loved it! I love western movies and I love quintino! So goooooooood and modern but still kinda true to era
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|if you are a history buff I'm sure you will love it...as a fan of movies, it starts very slow, but does pick up...good acting, and pretty realistic portrayal of life in the late 1800's...its dark, everyone is wearing blankets and jackets in the house...Daniel Day Lewis was quite amazing...
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This Intel i5-3570 3.4Ghz. processor is the BOMB!!! It can handle anything you throw at it. You can multitask all daylong and it just keeps putting out. This thing is wild. For the gamers it is a must have if you can't afford the Intel i7. This is a very reliable processor.<br />Also people that do a great deal of film editing etc.you have to get one. if you ever experience the power of this processor you'll never go back to what you had before especially if you haven't updated in quite a while.
B00364K6YW|5.0|The miniseries itself is by far the best version of this novel that I have seen, and is absolutely terrific.<br /><br />This DVD was high quality with regard to both video and sound.
1936608898|4.0|I look forward to my Whole30! This was a great recommendation from a friend who has completed the Whole30. It changed her life and I hope it will be the first step to changing mine.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched the entire series on Amazon streaming over 2 days of being ill.  The show itself is engaging, in a soap-opera way but with the delight of a period drama.  The streaming version worked well, with a couple hiccups.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Great kid and adult movie.  We loved that you were creatively used the Arcade and the first video game styles ever made
B0019IB0II|5.0|This short fascinating book is interesting on three levels: first, as a example of what an unusual stroke event can tell us about the human brain and humanity itself; second, as a personal memoir of what experiencing a stroke is like; and third, as a insight into a new way of being in the world.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to almost anyone.
B0057UA486|5.0|I never saw this Kubrick film.  I'm glad I waited to see it in the Blu Ray format in HI- Def. Picture and sound quality are awesome, especially the outdoor scenes. Highly recommend this.

B000NQRE1E|5.0|Love the movie! Watching it on Blu-ray was amazing! It was better than ever before! I recommend buying this and giving the movie a chance to re-amaze you!

B008MEM24S|1.0|This game is much too confusing for young children. Needs some instructions or hints or some sort of guidance. Very disappointed.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked the book, it was well written, I like the way he used first person etc in telling the story.  It was a sad story but good and well written
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am so in love with this story!  Eben Alexander's life and experience is truly unique and one-of-a-kind; perhaps a story that may never happen to another human in our lifetime - it is so amazing.  I was totally transformed by his description of his near death experience.  He captures and describes the indescribable absolutely gorgeously; and though he says he will never truly begin to put accurate words to his experience, he did a phenomenal job!  I was so transformed and touched deeply by his experience that I continue to re-read his book.  The dual worlds of neuroscientist/MD colliding with such a profound near death experience is a combination that is truly miraculous; as was his recovery.  It is a rare opportunity for us to hear of such a transcendental experience from a highly educated and highly scrupulous mind of a neurosurgeon.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was hooked from the first page.  This is a great book with excellent character development.  I laughed and cried throughout the book.  I couldn't put it down and read it in 2 days.  I can't wait to read the other books by Garth Stein.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I thought the near death experience she described would blow my socks off, but what actually make a huge impact on me was this woman's perspective after the experience.  This story is nearly unbelievable, although I totally believe it.  However, her transformation honestly is the best testimony to her experience as she speaks from a Sage's Wisdom - and yet unlike I have ever heard because she came from such honest, normal upbringing - like many of us, not able to find acceptance within ourselves.  This book melted into my very cells and transformed me!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|My wife and I compete regularly to see who can get the highest scores.  Our kids have even gotten in on the action.  Lots of fun!
B005LAIIFS|5.0|My nephews love this movie! It was a great buy. The eggs were great for Easter! We loved both parts!
B008DW6VOQ|3.0|I certainly don't dislike this app, but I rarely use it because it seems that there are other products that do the same thing in a better fashion.  Or it could just be that I'm used to seeing the information presented in a certain way.  Regardless, it gives you market info, but it wouldn't be my #1 selection in this category.
0385523912|3.0|I got this book from the library based on reviews I read (it has 358 5-star reviews on Amazon), but I wasn't that impressed with it. This book was a good look at North Korean lives and cultures through the lens of six citizens over 15 years, through the rough period surrounding Kim Il-sung's death, and the famine of the mid-90s. Demick mixes stories from the small villages with that of life in the capitol city of Pyongyang, providing a thorough over view of how life was different depending on your political and social standing.<br /><br />I was surprised how many historical events I didn't really know, and this book was good with facts. I have read other books about North Korea in which I've felt connected with the people and more concerned with their welfare. Where I think it hit some bumps, was the quantities of lives it was following. Some of this may have been due to listening to it, since I don't think I can follow a book as well on tape as I can on paper. And though it says a person read it, at times it sounded like a computer reading the book. The one benefit of the audiobook, I know how to pronounce all the names of people and places.<br /><br />For me this was a good addition to the other books I have read on this topic, but not that great as a stand alone.<br /><br />original review: [...]
B000FA5STS|5.0|Full of twists and turns and surprises, this novel of intrigue is unique and an exciting read. If you haven't read Baldacci before, I think you will be hooked after this book.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Kind of gritty. Found myself very involved with the characters and sometimes cheering for the bad guys. I was very disappointed when it ended. Would have liked to watch years more.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Didn't guess the ending ahead of time at all.  I've read 3 of Kate Morton's books now and loved them all.  Great writer!
B004SRNH10|4.0|It funny how much money to buy the first planet just games for just hello but it was not the world
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Pay attention to the reviews---this is truly a 5-star game.  Beautiful to look at and interesting and fun to play.  Worth every penny(and it was a fair price too!).  The quality and play-ability of \\"The Room\\" should be every game-makers' goal.  I really loved it and look forward to more from this developer!
B0058YPILY|5.0|This review is about the discs because the show is great or I would not be ordering yet another season. Came in quickly in perfect condition and plays well.
B00004D301|5.0|I Found this movie very informative as it was researched to be that way and very intertaining.  Even being an older movie the story line holds ones attention and delivers on excitement.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|This case does everything they claimed it would do and that is what I needed.<br />I would recommend this to others.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|The movie was unable to stream correctly. It would start and stop within the first twenty minutes of the movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is pretty fun..something I can quickly play on breaks and naps...I recommend playing this game. easy to navigate.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book was engaging from the moment I picked it up. It was easy read. The story is pretty much Macgyver meets Mars. I recommend it as a weekend escape vehicle. The multiple story lines kept it moving along.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I got this for my teenager and the whole family has enjoyed playing it!  We still have yet to solve it.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|This is great.  Period.  A wonderful product with an almost endless list of super great songs from over the years.  I was shocked when I read some of the reviews bashing this album and saying it was disappointing.  I guess that's just like........their opinion, man.  Whatever, I think this is awesome and if you love stills and his works from over the years, I highly recommend this album.  It's great.
B000O3GCYQ|2.0|The order arrived promptly, but the set of 6 novels was not a set.  5 were matching, the 6th was added to fill in the missing book.  I wrote to the sender, she asked for photos to remind herself.  I sent the photos, and she replied she was out of town and would get back to me.  That was over 2 weeks ago, and I haven't heard.  And, the email address doesn't work anymore.  I feel I was mislead by false advertising, and paid a large price for a matched set.  I would like to have this resolved.  I paid a handsome price, and would like to get my money back.
B00A8LYYI0|4.0|It was a little strange! but I was captured with the 3d effects<br />Maybe if I had been into the video game, it would have made<br />more of a connection with me. But still it was a pretty good stand alone<br />horror flick  But for me content doesn't matter just love lots of 3d
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Didn't understand the hype over the movies until I read these books. That are all exceptional! Recommend to any who like supernatural.
0525425764|5.0|These may be listed as a kids' series but my husband & I both enjoyed all 3 books in this series, & we are well past 'kid' age! Book arrived new in days after I placed the order.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Really good book I'm off to see the wizard now. Read the whole collection it's so AWESOMELY Wonderful !!!! :)
0525425578|5.0|This series may be listed as a kids' series but both my husband & I loved all 3 books in this series & we are well beyond kids! Love John Grisham books. This arrived promptly & in perfect condition.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I have read other books by Rick Riordan and found them great. This book is hard to put down you want to see what is going to happen next. I would recommend this book to all readers of all ages. It's not just for kids.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I still remember the surprise when the critter burst out of John Hurt's chest in Alien, and the many shocks since then.  This is a great set of films, and in particular since they are in Blu-Ray.  I also just saw Prometheus and was more than a little surprised to find it to be the prequel.  Much better than AVP.  This was one of my better picks since I'm not really into horror.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I came across this book more than 25 years ago and every time I read it there is something new to contemplate and learn.
B000U1ZV8K|4.0|Every time I think I have this &#34;formula&#34; down, the directors throw me a curve.  Clearly, these movies are all about action, but the first and second were excellent stories as well.  Numbers three and four seemed more comedies with a lot of action, and all were fun to watch.
B002CPMB9O|5.0|This has got to be one of the best modern true life/crime dramas. Based on the life of one of Harlem's most successful criminals. Crowe is superb as the investigating cop turned defense attorney. A must see.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I was awed when I saw Jurassic Park in the theater the first time, then equally awed with The Lost World.  III was good, too, but I was spoiled by then.  I'm glad I bought these in Blu-Ray and recommend the series highly.
B00000K3UU|5.0|Still one of the greatest movies by Adam Sandler! Enjoyed the movie again. Couldn't find it in stores so had to buy it here online. It was a great deal!
B00006D295|4.0|I almost (repeat almost) miss the insanity of the theater production of this film.  It was always fun watching how silly everyone was when acting out the movie during the movie.  As a musical and as entertainment, this is a great film, but clearly not for everyone.  I think it almost stereo-typed Tim Curry, though.  Great film.
0425252868|5.0|This was a very enjoyable read.  I am a WW11 buff, and this book brings out the point that a man can do his duty abo.ve and beyond, and still show humanity even in war.  Above all; Christianity prevailed.
B0000DIXDR|4.0|When I first saw this movie, I was teaching ballet (a great place to meet women), and I really enjoyed how well Patrick Swayze's character presented a positive view of a dance teacher.  Jennifer Grey was very good as Baby, although I'll always remember her from Red Dawn.  This was an excellent feel-good movie.
B002KV4NTQ|5.0|I have this on LP and really crave it on my iPod, so I pulled the trigger and haven't stopped spinning it since. Classic!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great storyline, good character development, good pace to the book. I have read a number of Balducci's books and this is one of his best.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|At first my son and I really loved this game! After playing a few weeks we had issues receiving peanuts after completing a survey. Then the game froze and when it finally started back up, my son lost everything...he had no animals or anything! He was on level 20 and had to start all over! He is only 4 years old but he was pretty upset. It's a fun game but don't get too attached as it seems to have lots of kinks to work out still.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Like the Headset I did not buy this product for me I purchased the product for employees in our Kansas City office.  The employees in the office love this product just as much as they love the headset.  Thanks Amazon.
1401323820|2.0|I watch the TV show Castle and hoped reading this would be as fun and clever as an episode of the show. The book was not very well written and I gave up on it about 35 pages in.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Outstanding movie.  The photography and the story line are wonderful. We've watched it numerous times since we received it and will watch it again and again.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing. You will not regret seeing this. Keep the tissue box close though. This one hits you in the heart.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Very good acting, the story was interesting, and I enjoyed the music/soundtrack.  Sometimes the storms lasted a long time, but there were many lovely, magical moments that balanced things out.
B009R659L8|5.0|Definitely, Mary Higgins Clark is the queen of suspense! Great twists and turns. I could not put it down. I had to know who, what, where & when. I recommend all of her books. And, I wait impatiently for the next book.
B00B7VZN76|1.0|Before anything, I need to acknowledge that I do not own, nor have I viewed, this product, nor any other TNG season on DVD or Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I am writing this review as somebody that recently watched this show from beginning to end on Netflix, where the entire series is available for streaming for any and all Netflix subscribers, I find it jaw-droppingly insane that each season of this show has a retail price of $130.  Currently, this season is on sale, at 70% off, to bring the price down to $60.  That is STILL insane.<br /><br />The pricing for this product is absurd, toxic, and unnecessary.  If one were to buy the entire series at this 70% off sale price, it would be $360, though that is impossible; as of about halfway through 2013, this show is less than less than halfway available on disc.  At retail, purchasing the series on Blu-Ray would cost $910 plus tax.  That is MADNESS when ANYBODY with an internet connection could watch the -entire- show for a subscription costing about $8 a month.<br /><br />I love this show completely and utterly.  It's an amazing monument to human imagination.  But anybody that purchases any season of this show at this price point, no offense, should seriously look into several bridges that I'm selling.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|Bought specifically for and used it on vacation because I knew I wouldn't be in my car and able to charge it constantly.  So, I just stuck my phone and the charged in my backpack and I always had a full charge. I used it on the beach so I was able to surf the web and listen to music all day without having to worry about my battery.  I also liked this one because it was smaller than the other.  It's still new, so I can comment on it's durability or long term usefulness, but so far so good.
B00C0YQLDE|5.0|Usually I am not one to leave a review but for this album I must.  I own all of Bonobo's albums and due to my lack of intelligent literary techniques I am going to say that this album is SO great......  It's DELICIOUS!!
B00A812HOS|5.0|These guys are truly original.  The music is psychedelic, for sure - at times wavy, at times driving, sometimes goofy.  And there is an awesome call to mozart era harpsichord in the guitarist's playing.  The drummer and bassist are tight as hell.  This is all not to mention the sometimes strange, sometimes dreamy, always catchy vocals in their throaty, choir-like style.  I love these guys.  Buy their first album too.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Loving Season 3, much more intense than Season 2. It is great to find a show that we can watch together!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I love anything NCIS and missed the first show of the season. I did not mind purchasing the view to I could keep up!
B00004YRQA|5.0|This memory card works perfectly. I haven't had any problems with it not saving. Overall I am pleased with it.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it was real heartwarming to see the effort and cooperation of all concerned to save some of Gods wonderful creation. Showing that wonderful things can be done when we set aside petty differences and band together to accomplish wonderful things.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Yes, the perfect movie for 3D.  What Spielberg did was take a bunch of second rate actors (except Richard Attenborough), so the real stars are the Dinosaurs.  Really action packed like Jaws, heart pounding, scary, with a touch of dark humor (Man eaten on toilet).  Perfect blend of all emotions.  Not for small children, as it could be very nightmarish. As said this is the perfect vehicle for 3D and it is used and done in an excellent manner.  I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.  This movie has not aged, after all it is about Dinosaurs.  It is Fresh and Scary, as it was in 1993.
B003UESJ9M|3.0|Not my favorite movie but it does show the ups and downs of being famous when indulging in everything they want for some stars.
0061353248|5.0|Predictably Irrational is a fascinating journey through human behavior. I thoroughly enjoyed each chapter and thought that the experiments described that were created by the author and his colleagues were creative and enlightening.  Highly recommended!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This entire album is just incredible! The talent of these two men is amazing and is a joy to listen to! So glad I came across them on YouTube... Will def. be buying their CDs for years to come!
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Warning-contains spoiler! Being a mathematician and computer programmer myself, I take great offense that the cinema usually depicts all of us geeks as obsessive-compulsive, sickly, and bordering on insanity. The cinematography was horrible. The constant irritating noises in the film, like the incessant phone ringing, was almost more than I could bear. The film was almost devoid of a plot. When the Orthodox Jewish numerologist kidnapped the star and had his cohort beat him up, I had had enough and turned it off. I've only stopped or walked out on 3 or 4 movies in my life. My 10-year-old could have created a better film. Do yourself a favor and pass on watching this movie; I wish I had.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Wow, so glad Tootle is ditching Google Reader because it got me to try Freely! Though I used to use FeedDemon, it's now losing support when GReader goes away. Freely says they'll have a substitute feed system live before GReader goes away. Hope they follow through with it.
B002YCVWXQ|2.0|Ridiculous plot, poor acting (especially Brad Pitt), unnecessary use of the&#34;F&#34; word. Characters are stereotyped (e.g. all Germans are bad). I wouldn't recommend it to anyone&#62;
B0060MYKTY|5.0|If you think the Catholic Church has problems now, it is nothing compared to the Borgias actions of their time.
0786838655|3.0|Several reviewers pointed out that it's VERY similar to Harry Potter - and it is - wow. I think that JK Rowling might even be able to sue for copyright infringement.<br /><br />But it was a fun read and My 10-year-old liked it, so I guess I will forgive the author - if I were JK I wouldn't.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|IT REMINDS ME MY CHILDHOOD. I was a huge fan of Mario back then . The main character is different but the concept is the same. Thank you :-)
B004NELBPC|1.0|The new format is not User friendly and the print is too small to read.Please! Please return the original format.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'd been looking for a cool puzzle game and this one is it! Really needed to think about how to get different things open. Half way through. Used help a couple times but hope to avoid it the rest of the game now that I'm in the groove of the game. I hope that there are more games like this.
0670020745|5.0|This book describes a woman's courage and remarkable understanding of her neurological and emotional makeup. Also, very helpful are recommendations for the relatives and friends of stroke victims. She describes how these people can help the stroke victims in their recoveries. To me, the book also gives an explanation for the reasons behind near death experiences, explaining them in a psychological and physical framework, not a mystical one.
0374533652|5.0|Most reviewers seem to have had a positive impression of Michael Sandel's book on the moral limits of markets.  The paperback edition is just out, and so I'll register my positive impression too.  First, though, it seems important to indicate some of the limits of Sandel's enterprise.  This is not an academic treatise -- it's for a general readership with the time, leisure, and inclination to think about certain questions, but it doesn't assume a high degree of philosophical or economic expertise.  So  I think Herbert Gintis, in his critical and thoughtful review, misses the point a bit when he complains that \\"Sandel does not try to formulate a comprehensive moral structure that tells us when to use markets and when not. I think he should have tried.\\"  Dr Gintis is right about what Sandel doesn't do, but I think Sandel's aim is less lofty: it's just to get us to think about values in certain cases where economic values are part of the picture.  If this were an academic treatise, Dr Gintis's point would be very damaging.  Given what kind of book this is, however, his point matters a lot less.  Other critical reviewers, less thoughtful than Dr Gintis, see Sandel as smearing economics and economists.  I don't see that at all.  Nowhere does Sandel indicate that the attitudes he's questioning are uncritically or widely held by serious economists.  \\"Market fundamentalism\\" is what I think he's criticizing, and that is the realm of politicians and self-appointed pundits, not economists.  Also, I notice that some critics accuse Sandel of not saying anything very new.  That's not really a criticism -- Sandel lays no claim to originality.  He just wants to keep certain questions alive.<br /><br />The questions he wants to keep alive are questions about fairness and what he calls \\"corruption,\\" and the chapter in which he is most explicitly focused on these questions is the third: \\"How Markets Crowd Out Morals\\" -- but the questions are ones that occur throughout.  The fairness question has to do with the degree of freedom in economic transactions. In a market for organs, for example, to what extent might a person who is experiencing serious economic difficulties feel compelled by these circumstances to sell, say, a kidney?  or blood?  Sandel's point is that we ought to think long and hard about what he calls \\"inequalities in the background conditions of society\\" before judging such a sale genuinely \\"free.\\"  It's clear to me that he has a point, and it should be noted that he isn't being prescriptive here.  He's just asking us to think.<br /><br />The\\"corruption\\" issue raises this question: \\"If a 'good' (say, blood, or education) is made part of a market transaction, is the good changed?\\"  Again, he has no one-size-fits-all answer, but if, for example, one of the \\"goods\\" in blood donation is in the altruistic gift of the donation, does the fact that many people sell their blood change the nature of the gift?  Sandel says that in this case, the altruistic person might do better to donate money to the blood bank so that it can help a poor person get the money for his or blood -- thus helping not just the eventual receiver of the blood but the poor person who needs the money.  That's not exactly an answer -- but he does note that since the buying and selling of blood has increased, donation has gone down, and he clearly considers that a loss, because in his mind sacrifice for a civic good is itself a good.  He pokes fun at some theorists who argue that we ought to monetize as many transactions as possible, to avoid \\"using up\\"our altruistic resources (I think he quotes Larry Summers as having made that argument).  Readers can probably figure out why he thinks that's a silly thing to say.  In a similar vein, on a less fraught topic, he addresses the issue of giving loved ones money instead of material gifts.<br /><br />Much of the pleasure lies in seeing him working through, and inviting us to work through, a number of situations that raise questions about market limits, from skyboxes in baseball stadiums to the complicated market in life insurance.  Did you know that your employer might have taken out a policy on your life, with himself as beneficiary? Is that OK?  Is it OK if he tells you?  Does it require your consent?  Why should or shouldn't it?  And is it OK for him to sell that policy to a financial firm to bundle and re-sell?  Fascinating stuff!  You'll learn about a lot of things you didn't know -- and you'll have to ponder the two big questions.  Recommended.tions about market limits, from skyboxes in baseball stadiums to the complicated market in life insurance.

B009NPA3MS|5.0|Love this CD as well as earlier one.  PP has been a favorite since his time on American Idol.  Love his folksy style.
0062238868|5.0|good book,stories are good well written.chris was a true warrior who believed in helping out and living by the golden rule...if more people were like him the world would be better...
0679809015|3.0|This book is really adorable but it is so small. It does make a good book for the car seat or stroller, though. If it comes in full size (which I'm unsure if it does) I'd give it 5 stars. The size brings it own.
0061992860|3.0|Book was purchase on my account, for a friend, as gift for another friend.  Hope other reviewers are able to give better feedback.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Hole is an interesting character. The story is very well written (although the names took a while to get used to with regards to character placement), and well researched. Definitely want to read the next instalment.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Book Four continues with many of the characters that we have grown to love or hate.  The author has no compunction about preserving their lives, so we never know who is going to be killed, maimed or elevated in the next chapter.  At the end, the author points to Book Five for what happens to other characters whose exploits were not covered in Book Four.  Long as these books are, the anticipation built up at the end of each chapter builds the need to read more about that character.  I've read about three chapters of Book Five, and I have spoken with others who share my avid interest in it.  One said he has even written to George R. R. Martin to get busy with Book Six.  I definitely concur.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was great and I always wanted to read more! This book was so unpredictable as well. You should definitely read it!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I liked this when I heard it years ago, finally realized this should be in my collection. The melodies are haunting, the lyrics impassioned, and there is a universal appeal in the style of the tunes that makes this really timeless.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved it. The Last Olympian is a hit. It was absolutely amazing it was so full of adventure<br />Great book
B0019LZV4E|3.0|Honestly don't remember buying this - perhaps it was ordered from my account by a friend for a friend.  Not sure....
B0042U94UQ|4.0|Not sure of the age group rating but it's funny enough for Adults. Was bought for kids and their parents.
B007ZSBQYE|3.0|Note: I'm not going to explain here how it is possible to use an external controller on Android, but it is pretty easy to do if you simply do a little bit of homework and research. there are applications that will also help you use external controllers on Android. And then configure them as well. That being said, this game is pretty much unplayable using the on screen controls. That is why I removed two stars it is because the author obviously intends it to be played with on screen controls and it is nearly impossible to play it that way. However, when you add a real game controller then the game is great. If the author decides to support external controllers natively I will then change my rating to 5 stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved everything! The storyline was great and i felt like i was actually there!<br /><br />Great and really well written too!
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|I had read a few books about the subject and this one is the one I like the most. What else can i say.  I am using it!
B009VB97EY|3.0|Was very disappointed in this movie.  I read the other reviews (several of them) before purchasing....many indicated the dancing made up for the poor plot lines and acting.  Not!  Channing Tatum is a great dancer, and I have a feeling the material was more the culprit than his acting, but geez.  Having read the other reviews, my expectations were low when I watched it, but I still ended up thinking it was a waste of money and time.
0345472322|5.0|Great information, in a terrific format.  Still reading the book, and have found it most helpful.  A must read for parents - too bad you don't get a copy in the hospital when you are headed home with your new bundle of joy!
B00005JSGK|5.0|As usual, a good movie for both adults and early age children.  No gratuitous sex and entertaining plot with a little bit of drama.
034580404X|5.0|I enjoyed reading the series.  I definately liked the ending of the 3rd book. It was nice to get the other sides point of view from what started it all.  Almost wished it continued on some more that way.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This version of spider is very good,so addictive. It's responsive. The only thing I would change is it needs more choices as far as background and card backs.
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|While the author dragged out the main character's misery  in painstaking detail, his  moments of  joy, or triumph, were relayed with the speed of a bandaid being ripped off!
B004T4KQJS|3.0|Very tantalizing theories, but the frequent diversions to demean Theists were annoying and detracted from the ethos of the arguments. If you have the high ground in an argument you should stay there. A summary of the latest theories in cosmology can be done without one being a jerk about it.
B009AMANBA|3.0|This wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be from all the reviews.  That could be because of the narrow time period covered in the movie.  On the positive, the acting was excellent.  Daniel Day-Lewis certainly deserved his Oscar.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Reading Luttrell's account of the SEAL Team's mission into the foreign, dangerous world of the Taliban in the mountains of Afghanistan does not only give the reader a much better understanding of what the men of the SEALS are made of and what it<br />takes to become one; it draws the reader directly into the action. One becomes the fifth member of the team, so to speak, is able to share the responsibilities, the duties, the fears, the agony, the pain due to the loss of team members and friends. Ultimately, one is left to celebrate Luttrell's victory over the evil forces, rejoices over his rescue, and is conscious of the strong bond of brotherhood<br />that prevailed, which at the end culminates in a deep and lasting love that Luttrell now has for his fallen friends.
B003F29D44|4.0|Had to see for a class I'm taking about stock exchange. Very good movie, excellent pace, and a hard story, easy to follow from beginning to end. A real classic.

B009B4ZEKM|2.0|Would someone tell me, how in God's good name can this be anything but a desperate bid to get radio airplay, or reach the target audience for this type of music: Aguilera super-fanatics, fans of The Voice/American Idol type singers, and teenage chicks. Check out how many producers had their hands in this:Producer Alex da Kid, Chris Braide, Busbee, Mike Del Rio, Jayson DeZuzio, Dem Jointz, Jason Gilbert, Jamie Hartman, Aeon \\"Step\\" Manahan, Max Martin, Steve Robson, Lucas Secon, Shellback, Supa Dups, Tracklacers. P-L-EEASE! how can somebody produce a timeless classic (ie Beach Boys Pet Sounds, Pink Floyd Darkside of The Moon)wit so many cooks in da kitchen! This is another ploy to make money and sell songs on itunes for a buck twenty nine each! I am giving it two stars because, although it's overproduced as most major label artist do to get played on the radio, at least Christina has a great singing voice and foxy as hell! (unlike Britney Spears, JLo or some of the other music business hacks out there, who not only rely on seven or eight producers, but also need their producers to mask their lack of singing talent)
B00ATP24SW|5.0|Stratovarius knocked it out of the park with this release.  It is absolutely awesome. Timo still has that amazing voice I've loved for years. :)  The band has evolved, and is still most excellent. If you enjoyed the &#34;old&#34; line-up you won't be disappointed; the musicianship and variety is great.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|way better than regular version. has mine carts, better graphics, ext. really good app. thanks imangi studios. get this app.
0062082353|2.0|It was one of the worse looking books I have ever seen in my life.  The pages were not cut even, they were sticking out.  It would appear that this was a second book an should never have been sold.
B0053O89RY|5.0|This is such a good series.  There isn't a single character I don't like.  The story lines are hilarious and heart warming at the same time.  I hope this show is on for years to come.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|For some reason I cannot remember the story line for Bad Luck and Trouble.  I will have to go back to this one in the future.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A little slow to start but then I couldn't put it down. This is one of those rare books where I will truly miss the characters, they became a part of me while I read about them. This is a fantastic read.
B004DTLK8A|5.0|I've listened to Stratovarius for years, and couldn't imagine the sound with the new line up of musicians. Very impressed! It's nice the quality work has continued.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I now have all 5 season sets and enjoy the last as much as the first.  I recommend all sets.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I’m burned-out on Quentin Tarantino movies.  Considering the length of the movie it’s has a high return on your investment, but as predicable with QT movies it drags on and on.  Parts of this movie were so slow I could go to the kitchen to make myself and extra-strong cocktail and a sandwich without losing the thought of the scene.
B008220D7S|5.0|My husband and I laughed through the entire movie. As soon as it was over we both said we had to buy it. We have recommended this movie to all of our friends.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I truly enjoy this show, I came across it by accident and discovered I really like the cast and show. It is not just a crime show, you can see the interactions between the characters and truly get to see a great relationship. It is very obvious the crew enjoy working together.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|There is something about Quentin Tarantino that rubs me the wrong way. I keep watching his movies and I keep secretly hoping that I am not going to like them. So far, I have been consistently disappointed in that hope and, whatever my no doubt petty reasons are for harboring a mysterious grudge against the man, I have to admit, he makes pretty good movies. This movie was pretty good. Not as good as [[ASIN:B002T9H2LK Inglourious Basterds (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], in my opinion, but still pretty good. Quentin Tarantino is a good writer and, at the very least, his movies are always interesting, and there is never any cliche dialogue.<br /><br />The characters in the movie are, of course, very interesting. I believe Quentin Tarantino said in his Oscar acceptance speech that if his films are still remembered in a hundred years it will be for the characters he created. I think that is probably true. There are four characters that stand out in the movie. Calvin Candie as a detestable white plantation owner, and Stephen, his conniving African American servant, make excellent antagonists, and Dr. King Schultz and Django Freeman make excellent protagonists. Unfortunately, I felt like, of the four, Django was the least fleshed out. I would have liked to have seen more of his history (how did he get to be so good with a gun? how did he meet Broomhilda?). Broomhilda could have been fleshed out a bit more as well, but the acting was excellent all around.<br /><br />I also would have liked to have seen more humor in the movie. There is a scene fairly early on in the movie that was really hilarious, where a bunch of klansmen are out to get revenge on Dr. Schultz and Django, but they are all having trouble seeing out of the eye holes of their white sheets, and they have a long argument about what to do about it. I thought it was not only really funny, but a brilliant way to undercut the klan and make them look as ridiculous as they really are. The klan is usually portrayed as very menacing. I thought it was great to see them portrayed as a bunch of bumbling fools. Humor, I think, is often a much more powerful corrosive than anger. I wish there had been more scenes like that in the second half of the movie.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT. I was not entirely satisfied with the revenge aspect of the film. I am not sure how long it actually was, but it felt like at least the last hour of the film or so (perhaps a bit less) was a long bloodbath of revenge. I find Quentin Tarantino's rewriting of history in an effort to provide a kind of catharsis very interesting, but I thought it was more effective in Inglorious Basterds. The crescendo scene in Inglorious Basterds is more condensed and it just felt more satisfying to me. I was waiting for that cathartic moment at the end of this film and I did not feel like I really got it.<br /><br />I think that the people who are complaining that this was not an accurate depiction of slavery are missing the point to some degree. There is still a lot of anger about slavery in this country, as there should be, and it is not just in the African American community. I am not African American, but I am still angry about our history of slavery. This movie works the way most movies work: it condenses all of the evil of slavery into a few characters, gets the audience angry, and then releases that anger in a crescendo of violence. I understand the intention, I just do not think it was as effective as it was in Inglorious Basterds.<br /><br />One other disappointment I had was with the Broomhilda legend. It does not seem to me to be a real legend but that is not what disappointed me. The legend is set up as if it is meant to be a prefiguration of what is going to happen. Broomhilda has been set up on a mountain top, guarded by a dragon, and surrounded by the fires of hell. Siegfried goes to get her and must slay the dragon and pass through the fires of hell. I do not feel like Tarantino did enough to cash out that prefiguration. Presumably, the dragon would be Candie, but his death was too quick and easy, and perhaps the fires of hell were meant to foreshadow the dynamite, but Django does not pass through those fires. I wish Tarantino had more clearly worked out the parallels in the two stories. It would not have had to be literal. I was not expecting Django to walk through actual fire. I just felt like it was a set up that was never totally paid off.<br /><br />All that having been said, it was still a very entertaining movie. Quentin Tarantino seems to me to make movies mostly for the fun of it. The issues this film deals with are serious issues (racism, slavery, etc.) but those issues seem like more of a set up for a fun revenge flick than a serious examination of serious themes. Which is fine. I admit that I always have fun watching a Quentin Tarantino movie. Maybe that is why I resent him so much.<br /><br />EDIT 8/6/17: I am adding edits to a few of my reviews that have sort of stuck in my craw. I find my opinions about books and movies tend to shift as I have more time for reflection, as I encounter new books and movies that alter my taste, and so on. If I were rating this movie today I would give it a lower rating. I am actually not a huge Tarantino fan. His movies are too clever and they are basically just montages of tough guys engaging in lyrical repartees before violently murdering each other. The one Tarantino movie I can say without qualification that I liked was Inglorious Basterds and I also got some enjoyment out of the Kill Bill movies. But aside from those exceptions I have decided to take a heroic stand against the prevailing Zeitgeist and make my opinions about Tarantino a matter of public record. I will try to remain humble despite my obvious heroism.ation.

0374531269|4.0|A Long Way Gone captivates the life of a young boy in a time of war. Ishmael Beah takes the reader on an unimaginable journey that is a reality for many children around the globe. One can only see through Beah's eyes the terror that it must be to be a child soldier. Through out the book one can see Beah transform. He is a frightened boy that becomes a killing machine, and later realizes what has happened to him. This book is more than a story of a boy. It is the story of a generation. It is the effects of globalization, and it makes one wonder why people allow it to happen. Are the negative effects of globalization worth it?  I would recommend this book for globalization courses, and readers in general, because it shows one the ugly realities of globalization.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I was surprised how much I loved this book! I couldn't put it down once I started reading. I would definitely suggest this book!

B00B4804KS|5.0|Jurassic Park is perhaps my favorite film of all time. I remember I was 8 years old when it was first released and I was almost certain what I was seeing on the screen where without a doubt, real life dinosaurs. Considering I first wanted to become a paleontologist in first grade,prior to this films original release, it's safe to say with  spielberg's take on Crichton's ambitious novel,my interest in Dinosaurs has been sealed ever since.<br /><br />Now with the 3D release of Jurassic Park I get to relive that great childhood memory in a new format.<br />Is it worth the purchase?<br />If you have a 3D TV and have yet to purchase this film on standard bluray I would say go for it without hesitation.<br />The picture clarity and sound are restored very well. The audio more so than the video.<br />My favorite attention to detail is looking at the refrigerator (John Hammonds introduction scene)and reading the headline on the paper which says, \\"Aliens stole my face\\", and then behind Hammond a headline that says, \\"Dinosaurs on Mars!\\"<br />Perhaps Alan Grant and Ellie Sadler where huge fans of Weekly World Wews?<br />I've been watching this movie for nearly 20 years and have never been able to notice little things like that. The last bluray release to make me go wow for minor details such as that was the bluray version of the original Halloween.<br /><br />The 3D itself adds to the original experience but not by leaps and bounds. Theirs just enough pop out factor to notice it and just enough 3D depth to feel any immersion within the world of Jurassic Park. Yes I'm a little disappointed but not enough to feel like this release doesn't have any merit to it. That first scene where the score hits and you see the brachiosaurus in all it's glory I still cracked a smile.<br />When the T Rex first shows it's huge head devouring the remains of a goat it looked absolutely terrifying and gigantic in 3D.<br />In the end,Jurassic Park 3D takes you back to the island of Isla Nublar in style but I feel only the most hardcore fans of the franchise will be willingly to take the ride in 3D.<br />The 3D adds a nice subtle touch I admire as a fan but really does little to compete with other 3D titles out their.

0756404746|5.0|Review by Jill Williamson<br /><br />Here's a story about an innkeeper who agrees to tell his story to a scribe. He asks for three days to tell the story, and there are to be three books in this series, one for each day. The story is about a young boy, Kvothe, who is part of a traveling troupe, and how he survives when his parents are killed.<br /><br />Here's a book I'd heard tons about. I'm glad I finally read it. I loved it. I really did. It was long. Too long, really. But the story was never boring. I did get frustrated at the end when I realized Kvothe wasn't going to be able to finish his story in the pages I had left. Then I remembered the whole \\"I need three days to tell this story\\" thing, and that the book was the first in a trilogy. Oh yeah.<br /><br />This book is good. And I think all fantasy writers should read it at some point. Rothfuss is an excellent storyteller. There is a little foul language in this book, but it didn't bother me. For the most part this is a clean book. There are very serious subject matters in the story like mass murder and revenge. And there is some racy dialogue--funny and well-written, though. Regretfully, I went online and read reviews of book two, and I probably won't read on. I adore Kvothe as he is. And I don't want to read about him becoming a murder and a sexual rock star. So I'll stick with book one for this series. But the magic and storyworld and characters in book one were fabulous.<br /><br />This book also had a nice map. :-)
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I really enjoyed it and it didnt bother me at all that I had to read subtitles! You hardly notice
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Is not quite as user friendly as I would like.  Has a huge area of spelling errors in Romans 3:12-20 , around that area anyway.  I like that I was able to download the version I wanted tho.
B004GJYRPK|1.0|Was expecting Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets with both a Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy. Instead i received the standard Blu-Ray edition.<br />Still a good movie but not what I thought i bought bad selling Picture
0920668372|1.0|I added this book to my baby registry without actually reading it beforehand based on all the positive reviews. This book is the saddest thing I've ever read! I was crying my eyes out when I first read it. Why would anyone want to read this to their child?! It's incredibly creepy. I'd return it back in a second except amazon is charging me $3.99 for shipping it back. I think I'll just donate it. I want it out of my house!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app I only wish there were more free puzzles. I have tried a few different puzzle apps and this one is my favorite.
B0053B347M|4.0|This product works just like it said. Looks great. Has an on and off switch on the cord which is nice. Overall im satisfied.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Very funny. If your married, and near 40, and have kids. You'll see yourself in this movie. I enjoyed it.
1936608898|5.0|I am extremely overweight and I was desperate to find a way to start my way on getting back to the weight I needed to be. I picked up this book due to a recent discovery from my OBGYN that good health is 70% diet and 30% exercise. Now, how true those numbers are I'm not sure, but I believe that diet is the most important (of course exercise is necessary as well). Anyways, I picked the book up and it sat on my shelf for a few months, well maybe a year. I finally sat down and read it and couldn't believe I had waited so long! The science and research behind everything is amazing and makes sense. It totally transformed my way of eating. I began my Whole30 and just in the 30 days I lost 30 pounds! The food is so good, it tastes so different than the old junk I used to eat. Food becomes so much more enjoyable and you're not dependent on a high from sugar or happiness form junk. This book has certainly changed my life forever and I will never go back to my junk eating. I also like the fact that I don't have an overflowing pantry with lots of boxed stuff, I don't throw stuff away nearly as much, and I have a good cycle of food going in and out of my fridge. I actually enjoy grocery shopping now and trying new things. It used to be very hard to not go out to eat, just stop at that drive thru for a quick meal that was also satisfying to my cravings. I love to cook now and my husband loves the food too!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a while and it's a true story! It explains Grandin's brilliance and inspiring cause. Viewers young and old will enjoy this entertaining movie that leaves an impression.

B008CLI4N4|5.0|Update: If you did not see the series on HBO, I strongly recommend getting the DVDs for the season rather than watching them on line from Amazon or Netflix. I watched the first season and there was so much I missed because I did not have a firm grasp on the relations between the characters. All the little family trees helped, but not much. I watched the complete first season over again, and it made far more sense. I did not attend to the \\"extras\\" in the review. I suggest they are \\"fair to good\\". There is a voice-over commentary for almost all episodes, except that the quality is uneven. If the writer(s), director, or producer are commenting, the value is very good. If, as in the second episode, the commentary is by three child actors, the commentary is almost worthless, unless you have an adolescent in your audience.<br /><br />Given all the other reviews, it is hard for me to think of anything new to say about this celebrated HBO series which as some strong similarities to the 2 season historical drama \\"Rome\\". It seems the writer has \\"borrowed\\" a bit from just about everyone, most heavily relying on the real history of the Plantagenets and the War of the Roses, although there is little evidence that the dialogue owes anything to Shakespeare's great plays about that history. Of course, there is also a strong flavoring of Tolkien, as if you needed Sean Bean (Boromir in LOTR) in the lead role of Ned Stark to tell you that.<br /><br />When I began watching, I had high expectations, which were temporarily deflated through the third to about the seventh episode. I yearned for more back story, which the narrative gave out in drips and drabs. I anticipated that the king would die in some way during the first season, and the fact that Sean Bean does not reappear in season 2 give away some of the plot.<br /><br />Another element which enlivened my interest is that Peter Dinklage's character, Tyrian Lannister, begins to appear more regularly by episode 7, and starts having an active effect on events. Even in this season, there is no mystery to why Dinklage got several acting awards for his role in this series. Aside from Bean and Dinklage, the acting is sound, if not necessarily inspired. If I were to identify one actor and role I began to anticipate, it was Emilia Clarke, who plays the exiled Daenerys Targaryen.<br /><br />The season succeeded in what may have been its two primary objectives. I am now anxious to see what happens in Season 2 (especially to see more of Dinklage) and to buy some of the books by George R. R. Martin, on which the series is based. It is this deep history which made Tolkien's books so magical and which works for Martin's story as well.active effect on events.

B009PODB76|5.0|Delta is a great pop singer - highly underrated. So much better than other more popular singers.  Taka a look at her Believe Again Tour on You Tube.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Very funny especially if you just turned 40 and have kids.  A lot of great parts...!  I'd recommend to watch
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Very good and engaging story. This movie is good for both family movie night or just watching alone. Cinematography was excellent.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was completely awesome and the part where Rowley and Abigail were a couple was the best part to me. Greg is a big dork, and he's just jealous because he's single and he didn't have an official date to the dance because it was him, Rowley, and Abigail. I think he should do more than take a girl to a restaurant, he should like do something else special for her. I just don't think that he's ready for any relationships, because he really only has 1 friend, and that's Rowley.<br /><br />  Sincerely, Kiera Smith
B001FB55H6|1.0|Personally I don't rewatch films very often. for me, a very long extended cut that puts the film at 3hrs (of for films like lord of the rings, much more than 3hrs), not having the theatrical cut included (which literally EVERY OTHER extended/directors cut I've ever owned does) is a big drawback. Its nice to watch a few times, but I you really feel that 3hr run time and it makes the whole movie feel too long. I was disappointed when I realized there was no theatrical cut and since this is one of my favorite films, it means I now need to buy the regular copy as well...shame on WB for cutting out the theatrical version.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie kept my attention throughout and had enough action, drama, and laughs to make it well worth my time. Great movie, I would highly recommend.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Because that is the reason I choose my books. One will see it on examining the titles on the list.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I really enjoyed the game.  It kept my total  focus and I strategized how to improve my score.  I had fun!
B00079FUI6|4.0|it's on Netflix so why would I buy it?  Other than cool old shows like Kung-Fu and Route 66 I'm not buying DVDs or advanced subscriptions- I just wait for everything to come on Demand.  You're a sucker to do otherwise... eventually it's all going on Demand and now I can watch what is available already.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The characters are despicable, conniving, and evil. There is little joy to be had in reading this book. But, it gets under your skin, and keeps you going, until you reach the end feeling both sad and irritated.
6304458355|5.0|The movie is something the whole family can watch together.  It's very imaginative and interesting.  I would highly recommend it.
B007ZMD14I|4.0|I am really liking this cd. I'm a huge Myles Kennedy/ Alterbridge fan and this cd rocks...I like Slash a lot too and his guitar work on this one is impressive but this appears to me to be Myles baby. He wrote all the songs!!! Should be titled Myles Kennedys Apocalyptic love (feat. Slash).

0061950726|4.0|This is the story of two people; seventeen year old Molly Ayer, who is almost out of the foster care system when she sis sentenced to community service. Her service is to help ninety-one year old Vivian Daly clean out her attic. In that attic, is Vivian's past; a past full of secrets. They are two people so different yet so much the same as they begin to open up to one another and let each other in.<br /><br />I love stories that have history attached to them and this one is not different. I never learned of the orphan trains that brought thousands of homeless children to the Midwest. I wanted not to like Molly but as she assists Vivian she becomes a different person. One that is wanted and needed. And Vivian learns much from Molly too. I would give this one five stars, but felt it ended too abruptly and I wanted more. I really did. One thing though, I will spend time in my library and research more about the orphan trains. I found it useful that the end of the book had an interview with the author and a short history with photos.
B008602KQI|4.0|I saw this in the theatre and I enjoyed it on my PC as well. I think this movie is a good for family with a mix of suspense and violence.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|I liked it because the farmers flooded the secret place.<br />I would definitely recommend it for Birthday parties.  All of the kids at my party loved it!  I even made a Fantastic Mr. Fox sign to put on the wall in the room where we watched it.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|Gave as it birthday gift to a 10 year old boy who was thrilled to receive it and had it all put together and added it to all his other Lego products; has made up 'scenes' using the product.  I would highly recommend it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a great book. The struggles of the characters were well written. I wish I could have had this book as a teenager.
0515123447|4.0|There are some real clever things in this story.  It's fun and yet not really intellectually challenging.  A perfect vacation book.
B008RLTUUA|3.0|A lot of good information the average consumer of drug products would never know, and would probably be happier never to know.  But the author makes the same points over and over again.  A 20-page essay would have been more than sufficient to cover the topic.
6305212112|5.0|A classic indeed, a great story line and excellent acting, One of my favorites i would watch again and again!!!!!!
B003VXMMTK|1.0|I would not recommend watching this show, especially if you enjoy period movies or are a big fan of Jane Austen type films. It jumped around in odd places, a bit slow in others and just had a bad story line in general.
B00AEFXKOO|3.0|The disc is fine.  Technically there are no problems.  I received the item in a timely manner.  The only thing that I'm disappointed about is the widescreen format.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Grandson got me interested in this.  It's time consuming fun.  Seems to be some strategy thinking involved.  Something that he and I can relate to.  It's funny when he is &#34;instructing&#34; me on what to do next.  Enjoyable!
B00296A4F4|4.0|I'd heard about Glee for quite awhile so I decided to try it on Amazon Prime.  It is a fun show that doesn't take it self too seriously.  The music and dancing are great.
B00061QK02|5.0|Came as described.  Can't beat the movie itself.  Maybe one of the top 5 comedies of this generation.  Great one-liners.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|If AS-3 were still available, the AS-5 would rate a 3 star. Too thick, takes months to cook in. I moved on to Zalman ZM-STG1, which is painted on.<br />I really don't understand why AS-3 was discontinued.

B00AZL3PBK|1.0|it is so easy to die and the key button things just don't work. I'll click the forward button and it wont do anything until I touch it a few times and when I try to stop moving it keeps going.
B00C5ZNUCS|2.0|I saw Ghost live about a year ago when they were on tour with Opeth and Mastodon and they were a fantastic act. The music from their first album was great and they do a great job whenever they cover a song but this album just wasn't up to the same sort of bar they were hitting leading up to this release. There was a lot of anticipation for this album and a lot of buzz behind them after their first release and all the touring they had done, they gained a lot of attention in the metal world and outside the metal world. This album feels like it dropped a notch because of it, they got a big name fancy pants producer and got Dave what's his face's attention and then they put out this let down of an album. It's very repetitive, overly simplistic, goofy sounding, and poorly mixed. Also the satan thing is just way overplayed on this album, their was a point where it was sort of a amusing but that was long ago. At the same time it beats most popular music out there. Next album drop the fancy pants producer for someone who actually knows something about mixing and producing a good record and tone down the satan stuff a few notches, so that they can get back to playing good music in silly costumes.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|First, it's missing the one song that's the best one on the show (just my opinion) &#34;Fade Into You&#34; :( The CD case even has the little round sticker on the plastic wrapping promoting the song.  Amazon did send me an explanation and a credit to download the song, which I haven't done yet.<br /><br />Second, while all the songs are pleasant enough, some more enjoyable than the others, I believe I prefer listening to them while watching the TV show.  For some reason they just sound better to me.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Found the book to much different than I expected.  I would recommend to friends and also to a book discussion group.
B008476HBM|4.0|If the Seinfeld TV series was based on the premise that nothing happens, then Jane Austin was his precursor. Nothing really happens but it is told in such lovely language and interesting conversations that you just sort of roll with it.
B0042UEU8M|5.0|This is actually the second time I have rented this movie. It is a great movie. Love the emotional bond on it.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|It was an adjustment at first, but after a few minutes it is wonderful to see this fantastic musical brought to the screen. The actors were stupendous. It was great that they could project their emotions more rather than the concern about just projecting the voice as it is on stage.
B005BRS8Z6|1.0|I cannot believe people like this book. It is full of crap and poorly written. I would give it zero stars if I could.
0316113514|5.0|The educational, physiological, and social outcomes were against the odds of standard practice with the current educational and health care systems. As a Christian, this secular book lines up with basic Biblical principles on many levels. My wife wanted to know why she needed to exercise. First, it’s good for your brain; and as a secondary bonus, it helps your body. As we near retirement, who wants to start declining in either? I believe that this should be a “Must Read” book.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The characters were well defined.  The kind of book that you can't put down.  I would reqcommed to friends and my book discussion group.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I can use my Kindle to manage my page just like if I was on FB? SWEET. I can do EVERYTHING. Love it love it love it!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I reached for this book with curiosity. As I was reading, I kept thinking of my own approach to discussed issues and personal experiences. Some of the situations resonated with me closely and I cannot agree more that we, women, can be very competitive and critical of each other. The book also made me more self-aware of how I look at my own career and goals and I found a few areas in which I could easily improve.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and I will keep returning to my highlighted quotes regularly.
B0016OLC5Q|3.0|Into the Wild was very depressing to see the young man Chris do this to really get away from his parents abusive relationship that not only messed him up, but also his sister.  The parents should of noticed what was happening to both their children and got them counseling, rather than push the children both onto things they did not want and living a lie as parents how much in Love they were, but were really a psychological mess themselves.<br /><br />Sean Penn as Director followed what the young man did and why perfectly and the cast Emile Hirsch as Chris and Marcia Gay Harden as his mother with John Hurt as his father were well cast in their roles.  Along with the rest of the cast who are big name stars made the movie a thing to watch and learn from these parents horrific mistakes of not noticing what they were doing to their own children the way they both acted.  The mother especially should of been the one who saw that the two children were not happy what-so-ever with their lives, let alone the parents way of treating them.<br /><br />Here is the link for a lesson all parents can learn:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016OLC5Q/ref=wtls_list_pr_11
B005HJWWW8|5.0|It does the job quietly and consistantly then any other device i've tried.  Boosts my music, tablet, computer needs, when the power output from my toys is less then I expected from earlier models of years before.<br /><br />Bottom line, adds a refreshing way to down out the world.
B005KGPC4S|4.0|GOOD Movie.. Not your typical Kevin Smith film.. But certainly good.. I look forward to his possible high budget ending to the flick if he ever decides to make it.. Check out Smodcast.com for all of his great podcasts!!
B001NOQI3U|5.0|I love Barbara Streisand's singing!  She did a superb job acting in this movie.  This would be a great movie to show to a Women's Study class in college to stimulate conversation around allowing women to be educated.......what a great improvement that has been for Women!
B008K9UZY4|4.0|My kids love this game :) They are always playing it - every weekend.  It is a classic Sonic game :)  Will have to try it sometime :)
B008CLI4N4|4.0|I liked it very much.  Enough to immediately order the 2nd season.  It has what is so sadly lacking in most of the drivel that comes out of Hollywood these days.  A real story line.  Charactors that are more than one dimensional (at least some of them).  Complex subplots.  And, just like in the real world, the good guys don't always win.  In hours of programming, I never had a moment of boredom.  In addition, the acting & direction are excellent, the sets, costuming, supurb.  If the option existed, I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.  There was nothing about it I didn't like.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that whatever that magic something is that elevates a film to instant classical greatness wasn't quite there.  That said, I would recommend the series highly to anyone who enjoys costume drama.  They won't be disappointed.
B007REW8DO|5.0|I purchased this CD because I had heard her song &#34;Jar of Hearts&#34; and loved it. There are so many good songs on this that it is fast becoming my favorite!!
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This is a great addition to my Disney collection. I love the classics of the Disney movies. It will be fun to watch these with my grandchildren.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I run this from time to time to clean junk out of system. It only takes a few seconds. Nice app.
B00821OUT6|5.0|Love it this new show!! Cant wait for season 3 to come out. I love the whole alien thing and between this and walking dead I cant leave my Tv. This is so far some of the best stuff they have come out with. I just wish that Surface would come back to TV too!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love the ease of play.  My grandson loves it, too.  This game is easy,  It find it calming after a long day.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|After viewing the complete 1st season, I immediately ordered the 2nd.  It did not disappoint.  The story, subplots, charactorization, acting, directing, etc. lived up to the promise of the 1st.  As with the 1st season, I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if that option existed.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys well done costume dramas.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Loved this movie, the prequle was pretty awesome as well.  Here's hoping that they make another one...the stories will never die !
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This is a good edition to my collection. My grandson will love these movies when he gets older. Thank you
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Sounds like Soundgarden.  Gotta love that.  Just as strong as Superunknown in my humble opinion.  Go out and buy it.  Don't rip them off.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Good advice. King delivers pragmatic advice without boring the reader. Reading list at the end is also useful. Highly recommend.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts out so easy, but soon becomes challenging.  I find it frustratingly fun.  I thought there was no logic to it until I got to the higher levels.
0802473156|4.0|This book will be useful for my next relationship. I can see, by reading this book, the silly things I do. It really breaks down the basics of love and life!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I'm referring both to certain characters AND the author.  This entire series has me on the edge of my seat, and I haven't actually allowed myself to finish A Dance with Dragons--because I know there isn't another book! (Yet.)<br /><br />While a couple of the books in the middle fell sort of flat, you can tell that the story is starting to (finally) come together (ish) in this one.<br /><br />I am eagerly waiting for the next book!
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is a great story about one of the greatest presidents, the US ever had. Excellent movie subjects. Thank you
B00899F0G8|4.0|Love this show! Very entertaining despite the fact that the concept is fairly unbelievable. Definitely a kind of guilty pleasure but I can't stop watching and there's no harm in that!
B003H4RDZQ|2.0|David Sedaris is a funny man.  However not as funny apparently when reading is work vs. listening to him.  I could only get through the first two stories.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I would have given more stars but I can't get lots of points and the other stuff cost too much to buy with the little point you receive....fix it and you get 5 stars...
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Haven't really listened to Boz Scaggs for a while so was really pleased with this CD.  Some pretty cool singing and interpretations.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I'm reviewing these out of order, as I've already finished what is available of the series...<br />But---I tore through this book, just as I did the first one!<br /><br />I have not had a series grab my attention like this in a very, very long time.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I never thought I would want to read any of this series, but there was a snowstorm and i was looking for something to read and I got hooked on the Hunger Games so I thought I would read the next two.  Catching fire was good.  The 3rd book was a very hard read.
B000FC146C|5.0|I read this book in the 80's, but never finished it.  I tried it again and I just love it.  The characters , the plot everything about it was good, beyond good.  I really like real long books I feel I'm getting my moneys worth.  If you like family sagas and this is not just a family saga but so much more you have to try it.<br /><br /> SC Claw
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fast reading held my interest thru the whole book . I would read more by Suzanne Collins. The ending was not what I exported.<br /><br />Cjschmiedeke
B005S9ELVC|4.0|I went in with an open mind and was entertained throughout. The movie never seems to lag and has pretty good action sequences. The acting pulls no punches and the story moves along rapidly from the start. The script isn't Goodfellas or Godfather, the directing is a bit more textbook, but that's what makes it fun. There's never a slow moment where I wish the scene was over like in many other talky movies. I would compare it to The Untouchables I guess. Again, that's not a bad thing, some movies take themselves too seriously and bore you to death with over-written scenes. The dialogue was crisp and funny as well.
B00B2TUKI0|4.0|I really liked this new CD.  Some of the tracks are a little different - some interesting choices.  Nice to hear Ray Charles songs done in a real mellow voice.  She's growing in stature for me.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|I've been trying to get my hands on this for about five months. There just wasn't any available. Let me tell you it was worth the wait. It's a great size, good weight and does what's its suppose to do. The only reason I can't give it a five star rating is because the blade edge was really bad out of the box. After a few minutes of dressing the blade I was shaving hairs off my arm. Got a chance to do some chopping on a downed pine tree on my property last week and I was very impressed. It's got the perfect weight to get through it quickly and held it edge very well. If your looking for a great survival or bushcraft knife look no further. This is it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I actually have not finished this book.  Flew through The Hunger Games, no problem on the scong book but am having a very hard time getting through this book.  Not good.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Great movie love the Resident Evil series I enjoy the graphics and love the the film very cool and will watch it more and more
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book really grabs you at first and you think it is fabulous book but towards the end it almost seems like another writer took over. Very disappointed in the ending. Our book club read it and all had the same feeling.<br /><br />What happened? If the ending is set for a sequel it still could have been written better.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved this book so much I finished it in one day and I miss it already!!! I can't wait for the one
0307730697|5.0|This is truly a beautiful story of the redemptive power of God in the face of great adversity.  Adam Brown was fearless because of the mighty power of God in his life.  This is recommended reading for anyone!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I think E.L. James is a 16 year old child and wrote during detention. Couldn't get through more than 15 pages.  What a terribly written book. No charm, no cleverness and no sophistication.<br />Fooey.
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|I have trouble using it.  I always have trouble getting to the pad where I should be writing.  I don't think this is for me.  My neighbor's young daughter liked it a lot.
B00280LYIC|5.0|10 year old is now addicted. Used to pull teeth to read... now I can't pull him away! Try it out!
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I really tried to like this book, but the more I read, the more I was mystified by all the 5 star reviews. I spent 133 pages with two tired old characters, who have a geriatric crush on each other, whose names are so blandly similar I had to keep looking back to remember who is who, walking up and down hundreds of metallic stairs in search of a plot. Somewhere in first few hundred stairs a good vs evil theme awkwardly emerges, with a nemesis, from the dreaded IT department - everyone hates IT of course - and I'm going to guess the eventual hero, a prodigy mechanical tech who can fix anything. Is it a war of wits between these two? I'm not going to stick around and find out. This is the driest book I've ever read.
B00846REIS|5.0|I didn't know what to expect, thinking it was a another copy cat book of fifty, but I was so wrong.<br />It was better.<br />Hot, hot, hot.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This is such a great movie. John C Reilly is great voicing the main character. One of the best Disney movies I have seen in a while. Highly recommend.
0385349947|5.0|My Daughter is having her first daughter my first granddaughter wanted her to be brought in to twenty first century gave as a gift I am sure they will enjoy for generations to come!!!!!!!!!!!<br />“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love Calculator Plus!  It does all the functions that I need and more.  I highly recommend it to seniors that need a calculator at their fingertips with digits large enough to be read without glasses.
B007PKOKTK|4.0|My kids enjoy this one at Easter and it's not too juvenile.  It's nice to have a fun movie for spring break/Easter.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|While I really love the ap, as I use it both on my phone and on my Kindle Fire... I am not giving it a 5 star due to the fact that I can not email from it. While you should be able to send send your note as an attachment or even straight from the ap itself. It does not go through. I have tried several times. So, if that ends up ever working, I will change the rating.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I have always been a big fan of the Lord of the Ring and the Hobbit ever since I first read them back in the 1970's.  The previous movies were beyond my expectations and so is the Hobbit.  I am eagerly waiting for the next one. I have already watched it at least 10 tomes.
B00884GR0W|5.0|dis game is de bomb first of all this is very in Delhi and detailed I'll play dis game till the new update form mc comes out
B00BEU3NI6|4.0|This was fun and fast  Love the different phases .would play another game like this taught it to my neighbor
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this app!! its great and i absolutely love the updates cuz u never no where ur going next!
B0011ZVVOM|3.0|Not as good as &#34;El Camino&#34; or &#34;Brothers&#34;, but it's better than &#34;Thickfreakness&#34;. It's for the Black Keys fans who are just looking for more of this band.
030758836X|2.0|After so long on the top of the best seller list, I anticipated a much better story than this turned out to be.<br />I would not have bought it, had I had a clue.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|This is strictly a review of the package, not the movie. I bought some Disney classics from Amazon- The Lion King(3D), Finding Nemo(3D) which were priced in the $23 range, Cinderella, Peter Pan, Snow White which were all priced less than $25. It is really shameful that Disney is selling this limited package for more than $30. In my opinion, BD+DVD package should not be more than $25. Packages including 3D BD should include 2D BD, DVD and a digital copy. A standalone 3D BD should not be more than $15-20. If this is the trend from Disney, I will refrain from buying their movies from now. I dont buy any package which includes an UV copy which is a total ripoff and I have to add packages like this to that list.<br /><br />Hopefully, this was an experiment by Disney for this movie only. The only way big entities like Disney pay attention to us is if we dont buy this package at this price.
B0000062Y2|2.0|The CD was great but I ordered gift wrap and did not get it and I did pay for it
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|Do not buy this app. The levels are hard and the controls are horrible all this will get you is buyers remorse.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Someone a arts were good others aren't B but it's a great<br />Book overall would recommend this to someone enjoy
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have liked what I've read in this Bible but I didn't seem to be able to look up verses or other historical events further ahead than I had currently read. I haven't really explored it too much but will attempt to see if I can jump ahead or to any point I would like to reference other than having to read the Bible in it's entirety. Not that it wouldn't be good to do that but time permitting..
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I loved the game. I take my time so this was perfect to come back to from time to time.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|DM has been making albums for more than 30 yrs, some good, some perfected, some not so good - this one puts them back on the top of their game, again.... simply one of the best...
B001FB4VZS|5.0|The only part of this season I didn't like was the lana part I mean why do they have to make her into a super person like superman I swear lana is too weird man. Like the writers for this show just couldn't resist bringing lana back like the show was so much better with her gone. But other than that this season tells of clark finally coming to the daily planet saving people in metropolis
1616550414|5.0|I bought this just to display and haven't opened it, HOWEVER, I did download the book and the content is FANTASTIC! Artwork, concepts, stories, and more. It's just awesome, hands down. Feels like a text book in your hands. I hope they do another one at 50 years!
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was on of the best books ever! Better than the movie by far! Makes you wonder what happens next.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I chose to rate it a 5 because it is all I expected and it takes decent pictures. I'd recommend it to anyone that is looking for an easy to use, good quality and hassle free.
1594744475|5.0|Haven't had a chance to try all the recipes yet, but the book itself gives me a lot of inspiration and decorative techniques! My 1 year old niece loves the pictures and i always pulling it of from the shelf of cookbooks.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was ok, not as good as the first, but an easy read.  I would recommend it for easy reading.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|The writing was authentic and the casting and acting well done. Jamie Foxx was something to see in the roll and the actor who taught him all he knew was superb, I thought.  Leonardo Dicaprio surprised me with his understanding of the character and its portrayal.  He is all grown up.
B000FA675C|5.0|Actually I had read the precursor to Dan Brown's work years prior to Code's publication but seeing all the furor over similar places, ideas was just unbelievable!  The book is fast paced ; a real spine tingler!  A centuries old secret is about to be revealed...and the Catholic Church would prefer the secret remain hidden.  A number of unsolved mysteries surface in the reading of this book and the reader will have to decide whether they like the author's interpretation or not.  If you enjoy art history, early christian art or just history's mysteries, this is a book for you.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I like Fun. because they are still mainstream but have enough flair to have folk tune in their songs. I especially like &#34;Carry On&#34;. Great album for $5
B0064MPXFA|3.0|We like to get into a show and watch an episode or two a night.  I really like shows that I look forward to watching.  This one was difficult to get into; in fact, I think I've watched the first couple episodes two or three times over the course of a year trying to get into it, but never did.  This time we stuck with it, and towards the end of the season it gets better; a bit more of a story for Alicia Florrick instead of just a courtroom drama.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I liked this book, but it was not quite as good as the first, that one had me a little hot under the collar.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The writing, acting and stories never disappoint. This is such a quality show. Excellent!!!!! Who knew the end of the world has such great writing.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Can't give it enough stars. Two journeys through like that end up a full circle. This is a book u don't want to put down!!
B00B97TMIE|5.0|This band has awesome melodies, harmonies, and bass line. Really nice to listen to. I especially like &#34;Radioactive&#34; and &#34;Amsterdam&#34; Recommend the this deluxe version as you will want to hear more of them
0061537969|5.0|Rarely have I come across a work where the perspective is so creatively nonhuman, and humanistic at the same time. Garth Stein gets at the heart of the absurdity and joy of human relationships, as only a loyal, loving, canine companion could.
B001DUDKEY|3.0|The movie is well acted. It is the typical Jane Austin plot and moves a bit slowly. Three stars because I didn't particularly care for the main character's sad demeanor through most of the movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|If you are thinking about reading these books, you should just go ahead and do it. Right now. Preferably have the whole trilogy handy.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Do not miss this one.  How many of these stories have gone untold, forgotten?  We must remember them to honor them.
B009O2XY12|4.0|It is a great game to kill time with.  I enjoy playing the game occassionally, sometimes it is too easy.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|Robert Redford shines as the sole survivor of an attack at work.  As he unravels the mystery of who the murderers are, we are taken on a journey of intrigue and who's who?
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down! With every unexpected twist and turn, it is such a quick read because you will not be able to put it down!
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is a great but challenging book.  The events the narrator talks about that a 12 year old soldier sees is outrageous.  Seeing drugs, murders, using guns as a twelve year old in war at times can be hard to handle but the book is not horribly intense.  This book is a difficult read and should not be opened to young eyes, because of the events and the insensitivity.  This book has a lot to teach readers and should be praised for the truth it portrays in our real world today.  It is important to open our eyes outside of our bubble and really see what is going on in other countries and what we can do to help.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is quite fun to play. A worthy challenge of strategy skills wrapped up in a novel concept using balloons and monkeys.
B0098460O4|5.0|I think Jonathan & Charlotte are the youngest In history to sing so good they are both making history great job come on 16 and 17 years old geeeeeeeeeeesh can you believe it, Ride on Jonathan an Carlotte
0307388719|3.0|\\"Winston's War, Churchill, 1940-1945,\\" written by Max Hastings, Published by Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 2009.<br /><br />Max Hastings is one of the best military historians writing today. His book \\"OVERLORD\\" is one of the classic accounts of the Allies fighting in Europe from the Normandy invasion through the Falaise Gap in August 1944. Mr. Hastings has been able to take a mountain of factual information from his research and weave it into a seamless narrative of some historical signifiance. It worked in \\"OVERLORD;\\" it does not work here.<br /><br />The problem is Winston S. Churchill. The British Prime Minister and Minister of Defense was a man of great strategic vision. His speeches and his writing after Dunkirk are widely credited with saving Great Britain in her hour of need. He saw the threat Hitler's Germany presented to his country before anyone else; and he suffered for it politically. Yet during the war Churchill's strategic vision deserted him so many times that Hastings' compliments seem forced.  He wrote, \\"Churchill's grand vision of the war was superb.\\" p. 360. Resumes that begin with Gallipoli and end up defending the bloody Italian mountain campaign will not win you many jobs as a strategist. Events in Churchill's life that Hastings is forced to write about often undermine the story Hastings wants to tell of the greatest ever British political leader.<br /><br />One minor correction, the picture between pages 430 and 431 of Admiral William D Leahy, Alan Brooke, Hastings Ismay and George Marshall incorrectly lists U.S. Admiral Ernest King as Admiral Leahy. Note to the editors: Admiral William Leahy is authorized to wear the right shoulder \\"aiguillette\\" as an aide to President Roosevelt; Admiral King is not.<br /><br />Two notes on Allied strategy. First, Churchill insisted until virtually the end of the war that the British Army in Europe be granted the highest strategic and logistic priority. Churchill's views were eagerly followed by British C.I.G.S.Alan Brooke and British 21st Army Group Commander, Field Marshal Bernard L. Montgomery. Hastings wrote, \\"British attempts to ignore their own impoverishment and retain a giant's role in the world inspired pity among their American friends, contempt among their American enemies.\\" p. 419. It mattered little what most Americans thought. Only General Dwight Eisenhower's opinion really mattered and he usually sided with the British, at least until March 28, 1945. One gets a picture of General Eisenhower standing on the banks of the Rhine River in March 1945 with C.I.G.S. Alan Brooke, literally begging the British Field Marshal for a chance to \\"disperse\\" his forces, to unleash the Bradley's American Army into central Germany. Brooke agreed but it was far too little, far too late. There were only 40 odd days left in the war. In \\"Armageddon,\\" Hastings wrote, \\"Montgomery's most serious weakness ... stemmed from a refusal to acknowledge that in north-west Europe it was now essential for the British to defer to the overwhelming dominance of the United States (Army).\\" p. 27. Montgomery never did force himself to accept the obvious, but that was not his job. British wartime strategy came from the top down. It came from Winston Churchill and his Chiefs of Staff and they routinely insisted on fighting the Americans tooth and nail for logistic and strategic priority for the British Army in Europe.<br /><br />Second, the Italian campaign was the longest running argument between the Anglo-American Allies. The British supported it and tried to get more U.S. soldiers and ships committed to the campaign. The Americans disliked the whole Mediterranean theater and especially the campaign in Italy because of the terrible mountainous terrain. British official Harold Macmillan wrote, \\"The more one sees of this (Italian) peninsula, the less suited it seems for modern military operations.\\" p. 357. This was obvious to any first year officer cadet. But it was apparently not obvious to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his military advisors who berated the Americans time and again over operations in Italy. Two of the strongest proponents of continued operations in Italy were C.I.G.S. Alan Brooke and Mediterranean Theater Commander Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson. But we now know that they did not support operations in Italy at all and, in fact, were of the opposite view. Alan Brooke told U.S. historian Forrest Pogue, \\"... There is no doubt that Winston had a Balkan liking ... and he used to make matters rather difficult for me with Marshall with statements he would make, which Marshall would often think were inspired by me and they were not ... I couldn't go to him (Marshall) and say I don't agree with a word my Prime Minister is saying.\\" C.  Catherwood, Winston Churchill, p. 260. And Sir Henry Wilson said, \\"... I knew that strategically that was the only way (Southern France)... None of us liked the offensive against Italy really, against those mountains.\\" C. Catherwood, p. 261. British Intelligence Officer Sir Kenneth Strong confirms Wilson's statement. \\"Churchill's obsession with the \\"underbelly\\" theory has always struck me as a strategic aberration. General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson ... told me early in 1944 that he also favored the American view, but said that it was difficult for him to oppose the Prime Minister's policy.\\" Sir Kenneth Strong, Intelligence at the Top, p. 130. Allied strategy in Italy was being determined, not by the best military minds available, but by an amateur politician bent on getting his own way, as Alan Brooke once put it,'to spite the Americans.'<br /><br />At conferences in Cairo and Teheran Churchill chose to fight the Overlord battle with the Americans just one more time. It was a huge mistake. Presidential advisor Harry Hopkins had warned Churchill to back off or be prepared to go it alone at Teheran. Churchill refused to listen and paid the price. Roosevelt had tired of listening to Churchill's rants. He refused numerous requests for private meetings with the British Prime Minister. Churchill liked to blame Roosevelt's casual socializing for his lack of free time, but Hastings correctly points out \\"... that such evasion(s) reflected policy rather than 'mischances.'\\" p. 348.<br /><br />Churchill had overplayed the British hand throughout WW II. He got the headlines he wanted from the British press and this in turn inspired a reasonable war effort from the British people. Hastings wrote, \\"... the United States, its leaders and people alike still overestimated the wealth of Churchill's nation. Few grasped the extent of its moral, strategic and financial exhaustion.\\" p. 443. In Bernard L. Montgomery, the British people had a brilliant field marshal who never lost a battle, and whose battles all went exactly as he had planned them. Financially, there was seldom the slightest hint of long-term British fiscal doom covered by the press during the war. British and Americans shared an overly optimistic future for the British Empire and the British economy. These opinions were not divined by reading the tea leaves, but by reading British newspapers.<br /><br />It was all part of Prime Minister Winston S. Churchill's war winning strategy. British economic and military power were hyped and exaggerated far beyond their actual war-time performances. Neither American military or economic aid was seen as critical by the average British subject. \\"... Only a third of those (British) questioned held favorable views of Americans... Americans were actually held in lower esteem than Italians. Yet nine of ten Britishers thought well of Russia and the Russians.\\" Peter Lyon, Eisenhower, p. 278.<br /><br />Hastings writes, \\"There is an escapable pathos about Churchill's predicament in the last year of the war... His engagement with armies became ... that of a tourist, because he could no longer much influence their movements.\\" p. 482. Yet on March 31, 1945 Churchill wrote Eisenhower a letter complaining bitterly about Eisenhower's decision to reinforce Bradley with Simpson's Ninth U.S. Army which had been attached to Montgomery's 12th British Army Group. British complaints went all the way to the Combined Chiefs in Washington which forced George Marshall to ask Eisenhower to explain his decisions. There were barely 40 days left in the war. The Americans hoped to get in at least one full-scale offensive before the war ended, if they could just get the British out of the way. The last large American offensive which had full British approval went back to Operation Cobra in the Carentan at the end of July 1944. Montgomery usually gets blamed for his intransigence with the Americans, but the real culprit was P.M. Churchill and his refusal to see a reduced role for the dying British Empire in a post-war world. Max Hastings is forced to struggle with Churchill's flawed strategic vision throughout his book. The reader keeps his fingers crossed, but he already knows the ending will not be a happy one.
