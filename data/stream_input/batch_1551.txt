0142418471|5.0|I wasn't expecting this book to be so homosexual. I loved it. Even though half of the characters were homosexual, the story doesn't revolve around them dealing with their gayness. They are shown as regular teens with regular teen problems.<br /><br />All the characters had depth. Tiny was quite a character. He's a huge, as in large, flamer who writes his own musical about his life and is also the star of the football team.<br /><br />The varying styles of writing between the authors did well with their alternating chapters from different Will Graysons' perspectives. I thought the lowercase fit well with that Will Grayson. I enjoyed the interview between the authors found in the back of the book.<br /><br />The use of music and bands was done well. I found myself googling the songs and bands as well as trying to come up with the melody to Tiny's musical's songs.<br /><br />After reading this I want to read more from both authors, as well as queer YA. I read Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist a few years ago and liked that a lot.<br /><br />I give this novel a 5/5.

0553386794|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was the first true high fantasy I have read. It took me a little time to get into it at first though. The mention of so many names and bloodlines and the geography of a completely new continent pushed me away at first, but it didn't take long for me to get the hang of this world Martin has created. The characters he creates have so much depth. None of them are one-sided and you get to read from many of their perspectives. One of the only things I disliked was the ending. I don't feel this novel in itself was a good story. It was a good part of a story. It was excellent storytelling, but If there was no sequel this story was left completely open without any closure. I understand why they created this into a television series as opposed to a film. There wasn't a clear climax. All the stories of the different characters peak at different points and then peak again multiple times.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This is a comprehensive review of Volume 1 and 2.<br /><br />The story isn't new. Boy meets girl. Crazy circumstances keep them apart. And sorry, no sex, kids. But, ahh, Hoover wove this with poetic helpings of inspiration from her favorite band, The Avett Brothers. Their lyrics coat the pages, shaping the connection between the main characters, and shifting things inside me. So butterflying memorable, this one will stay with me for a long time. Like forever.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I absolutely adored this book! I was not quite expecting it to be this good. The plot on paper sounds really weird. A cyborg mechanic. Moon people. Almost Psychic Moon People, at that. A plague. And upon all that, a Cinderella retelling.<br /><br />Meyer did an amazing job retelling the classic fairytale. The characters all had depth. I never wanted to put down this book. At the end of each chapter, Meyer makes you want to read the next chapter immediately.<br /><br />My only gripe with this novel was that I figured out what Cinder was within the first 100 pages.
B00846REIS|5.0|Watch out Fifty Shades. This one might be better. Only the first book in the series, so too soon to tell. Similar characters, same plot, but Day's writing style is far cleaner than the lip-biting-Oh-Jeez that frustrated me in Fifty Shades. The female protagonist is multi-layered and possibly more tortured than her male counterpart. They make a poisonous pair of twisty dark character arcs. I sympathize with them. I want to unearth their secrets. And I'll continue to follow them despite all the sludge I get on my shoes.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I enjoyed Delirium. It was one in a long string of dystopia novels, but I enjoyed it. This novel blew Delirium away. I feel like this second in a trilogy was very similar to Crossed from the Matched trilogy. The first novel establishes the world and begins to go against the grain. The second novel is outside the society, living amongst the outsiders.<br /><br />I really enjoy when an author takes liberty in the perspective or timeline of a novel. The then and now method of revealing the story was done in a very interesting way.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It's YA (characters are college kids), but doesn't withhold the sex, drinking and fighting (kind of Fight Club-ish). The characters propelled me through their ballad of love and hate, and the plot was all over the place surprising and dramatic. And, whew! that boy. Warring between wanting to kiss him and castrate him, I went through the full range of emotions from shocked to sick to my stomach upset to grinning like a fool. Few books that can do this on a satisfying level.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I could not get past 3 chapters of this book. It is poorly written, not very creative or imaginative, and I've seen more \\"erotica\\" on sesame street. I cannot believe this is a bestseller! I think this lady must've done something incredibly wonderful in life, and as such must've been blessed with God's favor, because there is no way, outside of the supernatural, that can explain why an erotica book that seems like it was written by a virginal teenager (with no friends, who watches MTV to get off) did so well. The success of this book is unexplainable! The only thing erotic (or juicy)about this book is the success it has achieved. I actually feel sorry for real authors who toil away writing great books and never achieve success. This book is like Kim Kardashian in that it will leave you wondering \\"what is it famous for?\\" and \\"how come it's famous and not a book with actual talent (i.e. plot, good writing, good...anything?)\\"<br /><br />Wow, the favor of God!

B001I3YV7Q|4.0|\\"Fleetwood Mac: Greatest Hits Live\\" is an import album from Europe. It is a collection of live recording that were made during a series of concerts in Boston at the Boston Tea Party over a course of three nights back in February 1970. These recordings can also be found in the \\"Live In Boston Vols. 1, 2 and 3\\" series and in \\"The Vintage Years Live\\" (you can read my review for that album here on Amazon). This is the original Fleetwood Mac line-up of Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, Danny Kirwan, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood. This is certainly a rare look back at the very beginning of what would become one of the most influential rock groups of all times. Most people are more aware of Fleetwood Mac of the last 35+ years then way back when they were the top British blues bands in the world. This album is perfect for those who only know of FM of the last three decades. It will prove a great introduction to those who only know the Mac with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham in the line-up. Just about all of the early hits for the group are here including \\"Oh Well\\", \\"Black Magic Woman\\" (yes \\"Black Magic Woman\\" is in fact a Fleetwood Mac song), \\"Only You\\" and \\"The Green Manalishi\\". For those fans of the early Fleetwood Mac this album will certainly bring back memories of how the group use to be. I would recommend though if you are looking for a live album of the early Fleetwood Mac to get \\"Vintage Years Live\\". Just about all of the songs on \\"Greatest Hits Live\\" are on that album plus with \\"Vintage Years\\" you get a great 25 minute version of \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" that you don't get on \\"Greatest Hits Live\\". Still you can't go wrong getting this album. In the end you are still getting some of the best blues music being played by one of the best groups that has ever existed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was more than I expected. The story shows how two individuals learn to begin to take chances on love and trust. They begin to build the foundations of communication that so many relationships lack.<br />Wonderful love story about trust and overcoming issues.<br />And the BDSM scenes are awesome as well.
B0055S348W|5.0|I also got this app with a discount but it works great. I love the convenience of being able to print papers from my phone or tablet.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|This film contained both good and bad elements. The story, such as it was, was bad. But the acting and the characterizations around the bad story were often well done. When the film was successful, it was successful in spite of itself.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, a bunch of one-dimensional villians organize a conspiracy of breathtaking nonsense. None of their motivations make any sense at all. None of their plans really seem to have much purpose either. For the most part, the plans simply exist to create a contrived situation where the forces outside the city that would intervene in such a situation cannot intervene. Nolan's three films have all had the problem that most of the leading antagonists are insane nihlists. This one is no exception. Given the material, I give films like this a degree of latitude in terms of story. But the main plot in this film just crossed way over the line.<br /><br />But on the other side of the coin, we are presented with an excellent characterization of a man in a state of mental, spiritual and physical decline. A fighter who is past his prime and has to start solving problems in other ways. He has to recognize his own limits. He has to move on. Everyone mostly tells him this but he doesn't listen. We get the literal fall of the man and then his reconstruction. All mostly well done with the exception of having him come back physically brawling toward the end as if nothing had changed. In my opinion, he needed to evolve to a point where he was outsmarting people rather than trading stand-up punches with them but it never happened. But still all-in-all good drama within the otherwise ordinary action film.<br /><br />I liked the twists in the story. I'm not going to spoil them, but they did a good job with things often not being what they seemed.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway turned in an excellent performance as well. It was another character along the lines of reaching a dead end (in this case a criminal career) and having to change but resisting it. Her character was played smart (mostly) with understandable motivations.<br /><br />Gary Oldman (as usual) also put in a good performance. He played a sympathetic fanatic which isn't easy. And bringing back Cillian Murphy as the \\"judge\\" was a nice touch though they didn't really seem to point it out to the audience.<br /><br />Nolan also deserves credit for carrying his three films on the character to a satisfactory and I hope final conclusion. Anything beyond this film is going to require a substantially different approach.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Godfather Trilogy is the perfect gift for any fan of mafia gendre.  The films ( 1 & 2)are just perfect, storyline, cast & cinematography.  I am always amazed that each time I have viewed these films, I always glean something new.  As 'Michael', Al Pacino is a marvel. From the first time we meet Michael to the final scene, Al evolves from a 'nice' guy to 'evil.'  Yet, I am compelled to watch these films.  Just the BEST.  Film 3, to me, was miscast, and just not as fine a film as the other 2.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  I felt each and every chapter held a new twist that I was not expecting.  It was hard to decide which character to believe in and how you wanted it to turn out.

0345803507|2.0|I was knee deep in the first two books and I really thought that after he submitted to her in Bk 2 that things would turn around.  The book was titled Freed; such an inappropriate and misleading title.  Actually the opposite happens.  He is more justified in his over the top controlling ways because she stays with him.  When his ex shows up at her job just to see him and he then becomes furious with Ana after she has to piece together that he is still financially supporting his ex and they just fix everything by having sex. I almost threw the book.  I literally quit reading it several times.  When he says he wants to beat the suit out of her because he is angry I was thoroughly disturbed and disgusted. What's worse was her response which was \\"I know \\".  How maddening.  I hope everyone who reads this can see that all of his behavior is typical of an abuser.  The need to control, keeping her away from certain people,  and his verbal assaults. If I could glimpse into their future, I'm sure he would be beating her when she doesn't do what he wants.  The cherry on top was that he whipped her while she was pregnant.  WTF.  She need Dr. Flynn too.  Thanks for the let down.  Hopefully if this indeed becomes a movie, they will change these aspects.
0345803485|1.0|You have to read this to believe how bad it is.  I would give this a zero if I could.  The best use I got from this book was banging myself in the head with it, wondering \\"why? Why? Why?\\".<br /><br />Every other 1 star review on here pretty much sums it up.  I wish we could petition the publishing house to have the author pay us back for wasting our time and money on this garbage!  Where was the editor on this book, anyways?  Did someone mistakenly put it in her \\"out\\" box and it went straight to print?

So I googled the synopsis because I wasn't going to waste my time reading something this poor to get the plot. Turns out there isn't one, just a controlling guy with mommy issues and a naive school girl. Turns out, I enjoyed reading these one star reviews more than the book. Keep them coming!

1439152799|5.0|It's no secret that I have been reading The Distant Hours for a month.  The slowness was definitely contributed to the novel been nearly 600 pages, or a brick as I liked to refer to it.  It was formidable, intimidating.  I would read and not feel like I was putting a dent in it.  It was discouraging.  I think I would have given up on it weeks ago had it not been for the List Swap Challenge Julie and I are participating in.  I'm glad I didn't give up on it because this has been one of the best reads of the year for me.<br /><br />This novel incorporates many of my favorite reading loves.  I love novels about sisters, I love romance, I love heartbreak, I love novels set in the 40s.  I love reading about women and how they interact with each other.  I love the secrets, the vulnerability in revealing truths.  The Distant Hours is all those things and more.<br /><br />Ms. Morton's writing style is poetry.  The mere size of the novel is testament that she did not leave any stones unturned.  This novel was well researched, thought-out.  She bounced back and forth between 1941 and 1992 with ease.  I was never confused or confounded.<br /><br />She writes such strong, beautiful women.  Each of the sisters, as well as Edie, Meredith, Lucy, and Rita, were multidimensional characters.  I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know each one.  One of the stunning truths of this novel is that although each woman had strength of her own, they were more or less control by one man and his secrets, Raymond Blythe.  He was the catalyst The Distant Hours.<br /><br />Shroud in mystery, Ms. Morton's gift is revealing these in an unexpected way.  Just like Edie, I would begin to think one thing, convinced I had it figured out and then Wham! - Here comes the truth and it would leave my head spinning and feeling awed, impressed how easily I was fooled and how the truth was there all along.<br /><br />This novel was such a pleasure to read.  It reminds me of the kind of novel you curl up to on a cold, rainy or snowy night.  It's comfortable, it makes you think, it keeps you guessing.  Maybe it's the castle setting, maybe it's the relationship between the women.  Maybe it's the women individually.  There is just something so wonderful about this novel that each minute spend reading it is like getting to know a new friend.<br /><br />And just how it was highly recommended to me, I highly recommend it to you.rainy or snowy night.

B000UJCALI|5.0|If you dont like this movie, you got a short attention span.  This has been the standard for any horror movie since, especially psychological and supernatural thrillers.  The second disc has interesting on location home movies from the filming with behind the scenes like action with the cast, including Scatman Crothers, Shirley Duvall and of course Jack Nicholson. Stanley Kubrick as well.<br />If you love to be scared and love movies you must see this in your lifetime. dont wait till.... your.. DEAD!!!!!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Order this book to see why it was being ban in some libraries. I am against ban books and even though I think this is for adults I did not think it needed to be band. I enjoyed the story, even if the sadistic scenes had been left out it was a good story. I would like to read book 2 and 3. I am 78 years old so as you may guess this type of book would have never even been written in my time. It is up tp parents to police there childrens reading. Oh, I can't understand how this book is making a baby boom. I think those guys better check there facts.

B004G6009K|4.0|I have already seen this movie in full HD and really enjoyed it so, I knew I would like it more in 3D. The animation and depth of scenes is really cool although some scenes appeared a bit dark...a downfall I have noticed in other 3D movies. Also, not a lot of really \\"explosive\\" pop-out scenes. Still, a very enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />The story is an old one based on Rapunzel with a twist having her hair capable (magically) of \\"renewing\\" the old/injured. Hence, the evil witch using Rapunzel's hair to stay young and holding her prisoner in a very high tower. Rapunzel, since infancy, believes the witch is her mother protecting her from the dangers of the outside world. Rapunzel, with the help of Flynn (the handsome rogue) decides she needs to experience the outside world and leaves the tower. The emotions erupt...guilt to excitement and then the real story begins. Yes, Rapunzel is exposed to the dangers of the outside world and encounters many \\"unsavory\\" characters...maybe not suited for the skittish kid. Still, this is only a make-believe movie.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie with a good, new, storyline. If you like this movie, you will probably also like [[ASIN:B0049GYXCC Enchanted [Blu-ray + DVD]]]. Or, if animation is not your thing, Enchanted is a very good alternative.

1609611543|2.0|This book came highly recommended from a friend who has been wheat free for over a year.  Not only is my friend 40 pounds lighter but he has never felt better.  As I began to read Wheat Belly, I was initially quite impressed (having a health care background) and decided to implement a trial wheat free diet for myself.  First off, I am not diabetic, nor am I overweight.  I'm 46, female and definitely could look a lot better if I lost about 10 pounds.  Thus, I was highly intrigued by the 'visceral fat be gone' comments as well as a faint hope that my itchy, irritated scalp would somehow get better.  As some of the other reviewers wrote, this author claims that by eliminating wheat, a whole host of symptoms and conditions will disappear.<br /><br />Well, after 26 days of no wheat, I not only gained an additional 6 pounds but I actually began having low back pain, headaches and my scalp was worse than ever.  No joke on this.  I would like to think that the extra fat that was entering my system from all of the nuts and eggs I was feasting on had something to do with it, however, this would defy some of the theory presented in this book - so I'm not entirely sure what was happening.  I also didn't overload on 'other' carbs or gluten free products (a common problem that the author outlines in his book).  Needless to say, I was feeling pretty bad after 26 days.<br /><br />By the end of the book, the recommended diet choices (as other reviewers have noted) were sparse at best - particularly after eliminating all other carbs - i.e., legumes.  Even quinoa had to be consumed in extremely limited quantities.  Really, you are left with fish, chicken, vegetables, nuts and eggs.  If you also zone in on some of the percentage changes from some of the studies quoted, they are not that much different and the author doesn't elaborate on whether they were statistically significant changes.<br /><br />I can only surmise that my genetic make-up is not meant to be carb-free, wheat-free, glucose-free - whatever you want to call it.  It probably also explains why my 51 year old sister can still consume 2 full plates of pasta on a regular basis and maintain her size 0 figure.  It would be interesting to find studies completed on folks who consume large amounts of wheat/glucose and seem to be very healthy.  We all know these people - the ones we say 'oh, they just have a high metabolism'.<br /><br />As evidenced by the reviews, this diet has obviously done wonders for some people which I think is great.  However, I do wonder if some of the people who have done so well with elimination of wheat are the very same people who consume LARGE proportions (in general) in the form of cookies, muffins, processed foods (crackers), cakes etc.  Eliminating these from your diet alone will have a huge effect.  My suggestion is read 'for interest'...but know your own body and what works for you.  As it stands, I'm sticking with my purchases of freshly baked whole grain (warm!) bread from my local store, I have never felt better and my next adventure might be the Bread Diet - lol!

B001AVCFK6|1.0|I love the Star Trek franchise so much I want to see a new Star Trek series! A lot of fan hopes are riding on this film! To drive this point home - I actually stopped watching television programing completely once Enterprise (the last Star Trek series) went off the air about 7+ years ago! And, I have literally watched every TV episode (and film) of every Star Trek series, in real time, since its inception in 1966! I also collect rare vintage Star Trek memorabilia, have heard Leonard Nimoy, and many others involved with Star Trek, speak at various Science Fiction Conventions from the early 1970's to the present, and I subscribed to a Star Trek fanzine, \\"Trexperts,\\" edited by a one dedicated Star Trek fan, which is still mailed all over the world! Needless to say, the Star Trek universe has had a huge impact on my life!<br /><br />I sincerely hope someone from Hollywood reads this review! In the long run (and that's what Star Trek is all about) you're not going to win new fans by dumbing-down Star Trek into a comic book story solely to satisfy the fickle teen market! I realize a lot of the previous 11 Star Trek movies have been box office flops (and for good reason!) because IT'S ABOUT THE STORY, STUPID! Sure the special-effects-eye-candy is spectacular, the cinematography does not disappoint and the design of the sets are absolutely amazing! The acting ranged from excellent (the New Captain Kirk & Leonard McCoy) to sufficient (the new and original Mr. Spock). And, all the supporting cast certainly held their own! But the story was so unimaginative and preposterous, it came across as nothing more than boring cardboard drivel.<br /><br />It kind of boggles the mind! There are absolutely an endless number of Science Fiction themes that run through all the various Star Trek episodes. What more could you want? You have about 26 YEARS worth of episode ideas to choose from! Then there are plenty of ideas Star Trek has not explored which is summarized in a single 900+ pages book covering most Science Fiction ever written in any language in the world: [[ASIN:1591581710 Anatomy of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction]]. It doesn't take a genius to do the research to come up with new and wonderful ideas! But no! The Spineless Chickens at Paramount had to make a film with as much delight and imagination as the last Star Trek movie dud! What an incredible insult to all the Star Trek fans that have spent their time and money supporting Star Trek over the years by watching only God knows how many vapid TV commercials or spending their money on film tickets, videos, DVD sets, books & fan magazines, convention tickets and Star Trek memorabilia!<br /><br />Ironically, at the same Star Trek was playing in the theaters, I went to see a brilliant science fiction animated film, [[ASIN:B002FVPFU2 Battle for Terra [Blu-ray]]]. It's hard to believe, but it was showing on a mere single screen in a metropolitan area with about 1.5 million people! Despite the magnificent animation, storyline, and acting - staring both Danny Glover and James Garner (of all people!), it was a miserable flop at the box office. Why? Because the story was both too imaginative and gutsy! Something the Star Trek franchise once was like - a long, long time ago!

It's hard to believe, but it was showing on a mere single screen in a metropolitan area with about 1.5 million people! Despite the magnificent animation, storyline, and acting - staring both Danny Glover and James Garner (of all people!), it was a miserable flop at the box office. Why? Because the story was both too imaginative and gutsy! Something the Star Trek franchise once was like - a long, long time ago! I can only pray that in the future Hollywood's goal of relentlessly maximizing profits does not win out over substance and delight!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This show is amazing. The acting is incredible and the story gets better and better.  Watched all 4 seasons in 2 weeks:)
1455844195|5.0|I loved this book. Why? It is funny and fun, with a likeable main character and parents (and other adults) who are smart and caring even as they disagree.  It also shows students and adults who don't do the right thing (and I saw myself in some of those mistakes.)BORING PART FOR ADULTS: I loved that this book holds a mirror up to some middle school behavior in a way I think readers will really understand.  That it IS brave to be the one to befriend the new kid, especially if the new kid isn't popular.  That is it IS hard to be the one who stands strong for what is right.  So many books with those themes are preachy and obvious -- \\"Read this, it will be good for you.\\"  Young readers see through that (adult readers too!) This book doesn't feel that way.<br /><br />Minor quibble: I wish there were a more realistic picture of Auggie and his deformity, instead of just written descriptions. I had trouble picturing what Auggie really looked like. I feel like it couldn't be as off-putting as he says, but maybe it was.<br /><br />About me: I'm a middle school/high school librarian<br />How I got this book: I purchased it
B000AS4L16|4.0|I'm hoping those who have seen this on DVD can be of some help..<br />I borrowed the 4 VHS version from my library. At times I was fascinated- at the time & effort put into making this amazing film. Actually, it's more than a film- it's more like a testament, a time capsule, if you will.<br />At other times I was tearing at the witnesses telling what happened.<br />The most frustrating thing I found (and THIS is where I could use your advice & help) was, on the VHS edition, there's white English subtitles. Well, many scenes show show, or light backgrounds, making it IMPOSSIBLE to read them, and some very important information is TOTALLY lost! I'm a fan of hearing the original language something is filmed in, not having it dubbed (something is ALWAYS lost), so if anyone who has seen, or owns this on DVD- can you please let me know if the subtitles have been improved?<br />Thank you...
B002AF4Y96|1.0|I got so dizzy ten minutes into watching this version, I had to shut it off.  I have seen this movie twice in the theatre and many times on laser disc and DVD.  It never looked like this.  I traded in my much better DVD version for a $5.00 coupon at Best Buy.  There is something wrong with this version and the shaking.  I don't know how the error was made and don't trust it's a single issue.  It has to be the way it was processed.  This is the most messed up transfer I've seen to date. If Oliver Stone ever agreed to messing up his own film, he has well outdone what Steven Spielberg did with the 2002 version of E.T.  Now after returning it for a refund I have no version of NBK, leaving my Oliver Stone collection incomplete.  I wonder if they will ever correct this in later editions.  At least they have it on Netflix and is the better original version!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|If you followed the Star Trek series and the Next Generation series you will love this movie.  I consider it one of the best movies I've ever seen.  They combined the old and new perfectly.

B0086700CM|5.0|This is just one of those awesome games that is right up there with angry birds and cut the rope. It is lots of fun, simple, addicting, and, amazingly, free!<br /><br />Another cool feature is the ability to purchase certain power-ups and even new characters with the coins you collect as you run, so its luckily not one of those games where you have to make a bunch of in app purchases to get anything or do anything.<br /><br />I have had this game for a while and can tell you it is definetly worththe space on your device to install. Get this game!
0345803485|3.0|Anastasia Steele fills in for her roommate to do an interview with a local CEO (Christian Grey) for the college newspaper. She's pleasantly surprised to find out he's young, good looking, powerful (over 40,000 employees), wealthy, interesting, and quite controlling. After Anastasia finished her questions, Mr. Grey unexpectedly cancels his next appointment and begins asking her questions. One thing leads to another, and he's followed Anastasia to her job at a local hardware store, then rescues her from a drunken evening at a local bar, and helicopters Ana to his Seattle penthouse. There Christian confronts her with a nondisclosure agreement, his rules and 'incentives package' and they negotiate the details of a 'what we will and won't do.' They then enter an area resembling a scene from the 16th century Spanish Inquisition - dominated by a large bed in the center.<br /><br />Twenty-four hours later Anastasia is no longer a virgin (X3), and has both given and received oral sex as well. Just then his mother arrives.<br /><br />The 'good news' is that the interest in this book (eg. 206 copies at the Phoenix Library, over 20 million copies sold) has boosted the economy (directly through sales of the book, indirectly through sales of items referenced in the book) and probably millions of couples' sex lives. The 'bad news' is that its just 'too much' - too much BDSM sex, Christian Grey is too much of a 'God' (handsome, billionaire that never works, pilot, Renaissance Man, etc.), and Anastasia becomes too much of a 'teenage airhead' after awhile.

B007X15GRQ|2.0|Don't get sucked in by the trailer. This movie  never entered the realm of possibility, which I can live with, but the movie did nothing to generate any interest in the outcome for the characters.

B0043M4TYY|2.0|The writing is good and the overall organization of information of the book is good, but everything was lost in translation to a kindle edition. *Almost none* of the hyperlinks work correctly, taking you to random pages with no way to get back. Additionally the maps are so low-resolution they can't be read, and they are cut into bizarre sections with the legends being found on different pages. Skip the e version and get the book. I'd like my money back.
0312945973|5.0|I just finished re-reading River God by Wilbur Smith. I love this book, and am so fascinated by novels set in ancient Egypt. It made me laugh, cry, and captivated me utterly. There's a tortured love story, lots of heroism and battle, intrigue and conflict, and an amazing narrator, Taita the slave. He is extremely narcissistic and I'm sure is exaggerating his abilities, but I do think he is a genius at many, many things.<br /><br />Stephen King says that Wilbur Smith is the best historical novelist, and I completely agree. I love how books help me escape, especially the truly epic ones like River God.<br /><br />I'm now going to reread the sequel, Warlock, which is not as good, but still pretty awesome.<br /><br />Paul Genesse<br />Author of the Iron Dragon Series

B001974DG0|5.0|I would have never thought the words \\"fiddle broke\\" could break my heart and make me cry like a baby until this book. You must read this one and when you get to the point I am referring to, come back and let me know how you reacted. Koontz makes his characters come alive, you would think you knew them in real life. And the dog  (fuzzy butt...lol) is one that I will never be able to forget. For some reason he (or his goodness) is in my heart now and that is actually a good thing. I don't recommend books too often but I recommend this one with every fiber of my being.
B008BM9L72|1.0|This is a very poorly written book - very repetitive and with very little substance.<br /><br />Did not enjoy the books at all and would not recommend to any reader.<br /><br />The hype is the only thing selling this book.
0345803485|1.0|I bought the trilogy because it was on the best seller's list and wanted a good summer read for vacation.  I'm no prude by any means but this is pure trash.  The writing is ghastly like something a tween would come up with if they knew ugly words.  I literally felt like if I read \\"my inner goddess\\" one more time I was going to become ill.  This is how supposedly educated, smart, rich, classy people talk?  I'll stay right in the less educated middle class then.  Shallow, silly, immature and REPETITIVE.  A total waste of time and money.

It is sort of like the 80's Navy Seals with Charlie Sheen. If they are going to make movies this poor then they should make a fictional Rate (job) in the military so not to disrespect them real Heros and Warriors.

B008K8U13K|3.0|I had originally purchased this game on the playstation network. I liked this game very much, the graphics are excellent and gameplay is pretty intense. I must concede I like it most of all because it goes back to the way sonic game's used to be. So many of the modern day sonic offerings have gone astray from the original concept. I didn't like any of the sonic 3D games, guess I prefer the old style side scrolling games.
0307730697|5.0|I first heard about this book from my dad. He had heard an interview about it on the radio and said he wanted to read it. So when I had the opportunity to read Fearless I was excited.<br />I liked how the story was so much more than just about a Navy SEAL and his work in the military. It was a story about an addict overcoming his fear, a man who loved God and his family and friends, a man who was fearless and courageous. Right from the beginning of the book I found myself rooting for Adam Brown to overcome his addiction.<br />Adam Brown was a true hero. He was always there for his family, friends, and teammates. He was never willing to give up, even after multiple injuries. He was completely dedicated to his country and God. I really appreciate people like Adam and his wife Kelley who are willing to sacrifice so much for everyone. By the end of the book I was crying. Kelley and their two children Savannah and Nathan were so precious. You could really tell that they had God in their lives.<br />This ended up being a book that I really enjoyed. I think that Eric Blehm did a wonderful job telling Adam's story. I would recommend this book to everyone because I think that so many people would be touched and learn from this story.<br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this honest review.
B00000JPH6|2.0|Having been impressed by Labrynth, I decided to watch one of Henson's other less-watched films; the Dark Crystal, knowing almost nothing about it, except that it was a fantasy film about characters in a world full of strange creatures.  It sounded, from this alone, like something I would like.  You see, I'm a big lover of fantasy stories of all types.<br /><br />The premise of this movie is that in another world, there is a crystal, which seems to influence the wellbeing of the planet and its people.  The crystal cracked, and this led, apparently, to an evil race, named the skeksis, seizing power over it.  They use it, along with their scouts, the crystal bats, and their shock troops; the insectoid Garthim, to enforce a rein of terror over all the less powerful races.  Meanwhile, a race of mystics have been raising a young gelfling (like an elf with only eight fingers and a very low nose,) for his destiny of fulfilling a prophecy; recovering the lost shard of the crystal and returning it to where it belongs, thus robbing the skeksis of their power.  The Gelfling's name is Jen.  In his quest to restore the crystal to its true form, Jen meets up with a female Gelfling named Kira, and her furball Fizzgig, all of them having lost loved ones to the skeksis, and eager to put an end to their reign.<br /><br />Done right, this could be a charming story about grief, redemption and love.  However, this movie is not done right.  For one thing, neither of the two main characters seems to have much of any personality to them.  They exist to assist in the story, and their backgrounds consist of a series of loose associations and talents.  They're both about as bland as can be, and not much of anything is ever learned about them.  This is the first big problem I had with the film.  It gets caught up in its alien worldbuilding and odd visuals, and forgets that it's supposed to be telling a story here.<br /><br />The second big problem with this movie, and for me, the most serious, is that the whole thing, from start to finish, is essentially one long piece of new age propaganda.  I've seen signs of this is Henson's work before, but never to this degree.  The prominence of the crystal, the sorcery of the mystics, the dream-sharing between the Gelflings, the poor understanding of the relationship between body and soul demonstrated by the movie's ending (in which people essentially merge into one another,) the clear failure to grasp what an \\"essence\\" is, and finally, the bunk new age ideology spouted by the shimmering aliens at the end about how \\"we are all one.\\"  This type of thing alone is enough to turn me off to the film.<br /><br />There's also a not-very-forgivable scene of the two gelflings sleeping together in the woods.  Granted, they are essentially puppets, but the whole movie takes itself so seriously, that I have no doubt what this was meant to convey.<br /><br />If it seems like I'm complaining a lot about this film considering the grade I gave it, this is only because I really did appreciate some of the worldbuilding, scenery and creative creatures that Henson and Company came up with for this flick.  They're very beautiful, visually-impressive, and they capture the imagination, but it's not worth putting up with the problems this film has.is that the whole thing, from start to finish, is essentially one long piece of new age propaganda.

B003VPWX6K|5.0|I had long heard about the book and seen the movie ages ago, and having become slightly obsessed with Downton Abbey, I wanted to revisit the movie. But first, the book. I was very surprised by the book. It was thoughtful, beautiful and it took its time developing the story, such as it is. I found myself surprisingly moved, which was all the more startling because there is not really a tear-jerking scene in the book. But because you get to know the lead character so well, and the restraint of emotion that he shows not only to others, but also to himself, the emotions of the reader become palpable. While it is of average length, it reads very quickly and feels much shorter than it is. But the journey of the book, much like the journey of the lead character, is well worth taking.

B005USZYDU|4.0|It's nice to read an intelligent start to a new series, and I look forward to reading the next two. I have to admit I am not a huge John Grisham fan, I always found his adult fiction a bit meandering and cluttered with too much information and a massive roster of (mostly unnecessary) characters. This cuts right to the action, and the author keeps the action moving while finding time to develop some lighter sub-plots. Theo is a smart, savvy, lawyer (or judge) in the making and takes the lead with his `client' while getting just enough - but not too much - support from his parents and uncle.  Highly recommended.

B007ZZKWHY|3.0|You'd probably enjoy this film more if you try to not think of it as a comedy. It is somewhat of a yawner but the concept was intriguing, nevertheless.  It helps me to enjoy this movie more, if I just think of it as a silly little story that could have been told in about 25 minutes, but they stretched it out longer than it had to be to be able to call it a movie at all.<br /><br />You can definitely see that it was put together with a very limited budget.  Maybe it is counting on it's \\"limited theatrical release availability\\" to sell it as a cult film on Blu-ray or DVD.  I paid far more than what this movie is worth, but I can see already that some people are asking about it, probably because their film trailer has gotten some tangible play on YouTube.  I mean, that was where it whet some of my interest.<br /><br />Maybe the limitation of the availability of this film to a larger American audience is because it seems to be another jab at enhancing the ridicule of the possibility that Sarah Palin could actually be elected as our President.  Which, I have no doubt, could be possible by the cruel fate of selective default. If all we continue to choose from for the upcoming election, is all those greedy, self-serving, morally decadent, slimeballs running for office, we'd eventually end up voting in the lesser of all the evils or idiots on the ballot. So, we never win. Nothing ever changes for the better. Again, I think I'd rather see Sarah Palin in Penthouse, not the White House! America continues its downward spiral.<br /><br />I think the hype is way too high with this film.  But, we'll see.
0345535421|4.0|If you loved book one (A Game of Thrones), then you will love this one as well, just as I (and thousands of other readers) did. There are many reasons for that, and most have already been mentioned by the many previous reviewers over the past twelve years or so.<br /><br />One is that this is escapism for adults at its best. Its feels and sound \\"real\\" and no character is entirely \\"black\\" or \\"white\\". There certainly are lots of \\"goodies\\" and \\"baddies\\" and these are rather easy to distinguish. However, some (or even most) of the \\"baddies\\" can \\"feel\\" almost sympathetic, at times, or, at least, Martin depicts them and shows their feelings in ways that make them so and allow readers to empathize with them, regardless of how ruthless they may be. A typical example is Tyrion Lannister, the Imp, who happens to be one of my favorites, but even his dashing and traitorous elder brother Jaime can elicit sympathy, at times.<br /><br />A second point is, of course, that the author pulls no punches in trying (very successfully) in making the story sound and feel real, with all the sex and violence that you may wish for, but also much more than that. Knights are warriors, fighters and killers, not paragons of virtue and nobility. Lords - and not only mercenaries - change sides, according to their interests and attack those who were naïve enough to believe they were friends. Civil war across the whole fictitious continent of Westeros (which has vaguely the shape of Great Britain but something like ten times its size) brings out the worst in many. At times, I felt I was reading something on the War of the Roses and this story is partly inspired by the historical civil war, except that it is even more complex, with five or six sides in the field.<br /><br />A third point is that we get introduced to a number of \\"new\\" characters. In some cases, such as that of Stannis Barratheon, we have heard of them but not seen them in action. In a few other cases, there are entirely new (although I will not mention these to avoid spoilers). In others, they take on a life of their own (such as Theon). A fourth point, already made by other reviewers, is the presence of credible and key female characters, including at least two or three among the warriors, alongside the queens and ladies.<br />The story telling is much the same as in the first book. Martin jumps from one lead character to another to tell us what is happening in various parts of the continent from the Wall (with Jon Snow, bastard son of the recently beheaded Lord Stark) to the East, with Danaerys, the last of her line, and her dragons.<br /><br />There are, however, a few things that made this book slightly less attractive - although just as griping - than book one, at least for me. Despite being over 870 pages, nothing much seems to happen to some of the characters (Danaerys, in particular). I did get the -somewhat subjective - impression that the pace had slowed down. I was also surprised not to find ANY chapters on Robb Stark. You keep hearing about his campaigns and victories but, unlike in the previous volume, all you hear about is second hand information. To be fair, however, this is largely because Martin seems to have chosen to shift the core of the story in this volume to other fronts on which the wars are being fought, in particular the North and King's Landing, and the fighting and battle scenes are just as good as in the previous book. Finally, the author also introduces us to new people and civilizations. For instance, those of the Iron Islands seem to be inspired by the Scandinavian Vikings who settled in the Hebrides.<br /><br />All in all, I loved this book and just could not drop it, just like volume one. However, I found it, of course, less original than the first volume. I also found it a bit on the long side and it would be highly preferable to read the volumes in sequence. For me, this is a strong four star book, but it does not quite deserve five stars.will not mention these to avoid spoilers). In others, they take on a life of their own (such as Theon).

Wes Anderson is one of my favorite directors, the cast is phenomenal, and the movie flies by. Great plot, hilarious, touching, and beautiful. I'll be re-watching this movie for years to come.

B005LAIHYU|5.0|Fantastic, fun movie. Don't take it too seriously, and don't expect this to be exactly like the book of the same name. I enjoyed this movie, the acting was fantastic, the monsters terrifying and truly villains (these are not your romantic teeny-bopper vampires). Unlike the book, the movie is more action focused and more of an ensemble cast which includes the villain Adam (played by Rufus Sewell who does a brilliant job at being charismatic and frightening). The movie is campy, more actions and stunts than the drama the novel had, but don't let that prevent you from enjoying the movie for what it is.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Throughout the whole hunger games trilogy, Peeta always brough out the best in Katniss. Whether she was extremely mad, sad, or being her normal self. PEETA always seemed to know the right thing to say and when to say it! I think it was well played by Ms. Collins to take Peeta mostly out of Katniss's life in Mockingjay because it Katniss realize how much she really needed Peeta, plus it made you wanna keep reading to see what would happen to Peeta! I absolutely adored the ending when Peeta asked if she loved, but then after that Katniss reminded  me of my grandma always thinking the, but I don't blame her with all she's been through! It made me sad that left me wanting, but Iguess it's the author's job to keep you intrigued!
B004ZN9Q3K|4.0|Perhaps \\"Meddle\\" should have been called \\"Almost\\" instead. Although Pink Floyd would record one more album before tackling \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" (the film soundtrack \\"Obscured by Clouds\\"), \\"Meddle\\" is the only pre-\\"Dark Side\\" album that really sounds of a piece with that record and the band's later works.<br /><br />Yes, this disc did include a (vinyl) sidelong work, just like the \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" album did. But \\"Echoes\\" is much more focused and structured -- a song that clearly was WRITTEN and not just slapped together. From the opening, pinging, distorted piano note to the howling noise at the end, it's no less than hypnotic. The lyrics do sound a bit dated these days, but they're still the best lyrics the post-Syd Barrett band had written up to that time.<br /><br />The other side of the album featured songs of much more conventional length. The opener was the ferocious \\"One of these Days,\\" featuring not one but two aggressive bass guitars (one with newer strings that sounded growlier, the other with old strings that sounds more thuddy/boomy). \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" was a great, evocative, atmospheric ballad. \\"Fearless\\" is one of my favorite Floyd tracks -- it's driven mostly by acoustic guitars, and the rather pugnacious lyrics definitely give the song and edgy quality. But it's the soccer fans near the end, chanting \\"You'll Never Walk Alone,\\" that push the track from menacing to downright eerie. The side concludes with some decidedly lightweight pop in the form of \\"St. Tropez\\" and what may be the dumbest song in the PF canon, \\"Seamus,\\" which features a dog or two howling along with the music.<br /><br />Of all the Floyd albums between \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" and \\"Dark Side,\\" \\"Meddle\\" is the most tuneful, most listenable, most downright enjoyable. Recommended.
B00843TZJ2|2.0|If you have to own absolutely everything CS&N puts out, go ahead and buy this. It's relatively harmless. But as we've sorely learned, music should never be harmless. This is music that takes no risks, and shows little inspiration except for Stills' brief exploration into \\"Within You, Without You\\" on the final cut, \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.\\" (Other than that, I believe Judy Collins would like them to stop singing the song.)<br />There is very little new here. The boys sound like they're just going through the motions as if they have to fulfill a contract. And sometimes, the motions are quite sloppy. It's interesting to hear \\"Carry On,\\" a song that was a disaster on \\"Four-Way Street.\\" They still can't perform it live 40 years later and come anywhere near the studio version.<br />I thought the acoustic songs would be the saving grace but that is not to be. Why they decided to slur \\"Girl from the North Country\\" is beyond comprehension. Musically, they're way past their prime. Their trademark harmonies no longer bring chills, just cringes. The back-up band provides the best moments.<br />Like everyone else here, I agree that Stills should sing solo. His voice has evolved into a bluesy growl that cannot be sweetened by his partners. In addition, if he is such a guitar legend as many claim, where's the solos? His playing has the same old stiff, fuzzy buzz that it's had for 30 years. Come on Steve, you own 100 guitars. Play a different one for a change.<br />I saw C&N on the 2011 tour and thought they did it all. If you happened to see this 2012 CS&N tour, I'm sure you have fond memories but on the morning after, this package is more like a hangover than a souvenir.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great book...stayed up late into the night to read and pretty much put my life on hold to finish this baby!  Immediately after reading this I read Jamie's Providence trilogy and absolutely loved those books too. Can't wait for Travis' POV in Walking Disaster which is due out in 2013 (hopefully early 2013)!!<br /><br /><Warning Warning> Do not bring the book/kindle to work...you will not get anything done! HAHA! :-)

I read Slammed and POR in one day, I couldn't put them down!!  These books have such a creative story line and had me wanting to find a place to experience Slammed poetry in my area.  I'm anxiously awaiting Colleen's next book from Will's POV and will definitely read more from her when its available.  Check out her blog too...she's one funny lady!! :-) [...]    Love her aversion to Nickleback (in the book and her blog)...had me CRACKING up!

B004UXUX4Q|1.0|I watch a lot of films.  Like three or four a month.  In my opinion the most important part of film watching is believability.  You have to be able to immerse yourself into the film, almost becoming part of the plot yourself, and live the story with the characters, feeling the happy moments, the sad and hurt when the characters do.<br /><br />That is what Descendants lack, believability.<br /><br />The film starts with George Clooney sat at his wife's bedside whilst she is in a coma, with his voice over telling us how regretful he is of how he has lived his life and treated her up to that point and that he will get better and make up for his wrongs.  It sounded as insincere as a child saying sorry after stealing a cookie.  His blank expression on camera and monotone voice would keep most people comotose.<br /><br />There are supposed to be comedy moments throughout the film - well if you count the extremely poor direction and wooden acting becoming increasingly laughable throughout the film, then yes, it's full of comedic gems.<br /><br />The weird moment when the camera pans to the daughter finding out her Mum is not going to survive whilst she is swimming in the pool and she disappears under the water to have a cry.  Is that even possible without drowning?  I couldn't help but watch the screen in puzzlement.<br /><br />And the weird boyfriend of the daughter, what was that all about?!  An odd character, but there was a refreshing moment when the Grandad punched him, everyone watching will feel a huge feeling of satisfaction when this happens, trust me.<br /><br />George Clooney's wife was having an affair.  When his daughter told him this, he looked like he just found out he'd forgotten to feed the goldfish.  I don't know if this was not the type of acting George Clooney should be doing, or really bad direction.<br /><br />And continuity...it's not difficult surely?  If you pan to an actor in a coma and they have their mouth open, make sure in the next shot from adifferent angle it's still open.  That's got to be one of the first lessons in film making school right?<br /><br />This film does do something I never thought possible, it beat The Cube as the worst film ever.  And that's hard work.<br /><br />So if you're still hovering over the 'buy' button after reading my review, buy a copy of Ocean's Eleven as well to watch straight after this film to remind yourself that George Clooney is where he is in the film industry for a reason...and that's not for Descendants.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I enjoy Follett's storytelling combined with historical facts that gave me a different view of why the First World War occured. Nothing is black and while and I can follow his suggestion that the fault of the WW1 not only lies with Germany, but possible with the aristocrates in England and Russia as well as the French desire to recapture land taken from them in a previous war.
B0063GORYU|5.0|dis game is too good. I love it. its all I do on a daily basis besides dat loveeee. ;)
B008ASLK8A|4.0|If you liked the first movie, then you will love this one. I felt it was a great followup, and the scene between Holmes and Watson on the train was one of the best parts. You won't be disappointed if you check this movie out. I certainly wasn't!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|The concept is interesting. It's something we have all thought about at one time or another in our lives. \\"What if I could go back in time and change things?\\" The conclusion was also interesting. I wouldn't rate \\"11/22/63\\" among my favorites from King, i.e.  \\"The Green Mile\\", \\"Cujo\\", and \\"The Dead Zone\\", but it was still worth the read.
B007MAETA8|2.0|Long time John Mayer fan here.  At one point he was favorite musician.  However, this new album is really disappointing.  Only 2 songs are worthwhile in my opinion \\"Queen of California\\" and \\"Something like Olivia\\".  The rest is just boring to me.  Nothing really jumped out at me and grabbed my attention.  In fact, I find myself having to concentrate hard to keep myself listening and not daydreaming.  It's not just the shift of musical style either.  I like this low key / folky / americana kind of vibe when it's done well.  Ray Lamontagne's \\"God Willing and the Creek Don't Rise\\" comes to mind.  LOVED that album and that seems to be type of vibe John Mayer was shooting for in this release.  Unfortunately, I think he missed the mark by a mile.
B00772M1F6|5.0|\\"Signs and Signifiers\\" by J.D. McPherson is the ideal path back to the wonderful days of 1950's Rock and Roll. There is the high energy music played to perfection by McPherson's band. Mr McPherson himself almost shocks at first, sounding so much like Little Richard at times it is happily amazing. But his lyrics and feelings takes you right back home to today. The mixing of the album, for a most pleasant change today, allows McPherson's strong and enthusiastic voice to grab you and carry you away. I'm so happy I found this album and the wonders of McPherson. If you miss the good old days of real rock and roll, sung with unbridles enthusiasm and backed by a great band, you won't be disappointed in \\"Signs and Signifiers\\".
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I was captivated through to the very end.  I could not imagine how it would end but it seemed the ending was the only one possible.

B000007177|4.0|This CD was delivered ahead of it's estimated delivery date..................and in excellent condition........it is remarkable how a band like \\"Jethro Tull\\" has survived for so long even after their celebrated releases of the mid-seventies rock an roll craze that swept the country( i.e, Benefit,Aqualung,Thick as a Brick ,A Passion Play).  Well let's put it this way if u loved those albums as so many of us  do, then u will  undoubtebly love these recording taken from multiple recording sessions for these historic albums......some of my favorite,\\"Paradise Steakhouse\\",\\"The Curse\\",Commons Brawl\\",and my personal favorite from the 2 CD set \\"Broadford Bazaar\\"...if u love Tull then u won't want to miss this stuff.......don't be the last one on ur block to rush out and grap this gem.............right on right on......Great Scott
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy was an excellent, very exciting, erotic, page turning love story...... This was the best thing I've read all summer... i know ill read it again.
0553801473|1.0|Given the amount of time i put into reading the first 4 books I simply had to read this. What a massive dissapointment. Random characters that have no point to the story and many many loose endings. Martin is clearly capable of getting the reader to either love or loath a character but then decides to simply finish the plot line with a half baked excuse to stop. The book left me with a feeling of being conned and ripped off. Martin - you should have wraped this up after book three - it's clear that he sold out to HBO and thus leaves the reader feeling that he has wasted his time.<br /><br />Reading this reminded me of watching LOST - great to begin with but it tails off and has a stupid ending leaving you thinking - why did i bother??
B0058IA7FC|5.0|Leonard is one of my, and, my wifes favorite artists. There is something about vinyl that is just BETTER than CD.

B004LUS390|4.0|I love this! I really want to be an artist so this app really helps me easily sketch out ideas. I've drawn lots of \\"art\\" on this app that I love to save and add on to later!<br />It's fun and cheap too! At $2 why not? It's the same price as Drawing Pad (which I have yet to purchase since this is so awesome!)<br />The only issue I have with this app is that there is NO BLUR/BLEND, which can get a little annoying when trying to blend face lighting/shadow with the skin tone. Another thing is the setup can get a little clunky and hard to use, with everything placed a little oddly, but this just needs getting used to. Do that, and you're set!<br />Other then that, It's just about perfect! I would definately recommend this app! In fact, I already have, to some of my friends<br /><br />Get this app! It rocks!<br />used on *Kindle Fire*

B001LF347E|5.0|I love everything British and am a fantasy freak!  Camelot is one of my favorite musicals so it's no wonder that Merlin is so enjoyable.  It's so entertaining because of the great blend of comedy, drama, special effects and a wonderful cast.  I also enjoy the relationship between Arthur and Gueneviere - a bit of a twist from the musical.
B002C4YYEU|1.0|Here are bullets of why it is bad:<br />* Way too long<br />* Boring characters<br />* Horrible acting<br />* Did not adequately develop the aging backwards thing

B007L3BMGA|1.0|the female character's naive and endlessly gobsmacked sexual point of view starts to grate after the first few sex scenes ..  reads like 'Twilight discovers sex' ..  didn't hook me, guess I'm the wrong gender for it ..  illustrates how controversy and word of mouth can sell..  wont be going to the movie..  lol..
B000002J09|5.0|Excellent CD with quick delivery. About all your could ask for here. Great gift for someone you want to learn about great rock music.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read quite a bit and have always leaned heavy into the SciFi and Techno type books. After a while one starts to feel as though stories are repeating themselves. This book smashed that fear. The story in Wool is so well thought out it's amazing. It's also one of the most original stories I've read in some time. When I review books I make sure that I don't drop any spoilers so I won't go into detail. Suffice it to say that you will be kept rivited to this book from start to finish.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|the movie is fantastic. the music even better!! I would recommend this cd if you liked the movie or musical.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is awesome,do not get me wrong. but i bought the theater like it told me to, and i went to play a movie and i had to force close the app. all in all, really good app, but theater needs fixed
0345803485|5.0|I had heard how good this book was, but I have to say it was much better than I expected. I finished it in about 3 days and it would have been sooner if I didn't have to work and sleep. Excellent book and I am definitely going to read the others.

B000005YZM|3.0|Odessey & Oracle, the second and final (spinal) Zombies album, starts off with a nice enough song, a tongue-in-cheek pop ditty about a boy's letter to his girlfriend in prison, but she'll be getting out soon, and \\"it'll be so nice\\" to have her back.  Very tongue-in-cheek lyrics and a nice backing track, which told me I was on the way into a psychedelic masterpiece, which I've often heard this album called.<br /><br />We-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ll, it's a nice record.  I'm sure if the Zombies decided to continue as a band, they would have bounced back from this one.  Everything is just so - - NICE - - about this record.  Nice melodies, nice singing, nice mellotron.  However, all of these ingredients need a master chef to stir them all together to make a really great dish, but the production values are just not there - please don't bother trying to find them.  When Al Kooper found this album in England, he noticed there was no United States release, and brought the album back here and begged Clive Davis to release it through Columbia.  Kooper imagined 3 hit singles from this record, and I think I know which ones he meant - the aforementioned opening prison love letter song, a beautiful, almost-acapella tune called \\"Changes\\" and, of course, \\"Time of the Season\\", which feels like it was tacked-on at the end for the American market.  With contemporary albums such as Pet Sounds, Sgt Pepper, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, there's a feeling of consistency, continuity, coherence - three ingredients which pull these albums gradually and subtly to their respective climaxes - Caroline No, A Day In the Life and Bike. Odessey & Oracle doesn't have that.  It sounds like the sort of album from which pop music was pulling away - just a slapdash collection of tunes, then the hit single to make the suits wipe the sweat from their brows.<br /><br />Truthfully, I sat with this album as a whole for the first time yesterday, 07-23-12, and visited several websites to read as much as I could about the band and the making of this album.  The fact that it was recorded on a low budget, and sounded hollow in some sections, not to mention the fact that the band was forced to pay for the stereo mixing sessions out-of-pocket, somehow made the slapdash, ragtag sound of it all make vivid sense.  The Zombies had had enough of lack of interest from both record buyers and record promoters, and the ensuing lack of money - this turned into a lack of morale which made them fight among themselves, which made them not only want to disband after finishing the album, they weren't very keen on finishing it at all - we're lucky they even did.<br /><br />If other groups had tackled this material, who knows what sort of smash they would have had on their hands.  The songs are nice and melodic and beautiful enough to be really spectacular, but without a supportive producer and engineer to bring these potentially beautiful songs to life, it just lay there like a dud.  I don't hate this album, there are some things I like about it, but it's not quite the masterpiece it could have been, and I can hear the potential, too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game. I play at least a few of these puzzles every day. And then start at the beginning again. A nice way to keep the brain working without straining.
1936608898|5.0|I've read many books similar to this one.  In fact, you could call me a nutrition food book junkie.  So far, I like ISWF (It Starts With Food) the most. The Hartwigs not only make a compelling argument for adopting a Paleo lifestyle but they make the information interesting and accessible.  No slogging through endless technical garb, statistics, and studies.  They have compiled the take home message from several important health books (The Paleo Solution: The Original Human Diet by Robb Wolf and Loren Cordain Ph.D, Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It by Gary Taubes , The End of Overeating: Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite by David Kessler, The Schwarzbein Principle: The Truth About Losing Weight, Being Healthy, and Feeling Younger Diana Schwarzbein&  Nancy Deville to name a few)  and put it into one concise easy to read format.  And they made it enjoyable to read.  I laughed out loud more than once.  ISWF is highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is THE most offensive piece of trash I have ever seen!  I couldn't even get all the way through it!  How degrading and offensive to women as well as men!  This book just set women back 100 years!  Is this really the way people want to be treated?!  This is demented!

One of the best musical scores in movie history.<br />Great musclecar, hott chix, angry jawas, plenty o' guns & knives, killer flying chrome baseballs...  just good clean fun!<br /><br />This movie has a very special place in my heart, and among my more than 200+ horror/scary movie collection.<br /><br />BUY.

B003Y5HWMW|4.0|The blu-ray complete first season of Game of Thrones brings what the fan expected. Great video and sound quality and a good variety of extras.<br /><br />If a complain must be done, it is only on the organization of the information. There is a single menu for all the blu-rays, which is a great idea, but you don´t know what exactly is in each of the blu-rays. So, if you put the blu-ray n. 1 and asks to see the 4th episode, you will have to change the discs, which means the menu will have to load all again. Better would be if the content of each disc was highlighted in the menu, so that the user could identify all he/she could see without needing to change discs.<br /><br />Except for that, recommend the product and keep waiting for the second season!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The cover fits perfectly to the Fire providing it with excellent protection. It is easy to open ,and is comfortable to leave on the Fire while it is in use.<br />The only negative is the weak catch that allows the case to double as a stand.The catch slot is not deep enough, so it collapses easily.<br />I plan on using the cover indefinitely.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|The best movie I had seen in a long time. It is simply the best bloody horror comedy since \\"Evil Dead 2\\".
B0088WJQ1G|5.0|If you're a fan of The Swell Season and/or The Frames, I think it's a safe bet, that you'll really like Hansard's solo effort. In each album of the Frames you can hear the evolution of their sound and songwriting. With the Swell Season, Hansard explored a softer more dream-like musicality. This album sounds like the next step. A combination of the dreamlike melodies, with the soul baring lyrics we love from Hansard. He seems to be writing without having to fit into pre-existing niche of Rock Band or Singer Songwriter. It's just him, writing songs. Many of them about heartbreak. But maybe just like Adele, we need our best artists to be miserable because that's when they create gold. Like Bird of Sorrow and Maybe Not Tonight. Soooo gooood!
B002CNST10|5.0|Dad rock, what a flattering concept.  Muse usues classic rock influences to create their own thing.  When I'm listening I always think: man, Muse is over the top crazy.  They put the 'b' in bombastic.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is one of the worst written books that I have ever read.  A complete waste of time and money. 2 stars is being generous.
B001HN690O|5.0|I love the fact that the blu ray has great bonus features. The movie is great and more than what I expected. The plot is  very interesting and a great continuation from the first. Love the new characters and the old ones are still great. Has a very deep and fun story. Great for kids and adults. If there is a KFP3 I will be watching.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was a great book and I couldn't wait for the second one.  It is easy to relate to the characters and there is plenty of mystery and mythology to follow.

1594202842|1.0|Amy Chua is nuts but she doesn't know it. She is presumptuous that all Chinese American parents have her warped set of values. I found her lack of self-reflection incredible. She has no idea how awful she sounds. But the most disturbing aspect of the book is her complete lack of humility, a virtue here and in Asia. She never stops boasting about herself. Shame on her. It's offensive.
B005JS7W4K|4.0|This is an excellent and very reasonably priced box set of Tim Buckley's early and mid-period work.  I give it 4 rather than 5 stars because in reproducing LP covers on cd jackets, the print is virtually illegible, and the albums that were originally gatefold covers now have only a front and back.  A booklet with the covers, and personnel listings, would be a much-appreciated addition.  These are minor points compared to the music, which shows Buckley's creative development, stopping short of his final, straight rock albums.  Also, regrettably, Starsailor is missing from this set, and is apparently unavailable on cd (as of when I write this, July 24, 2012).
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was an incredible book and Adam Brown is an incredible and a true American Hero and standing by his side is his awesome wife and she is a great American and should be nominated for wife of the century. I am a 100% disabled veteran, and I am proud of Adam's service and his wife's service to him. I will tell you I was crying by the end, it was that powerful to me, and I don't cry easily at all
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I purchased my fire because I love to read and my husband took it and was platting around with it while k was out of town and he downloaded this ha.wand be would not hove by fire back to me.  we play together and it is brest fun.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I'm glad that I have it on my Kindle Fire.  you should get one also, I find that I use it a lot.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I am very pleased with the quality of this firm, rubber case and screen protector. It feels sturdy and comfortable in my hand and slips easily in and out of my purse or pocket. I took time to place the screen protector, and you can't even tell it is on the phone. The clear case matches the iPhone 4S simple look -  also available in Smoke. It's a great deal for a low price.
B004I744AS|5.0|this is really phenomenal.  spanning from the hangman games to the word of the Day feature... it just is another wonderful way to learn something new each day. :)  Ofcourse.... along with being oa great dictionary.  quite thorough.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|Definitely loving the puzzle aspect of this game, but I've become rather frustrated with the &quot;Doubling Numbers&quot; setting not sticking. I unchecked it at one point and now no matter what state the check box is in I only get numbers on one side. Definitely wish I could reverse the setting, as the higher levels are very frustrating when you have to keep zooming in and out and scrolling just to see the numbers for the row/column in which you are working.<br /><br />At least four stars once that is fixed.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|Not funny at all!! The crude humor was over the top and not even inserted (no pun intended) to make the story better. Even the whole role reversal/fish out of water thing fell flat. Wait for it to come to TV if there is nothing else on.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|I sucked at it but it is a good game I woldint git it I will be a wast of tine
0345803485|2.0|Okay, I admit straight up that I succumbed to the herd instinct and wanted to see for myself what all the fuss is about.... a few bucks lighter and still scratching my head, I'm now kindna sorry I did. It could have been worse - at least I didn't buy the rest of this crapology and be trebly racked off. I did my best though to trudge my way thru the nauseating exploits courtesy of the non-dimensional Anastasia, a remarkably naive College Senior no less, and a certain Mr.Grey, who apart from repeatedly doing the ever-gasping and \\"I think I bit my lip again\\" Anastasia, doesn't seem do a whole lot else, but he is somehow beyond rich at the tender young age of 26?<br /><br />Without re-hashing the endless shallow and predictable sex scenes, it's safe to say that if you're expecting this book to deliver erotic romance or hot imaginative sex and leave you with a satisfied after-glow, then you gonna be mighty disappointed.  As someone who appreciates a well-written book, I'm not sure what editing process this author went thru as her book couldn't possibly be more than a first or second draft version....shame on the publisher too...seriously.<br /><br />I really should be giving this quantity over substance effort a one star rating, but it gets two stars purely for the author's neck in bringing mainstream writing to new lows and making a nice killing in the process. Suffice to say, if repetitive smut and teen-like titillation rocks your boat, then this is the book for you....otherwise, save yourself those hard earned few bucks by checking out far more talented and deserving debut writers, albeit in different genres, such as Owen Laukkanen, Randolph O'Toole, John Corey Whaley, etc.<br /><br />Now that I've seen the light that there is indeed a book in everyone, I could do worse than write something with a sassy title like \\"Sixty-Nine Shades of Pink\\" and maybe recoup some of my misspent dough!
034580404X|1.0|A badly-written dime store romance with graphic (though rather unrealistic) sex scenes.  Repetitive in text and content.  I think my 10 year old nephew has better writing skills! I can't understand why it's on the best seller list, unless it's because people can read about non-traditional sex.  I got so tired of reading the same words over and over (how many times can one use \\"oh my\\" in a paragraph?  You would be surprised!), I too started skipping over the graphic sex details. Blah, Blah, Blah.  Save your money!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|It's funny as I look at the reviews of Rock of Ages, both in Amazon and other venues.  I would venture to say anyone who hated it did not grow up in the 80s, and truthfully, the movie primarily meant for that audience, those who were in their teens and early 20s in the late 80s.  Basically, this movie is the soundtrack to my childhood, and that is the feeling it evokes.  I titled a review of this film elsewhere as a glorious celebration of decadence and excess, which is the perfect way to describe the hair metal 80s.  After rock went through its self-important phase (Music for the Elder, BOC, Pink Floyd, David Bowie and Led Zep imagery) and punk phases, they went straight to the self-indulgent phase, and that is what this film so gloriously depicts.  The music is wonderful, but you had to be a hair metal afficionado, and I would say those who hated the film did not like this type of music.  It really is associated with a bygone lifestyle that Cobain and the dirtballs of grunge (although I will admit, I DO like the music) brounght to an ignoble and untimely end.  This hearkens back to a more innocent, or at least less cynical, age when the greatest threat to rock n roll was the PMRC (If you don't know, look it up) and Jerry Falwell.  This is so obviously a charicature on an age that is a caricature of itself.  Tom Cruise is pefectly cast as a rock god so narcissistic, he is almost in love with himself.  Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are quite funny as the hapless owners of the hottest nightclub on the LA Strip (basically a thinly-veiled reference to the real Whiskey a Go Go) and Catherine Zeta Jones is great as the outraged crusader against the Satanic influence of rock.  Finally Paul Giamatti puts in his regular great performance as the sleazy record company guy.  Everyone is obviously having fun in this pic, and since it is a musical, its heightened unrealness just adds to the charm of a nostalgic look back in time.  If you can't take it tongue firmly planted in cheek, don't bother.  But otherwise, treat yourself.  It is a hoot.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is just like &quot;where's my water &quot;. It's fun, engaging, and challenging, but its already been done. This is great for keeping kids busy.
B008JAGG38|4.0|I am going to repeat the title of this review.  I don't care what anyone says, I love the American Pie movies.  Not the crappy, straight to DVD portions of it, but 1, 2, American Wedding and this little gem.  Despite the gross-out gags and gratuitous nudity, the American Pie franchise is actually quite sweet and a very conservative heart beats underneath.  Good films versus great ones usually work out that way.  You think its about one thing, and it surprises you with depth.  When I first saw American Pie, I didn't want to go, thinking it would just be another vapid, teenage sex comedy.  I was dragged kicking and screaming (I wanted to see The Haunting) and it turned out to be a gem.  The other films have continued this funny but deep trend.  If you can handle it, I would suggest this film.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|i saw the movie today great story line and action i really enjoy this movie and christian bale one hell of job playing Batman for this generation i cant wait until the dvd comes out. Great beginning n ending one of the best super hero movie for this summer the year 2012. I didnt wanna leave the theater when the movie was over i wanted to watch it again lol.great batman movie

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had heard this book mentioned on different occasions but the 1 that specifically stood out came from a cross fit work out partner who was reading it. She said that it was basically female porn, so of coarse my interest was peaked. I was so curious I didn't wait for her to finish so I could just read her copy I purchased my own download to my e-book from you guys. It was not nearly as good as I expected. It was acceptable reading but I was really waiting to be hot and bothered. Which never happened. I am going to download the others just so I can see if the trilogy gets any better. I didn't like the way it left you kinda hanging out there. Will review the next one's also.
B008CPBB0I|5.0|Kids loved it, teenagers loved it, and adults loved it.  Entertainment for the whole family, does not get any better than that.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a really entertaining and slightly addictive game. I had fun with it and kept going for about an hour the first time.<br /><br />I immediately began sharing it with my friends. They began downloading it and having fun with it right away.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I'm going to make this short and simple: Community is smart, sweet, and funny in a society that is increasingly dumb, hollow, and cynical.  This especially goes for what we see on television.  Community gives me hope for the future of entertainment and television.  The show cares so much for its audience and is so genuine.  You can tell everyone has a blast making it, and only wants to deliver the best to those watching.  And, its REALLY funny.  Not just chuckle, chuckle funny, but laugh-out-loud funny.  It's so endearing, you can easily watch multiple episodes in a row.  I have a huge smile on my face the whole time.  TV today is so jaded.  Community is like a beacon of hope, full of smiles and laughs.
B008BRC6NS|5.0|When it comes to artists who have had a lot of success, it's very difficult to put together a greatest hits compilation without leaving out some great songs. Unfortunately in this case I find it hard to overlook the absences of \\"Play\\", \\"Aint It Funny Original\\" ,\\"No Me Ames\\",\\" I'm Real Remix\\" especially when songs like \\"Feeling So Good\\", \\"Do It Well\\" made the cut... Besides this, it's a well put together compilation and a must-have for all JLovers.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|A pretty funny depiction of sentimentality, scatology and bacchanal sexualtity.  The characters are generally sympathetic, despite their tempestuous behavior and the plot itself is tangentially believable.  Plus, you get to see naked organs and whatnot  Seriously... Eugene Levy with his deadpan acting, as always, makes this thing work and I look forward to seeing him perform again in the very near future.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i really like this game a lot and it is loads of fun and the graphics are really good yeah!
B005OK721G|5.0|While the movie has a few anachronisms, the pace is fast enough that it's easy not to notice. Highly recommended for its roller coaster-style action sequences. I do wish they had dispensed with the hand-to-hand combat, which isn't very realistic when the 100 lb heroine knocks out her 200 lb opponent. Maybe if she was wielding a large knife or something. Besides, what's wrong with gun-only action scenes?
B000V5W84U|3.0|It was clear in the first episode of the season, \\"Emissary\\", that the \\"Prophets\\" were astonished and in disbelief (perhaps even horrified) that linear-time organics like Sisko (let alone the Bajorans that worship them) could even exist. So regardless of the arguments made by the anti-rationalist reviewer here, the one unimpeachable truth we (and Sisko -- though he never brings it up) do know is that the beings living in the wormhole (whatever they are) haven't the slightest clue that a planet of linear-time meatbags have embraced them as gods and built an entire culture around them via religion. With that one irreproachable fact, the Bajoran belief system is rendered false and any other argument becomes superfluous.<br /><br />With that in mind, this episode is about an attempt at political conquest -- people trying to control other people. Religion and murder are simply the means (and time-honored ones at that).
1611133408|5.0|I loved this new take on fairy tales by Chris Colfer and the audio version was a pure delight. Although this book is labeled for youngsters, I would say it is for the young at heart! Listening to the audio version while I drove in traffic was such a breath of fresh air.<br />With all the reviews, I don't need to give you the details of this book..... others have done that.  I just want to go on record saying I highly recommend this book and give it 5 stars. I seriously hope this new author has more books to come. He has a great imagination and I love where he took us in this book. What a great ride!<br />JMHO  //(*_*)\\
1932100660|5.0|Having been a longtime vegetarian, I long believed in the nutritional properties of some animal products including dairy and eggs, primarily because of the messages we are bombarded with through advertisements and habit. As someone who also believes in the power of science and empirical research, I could not put Dr. Campbell's work down. The evidence is incredibly compelling, considering that Dr. Campbell himself set out to conduct the research believing animal protein was healthful and discovered just the opposite. The book is incredibly well written and accessible for all audiences. I enjoyed learning about others doing work similar to Dr. Campbell's, suggesting that the evidence of health benefits for a plant-based diet is increasing. Also eye opening is Dr. Campbell's description of how certain industries twist information in order to maintain their profits and the status quo. As someone who wants to live a long healthy life to the fullest, I feel that Dr. Campbell's work and the work of others (whom he refers to throughout the book, also doing some incredible work) cannot be ignored.
0446572993|5.0|This was my first David B. read and I loved it.  After a stressful day at work and demands of a family, this was a great way to escape for a bit.  Since then I have picked up 2 used copies of some of his other books and I can't wait to get started.  As I read each time, I would think that I needed to stop on the last page of the chapter only to start on the next and say the same thing about the upcoming last page.  I hated to see it end!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|With the multitude of post apocalypse america writing out there this one at least has some uplifting notes at the end.  But this is quite violent for a young adult novel. I read it because the movie was popular and well done. I don't think I would recommend this for children.
B0086700CM|4.0|little bit of a repetetive grind at times. but all in all its a very fun distraction! it is a bit unresponsive at times though. that can be frustating
0439023521|5.0|I've just finished reading this novel and am incredibly impressed with Suzanne Collins' ability to see what the \\"bread and circuses\\" of the future may very well be. I'm even more impressed with her ability to write a novel set in that grim future and to create a hero, Katniss Everdeen, who is both victim and victor. In this story, written in the present tense from Katniss's point of view, I was immediately drawn into the action and felt great empathy for the people of District 12. Later, as I got to know more about the nation called Panem, which exists where North America once stood, I felt empathy for most of the other districts, even though I wasn't yet introduced to them.<br /><br />The Hunger Games operates on several different levels -- as a survival novel, as a political novel, as a coming-of-age novel. On all these levels, it's uniformly excellent. The writing is smooth, the sentences lead the reader always forward. The characters (Katniss, Gale, Peeta, Haymitch, Cinna, etc.) are all well-drawn, with depths beyond what the novel's words describe. The action is almost nonstop. And, like the best of fiction, The Hunger Games is moral: it calls for taking sides for or against the rulers of Panem, for or against the workers from Distrcits 1-12 who produce the wealth but receive none of it. Highly Recommended.
B003FXXNH6|5.0|this movie is great because most of the fighters in this movie are real martial artists not like some other movies which the actor who don't really train in martial arts like never back down and stuff it's overrated also another reason why i think this movie is great because it has Scott Adkins in it and i think he is just a bad ass because his fighting style awesome which i really like out all fighters in this movie also Lateef  Crowder's style just insanely cool but it sucked that he dies in movie<br />so far this one and the second one are the best fighting movies in my opinion cause most MMA movies  just have boxing,kickboxing,Muay Thai and just regular Brazilian jujitsu like in this movie it has each fighter with a different discipline's like dolor has wing chun,Bruce lee style. lateef has Capoeira.<br /><br />Scott has a balanced style mixed with Muay Thai, Japanese jujitsu,judo and some karate in it judging from some the kicks when he fight's lateef<br />so yeah watch this movie i think its great in my opinion

0345803485|1.0|I won't make this a long review because everything has pretty much been articulated in countless reviews from people who wanted to give this ZERO stars, however could not due to the mechanism of this system. Extract all those forced 1 stars (mandatory for posting a review), and this book is in the negative column. Still, women keep buying it.<br /><br />Initially, I thought I was the only female alive who found this book ridiculous on every imaginable level, until I noticed late night and daytime talk show hosts commenting about readers wanting a refund. Well, not horny women who have apparently never read good erotica. Pick up Anais Nin if you want intelligent, stimulating erotica.<br /><br />I barely read to Chapter 2 when an acquaintance at a party suggested it didn't really get good until later chapters. Really? Do the innumerable cliches stop and the sex scenes become believable??? So, foolish me, I gave it another try. Not only was this implausible storyline a waste of time and energy, I wondered about the life of my acquaintance and others who recommend it. Are they desperately in need of an orgasm? Married, but frustrated as hell because their husbands aren't taking care of them in the bedroom? How this turned into a best seller is still a mystery, however I've spoken with countless women who feel embarrassed that they put out $9.99 for the Kindle book, based on hype.<br /><br />If you're still determined to plunk down cash because others have, please read as many reviews as possible before investing your TIME. Ask your avid reader friends, and any intellectual folks you know. My suggestion: If you're looking for erotica, read Erica Jong's phenomenal \\"Fear of Flying,\\" and if you want bondage in the mix, check out Anais Nin - she's the real deal.<br /><br />I'm sure the movie version will not have it's Ana character constantly blushing, biting her lips, reaching climax every time her man breathes in and out, or allow her to say things like \\"Holy crap\\" my \\"down there\\" and the zillion other asinine comments issued by the heroine. Christian Grey's character will be easy, since both men (especially my gay guy friends) and women are drawn to twenty-something billionaires who are hung like porn stars.n there\\" and the zillion other asinine comments issued by the heroine.

B0081KTI0E|5.0|I missed seeing this movie when it was playing in theaters. So I was happy to watch it here on Amazon. Daniel Radcliffe's performance was excellent just as it was when he played Harry Potter.Really enjoyed movie. I love the \\"Spooky\\" movies,always have.This version of The Woman in Black was an  improvement in my opinion over an earlier version no doubt because young Daniel was the principle actor.Movie certainly worth watching.

It was very repetative. I'm sure it was the specific sexual content that drove the 3 books to #1.  Story wise it's meh.
B008JOK59K|5.0|Fans of Gaslight Anthem will find 2012's HANDWRITTEN be familiar.  The band's sound is like a beaten up pair of Chuck Taylor's.  Gaslight Anthem is rough around the edges, old-school, raw, but comfortable.  With prolific producer Brendan O'Brien (Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam, Incubus), the band's sound remains full of passion and energy but crystal-clear.  While their sound may not be specifically unique, they are a breath of fresh air in a musical climate dominated with electronics.<br /><br />The album begins with its lead single, \\"45.\\"  The song isn't just one of the best songs on the album - I'd argue it's one of the best of the band's career.  It's a solid homage to the days of vinyl, and it perfectly surmises the band and HANDWRITTEN.  Gaslight Anthem has always been one to salute their predecessors, and \\"45\\" cuts to the core of that matter.  The second and title track, \\"Handwritten,\\" scores another do-it-yourself anthem for the band.  The album's title is particularly apt: the band wears its heart and influences on its sleeve like a badge of honor - the music and lyrics all sound organic and, well, handwritten.  \\"Too Much Blood\\" has a stomping guitar riff that surrounds great vocals via Brian Fallon; in many ways, it feels tired and exhausted, but because it feels full of soul, it never feels like a drag.  Clocking in at just over 2 minutes, \\"Howl\\" compacts many of Gaslight Anthem's best qualities into a tight rocking song.  The first song written for the album, \\"Biloxi Parrish\\" also serves as a highlight with its heartfelt melody paired with blistering guitar work.  The penultimate song, \\"Mae,\\" slows the album down towards ballad territory, but the result is a song that is just as strong as \\"Too Much Blood.\\"  The closing track, \\"National Anthem\\" finds the band hanging up their amplifiers for acoustic guitars.  The song's lyrics (provided by vocalist Brian Fallon) are poignant, and it provides a slow, soft close to HANDWRITTEN.<br /><br />HANDWRITTEN is an album that is, above everything else, full of heart and passion.  Many of these songs grow better and better with repeated listens, so it is an album worth sticking with for a while.  Fans of The Hold Steady, Japandroids, or Bruce Springsteen will probably find a lot to enjoy in HANDWRITTEN.  However, I don't think that this is the best album to begin listening to the band; [[ASIN:B001DWXUWY THE '59 SOUND]] would probably serve as a better starting point.  Standout tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B007Y5W4GW 45]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B008JOKA4K Too Much Blood]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B008JOKAHW Howl]].\\"<br /><br />(additional release information)<br />The deluxe edition of [[ASIN:B008KTA64S HANDWRITTEN]] includes three additional bonus tracks.  These tracks (in order) are: \\"Blue Dahlia,\\" \\"Sliver (Nirvana cover),\\" and \\"You Got Lucky (Tom Petty cover).\\"  Out of these, the Tom Petty cover might be my favorite -- I'd highly recommend any die-hard Gaslight Anthem fan to seek the deluxe edition out.bum that is, above everything else, full of heart and passion.

B0086AYAQ6|4.0|This disc constitutes Valentina Lisitsa's solo debut on Decca, offering a selection of her generous two-hour Royal Albert Hall recital held just over a month ago on 19 June. There are so many positive and inspiring things to note about the fact that one of today's most gifted and interesting pianists finally has received the recognition and platform she deserves.<br /><br />At the beginning of 2007, the 39-year-old Ukrainian-born and -trained pianist found herself without an audience. As Lisitsa put it at the beginning of the concert in her lovably unlaboured and self-ironic manner, 'in the Jurassic age of YouTube, [...] I was living in North Carolina, in the beautiful countryside, with husband and young baby, and I had no work as a musician--it was very frustrating.' Uncommonly creative and bold as she evidently is, instead of going ahead with submitting an already filled out online application for a secure office position with the CIA ('to do nothing else but to read the news and give your opinion'), she began creating her own audience through YouTube, eventually ending up with literally millions of fans--and this sense of creativity and boldness also permeates Lisitsa's playing. It is actually somewhat ironic that in our digital age, where the paradigm of piano playing has become nearly synonymous with computerised perfection, the most viewed pianist online takes us back nearly a century to the Golden Age of pianism. Even though Lisitsa's digital dexterity is impossible to question, her warm, singing, impetuous and highly personal style offers the perfect antidote to the likes of Pollini, Perahia, Andsnes and Yundi--that is 'far removed from the prestidigitatory typewriters that many of today's pianists have become', to quote Tom Service's blog on the Guardian, posted four days ahead of the concert.<br /><br />The programme for the Royal Albert Hall recital is boldly ambitious but also thoughtfully composed: an 'overture' in the form of Liszt's 12th Hungarian Rhapsody, leading to a combined section of Mozart's C-minor Fantasy and three Schubert-Liszt song transcriptions, ending the first half with Beethoven's 14th Piano Sonata; the second half starting with Etudes and Preludes by Rachmaninov, followed by Poemes and Etudes by Scriabin, three Nocturnes by Chopin and concluding most thrillingly with Liszt's Totentanz. Regrettably, Decca chose a seemingly arbitrary and rather silly potpourri layout for the CD selection. The three largest pieces (save the Beethoven Sonata) were all excluded in favour of popular encore pieces, of which only La Campanella was performed during the actual concert due to lack of time (the others were recorded 'in the quiet after everybody is gone', as Lisitsa put it herself at the end of the concert).<br /><br />Lisitsa's style of playing is ideally suited to Liszt and Rachmaninov: her extensive YouTube archive includes absolutely masterful performances of the former's Second Ballade and Don Juan Reminiscences as well as the latter's First Sonata and the piano parts of the first two Concertos (by the way, a highly refreshing way of hearing her forthcoming recording with orchestra). Her Royal Albert Hall performances of the 12th Hungarian Rhapsody stunningly marries virtuoso display with genuine musicality, the La Campanella is taken at such lightning-fast speed as to almost challenge the near-unhuman live accounts by Gavrilov and Kissin, whereas the Totentanz is partly jaw-dropping and partly derailing--confirming just how fiendishly difficult this pianistic masterpiece really is. As for Rachmaninov, her A-minor Etude-Tableaux is dazzling, her G-major Prelude ravishing and the marvellous B-minor Prelude is given one of the most deeply tragic readings I have come across.<br /><br />Lisitsa's [[ASIN:B0002KZXAU 2004 DVD of the 24 Chopin Etudes]] is simply stupendous. That said, her three selected Nocturnes are somewhat too aggressively impatient to my taste--just as those of Argerich. The great C-minorNocturne, one of Chopin's most profoundly heartbreaking creations, was indeed 'one of several pieces whose subtlety was dissipated in febrility', as noted in Ivan Hewett's review for the Telegraph (I think he was also referring to the Scriabin D-major Poeme and the Rachmaninov G-minor Prelude). On the other hand, Lisitsa's Mozart Fantasy is suitably dark--she refers to it as the 'Dark Fantasy' in her evocative programme notes; similarly, her seriously unimpressionistic 'Moonlight' Sonata takes its point of departure from her remarks that this is in no way a prelude to Clair de Lune, but rather a 'suicide note' in a form approaching that of a funeral march (referring to its first movement).<br /><br />As for the encores that never had time to materialise during the actual concert, they are played both with romantic warmth and finesse--I particularly like Lisitsa's elastic Un sospiro. Nevertheless, the non-live remake of La Campanella has marginally less adrenaline, indicating that the encores likely would have benefitted from the live atmosphere, as the enthusiastic audience went wild after the Totentanz.<br /><br />I first listened to this CD through Spotify (where it became available a few weeks back), before realising that the concert is available it its entirety at YouTube (in excellent HD quality). Strangely enough, it appears as if the [[ASIN:B008B11S1A Decca DVD]] (just about to be released here in Europe) contains the same selection as the CD--which is indeed a shame since leaving out both the two larger Liszt pieces and song transcriptions as well as the Mozart Fantasy. Therefore, at this moment my main recommendation is to buy the CD for commercial reasons and the non-live encores, but to watch the concert in its entirety on YouTube (including that gorgeous B&ouml;sendorfer Imperial Grand). That is to ensure that Lisitsa's Golden Age pianism can continue to conquer digital age audiences...Nocturne, one of Chopin's most profoundly heartbreaking creations, was indeed 'one of several pieces whose subtlety was dissipated in febrility', as noted in Ivan Hewett's review for the Telegraph (I think he was also referring to the Scriabin D-major Poeme and the Rachmaninov G-minor Prelude). On the other hand, Lisitsa's Mozart Fantasy is suitably dark--she refers to it as the 'Dark Fantasy' in her evocative programme notes; similarly, her seriously unimpressionistic 'Moonlight' Sonata takes its point of departure from her remarks that this is in no way a prelude to Clair de Lune, but rather a 'suicide note' in a form approaching that of a funeral march (referring to its first movement).<br /><br />As for the encores that never had time to materialise during the actual concert, they are played both with romantic warmth and finesse--I particularly like Lisitsa's elastic Un sospiro.

B008JIFJ4W|4.0|Passion Pit's sophomore album, GOSSAMER, won't let fans down.  In fact, this album is in many ways, better than its predecessor, [[ASIN:B003FF8EAU MANNERS]].  It's a more consistent record, and in GOSSAMER, Passion Pit isn't afraid to reach for pop-status or radio-friendly alternative.  Even though the production of GOSSAMER has been shrouded with stories about Michael Angelakos' mental health issues (a link will be provided in the comments of this review to those that are interested), the album rarely seems troubled.  Fans of the band will be excited to find that the band has expanded its songwriting craft: the emotions are more present here, the choruses bigger, and the production more streamlined.  Passion Pit's second album is pretty accessible, but it only grows better with repeated listens.<br /><br />The album begins with its propulsive lead single, \\"Take a Walk.\\" It's a socially-conscious and introspective song, but what it carries in thematic heft (it's probably the only song I've ever heard on the radio to talk about foreclosures and pension funds), it also provides in enduring melody.  The band's refrain during the chorus (\\"take a walk, take a walk.\\") aren't just echos of the lead vocals -- they're meant as instructions/reminders to the public at large.  The album slows for \\"Constant Conversations,\\" which serves as a pretty divisive track; the spacey R&B is complimented by the Swedish acapella group [[ASIN:B006MEHTXO Erato]].  The song serves not only as a departure in terms of tone and rhythm, but also one of style.  The next song, \\"Mirrored Sea\\" brings GOSSAMER back into Passion Pit's wheelhouse - it's a track with a soaring, atmospheric chorus that sticks with listeners long after it's over.  Following up \\"Mirrored Sea\\" is \\"Cry Like a Ghost,\\" another slower song, but its groove carries the song much better than \\"Constant Conversations.\\"  \\"Two Veils to Hide My Face\\" is an acapella arrangement that is pretty, but short (33 seconds) - it feels less like a song and more like an introduction to \\"Love is Greed.\\"  The closing \\"Where We Belong\\" begins drenched in fluttering synthesizers and ends in a cathartic refrain.  It's a beautiful closer to the album.<br /><br />Because many of these songs are layered with a glossy production, it takes repeated listens to pick up on all of the nuance that exist in each of these tracks.  Fans of M83, Grouplove, or The Naked and Famous ought to love GOSSAMER.  Fans of the band's MANNERS should definitely check on this release, but if you've never even heard of the band, this album is still a great place to start listening.  Standout songs to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B008JIFJO2 Take A Walk]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B008JIFM08 Mirrored Sea]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B008JIFK5U I'll Be Alright]].\\"<br /><br />(additional release information)<br />The iTunes edition of GOSSAMER includes a bonus track: \\"American Blood.\\"song and more like an introduction to \\"Love is Greed.\\"  The closing \\"Where We Belong\\" begins drenched in fluttering synthesizers and ends in a cathartic refrain.

B008KTA64S|5.0|Fans of Gaslight Anthem will find 2012's HANDWRITTEN be familiar.  The band's sound is like a beaten up pair of Chuck Taylor's.  Gaslight Anthem is rough around the edges, old-school, raw, but comfortable.  With prolific producer Brendan O'Brien (Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam, Incubus), the band's sound remains full of passion and energy but crystal-clear.  While their sound may not be specifically unique, they are a breath of fresh air in a musical climate dominated with electronics.<br /><br />The album begins with its lead single, \\"45.\\"  The song isn't just one of the best songs on the album - I'd argue it's one of the best of the band's career.  It's a solid homage to the days of vinyl, and it perfectly surmises the band and HANDWRITTEN.  Gaslight Anthem has always been one to salute their predecessors, and \\"45\\" cuts to the core of that matter.  The second and title track, \\"Handwritten,\\" scores another do-it-yourself anthem for the band.  The album's title is particularly apt: the band wears its heart and influences on its sleeve like a badge of honor - the music and lyrics all sound organic and, well, handwritten.  \\"Too Much Blood\\" has a stomping guitar riff that surrounds great vocals via Brian Fallon; in many ways, it feels tired and exhausted, but because it feels full of soul, it never feels like a drag.  Clocking in at just over 2 minutes, \\"Howl\\" compacts many of Gaslight Anthem's best qualities into a tight rocking song.  The first song written for the album, \\"Biloxi Parrish\\" also serves as a highlight with its heartfelt melody paired with blistering guitar work.  The penultimate song, \\"Mae,\\" slows the album down towards ballad territory, but the result is a song that is just as strong as \\"Too Much Blood.\\"  The closing track, \\"National Anthem\\" finds the band hanging up their amplifiers for acoustic guitars.  The song's lyrics (provided by vocalist Brian Fallon) are poignant, and it provides a slow, soft close to HANDWRITTEN.<br /><br />HANDWRITTEN is an album that is, above everything else, full of heart and passion.  Many of these songs grow better and better with repeated listens, so it is an album worth sticking with for a while.  Fans of The Hold Steady, Japandroids, or Bruce Springsteen will probably find a lot to enjoy in HANDWRITTEN.  However, I don't think that this is the best album to begin listening to the band; [[ASIN:B001DWXUWY THE '59 SOUND]] would probably serve as a better starting point.  Standout tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B007Y5W4GW 45]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B008JOKA4K Too Much Blood]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B008JOKAHW Howl]].\\"<br /><br />(additional release information)<br />The deluxe edition of [[ASIN:B008KTA64S HANDWRITTEN]] includes three additional bonus tracks.  These tracks (in order) are: \\"Blue Dahlia,\\" \\"Sliver (Nirvana cover),\\" and \\"You Got Lucky (Tom Petty cover).\\"  Out of these, the Tom Petty cover might be my favorite -- I'd highly recommend any die-hard Gaslight Anthem fan to seek the deluxe edition out.  If you're not interested in these extra songs, there is a separate (slightly cheaper) version: [[ASIN:B008KT9SSI HANDWRITTEN (+digital booklet)]].bum that is, above everything else, full of heart and passion.

B000BPG2JC|3.0|While the writing was not always clear in this book and the story sometimes dragged, it was an entertaining read and fun to get to know new characters in what looks to be a good series. What I think I like the most (other than Walt being an alumni at the same school as I went to) is the fact that the author is not afraid to tackle things that aren't seen in mainstream mysteries such as non christian spirituality. The chapter about the Old Cheyenne was beautiful. I can't wait to see how these characters grow and change.
B002W1UEW4|1.0|Transformers, based on a toy action figure set and animated series, had some interesting characters and a little bit of emotional pull. Some of the characters were memorable (i.e. Bumblebee, the car and Sam Witwicky was likeable and even believable).<br /><br />\\"GI Joe Rise of Cobra\\" -- also based on a toy and animated series, apparently missed what made Transformers a relatively good movie - that is, believable and likeable characters and some drama, besides the unending explosions and destruction that are staples of this type of film.<br /><br />We get treated to enough testosterone from all the cast (male AND female) and so much macho posturing (also from male and female characters) that the movie becomes more plastic than the figures upon which the movie is loosely based.<br /><br />In short, this movie is structured like a 12 year old boy's fantasy come to life. And I expect that's who will appreciate this movie the most. Nothing wrong with  that except, shouldn't a movie have more going for it... like characters and a sensible plot and maybe teach something or impart some wisdom? Isn't the point of play ultimately a learning experience?<br /><br />There's is plenty of action along the line of Star Wars (except Star Wars did it better), along with absolutely unbelievably advanced technology and villains who are so irredeemable and unlikeable, they are pure plastic caricatures of themselves!<br /><br />Much of the acting talent is wasted here in favor of constant posturing -- who is more macho, butch, rough and tough on the part of the \\"Joes\\", and who is more evil, cunning and ruthless among the legions of COBRA. It's like reading the blurb on the back of the toy's packaging!<br /><br />The movie is also loaded with meaningless dialog that seemed to be filler for the CGI effects. And the logic of the characters makes even less sense. For example, when the hero, Duke, has a chance to stop the extremely and pointlessly evil Doctor Rex (who has turned evil because he got blown up in a bunker of some sort and Duke gave him up for dead) he starts arguing with him! Any sensible soldier would have at least wounded the guy to put him out of action. It IS possible to disarm someone without killing them.<br /><br />And of course, it works the other way around. While the Cobra folks wage battles with the Joes, and plenty of \\"extras\\" are wounded and killed on both sides (picture a 12 year old with the toys, smashing them against each other and bouncing them off walls and you've pretty much got this movie down), the principle characters insist on arguing with each other instead of disarming each other. And remember, the villains are bent on destroying the world (except for their main opponents apparently) without a second thought.<br /><br />This whole movie is just plain silly. You might enjoy it for the special effects (if you like seeing things explode a lot) and some of the technology (cool looking submarines, planes and land vehicles) but if you are able to think logically, this movie will annoy you more that anything else.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie is more than just as plastic as the toys... it's as recycled as the plastic is.<br /><br />You'll recognize scenes lifted from the \\"Day The Earth Stood Still\\" remake, \\"Independence Day\\", and of course \\"Star Wars\\", to name a few obvious rip-offs. For example, in this movie we see two rival ninjas with swords battling it out in the hi-tech, electrically sparking COBRA base. We saw the same thing in Star Wars, the two Jedi knights (Obi Wan and Darth Vader) with light sabres battling it out among sparks in the Death Star. Different location, same idea. Star Wars did it better.<br /><br />It might be kind of fun to watch the movie, just to see how much they rip off from other films, could make for an interesting trivia game.<br /><br />And again, if you like seeing mass destruction for no reason, on a really grand scale, this could be the movie for you. As kids we used to try and blow up our GI Joe toys. Nice to know that Hollywood finally did it for us in grand CGI style.<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />GI Joe, the action figure, was a male response to the enormous popularity of Barbie. Is was a marketing success. The idea of getting boys to play with dolls when GI Joe came out was unbelievable. But it worked.<br /><br />The idea that this movie could make any sense is almost as unbelievable, but this time, it doesn't work.<br /><br />Go back to your own GI Joe fantasies, they'll be more satisfying.low up our GI Joe toys.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It will be difficult to write this review without giving any spoilers away, but I'm going to do my best!<br /><br />It's been ages since I've read through a series of books so quickly, but \\"The Hunger Games\\" series had me devouring each page of the trilogy as quickly as I could.  There were a few points in the book where things dragged on a bit slowly, but overall it kept me riveted and I absolutely couldn't wait to find out how events would unfold.  I did find myself wanting more out of the ending of the book, but I respect the way the author wrapped up the series. I think \\"Mockingjay\\" is a fitting conclusion, and I suspect I'll be reading through this trilogy again at some point in the not-so-distant future.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is a Great Beatles cirque du soleil LOVE soundtrack.  The music flows perfectly from one song to the next song.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I like every song on \\"Making Mirrors\\" for a different reason. Gotye does sound a lot like Sting and Peter Gabriel, but the musical arrangements and the themes of his songs set him apart from the other singers.  Some of these songs I enjoy because of the melody and musical arrangements.  I like the funky sound of a song like \\"Easy Way Out\\" and the soothing tone of a song like \\"Bronte\\".  \\"Giving Me A Chance\\" is a song with good keyboard playing and percussion instruments.  There are songs on this album that uplift me just by the lyrical content. I love the song \\"Save Me\\".  This is a song about a person's life is transformed by the love of another person.  The words are very moving on this song.  \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" is actually my favorite tune on here.  I love the beat of the song and the lyrical line We walk the plank with our eyes wide open.  I can relate to these lyrics a lot.  There are a lot of times I get into things with no idea of what to do.  This song raises my consciousness of how my actions affect other people. \\"In Your Light\\" is an excellent upbeat track.  This song simply makes me happy.  The saxophone playing is good on this record.  I like the  musical arrangement of \\"Smoke And Mirrors\\".  The tone of this song puts me at ease.  \\"State Of The Art\\" has a groovy retro tone that I love.  \\"Somebody I Used To Know\\" is a radio hit that gets over played, but I still enjoy listening to it.  I like this album very much.
B000YAA68C|1.0|Didn't get very far in this movie.  The first scene was okay.  The second scene I couldn't even get past.  The memorial service is pretty cheesy, but very \\"New York.\\"  If you like seeing a memorial service at a bar with lots of weird people around, this just may be  your sort of movie...<br /><br />Maybe I was just not in the right mood.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There is nothing redeeming about this book.  Characters:  Boring, uninteresting.  Plot: Nonexistent.  Writing talent:  absent.  The book consists of two people having lots of sex, and when they're not having sex they're exchanging emails, which are written out for you in page after boring page.  Oh wait, there's the pages and pages of the stupid sex contract too as a \\"bonus.\\"  I cannot believe they are making this into a movie.  What a joke.
030758836X|5.0|I've been reading the reviews on this book, and it sounds like an English lit class. I had a professor that used to say he could always count on me to see the fuzzy duckies when I was perplexed by others' comments. Who cares how much sense these details make? This book did something to me not many thrillers can do - it surprised me, and entertained me to the end. My favorite just-plain-fun summer read!
B001BP9ZFO|5.0|Never seen this actor.  Good story about historic figure.  Interesting that Truman became so engrossed in writing his story that he suffered physically
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I started reading this book because everyone was going on and on about it and because I heard it will be made into a movie soon... oh my goodness it is terrible! I'm not a stickler for grammar and I'm definitely not a book snob but this book is badly written. The author tries way too hard to sound smart and she overuses big words.. it was distracting, to say the least.<br /><br />Then there's the actual story, which started off entertaining. But then it becomes... what word can I use?? STUPID. The relationship between Christian and Anna is what most psychologists would label as \\"emotional abuse\\".<br /><br />The main character, Anna, is pathetic and insecure. Christian is egotistical and controlling. That would all be good and great if it weren't for the fact that this is an insecure 21 year old college graduate who hasn't even had a taste of life and if he weren't a 28 year old privileged control freak. Gee I wonder how the last book will end... Fifty Shades Freed. C'mon now.
B000IAZ5HK|2.0|I gave this an extra star for the design and function. It is a well designed dressing shaker that looks beautiful and doesn't drip when pouring.<br /><br />Here are my problems with it:<br />The neck opening is tiny. If you are adding any ingredients that aren't liquid they will stick to the sides of the carafe. All ingredients must be pre poured into a separate container like a measuring cup and then poured into the shaker to avoid any messes.<br />Be careful to not take the stopper off and on-- once there is oil on the sides of the neck the stopper will have more trouble staying on.<br /><br />Finally, the descriptions and instructions on all counts are vague. Is it dishwasher safe? Who knows? I put mine in the dishwasher and the stopper TORE and now it doesn't seal properly. I put in for an exchange and hopefully this is a one time defect, but if troubles persist I will amend this review.

The 2nd book was a little nail bitting and the 3rd book was the love story I was hoping for. But I still hope there is a 4th to this set. I was very happy with my purchace of the 50 Shades Trilogy. I have had so many of my friends wanting to borrow it. I highly recommend it to anyone that loves a little Romance love story with a little naughty.
0439023491|1.0|It was SO dull.  I felt that absolutely NOTHING happened until the last few pages.  I was just reading to get through it and kept thinking: \\"This has got to be it - something has to happen next.  Maybe they'll rebel now.\\" But NOTHING...  And all of those ridiculous descriptions of the food Katniss ate, and the clothes she wore, and how Octavia and her make-over group dressed and acted... Give me a break!  Enough is enough!  If I had a dime for every food description, or how people in the Capitol were dressed, how Katniss' legs were waxed, or how many drinks Haymich had, I'd be as rich as this author.<br /><br />The plot was a complete replica of the first book with minor changes, only worse, because in this book Katniss seems like a wimp who would never survive anything without everyone pampering & protecting her.<br /><br />There's not one bit of creativity in this book.  It seems like it was put out to make money off the first book, which is the only one of the trilogy worth reading in my opinion.

B004UPANAI|5.0|I like this movie, because Wolverine didn't look so stiff and dolled up with his hair over styled and hair<br />sprayed like it was in The Last Stand.  He looked like a real person (who just happens to have blades for fingers and super human abilities) going through emotional things,  and it wasn't about saving the world. This movie seemed like it was aiming for a more sentimental and mature crowd, and I am sooo looking forward to the next Wolverine to get me in a movie theater again.<br />We must remember: no movie is ever true to the book.

It is the biggest piece of trash I have ever read. I wish I could get my 17 bucks back. I also feel like I need to take an 800 hour shower. What filth! I can't believe this is a best seller! This is what our young women are reading?! This author, and her subject matter, are teaching women that being victimized and portrayed as \\"prey\\" is okay, even sexy. She is also teaching low self esteem and that it is okay for a sexual partner dish out pain in what should be an act of intimacy. I am disgusted!
0393088774|5.0|As a follower of Krugman's column in the New York Times I had low expectations from the book. I thought it would be more of the same just a little more elaborated. It turned out that this elaboration was quite important for a deeper understanding of how economies work. I also gained many insights of how the anti-Keynesian minds work. A few years ago, I was debating with a friend some economic policies. Being an economics graduate, I thought I had enough knowledge to conduct this debate until my friend told me, \\"but what you are saying is Keynesian economics\\" I didn't know until then that being a Keynesian is a curse in the eyes of some. I thought that my economics knowledge was outdated, that some new theories are now in vogue. I found out, following this debate, that indeed, there is a new theory dominating mainly the conservatives and other people who are less knowledgeable and in essence more susceptible to campaigns that are heavily financed by people whose personal interest is to inseminate these alternate theories. Krugman, in this book, makes it extremely clear with extensive support by data, that Keynes is still alive and well. That my education is not outdated. One thing I know from being a small business owner. The only way I could hire more people, is if I sell more product. This can come only if demand increases. Contrary to the claims by the anti-Keynesians, my level of confidence has nothing to do with it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this trilogy... I loved how the author captured my heart with each character and wouldn't let me put this book down.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite black keys cd. Even though they are doing covers of Junior's songs they really captured that raw bluesy feel. You will listen to this one over and over!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|OK, so this is not in the least bit tame for the person that is not comfortable with the sexual aspect of the book, but I think without it some of the story would not be as intense. When Ana starts to change his tortured soul, the intensity of those acts become apparent. The developement of their romance takes my breath away. I am reading them for the third time and it gets better each and every time...definitely worth your while.....
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love playing this game on my Kindle Fire.  It is so cute and the graphics are so clear and better than most on facebook! I only wish this was available on facebook, as I haven't figured out how to get neighbors  I know. But the game is playable without neighbors so far. I would play this game on any venue or device.
0385737955|4.0|I'm 26 and havn't really been a big reader. I promised myself I would start reading and started with the Hunger Games. From there, a friend said that I should look into the maze runner. I love thought provoking movies/books and for a basic reader like me, this was definitely a fun and interesting read. It has a lot of open ended plots but throws you right into the middle of the main character's (Tom/Thomas) situation as if you and Tom are trying to figure out what has happened to him.<br /><br />You need to have a bit of an open mind. Those that take books physics serious...won't enjoy the book as much. Allowing yourself to dive into this new world, allows you to live it out and actually picture everything from the maze, to the Grievers, and to the \\"effects\\" of being stung(trying not to spoil).<br /><br />Overall it is a good book and will make you want to buy the second and third. This is probably my 2nd favorite out of the two.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it! Almost better than 50 shades!! Eva is a strong woman and very relatable to many women. Love love loved it
0385738773|4.0|I enjoyed this book the most out of the three. The Scortch Trials to me was a filler to get to this book for the three part series. It brings around many of the plot holes from the first and second book...but also adds a few interesting new ones. Something that really interested me was whether or not you would want your memory back after going through all the torments and trouble of the maze and the scortch trials. Do you WANT to have those memories before that back? Is it worth it? That was something that I kept thinking in my head constantly.<br /><br />One of the negative aspects in it is that after three books, I started thinking exactly as how the writer would start with a twist. Many of the twists in the book started becoming easier to pick out by the end. Though the end of the book did throw me off and not really in a good way...It still was a decent end overall.<br /><br />It does still have the typical love triangle though with a guy and two girls this time rather than vice versa. Some people are immediatly turned off to that due to the popularity of love quarrels and fights of the heart...but it didn't bother me too much.<br /><br />Overall, this series is a great read. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is worth the time and money to go out and buy/support the author.
B003Y5H574|1.0|I had high expectations for this movie, but it ended up being a major failure. It was also boring. Seeing boring and Steve Carell in the same sentence is not something you see everyday. He has a proven track record of enjoyable movies such as The 40 Year Old Virgin, Over The Hedge, Little Miss Sunshine, Dan In Real Life, Get Smart, Evan Almighty, Horton Hears A Who!, Despicable Me, and Dinner For Schmucks. I was expecting this movie to be on that same level. But it failed to accomplish that. The speech during the graduation by Cal (Carell) seemed forced and awkward. Other than that, Carell's performance wasn't bad. But his best dramedy character is Dan Burns in the movie Dan In Real Life. Julianne Moore's character is easily forgettable. For a memorable Julianne Moore character, check out Freedomland. Emma Stone is also a forgettable character here. Ryan Goseling is the latest one to strike while the iron is hot, being in 3 awful or easy to forget movies that came out in 2011. Those movies being this, Drive, and The Ides Of March. Goseling gets somewhat of a pass because he's in Remember The Titans and I like that movie. I love Marissa Tomei and I was disappointed that her role was a bit part. She's clearly the stand out character of this movie. Kevin Bacon as the romantic antagonist David Lindhagen, is rather light weight. He's not sinister enough in his role. The whole boy and baby sitter subplot was really awkward and creepy. His public displays of love were way over the top, the babysitter's crush on Cal is creepy, the pics the babysitter sends Cal are creepy, and the boy's speech is very unrealistic. And to ask the same question another reviewer asked: why does a 13 year old need a baby sitter? I could see him needing a baby sitter if he were 10. But not at 13. Nothing but a stupid incoherent plot point. The title of this movie is only 1/3 accurate, with that 1/3 being STUPID!
0385738765|3.0|The Scortch Trials definitely gets you going right where you left off in the Maze Runner. Back to Thomas and how he is trying to figure out WICKED's true intentions/nature. Once again, there are many things that you have to open your mind to. (TRYING TO NOT SPOIL HERE) Flying liquid metal that can possibly suffocate you and make your head look like a bowling ball...was kinda new to me and didn't really fit in what I felt the Maze provided. There were many useless situations but I can see how the author was using these to try and twist and turn your mind into thinking of how Thomas and the rest of the gang were to escape. It adds a series of new characters...some given names...many not. I did feel, like the other reviewers, that Thomas not learning peoples names seemed a bit off. At the same time, I can see small sub groups in the large group being formed as in \\"normal\\" social circles. It was just weird that there were no more \\"alpha\\" members that would try to argue for leadership but rather many would just go with the flow of the \\"leaders\\".<br /><br />Personal Note: I dislike Theresa's character. I understand she is a main character but ever since the beginning of the maze runner, when she first appears...I just never liked her character. I don't know if the author wants us to question her or feel sorry for her...but the way that I picture/portray her is just as a very poor character. (semi spoiler here) Though I do find it weird of her martial arts abilities<br /><br />Overall - Get the book and read through right to the Death Cure. It is worth the read and does give you some insight on WICKED. This was my least favorite of the three but it doesn't make it a bad book<br /><br />GreggCas
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Fearless is not just a book about a Navy SEAL, though it would be a fantastic, adventurous read if it were. It's not just a book about faith, though it would be worth reading from that standpoint alone. And it's not simply a book about redemption, though it will make anyone believe that almost anything is possible, despite whatever horrific mistakes they've made in their lives. Fearless is all of these things, and it's simply one of the best nonfiction books I've ever read. Eric Blehm has done a phenomenal job of weaving the successes and failures of Adam Brown's life together into a coherent and very moving story. It will inspire and change the lives of many, if not most, who read it. It made me want to be a better husband, father, and son...and that's more than I had any right to expect from a book. Well done, Eric!
B008BRC5SY|5.0|The 1st greatest hits collection from Singer, Actress, Former American Idol Judge is a must have for any fan! Jennifer Lopez has come a long way and this album is truly a great acomplishment.<br /><br />The two new tracks Dance Again (Feat. Pitbull) and Goin' In (Feat. Flo Rida & Lil Jon) are stellar additions to an already amazing tracklist. They open up the album and show listeners Lopez can still get a club grooving and shaking! I'm Into You the second single off of her last album \\"Love?\\" is another nice addition, not as big a hit (Due to bad marketing and stalled radio airplay) but still a very catchy song! Followed by \\"Love?\\"'s lead single On The Floor which is another club hit and her highest charting song in a long time. J.Lo takes it back to 2001 with Love Dont Cost A Thing a personal favorite. Jennifer follows up with her 1st ever single and 1st number one If You Had My Love and also her iconic Waiting For Tonight which grew ever so popular in 1999. Get Right is the next hit from her 2005 album \\"Rebirth\\" and followed by Jenny From The Block and the irresitble I'm Real Murder Remix both J.Lo's best Hip Hop/R&B hits. From her flop album \\"Brave\\" Lopez salvaged the hit Do It Well and ends with the Hip Hop and heavy rap song Aint It Funny Murder Remix and the feel good track from her debut album Feelin' So Good.<br /><br />Overall the album will satisfy old and new fans alike, J.Lo proves why she has become one of the highest selling artists ever`
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Just awesome. Few movies like this make you realize that love can do anything. Love is the power that is present everywhere. John Nash's wife believed in love; she always supported him. That's true love.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book is as interesting as Harry Potter, but it is much more mature and clever.  The main character (Kvothe) is a perfect hero and his personality and demeanor were crafted brilliantly.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Beautifully written. It's the kind of book that lingers in your mind long after you finish it. It left me wanting to know more about the author because it felt like a memoir. He tells you a lot but leaves you wanting more. I want to read a lot more by this author.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Iz's music is from heaven!  It is a cure for insomnia!  I turn it on over and over if I cannot sleep and pretty soon it is daylight!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|The first thing you need to know about 999 is that it's very text heavy. It's more like an illustrated novel. There are a lot of story scenes which require a lot of reading, but the writing is very good with lots of descriptive language. The puzzle sections can be very difficult, but my favorite part of this game is that you can get different endings. Without spoiling too much, I'll just say that you can only travel in groups of 3-5 people. The game lets you pick which people you want and where you want to go. I've nearly completed the game, and I feel like I've played about 30-40 percent of it.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the quality, I'm a seventeen year old girl with a 4.0 who enjoys reading Stephen King books. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being a kid getting hit in the face with a pillow and 10 being a weasel eating its way out of someone's body and proceeding to chew other people's faces off, this game was a 7 or 8. The plot twists were sometimes a bit predictable, and some of the \\"science\\" is utterly preposterous, but I was able to get past them. The story itself affected me on an emotional level. I actually cried when a character died. (That's not a spoiler. How could there be blood and violence if everyone lived?)<br /><br />On the downside, it's not much of a logic game. There are logic puzzles, but you spend maybe half the game dealing with those. It's mainly combining objects to achieve a goal. Like putting all the pieces of a puzzle back together or finding keys in odd places. Though a lot of the puzzles were simple, the game itself was intense enough to keep my mind fully focused on the story. To my relief, you don't need a walkthrough to finish the game. (I'm not quite done, but I'm pretty sure there are only a few more puzzles). The puzzles are difficult, but not impossible. Only 10 or so areas of each room can be searched, and upon repeated failures, the other characters will give you hints, so even those of us who can be extremely dense at times won't miss things.<br /><br />This is a pretty rambling review, but I'm still caught up in the game, so I wanted to give you an accurate idea of my feelings. One thing that I want to say is that the beginning is NOT an accurate reflection of the rest of the game. The tutorial is almost painful to go through, but the rest of 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors is FAR better.
B004QL7K70|1.0|Dumb, noncreative stereotypes, no story, no acting, no nothing (double negative?). However, if you're an insecure rejected teen this will continue your fantasy stardom and provide the slapstick humor you never grew out of. The usual studio teen themes of alcohol, drugs, hot tubs (or pool), a few boobs and pretend sex, trashing - it's all comic book there.<br /><br />Four/five star reviewers came from the aforementioned demographic.<br />Three star reviewers safely indecisive.<br /><br />Kudos to the studio & producers for the latest tactic to squeeze more blood (money) to not include Special Features unless you pay extra.<br />Kudos to the studio & producers for the unimaginative copycatting of the too often used and cheap actor with handheld camera documenting vehicle.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is fun. I like that as you start off its easy but then as you advance it gets harder. I would recommend it!
0345803485|5.0|I am glad that I put aside the prejudice and ignorance of all the people that did not read FIFTY SHADES OF GREY ,but nevertheless had an opinion about and against the \\"scandalous\\" book, and bought me a copy.<br />To all the readers out there that are holding back I have one thing to say : \\" He who flees the behive in fear of the bee is not worthy of tasting the honey\\". Put your pre conceived opinion aside and read it... you are in for a treat.<br />Thomas Hardy, one of my favorite writters was highly chastesized by society when he wrote \\"Judas the Obscure\\", and what an amazing book that is.<br />E.L James you are amazing...please keep the great work, kudos to you!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great mahjong style puzzle game, love it on my phone and transformer tablet.  Not a huge fan of some of the tilesets, though, the Greek one in particular.
B000005J48|5.0|Not really going to spend much time reviewing except to say that there are but 12 copies left of this CD and that if you like Piazzolla and appreciate what Gidon Kremer does as a performer and arranger, well, this is the 'mas macho' CD of all.  The music selected is some of Piazzola's best,and the performances, what can I say?  Superlative, not only Gidon but clarinet and bandoneon stand out as does the whole ensemble. And, and well, you get an excellent, audiophile caliber recording to boot.  Don't walk, 'corre, corre!' [[ASIN:B000005J48 Hommage A Piazzolla]]
1400069289|3.0|I can say that book is a mix of magazine articles with a real prose full of drama and boring and rehearsing stories. Stories in a book are real life examples including modern history (2009). Examples specifically connected to behavior changes are not deep enough and require much more to be involved from cognitive science to succeed.  In short book ideas are: 1. Habit circle. 2. Use habit circle to instill effective behavior. 3. Supervision and leading idea are necessary to help habit change. 4. To instill new but different habit interchange it with habits/ideas sound familiar. 5. Instinct / subconscious behavior is habit circle based.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it wont let you search for music you cant even search I shoudvle never got this app no wonder its free!!!!! this is horrible never get this app&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!
034580404X|5.0|Was thrilled to find the trilogy so much cheaper then buying it at my favorite book store!  Had heard about the books, and bought them out of morbid curiousity.  Slightly \\"over the top\\"?  YES!  But, we all need to lose ourselves in a book sometimes.  Loved, loved, loved them!  Finished all 3 books within a week! Fell in love with Christian and Anastasia .. even with his Fifty Shades of Messed Up!  So worth the money!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love how easy to use this calculator is! The picture is also crystal clear. I absolutly love this app.
B0089IGUKO|5.0|This album is just so great and any music fan should have this. Another great album by The Gaslight Anthem, but when have they even made a bad album. Honestly, this is what I think of when i hear New Jersey and that is the best thing possible for such a great state.
B005LAIGLE|4.0|This has a great story line and I enjoyed it.  I, however, didn't feel like it needed as much profanity as it did.  There was so much that when I watched it the second time, I actually counted the F words -- 147 in addition to approximately 30 more obscenities.  We're not prudes by no means, but my husband actually was turned off by it and refused to watch it a second time.  I know it was meant to set the scene of the dark and seedy world of drug smuggling, but c'mon.
B004QL7K6Q|2.0|The blue ray is fine but the regular DVD wasn't included. The whole reason I bought it was for both and I only got the one. Little disappointing.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it was awesome and very addictable its awesome iiiiii lloooooovvvvveeeee iiiiiitttttt.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it sooooooooo much that I cant stop saying it.:) &lt;3
B008BM9L72|2.0|EL James has created a stock standard romance with BDSM for the interest of our porn-obsessed society. It is not particularly well written and totally unrealistic in terms of the sexual prowess of both main characters.<br />In the end, I was skipping over the endless and repetitive sex to find the next piece of plot or dialogue. I know, what an old fuddy-duddy.<br />Buy this if you like the standard fantasy of troubled and handsome rich man needing the love of a virginal beauty who is unaware of just how attractive she is. However steer clear if the trappings of the BDSM scene trouble you, as they are here in plenty.
B00049QQHI|5.0|I watched this movie years ago and I couldn't think of the name. It came on television and I thought I would order it and add to to my movie collection.
B0014J89JA|1.0|Ordered this it came in and would not play. It was in UK region codes.  Shipped this item as a gift ignorent to the fact it was coded for the UK region.
B007FEZQF8|3.0|I thought I would be able to read this on my iPhone and PC.  I can't believe it wont at LEAST work on PC...trying to make us give in and buy a Kindle?  Should have bought the Comixology one I guess or ordered the book.  This review DOES merit a 3 because of this, you look around carefully there's a dropdown that reveals that it's only on Android & Kindle but it was not up front for me to see that and geez you would ASSUME something this popular would be on all formats.
B00007LTIC|5.0|As I sit here listening to \\"Turn of the Century,\\" I have tears in my eyes. What a beautifully well written masterpiece, one of two on this progressive rock classic. This album featured the return of the \\"Fragile\\" Yes, and the end of the over the top \\"Tales\\" and \\"Relayer\\" Yes. I prefer the latter, but this album pleases both camps of Yes Fandom. \\"Going For The One,\\" \\"Parallels\\" and \\"Wonderous Stories,\\" are for the fans of the shorter easier to digest Yes. \\"Parallels\\" was the opener for the concerts when I saw them back to back in Cleavland and Buffalo in the summer of '77. It is one of the most rocking songs that Yes does and Chris and Alan shine.<br /><br />\\"Awaken\\" is the real gem of this album and one of the best songs of the progressive rock era. It is what progressive rock is all about, classical in nature but in essence its just rock music played by some talented musicians. Some people think that these kinds of songs are what killed the progressive rock era in the seventies. I disagree, it was when bands went the other way that they lost the audience of the true fans.<br /><br />The fans of the \\"hot\\" single or album won't be going to shows and buying albums decades later. 90% of the fans at a Yes show today would rather hear \\"Awaken\\" than \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart.\\" Progressive rock died when progressive bands started putting out albums like \\"Tormato,\\" and \\"Giant For a Day.\\" They were losing the audience they already had to go after one they were never going to get.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of the best albums of the Progressive rock era and should be in every classic rock fans collection. 5 stars for a true seventies classic by the best Progressive Rock band ever. The key word here being rock: Chris Squire, Steve Howe, and Alan White, make a hell of a power trio. Rick Wakeman who along with Keith Emerson were the best keyboardist of the era and Jon Anderson vocals have no equal. Buy it and be Awakened.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|While this series is NOT for everyone(some of the reviews don't emphasize it enough), I thought it was excellent! I believe that the plot is well written and I think that we all can relate a little to Ana and Christian. The second book of the trilogy I found to be a little less intense than the first(at least a little bit less graphic). I would recommend this to my friends, but I would also be understanding that the book(s) are a little intense and graphic at times.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I get into these moods for something dark and this book definitely was the fix I was looking for. If you like dark and moody reads this is one for you to try. I will look for more from this author.
160059672X|5.0|This book is a font of creativity and ideas.  It is also very well diagrammed so that, with practice, anyone can follow along.  I've enjoyed it immensely.  Great seller. Quick ship.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|I keep redownloading it and still does not work . I did it like 10 times and it takes forever to download
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What the heck did I just read? How did this even become a best seller? This crap book doesn't even deserve a 1 star. It deserves a -5 star.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Even after reading all the reviews...I went ahead and bought this compilation of outtakes.... as that what it seems to be to me. Boring to the max. The author should be ashamed...reminds me of Frank herbert's son and the Dune series...should not have been published. Searching Google, I found out there are websites to download this book (and the next) in a pdf format...for free. Glad I did. The next book, A Dance with Dragons, stinks worse than this one...and they want $14.99 for it! Save your hard earned money folks and believe these reviews,
034580404X|4.0|The product was delivered faster than promised and the books were in great shape. The story line is a little confussing at first but developes as you get into the second and third books. Read all 3 in 7 days because I could not put them down.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app. i use it for keeping inventory of supplies, making shopping lists, taking notes for ideas i want to remember.  i like that you can edit the notes from your phone or online or desktop client and it all syncs together.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a game I play constintly. I would reccomend this to people who would like to work on hand-eye coordination.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Pretty good app. It would be nice to see which pieces are taken but that's a small quibble. Good computer opponent with difficultly selection.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Even if you are not a fan of the original Sherlock Holmes, if you like mind-twisting puzzles and great writing and acting, these are the stories for you! Benedict and Martin bring their best game to these roles, and the stories themselves are superb! DO enjoy Season One first; then these 3 gems will shine even more brightly.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is really good, I wish it didn't skip over some of the important parts but I still enjoyed ir, the author does get repetitious at times but I like that this feels like a book I can relate to and understand myself, as a girl of Ana's age.  I would read all three again and any other books that continue the story
B004132HZS|5.0|Watched first episode on Netflix, just to see how badly they could screw up putting Shelock Holmes in modern day setting.  WRONG!  Totally blown away by the effort.  The original stories are well adapted to today's environment and the casting is perfect.  Had to purchase season one and two on DVD.  The BBC's treatment of TV drama seems slow and drawn out at first, but it really pulls one into the story and time passes surprisingly fast.  Foyle's War is another BBC show that we got hooked on as well.  Each episode is over one and a half hours long (no commercials) for both series and so well done. Have not watched Sherlock Season Two as yet, but expect the same quality production.  If one enjoys Sherlock Holmes this would be a pleasant experience.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three books, they were amazing! Definitely something to keep your interest. It's a sexy provocative book turned amazing love story with some kinky twists in the mix still! I hope E.L decides to write more because I will without doubt read more about this story! You fall in love with Ana and Christian! Would read it a million times over!!! A MUST READ!
0385528752|4.0|This book has some new and exciting ideas. It would be challenging to implement. It is food for thought. If you are serving in any kind of leadership role, this is a great book to read.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was amazed at how easy it was to download it to my iPad. I was able to download the kindle for free and now I can read this book wherever I go, whether I have service or not. I recommend this book to all the ladies!!

1440503257|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I selected this book to review, but what I got was a very nice collection of recipes that are meant to represent the dishes and treats mentioned in the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />Each recipe includes a specific reference to the book and chapter. Since this is an unofficial cookbook, the recipe titles themselves don't always match the names used in the books, but one can get a sense of connection from the descriptions of the dishes.<br /><br />The book is designed to give the appearance of an older book: page edges are untrimmed, the paper includes \\"shading\\" to give the appearance of parchment, and the ink is sepia, rather than black.  There are NO illustrations at all, but there are some interesting \\"sidebars.\\"  The recipes themselves are fairly standard British-food type recipes, recipes that you might find in any good British cookbook. They've been \\"edited\\" for U.S. cooks in terms of measurements and ingredients, and most appear to be reasonably easy to prepare, although some of the instructions seem overly complex.<br /><br />Of the recipes I've made (probably 6 or 8 in all), my favorites are \\"Herby Roast Chicken with Onion-Garlic Mashed Potatoes\\" (from \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\\" Chapter 9) and \\"Rhubard Crumble with Custard Sauce\\" (from \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\\" Chapter 5). These are good solid recipes that produce good results.<br /><br />The problem is, I have several good British cookbooks that contain similar recipes, and that also include illustrations. The only thing this book has over those is the unofficial Harry Potter connection.<br /><br />This book is a cute novelty item for die-hard Harry Potter fans, and might even serve to introduce a whole new generation to British food (it's not ALL over cooked soggy peas and non-descript meat). The recipes seem to be good representatives of that country's cuisine. But if you already have a couple of good British cookbooks in your collection, and you don't really care about the Harry Potter connection, you probably won't find much new here.ion, and you don't really care about the Harry Potter connection, you probably won't find much new here.
1449389627|5.0|The Myths of Innovation - written by Scott Berkun has completely challenged my closed mind regarding what I thought I knew about innovation and inventors. I came into the book knowing that Scott is one of my authors; however, the topic of innovation and the well-researched book has once again far exceeded my expectations. In ten short chapters, many of the preconceived myths of innovation such as - history of innovation, the best ideas win, innovation always is good, and the lone inventor fallacy are blown to smithereens. Scott clears out the nonsense and grandiose stories that have been passed on by many regarding innovation and gets down to the truth of the driving factors of innovation. I could honestly say that a whole generation of innovators could be grown if this book is mandatory reading in public schools.<br /><br />A few highlights that will stay with me are:<br /><br />Divinchi's quote - \\"Stand still and watch the patterns, which by pure chance have been generated: Stains on the wall, or the ashes in a fireplace, or the clouds in the sky, or the gravel on the beach or other things. If you look at them carefully you might discover miraculous inventions.\\"<br /><br />Inventors with hard work and ideas from others take thoughts and put them together into a finished puzzle - for instance, the cell phone is a culmination of various technologies.<br /><br />Many variables going on during an invention - for instance what would have happened if IBM bought Apple in the beginning? Steve Jobs offered it to them in the early stages.<br /><br />History is romanticized by those who interpreted it and there is no objective history.<br /><br />Page 91 - To brainstorm correctly you need to have three things: facts, ideas, and solutions. And you need to spend quality time in each section.<br /><br />Page 132 - Pick the right problem to solve and defining them correctly - remember the palm pilot objectives  - Fits in shirt pocket, syncs seamlessly with PC, fast and easy to use, and no more than $299.<br /><br />Page 146 - Software that rewards people for slowing down and thinking about what they're reading and writing might be the greatest innovation of all time<br /><br />The interesting factors of why the United States is one of the few countries on the English standard and not metric...just has not caught on.<br /><br />This book will remain in my book shelf again and Scott is becoming one of my favorite authors due to his out of the box thinking; I highly recommend this book to all and if possible purchase his other books or visit his website [...]ewards people for slowing down and thinking about what they're reading and writing might be the greatest innovation of all time    The interesting factors of why the United States is one of the few countries on the English standard and not metric...just has not caught on.    This book will remain in my book shelf again and Scott is becoming one of my favorite authors due to his out of the box thinking; I highly recommend this book to all and if possible purchase his other books or visit his website [...]
B008COD5UI|5.0|Great buying everything from Amazon. They make buying online a lot easier. They will put all big chain stores out of business.  Movie was excellent. Recommend this movie for sure.
0307716546|3.0|I found the writing style too hard to process and the story didn't work for me because of a combination of it felt too contrived, too gimmicky, I didn't like the out-of-body narration factor, and I didn't feel connected to the characters.  I was really surprised considering how much I liked her first novel so I will still check out her next one.

When you finish, you may feel it all seems simple; and in many respects, it is. That's the beauty of the book; everything is straightforward and common sense. Short and to the point. Mike has an accompanying web site with all sorts of additional into, including his specific recommendations for supplements to help you achieve your goals.

B00092ZL80|5.0|Like others have said, if you like either/or both of these bands (as I do) you are going to enjoy this concert. And as one reviewer said, the beginning songs and the end songs where both bands are on stage together are worth the price of this dvd. This is the rare concert that I will definitely watch again which makes it an even more valuable purchase. You get a lot for your dollar in just the many various styles from rockin' to softer to downright funky with some improvisational thrown in on \\"Shining Star\\". You won't be sorry for the purchase!
B00594XOZU|1.0|The kik messenger app is dangerous. It is simply a forum for sexting and other extremely inappropriate texting. I believe it is a haven for pedophiles. Not worthy to be rated even one star.
2020418800|5.0|This book was always checked out of the local library by my son.  So, for his birthday I decided to get a copy of it for him to keep.  He loved it and now he wants to keep reading.  Thank you, it was in great condition and worth the money spent.
1439152799|4.0|Kate has produced another heat book that takes you back and forth between the past and present.  A book full of well designed characters and plot that allows a reader of any age to enjoy this book.  It has been passed between readers in their 20s to readers in their 70s and all have enjoyed
B004UNX1LS|2.0|This app is pretty good if you want to listen to SOME of your favorite songs.And that's just the problem. SOME of your favorite songs.  I constantly found myself looking for a song I really liked but coming up empty handed. it seems like they have a lot of new songs by new artists that no one knows about but not enough oldish songs by artists that are actually known. For example I was looking for this one song by Justin Biebier. And let me just say I am not one of those crazied fans,  I just really like this song. The song is not even that old but just what? they don't have it.  Besides that problem it seem that I'm always having to force close it because of some kind of error or something. There are even time when it freezes and the screen goes black. so then I have to shut my kindle off because I can't exit the app. That starts to get really annoying after a while. Lastly, aometimes when I click a video I go onto it and all around the edges are staticy any blue. if it happens to one vidoeo the rest of them are going to be like that. closing the app won't help either. I have to shut my kindle off and turn it back on for it to get fixed. The only reason I gave this app a 3 is because I like to lozenge to music when I sleep so I just set a up a long play list of songs, plug earphones in,  and go to sleep.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|I listen to 'Manners' all the way through almost every day at work.  If you haven't listened to the entire album yet, do yourself a favor and go buy it.<br /><br />Passion Pit knocked it out of the park with their new album.  I just listened to it all the way through and I can gladly say that it has the same sound that we all know and love.<br /><br />Is there anything more to say?<br /><br />You want a real treat?  See them in concert!

B000FC146C|5.0|A great story from beginning to end. It caught the reader's interest immediately and held it through the<br />whole story. It speaks about family, the Church and many other familiar topics beautifully interwoven for a<br />terrific story.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|I can't really go into specifics on blu rays.  Im not an expert on visual or audio quality.  What I can say is that the quality of both of these was fantastic, in my opinion, considering when this movie came out.  This is one of the best movies ever to come out so it's only fitting that it gets a proper blu ray treatment.  For me it definitely got that.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. It keeps appraised of the weather 24 hours a day. I can trust the information it gives me.
0345803485|2.0|I will admit- I jumped on the bandwagon and read this book... I felt as though I needed to understand what all the fuss is about. As I read the last sentence of this book, I thought, REALLY??! That is IT?! Mid-way through the book, I was thoroughly bored of the sex scenes, and as others mentioned, the extremely repetitive language of the book. Words like 'cocked', 'impassively', etc. are sprinkled repetitiously throughout the book, which I started to believe was a far too obvious and unnecessary attempt at creating sexual overtones. The chemistry between the characters never made sense to me: Mr. Grey is a hot, billionaire with a peculiar sexual appetite that virtually NO ONE could keep up with, much less a 21-year old virgin girl, who the author painted as plain-looking, somewhat dorky, awkward, clumsy, prude-ish, self-deprecating, etc. Despite their extreme differences in looks, economic statuses and personalities, Mr. Grey is immediately (and unrealistically) drawn to Ana... he therefore pursues her like any creepy stalker would, locating her via the latest technological devices and showing up to wherever she is- LIKE A CREEPY STALKER DOES. This behavior would trigger ANY normal human being to run for the hills, call the police, etc., but not Ana...she ignores the creepy stalker red flags and is drawn to him like a moth to a flame. Fiction or not, the author failed miserably at making these characters and their personalities realistic and believable... this and their nonsensical attraction to each other completely turned me off to this book (the irony is not lost on me). If you HAVE to read this book, do yourself a favor and BORROW it from someone- don't waste your money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I Couldnt put it down! I read all three in less than two Weeks! Definately will recommend to my friends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book!! Glad i downloaded it to my iphone so that i am able to take it everywhere with me 8~)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great app. Very addictive and fun to play. Only problem is sometimes it is easy to touch a path you've already made correctly and then when you redo it. it counts as another try.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book. I think it was better than the first one! Can't wait to read the third one.  There was such an awesome ending that made you want to jump right into the third book.
1416550534|5.0|I had spent last summer reading Kate Morton's The Forgotten Garden, and loved it.  Even though I wanted to wait longer to read another of her books (as there are not yet that many) - I could not, so I started reading The House at Riverton.  Wow. Yet again, wow.<br /><br />At first I was quite sure I was not going to like The House at Riverton as much as her other novel.  It started more slowly. The current day moments were not as interesting - at first - as the recollections of the stories from the early 1900s.  But that changed, and quickly. About half way through the book it grabbed me and completely swept me up in its journey. I loved the characters, older at this point, - Grace and the two sisters, Hannah and Emmeline. As their situations got more grown up, I found myself becoming more entertained. By the time it was the roaring '20s, I was enchanted. I never wanted this story to end, and I have to admit I was sad when it did, inevitable though it may be.<br /><br />I loved Grace as the narrator/center of this story. She was perfect, so filled with a sense of bittersweet.  I knew Kate Morton knew how to set a scene you can live in, but it appears she truly knows how to create good characters as well. The mix of family, secrets, tension, love, and friendship were so wonderfully mixed. I felt as if I was living along with them, seeing everything firsthand. Taking the journey along with these girls, and even more so, wanting to be a part of their world.<br /><br />I can't possibly give this less than 5 stars, although I debated because of the slower start - but it really is that good. I can't wait to read Morton's other novel, and it looks like one will be coming out this autumn. I would encouragingly recommend these books. She's a true talent, and The House at Riverton definitely lives up.
0345803485|1.0|I have an advanced degree in English Literature. I read this book on a lark since many people I know are reading it. I have only one question: how did this get published? Does the author have naked pictures of her publisher? The characters are one-dimensional. Their dialogue is unrealistic  for young people, the situations are laughable, and their conversations and emotional reactions are repetitive and tiresome. This doesn't come close to real erotica. I am baffled that one book was published, much less three. I heard this may become a movie. If it does, they should hire Kristen Stewart and Rob Pattinson. There isn't much acting ability required above broodiness and whining, and they have it nailed down. Truly awful stuff here. Let's hope the \\"author\\" gets another day job. If anyone is interested in reading real erotica by a real author check out Anne Rice writing as A.N. Roquelaure in the \\"Beauty\\" series.
B007SGM084|4.0|I read the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy and they were great.  Would read additional books by this author.  I purchased the books from Amazon.com for reading on my Kindle, it was easy and fast.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|entertaining and challenging...u never know what the next game will entail..helps pass the time super fast and keeps u on your toes..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Though simple, this game is well thought out and enjoyable.  It grows in difficulty at a comfortable pace.  I highly reccommend it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is an incredible story of one man's life in the SEALs and how he got there after a life of drugs and crime.  He was fearless and a savior to his SEAL Team(s).  I was shocked to find out how much training (and ongoing throughout their SEAL career) these teams endure.  This is not just your ordinary military workout! Very good lessons in strength, endurance, loyalty, love of family, and going against all odds.  In the end - a tear jerker.
0375842209|5.0|The best book I've read this year, if not the best book I've ever read. I'd elevate my star scale simply to give this a 6 and then retire 6s.<br /><br />There's nothing more exhilarating than reading a book destined to be a classic. Narrated by death, the story of Liesel is powerful. When Liesel witnesses her brother's death, her book thievery begins. In a world no child should have to understand, books represent her struggle to survive.<br /><br />Do you ever get a song stuck in your head? You can be in the grocery store unable to shake its melodic grip on your brain. After humming it for days, you try to listen to other music to shake it. You can't. That is The Book Thief.<br /><br />I'm struggling to summarize the brilliance and intricacy of this story. Every word has meaning and does its part to create unforgettable characters and storyline. Throughout, Death talks about the job of delivering souls during World War II. From the back cover: Death has never been busier and will become busier still.<br /><br />Death notices Liesel pick up her first stolen book: The Grave Digger's Handbook. Normally averse to knowing people's stories, Death can't help but become connected to Liesel. He sees her many more times as he picks up other souls.<br /><br />When her foster father's commitment to a past war buddy results in the family hiding a Jew in their basement, Liesel's life will never be the same. Max bonds with the girl through stories and pictures. Ultimately, he must leave and Liesel faces another loss. She will have to face many more.<br /><br />This story will hold your heart prisoner. It haunted my dreams at night, and I know Liesel and her story will stay with me. I've given 5 stars before, but never have I so fully believed a book should be read before now. This needs to be in classrooms, on bookshelves, and in people's minds.<br /><br />I couldn't agree more with the sentence from Amazon: This is an unforgettable story about the ability of books to feed the soul.l.
0142418471|4.0|Amazing book over all. Book itself was in new condition and i don't think i could've been happier with my purchase.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very fun and addicting. I got it on my ipod touch and my sisters ipad. it can get hard sometimes but it is so fun
B006TLFPKO|2.0|I should have listened to all of those who read the book and said how disappointed and pissed they were and should've never watched the movie. Despite of all the warnings, I still went ahead and watched it, I guess because of all the anticipation.  Let me start by saying, Breaking Dawn was a disappointment in so many levels. The reason I fell in love with the series was because it was so romantic and magical...there was not much of that in Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />I'm just pissed with how much Edward and Bella changed, the wedding, the honeymoon, the pregnancy (according to Meyer this could not happen).  Thanks Stephanie Meyer for killing all my imagined magic this Sage might once held for me...<br /><br />The baby's name: Renesmee!!  And then Jacob imprinting on her. I felt sick.<br /><br />I have never been so let down by a movie. This was a total betrayal of the series.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is one of the best games I have ever gotten I absolutely love it!!! best game Eva!!! love it!!!!!
B00005JLIU|5.0|I have always been a Julie Andrews fan. She had such a pure and versatile voice. Mary Tyler Moore was at her hay day and made a great addition to this movie.  No doubt about the talents and energy that both Carol Channing and James Fox brought to this production. The music and lyrics added to this fun spirited plot. I purchased this when released in VHS and just had to add it to my DVD classic movie collection.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This does what it says. But it can be a little buggy at times. There also seems to be no way to get rid of ads. A con to me. Overall, I do like the app. But it does need to have some improvements. Hopefully the updates comes.
B001O8C5EQ|4.0|This CD is very good, but does not enter the list of my most favorite band. There is good rock music and a well made as much of the repertoire of Porcupine Tree. It is hard to find anything bad done by this band, but do not recommend as dsico debut for the work is more introspective. Fans of Porcupine Tree can not fail to have it especially this version with bonus disc that features demos of the time. Note that I would give this book perhaps between 8 and 9 and there are many fans who choose the best album of the band. Very good!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|There is not much that I can add to a review that hasn't already been said. This story is a wonderful dark epic. There is no HEA here, the ending is a self contained adventure but is open ended for book 2. Lord I hope to see book 2 one day. Anthoney's story is as great as Patrick Rothfuss' The Name of the Wind. It made me laugh, smile, cringe, and cry. I love the story. It's so good I ready it twice in a week. How many books can you say that about? I have already reccomended it to a few friends. If you still need help making up your mind about reading this just read the sample. I bet you can't make it through the sample without the feeing that something BIG and BAD is going to happen.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!! So addicting and fun! I also like how there are objectives to beat and coins to collect and buy stuff with. And the greatest part- ITS FREE!!! &#9733; &hearts;
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this game and have been playing it every day since I got it. The only thing I wish it had is more puzzles.  But I have been having fun trying to get 3 stars on each puzzle that it has.
0345535421|2.0|(Spoilers) Having watched the HBO show of the Game of Thrones, I wanted to experience the books. I thought Game of Thrones was a very good story with compelling characters. Clash of Kings is very dark book.  I have a particular issue with GRRM's continued plotline of children being brutally killed.  The authors descriptions of the events is quite disturbing and had to put the book down.<br /><br />Alot of the characters act irrationally and unbelievable as the story goes along.  Particurly the fate of Jaime Lannister. Not believable at all considering his family murdered her husband and was holding her daughters hostage.<br /><br />This book gets compared to LOTR. I agree that LOTR was too fairly tale with all of the main characters surviving despite numerous battles. Clash of Kings goes to the extreme in the other direction. There should have been happy medium for the Good Guys to win.<br /><br />Also missing thoughout Clash of Kings (unlike the tv show) is Robb Stark.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The program works perfectly. Really nice to be able to access my home pc from anywhere. A must own for any pc user.
B004ZEWP28|5.0|Buy, Listen, enjoy your journey.... If you're open-minded enough, you could experience an even better journey and a different one every time you listen to it. =) Not to boast or anything, but I'm definitely that open-minded/blessed!<br /><br />The secret law of attraction. Reap what you sow. If you dwell on what you don't want, you are telling the universe you want more of it. On the other hand, if you focus on what you DO want and imagine you already have it, actually FEELING how good you feel to have it, it will eventually be drawn to you. Even if you don't see any way it could happen.<br /><br />Namaste. =)
B005LAIGSM|3.0|Rachel McAdams is saddled with the toughest job in this movie, playing an amnesiac, and has difficulty pulling it off consistently. Channing Tatum's character is always actively attacking the problem so he has a range of emotion and plot points to navigate. McAdams has to be completely reactive for most of the film and spends all her time in confusion, frustration, discomfort, trepidation, and aggravation - none of which makes her character particularly engaging or appealing and all of which look pretty much the same on the screen.<br /><br />Yes, it makes her real. You squirm and fidget and get frustrated yourself while watching her - just like Tatum's character does - and that's exactly the effect the film wants to achieve. It deserves applause for achieving it in large part. But that realistic touch is a hard sell in a film marketed as romantic fluff. Right or wrong, it's not what most audiences want to feel while watching it.<br /><br />It's funny reading reviews here by people who complain how selfish she is because she is frequently upset and isn't cheerfully embracing all the wonderful things her husband is trying to do for her. Um, HE'S A COMPLETE STRANGER TO HER. I think they figure, \\"But it's Channing Tatum!\\" Okay.<br /><br />The worst bits are her controlling rich parents and the smarmy rich ex-fiance. They are two-dimensional cardboard characters straight out every mediocre movie ever made.

B004LWZWGA|5.0|To state that Christopher Nolan's crescendo-building finale to the Dark Knight trilogy is richly plotted is a gross understatement. There is so much going on in the intricately detailed screenplay co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan that it's a wonder that he pulls it off with not only cinematic gusto but with surprising clarity. In fact, the artistic success of this epic 2012 adventure has primarily to do with Nolan's virtuosic filmmaking style which reflects an uncompromising level of commitment that stubbornly doesn't translate into the level of Cameron-level hubris you would expect from such a surefire studio rainmaker. In fact, as he showed most effectively in 2008's [[ASIN:B001OGWY1W The Dark Knight]], Nolan can take the most ludicrous material and invest it with so much belief and inflate it with unbounded imagination and intelligence, so much so that he can overcome any lingering skepticism (if not endless critical feedback) that belabors the incredulousness of the venture. Unlike 2010's [[ASIN:B0047WJ12K Inception]], where he does get carried away with the blinking creativity of its mind-altering concept, the well-grounded myth of Batman tethers him irrevocably to the fastidious demands of an established fan base of not only the 73-year-old comic books but of the movies themselves from the serials in the 1940's to the Tim Burton pictures to \\"The Dark Knight\\". He also has a firm grasp on the narrative from an emotional standpoint and can still stage a sharp albeit often far-fetched action scene.<br /><br />Although it's only been four years since the release of \\"The Dark Knight\\", the story has moved forward eight years since the pivotal moment when Batman disappeared after taking the blame for D.A. Harvey Dent's crimes in order to salvage the hope he represented to the populace in the wake of the Joker's rampage.  Those intervening years have been an extended period of quiet for Gotham City, but it's all based on a deception of misplaced heroism. Bruce Wayne's lifelong love Rachel Dawes was killed in a fiery explosion, and he has become a recluse in his manor under the delusion that she was leaving Dent for him. A clever jewel thief named Selina Kyle unexpectedly enters his life stealing his mother's pearls just as Wayne Enterprises begins to crumble due to Wayne's long-standing absence from the board.  He retreats from his decision to invest in board member Miranda Tate's clean energy, fusion power project after he learns that the core could be modified to become a nuclear weapon. At the same time, a brutalizing terrorist named Bane makes his debut in Gotham City attacking the stock exchange and forcing Wayne to liquidate his assets. Although the act appears initiated by the Machiavellian impulses of a rival board member, the ensuing revolution turns out to cut much deeper as a war against the wealthy with the entire city being held hostage and a deeply personal vendetta against Wayne that inevitably goes back to the story in the first film, 2005's [[ASIN:B0014D6PCO Batman Begins]].<br /><br />To give away any more would be sacrilegious. Suffice it to say the circumstances become dire leading to powerful images of devastation and visceral showdowns that don't disappoint. If anything, Nolan eschews much of the expected violence in favor of genuine suspense probably due to the pre-release speculation of rabid bloggers who were trying to guess how Nolan would wrap up all the storylines. Obviously if you have some idea of the original comic book storylines, you'll know where the plot is going. Regardless, Nolan has really figured out how to provide the film a climax that is ultimately satisfying. As both Wayne and Batman, Christian Bale proves that he is the actor who best understands the dichotomy of the mythically contrarian role, and in this film, reveals the vulnerability of a fallen public figure with the appropriate gravitas. Several other veteran actors are back for their third round and reveal more depthto their characters - Michael Caine conveying the burdensome weight of Alfred's melancholy while witnessing Wayne as he tortuously resuscitates his secret identity, Morgan Freeman erudite as ever as Wayne's armorer Lucius Fox, and an especially effective Gary Oldman, who as the world-weary Commissioner Gordon, agonizes over the guilt of his long-held secret about Batman and Dent. Even Cillian Murphy and Liam Neeson show up to reprise their previous roles as Dr. Jonathan Crane and Ra's al Ghul, respectively, in memorable cameos.<br /><br />Nolan also scooped up members of his \\"Inception\\" ensemble for key roles - a comparatively pallid Marion Cotillard as Wayne's benefactress and burgeoning love interest Tate, Joseph Gordon-Levitt showing more grit than before as police officer John Blake whose idealism remains unabated despite the grim circumstances, and Tom Hardy virtually unrecognizable as the menacing Bane, a deliberate contrast to the chaotic anarchy of Heath Ledger's well-missed Joker. In particular, Hardy sharply conveys the imposing physicality and florid pontification of a relentless terrorist leader, and he and Bale engage in a couple of hand-to-hand combat sequences that viscerally epitomize the good-versus-evil conundrum at the center of the story. The biggest surprise of the cast turns out to be Anne Hathaway who eschews her usually sunny screen persona with infectious abandon as Catwoman (although she is never referred by this moniker in the film). She not only captures her character's slinky amorality and acrobatic moves but also provides clear insight into Selina's nihilistic behavior with welcome economy. It's also her character who acts as a touchstone in announcing to Wayne the coming revolution, which has obvious parallels to the Occupy movement that has monopolized recent headlines. In fact, the one storytelling misstep may be an underlying presumption that an anti-Wall Street screed would automatically establish the moral tone of the film when I think more widespread evidence of such villainy is warranted versus the greed-driven acts of a single company's board.<br /><br />But let's not forget this is all based on a comic book, and on that level, it enthralls with impressive set pieces, state-of-the-art gadgetry (the high-flying \\"Bat\\" is cool), and thrilling action sequences beginning with an airplane dismantling sequence worthy of James Bond. I applaud Nolan for not being afraid to stage the group fight scenes with the deliberately superficial expedience of the original TV series. He also doesn't harp on any particular political agenda (despite what professional critics and rhetoric-crazed pundits may claim) and never forgets that balance in his cerebrally meticulous approach all the way through its 145-minute running time. Granted there are some moments of forced humor I could have done without. Regardless, this is one of the few occasions when I felt the movie was actually not long enough. As you would expect, the film's production values are superb from Wally Pfister's dark-hued cinematography (he also lensed the first two films) to Hans Zimmer's appropriately stentorian score to the outstanding production design by Nathan Crowley and Kevin Kavanaugh (Gotham City never looked more realistically like Manhattan) to the multitudes responsible for the special effects (the football game scene is a stunner even from the trailer).

B003TH41H4|5.0|I can't get enough of this amazing series, we MUST have more! You can't leave it this wide open! I couldn't take my eyes of this series as it unfolded into a masterpiece of mystery, action, adventure, romance, desperation and wonder! Even if your not a fan of this kind of thing, give it a shot, you will thank me later ;).
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I have read a huge number of fantasy books in the last few years.  I generally rely on reviews to narrow down my choices.  I especially like series.  This book was one of the best books I have read, it is that good.  It's complicated, interesting and different from any other supernatural book I have read so far. I won't describe the detail, since many already have, I would highly recommend this and the sequel, Shadow of Night, which was just released, which I just finished. These books are quite long, and the story evolves in an interesting way. This book is not only a great story, it is very well written.  I can't wait for the 3rd book!  I expect this author, Deborah Harkness, to write many more great books in the future.  It would make a great movie.  Enjoy!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a real page turner.  Very twisted relationship and keeps you guessing til the end.  I just read that they are turning it into a movie.  I highly recommend this book.

Every time I would rock the toy and it plays music they will laugh. The only down side for such a young babies is that the music/sounds very short and if you baby cant push the toy yet, I will be constuntly doing it. Overall love it. I hope to get more use of it when they start crawling.

0345803493|5.0|I really enjoyed all three books, more so for the love story than the sex scenes. Truthfully, the authour probably good have still had a best seller without them. I liked the premise of a broken man who through the power of love becomes a loving man. Can never go wrong with that type of storyline. I recommend all three books (I'm reading it for the second time, that's how much I enjoyed the story overall)and if you get tired of the sex scenes, just skip them and the story will still be enjoyable.

0345803485|4.0|Before I bought the kindle edition, my eyes went right to the comments.  I noticed all the low ratings, and was debating on if I really wanted to spend the time reading it.  But seeing that this was on New York Times Bestselling list, I had to give it a try!  I'm actually glad I did!  The book is fantasy....WAY FANTASY!  Christian is pretty much perfect and rich and handsome and...well...big.  Can this guy get any more perfect?  Honestly, it didn't sound like real life to me.  Looking past that, I really did enjoy the novel.  I'm not into erotic novels, and try to steer clear of them because its just not the kind of reading I'm into.  I thought the sex scenes were pretty tame though, or \\"vanilla.\\"  I would recommend this book for friends, and I do plan on reading the rest of the trilogy.  For those of you who are skeptical on reading the book, I say give it a try.  Who knows, you may like it!

I will see how much it costs to have it fixed locally and if that does not pan out I will just buy my husband a new watch...again.<br /><br />I did a lot of research before buying this. It could be just a fluke but I am disappointed.
B0054JURZA|4.0|I purchased this record over a year ago, and I have to say with some authority, this is a record you should certainly purchase.<br />Over the past year I have listened to this record constantly and have yet to grow tired of it. Though it is clearly not a record for everyone, if what Bon Iver does is your cup of tea then you will enjoy this.<br />The melodies here are gorgeous, the lyrics interesting and evocative, the production strong and full. Musically it sounds like the song from Bon Iver's debut writ large, with expansive and full instrumentation where there was once only a voice accompanied by guitar. In every way I believe this to be a stronger record than his debut.<br />Why four stars? Mostly because I personally do not dig \\"Wash\\", and that's really it. I also try to reserve five stars for records that stand the test of the time, and this one is too recent to really know yet.<br />But \\"Bon Iver\\" is a must purchase. With all the new music that has come out in the past year this is one of the records that I always keep coming back to. And there is no greater compliment I can think to give.

B004EPYZT4|2.0|I read the original Conan series after seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger muscling it up as the titular beefcake hero in multiple films. To my delight Conan was much more verbal and a lot less muscle-bound in Robert E. Howard's fiction. I can only assume that's what the producers were striving for when they decided to remake \\"Conan the Barbarian.\\"<br /><br />In so many ways, \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" is similar to \\"Immortals\\": naïve but violent young man (Leo Howard as young Conan) witnesses a parents' death (Ron Perlman as Corin), swears to avenge himself on the megalomaniac (Stephen Lang as Khalar Zym) responsible, stumbles across a beautiful yet chaste priestess (Rachenl Nichols as Tamara) who just happens to be the Chosen One that the megalomaniac is hunting, the villain manages to capture an artifact without her help anyway, and then in a final climactic battle the hero duels the madman over some precipice. If that's all there was to \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" it would be a passable if unremarkable film. But this is Conan the freaking Barbarian we're talking about, so that's not good enough.<br /><br />Things aren't helped by the fact that adult Conan doesn't appear on screen for the first 15 minutes; that Conan has no character development whatsoever (he's more interesting as a child than a man); that most violence seems to be less about slashing and instead clubbing people with swords so that special effects blood appear at random; and cliffs and forest terrain appear completely out of nowhere.<br /><br />\\"Conan\\" does get a few things right. Topless women abound. There's definitely a Lovecraftian feel to the Dweller, but after seeing the villain's men marching in uniform black armor accompanying a ship carried by elephants, it's hard not to make parallels to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" films. Because Conan never manages to really create a sense of place, it just seems like it ripped off other, better fantasy films.<br /><br />And that's a shame. Jason Momoa does a good job of making Conan more than muscles, although he has those in spades too. His spunky sidekick Tamara stands out in sharp contrast to the other Hyborean women, but she never does anything noteworthy enough to matter. Tamara's the same helpless princess in all the Conan stories, only now she juts out her lip and claims she's \\"no man's property.\\" Of all the characters, the only one of interest is Rose McGowan's Marique, managing to create a sexy/creepy villainess with incestuous undertones. SPOILER THE BARBARIAN: Marique uses her magic on a special effect that seems wasted (sand dwellers aren't the archetypical Conan monster I would have picked) and she suffers an ignominious death that's not worthy of the character, but that's note McGowan's fault.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" bears little resemblance to the books that inspired it. Although this version exhibits more brains the brawn, it's not enough. In an era where there are dozens of imitators spawned by the original film, \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" is muscled out by the competition.making Conan more than muscles, although he has those in spades too.

B001G0MFOM|1.0|Just hated almost everything about this season. Starting off the fact that it was only 8 episodes long. From the start I knew that meant it was a throw away season. The finale of season five would be a better ending than the last episodes of this season. I have a feeling that so little effort was put in this because it was more of springboard for \\"The Farm\\" which was never picked up then an actual ending to the series. Not even Lucy Lawless could save this great series. I would have loved to have her come on as a regular character and get involved with one of the characters. The whole point of her character being there did not even answer the question that was the basis for all 8 episodes of the series.

B008JH5CVS|4.0|Definitely worth the 4 stars! I have recently become addicted to a video in my \\"man cave\\" after a night shift/before bed. I thought I had exhausted the view-worthy selections in action/drama/sci-fi. This is one I over-looked. Did I buy it? No. Will I ?  No. Not anymore than I would buy a piece of great gum I had just recently chewed. LOL.  I don't mean to say this movie is simply fodder for the genre lover - it is more than that to be sure. The Leads are well skilled and carry their various personas consistently and convincingly throughout. Lastly a generous nod to the well-woven tapestry of special effect's, half of which may go unnoticed nd merely serves a purpose to maintain the suspension of disbelief. Again- FOUR STARS!

0061692042|5.0|I completely loved this story!  I could not read it fast enough and am circulating the book amongst my friends at this time.  I have not previously read Richard Ford, but will be seeking out more of his books, since I find myself so enamored with Canada.<br /><br />I typically read the first few pages of a book to see if it grabs my attention.  As I'm sure you already know the first two sentences of this book are good enough to get the hooks deep in to your skin and that is the reason I was chomping at the bit to read it.<br /><br />Regardless of the content of the story, I found the story flowed flawlessly.  I never felt like I missed something, never had to read over and didn't have to stop and ask myself \\"What the Heck?\\".  Well....except for that one little thing in the middle of the book that really threw me-if you've read it, you know what I'm talking about.  What the heck was that?<br /><br />It is amazing to see how a set of twins reared in the same environment can be affected so differently and turn out to have such starkly different lives.  It does bring to mind how different my brother and I are.  There is no doubt that Dell and Berner had to endure a pretty complicated life as a result of their parents terrible decision to rob a bank but Ford takes us through the tough times with ease.<br /><br />This is a super read, I highly recommend it.

0099579936|1.0|OMG I am 50 shades of annoyed.<br /><br />Was the author trying to get in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most use of the same word?! If I knew where her next book signing was I would send MY inner goddess to seriously bitch slap her inner goddess for wasting my freaking time!<br /><br />Is she still writing with a pencil & paper? You know we have these machines now that allow you to not only type your manuscript but they have this clever little gadget called a mouse where if you click the right button a list comes up & one of the items says \\"synonyms\\" A synonym is a word having the same or nearly the same meaning as another in the language. You can use this clever little tool to change words such as murmur to words like: articulate, confide, express, say, sigh, utter, voice, whisper.<br /><br />If you want to use a pencil & paper for 50 shades of STUPID! GET A THESAURUS !!<br />My theory is this... You remember those old school encyclopedia sets, the ones sold by door to door salesman back in the 70's? Optional gold edged pages & leather binding. When you bought the whole collection they'd throw in the dictionary & thesaurus.<br /><br />Her family was unable to afford the set of encylopedia's, but knowing their daughters dreams of one day becoming a writer her parents sprung for the paperback collection of Websters \\"Words that start with\\". The whole A-Z collection! She treasured this collection & after her parents passed she valued this gift even more. Reading a new word every day..... she was on the M's when tragedy struck.<br /><br />The entire collection was damaged beyond recognition in an apartment fire. She had gone out for a walk (stroll, jaunt, hike) and left a candle burning near a window. Yes... The light was on, but no one was home. The flame grew angry in the breeze & grabbed (caught hold, hooked, seized) the sheer drapery covering the window. Tearing through her home twisting & melting all her treasures until nothing was left. She heard thesirens and rushed (bolted, hurried, scrambled) home arriving just in time to see her entire floor swallowed (consumed, engulfed, ingested) by the flames. The heat emanating from the concrete made her feel as if she was Icarus flying into the sun.<br /><br />Digging through the rubble and ashes that remained of her life (with her hair pulled back in a hair tie she found in her purse or her pocket. It seems these are easy to find just like her boyfriend always had a condom in his pocket)She discovers that one of the books was completely unscathed by the inferno. Thank goodness ! The M's ! Oh, the M's !! Murmur, mutter, mimic, mumble, muddle, moan. Magnificent !<br /><br />Her inner goddess is delirious with excitement (energy, thrill, passion), She recalls (remembers, conjures up, recollects, thinks back) she was reading it in the bathtub, that must have been what protected it. She imagined (envisioned, thought, fantasized) the cold porcelain embracing (encircling, wrapping around, enveloping) the small delicate folds of this frightened little volume, the flames feverishly licking the sides of its protector, eager to sample its tantalizing creases. The searing heat engulfing everything around it, while it lies safe in the impenetrable arms of its guardian.<br /><br />How romantic....... ?  NOT !<br /><br />I was 50 shades of disappointed & my inner goddess wants her money back. Ok... I borrowed the book, I want my time back!<br /><br />500 pages, 300 or so words per page & the author uses murmur 200 times! YES I counted! On pg 121, 146 & 252 she used it 4 times on the same page! Coming in a close second for most used word: inner goddess a whopping 55 times. Straight from her \\"words that start with M\\" book; mutter was repeated 46 times. Taciturn was used 5 times to describe at least 3 different people. Hair ties & condoms were available pretty much anywhere. And to top it all off SPOILER ALERT the ending is the most unsatisfying ending I've ever read. This is supposedto be a romance novel? It's a book about a bad boyfriend, some rough sex a lot of whining & a few temper tantrums.<br /><br />That's about 5-6 hrs I will never get back. To be honest though...., I do have this weird urge (compulsion, weakness, yearning) to read the next 2 books in the series just because I can't  believe that it could possibly get any worse.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|PicShop works fine when I can open a photo on my Droid X.  Often it reverts back to the 'Open AN Image' selection after I have already selected one from my gallery.  I presume the pixel count of the high-definition photos is too much for the app, since lower-resolution photos seem to work best.<br />I will wait to see what improvements come in later releases before I remove it entirely.

For example \\"holy crap,double crap,jeez, crimson red, flushing, etc...\\". I live in the west coast and i never heard people say \\" double crap\\" before.. Other than that the story is kinda fun to read before bedtime. I wouldn't buy the second and third book because the writing is so bad.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|The 3rd movie in the Twilight Saga is actually one of my fvorites.<br />Howevr, I was extremely disappointed in Kristen and Robert;s running<br />commentary included in the bonus material. I was looking forward to<br />hearing them speak as themselves, get their thouhts on the film. But the<br />entire segment depicted them as giggly schoolchildren. They made constant<br />sarcastic, disparaging comments about practically everything: the story itself, the acting of other characters,<br />everything. I came away with the feeling that they thought the story was just stupid. I wanted to like these actors. I came away disappointed in these 2 people, whom I had admired so much in the films.
B004LWZW8I|2.0|'\\"Immortals\\" is one of those revisionist films where traditional Greek myth was not Hollywood enough to film as is; instead, because it comes from the same producers who brought us \\"300,\\" it uses saturated hues, comic book-style special effects, and a whole lot of toned stunt men to try to make up for the lack of plot.  It doesn't work.<br /><br />Theseus (Henry Cavill) is a typical working class guy, a ferocious fighter who is uninterested in doing his civic duty as a guard.  Theseus' mom Aethra (Anne Day-Jones) is slaughtered by rampaging megalomaniac Hyperion (Mickey Rourke, chewing scenery). Hyperion is hell-bent on releasing the titans to punish the gods for allowing his wife to die, and he will stop at nothing to find the virgin oracle who can find the artifact of their destruction. Well, Theseus isn't the forgiving kind either and plots his own vengeance.  Nobody messes with Theseus' mom.<br /><br />What ensues is a race first for the oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) and then for the Bow of Epirus, or something like that. Theseus is unwillingly dragged into the fight by the gods themselves, all sporting distinctive headdresses but rarely introduced by name (is that Hermes? Ares? Some guy with spiky headware?). The special effects are reserved for these interventions, which manifest primarily as slow-motion capture sequences: Poseidon launching a tidal wave, Ares killing people, etc. It's like \\"The Matrix\\" for Greek myth.<br /><br />It turns out the Epirus Bow is pretty much just laying around, which is how Theseus manages to find it when he's burying his poor unavenged mother. Then a guy in a bull's head helmet shows up (Robert Maillett) called the Minotaur.  If you paid attention in class you'll remember that in Greek myth Theseus killed the Minotaur.  See what they did there?  \\"Immortals\\" is Greek myth with less special effects.<br /><br />Hyperion eventually manages to get the Bow, which is a weapon of mass destruction. Theseus tries to warn the Hellenic King Cassander (Stephen McHattie) but of course he doesn't listen, instead relying on his massive wall to protect his people.  It's no match for the Bow, and it's not long before Hyperion stomps his way through the Hellenics on his way to assault Mount Tartarus where the titans are imprisoned.<br /><br />SPOILER: The titans are released. The gods show up, led by Zeus (Luke Evans) to do battle.  The titans consist of Underwear Models # 1 through 25, covered in body paint, mugging for the camera, and acting more like a bunch of savages than the progenitors of the gods.  They're the equivalent of thugs and ninjas in action movies, there only to allow the gods to show off how awesome they are.<br /><br />\\"Immortals\\" is a low-budget film that hopes you don't remember your Greek mythology. For those of us who do, it's hard not to feel embarrassed for director Tarsem Singh.Cassander (Stephen McHattie) but of course he doesn't listen, instead relying on his massive wall to protect his people.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this Youversion Bible app! I have it downloaded on my Kindle Fire, this enables me to take it to church, follow along with my Pastor and take notes, then study while I'm at home, without all the paper mess. Yes, I really love this app!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I cannot believe all the hype for this book.  I am glad I read it since everyone has been talking about it but there isn't much of a story line.  I didn't really like any of the characters - they were shallow and didn't seem to have much personality.  The sex really was laughable.  The writing was poor - much to much repetition.  If she bit her lip one more time or spoke softly I thought I would scream!!  People tell me I should read the other two books in the trilogy.  The writing is supposed to get better and there is actually a story to follow.  I may read them in the future but it won't be any time soon.

B007HJ9JEA|4.0|As I began watching Game of Thrones I almost gave up on it after about 4 episodes. I dont care for the raw sex bits that much, think its in bad taste and disrupts story for me, but did start to enjoy it more after episode 4. Thats why I stopped wathing Sparticus, just way over the top for me. These are great stories that can be told but they seem to think they have to be close to hard porn to attract viewers. Game of Thrones finished well and am looking forward to season 2. Just hope they concentrate on the story and not all the bedroom antics.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|so far I have enjoyed this game. I still. am trying to figure out how the entire game and games work but it has been fun so far.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I had been looking for a glass cutter so that a friend & I could make some glasses out of cobalt bottles.  Many of them seemed to be complicated or too expensive.  I had seen the G2 demonstrated on YouTube & the man in the video made it seem like exactly what I wanted.  Turns out he was right - the G2 Glass Cutter was very inexpensive & simple to operate.  We have had a lot of success using the G2 Glass Cutter.  In fact, I would say that it is a \\"cut above\\" all the rest!
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|Having paged through some of the old John Carter stories a few years back, a fairly campy version of the same brand of Sci-Fi typical to Jules Verne was something I expected. But Disney seemed to want to straddle the lines between this mold of Sci-Fi and the grand epic movies that Kevin Costner was dabbling in from \\"Dances With Wolves\\" to \\"The Post Man\\", exhibiting some of the strengths of the former, but also some of the negatives found in the latter flop. The characters are sympathetic, particularly the striking princess of the city of Helium (aka the heroine of the story and John Carter's love interest), and John Carter's character manages to embody the reluctant Byronic hero depicted in the novel.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest hurdle for most younger people watching this movie will be the antiquated understanding of the planet Mars as potentially having humanoid life on it (and breathable, oxygen rich air), with a healthy helping of cliche visuals from Alister Crowley's concept of what an alien looks like amid all the non-humanoid characters on the planet. Throw into the equation a group of deceitful aliens that prey on the destruction of planets that all but embody the cliche of an Illuminati sect., and most will probably puzzle over this being labeled as Sci-Fi, when its parameters seem to conform more to high fantasy given the updated understanding most have of astronomy.<br /><br />Nevertheless, for a kid-friendly adventure movie that is mercifully not made entirely out of Pixar characters and CGI generated images, this is pretty well realized and mercifully free of the overt slapstick comedy that tends to get employed in many modern reworkings of classic 19th century fiction. The inclusion of the author in the story itself is an interesting touch that, while not uncommon during the era that the story was penned, has since become a less common practice in both the cinema and the printed page. Don't expect a dazzling series of plot twists and depth of character reserved for the likes of \\"Inception\\", but definitely expect to be entertained.ter reserved for the likes of \\"Inception\\", but definitely expect to be entertained.

The apps i downloaded suck bad,I have a toshiba thrive and a samsung epic 4g. I installed sphero drive and the sphero apps on both, It starts out great but after a few minutes the apps crash. I have to restart the app but it takes forever to get back on to bluetooth, Then they crash again both on my tablet and smartphone. I am sure they will fix the problems, But buying a ball that cost 130 bucks plus tax should work as said.Giving it a 3 star only for the robot ball, The apps get a zero (0). Come on guys fix the apps,im almost sure they will.
034580404X|3.0|Book one done.  Well written and I am from the area the book takes place, so my attention was grabbed.  The characters are in their 20's and part of the fantasy is that 1/4 percent of real life experiences wealth for the travel and experiences.  But, the characters do grow and I like that.

B002UJIY7A|4.0|This is the ideal mystery movie - one that leaves out all of the obvious foreshadowing and just leaves you guessing up until the endo of the movie. The casting is great, the locale is refreshingly natural and interesting, the dialogue is believable, and the acting is top-notch. I really enjoyed this movie and can't say much about it without spoilers, so I'll just leave you to go view it for yourself. Next time you hear of a friend planning a trip to Hawaii, have them watch this movie first!

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This is a good book but I feel it is way overpriced for Kindle books.  I would say it is more like 2.99 maybe 3.99 pushing it... I wasn't disappointed with the story, but overall there were many editing mistakes especially for the high price of 8 bucks!  in one part there were some pages that clearly didn't belong from earlier in the story just stuck right in the middle of a scene.  I had to skip through to find where the correct words were.  So annoying!  Book is good, price is not.  Very fast read.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book is basically 50 Shades of Grey fanfiction, which was Twilight fanfiction, which was Jane Austen fanfiction.<br /><br />We are introduced to Eva Tramell and Gideon Cross, who stumble upon each other and have an instant, boiling, love connection. The next time they are together Gideon asks if he can **ck her... nice. They eventually start dating, and discover everything about each other.<br /><br />Oh wait... they don't do that, because we are given hints as to what Gideon's issues are. Over and over again Gideon alludes to some traumatic event in his life that has scarred him. He has nightmares, he screams in his sleep, furiously masturbates in his sleep, and eventually attacks Eva in his sleep. He tells her over and over and OVER again about the first time he had \\"consentual sex\\" but never gives her more information to explain his serious problems. AND SHE DOESN'T PRESS THE ISSUE. She asks him to go to therapy, and just figures everything is fine, because she loves him. She really loves him, even though she runs away at every single slight bit of trouble. She finds condoms and runs. She sees an ex girlfriend and runs. The girl has absolutely no clue how to ask for clarification on any issue regarding her boyfriend, she would rather run away and pout.<br /><br />Eva has a male roommate, who seems really nice. Until he cheats on his boyfriend, then Eva finds him in an drug-fueled orgy in their living room. Cary has his own issues and problems, but guess what. They are NEVER ADDRESSED EITHER!!!<br /><br />Eva has her own problems, and denial seems to be the biggest one. Her step brother rapes her for years when she is a child, when her mother finds out they leave the family, but never tell her father. Makes no sense. How do you keep a secret like this? Eva is also worried about Gideon finding out, because their affair is so public. She is worried that reporters will dig and find this dirt... So she confesses all so he won't be surprised. But, it never occurs to her to give dear ole dad, who she claims to love so much, a heads up. Right, cause it's better to find out about your daughter's sexual abuse from a tabloid or news program, instead of your daughter, or her mother... WHEN IT HAPPENED.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes was at Gideon's parent's garden party. Gideon and Eva sneak into a crowded hallway and have sex. No, wait. They sneak into a library to have sex, but are observed by Gideon's ex-girlfriend and his brother. This is the busiest library I've ever heard of. And, they never stop having sex, no matter who walks in!!! It is hilarious!<br /><br />The author has a nice writing style, the book was a fun and quick read. But, it really offended me that all these plot points were introduced, problems presented, and there was no resolution. I feel the author and publisher are setting us up for a trilogy, and I don't like to be tricked into buying more books to wrap this one up.<br /><br />Imagine if Star Wars ended when Luke met Obi Wan... It's just wrong, underhanded, and dishonest.<br /><br />If you are thinking about reading this, just keep in mind that you are not getting a complete book.

0345803493|1.0|I truly do not get the hype around theses poorly written novels. I am not certain one may even call them novels because there is Nooooo narrative! Am I genuinely supposed to believe that Ana got promoted to Editor after five days of very poor work ethic, in an office she is said several times to be \\"under-qualified\\" to be a part of? She shows up late, disheveled, as always, crying, emailing and daydreaming, while she takes a two hour lunch break. Ooooh, but her spectacular summaries of many book chapters one is all her boss needs to know she it Editor worthy. BS! There is a huge build up to find out that Christian is a \\"sadist,\\" ummm I thought we knew that from page one? Well, considering how horrifically repetitive James' writing is, perhaps she forgot that she already told us that Christian receives pleasure out of a another woman's pain 687 different times. Groundbreaking revelation Ana! If I read \\"flushed with rouge,\\" \\"sardonic\\" or \\"childlike\\" one more time I am certain I will vomit, repeatedly, pun intended. How the hell will they turn these lame books into a movie if there is noooo storyline. Do the viewers just get to sit in the theater reading emails across the world's largest computer screen?
B006RUJST6|5.0|It's a YA book- so keep that in mind. But for what it's worth, it was a good read. Some of the other reviewers said it was predictable (but there's really nothing new under the sun, so...) I thought it had a lot of different elements. From slam poetry (which a lot of people don't know about), to song lyrics, to sweet moments that define people and relationships.<br />The main character- Lake, is feisty, and really likable. I enjoyed the development of the characters, and the small details that make a story unique.<br />This book was a good read- fast, easy, (a few mistakes in editing), but really likeable. I bought the second book as soon as I finished the first.
0345803485|1.0|Dreadful! I skipped paragraph after paragraph, just to finish and I am CERTAIN, I missed NOTHING. There is noooo storyline, literally, nothing happens. SPOILER ALERT! He buys her something, He ties her up, He buys her something, he ties her up, She cries, He buys her something and then he ties her up. Am I supposed to believe that Ana is the FIRST woman to say, \\"Oh Christian I can't accept this. You Shouldn't have...?\\" It does not even matter because then she still KEEEEEPS THE GIIIFTS. So is she really that special? In Book two, she tells Him that she does not want all the fancy clothes he gives her, but when she looks in the closet and they are missing she REGRETS saying that to him. She is then relieved to find all her clothing placed safely in Christian's closet. Wooh! Close one Ana, you almost showed you incredibly average colors. Ane is the first woman he has ever slept with. It is to UNBEARABLE for him, so instead he just plays the piano all night? CORNY and been done again and again. Seriously, why is he so troubled? Because at age two and a half he lived a terrible life. I do not even remember what I had for dinner last night. Come on. So James is saying that the first 4 years of his life, before his adoption, have had more of an impact than the last 23 years he had living a brilliant life with a fantastic family. That is Christian begging for attention, in order to justify his desire to beat women. He would be this way even if it were not for his mother, he is just using something that we all know he does not remember, as a SCAPEGOAT. Now he may degrade woman however he likes, because the doctor says so....though if you read on, even the doctor does not believe his BS story!

B0089IGUP4|5.0|Gaslight is back with their major label debut Handwritten, and they just keep getting better. From the album art, to the music, to the amazing review by Nick Hornby (Author of \\"High Fidelity\\", \\"Juliet, Naked\\" and more) in the liner notes, you get the feeling that Handwritten is an album you will be listening to, rather than an album that you should be listening too. But will you?<br /><br />The first single off the record, \\"45\\" has been out for a couple of months now, and not that I'm an avid listener of the radio, but I haven't heard the song once, nor heard anyone that isn't a fan previously mentioning the song being on the radio. That could be due to living in Southern California where KROQ, as world famous as it might be, is still playing the Red Hot Chili Peppers every 14 minutes. Anyway, the song is poppy, radio friendly, and will easily get stuck in your head with its crisp guitars, and Brian Fallon's brilliantly hoarse voice saying wo-oh during the chorus. It's a song for the summer, and I hope it gets some radio play, and I'm sure Mercury is pushing it out their like a good label should. The band is leaving on tour with Rise Against this summer and fall, and that may bring some attention to them, as their tour with Thrice did when 59 Sound was released, so we may, but I don't trust the radio, and neither should you.<br /><br />The rest of the album is much like \\"45\\". If you've lived in the past 20 years or so (or ever really) you'll recognize something from this album, whether it be a song title like \\"Here Comes My Man\\" which instantly summons the Pixies for me, or the song \\"Howl\\" which reminded me of the Allen Ginsberg poem of the same name. Maybe it will be the guitar riff in \\"Keepsake\\" which sounds so much like Tom Petty's \\"Last Dance With Mary Jane\\" that I almost thought it was a cover for a few seconds, or the beginning to \\"National Anthem\\" which is so much \\"I'm on Fire\\" by The Boss, that it hurts. You will recognize this album, and it will stick withyou if you give it a chance, even if it doesn't stick on the radio.<br /><br />I believe Fallon, the amazing lyricist who sometimes over shadows his band, wants it to stick to you too, if not boring DJs. This album feels more important than their previous releases. Perhaps it's the help of a big shot producer Brendan O'Brien, a man the band likely idolized, but I think it is more that Fallon has matured as a poet, and is perhaps not afraid to put \\"Too Much Blood on the Page\\". The songs seem to have the same themes as songs off of The 59 Sound and American Slang, but less fear. For instance, in the song \\"Keepsake\\", Fallon croons about an absent father, and says simply, but profoundly, that he \\"just want[s] to love someone who has the same blood\\" giving away the meaning, probably, to so many cryptic songs from the other big releases. Handwritten is dark, it's moody, it's brilliant, and it's definitely not full of sad songs. Mae is a love song that will bring you back to your teens faster than somebody mentioning sex with a pastry, or Phoebe Cates.<br /><br />Don't let the teenage love songs fool you, Gaslight has grown up, just enough, in every way. O'Brien (Producer) has calmed down some of the craziness with the lead guitar that has always been distinctive of their sound, which is probably the best thing to happen to the band. He hasn't eliminated Horowitz's leads, just helped them to sit a little deeper in the mix. He may have given the band a few different effects pedals as well as the lead riffs sound beefier, and less tinny than on previous albums. Alex Rosamilia's drums also sound crisper, bigger, and definitely better. I have a feeling, though I haven't tried it, that this album will sound amazing on a big sound system, or in a car with a great stereo, which is kind of the point of working with the big boys.<br /><br />Handwritten, on a whole, should be the litmus test for what a major label should do for a band The label should make them better. Not bigger, different, or more fashionable, just better. Mercury and O'Brien seem to have done just that and allowed the band to just grow naturally. And oh ye hipster, don't fear that they've sold out. They haven't as far as I can tell. The fact that the band has essentially signed each of their names to the front of this album should be proof enough to any man who would take a handshake as a promise. They believe in it, and you should too. With the exception of \\"45\\", maybe if it gets the radio play I suspect it might eventually, you can probably be sure that Gaslight will still feel like your little secret, and if they aren't after this gets a little more time on the shelf, I think you should be okay with that too. Will we be listening to this album, rather than feeling like we should be listening to it? I know I will be, and if you are any fan of rock music in any of it's forms, you should be too.

B005LAII0I|1.0|I figured going in this movie was going to be bad, but how bad was yet to be seen. I watched almost 30 minutes of this terrible movie and could stand no more. I seldom stop watching a movie after I have started, but this was an exception. I don't think even children would enjoy this. This was a waste of time, money, and talent. Avoid this horrible piece of work at all cost. I would not even watch it when it comes to TV.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game it kicks azz I think every one should play this game the gang is all here
B0085776BG|1.0|This movie is an insult to the brave men who really were Tuskegee Airmen.<br /><br />I couldn't get past the horrible acting and cheesy lines in the first two scenes. After watching Cuba Gooding Jr. in Men of Honor, this movie is revolting. And the CGI is so thick that I felt like I was playing an Xbox game instead of watching a movie. Horrendous.<br /><br />You want a great, new war movie? Go and rent \\"My Way\\". Comparing \\"Red Tails\\" with \\"My Way\\" is like comparing a broken bicycle to a showroom Ferrari.

1416955070|1.0|This book frustrates me. If it were a completely bad book I'd just forget about it, but the story has a promise that just wasn't fulfilled.<br /><br />First off, the prose is extremely uneven. Clare has a fondness for similes and metaphors, and while some of them work, a lot are cringe-worthy or outright nonsensical. At one point something is described as \\"bending as easily as a blade of grass bending sideways\\", which is just painful, and at another a character \\"shines with the light of his own personal miracle.\\" And the book. Is. *Riddled* with them. While I'm all for describing the setting, at times the scenes were so bogged down with the weight of their descriptions that it took away from the action.<br /><br />As for the characters, Clary is an idiot and very often just plain irritating. While she does have her sympathetic moments, they're few and far between, and she often comes across as a brat. Isabelle and Alec don't get enough development to be memorable, and then there's Jace.<br /><br />I have no idea why we're supposed to like this guy. He's a snide, bigoted, obnoxious little jerk who needs a good slap upside the head. I realize he had an abusive childhood, but that's no excuse for how horrible a person he is in this story. He doesn't have a single redeeming virtue. Isabelle says his rudeness is why he's sexy, which just...no. Rudeness is not sexy, it's *irritating*. He's even more of a brat than Clary, yet all the characters fawn over him like he's something special, rather than an irritating child.<br /><br />I did like Luke, Dorothea, and especially Simon, and I think they were criminally underused. Simon in particular seemed to exist so the Shadowhunters could abuse him, and Clary made very little effort to defend him, for all he's supposed to be her best friend. As is standard in YA fiction, he's in love with Clary (though God knows why), yet she ignores him in favor of the bag of worthlessness that is Jace. I really wish the book had been told from his POV, because he was actually a sympathetic character<br /><br />The villain...I'm sorry, but this guy was a joke. Even the Shadowhunters didn't seem to take him seriously: they'd talk about how evil and scary he was, then ignore it in favor of food and makeovers. It was a total case of telling, not showing. If even the characters can't be consistently threatened by this guy, I'm not going to be, either. Plus, 'Valentine' is one of the worst possible names you could give a bad guy. Every time I read his name, I thought of cupids and candy hearts.<br /><br />The world has a lot of potential. I really liked the Silent Brothers, and wish we'd seen more of them. The few examples we had of Shadowhunters didn't impress me, since every last one of them were insulting bigots when it came to \\"mundies\\", regarding them as stupid at best -- and not hesitant to say so. I'd like to know if they're an exception, or if all the Shadowhunters are like that. They spent a surprisingly short amount of time in the City of Bones itself, and I wish Clare had devoted more pages to exploring that place.<br /><br />The plot ultimately relies on too many contrived coincidences. Again, it has a lot of potential, but it completely falls apart at the end. It relies on things like *nobody* realizing a W was actually an upside-down M (in what font are the two identical enough to be mistaken for one another?), and one character having never seen a picture of the guy he's supposed to be hunting. The \\"shocking twist\\" can be guessed halfway through the book, yet the characters all act stunned. It just makes them come off as complete morons.<br /><br />The climax itself is anticlimactic. It involves a lot more talking that fighting, and Valentine's escape (spoiler: he lives, surprise, surprise) relies on all the other people in the room being too stupid to kill him while they had ample chances.<br /><br />All in all, it's a waste of what should have been a really cool idea, but Clare ignores it in favor of constantly rhapsodizing about how supposedly wonderful Clary and Jace are. If the quality of this book is any indicator for the rest of the series, I won't be picking them up.avor of constantly rhapsodizing about how supposedly wonderful Clary and Jace are. If the quality of this book is any indicator for the rest of the series, I won't be picking them up.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Its a life story about faith, love, charity, humility, and the call to serve Christ.
B000AS4L16|4.0|This documetary is slow, but worth the 10 hour investment.  The interviews can never be recreated.  A great source of information.
B00846REIS|2.0|I read all 3 books of Fifty shades of Grey! AWESOME series! This book \\"Bared to you\\" is just like she was reading Fifty shades of Grey book and changing a few things here and there, way too many similar things, Funny thing is the two main male charcs have same initials! \\"Christian Grey\\" \\"Gideon Cross\\" (But opposite) Both are filthy rich, both are Dom's, both have drivers that are their security guard, and both females fight to keep their jobs , both females just out of college, if I remember correctly they are both in advertising? both to me are to damn close, and one very down side I have to say I do not like that this author uses in this book, is the \\"c\\" word to describe a female part, that is suppose to be a love story, when that word has always been used as a way of degrading mainly woman! So I am sorry, but when it came to those moments, I cringed and had a very hard time seeing this man as loving! At least EL James had a much better way of expressing love, even in a dominate way! I would much more recommend the Fifty Shades of Grey series! Not to mention at-least she comes across more original!

1451637500|3.0|This book reads like it was not given the care and attention of Ms. Bujold's other books.  It felt superficial.  Also, I easily predicted every major plot turn, including the last one.  I wouldn't have minded if her writing had been up to the standard she has set in her other Vor saga books.  It makes me worry about her upcoming book, \\"Captain Vorpatril's Alliance\\", which I have been looking forward to reading.<br /><br />For those of you looking for this book on Kindle, you can download it from Ms. Bujold's main publisher's web site, baen.com.  I have been using this site for her books since I discovered it.  If a Kindle book is available on both Baen and Amazon, it is cheaper on Baen.  Baen also has Kindle versions of her compendium books, which Amazon does not.  The compendiums generally contain 2 novels and a novella, so they are a bargain.  If you're nervous about downloading, you can test it out by downloading one of the free books Baen offers.  Check it out!
1598561634|5.0|I've been using my copy of this version of BHS for about four years now and it is still in amazing condition. I pick away at it everyday for about 15 to 30 minutes and I have no complaints to make against it. I couldn't ask for a better looking Hebrew font. It doesn't have that cartoonish look that so many Hebrew bibles seem to adopt; it is extremely readable. The textual variants and suggestions found in the footnotes are extremely useful when working with sticky passages. The paper quality is high, and I love the way it stays open. This version receives my highest recommendation.

All you do is turn it on, connect your computer or other device that you want to share files with to same network/wifi, go to the URL it uses, &amp; start dragging files &amp; folders between devices &amp; that's it. everything is done from your Web browser so can be used with any device that is connected to same network. Very convenient.

0345803485|1.0|I have decided to write my own versions of 50 Shades.  The titles will go like this.........\\"50 Shades of Stupid\\", \\"50 Shades of Boring\\", and last but not least, \\"50 Shades of Wah, Wah, Waaaaaah\\"  These books took me all of one day to read each one.  The writing is horrible; all dialogue and thinking.  No real creative drama, just ho hum here we go again sex on every page or two.  If it isn't sex they're having, they're building up to it........ALL DAY LONG!!!  Oh yes and my characters will star Pepe Le Pew as Christian Grey and his coquettish girlfriend Mimieux the cat as Anastasia Steele.  Jessica Rabbit will star as Mrs. Robinson.  And that about sums it up.
0439023521|3.0|There are some books that jump off the shelf because their creativity is an easy disguise for a sign of the times. When my wife first suggested the Hunger Games, I thought it was too overtly brutal to become popular. Boy was I wrong. However, the reason it is becoming the next pop-culture book and movie series appears to come from our sense of connection to the plight of the characters. That should lead us to ask: Are we as Americans so desperate in our current recession that we can identify with the Hunger Games? As I read the first book, the link became clear. I could feel the pain of Katniss. She exists in a world where the few have everything and the many suffer in silence. While our current situation as a country is nowhere near the desperate times experienced during the great depression, there are a lot of people suffering in silence.<br /><br />I watched the movie before reading the book but it did not change my opinion of the underlying drive. You can't help but to feel for the main characters as they face each obstacle before them in what appears to be an impossible environment. How many of us are looking at our small businesses and dwindling paychecks while trying to plan for a future that appears so uncertain. As long as I struggle in my own life, I'll feel the need to follow the adventures of anyone who struggles so mightily in theirs. This is one reason why we love fiction so much. This is why I'm now invested in the Hunger Games. I need to believe that no matter how bad things appear, there is still hope.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|its like temple run and zombie highway and its easy to control. its a fun game no matter what. I a s f s d f r f sf d de f fr f f r th g f
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is an entertaining superhero action flick for the whole family but if you want to see some more serious acting, check out Amazing Spider-Man and Dark Knight Rises. Bruce Banner/Hulk was a delightful surprise, I wasn't too happy about replacing Edward Norton since the Incredible Hulk follows the continuity, but the new guy did a good job. As always, this movie was going to be more focused on RDJ than the rest of the cast which makes this seem more like Iron Man and Friends. Can't wait for the dvd.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game! It gets super super additcting and its really fun. I can play for hours on my Kindle playing this game. You can rack up cash and build your own village and make friends. The awesome part is that you dont need to purchase any thing unless you want to buy a ton of coins. But they give you so many coins for completeing quests there's no point for paying for anything. This is a awesome game and you should get it!

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|okay seriously People The App Works JUST FINE ITS YOUR STINKIN DEVICE !!!!!DUH!!!! but anyway this app is a must have for all devices
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's a wonderful thing to discover a great writer.<br /><br />Chapter 1 of the Wool Omnibus was written as a stand-alone short story, and it's one of the best that I've ever read - and I read a lot.  I'd put it up there with Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\" and Roald Dahl's \\"Man from the South\\" for its absolute mind-blowing plot twists and sharply drawn characters.  \\"Wool\\" is, simply put, science fiction at its very finest.<br /><br />It was hard to believe that a whole book could follow up on that incredible beginning.  Once I stopped grieving for characters loved but lost, settled into the story, and started to see the entirety of the world that Hugh Howey has created, though, the book was page-turner (for me, a page-swiper, actually) that was hard to put down.  These books have everything - finely drawn characters the reader can really care about; the technical details that hard-core sci-fi readers love and make the world actually work; moral, social, and political problems to ponder; and lots of action.  The ending leaves the reader fully satisfied, yet pondering about what will happen next.<br /><br />I have a feeling that I'll be revisiting the men and women of Silo 18 many times in the next months and years, just as I often revisit Orson Scott Card's Ender universe, J.K. Rowlings's Hogwarts, and Terry Pratchett's lovely Discworld.  Thank you, Mr. Howey, for creating your own post-apocalyptic corner of the science fiction/fantasy multiverse.
B003O86FMW|5.0|love love loved the book. All three books in the hunger games trilogy were so good, i couldn't put them down!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|******************  SPOILERS******<br /><br />It wasnt as good as Catching Fire but it was still very good. it was very exiting and a page turner. i love how Katniss and Peeta get married at the end. it wasnt too unexpected though. but prims death was very unexpected. I cant wait for the movie. i think its coming out sometime in 2019.

B006RUJST6|1.0|This book was awful. I cant believe I actually paid for it. Dont waste your time, or your money, on this book!
B000IJ79WU|5.0|My favorite superhero film ever is Superman the Movie. I grew up watching it, I fell in love with it again when it came out on dvd and I continue to believe it is a masterpiece. I never liked Superman II. Even as a kid, I realized it seemed so different from the first. But I never realized, or hoped for, a different version that was intended from the man who directed Superman the Movie, one great Richard Donner.<br />Clearly, there are scenes in the Daily Planet that were filmed right along with the first film because it is a seamless continuation that Lester version completely lacks. And the dialogue is more interesting.<br />And there is one scene at the Falls where it looks and feels different from the prior scenes because it was, I think, a screen test. But I did not mind one bit.<br />I enjoyed this one much much more than the original theatrical release.<br />And there was some great scenes between Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder that reminded me of their chemistry.<br />Now, Superman's ultimate resolution in the end will seem very familiar but I honestly didn't mind. I felt like this was a great gift I had finally been given. Finally, this was the Superman sequel I wanted to see.<br />And having Brando makes a difference. His presence was sorely missing in the theatrical release.<br />I loved watching this film. It was well worth the wait. Not as good as the first one but still far better than the original Superman II.

0345803485|5.0|I have read so many bad reveiws for this series.  I think most who say it is bad have either not read the book or haven't read it fully.  Yes, there is quite a few graphic sex scenes throughout, but honestly, that isn't what the series is about once you start to look beyond the sex.  In my opinion, this is a story of unconditional love and is so romantic at times.  I thought the author did an amazing job with the main characters and showing how they evolve from the first book to the third book.  I read all 3 books in 4 days. I was completely entralled.  I caught myself laughing and smiling (loved their email exchanges) and then crying and anxious at other times.  I became so involved in the story and started to really feel for Christian and started to understand why he did the things he did.  Yes, it could be better written and is repetative quite a bit, but I think it was one of the easiest books I've read in a LONG time.  I love how the author shows us a small excerpt of Christain's view at the end of the 3rd book.  Genius!  In fact, I've started to read book one again now that I saw a small inkling into Christian's mind and it has made the first book even more exciting the 2nd time around.  Such a different spin!  I have heard rumors that there might be a book based soley on Christain's viewpoint.  I hope so, I would love to read that.  While there are sex scenes in the second and third books, I will say they are a bit more tame and you really start to see the beautiful love they have for each other.  Give them a chance.  I don't regret reading them one bit!!!

B00127RAJY|4.0|I've been doing this video for about 2 weeks now and just moved on to level 2, which is much harder than level 1.  It's a great workout.  I'm not trying to lose weight, just turn my \\"baby fat\\" into muscle and get in some cardio at the same time. I love that I can get this workout done in 20 minutes, usually before my kids get up for the day.<br /><br />The only improvements that would make this a 5 star video are 1. the ability to skip the intro.  I really don't want to waste my time waiting for the intro to complete every morning before I can get to the menu! and 2. tones to indicate exercise changes when the vocal track is turned off.  Some of the floor exercises make it difficult to see the TV while exercising and still maintain proper form, and after a week of listening to Jillian Michaels say the same thing every day, I just couldn't take it anymore.<br /><br />Even with the above drawbacks, it's still a great workout video that doesn't get boring after a week.  I actually look forward to getting up each morning to do the workout, which isn't like me at all!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I heard a lot about this show when it first came out but didn't have cable at the time so missed the whole thing.  Several months later, enter Amazon Instant Video: knowing absolutely nothing about the show except for hearing great things about it from friends, I went ahead and bought the first season.  Within the span of 3 days my husband and I watched the entire season and LOVED it!  At first I was like \\"what the heck is going on?\\" but soon you are so into the show that you don't want to stop!<br /><br />As far as the actual product, I purchased Season 1 via Amazon Instant Video in SD.  I thought about buying HD but decided to save a few dollars by getting it in standard definition.  I will say that that difference in the picture quality is noticeable if you are watching the show on a big screen (over 40 inches).  However, soon you get so involved in the story line that it doesn't even matter.  We also watched this on a 22 inch screen and weren't affected by the picture quality at all, in fact I didn't even think about the fact that it wasn't in HD.<br /><br />If you are an HD fanatic, then you will want to buy the HD version.  If you are less sensitive to it or are planning to watch this on a small screen then you will be fine with standard definition.
0553386794|5.0|I must have looked at this book a dozen times or so before I actually bought it.  When I saw the trailer for the TV series I thought it looked interesting and, since I don't have HBO, I decided to read the books.  I was amazed to find out that this was the fantasy book I'd been hoping for all this time.  I love the genre but get sick of it always been goody-goody heroes vs. evil puppy-kicking villains.  I love that this series has many likable characters on every side of a big war.  I'd highly recommend both the book and the TV series.
B003L77GGK|4.0|Overall this was a pretty good season, I believe that previous season's were better, but that's just my opinion. I just hope future one's will continue to get better now that Sara Gamble is no longer the executive producer.

B0055MI8K2|1.0|Teva is not what it use to be and this new version clearly proves that. Why are they messing with success? ANSWER - cheaper materials, higher profit margin... ENTER - CHINESE MANUFACTURING. The shocpad is the biggest blunder of all, it feels like a nail or small rock is under my heal, and it came quite close to crippling me one night at the shopping mall. The velcro also started to shred right before my eyes, in less than 8 months - Do they really make cheaper versions of velcro?  - who knew??? The sole? obviously a cheaper form of rubber, much harder, not as comfortable. This shoe, in less than a year is ready for the trash bin, it looks terrible compared to my old tf1 and tf2. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this version - it's junk.

6305428042|5.0|you know it's halloween when the sanderson sisters pay you a visit! hocus pocus is a CLASSIC, and is my go too movie as soon as the leaves start changing colors, the cooler air rushes in, and october approaches with its promise of halloween! part of the reason this film is so good was it was made during a time when people didn't skimp on these type of films, amazing set design that doesn't look cheesy or fake, great acting, and an all around fun film! you can really tell they put so much time into it! and i wish films today would go back to making such gems. love, love, love!
B007XF0VW2|5.0|I remember seeing the previews of this movie and eagerly awaited it's arrival on blu-ray. This movie rocks! This was by far the party of the year. Anything that could happen, did happen. Great cast of newcomers,hot ladies and plenty of action. A MUST see!
B004FOA84A|1.0|worst game ever not worth your money not even worth a penny to easy it almost made me fall asleep its so hard to get around and its almost impossible to find the right tools
B004XWLN20|5.0|bluray it will be a real deal I love this show though.but I think is kind of expensive for dvd format.
B0018O4YSQ|2.0|With all the great reviews, I thought this would be a great movie to buy for Blu-ray. Well, I was disappointed on both fronts.  Even though I love sci-fi, I did not enjoy the movie.  And, there was nothing spectacular about viewing it on Blu-ray.  Although the movie was definitely not predictable, it was monotonous, boring, and a seriously uninteresting ending that made me feel like I wasted my time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive and really fun!  Whether you're doing a super easy level or something more complex,  it's hard to put it down.
0061730327|4.0|I saw Kamkwamba interviewed on TV and knew I should read the book.  I'm glad I did.  Then I loaned the book to everyone else I thought would be interested and they all enjoyed it.  Yes, parts of the book are kind of depressing, but that is the reality of what this book covers. Overall, it's a wonderful inspiration and very telling!  Read it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was a very fun game I don't think you should earn most of your points by doing sign ups and thc ngs like that but overall great game

145162445X|1.0|(By the way, there are three typing errors, at least, in the book. (a) on p. 59: \\"1905\\"; on p. 111: `Number \\"reative\\" to H' in the lower ordinate; (c) on p. 152: \\"though\\" should be \\"through.\\")<br />(1)I should have given 4 stars to this book because it is good for learning the current status of cosmology, at least for laypeople in physics.<br />Among reviewers giving 1 star, someone recommends Columbia Philosopher David Albert's review in NYTimes. Albert quotes Richard Dawkins from his Afterword to this book: Even the last remaining trump card of the theologian, \\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\" shrivels up before your eyes as you read these pages. If On the Origin of Species was biology's deadliest blow to supernaturalism, we may come to see A Universe from Nothing as the equivalent from cosmology. The title means exactly what it says. And what it says is devastating.<br /><br />Albert makes philosopher's point against the argument of Dawkins and the author regarding the question \\"Why is there something rather than nothing?\\" In my view this question is asking \\"Why does the physical dimension exist rather than non-existent?\\" or maybe asking: \\"How come [physical] existence?\\" which is the first question, out of the three, the late physicist John A. Wheeler posed in 1989/1990. Also this question sounds like asking the teleology of existence, which is a taboo question for physicists. I add my point against the author in (3) below.<br /><br />But one thing I cannot accept Albert is the following point: \\"Who cares what we would or would not have made a peep about a hundred years ago? We were wrong a hundred years ago. We know more now.\\" Is this really so?? The last two sentences obviously reveal the complacency of contemporary scientists. There is a possibility, at least, that, because of this complacency, our mainstream science is advancing on a wrong track, generating more questions than some questions answered, in the search for the fundamental theories, such as the birth of our material world and the origin of life on the earth.<br /><br />(2)What was wrong with us a hundred years ago? To list just a few: (a) Psychical research, Was Sir William Crookes wrong in his experiments with D.D. Home? (b) Vitalism, Was Hans Driesch wrong with his entelechy? (c) Weighing the Soul (instead of the Universe in chap. 2) Experiment, Was Duncan MacDougall wrong with his soul substance? If these scientists were treated as legitimate (as I try to make them so later) a hundred years ago, then we should have been advancing on a quite different track today.<br />(3)Regarding \\"nothingness\\": Religious critics say to the author, You can refer to empty space as \\"nothing,\\" but rather as a \\"quantum vacuum,\\" to distinguish from the philosopher's or theologian's idealized \\"nothing\\"; responding to it the author writes (p. xiv): But what if we are then willing to describe \\"nothing\\" as the absence of space and time itself?<br />Now, the author's response, keeping in mind the idea of Hawking et al. regarding the no spacetime boundary conditions at the beginning of the Big Bang (p. 169), still presupposes something, not anything! That is the \\"quantum\\"; then comes: How come the quantum? This is Wheeler's second question. Andrei Linde, the originator of the eternal chaotic inflation (p.128), expressed his reasoning for the necessity of the quantum in the following expression: \\"Without inflation, our universe would be ugly. Without quantum, our universe would be empty\\" (Linde 2004:454). There is other reasoning for this question based on Wheeler's epitome \\"it (physical reality) from bit (information)\\": the quantization in physics is the same as the quantization of information (Zeilinger 2004:219). Hence, even if the author is willing to describe \\"nothing\\" as the absence of space and time itself, he needs the \\"quantum.\\"<br />(4)Regarding the LHC experiments at the CERN: Had the author published this book in the autumn this year (2012), he would have definitely included the sensational announcement on July 4th of the \\"Discovery of the Higgs Boson\\" by the CERN scientists, a triumph of the Standard Model! In an email exchange with a physicist last March, I wrote that if the CERN scientists have detected the Higgs Boson, it truly means that they have \\"created\\" the particle in the LHC experiment; but they are sure to claim that they have \\"discovered\\" the particle because it should have existed in the Big Bang. I understand that a prediction by a theory and its verifications by experiment, this is the way of a sound science. But still I cast a doubt on the claim because of the following.<br />(5)Regarding the origin of atoms: According to the modern cosmology, as the author writes in the book (p. 17), almost all the atoms whose mass number is larger than 5 or 8 cannot be synthesized during the early expansion phase of the Big Bang universe; these heavier atoms, including C-12, must be created in heavy stars, and distributed in the universe through the supernova explosions.<br />Now, suppose that a lady in Florida, USA, occasionally, spontaneously produces on her body surface a small patch of thin metal foil, which has a similar composition to a Dutch metal (the primary composition of 84% Cu + 16% Zn, looking light golden color, with an excellent ductility). What does this mean, if the supposition is authentic? The answer is that the very supposition is out of question! Then, how could I propose the supposition? Because the philosopher of science, Stephen Braude, reported such a peculiar fact, based on his own field research in Florida, in his book, The Golden Leaf Lady (2007), to which I referred in a paper published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 26, No.1, pp. 9 - 42, 2012: A review of Sir William Crookes' papers on psychic force with some additional remarks on psychic phenomena (this paper concerns (a) in (2) above). And if you read Braude's book, such a peculiar fact is not the only one but there was another, and actually there are many reported in the legitimate psychical research since 1882. What a contradiction between the scientific theory and the peculiar facts! And any peculiar unexplained facts (from the viewpoint of mainstream science) have been always ignored or put on the shelf for the advancement of mainstream science. This is why I don't accept some of Albert's points in (1).<br />(6)Regarding the law of conservation of energy (LCE): Probably, we can safely say that the LCE is an axiom of physics. The author teaches us that \\"something out of nothing\\" in the Big Bang does not violate the LCE. The CERN scientists are cautiously accounting for the balance between the input and out-going energies in the LHC experiments to find an apparent violation of the LCE to claim that they have discovered the \\"dark matter\\" (as the author writes on p. 138) or the extra space-dimension, both of which are unobservable with our current scientific instruments.<br />It should be noted that the plausibility of the LCE rests on the assumption that our physical dimension is a closed system (even the open universe is in this closed physical dimension). My doubt is that \\"Is our physical dimension really closed?\\" I cast the doubt in a paper published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 24, No.1, pp. 5 - 39, 2010: Rebuttal to claimed refutations of Duncan MacDougall's experiment on human weight change at the moment of death (this paper concerns (c) in (2) above).<br />(7)And finally: Quantum theory plays an essential role in this book to justify \\"Something out of Nothing.\\" The author, however, never refers to the third question posed by Wheeler: How come the \\"one world\\" out of many observer-participants? This is not a philosophical question, but an enigmatic physical one since the birth of quantum theory. One can ask that \\"Did the universe exist before the human species evolved through the observation made by a frog?\\" Heisenberg had been always extraordinary: Hence, he, in responding (in ca 1972) to Henry Stapp, is quoted in chapter 13 of Mindful Universe (Stapp 2007): \\"In other words: have these ideas [of Plato] existed at the time when no human mind existed in the world? ... Perhaps we could connect this Platonic idea with pragmatism by saying: It is `convenient' to consider the ideas as existing outside the human mind because otherwise it would be difficult to speak about the world before human minds have existed\\" (Stapp 2007:85). Modern philosophers use the term \\"telepathy\\" when discussing Bishop Berkeley's Idealism. Maybe Wheeler's third question results in \\"Quantum Idealism,\\" a modern form of Berkeley's Idealism! (One may say that the observer problem in quantum mechanics was solved by the theory of \\"decoherence.\\" However, according to Stapp, the principal investigators of the theory make no such strong claim (see Stapp 2007:57-58).<br /><br />I recently posted my review for Sam Harris' Free Will (2012). My conclusion in it: the idea of Free Will becomes an utter illusion, as Harris concludes, only because neuroscientists confine themselves in a closed understanding of the physical dimensions. Probably, the same is true with modern cosmology. Maybe New Ager's mantra is correct: You create your reality based on your beliefs, thoughts, expectations, and feelings & emotions, even in the LHC experiments at the CERN.

B002V091IO|3.0|This book had been highly recommended to me by friends and after all the media hype the film was also awarded, I was expecting much more.<br /><br />I found the story line weak, slow and boring in places.  But I persevered to the end, mostly out of curiosity, so I guess I did 'sort of' enjoy it as I could relate to some of it.  It did not, however, leave much of an impression with me and I was more than ready to move on to my next book.<br /><br />Maybe I am too old, and have lived through too many more romantic and moving real life experiences of my own!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Loved the 1st book, but somehow got a bit tired about half way through Catching Fire. I did finish it, and went on to the 3rd & final book. The entire series is well worth reading. One problem is: after reading The Hunger Games, it is hard to find another book that will keep your interest as well as \\"the Games\\", however Amazon gives you plenty of options...especially if you are using a Kindle.
B000000ORE|4.0|Tesla has been unfairly lumped in the \\"hair metal\\" category at times, solely be cause they came upon the season in the 80's. For that matter, I don't think they ever really got their due: they are as good as any band from that era, and STILL continues to make great NEW music and continues to perform great in concert today.  Additionally, as musicians go, Tesla simply kicks ass.  Melodic AND heavy, Tesla delivers, live and in studio.  The \\"Great Radio Controversy\\" proved that and then some.<br /><br />First, it was the follow-up to a stunning, now-classic debut album, \\"Mechanical Resonance.\\"  So there was the potential that the follow-up wouldn't measure up.  Well, it did, and still does!  You can go back to this album anytime and be reminded of how great the band was and still is.<br /><br />Sound-wise, the album is heavier-sounding than the debut, and you can argue the nearly two years' touring on the first album made their playing heavier - and tighter.  Check out \\"Heaven's Trail\\" and \\"Hang Tough\\" for starters.  But just like the first, there was plenty of melody - and their first truly great ballad in the now-classic \\"Love Song.\\"  This song, with its great build and jam at the end rivals ANY \\"power ballad\\" from the era.  And it STILL holds up.  Other highlights include the heavy-yet-has-an-infectious-chorus \\"Makin' Magic\\", the epic \\"Flight To Nowhere\\" and the simple, anthemic and wonderful \\"The Way It Is.\\" This great song could be a mantra of sorts for Tesla: they deserve to be revered like the Black Crowes, should have sold as many records as Guns N' Roses, but they're successful, loved, and that's \\"The Way It Is\\"
B008JGSM6G|5.0|what a great app!  i love this game and so does my 7 year old!  tons of different levels that get more challenging as they go.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This was a great even tho the media said it was a flop, it had some really good vedia effect's and the story line was to no end.I really loved this movie.
B008MEM24S|5.0|its like where's my water but with a Disney twist. I get a chuckle out of it and my kids LOVE when I play it.<br />so worth a $1!
B00004S367|5.0|The kid was just 21 when he made this in 1972, playing everything, except a solo here or there. Full of retro 70s Motown funk. Awesome, still, to this day. The creativity and invention never flags here. This one kicked off the classic period when he released a series of albums, each one topping the next for genius and creativity. Amazing.
B000ID1J0E|2.0|I have tried to watch this movie several times but, I just lose interest every time and turn it off. The main character, Raoul, as played by Johnny Depp comes off as an annoying little twerp. The story seems to go nowhere. The scene where Raoul is checking in to the Vegas hotel while tripping is well done. The creatures moving in the carpet is a good representation of acid visual distortion. I liked Where the Buffalo Roam more.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game; it works really well on the kindle fire and its really addicting! I recommend this game to everybody!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|\\"Clockwork Angels\\" finds Geddy, Alex and Neil at their most focused since \\"Signals\\" and, as a result, a brilliant modern classic Rush album has been born, thirty years in the making. They've created music this time which is fresh, full of energy and addictive intricate passages. All delivered through such impeccable musicianship. Near-unbelievable experience at this point in time.<br /><br />\\"Caravan\\", \\"BU2B\\", \\"Clockwork Angels\\", \\"Seven Cities Of Gold\\" and the epic \\"Headlong Flight\\" are some of the highlights, although they are just part of a bigger picture for this is an album to be taken in its entirely with attentive ears. It's also a return to a more progressive sound, with a full lyrical concept, which is something I fully embrace and couldn't actually see it coming anymore. Rush seem to be reborn with a new-found purpose, inclined to take chances again.<br /><br />I've got each and every album Rush has put out and I must admit I'm very fond of the classic period, which runs up to \\"Signals\\" as far as I'm concerned. I'll always be moved by absolute gems such as \\"2112\\", \\"Xanadu\\", \\"La Villa Strangiato\\", \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", \\"The Camera Eye\\", to name but a few. No chance for changing here. It just got too difficult to fully enjoy their albums as a whole beginning with \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" - not to say there weren't good songs on those albums, they just got less consistent and unfocused.<br /><br />I also thought \\"Snakes And Arrows\\" was a very positive release, compared to \\"Vapor Trails\\". So, now with \\"Clockwork Angels\\", there's no denying Rush seems to be really back on its feet after such a long period. They rock here with an abandon and power unheard of since the glory days of old. Cheers to that! Getting older doesn't mean getting old and the proof is here. The hours tick away but hope is what always remains to be seen. All is well.

0321544080|5.0|What can I say, I'm a big McNally fan.  His mastery of light is simply amazing.  The premise of the book came from a talk McNally did for Kelby.  Kelby is sitting in the back listening, and being the entrepreneur his is, the lightbulb went off that McNally's lecture was a book in the making.<br /><br />McNally shares advice and learnings he has gotten over the years.  Breaking tradition, it is not all light focused, and McNally shows the breadth of what he has experienced in his photographer lifetime.  You can think of the book as a collection of short stories.  Each story is around a lesson that McNally learned at one point or another.  It translates into an engaging way to share knowledge that does not come off as a lecture.<br /><br />I also read Hot Shoe Diaries.  There was some overlap with that book and the Kelby Training courses that McNally has done.  I didn't see the degree of overlap with this book.
B00129H7VS|5.0|The best films I have seen. By far the best war films ever. The films seem so realistic with amazing sound design, actors, and music. The characters are so well developed to begin to feel attached to them and feel bad when they are injured or killed. Truly an amazing series and a must buy for anyone interested.
B0058PJ6NE|2.0|I do not see any difference between  this version and the free version .  But this is the important part.  THIS APP WILL NOT DOWNLOAD VIDEO.  I STILL use the free version instead of this version.  I do not recommend  buying this app until further notice.

B001VOD5FQ|2.0|First, I LOVE DREAM THEATER. They are my favorite band. Second, I am not reviewing this Dream Theater album as much as I am commenting on the SHM import version from Japan. I have this fetish for remasterings and figure 'people will do better than the original' - so I coughed up the money for this Japanese SHM-CD (and others as to save on shipping). It appears that all they did was to increase the levels on the whole album! Also, this has created a terrible boomy lower midrange while the originals have a tight and punchy sound.<br /><br />I have an audiophile system and can tell you that there is no improvement on the originals. In fact, the originals are textured and nuanced compared to these terrible SHM monstrosities. Save your money and get the domestic releases - they are perfect!!!

1401235166|3.0|Since its inception back in 2002, Bill Willingham's Fables has captivated readers with its sharp, imaginative writing, implausible but believable plots (if that makes any sense), and truly multifaceted, fascinating characters.  The basic premise, of course, is brilliant--take the famous fairy tale and fable figures of yore and set them inside the \\"real\\" world, where they live, roam, and otherwise behave like regular human beings, unless, of course, circumstances dictate otherwise.  And with outside dangers and peril always afoot, circumstances often do.<br /><br />This latest volume, Inherit the Wind, continues Willingham's complicated yarn, with the focus now set on which of Snow White and Bigby's seven cubs will become the new North Wind.  Bufkin's ongoing adventures in Oz also continue to unfold, as does Miss Sprat's evil plan to exact revenge on the Fable community.  Unfortunately, each tale crawls at lethargic speed, and almost smacks of being filler in parts.  Only a foreboding prophesy involving the cubs, and the North Wind's eventual selection, redeem the rather uneventful plot.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the final two chapters fare better, despite having only a cursory connection to the other storylines.  The first follows Rose Red on Christmas Eve as she learns the true meaning of hope, providing a quintessential Fables tale full of philosophical musings, tantalizing questions, and heartfelt sentimentality.  The second is a collection of whimsical short stories of varying quality, but each is entertaining in its own right and one even provides a hint or two of what awaits the Fable people in the future.<br /><br />As for the art, Mark Buckingham's pencil work is merely adequate here, feeling uncharacteristically rushed in parts.  A notable exception is Rose Red's story in chapter five, which features the sharp, lush illustrations for which he's famous.  The final chapter also features solid work by a number of guest artists, but the final piece by Adam Hughes is easily the most striking, with his depictions of Bellflower (and a voluptuous farm girl) being absolutely stunning.<br /><br />Ultimately, Inherit the Wind feels more like a middling prelude to what one hopes will be a weightier story in the next installment.  Readers will probably enjoy what's here, but like eating an appetizer, will still hunger for the main course.  Let's hope the next one delivers.
B0086700CM|4.0|I see that a lot of people are complaining about the lag, but I haven't experienced it. Game runs smooth for me, achieving all the objectives becomes a real challenge. Simple, which is nice; but at times challenging, which is nicer. It's worth the $0.00 that it'll cost you.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|addicted to this lovely game thought I was going yo like it but I do I do. I'm happyni downloaded it
B007JUWM64|1.0|You would think that one director would sit back, look at his work in its entirety, and say: \\"Hey! That's a great film! I feel satisfied in the job I have done, through the art I've perfected.\\" You would think they would do that, but Paul... Webster-Gusterson(Whatever) has given us a new example of how that is not at all a part of film-making, anymore. In this review, I will outline some of the ways that Gary Paulson(Shut up, I know there's a Paul in there) betrayed both the writing of Alexander Dumas and the people of France by simply not thinking about what he was doing... AT ALL.<br /><br />Reason number 1: This isn't resident evil! Be creative and pick another intro!<br /><br />So basically Paul Crackin-bush decided that a ridiculous break-in sequence, with weird character profiles, was a better idea than actually having something interesting that perpetuated the unfolding of a good plot. Instead we deviate away from the book entirely with some crazy Indiana Jones excuse to look at Milla's boobs... Not that I'm complaining. We find out later that what they were stealing was a set of plans for a balloon that does nothing but break the laws of physics in a plot-armor kind of way. But I'll get to that later.<br /><br />Reason number 2: No one cast this film properly or bothered to make the dialect consistent.<br /><br />So for those of you outside of the \\"Biz,\\" movies are usually cast by character type. You match a character type, like a lady from the days of yore, it's usually a safe choice to cast you in exactly that role. Orlando Bloom, in this movie plays the exact opposite of his type, and it shows. In his more successful films(Lord of the Rings, Kingdom of Heaven, Pirates of the Caribbean) He plays pretty much the same character; an quiet youth devoted to a mission, which is a brilliant place to put him. In this he plays exactly the opposite; they try to make him outgoing and evil. I tried to make my paycheck bigger by using white out... but that didn't workeither.<br /><br />This is such a general problem throughout the film, that it really makes me wonder if anyone put any effort into this at all. Even D'artanian's father has a Brooklyn accent. What gives?<br /><br />Reason number 3: Cliches and stolen lines.<br /><br />Every line in this movie either makes no sense or has been stolen from another movie. It's not even subtle, they set up the dialog specifically to use stolen lines like: \\"Anyone who says otherwise is trying to sell you something.\\" We've all seen the princess bride! Constance is snarky for no reason, M'lady says predictable things that still manage to seem out of character; really the script is such a cluster f**k I can't list all of the problems with it.<br /><br />Reason number 4: The flying machine and the fact that Paul Anderson-Smith doesn't know how to use google earth.<br /><br />So this aspect of the movie is so wrong in so many ways, it's really going to be difficult for me to explain in full detail. So in case I miss something, here's a summary: Being in a balloon does not make you go faster, and you cannot travel to London, from Paris, and back in five days by horse and boat! It's impossible and you'd know that if you spent time hitchhiking through Europe, or have spent any time there at all. Even just looking out a plane window you'd be like:\\"Damn, that shit's kinda big. Maybe I should rethink this movie thing... Entirely.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, the main problem comes into play when they make a big deal out of a war machine, that is essentially a ship tied to a balloon(moving target), that Orlando's character has built. It's all wrapped up in secrecy and kept very hush hush until HE LANDS IT ON THE KINGS FRONT LAWN IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM! Guess it's not a secret anymore, guess that opening WAS a complete waste of time, like Blair said. When everyone knows everything about what the threat is, and looks up at it and goes:\\"Hmm... Pretty cool, I want one,\\" watching a movie becomes as tediousas watching a guy work out a complicated mathematical proof.<br /><br />So after this, there's a plot to frame the queen for sleeping with Orlando's terribly unlikable character, by planting some jewels in the tower of London or whatever(I've read the book, and I'm still confused by the motives in this movie). The king tests her by saying: \\"Wear the jewels I gave you, in five days... Cause I want you to be pretty and stuff...\\" She discovers that she doesn't have them and the real plot starts, I guess.<br /><br />So let's do some math!<br /><br />We have five days. It takes them one day to realize and alert the musketeers, so now we have four days. Calais is 181 miles away from Paris, that trip, if you don't want your horse to die before you get there is a good 2 to 3 day trip. Then you cross the English channel and travel all the way to London... Wait... We're already out of time. Guess the queen's been exposed by now, just in the time it took to get there.<br /><br />Do you see what I mean? There's no possible way that this could work at all.<br /><br />Number 5: So the master plan is...<br /><br />Okay so here's the stupid master plan, to get the diamonds back, in the following order:<br /><br />Step 1: Have D'artanian get captured.<br /><br />Step 2: Hijack M'lady's carriage.<br /><br />Step 3: Steal an airship.<br /><br />Step 4: Use the airship to save D'artanian from the arrest that did nothing.<br /><br />Step 5: Hijack M'lady's... um carriage?<br /><br />Step 6: Sail back to France in a balloon.<br /><br />If it was so easy to steal an airship why didn't they just do that. Better still: Why not just wait for m'lady to get in the carriage and gang up on her. Seems much easier and it's only two steps.<br /><br />\\"But Blair, they could only do that stuff because D'artanian was a decoy! Be fair!\\"<br /><br />You mean this fortress exhausted all of the men guarding it to go get D'artanian. That makes even less sense.<br /><br />There are so many more facets of this movie that don't make any sense, I really would die of exhaustion writing all of them down. But really the point of this rant is this: When it comes to making movies like this, you need to make it accurate to give us a reason to care about the tension in the story. This has no attention or care put into it, and is basically garbage shoved onto the screen.<br /><br />The only thing it's good for, at this point, is to supply us with a reason to laugh at the director's expense.
B005UBNKZG|4.0|Had dual core, wanted to upgrade without breaking the piggy bank.  Not sure what to do.  Decided after reading many reviews.  For the price, could not resist this 8 core processor along with purchasing a Gigabyte GA-970A-UD3 motherboard, and 16 gig of memory.  Everything I do on the PC (a lot of photo and video editing) is much faster now.  Ordered on Amazon and arrived in several days, all in great condition.  Installed without a problem.  Overall, very happy with purchase and would recommend to a friend.  I am fan of quiet PCs, and must warn that when the processor gets working and heats up, the stock CPU fan revs up and gets pretty loud.  Doesn't happen often but is a bit louder than I would prefer.
B008OJIBH8|5.0|This exclusive is one of the best out there.  It lights up and plays the theme to E.T. all while lowering the little guy himself.  How could you not love it?  Be the envy of everyone you know by proudly displaying this super cool display case!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Practical and easy to use. No more laptop to download your pictures into your iPad. it was a good investment.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app.  it is sooooooo fun. You run, slide, jump and lean. One of my favs. This is a great app.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I ordered this book on my kindle and started reading it as soon as I saw it on my HOME screen. It costed $9.99. on the kindle and it costed like $20.00 at Barnes & Noble.<br />  I thought that there wouldn't be any pictures in the book since my kindle is older. But then I saw the band together on the second page and it was amaZAYN!!!!<br />  I also wondered how their story would be told since it's five guys and not just one person like Justin Bieber. That's when I saw Harrys name in the beginning and I knew each chapter would be broken down by each guy. They all tell the same story, but from their point of view.<br />  For girls out that love One Direction, please do read this book. It is waaaaaayyyy better than any other biography that you have probably read. Afterwards, you will feel like you have One Direction Infection because I feel like I have it!!!! :D
B005K2XM94|5.0|Like another reviewer, I ordered this case for my Nexus 7. The N7 is a tiny bit longer than the Fire, so the fit is snug but that's probably a good thing. It is certainly easy enough to get in and out of the case, and this case offers excellent protection for the Nexus while bouncing around in my pack. It will only work if your Nexus 7 doesn't have any other sort of case on it - if you put a silicone skin or anything else on it, it would be too tight. I looked at all the cases available locally (Fry's, etc.) and couldn't find anything else that felt this protective, so I'm very happy with the case.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a great for the bordem it is a bordem killer awesome. also good for the kids that are picky.
B008MBXFEM|4.0|I did not notice any issues with gain levels, but I'm not a hard-core audiophile.  I do enjoy lots of orchestral score music, and this seems to be equivalent, in terms of technical production (i.e I don't hear any strange artifacts or warbling or other defects in production).<br /><br />My favorite song, by far, is The Shadows Betray You, which is, for me, the auditory equivalent of having my back broken and being thrown into a nigh-inescapable prison.<br /><br />The rest of the album is good as well.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love icecream and cake it good and I like it temple run is cool I like when you run and jump and fun
B007KOYEOC|4.0|I enjoyed this series of books not a great story line but interesting ideas. The characters were well developed and the threads held just enough interest to keep reading.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The lack of any meaningful updates is seriously disappointing.  This is just a port of the iOS version and not even a good one at that.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey, Season One was wonderful, but, Season Two was even better!!  The twists & turns in the<br />story line made Season Two so intriguing that we couldn't wait to watch the next part.  Once again,<br />the photography, the costumes, and the scenery was first class, we were sad when we came to the<br />end of Season Two & now will have to wait for Season Three, which should be really interesting with<br />the addition of Shirley MacLaine, what fun it will be to see her go head to head with Maggie Smith!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent tool.  I love it. I recommend it to any one wishing for an electronic Bible. I really like being able to view various translations.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is fun &amp; addicting! It is a great way to keep your brain exercising while having fun! love it!
0307949486|5.0|Very interesting story, kept me interested all the way to the end. Am currently in the middle of the second book in the Millennium trilogy and still loving it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This book completely sucks if you are a women in control of what she wants, this is a total male dominance that I was not prepared for I enjoy equality! So this is for the weak women that I am hoping have disappeared by now, I did not enjoy.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Christian Bale makes for an excellent Batman and Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is AMAZING. Not too much violence in this film to be distasteful but just enough for it to be authentic. Not too much romance either, Maggie Gyllenhaal does a very good job as the love interest but not quite as good as Katie Holmes was..Overall an excellent film in actor portrayal of characters and intricacy of plot.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is awesome I totally recomend it. I like how it now has lasers; sludge and Inators like the celebrate-inator. Disney has done it again. My favorite level is Semi aquatic you get it by going to credits and clicking on the duck with a beard! If you don't get this you are missing out on all the fun.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|It amplifies your sound by about 30 percent.<br />small clip on so it fits nicely on shorts ect.<br />i attach it to a bluetooth headset that has low output so it saved that from the trash.<br />it does work but when all linked togeather is a bit large.<br />it holds a charge for a really long time
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is a great game it will keep you busy for hours fun addictive amazing I love it so much get it really soon
B000MM0L2S|3.0|This CD has some amazing redux of Morricone's film themes, especially the Herbie Hancock rendition of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (except for the bizarre solo in the middle). Overall, this is a superb CD. The best take is Metallica's Ecstacy of Gold. Worth purchasing. I have it in my car CD player right now. It's worth the money.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is so fun and I love Perry. The graphics and sounds are well done. Disney never disappoints me.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|My nephew loved it! And I would recommend this to any child 9 and over!!<br />Exactly what was stated and once again great!

B0086700CM|4.0|its a good game and really challenging. the only problem is that sometimes i freezes then makes you lose. some of the objectives need to be explained
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is one of the funniest games I have ever played. I recommend this game to everyone. 5 out of 5 stars
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I had trouble getting through the book. The only reason I finished it is so I could discuss it with my grown daughter. I do not understand anyone writing a book where kids kill kids. If I could have given this book less than one star I would have. It really disturbs me that schools are making this required reading when there are so many other books with redeeming qualities.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I waited a while for this  dvd to come out.  When I received it, boy was it great.  I loved it.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|I love movies about historical figures and think Meryl Streep is fabulous, paired with the Oscar buzz surrounding this film, I was excited for the release of this movie. I didn't know much about Margaret Thatcher prior to watching the movie, only bits and pieces of information as I was a small child during the very end of her term as Prime Minister.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie and while it was slow, still followed along - which, for me is good, as I tend to \\"multi-task\\" through movies and the movie takes the back burner to my task[s]. Meryl Streep was fantastic and she deserved to win for this movie. While this is not a movie that I will pop in again and again, it is worth renting.
1451627297|1.0|I'm not going to write spoilers, but without them I sort of have to beat about the bush. Well why not, he beat every bush in Texas and Maine to get to the end.<br /><br />To describe this book as slow would be to miss on opportunity to really describe the grinding sameness of most of this book. Does this guy ever need an editor who can tell him when he's been following one snail for too long. In some ways it's like a school kid essay, \\"what I did this summer: after the bell went I picked up my pen and put it in my pocket. Then I closed my (insert long winded description of book) notebook. Then I closed my (précis of well known novel) book. Then I put them in my (long description of bag) bag. Then I stood up. Then I turned towards the door. Then I stepped from my desk. Then I walked to the front. Then I turned to the door. Then I walked to the door. Then I opened the door. Then I stepped through the door. Then I closed the door...\\" And I've left some out.<br /><br />I had the particular misfortune to listen to the audio book version. I got it to fill in the long drives on a road trip. Last time we did this was with The Talisman, in that case we were always getting back in the car to get on with the story. This time after two days my other half advised that she would rather take the bus than listen to any more. The grindingly slow delivery. The over emotional reading of over emotional prose. Oh Lord Help Me!<br /><br />I can't go on. I don't want to re-live the boredom and irritation.<br /><br />I know a lot of people really like this book, and a significant number really really don't. Also bear in mind that part of my problem was with the audio book reading style. If you are only going to comment that you disagree then please save yourself the time, my reply would be that you can't please all the people all the time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|overall a good experience for free app. have to figure out how to skip ads as not all have uniform way to skip
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My  boyfriend  really  liked this  mivie even though it is  a kids movie.  I loved it  and I did  cry

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app!!!!! I can write myself notes....enter info into my calendar...cross out accomplishments...and simply organize my scurried life....Thank-you for answering a much needed need....
B007J4T2G8|1.0|By far the worst book I've ever read.  Poor, poor writing, lack of character development and an inability to even try to relate to the main character made it difficult to finish. I got the impression that the author picked a few words out of the thesaurus and used them repeatedly.  Also, the \\"smut\\" angle (the only reason I decided to read it) was so lacking I was skipping pages by the middle.  Seems that maybe this book only appeals to those with boring sex lives or those who don't watch enough porn.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I play Ice Age Village all the time.  Love this game, my daughters love to play with me, they likened to hunt for Scratt.
0440243688|3.0|This is my first Lee Child's novel and I listened to it on CDs. read by Dick Hill, a favorite storyteller for me. There's already many descriptions of the Jack Reacher series so I offer none. I will say the book is a fun, fast pace, quite the super hero. I truly couldn't run down those streets or live in shabby conditions as Reacher, but all in all, it's a bigger than life guy who is fighting terrorism. Lee Child is a good writer and Dick Hill, once again, mastered the main character. Think I'll read another of Mr. Child's novels.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I just wanted to rate the app so they will make more updates because it is very fun the end
034580404X|5.0|This series is exciting and full of suprises!  Keep an open mind when reading it! I had a hard time puting it down!  It is an easy read...
1400079276|5.0|Is it possible to say, \\"This is Murakami at his best\\"?  If so, then this is it for me.  The characters in the book are so richly drawn that one feels that one can nearly predict what they are going to say or feel next.  Of course that is what one feels; but not so true.  How could you predict that Nakata can talk to cats; but , of course, not all cats and it is not clear which cats he can communicate with.  For that matter, there is another character who is richly drawn as a very kind young man who is of doubtful sexual identity.  The characters turn on the plot which is also impossible to predict.  The book feels surreal and yet plot and people do make sense after a while.  I loved this book.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Without really knowing what this book/movie was truly about, I watched at the mercy of my mother (I really wanted to see it but just didn't have the time) and I was so thankful to my mom!<br />This movie conveys such an incredible and amazing story about these women breaking a social barrier, creating a new standard, and teaming up in a way men think is \\"the woman way\\" but what men really call a \\"rally.\\"<br />This is intimate, personal, building, growing, loving, and entirely woderful. Characters grow, they persevere, and they come together. If you do not love this movie, you're either lying or you are trying to hide something.<br />Let go and love.
B005IQZB14|5.0|\\"Wild\\" is a wonderful story and very well written. I was sobbing by the end of the first chapter, but don't let that stop you from picking up this wonderful book. It sets the stage for a meaningful, harrowing, funny and exciting adventure.  Strayed writes completely from the heart in the most open and vulnerable way. She's funny, she's got depth and most of all, she's got that big open heart. Her adventure is remarkable and it's impossible to not imagine what you would do under similar circumstances. Highly recommend.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|I saw the Dark Knight without seeing Batman Begins simply because I was curious and I needed something. I was blown out of my movie-seeing brain! At the urge of the man (who wasn't present when Dark Knight came out) we saw Dark Knight Rises. It was NOT THAT GREAT. If I had to tell someone to only see one, I'd say see Dark Knight because it is non-stop suspense and intensity with so many twists and unpredictable spins you're still thinking about it. The Dark Knight Rises is predictable, looooooooong, and leaves so many open ends Christopher Nolan is lying through his 5 layers of fat that this \\"trilogy\\" is over. You cannot end this on a weak note. See Dark Knight. If you choose to be fulfilled, see Batman Begins, Dark Knight Rises (not cuz it's better, cuz you need the history), then Dark Knight. Don't save this til last, but save the 3 hrs if you plan on it. It's really not the best
0439023521|5.0|i love this story.  i wanted to see the film but wanted to read the book first, so i could really see the author's unaltered viewpoint before watching it.  it has kept me captivated from the beginning:)
B00701L5XS|4.0|Easy to use and fun to play with.  This covers 71 knots that range from basic to combos.  The program would be better if the knots that are referenced were all diagrammed as well.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a good game to play when you are bored. it is also somewhat entertaining to play when you are at home or on the go
B003W2RG78|5.0|Gene Hackman was brought to the attention of moviegoers in [[ASIN:B00124O0GI BONNIE AND CLYDE]] (1967), but it was this Oscar performance in William Friedkin's THE FRENCH CONNECTION that made him a star. (Also won statuettes for Best Director, Picture, Screenplay and Editing.)<br /><br />Based on a real NYPD narco case and detective Eddie Egan, as portrayed by Hackman, Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle is a loose cannon in a porkpie hat. His nearly rabid pursuit of drug-smuggling \\"Frog #1\\" (Rey) comes to naught at this one's close, setting up a not-as-good sequel. (TRIVIA: In Egan's cameo as Walt Simonson, he gives Popeye a \\"dig\\" by repeating Doyle's favorite interrogation gimmick, the feet picking question.)<br /><br />Use of soundtrack music here is unique. In the film's most action-packed scenes, there's NONE. Somehow this lack of blaring music works great.<br /><br />Of historical note: the Bensonhurst Elevated Railway train that Doyle pursues in a commandeered auto is a last survivor of an extensive system built in the 1870s by Robber Baron Jay Gould. (MORE TRIVIA: During this electrifying chase sequence, a real collision occurs with another car, driven by a man going to work.)<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.9) The French Connection (1971) - Gene Hackman/Fernando Rey/Roy Scheider/Tony Lo Bianco/Marcel Bozzuffi/The Three Degrees
B006OCM0G0|3.0|okay here's the thing its a fun game until it put me on someone else's account that really piss's me off
B008JGSM6G|4.0|the game is not too bad! it can be addicting but also very frustrating!!! good time waster but an even better time waster would be song pop
B005ZMTYTQ|3.0|This is an ok free movie.  It includes all the elements of a high school drama with a bit of super powers in the high school aged hero.  It also contains sort of scary alien bad guys... good looking high school alien hero, nerd outsider whose (missing/dead) dad spent all his time traveling around trying to prove star people visited earth... and the kid is also a card carrying member of same... it also, of course, contains the school QB/bully and his Lois Lane cutie ex  who of course falls for the nice alien boy.  The bad aliens are kind of comic book/halloween  tatted up 2 meter tall cretins with guns and the need to kill
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|I read all the books as a child and was a little concerned that the movie would be a big disappointment. However, I found the movie to be interesting and enjoyable. Even my husband, who had not read the books so had no frame of reference, enjoyed it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|where's my Perry is the best game ever o love it you have to pay on the kindle I now that and I bet you will love the game too.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|I never write music reviews.  But after listening this one, I am floored.<br />Background: I've been a fan of Anthrax since State of Euphoria (saw the video \\"Indians\\" on MTV's original headbanger's ball).  When the band grabbed John Bush, I felt like it was killing 2 good bands (ruining both Armored Saint's rise and Anthrax).<br />Since Anthrax split ways with Belladonna, I thought the their albums were just....ok.  I am so sad sorry that I only just heard this album.  The music on this is as good as (if not better than) some of their earliest work.  from start to finish, the songs are so good that I have to wonder if Anthrax made a deal with the devil (selling their souls to make [arguably] one of the best metal album to come along in a while).
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is a simple and sleek case. It offers some protection without being too bulky (perfect for throwing in your bag and not worrying about it). It installs easily and snugly.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars, but the stand up feature takes a little getting used to to get it just right. (You have to pay special attention to make sure that the entire length of the cover is inserted into the slot.)
0345803485|5.0|Best boook ever, i have ordered all three and love the condition they were in.
0838577016|5.0|Great book for introduction to neuroscience. It's technical but also dives into subjects like consciousness and artificial intelligence.  For upper level psychology students only.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I have not enjoyed a game this much in a long time.  I am not particularly good at puzzles, but I only had to resort to a cheat site for one of them (the flower box).  The other puzzles were just right --not too hard, not too easy.  And the artwork was so beautiful that it was fun just to wander around the landscape.  I can't wait for the next new Fire Maple game!
0061684384|5.0|this book is simply amazing! i absolutely love it! it is in perfect condition, and is exactly what i wanted. just fabulous.

B00004SVID|5.0|I personally think Pink Floyd the Wall Live beats the studio version with extreme predigest! It sounds better and gives a better vibe. I was SO happy to finally find another copy (wore the old disk out lol) This seller got it to me fast and in great condition. Since it was used it skipped once but it was fixed easily with a good cleaning :) Thank You for such a wonderful product!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is an amazing game although it is very well addicting I would recommend it to everyone great I would lt everyone
B0058VW36U|3.0|Pro:<br /><br />Looks great on Kindle fire.<br /><br />Some levels are fun, with clever mechanics.<br /><br />Con:<br /><br />Touch screen interface kind of sucks. If elements overlap, like a bubble to hold the candy in and a little air fan you press to activate, you tend to do the wrong one. It's also a little imprecise with small movements.<br /><br />Level unlock sucks. You need to get a certain amount of stars to open each box, but around the fourth box it gets fairly high. Either you'll be replaying a lot of levels to try and get all three stars, or you'll give up and shelve the game or pay to unlock them all via MT I guess. I don't mind it if I were skipping many levels, but I'm not.<br /><br />Greased pig mechanics get annoying. By greased pig I mean this game is built around imprecision and inertia, so you do a lot of replaying till you find the correct way of doing it. Especially with puzzles where you need to cut tense ropes at the right time to get any stars at all.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Not bad, but I bought it, and the cons make me shelve it very easy. A great app to showcase the Kindle Fire screen, and for light playing, but too annoying for me for sustained play.
B006TGWY3K|5.0|I've been letting this album harmonize my inner ear so often it's almost sexual.  Their cover of REM's 'Losing My Religion' was a great refresh that sounds both nostalgic and new.  Listen to the album in order-- it's very well laid out, ending in the 6-minute audio orgy that is 'MySpirt.'  I'm to purchase the album version once I'm state-side just to have another copy.  I was seriously afraid that Lacuna Coil would have lost their steam by now.  But no, they keep making love to my ears and I'm afraid I'm impregnated with their music.
B004EPYZSK|3.0|I truly wanted to enjoy this action flick, but find myself just wanting the predictable story to come to an end. I did not like any of the characters and did not care what happened to them. What can they expect when they did not even take the time to develop any of them? It turns out the the most likable was the barkeep. He was the only one even remotely interesting. The story failed on every level as it presented a predictable plot with zero twists. If you did not see the 'reveal' coming from the very beginning, then you must be a complete idiot. I give this jumbled mess three stars though for a few reasons. Some of the visuals were pretty cool, though the aliens themself were humdrum typical (except for their tiny hands).  Secondly, the lack of a true Hollywood happy ending made me smile.<br /><br />The fact is, Schlockywood needs to understand that not all comics, or graphic novels, translate to the big screen. I really expected better from the crew behind this film. Maybe I'm still too jaded from Spielberg and Ford ruining Indy with their last film flop. Wait, that one was about amazingly similar, uninspired aliens too.<br /><br />I just have to say again, I really wanted to like this movie. Sad.
B005HSL626|5.0|A very addicting game. You start to crave fruit as you play. You unlock cool backgrounds and fun blades.You will really like it.
B003UYV08E|5.0|This film was a true worthy follow-up to one of the best superhero films of all time. Inspired by the storyline from the late 80s 'Armor Wars' arc, Iron Man 2 has our hero fighting against his invention being weaponized while at the same time fighting those who are stealing his tech. There is no one who can pull off Tony Stark like Robert Downey Jr. His portrayal is worth watching even if he never dons the suit. This is good, because Iron Man gets very little screen time against his alter ego in this installment. A perfect precusor to Avengers and Thor, with a slight nod to Captain America.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|this app is totally cool. the best app that I have downloaded on my kindle yet. I recommend this game to everyone. easy and fun to use!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I usually don't have a hard time classifying a book, yet I had a hard time placing this book in a genre. I ended up going with Young Adult Urban Fantasy, although it doesn't really 100% fit the UF profile. I guess it's a combination of UF, Fantasy and maybe even a hint of historical fiction.<br /><br />I liked this book more than I expected. There is time travel, supernatural beings, and even a bit of mystery. Ymbrynes, wights, hollowgast, and the peculiar children themselves. All beings that I hadn't read about before, which, I my opinion, makes this book really original! It's a nice change of pace.<br /><br />In the beginning I couldn't really tell where the book was going. First I thought \\"Wow, this is a different twist on things,\\" Then I thought, \\"Woah, his grandfather made up all of those stories??\\" Then I was back to, \\"Is this real, or is Jacob dreaming?\\" I was all over the place for about the first half the book. Then things clicked into place with more explanations and it became pretty apparent that indeed the Miss Peregrine and her peculiar children were indeed real in this story.<br /><br />I liked Mr. Riggs writing style. The pace of the book was consistent and it was easy to read. I also liked that it was narrated from Jacob's POV. It's been a long time since I've read a book from a male perspective. Jacob and Emma are interesting characters and I found that I enjoyed their interactions. It was a little odd knowing that a 88 year old Emma (even in a child's body) was into 18 year old Jacob, But then again, it's not so different from any other vampire book, where the vampire is sometimes centuries older than their human counterpart. At first, I did think that Emma liked him as a replacement for what she lost with his grandfather, but eventually you could tell Emma genuinely liked Jacob for himself and it had nothing to do with replacing his grandfather.<br /><br />I even liked Miss Peregrine. She was mysterious, secretive and had some witty things to say. I liked reading about the history of the peculiar children and how Jacob's grandfather was a part of it. I also though tit was pretty clever how the author wrote on how the peculiars hid in plain site, sometimes as a part of those traveling circuses with the talent who could do weird things.<br /><br />One thing that I didn't really care for is the parental interaction in the book.  It was a little odd. Almost like they had no real purpose in the book.  I really felt that as even though Jacob is 16, his parents should have sent him alone...(Yes, that sounds crazy). But I say that because there was really no need for the supervision, because there really was none.  His dad was just taking up space in the story. Even though his father's history with his grandfather needed to be noted, over all his story-line was a mute point. In the end, he ended up taking off on his own anyways.<br /><br />Beyond the story. I really enjoyed the various photos throughout the book, they added a little something extra. At the end of the book, the author writes that all the photos, including the cover photo are authentic and vintage. That pleasantly surprised me, I initially thought they were created just for the book. That's actually pretty cool and a little bit weird.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you like fantasy and are looking for something different to read.<br /><br />A few if my favorite quotes from Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children:<br /><br />\\"At times, young man, you tread a precariously thin line between being charmingly headstrong and insufferably pigheaded.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sometimes it's better not to look back.\\"<br /><br />\\"Forgive me. I continue to underestimate the breadth of your ignorance.\\"<br /><br />\\"When someone won't let you in, eventually you stop knocking.\\"I liked reading about the history of the peculiar children and how Jacob's grandfather was a part of it.

B003K15IF8|5.0|I highly recommend this book. The moving story of an everyday's man.<br />It is beautifully written and it is impossible not to feel identified with Professor Stoner and his decisions.<br />The chapter about the graduate  examination should be read by every college and professor
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I have read the \\"triology\\" now, and I really don't understand what all the hype was about. I don't know if it's that I don't have such a closed mind on the things that happened throughout the book, or just thought that the main charactor \\"Christain\\" had some \\"issues\\" that he really needed to get over, or if this was the only life that this character knew.<br /><br />After reading the three books, I must say that it was pretty swift on the author to make sure that one book lead into the next book so that you HAD to purchase the next book to find out what was going to happen next.<br /><br />Even though I DID find spelling errors and grammar errors through the books, I didn't think that the story was awful, besides the explicid sexual content, the story itself was alright.<br /><br />It's too bad that the media did such a terrible job about giving all this hype, but I found that it was mostly \\"older\\" women that were more shocked over the content than the \\"younger\\" folk.<br /><br />As always, the story came to a good ending.
B005OJTVMK|5.0|I freaking love this thing!! The color is amazing. It's super compact so it doesn't make my kindle look bulky.
B00785P2QC|5.0|super addicting and fun! reminds me a lot of Sim city. brings that classic back to life all over again! download this game
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Does a good job for cell phone pics. I would have problem recommending to others.  The best app I have seen for editing photos on a cell phone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good till update ok after though to all around ok good for takers! I though it was ok,  good for passing time
B000FA5SMK|4.0|As always Nelson DeMille gives you a good  read.  Always like his books and will cont to inform other people to read his books.  This one was very good.
B006LSZECO|3.0|As i first started reading I thought \\"wow what a great book\\". The ending made it a waste to read. i think the writer got tired of writing. I gave the book 3 stars because it was good until the end...
B008JH5FZ6|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was very similar to Escape from New York, but cooler and in space.<br /><br />Must watch for any action flick or sci-fi geeks out there.
0062197258|5.0|I was thrown briefly at the beginning because of the alternating time periods but that technique quite worked for me.  The almost exact four year difference for the first part of the story was a key factor for me.  Also the foreshadowing in the prologue warning us that June 13, 2004 was going to be pretty rough kept me well aware of the dating of each sequence.  The portrayal of Lee was especially chilling as you slowly become aware of his abusive nature.  The gullibility of the one friend of the main character was yet another expert touch.  And the ending produces the chill intended by the author.  Truly a great read.<br /><br />This was amazing for a first novel and I'll be anxious to see the next.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it has the option to change letter size and mark your favorites sections and reading plans are awesome. Last update fixed many things and looks great. I would love to have the option to download Nvi in Spanish and having plans not calendar attached. just something to tell me what should I read every time I get in. to continue learning from the Bible.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I have never written a review before, but I felt I must about Fifty Shades of Grey. I couldn't put the book down, it draws you it to every part of it. It is definitely for women and men who have forgotten what lust is. I purchased the next two books Darker and Freed before I had finished it, I just didn't want to stop reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hard to put down this action packed book - first sifi book in a long time, might be reading more soon.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this app and so does my little sister. I just wish that their would be more levels than their is. that's why I gave it 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its fun but you have to use too many coins just to get the next level. Other than that, its a fun free game.

B000022TSY|1.0|I AM OVER 65 AND WHEN I GOT THE DVD I WAS A LITTLE BIT DISAPOINTED. IT´S A TIPICAL MOVIE SHOWING  THE MENTALITY 45 YEARS AGO. I ONLY PURCHASED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I HAVR A HARLEY AND REMEMBERED THAT ONCE A GO THERE WAS THIS MOVIE AND I WANTED TO SEE IT AGAIN. FOR ME MOVIE HAS NO ARGUMENT.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have spent the last few days playing flow non-stop. It is a lot of fun and a good challenge.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its awesome. I love love love it.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I play it all the time I like the brave one to
B007WULJ5G|4.0|Whenever I go to Magic Mountain, I always start at one of the smaller coasters to get myself ready for the larger coasters. A Serbian Film is one of those movies you have to work yourself up to. If you've seen the Saw movies, Faces of Death series or actual torture footage, you might be ready. If I had seen the EDITED version, I would have thought it was an interesting story, well-shot with a bizarre twist at the end. The problem with the UNCUT is that the scenes that remain are dynamite blasts in a world of gunfire. They not only steal the show, they misplace the peaks and draw away for the dramatic base of the film.<br /><br />Do I recommend this film? As I state in the title of this review, you cannot unwatch this film. It takes you to a place that some may not be comfortable going. So, watch at the own risk. The good news is there a digital copy included, so you can take it anywhere.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I just wanted to say thanx to all of the people who hare this game. fist game was fun till the developers sold their souls to glue. this is my third review Cuz they wouldn't post my others. anyways thanx<br />svz Sufis.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game I'm totally addicted. I play everyday. there are a few bugs here and there but gameloft seems to get them fixed quickly.
0316098337|4.0|I was skeptical about reading this book at first and concerned it would be too dark and that I would not enjoy it from a 5 year old's perspective, but I was wrong. This book was a tender and really unique read. I especially like the first half to two-thirds when mother and son were trapped together and then conspired to escape. After they were out in a more \\"normal\\" environment I guess I thought it would be more positive, but it probably reflects real life accurately. I would recommend this book.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I love this app my kindle never runs low on battery u need to try it :) its a very helpfull app
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|very hard sometimes but entertaining!<br /><br />I like it a lot. l recommend it to everybody.<br />there is no easy game there
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. I'd highly recommend it!<br /><br />Told from 2 different points of view which I enjoy. Suspensful.
B00164KYV4|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, and there's not much more I can say about it! DVD is great quality, and for $5.00, you can't get much better than this.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|I purchase this with my kindle fire. It works well as a protective case /cover but the stand is so flimsy and weak. I start pushing on the keys while it is \\"standing\\" and with one tap, it collapses! Plus, when you attempt to use the stand, most of the time it collapses as soon as you stand it up. I wouldn't recommend this protective case. At best, the stand is good for watching videos or Tv shows and movies. I plan on getting one of the leather protective cases soon.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I am not a fan boy of Linkin Park but this album is definitely a step ahead of A Thousand Suns. I did not enjoy that album what so ever. There were a few good songs, but I feel Living Things is twice better. For $5 you can't go wrong, I'd say 8 of the twelve songs on this album are classics. Mind you there is one song \\"Tinfoil\\" that is just a Prelude to the final song my favorite \\"Powerless\\". I feel this song alone is worth my $5. Overall if your an LP fan you should enjoy this album, I know I have been since I purchased it on release day :-)
0380804557|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie Stardust and so I ordered the book.  Being a fan of fantasy lit. and a comic book collector in my youth, I appreciated the novella immensely.  Gaiman's writing is well-crafted and brought to life in Vess' fantastical images.  Sky pirates fishing for lightning, brilliant!  While the movie deviates from the book in both plot and tone, I enjoy both and highly recommend this read.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I loved this book!! He is one of my favorite authors!! Nice surprises!! He never lets me down!!  Favorite book of the summer!!

B005ES0XQY|5.0|I was looking for something other than flip flops to slip on for working in the yard or quick trips to the store.  Finally got to try some Crocs.<br /><br />Sizing is a little tricky. I'm 10.5 mens.  10 in Duet Plus was too tight, so I got these in an 11.  At first I thought they were too big, but am used to them and think they're just right.<br /><br />What I like about these, in order from what I like most:<br /><br />-PERFECT for slipping on for chores or running around. They are convenient, protect my feet, and help keep my heels from cracking. Tough enough for serious yard work.<br /><br />-FEEL great.  Lots of cushion.  Room for long 2nd toes.  They are easy to keep on with the straps up or back.<br /><br />-NICE for WALKING.  Decent arch support.  Remind me of the Earth Shoes I wore in the 70's---enable a smooth, rolling movement and all of the toes can spread and contribute to pushing off.  I was pleasantly surprised by how nice they are to walk in.<br /><br />-GOOD GRIP, even on wet, smooth concrete.  Very secure---unlike sandals & flipflops, which are like ice skates when wet.<br /><br />-EASY to wash.  No more rotten-smelling exercise sandals or cloth slip-ons that trap skin & funk. They even float!<br /><br />What I don't like (minor issues):<br /><br />-CLAMMY feeling in humid weather.  However, not as bad as I feared for a plastic shoe...they do breathe.<br />-UGLY.  Yup.  I'm still not buying \\"they're so ugly they're cute.\\"  These look better than some other styles. But, hey, they're clogs!<br />-PRICE.  They're a little steep (Duet Plus were much less expensive). But I'm glad I bought them.<br /><br />These are great for what I bought them for.  I'll surely shop for Crocs again when the time comes.<br /><br />REVISED 8/01/12<br /><br />Added a star-from 4 to 5. I find myself wearing these more and more. Exactly what I was looking for.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable is necessary if you want to connect Kindle Fire to a computer. Not all of them come with it. It is a necessity for me and is great.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it can't put it down. would love more interaction with characters . just love this. game. got all my friends hooked
B007ANGYV4|4.0|Four stars instead of five are given because of the translation.  I originally read this book when it was translated into English by a Swedish fan who had a vast knowledge of the football world, Zlatan, and the English language.  This \\"official\\" English translation is obviously written by a Brit and it loses some of the flair of how Zlatan talks (can you imagine Zlatan referring to other men as \\"blokes\\"???).<br /><br />The book itself is brilliant.  It's one of the best autobiographies I've ever read, and a MUST-READ for every Ibrahimovic fan.  It reads like Zlatan talks, but unlike most of his interviews, the book gives details about and insight into what really happened during various stages in his career.  Most fascinating to me were the details of minute-by-minute negotiations during various transfers and Zlatan's opinions about his many coaches.  Equally intriguing is Zlatan's descriptions of some of his key matches, best goals and dealings with National team members.<br /><br />Seriously, if you are an Ibrahimovic fan, you have to buy this book.  If you hate Ibrahimovic, you have to buy this book.  And if you care at all about football (aka: soccer), you have to buy this book.  In sum, you have to buy this book.<br /><br />Update 10/26/13:  Several people have responded to my comment, asking where they can get my translated version of the book.  The translation I originally read was simply a communication from one fan to another, after I had some friends in Sweden purchase the book (they had to go to 10 different book stores to find it!) for me and bring it back to the US.  I probably should never have mentioned it.  I also purchased the ipad app of the book, which is, I think, the same as this \\"new\\" English-language version of the book but without the interactive features of the app.  Again, I have not yet purchased this new version of the book.<br /><br />If I had never read my Swedish friend's translation, I would have given this book 5 stars.  It truly isa brilliant read, whether or not you are a Zlatan fan or even a football fan.  It's an interesting, funny and REAL look into the evolution of a modern sports hero. It's been short-listed for the William Hill sports book of the year award!<br /><br />I've been reading other football books lately, and if you're interested in a laugh-out-loud satire of English football, check out Terry Ravenscroft's \\"Football Crazy.\\"  It's absolutely hilarious! If you're an Amazon Prime member, I think you can even rent this book for free in the lender library.
B003L77GGK|5.0|This TV show for horror fans contains excellent writing; is extremely entertaining to watch and is great fun!  Just as I expected.
159420229X|5.0|Author made a non-interesting sport/competition intersting and gives good explanation of how memory works and devices you can use to help memorize things. I suggest not reading this as a way to improve your memory but read it as a form of information entertainment.
B007BVOF8E|4.0|This is a film about people thinking.  And researching.  And thinking some more.  And listening.  And thinking.  If that sounds boring, skip this.  You'll enjoy something else more.  That's not a knock; everyone has different tastes.  Gary Oldman, who does most of the thinking and listening, was a revelation.  Benedict Cumberbatch, who does most of the research and some of the thinking, also handled his part well.  All of the character actors were excellent from John Hurt to Toby Jones to Tom Hardy.  There wasn't a false note, and the Circus -- the building and the agency -- became a character as well.  The character relationship between Bill Hayden and Jim Prideaux is heart breaking, and Colin Firth and Mark Strong do a wonderful job.  For those who remember the Cold War, this movie is a must.
B008MEM24S|5.0|love this game so much it is like where's my water, but this is cooler because it has Perry the platypus in it.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is really fuzzy.but it is a good game.I play it a lot.you should buy it.I love it when apps are free.
B000001FKY|5.0|There's something about the '80s that tends to scream '80s, whether it's hair, architecture, or music.  Not a lot from that era stands out as particularly timeless.  That isn't a bad thing at all, because the '80s were a truly awesome decade.  However, some things came out of the '80s that stand on their own as really quite exceptional.  I give you Exhibit A: Def Leppard's Hysteria album.<br /><br />This is as much a masterpiece today as it was when it first hit stores back in 1987.  Some might associate many of the singles with the Class of '88, or with the heyday of the enclosed shopping mall, or with blasting the radio in a shiny new Trans Am, but the music sounds fresh 25 years later and, frankly, fresher than almost any rock music to come along at any time since then.  Yes, Def Leppard is a hair band.  Yes, they rocked arenas in the '80s.  But they set themselves apart from the rest of the genre, upping the ante with tight harmonies, deep chord progressions, and hooks that could catch three blue whales at once.  Today we can listen to a song like \\"Cherry Pie\\" by Warrant or \\"Talk Dirty to Me\\" by Poison, or any number of hair metal songs, and yuk it up at how totally '80s they sound, but listen to something like \\"Love Bites\\" by Def Leppard and one doesn't think of it as an '80s song: instead it's this beautiful anthem for anguish, and it transcends time.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint Def Leppard was and is superior to probably any band of its ilk, but it goes beyond their musicianship.  Rick Allen is one of the best drummers in the world, and he makes all that noise with one arm.  It takes a lot of heart and determination to overcome losing an arm and still be part of one of the greatest bands of all time.  Subsequent to Hysteria, they lost Steve Clarke, one of their guitarists who was such a significant part of their sound.  Through adversity Def Leppard has continued to tour and record.<br /><br />Then there is the songwriting.  Def Leppard's bread 'n'butter was never the cookie-cutter verse/chorus/verse/chorus baby food that so many bands at the time spooned out to their fans.  The Lep sliced, diced, sauteed, and flambeed, and then set the table with linens and fine china.  An examination of the construction of their songs shows that there were typically three separate melody lines and three separate sets of chords within a song, transitioning through the cycle a couple of times before taking it for a spin across the bridge, eventually coming back to at least two of the three melodies.  It's a formula that works because musical themes within a song recur just enough to be catchy and memorable without being repetitive.  It's like a tease that leaves the listener wishing it was.  This was a tactic that Def Leppard hit us with back on Pyromania with \\"Photograph,\\" a song which foretold of what to expect on Hysteria.<br /><br />In several ways Hysteria was unprecedented.  Def Leppard and \\"Mutt\\" Lange took advantage of the fact that one year earlier CDs outsold vinyl and cassettes for the first time, and decided to give Hysteria more than an hour's length.  Two of the tracks are over 6:30 long, including the non-radio edit of \\"Rocket.\\"  The shortest track is \\"Animal,\\" clocking in at a robust 4:02.  Seven of the twelve tracks were released as singles, six of which went on to become major hits.  To release literally more than half of the tracks to radio is practically unheard of.  This was also the band's first album since Rick Allen's accident, and by far their most successful.  It was three years in the making, with much of the initial recording scrapped due to band members' creative frustration and overall dissatisfaction.  Following their intuition proved to be a wise move, because what they ultimately came up with was one of the great landmarks in rock history.<br /><br />This was the album that spawned their biggest hit, \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me,\\" a song that lead singer Joe Elliott refers to in the liner notes ofthe Vault compilation as \\"pure sex.\\"  Few songs from the '80s continue to get the airplay today that \\"Sugar\\" does.  Hysteria opens with its lead single, \\"Women,\\" putting the listener right into a groove that remains largely consistent throughout the album.  \\"Women\\" was never the hit it sounds like it should have been, with its driving grind and sense of mystery.  It did set the tone for what followed, and that is perhaps more important than chart position.<br /><br />\\"Animal\\" is one of those songs that propels itself along on the strength of a chugging bass line, soaring guitars and calculatedly placed rhythm guitar.  No better soundtrack to freeway driving has ever been composed.  (\\"Armageddon It\\" and Pyromania's \\"Photograph\\" do have that same effect of making one want to blow past the other cars on the freeway, though.)  One of the all-time great songs of any era is \\"Hysteria.\\"  This goes into that wonderful eighth-note bass line category with \\"Animal\\" and \\"Photograph,\\" with a melody as satisfying as a sweet-and-salty snack.  It has the added benefit of being the least sappy love song ever written.  It's a perfect marriage of lyric and music.<br /><br />Probably the album's best non-single cut is \\"Gods of War,\\" the second-longest track on Hysteria.  Naturally bands don't want to tip their entire hand and release all their best stuff as singles, but \\"Gods of War\\" is a long song and too good in its entirety to edit.  It's actually more melodically and lyrically compelling than the two-seconds-longer \\"Rocket\\" which did just fine with much of the bridge edited out.  Sometimes it's tempting to say, \\"That should've been a single; it's an awesome song!\\" but people are always disappointed when an album is nothing but singles and filler.  \\"Gods of War\\" scratches that itch.  To a lesser degree \\"Don't Shoot Shotgun\\" and \\"Love and Affection\\" serve the same purpose.<br /><br />All the great songs aside, Hysteria isn't without its blemishes.  Despite Def Leppard having their inimitable sound, they fall into the trap of recording a couple of generic hair-metal songs.  \\"Run Riot\\" gets away with it a little easier thanks to an instrumental bridge and the way the song is arranged technically, but Elliott's vocals on the verses in particular come across as standard-issue arena rock.  It helps soften the blow that the title track wastes no time in following \\"Run Riot.\\"  The song that gets a little less love here is \\"Excitable,\\" not only because it is interchangeable with any run-of-the-mill sex-themed hair-metal song of the day, with almost a New Wave sound to the guitars that Def Leppard doesn't usually make, but because of its placement immediately after \\"Hysteria.\\"  It's like being sound asleep and having someone suddenly turn a light on.  Or like having the best tiramisu for dessert, and then being offered yesterday's bread with no olive oil to go with it.  Not so much anticlimactic, but certainly it makes you go, \\"What the hell?!\\"<br /><br />Still, even with a pair of songs that elicit a \\"meh,\\" the majority of Hysteria is so brilliant, the album gets five stars.  Most Def Leppard fans already own it and consider it to be the band's best work.  It is on lists of greatest albums of all time.  People who appreciate music in general agree that this album belongs in the collection of any true music fan.  Those who haven't listened to a lot of Def Leppard often become fans after hearing Hysteria.  It may have taken Elliott and company three years to record this one, but the result makes you wish, If only everyone took the time necessary to make a work of art like Hysteria.
B005KWL2IW|5.0|So awesome it makes my pink parts tingle and tingle and tingle and tingle and tingle and tingle and tingle.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I want to make one thing clear: There are two items called Alien Anthology. One was released in 2010, and one in 2012. The 2012 release does NOT have all of the cool bonus stuff that you no doubt have read about or have seen pictures of. I HIGHLY suggest you ensure the copy you purchase, if you do decide to purchase AA, is the 2010 release with all 6 discs.<br /><br />I'd never seen any of these films before I bought this. Really.<br /><br />I have a friend who is a big movie fan, and every time I see him he'll bring up a film, and 5 minutes later go, \\"You've seen that, right?\\"<br />The answer is always \\"Nope.\\"<br /><br />When this happened with Pulp Fiction, the rest of my afternoon was pretty much determined for me. You can insert any significant film in that spot and odds are it'll work.<br /><br />With the Alien series, I wanted to do something about it before the question could come up. I knew at some point he'd get to Ridley Scott. Blade Runner had already come and gone, but I could still beat him to Alien. I went ahead, and bought the Alien Anthology on a whim. It wasn't expensive by any means, and it had stellar reviews.<br /><br />I'm really, really glad I bought this.<br /><br />Alien Anthology spares no expenses in being a quality product. It's design, both aesthetic and functional, are reminiscent of the very thing it's a tribute to. The book uses nice, thick, pages, with one page per film, and a dividing page between the films. The pages dedicated to a film have that films disc inside them, via an initially hard to see slip pouch. Just look closely and you'll find the two spots for your fingers to rest.<br /><br />The content on disc itself is overwhelming at first. The Anthology includes an instruction manual that I highly suggest reading thoroughly, it will help you get the most out of your experience with each disc. Things like MU-TH-UR mode make repeat viewings more than just \\"Oh, I didn't notice that before.\\" and as much as I loathe the expression,you really need to be there to get it. It's remarkable.<br /><br />If you looked at this product and had even the slightest tinge of interest, buy it. Don't hesitate, don't second guess it, buy it. You won't regret it. I am so glad I went through with this.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie was awesome. I came out of the theater with a big stupid grin on my face. Everything about this movie was fantastic. It almost seems like the story came straight out of the comics. The characters interactions felt very real and believeable. They felt like regular humans (sorry Thor) that are distrustful of each other. They were sizing each other up and even battled each other briefly. It was great. But when the chips were down, they came together to defeat the enemy.

0316067601|5.0|Every single American should be required to read this book.  From indoc, to BUD/S training, to combat, to survival, Marcus includes everything that he could that wasn't classified.  His story and the story of others in this book is truly inspiring and jaw-dropping.  You will want to read it again as soon as you are done with it the first time.  Just buy it and trust all the other reviewers on here, it is the real deal.  It is really that good.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|After hearing the buzz about Wool being a fantastic piece of self published work I decided to read at least Wool 1. I can easily say this is one of the best pieces of character driven sci fi I have ever read. The way the book is constructed keeps you hungering for more and before I knew it I was 400 pages deep into the book. Wool is exceptional writing.

B0004Z33EG|5.0|The ultimate edition dvd I just bought and promptly received has the Sly Stallone commentary thank you very much,one of the most underrated actors in movie history.Lefties love to wax cynical about him for political reasons.<br /><br />Any actor who becomes his character inside-out and outside-in,who puts in all effort required before and during production,that kind of extreme method actor is the genuine article and rare.Especially back when most actors were wimps or egomaniacs--wait until you here what Sly reveals about Kirk Douglas,WOW!<br /><br />No,Kirk Douglas didn't make it into the movie.THANK GOD!<br /><br />Sly's feature length commentary was excellent,very insightful and humorous.Great anecdotes..He did engage in some ego-tripping for a moment ridiculing a supporting actor who only did what he was told.But then Sly went back to being more humble and appreciative.<br /><br />I have to disagree also about this one brief scene that Sly apparently hated,which provide a stark contrast between what a Green Beret is vs the weekend warriors pursuing him.I didn't think this contrast was comical,I thought it was essential...Yes,as Sly put it,there was two different movies for a moment,by design.The director wanted to show what a farce this story could have been without a divinely inspired director who was definitely on Stallone's side all the way..This contrast made Stallone's character more real.<br /><br />Feature length audio commentary!Accept no substitutes!..Thru the commentary you get to watch a favorite movie from someone else's perspective,which is almost like watching the movie for the first time.And you learn stuff that you would have never known without the commentary...This is what really distinguishes dvd from vhs.Feature length commentary from cast and crew should be mandatory on all dvds with great movies on them.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Wow, just wow!<br /><br />Kill Decision is a very fast paced technothriller. Even more so than Daemon, it's grounded in near-term science. Everything that Suarez writes about either exists now or could exist within the next few years. Remote-controlled military Drones exist. Autonomous flying craft exist. It's only a matter of time before armed drones are autonomous, and Suarez neatly explains why.<br /><br />Although the action starts quickly, right around the half-way point, the pace suddenly accelerates to warp speed. I raced through the second half of the book. As you're reading, there will be a point where you'll suddenly sit up straight and say \\"Holy cow, this book is really good,\\" and then you won't be able to put it down again until the end.<br /><br />The depiction of man-vs-machine fights was utterly terrifying, as it should be. In fact, all of the combat scenes were very well done. I thought the two main characters, Lind and Odin are likable, compelling characters.<br /><br />Without wanting to include any spoilers, I will say that the plausibility of the bad guys seems a little weak. But I don't think this will detract from your enjoyment. You might notice it, but you'll probably just move on, enjoying the plot and conflict.<br /><br />Daemon was one of the best books I'd read in years, and so I was eagerly looking forward to Kill Decision. It exceeded my expectations.

I think the book entails her experiences but to say there is no judgement or need for forgiveness for murderers, rapists and suicide bombers, there is no need to forgive anyone.  I am unable to understand this.  Pass your all encompassing love to all victims of these crimes.  Please help us to help heal  victims of Aurora, CO.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|I am so happy that I discovered Amazon DVDs on demand!  It was so easy to download these DVDs and they are available anytime I want to watch them.  I did not have to go from store to store trying to find the entire season 2 of Walking Dead.  Season 2 of Walking Dead is really good.  If you liked season 1 you will like season 2. I highly recommend both the service of downloading the dvds from Amazon and the season 2 series of Walking Dead.  [...]

If you wish to read any of the tables, they are almost impossible to dicipher.  The table data is the most useful in Perry's.  Not in this issue as you cannot enlarge the view because of the blur in the tables.  I would have not bought this if I had tried it.<br />Sorry, my old Perry's will still travel with me.<br />Jim P

0345803485|5.0|I just finished the Trilogy. I loved every book. I was very skeptical about buying the first book because of some of the reviews I read. Glad I did not listen to them and took a chance. The books were exciting. I would stay up late at night to read. I would read on my lunch break. These books will have you hooked. I like to read but I also love to listen to audios, however I decided I wanted to read the trilogy . They were wonderful. I thought the books were well written. I have already recommended them to family and friends.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Thiis book could have been really brilliant.  For half of it , it is.  Then the plot has to evolve yet again and again to a pretty unrealistic end.<br />Still good but so much promise at the beginning was lost.
0061689246|4.0|If you saw the movie and didn't like it, it would be a mistake to overlook this book for that reason. I read this book by mistake in a way.  It's the first Gaiman book I've read, but a family member bought and discarded it and I was bored.<br /><br />To be honest, at first I was skeptical about it. The first chapter or so didn't impress me. But as I had nothing else to do , I just kept reading. After I got past that chapter, it was just so good. Gaiman's writing flows very nicely. All of the characters have their own interesting story-I especially liked the personality of Tristan Thorne.<br /><br />Overall, I guess, this book is worth your time and money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|got time to kill, use this app, many games to choose from, keep trying to top high score, need more points yo open new game ahhh lol
B005FSI1IK|5.0|I had read this before but forgotten how incredibly funny it was. I love the Mile Vorkosegan series and have read every one I can get my hands on. Since we read them mostly as library books we are now collecting them on Kindle to be easily re-read. My favorite scene in this book is Miles's dinner party where everything goes wrong. Enrique's misguided attempt to impress Miles with a butter bug bearing the Vorkosegan crest was so believable! We've all known nerdy, scholarly types like Enrique. As an insect lover from childhood I could relate to his love of bugs that must look like large cockroaches. I would love to see this book made into a movie, though it does come right in the middle of the Vorkosegan saga.<br /><br />Beside seeing Miles struggle to figure out how to romance Ekatarin, the book also has some very exciting parts where we fear Nicky will be kidnapped or Miles charged with murder. Amazingly, all the tangled threads are tied together in an outrageous but satisfying conclusion.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game for the kids. They love checking back in for fun items and they LOVE kung fu<br /> scrat! they would love other levels to that part of the game.
0439023513|4.0|The rebellion against President Snow and the Capitol is in full swing.  Katniss and a handful of her fellow victors have been snatched from the clutches of the Capitol after Katniss is able to eliminate the force-field surrounding the Quarter Quell...the 75th Hunger Games.  But the rebels are not able to rescue all of the victors, Peeta and several others fall into the hands of President Snow while Katniss is spirited away to District 13 where she learns its population has survived for decades underground.<br /><br />In District 13, Katniss is thrust into the machinations and maneuverings to overthrow President Snow.  The rebels need her.  They need her to be the Mockingjay...the torchbearer for the rebellion.  Katniss agrees...if somewhat reluctantly.<br /><br />So in the midst of being used by the rebels for propaganda purposes, Katniss is also worrying deeply about Peeta.  The rebels aren't the only ones capable of propaganda, and with Peeta in Snow's clutches the President takes full advantage of the situation.<br /><br />Will Peeta be rescued alive?  Will Katniss and the rebels overthrow Snow and the Capitol?  And, with District 12 left in ashes, even if the rebels are able to overthrow President Snow, what kind of life will Katniss be able to have afterward?<br /><br />And throughout all of this, Katniss, as she did in the previous book, continues her attempt to deal with the emotional scars the Games have left behind.  In some ways it is not enough to have merely survived the Games, it is also coping with the after-effects as well.<br /><br />Mockingjay was a bit lethargic to start off with, but once the plot starting moving the book was an easy page-turner.  The author does a good job of pointing out that just because a horrible event has been left behind (i.e. The Hunger Games/Quarter Quell) doesn't mean that those involved can just pick up their lives from where they left off...despite the action and violence in this book, the majority of the scars are notphysical, they are emotional.  How do you deal with a traumatic event...or even more than one?  Slowly...a day, an hour, a moment at a time...inexorably...  This is Katniss's path and all of the other victors' as well.  In the acknowledgments, the author credits her father for, \\"educating his children on war and peace\\".  I'd say he did a pretty good job.  Mockingjay is definitely worth picking up as a culmination to Katniss's story.
031620157X|5.0|I am 66 years old. I grew up with fairy tales, but admit I don't recall \\"lessons\\" from them, just the delightful stories. I bought this book for my grandkids ages 2 to 9. When I received the book, I read the first chapter, and realized there was something special in my hands. I could not put it down. I was as enthralled as reading Harry Potter for the first time. I am in awe of the young man who wrote this. How wonderful to have such a great imagination and be able to write so cleverly. I doubt the grandkids would get as much from it as I did, so I passed it to my 62 year old sister who understands the same ecitement that I felt. I feel sad for young children who don't know these wonderful tales anymore, except what is presented in the movie versions. I thank the author so much for a WONDERFUL read. I just can't say enough in his praise.
0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle is a true American hero. His sacrifice and service to his country is inspiring. This book is full of action and relates the reality of war in detail. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a book of real life combat action.

034580404X|3.0|My wife had a Birthday, ordered a cookbook from Amazon.com. She saw a book in the mail, which was whisked away to hiding till the special day arrived. Was very surprised at her disappointment when she opened her gift and it was not \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\". So here goes another purchase. She started the first book on vacation but has not finished it yet. The only bad thing is the pages have fell away from the binding on the first part, coming apart under normal use. Could tell you things I have heard of these writings, rumors, media reports of a baby boom caused by the reading of this book, or that the thing has broken record sales of even Harry Potter and others. This one is for adults only, please. Felt it was a great bargain at the price I paid, even if it needs reglued.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|great game! the improvements that they could make would be to make the items in the store cheaper and extra land cheaper also. should give more silver coins out in snowpiles more. other than that, great game.

B005LAIGJQ|2.0|Though I like Eddie Murphy, unsurprisingly,  A Thousand Words is not one of Eddie Murphy's classic roles  that left me laughing.  It has a laugh here and there, but for the most part the movie fails on comedy. Overall, the movie did have a a powerful message, but the sudden shift from  comedy to drama made me wonder if the movie would not have been better suited as a drama .
B004XWLN20|5.0|The other day I met Tom Welling and he signed some of my merch for me, which was awesome. But when he was done I said \\"I love you\\" and instead of getting creeped out, he said \\"I love you too\\" and then he looked into my eyes longingly before we embraced in a passionate kiss. I told him \\"Cheaper by the Dozen 2 is your best work\\" and then his face crumpled with anger and he slapped me so hard that I toppled over and knocked my head on the ground.
0062197258|5.0|I just finished reading \\"Into The Darkest Corner,\\" a book that for the first 250 pages stunned me, then I pretty much figured out a few things that were obvious--I will not point them out and give away the story for those of you contemplating reading it--It is worth it! But be forewarned that there are parts that depict unspeakable acts again another human being. With all the elements of good storytelling, I feel the author did a great job of describing the main character's OCD, building the climax of leaving you racing to the next page just to see what is going to happen and then there was the obvious red flags that I caught on to early on in the story, but nonetheless continued down the path to see just what was lurking in the darkest corner. I enjoyed reading this book from an up and coming new mystery/suspense writer from England and I will be looking out for other books by the author in the future.

B000IKAHN2|4.0|I love Atlantis, so I don't want to give it a bad review.  But I have a problem with amazon's editing. I have the whole series at home, but I am out of town and wanted to watch it.  I only watched about half way through the first episode before I stopped it because there were so many scenes cut out.  Why are they editing it so much?  It makes me wonder how much they have cut out of other things that I have watched on amazon that I am not as familiar with.

B006RUJST6|2.0|I bought this book for my Kindle because of the number of great reviews it has received. Never will I make that mistake again! The characters are reasonably well drawn, but that is where the positive ends. The story is entirely predictable and the grammar is APPALLING! My recommendation - do not waste your money on this drivel.
B003K16P3M|4.0|I really enjoyed this.  The main character, Kasta, is superb.  She kicks butt and really and truly grows though out the novel.  She is dynamic and lots of fun to watch. Po is also a great character with as much heart as fight, which was a nice change since it is unusual to pair such a strong female lead with such a compassionate male lead.  I also loved how the latter third of the novel shows Kasta training Bitterblue to be a fighter too.  This was a very interesting fantasy world that I was more than happy to spend some time in.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0089CLOZQ The Inadvertent Thief (The Thief)]]

B0089IGUP4|4.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />I'm new to the Gaslight Anthem.  At first listen their new album sounded to me like average rock music with clich&eacute; rock lyrics, sung by a passionate, standout rock front man.<br /><br />But between the first listen and the second listen I found myself thinking about what I'd heard, that little snippets were stuck in my mind (a \\"whoa oh\\" here, an \\"oh sha la la\\" there), and that for some reason I wanted to hear it all again...<br /><br />At second listen I found that even if (and \\"if\\" being the key word) my earlier criticisms were correct, maybe it didn't matter all that much.<br /><br />This is a catchy, driving, relatively unsophisticated, yet easily likeable rock and roll album.  These guys get compared to Springsteen a lot.  I'd say well, yes, I see that - but if they have to be compared to famous fellow Jersey boys then I feel they're a little more like a scrappier, punkier Bon Jovi than Springsteen.<br /><br />Notice the three different guitar approaches that open \\"45,\\" the ear tattooing guitar work on the last thirty seconds of \\"Mullholland Drive,\\" the throat shredding vocal accents on \\"Too Much Blood,\\" the mellow beauty of album closer \\"National Anthem\\" - all of these and many more memorable moments contribute to an overall impression that because they've clearly got heart, although these guys may not end up on the cover of Time, their music is certainly worth your time.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener
081297381X|5.0|Excellent read that needs careful thought. However Nassim Taleb's style in this book is not to everyone's liking. His approach is to jolt the reader so that he/she will be more analytical and really think about things. His `healthy ego' also ruffles feathers, but then again this is, I believe, intentional on his part so that readers pay attention.
B0083EM24C|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />Passion Pit's new album GOSSAMER bounces and pops with color and frenetic energy.  Fuzzed out electro bass beats and poppy, high register vocals weave with skittery, electro soundscapes on one fascinating track after another.  Fascinating, because for all the get-up-and-dance dynamic there's an underlying sadness to many of the lyrics - which creates kind of a tasty musical sweet and sour effect.  In other words, the album cover is right on target with its depiction of sunshine and clouds.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener
B008BRC6NS|5.0|\\"Dance Again: The Hits\\" by Jennifer Lopez\\"  is an anthology of her musical hits over the course of her career. \\"Waiting For Tonight\\", \\"Let's Get Loud\\", `Feelin So Good\\", and \\"On the Floor\\" are some of the festive tracks on her cd. The inclusion of \\"Secretly\\", \\"I'm Real\\" (original remix),\\"Baby I Love U!\\",\\"Papi\\", and \\"Ain't It Funny\\" (original mix) would have added extra fun to an already good collection. `Dance Again: The Hits\\" by Jennifer Lopez is great for those who like at least three songs by Jennifer Lopez.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|\\"Living Things\\" by Linkin Park contains music that creatively embodies emotional vulnerability and resilience.  It is completely different from any of their other albums, but this change really fits with the \\"Living Things\\" title of the cd. For example, \\"Castle Of Glass\\" brilliantly touches on how tragically it is human nature for many to judge others from the metaphor of \\"glass houses\\".  \\"Lost In The Echo\\",\\"Victimized\\", \\"Roads Untraveled\\", \\"Skin To Bone\\" and \\"Tinfoil\\" are some of the compelling songs that touch a chord on the transformation that challenges can bring. \\"Living Things\\" by Linkin Park is a good selection for those who like electronica and rock and/or at least two Linkin Park albums.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I am a massive reader of all types of books, biographies, crime fiction, memoirs, funny chic books, etc.<br /><br />This whole series was great. It was completely different to anything I had read before, but that made it all the more fun. I had no idea what I was going to be reading about as I purchased the e-book without reading the media hype but found I was hooked the whole way through.<br /><br />People have critised these books beyond belief - \\"it's terrible\\", \\"it's disgusting\\", \\"it's porn\\"! I prefer to make my own judgement based on what I like and don't like. These books are NOT for everyone. If you don't like to read modern day sex - don't read it.<br /><br />For a recently married 30yr old female I found it tapped into my heart, my head and my soul. My husband certainly enjoyed me reading it too!<br /><br />My advice to those considering it don't listen to anyone, if you want to read it do, if not don't. Make up your own mind, take what you want out of the book. I did & so did my friends - we loved it!<br /><br />Christian Grey is the bad boy we've all dated but wished deep down was good. Grey is both of those things & more.<br /><br />Great work EL James! Can't wait for the next series!
B007FZ7R7W|4.0|I must begin this review by prefacing that I do like Rihanna's music and count \\"We Found Love\\", \\"Talk That Talk\\", \\"Drunk On Love\\",and \\"Roc Me Out\\" among some of my favorite songs from her \\"Talk That Talk\\" cd. Additionally, I do not condone domestic violence regardless of who starts the fight first. With that said, I admit listening to \\"Fortune\\" with the belief that many people deserve second chances.  Too many everyday people and celebrities frequently give up in life after making mistakes and thinking that their lives are now over.  In fact, it is often the opposite and a mistake is only a stepping stone to greater opportunities and pulling oneself back up.<br /> Musical elements of dance, hip hop, and pop are crafted on this cd with party tracks such as \\"Bassline\\", \\"Party Hard\\", \\"Free Run\\" and \\"Turn Up the Music\\". \\"Fortune\\" by Chris Brown is best for those who have heard and liked Chris Brown's \\"Beautiful People\\" and/or hip hop and dance music hybrids. This is mainly because many of the songs on \\"Fortune\\" are fashioned from the related theme of \\"Beautiful People.\\"

B007WA56OQ|4.0|Back in 2002, I was stationed in Japan and heard \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" multiple times and recall also hearing her on the radio while visiting family in the states. My husband also introduced me to her by sharing \\"Body Language\\" and \\"Fever\\" cds with me during the week of our 2004 wedding. Needless to say, her music grew on me and I have positive memories of her music. Over the years, I purchased her \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" collection in 2005, \\"X\\" during the winter of 2007, and \\"Aphrodite\\" during July 2010.  Fortunately, I got the chance to see her at a 2011 concert and to me she makes the songs sound even better live. With that said, I rated it four stars only because this cd has some of the following hits that are on the cds that I just mentioned: \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Better the Devil You Know\\",\\"All the Lovers\\", \\"Red-blooded Woman\\" and \\"Confide In Me\\".  This makes it a collection that is best for those who are completely new to her music and those who only own her \\"X\\" or \\"Aphrodite\\" cds.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love this app. It has a satisfying amount of mediums and colors, and the ability to save drawings in an album. It also has a large amount of stickers and backgrounds. I do wish they would make it easier to color under the little handle or whatever you call the thing on the right side. Also, it would be helpful to adjust the size of your brush, pencil, or crayon, and to rotate the picture saved in  your album. I would also like to have a custom background by picking a color out of a rainbow and choosing how dark it will be. Those are just suggestions to make the app perfect. Otherwise, I love this app and I use it everytime I have nothing better to do. Well worth the two dollars.

0985114606|5.0|Like many of you, I read 50 Shades and was obsessed. It took me 1 week to read all 3 50 Shades books. I was sad when they were over!!<br />I stumbled on an article on Bared to You and was looking to fill my void. I waited a few months before reading and let me tell you, I finished this one in 2 days!<br /><br />This book is very similar to 50 but I'm guessing you know that. However, Ms. Day is a far better author so I wasn't annoyed by the constant use of 'mutter'!!!<br /><br />Overall, I think both books are great. I am truly looking forward to the 2nd book in October as its rather unfair to say which I like more right now. All I can recommend is if you did loved 50 shades, you will more than likely love this as well. I know I downloaded it at $5.99 which is a price that can't be beat!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is really fun. It's a cute, different take on the original Where's My Water? game. The only downside is that it was short. More levels please! :)

B003YOXINU|2.0|It took Peter Gabriel 6 years to follow up his commercial breakthrough album \\"So\\" with his next opus entitled \\"Us\\".  Gabriel is a perfectionist and I get the feeling that this one was meticulously gone over and re-done to the point of sucking much of the life out of the finished product.  The results were a rather sterile album that lacked much of what made some of his earlier albums great.  For me \\"Us\\" is where Gabriel fell off the tracks in a big way.  This is a lackluster album with rather pedestrian songwriting and music that is just plain dull for the most part.  It is hard to believe that the same person who wrote \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" also penned such dreck as \\"Kiss That Frog\\" and \\"Love To Be Loved\\" on this one.  The big hit single \\"Steam\\" sounds like the record company told him to make another \\"Sledgehammer\\", which in my opinion was one of the weaker tracks off of \\"So\\".  Ok, I am being a bit harsh here, and things are not all doom and gloom.  There are a few really good tracks on the album including \\"Come Talk To Me\\", \\"Blood Of Eden\\", \\"Digging In The Dirt\\" and the album closer \\"Secret World\\" (although I think the live version on \\"Secret World\\" live blows the studio version away).  In the end though, \\"Us\\" just does not stand up to what we know this man is capable of producing.  By Peter Gabriel's lofty standards this one may be the weakest in his catalogue.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|personally i don't really see a huge change between the free or paid version the only diffrence are ads which aren't actually that bad.. my choice is stick to the free one
B00000IMTH|5.0|\\"Long Live Rock And Roll\\" would be the last album to feature vocalist Ronnie James Dio at the helm.  The band would go on to more commercial success, but the quality of music certainly suffered after this one.  The \\"Rising\\" album is still the band's great statement, but \\"LLRR\\" is not far behind it.  Dio and Blackmore are at the absolute top of their game here and there really is not a weak track to be found.  The album was also engineered by Martin Birch so the sound, even by today's standards is top notch. There is not much more to say about this one.  If you are a fan of Blackmore or Dio this album is a must own.  Long Live Rock N Roll indeed!

B007P6VLRS|5.0|I sampled this album on MOG a couple weeks ago, and I didn't catch it's brilliance until my second or third listen. This is easily Corgan's best work since Siamese Dream (maybe better). Oceania proves again Corgan is a master songsmith. I can't remember the last time a song made me smile every time I played it, but \\"Pinwheels\\" is a masterpiece of pop music. The synthesized opening melody, the celebrating song lyrics, the unexpected backing vocals, they all make for a truly great song. Corgan has several other outstanding pieces, including \\"Pale Horse\\", a dark brooding lament about mental illness, the hopeful and true-blue ode to love, \\"One Diamond One Heart\\", and the atmospheric \\"Violet Rays\\". As a bonus there are a few tracks that have the guitar-riffed fun of the Pumpkins early works, like \\"The Chimera\\", \\"Inkless\\" and \\"Quasar\\". In the middle of all this is the eerie \\"Oceania\\", with it's dirge-like guitar chords (think U2) and irrepressible drum progressions, which, despite my initial reservations, totally redeems itself (yes, a Dumb and Dumber reference) in its overblown grandiosity.<br />  I have enjoyed Smashing Pumpkins since hearing \\"Drown\\" in 1992 (one of my all time favorite rock songs) and seeing them live at the Gulfport Civic Center in 1993. If age and experience makes for a better artist, than \\"Oceania\\" proves the maxim.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game more than any game I have. it is fun and challenging. even if you replay a level it still tricks you I play it all the time!!!!!

At least the MB works extremely well and I'm not left without a computer!

B006LSZECO|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it really hooked me and reeled me in completely--and not many books can do that.  After reading the good reviews, I bought it on impulse late one night and started it with high hopes.  Each chapter is told by either the husband Nick or his wife Amy.  To say that their marriage is in deep trouble is to state the obvious from the synopsis; their marriage is a competition to see which one can \\"win\\" and how happy they can be--every minute of every day. Therefore, at the beginning, their marriage is happy as long as each of them sustains the \\"honeymoon,\\"---doing all of the things that please the other.  It begins to deteriorate when each of them cannot sustain the \\"happy\\" act and adjust to the reality of marriage. In Nick's chapters, I root for Nick and in Amy's chapters, I root for Amy. I find that I am completely drawn in to each character--superb character development--I'm actually experiencing what each character is experiencing.<br />  UNTIL--UNTIL--UNTIL--Amy suddenly throws down all pretenses and reveals herself to be a character quite different from what I have assumed.  She is evil incarnate--a psycho--and her husband has to figure out how to beat her at her own game.  At that point, all of my sympathies change over to Nick, and I actually start to feel a little sorry for Amy as she is lured into his trap.  THEN--Amy pulls a shocker of her own and \\"one-ups\\" her husband.  By this point,I've found that I can't put the book down,(I am still immersed in each character).  Now I can't wait to see justice served-- so I wait--and wait--and wait--and wait---! I was surprised, shocked, and DISAPPOINTED at the ending (very disappointed in Nick's decision, but what other decision could he make?)  I thought to myself--I've stayed up, read every free minute, and lost sleep--for this ending??!  In retrospect, Gillian Flynn probably planned this reaction all along--it certainly reiterates the question:  HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR SPOUSE--OR ANYONE????<br />I recommend this book if you want to get involved emotionally and feel completely drained at the end!!!<br />---OK, a footnote about the language in the book. Although I am not a prude, I was offended by the amount of slutty language and choice of expletives. Yes, I made the choice to continue reading it, and yes, I gave it a great review, but I want others to be forewarned. This in no way, however, negates my positive review of a well-written thriller.
1419703692|5.0|What an awesome book. This really lets you get into the mind of one of the great directors in Hollywood today. This is a must purchase for any film or Batman fan. It also includes a great forward that is essentially Christopher Nolan's farewell to Batman. [...]
1439127700|5.0|This book is a must-have for any serious or amateur historian who wants more info on the presidency and the behind-the scenes activity going on at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Just the assist from former president Herbert Hoover to Harry Truman is worth the price of the book in itself. Even if you have but a casual interest in the Presidency the details herein are surprising, astonishing and will give you pause to consider the magnitude of assistance the former presidents stand ready to render to the incumbent when asked. If you want to add to your knowledge base of presidential lore, or merely spice up your knowledge just a bit, the pages in this book will take on a journey you cannot even begin to anticipate until you start reading. A terrific addition to your library and a valuable reference work, too.
0812550706|5.0|I'll keep it short and simple. If you're good with spacial reasoning, this book will conjure up crazy visualizations of the environment and action that Card so perfectly describes. If at first you don't quite understand what Card is trying to describe, don't worry, it will come after you read more.<br /><br />MINOR SPOILER BELOW:<br /><br />The first game that Ender plays (on his computer) is a beautiful fantasy world that Card walks the reader through so carefully. Enjoy it! Try to add all the details you can to the picture you create in your mind while reading. It's like a lucid dream, printed and published!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|If you've been too timid to buy erotic literature before, you may feel more comfortable buying this one because it is so popular.  My recommendation is don't. The characters are weak, the storyline is poor, and the writing is immature and repetitive. If you're after a decent erotic novel, with hotter sex scenes (come on, let's not pretend you're considering fifty shades for it's brilliant storyline) pick something else from Amazons erotic literature section. I recommend someone like Selena Kitt.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is an ok game kind of addicting but if you like adicting games you should get the angry birds series
B007UW9VWO|5.0|Having seen this in a theater with the film's creator David Gelb, I was anxiously waiting for the chance to own this and watch it at home.<br /><br />On its surface, it is a taunting collection of imagery for food lovers and the story of a sushi master. Once you start watching the film,  you soon realize the true story lays in the relationship of this family of sushi masters. This is a great insight into Japanese culture, familial expectations, sibling rivalries and living in the shadow of a master.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning as it was shot with the RED one camera. The footage is so clear you can see the thinly applied sauces spread out and absorb into the food.<br /><br />The interviews and look into the private life of Jiro Ono is fascinating. There are not many people who have done the same job for 75 years and want to continue doing it. A look into the fish market of modern day compared to what Jiro Ono experienced as a young man is very interesting.<br /><br />I've yet to watch it with Gelb's commentary track but he made some great points at the screening so I have high hopes for this feature.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who loves sushi, food, japanese culture, served with a side of sociology.

B004HW7JI8|5.0|Loved the first series and watched the second series and decided that I wanted them as part of my collection of movies and t.v. series. Our local library had part one so I've been able to watch it at my leasure and really enjoyed the first season so when season 2 came out I had told my family that I wanted it for Christmas but they surprised me and ordered both seasons for me just because they could. Great quality and great service as it arrived within 6 days of them ordering and was perfect. This show gets better and better and although the books are very different from the televison show, it's so much fun to watch and to lose yourself an episode at a time. I had planned on waiting for the price to come down but when I looked at our stores prices, Amazon and it's sellers were $20.00 cheaper than the cheapest store price so it was a good deal all around. Having a large selection of things to watch at our home when it's convient for us is a big plus and having Pretty Little Liars seasons 1 and 2 is quite enjoyable for me, especially the price. Being able to pause and rewind and catch something I may have missed when watching it the first or second time is wonderful and this series has certainly kept me guessing as to who will \\"A\\" really turn out to be. Love the books but love the television show more. Good job guys.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|This group is so amazing that it's almost impossible to believe they've only been performing together for such a short time. Each member is critical to the fabulous melodies, harmonies, and rhythms found in each piece of music, and their original music is wonderful. I cannot recommend this EP highly enough and look forward to the next addition to their body of work.
B0089AF2DS|3.0|This is nothing new or fantastic. The vocal track is ok, the instruments are ok, the experiments are ok, the hooks are ok. As a rock album it's ok. What this isn't is some &#34;impossibly ambitious prog-rock opus that has delivered like never before.&#34;  I can accept that bands change, I more than welcome it. I am not in any way shape or form claiming that this band has sold out in any way. If there is any one factor where this band has improved it's that it has tried something new. I respect that more than anything.  However, and this is the part where none of the words prior to these matters: the result, despite the fact that they shuffled off their &#34;metal&#34; coil and became something different, is that it amounts to a decent rock album that tries (but ultimately fails) at being something more. The result is something lesser than the sum of its parts. It's entirely good, but once the final track wraps, what's left in memory is a lot of muddled sounds all blending together, with little in the way of stand out material.  Yellow and Green is no better or worse than the other acts you might find and compare it to, but when I attribute that to Baroness I ultimately see that as a loss. It will play in the car for a week or two, but I don't expect much more than that. Yellow and Green can be queued with a bunch of like-sounding bands for some pleasant background noise, which is what will finally happen to Yellow and Green, and in the end is more of a let down to me than anything else.d when I attribute that to Baroness I ultimately see that as a loss. It will play in the car for a week or two, but I don't expect much more than that. If you love the new sound that's awesome. I just don't see it working for them. They were better when they were louder. They had a more unique sound when they didn't care. Here is something I see razor focused on fitting into a specific genre, on ducking down their head and shoulder height taller to fit into the rest of the crowd. There is nothing wrong with that, but has never been a reason why I have listened to Baroness. Yellow and Green can be queued with a bunch of like-sounding bands for some pleasant background noise, which is what will finally happen to Yellow and Green, and in the end is more of a let down to me than anything else.<br /><br />****UPDATE****<br /><br />Nope. This one really doesn't work for me at all, I'm afraid. I am not going to change my original score, but after a bunch of tries I just can't get behind this album at all.<br /><br />Listen to the track, \\"Little Things\\" which more or less sums up this album for me in its entirety. A plodding, non-varied and slow-moving struggle for three minutes until they get bored with their own track and decide to try and vary it at exactly the 4:00 mark. Two tracks later, \\"Cocainium\\" takes nearly a half minute more into its procession to have the courtesy of doing the same. \\"Back Where I Belong\\" just plays through and then fades out in an entirely unremarkable fashion, almost daring you to come to terms with the fact that it's 6:15 long and not 44:59. \\"Sea Lungs\\" plays and serves as a reward for having to listen to the previous 2.8 songs.<br /><br />Disc 2 pretty much abandons any pretense of variation. After the single most interesting track in the whole project, \\"Board up the House,\\" is finished it's a complete mash of \\"MTNS.\\",  \\"Foolsong,\\" and \\"Collapse.\\" By the time \\"Psalms Alive\\" finally gets going I'm only sticking around because I've been tryingso hard to like the album.<br /><br />I just can't wrap my head around the process which lead them here. They were so good prior to this mess... oh well.
0307592731|1.0|This woman needs mental help.  If you want to read about a woman with no capacity for good decision-making and no emotional maturity, this is the book for you.

1416562605|5.0|The White Tiger is a very powerful and beautifully written book.  I had to read it twice, or I should say, I wanted to read it twice to be sure I didn't miss anything.  The main character's evolution is deftly depicted, and he emerges from a poor Indian houseboy into a first class wheeler-dealer in a very believable and fascinating way. I recommemded this book to my entire high school class.  Im 67 years old!
0307010856|5.0|My kids loved this book when they were little.  I was very sad when I unpacked a box of books recently and it was not in the box.  When I found the book on Amazon I couldn't wait for it to arrive.  It came faster then I expected and in mint condition.  The seller was wonderful to work with and I will order more from them in the future.
B005CKPQHA|5.0|Great quality of video. Really enjoyed watching and can recall any time I want to go back and see it again.<br />The only downside is when I would switch to full screen, the screen would go blank although I could hear the sound. Took me a little digging to find the setting to make it a viable option, so maybe to include that note for first-time users would be of benefit.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game.  Great for all ages.  Mindless fun that my four year old granddaughter can play too.  I wish there were better instructions for newbies though.
B007UXTG8M|3.0|Is there something wrong with me if I do not feel that the character Brandon has a sex addiction? I see his sexual decisions as typical male behavior; his life isn't destroyed--he still has a job, money, home. Seems pretty stable to me. So what if he can't connect with some/most women/men on a more 'socially-desired/accepted/expected' relationship level? It may not be his time and/or not the right person. The pressure to be like everyone else is more detrimental IMO. Perhaps this movie would have been better off with more focus on Brandon's relationship with his unstable sister, which seems to hint at something abnormal/forbidden in the past.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender is a great actor, no argument there, but why cast Mulligan? I think she's a terrible actress, too one dimensional and her struggle to act is too noticeable.  McQueen's directing style is not quite to my liking (with his pattern of long, drawn-out scenes that overstay their visit, sudden time jumps, AWOL characters, etc), but I've seen worse. I was disappointed with this movie though, given how much hype its been getting. This movie would have been 1-2 stars if it weren't for Fassbender.

B008BRC6NS|5.0|I have to be honest,there are some hits not on here..maybe part 2 soon with videos also not on here.Jlo has many music hits and contines to be a club favorite,so you can't expect all hits on one CD..but this is an Amazing collection of JLO hits and great videos,love it..it is a must own in your music collection.So those of you complaining not  all songs are on there,remember its one CD and it is limited on space.Jlo has many hits,so they will probably have hits 2,because there is alot of great Jlo videos and songs not on here,but it still is a must own.So be fair and give it three or more stars,not one because it did not have your song or mix on there.Also,remember it is.called hitd,not Greatest hits ;)
B008F5YDRI|5.0|It's such a pleasure to watch a calm, thoughtful story that tells its story with simplicity and sweetness. Others have described the basic plot and characters so I won't go into those again, but rest assured that for a refreshing tale, wonderful actors, pleasant dialogue and more than a few laugh out loud moments, you could do very much worse.

0671027344|5.0|I didn't expect to get (magically) swept away. I really didn't. I was expecting a whining, dramatic fifteen-year-old Charlie. But all i encountered was openness and sweet, sweet honesty. Oh, Charlie. You owned me from page one. :)<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a lot of things. It dealt with drugs, sex, abuse, bullying. You might find that negatively intimidating but Chbosky's writing softened the blows that might have stung because of such delicate issues. The softening was a welcome embrace.<br /><br />Charlie had a run with (almost) everything teenager-y. Unrequited first love. LSD. Make out sessions. Smoking. Abortion. With all this, he still felt he was standing on the sidelines. But he was loved by his sister. he talked to his dead aunt in the graveyard when no one else wants to be his friend. he has his English teacher who kept on giving him books that seemed to be the little stories of his life.<br /><br />A tumultuous year it might've been, but Charlie made it. By being unconsciously strong, and unflinchingly accepting to things he cannot alter.<br /><br />Once I started, I could not put down The Perks of Being a Wallflower. It's charisma is undeniable. Numerous chuckles erupted from me every now and then. I want to shelter Charlie from the harsh realities of life, but Charlie reveled in it. He flourished. And while things in the past cannot change, Charlie chose to move on with his life. But this time, he will be living it, and not for others. =)<br /><br />I am in love with the mixed tapes! Asleep by the Smiths. Landslide by Fleetwood Mac. A song from Nirvana. Me and Charlie have similar taste in music!<br /><br />And Charlie likes to read! *high five* Mostly they are classics, and yes, i will read them soon. i already added them to my TBR list! such is the power of Charlie over me. Gosh, classics. Help me. Haha!
0525425578|1.0|Buying this book was a huge mistake; i just saw john grisham on the cover and picked it up. Theodore boone a bestseller?! Reading this piece of crap was two hours of my life ill never get back. The plot is pathetic, the grammar is awkward and this overall looks like the work of a ghostwriter who used grishams name to pilfer money. Its meant for kids but it doesnt mean u have to patronize by explainibg every minor detail, and then not explaining whose was the damn body the police found in the river;what did the parrot case have anything to do with anything? And where is the suspense, this book has numerous nonsensical passages; the last sentence of the book has nothing to do with the preceding paragraph and makes zero sense. I could have ate a box of alphabits and crapped a better book than this.

0783225792|5.0|I LOVE this movie. Robert DeNiro is BRILLIANT as always and Sharon Stone was so good in her role as a drug and alcohol addicted slut, that I enjoyed hating her. I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't already seen it. I would also recommend this seller annamack2008, the movie was in the condition the seller advertised and I got it in 2 days(the quickest I've ever gotten anything thru amazon.com).Thanks again.

B0053O89IS|4.0|I have not watched Bones since the first day, but have caught up by buying all the seasons to date. I love the show even if both Bones and Booth are a little full of themselves at times and act like ten year olds. The supporting cast makes up for their shortcomings.Mostly the stories are good and I wonder sometimes if everything they do can actually be done, but that's okay. Season 7 was short and I became frustrated by how it was on then it wasn't on. I had to be so vigilant watching for it. I have liked everything except Finn. If I wanted something like him, I'd watch Swamp People on the \\"History Channel\\". I don't appreciate bad grammar. I'm assuming this person went to school, didn't they teach him how to speak properly? Now for my question. Since Pelant has been on the scene, it's been tough going for Bones and Booth, but I wondered if anyone else, including Booth, noticed that the colonel that talked him to going back into service in season five, had the same last name, Pelant. It's not like Smith or Jones, it's an unusual name. Could they be related?

0345803485|1.0|[...]<br /><br />Perhaps the worst bestseller of all time.<br /><br />One dimensional characters...with no ability to emote any feeling. Long index finger aside...a character in a book should be fleshed out (ahem)in a way that you care about them...and feel what they are feeling.  They Emote.  They do not have to tell you what they are feeling, in a flat meaningless way.<br /><br />Repetitive use of language, phrases....if an editor had actually shown up...three books would have been edited down to one. Oh my, jeez, biting my lip, blah blah blah.<br /><br />And the sex?  Um...er-not-ica.  To steal a line from Kurt Vonnegut...this book caused my testicles to retract into my abdominal cavity, pulled them into the fuselage like landing gear of an airplane...and it may take surgery to bring them back down again.<br /><br />Just plain Awful...
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really good. I like it a lot .but I don't like how you have to earn so much money to buy a new charter
0345803485|2.0|I first read this story back in its fan fiction days, and I wasn't impressed then, and I'm certainly not impressed now.  For a fan fiction it was all right, but as far as being a bestseller?  Are you kidding me?  It's nothing but porn between an overbearing ass and whiney little girl.  Save your money.  If your desperate to read it, borrow from your library but don't waste your money on it.

014241543X|5.0|This is one of those books that from the start has you on the edge of your seat... Or bed like me aha anyways, how i came across the book? Well i was at my public library and i saw the book on sale. Not going to say how much but yeah i bought the book and when i got home i started to read the book. Usually i read the last page of a book and if it's good then ill read the whole thing if it's not then i don't even give it a second look. Like i was saying when i was reading the book it caught my attention by the way the author write's in the point of views and i got sucked into it and finished the book in  about 6 hours i took my time going back and reading because some words i didn't understand so yeah.<br />But when iw as done i was like 'Woah!I can't imagen going through all that and then waking up and just like i don't know' so yeah i really liked this book and i would highly recommend for someone who is looking for a book that has some mystery behind it and that has suspense and some romance and even if you aren't into those i still say you should try to give it a chance because who knows maybe you will like it.<br />SO yeah like i said i highly recommend and hope you enjoy it as much as i did and well there's a second book to it incase you like this one so yeah enjoy!
034580404X|3.0|The writing is easy to follow and flows well. The content is interesting during the first book and one half. The story line is too much in the background for my taste. The books are mostly about the touching, kissing, and sexual activities of the couple. Because it is a constant no matter where or when, it becomes too unbelievable. Even a 27 year old male is not that sexual, nor is it life-like for the girl who was a virgin to be so accomadating and expert. It hardly seems possible she would react the way Anastasia does every time.<br /><br />I am aware the product has been the top three sellers on the NY Time's best sellers list. I know there are many people who find this constant sex interesting, I am just easily bored I guess. I would recommend the books with mild caution.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this book.<br />I could not put it down!<br />I was about 60% finished and could not understand what else could come into the story but boy did it not disappoint!!!<br />Couldn't recommend this book enough!

B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Just from listening to the album I could immediately tell that there would be mixed reviews. The fact of the matter is that in Linkin Park's transitions through different sounds they've managed to pick up fans and enthusiasts from varying musical preferences. While this journey has been unsettling for many of us at times, I can't say that it hasn't been successful for them. Music is an art and they've proven themselves to be very successful artists despite what any of us individually feel about each chapter of their development. That said, I've been one of those original fans in the nu metal camp that has greatly missed the good ol' days of wistful screaming and epic power chords. At least that's what I thought. I had admittedly latched onto the old sounds and themes of Linkin Park with stagnant nostalgia as well, forgetting all the while that I too have grown up quite a bit sense then.<br /><br />So now that you understand where I'm coming from I will say that I'm quite impressed with Living Things. It's not for everyone. It's not for the Linkin Park fan that I used to be back in my emotionally turbulent high school days. It's for the Linkin Park fan that I am now. I see no sense in individually reviewing each musical offering on this album. You can hear clips of the tracks for yourself and many other reviewers have already covered just about every perspective available. If you haven't already decided to buy or not buy the album, you were probably never really interested in Linkin Park anyway.<br /><br />I simply want to ask those of you that do not personally appreciate this next step in LP's evolution to at least be fair. You don't have to like it, but if you call yourself a Linkin Park fan at all, at the very least respect it. From my understanding of Linkin Park's roots and the contributions of each member of the band throughout their history this is clearly an earnest musical exploration and expression of their creative minds. I hear so much of each individualin this music reminding me that, though their size of 6 has been scoffed at by some, each member in this band continues to play a significant role in making Linkin Park what it is. These men are now seasoned musicians, husbands, fathers, older and wiser. This isn't music for the masses. Linkin Park has already made their success and their money. They made this album for themselves. Keep this in mind as you listen to the melodies, rhythms and lyrics and perhaps different concepts and emotions will unfold for you.

B008BRC6NS|5.0|Jennifer Lopez embodies the full package of a true entertainer. Over the course of her music career, she has scored numerous hits worldwide that are featured in this classical collection. There are a couple of great hit songs missing such as Play, I'm Gonna Be Alright, and Ain't It Funny (Original Version). However, this only goes to show that she has too many gems and just not enough space to list her entire catalog of hits on one album.<br /><br />From her first hit song \\"If You Had My Love\\" to her current hit \\"Dance Again\\", this album is a great collection for longtime fans and also for the new generation as this album will take listeners on a ride to experience the amazing musical side of the JLO story.

B006GGR5QY|5.0|It has literally only been a week since I discovered the beauty of Olafur Arnarld's music, courtesy of the TV show, \\"So You Think You Can Dance.\\" They featured one of his pieces (3326) from \\"Eulogy for Evolution\\" in a dance number and I had to pause the show, I was so overwhelmed by the musical piece. After the show was over, I downloaded that album faster than you can say \\"MP3 player!\\" LOL Who says TV is a \\"vast wasteland\\"? Over 30% of my new music choices are from what I hear on TV shows!<br /><br />Since then, I've downloaded all of his other albums but have them split up into different folders. His two classical ones: \\"Living Room Songs\\" & \\"Eulogy for Evolution\\" are in a folder marked \\"Happy Place\\" and his more rock-oriented albums are just marked with his name. THIS album, along with \\"E.f.E.\\" are effortless to listen to: you can either zone them out or listen to them intensely, but either way you enjoy them, they bring me into a happy place. I have an intensely high stress job, owning a landscape firm, and ANY way that I can decompress, I'll take it. I found that listening to these two classical albums while doing billing/quotes or traveling to a job site place me in a very healthy and happy mood.<br /><br />I haven't listened to the other artists recommended by other reviewers but I place Olafur next to Brian Crain for enjoyable classical listening music. Now, I need to check out the other recommendations.<br /><br />Bravo to this 25 year old genius!!!!

1401937519|5.0|After reading Anita's story in Wayne Dyer's latest book, Wishes Fulfilled, I just knew that I had to read her book Dying to Be Me. So, when my friends at Hay House Publishing offered me a free copy in exchange for my honest review, I was delighted and waited in high anticipation for the book to come in the mail. Thankfully, it was not a disappointment in any way. I highly recommend that everybody reads this powerful book.<br /><br />This book is the true story of Anita Moorjani's near death experience after battling cancer for many years, and the significance that it had on her life. Anita was born in Hong Kong, and grew up in the midst of a few different cultures. Her family was from India, and they practiced Hinduism. The school that her family sent her to was Catholic. And she also had friends that followed Chinese traditions. All these different cultures thrust their expectations on Anita, and it caused her to grow up with a lot of internal conflicts and lose sight of who she really was inside.<br /><br />Later as an adult, Anita managed to connect with her soul mate and got happily married. But shortly after the wedding, disaster started to creep into her life. After watching her brother-in-law and best friend fight for their lives against the beast known as Cancer, Anita too was diagnosed. She refused chemo and her symptoms just got worse. When she was finally rushed into the hospital, she was weighing less than 80 pounds and had tumors the size of lemons all over her upper body. All of her organs completely shut down and she slipped into a coma. Her family was told to get the affairs in order because there was no way she was going to make it. This is when she had her experience on the other-side.<br /><br />When she crossed over Anita felt nothing but pure unconditional love. She had total awareness and understanding. She meet with her recently deceased father and her best friend that had just lost her battle with Cancer. At first I was thinking that maybe she just dreamed all of this, but Anita was also able to tell the doctors and her family about the things they were talking about when she was in the coma. The one conversation that she recalled for them took place down the hall from her room. She even saw her brother flying on a plane to Hong Kong to see her.<br /><br />While on the other side she was then given a choice, stay or return, and felt that it was best if she came back to her physical body. She knew that when she returned that she would be fully healed. Her only requirement was to \\"be herself\\" and \\"live fearlessly.\\" After fully recovering from her cancer, she began to share her story with others. Her message that we are all a part of this unconditional love, that we are all divine, eventually found it's way into Wayne Dyer's hands who encouraged her to write this book, Dying to Be Me.<br /><br />I am not telling the story very well, and I have skipped over a lot of the details, but that is okay because Anita does such an amazing job telling it herself. You just have to read this book for yourself. Her ability to paint a picture of the indescribable is quite spectacular. I found this book to be very gripping and have been recommending it to every one that I know. Once I started reading it, I just simply couldn't put it down and I ended up finishing it in just one day.<br /><br />The only real down side to this book was that it tended to get a little repetitive, especially in Part III. Anita follows the story telling pattern of a news anchor; Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you just told them. Don't get me wrong Part III is filled with some beautiful statements and fascinating insights, however they are buried among the same phrases that were written many times earlier in the book. With that said, some people may actually enjoy the repetition as it can help make the meaning of the story really sink in fully.<br /><br />It seems as though we live in a society that isscared to even talk about death. But once you get your hands on this book and read it for yourself, you will see the experience of death in a whole new light. I do. Anita was able to describe her experiences very well, but a part of me still wishes that I could have actually felt what she felt. Her vivid description of the unconditional pure love that she experienced while on the other side is astounding.<br /><br />Here is my favorite quote from the book, \\"In truth, I'm not my body, my race, religion, or other beliefs, and neither is anyone else. The real self is infinite and much more powerful - a complete and whole entity that isn't broken or damaged in any way. The infinite me already contains all the resources I need to navigate through life, because I'm one with Universal energy. In fact I am Universal energy.\\" I love this quote so much that I decided to start using it as an affirmation.<br /><br />When it comes right down to it, this is not a book about dying or the after-life. It is really a book about living. A book that invites us to re-evaluate our own life and to live it to the fullest, without fear. After reading this book I was left with a feeling of great inner peace. I really cannot recommend Dying to Be Me enough. I give it a five star rating. Now, it's time for me to keep my fingers crossed with the hope that Hay House Films will decide to turn this amazing story into a movie.scared to even talk about death.

B007L3BMGA|2.0|Maybe it was the hype - but I think not.  Reflecting on this book, it is poorly written.  The writer's repetitive phrasing and words gets tedious and spoils the reading.  I am not a literary, or grammar expert but I was very disappointed in this book.  Its a shame, as I wont be buying parts 2 or 3.

B0086700CM|5.0|its a fun game when I'm not playing xbox. and those of you that think this game ducks try playing the rip off/copyright brave version of the game.
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|I had high hopes for this film. So many Snow White inspired movies and shows out there recently, this one seemed really dark & cool. I was concerned that Kristen Stewart couldn't carry this role, and I was right. While she is beautiful, her acting is simply terrible. Charlize Theron as Evil Queen was so over the top, she was bordering a cartoon. Every sentence was enunciated and dragged, it bored me to death. Romantic subplot was a pure disaster. The Huntsman was supposed to be one side of a triangle, but ended up coming across like her father rather than lover. It was very very creepy. The prince was boring and lame. I can't even remember the actors face.<br />This film had more plot holes than a mesh sweater. I could even look pass all that if the movie was actually interesting. My boyfriend was snoring and I was half asleep somewhere in the middle. Buy and watch the DVD at your own risk, or if you have insomnia.<br />I gave it two stars because visual effects were beautiful and Charlize Theron's costumes were incredible.
B0015LBYMQ|5.0|Awesome album...even better on vinyl. Just like most of the newer vinyl I'm buying the depth of sound in this LP is superb. My only gripe is that the cover art (all white with subdued white lettering) is not the grey color pictured above. Personalty I think the white is boring. However, the LP is recorded over two separate pressings and each has a sleeve with a black/white pic of Johnny boy. I collect jazz and blues vinyl and this record proudly sits among the great albeit non-pop artists. Good music is good music. Must buy for vinyl!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is an awesome trilogy and I recommend it to anyone who would like to spice up their life a bit.  Once you start reading these, you won't be able to put them down.  The only bad part is when they are done.  You will suffer from Christian withdrawals.<br />I have had to go back and reread them to see what I missed the first time around.<br /><br />These books are a MUST HAVE!!!!!

030758836X|5.0|Ok, I got this book based on B&N reviews, and I will say from the start I was engrossed in it. It has alot of twists and turns, and just when you think you have it all figured out, another bombshell is dropped! I liked the fact that each character was a good guy and a bad guy, and not what you would expect. I would say a must read for anyone interested in crime or thrillers!

B003PIUBZS|5.0|I finally got around to watching Spartacus:  Blood and Sand. I was going to start watching it last Fall when I learned of Andy Whitfield's unfortunate passing.  I decided to postpone my review in favor of respecting his passing in case I found that I did not like the series. Sadly, I would learn that we did indeed lose a quite remarkable actor and that my fears of sullying his name were completely unfounded.<br /><br />This paragraph contains minor spoilers as it summarizes the first episode only.  The man who would later be dubbed Spartacus at the very end of the first episode is a Thracian who has agreed to serve the Romans as an auxiliary (although really the advance guard) to the Roman Legion in order to quell a Barbarian threat to the north.  Then, the Romans decide to turn East in order to serve the ego of the Roman leader Glaber (sp?) rather than face the barbarian horde that threatens Spartacus' home.  Outraged, Spartacus refuses to follow their lead, but his followers are a little \\"overzealous\\" in their refusal, attacking the Romans.  Spartacus flees from the scene to be reunitied with his wife.  Unfortunately, he is captured and his wife's fate is unknown although he is told that she will be enslaved.  Thereafter, Spartacus is thrown into the arena to face certain death only to emerge victorious...and thus begins his tale.<br /><br />Andy Whitfield, while easy on the eye which might otherwise drip acting poison, is an extremely good actor being able to convey a mix of emotions quite well through facial expression alone and his tone conveys a depth of sincerity.  Every emotion that he experiences, I immediately empathize with; I truly believe that we lost a man who could have easily been an Oscar-contender.  Craig Parker plays Glaber and if his face looks familiar, it's because he actually plays an elf in Lord Of The Rings (Fellowship and then Two Towers where he leads the ill-fated contingent of elves sent to help at Helms Deep).  When I heard Lucy Lawlesswas in this series, I was worried that the whole series may come across as a campy farce, but she actually does quite well as the wife of the man who would eventually purchase Spartacus as a gladiator, Baitatus.  Baritatus is played by John Hannah and I'm still having a hard time erasing his role in The Mummy movies from my memory.  He does quite well, however.<br /><br />Spartacus:  Blood and Sand is visually striking, but the CGI is a little heavy-handed at times.  It comes across as a poor man's \\"300\\" and sometimes it works and other times there is too much blood being sprayed for someone to have feasibly suffered just to pick himself up and keep fighting.  Backgrounds suffer the same, see-sawing from looking decent to looking too obviously CGI to be simply stylish.  That said, it doesn't detract from the overall experience - it's just occasionally distracting, that's all.<br /><br />One word of note - it earns a Mature rating for a good reason.  The first episode alone has plenty of violence and sexuality throughout.  Buyer be warned - this is definitely NOT a light treatment of the subject material and Starz holds very little back.<br /><br />I definitely think that Spartacus is worth investing time to watch.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I love this movie. I can't think of another naval war movie -- or any war movie for that matter -- that is even in the same ballpark, really. Everything from the acting to the visuals to the plot is excellent, and I've seen it many times. So when I found out about this special edition, I had to have it.<br /><br />The original DVD I bought was just the movie. No special features except for the subtitles, actually. This one has a whole 'nother disc devoted only to the special features, and there's a lot to behold. Took me three days to watch it all. Great material for fans of the movie.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Clockwork Angels is not an album you listen to lightly.  You can, of course, but the level of musicianship and creative genius on this album demands some dedicated listening.  Most great concept albums only get better with each playing, and Clockwork Angels is no different.  Each time through flushes out new parts that delight.  I heard Geddy say in a recent interview that RUSH felt they were at the pinnacle of their musical careers and are playing the best they ever have (paraphrasing from memory here).  I'd have to agree.  Clockwork Angels is simply amazing.  Geddy, Alex, and Neil sound as good as I've ever heard them, and for the record, I've have ALL the RUSH albums. Can't wait to see them LIVE in Toronto in October!!!  Kudos RASH!!!  Keep Rockin' It Boys!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can not tell my friends what the book is about and only tell them they must read the books, without ruining some of the suspense.  I was stunned with your courage at leaving the first book where you did, amazing work.  I think reading them individually would have left me frustrated and I was very happy with the pace and style.  There are not many books I hate and there are not many I love.  This is a contemporary Foundation series, but I would rate it higher then the earlier Foundation novels in my personal opinion this is outstanding work and if you do not have a publisher now and a big contract those people are fools.  Keep up the great work and I hope to see more!<br /><br />P.S.  I think this is my first review of any kind and I have read at least 5000 novels in my life so far.
B0050PYNO4|4.0|It is a good movie at a decent price. It has a couple of funny scenes that will make you laugh. You can get it cheaper at BestBuy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Can't say enough great things about these books!  Like everyone else who has discovered the series, I couldn't put it down.  His writing style is so wonderfully descriptive that I continually found myself feeling what the characters were feeling, from fear to hope to elation to utter loss; ive never encountered such great emotion portrayed in this type of story.  I'm just overall amazed at the entire world the author was able to create and cannot wait for more.
B0050PYNOY|5.0|This is a classic movie. It will have you laughing from start to finish. This movie can be found cheaper at BestBuy. I would suggest you get it there and save a couple of dollars.
B007R41E8O|5.0|fun game and vivid graphics.  well worth the money.  interesting story line so it keeps you engaged.  hopefully they will make more games.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy is totally captivating.  It will pull you in from the beginning and take you on an incredible ride.  Romance novels are not my usual choice but after hearing so much about it, I gave it a shot and fell in love with fifty shades.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game...mostly because its tricky and you can test yourself by putting on a certain amount of time and seeing how many puzzles you can do.
0765316994|3.0|John Scalzi's \\"Redshirts\\" is two approaches to the same meta-concept uneasily grafted together.  The first is a breezy, slight, but often fun screwball comedy about the titular characters, who discover that their coveted jobs on the flagship for the Federation,... er, Universal Union are in actuality just cannon-fodder sacrifices on a cheesy 21st century television program. As I said, it is slight, and the characters are cookie-cutter, perhaps intentionally, given their true nature, but there are many clever moments, especially late in the story where the characters take the initiative to change their lot in life. After the novel proper, there are three codas, taking characters we meet very late in the \\"novel.\\" (SPOILER ALERT: They are all people from the present day, and all involved with the TV show that is killing off the redshirts). These stories are unexpectedly moving, and take the loose ends cast aside frivolously in the novel proper to more cathartic, and occasionally philosophical ends. It was a nice surprise after the early hijinks, but I couldn't help feeling that I much rather would have seen these stories play out at novel length, more than the stories of the redshirts.<br /><br />These two approaches to the material sit side by side, and I understand and appreciate Scalzi's commitment to both the pulpier first part and the more literary second, but something about it doesn't quite work for me. The revelatory moments in the codas feel like afterthoughts, and unearned. Possibly an approach similar to David Mitchell's \\"Cloud Atlas,\\" which mixed up styles, eras, and characters, and split them into intermingled chapters, and created a structure that made sense of it all.  Or Tom Stoppard's play \\"Arcadia,\\" which ends up playing past and present simultaneously, might have made an interesting approach. As it is, it feels too much like John Scalzi had the original story, then thought about a few repercussions, fleshed them out a bit, and stopped there. A littlemore work, and he might have had a tale to rival the above mentioned works. Some stories don't know when to quit, but I think \\"Redshirts\\" maybe quit a little too fast in the process.
145162445X|4.0|A Universe from Nothing is a great read. Lawrence Krauss brilliantly explains the workings of our cosmos and is very entertaining. His new theory is fascinating!
B0044WWLMU|5.0|This was a fantastic buy- not only did the cd come with 3 extra songs- it also came with a DVD too! Pink is so awesome!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is addictive! It gets challenging. as it progresses, which makes it fun. I wish it kept my solutions in place instead of erasing them at each new board.

B007SGM084|5.0|I am completely in love with the Christian and Anastasia.  I could not put this book down. I am actually reading it again! What can I say it is worth the read, believe me you will not be disappointed.  ENJOY!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|I enjoy the game, but it is frustrating when it comes to the investment points. they are hard to earn, top &quot;goals&quot; require them, etc., etc. overall, it is fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an easy read, I could not put it down. The characters are very believable and realistic for the story line. Read it...unless your imagination is lacking, you will enjoy this story. Da G

B008MEM24S|5.0|Challenging enough for older kids but ready enough to keep younger kids interested.  Many of the agent characters and voices for children to recognize.
B00280LYHS|5.0|this is the best book ever!!! Rick is a real awsome writer,and this rocks the series!!! this also has a cool ending, which i like
B002RHGYOA|5.0|it's a really good story, the author its one of the best I have read, I am a mexican and the english its not hard to get. So its a very good option for every one who likes a thriller.
B004XWLN20|2.0|Greetings fellow amazonians I just wanted to warn others that Superman, yes the real one, rated this box set 5 stars. How in the world can he claim to be unbiased since he starred in the tv show. Amazon should not let the actual superhero rate his or her own products so to skew this precious rating system that we all love so much. I have downgraded my rating by two stars to offset what is a plant from Superman and I will stop purchasing any of his products knowing now how he does business.
0385344228|3.0|I liked most of this book. It build up slowly and kept me going. The ending was sort of a shocker and well done.  I was distracted by the overblown premise of the \\"murder gene\\" and had to mark it down. Didn't buy it the way it was presented.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|I got it for the price, not the best idea.<br /><br />with the battery works for a little bit and then goes off, it works okay for the guitar but when I try to tune my 5 strings bass doesn't hear the 5th string (I guess it's not a bass tuner) unless I play it after the 5th fret.<br /><br />It works better with a power adapter, luckily I had a spare one.<br /><br />As Dec 27<br /><br />It has been working fine with my guitar using the power adapter, so I'm gonna give it two more stars.  Still not good for Bass
0439813786|5.0|This book is a clever marriage of an understated adventure story with similarly spare pencil drawings.  The effect is powerful and haunting - and certainly couldn't be contained on a basic Kindle.  The kind of book you can enjoy as an adult or in sharing with kids.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|this is a fun game to play when you're bored or wanna pass some time. Its also sort of like temple run.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run it is the funnest game on my tablet. I love plying it in my spare time its addicting to me and I hope other people will love it too.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|if you need a calculator, get this app! it is really convenient.and easy to operate. simple but awesome! and perfect for all
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I enjoyed this movie as it is a quintessential example of the classic man vs. nature genre. Liam Neeson does an excellent job being a badass with some personal demons. My only real complaint is that the wolves are CG and more than a bit hokey, movie would have been %100 better with real wolves.
B008645YEE|4.0|The Dark Knight Rises score is another solid entry in the Batman movies but I will admit to missing James Newton Howard as at times this feels a little much like a 'standard' Hans Zimmer score.  I really do enjoy the new themes for Catwoman and Bane and anytime the Nolan Batman theme comes up it's always appreciated.  My enjoyment of the 3 scores is the same way I enjoy the 3 movies:  Batman Begins is my favorite, then The Dark Knight then The Dark Knight Rises (at least as of this writing).  It's a powerful score by Zimmer and a solid job.  Very dark and intense throughout for most of the soundtrack just like the movie.<br /><br />**** RECOMMENDED
B000A2IPP0|5.0|granddaughter #2, now 18 years old commented during a visit that she remembered watching ET and it scared her.  I ordered the movie so that we could revisit ET.  We did - we had many laugh's, oohs and aahs and she's not scared any more.  Thanks for the renewed memories!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|very good game and so easy to play. play it over and over again. even my children have been playing the game.

B005FVNIW6|3.0|I read the Kindle version of this after having seen it placed in the top 10 best science fictions novels of all time.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story even though it stretched credulity just a little too much for my liking (6 year old kids can be as smart as you like but will never be able to behave like people 10 years older...its something that only comes with experience).<br /><br />I imagine teenagers might like it better than someone a little older.<br /><br />It does illustrate how top 10 lists are very personal things. I would, for example, not even place it in my top 20 list let alone number 1 as many have done.<br /><br />I don't want to put anyone off reading it however. It's a good yarn and does keep the action moving.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|Excellent choice. The more you listen, the more you listen....  The style is a bit different, but definitely will appease your senses.
1250000971|4.0|This novel is the second installment of Jeffrey Archer's new series called the Clifton Chronicles.<br /><br />Only Time Will Tell is the first in the series and tells the tale of a family that will cross generations, oceans and very difficult situations. The first book begins with Harry Clifton, a dock worker's child who is born to Maisie Clifton. As he grows up he develops a talent for music which gets him a scholarship to an exclusive school. At the school he meets boys who are much richer than he but become very good friends of his. This book takes the reader through World War I and the outbreak of WWII when Harry has to decide whether to join the Navy or stay in school.<br /><br />The second book, The Sins of the Father, is very much a continuation of the first. It is best to read Only Time Will Tell first to gain an understanding of the characters and sitiuations. In the first book, Harry was about to marry Emma Barrington when they found out that the marriage would be a big mistake because Harry's parentage is questioned. He might be the son of Hugo Barrington, who had a one-nighter with Harry's mother. This would make Harry and his bride related so Harry decides to join the Merchant Marines rather than get married.<br /><br />When the ship Harry is on is torpedoed by a German U-Boat, Harry makes a quick decision to take the identity of a passenger who was killed. Why? Because Harry wants a new identity and wants to disappear into New York City. This turns out to be a big blunder because the passenger, Tom Bradshaw, is wanted for murder. Harry, thought to be Tom, is arrested and sent to prison. Now, Harry has more problems than he had before. Harry ends up in prison, serving the sentence that was handed down to Tom Bradshaw.<br /><br />Back in England, Harry's bride-to-be at the wedding that never happened, Emma Barrington, refuses to believe that Harry is dead and goes to America to prove that Harry is alive and to let him know that he has a son. Emma's brother, Giles, who is also Harry's best friend, joins the service of his country and becomes a war hero. This second novel in the series takes readers through WWII and we meet many characters who are both saints and sinners and readers will read avidly to see which sinner gets what he/she deserves and which saint will come up a winner.<br /><br />This is an excellent story, as Archer's stories always are however, it jumps around a lot and is a bit confusing at times. The reader will definitely have to read the books in sequence as not very much is explained - book two is continued on from book one without any explanation.er, Giles, who is also Harry's best friend, joins the service of his country and becomes a war hero.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|Ultraviolet and Flixster both suck.  Attempting to create an ultraviolet account and then linking the movie to it, well I've seen buggier programming, I just don't remember when.  With Ultraviolet you can't tell if you've been successful or not.  When you log in, it takes you to your account page.  Now, you have a problem because when you attempt to leave this page, it wants you to update your info including changing your password which you did last time you were stuck on this page. It just stubbornly refuses to let you leave gracefully, but tries to trap you in an endless loop.  Flixster gets to the part about having you log into your ultraviolet account to link the movie and then once you do, it just locks up on an empty box and refuses to let you continue.  And you have to have Flixster to link the movie to ultraviolet.  Terrible, just absolutely terrible!  The only good news is that the movie was fine.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I love the first movie and this one was great too, but just hit me slightly different.<br /><br />The scenes on the train were awesome. The witty dialogue between the characters Sherlock Holmes and Watson was amazing, but there are a lot more explosions and violence then I have ever read in the books.<br /><br />In fact, the books make for a much slower read but the movies have their own way of giving insight into the mind of Sherlock Holmes and stay true to the books in that respect.<br /><br />The music is awesome too. I am definitely getting the soundtrack to this movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The location thing for me is fine. It really is accurate, seems to mimic the weatherman. I would reccomend this app to anyone, I haven't had any problems so far.
B0086700CM|4.0|i really enjoy playing this game,  skips ever so often but great in general on my kindle fire and htc evo 3d 4g
0345803485|1.0|Really awful.<br />The author should just write a 500 word short-story erotica and not subject the reader to this horrifying attempt at a storyline. The plot is vapid drivel, the sex scenes insipid and repetitive, the characters have not one redeeming quality among them and their development is clumsy, at best.<br /><br />Won't be reading the next books and probably won't even finish his one.<br />Possibly the most poorly written book I've ever read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a pretty cool game it started out being for my kids until I tryed. to play it one day and I thought it was pretty cool so I would tell any body to get this game.
B008645YEE|5.0|Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard reinvented one of the most popular superheros of all time. Their score was so iconic and so defining that it shaped actions scores for years to come. They changed how superhero films were scored and almost every movie in Hollywood was temp tracked with their music. Hans Zimmer and Christopher Nolan built an amazingly perfect world for Inception. So much so that James Newton Howard didn't want to get in the way of their partnership and bowed out of the final chapter with no hard feelings. Zimmer tackled this beast solo after crafting what is one of the most iconic villain motifs in the Joker's one-note theme. For The Dark Knight Rises we get to experience the most visceral, intense and primal score Hans Zimmer has ever composed. There is nothing sweet and sensible about this. In pure Holst fashion he lays on the intensity thick and never lets up. The reason this review is late is because for the first time in my life I consciously decided to wait and hear one of Hans Zimmer's scores for the first time with the film and not on CD. The CD looked at me and mocked me on my desk for weeks. I almost buckled, but I'm glad I didn't. The score is a snowball that grows and grows until the final act when it steamrolls you into an emotional wreck. Pure fire burns within the sounds of this supremely aggressive listening experiences that is without a doubt one of Zimmer's finest accomplishments as a composer.<br /><br />Deh-Shay Deh-Shay Bah-Sah-Rah! This is the chant that echoes throughout the film and is the \\"rising\\" motif. Hans compiled thousands of voices from fans all over the world to make this chant. The score itself rarely touches back on its roots from the first two. Hans of course brings Batman's theme and boy when you first hear it in the film it raises hairs on the back of your neck. The score overall is extremely primal and percussion prevails in the soundscape. When the score gets loud it does get loud and I would safely bet this is the loudest mixed score I've ever heard in a film. If you thought Inception was loud then you're in for a surprise. It broods and bubbles as tension rises and when it finally breaks it has the power to melt your soul and then inject it with adrenaline. This is the most brilliantly executed action score I've ever heard and in that regard it's pure perfection. I found my heart rate increasing from just listening to the score again after seeing the movie, it has that much power over you. It infuses itself within you and when it rises so do you. Bane's character doesn't necessarily have a theme that the Joker had as Hans is more or less scoring our hero's struggle from the depth's. Selina Kyle's theme is one motif that manages to stand on its own and it's very well played. He does humanize the villain though and we actually feel empathy for Bane in the film. The brilliant part is that this score would be as perfect as it is even if the first two films never existed. It has that kind of standalone power. But since the first two films do exists it also serves as the last piece in the puzzle as the arc comes full circle. The ending is so emotional that Nolan just lets the music play in the film. Hans incorporates a lone boy vocal that is so simple, but so brilliantly touches on Bruce Wayne's character that when you make the connection in the final moments it can be overwhelming. The final track \\"Rise\\" closes everything out in brilliant fashion.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises is a charged adrenaline rush that will make you feel like you're running for your life while your knees are about to buckle from being emotionally drained. This is an exhaustingly thrilling experience that will stand the test of time as a benchmark in action scoring. Hans Zimmer didn't just give us the best superhero score of all time, but the best action score of all time. The sound of this film will be copied for years in the same way The Dark Knight and Inception were. This score has defined thegenre once again and has given us a rich character journey from Bruce's childhood to his journey's end. In sound Hans was able to capture terror, fear, shock, pain, yearning and the desire to overcome. The desire to rise. This score is perfect. From the rumblings I've been hearing though this shouldn't be the only release of this score. If I were you I'd bet on more coming real soon.genre once again and has given us a rich character journey from Bruce's childhood to his journey's end.

B00005JKDR|5.0|I loved the writing in this movie. It's an original adventure and appeals to kids and adults. The animation is outstanding and when we had our first movie scratched and destroyed in our last move, we went ahead and bought a second copy to keep in our collection.<br /><br />This movie is a must have in every movie library.<br /><br />Our children have loved watching the movie and I don't mind watching it over and over again.
B003B02OOG|4.0|Stories were unusual but interesting.  Not your typical Grisham book.  Found it entertaining however and would recommend it for a change of pace.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game keeps your mind going and it is a blast at the same time it also has a ton of levels and best of all it is free
B0071MV540|4.0|I saw Tower Heist when it was out in theaters, and I wanted to see it again because I remember thinking it was a good movie with a good story line. I enjoyed seeing it again, and may eventually just purchase it on DVD.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|At first I thought the game looked a tad childish but my friend begged me to download it... AWESOME choice. I found the whole game to be fun and colorful. I also liked how it is such a brain challenge. It also a tad addictive. I found myself playing on my kindle for quite a while. I think its a great app. If you like brain games its for you. I would deffinitly try it if you haven't:)
0374275637|4.0|I loved this book until golf came up.  Tiger Woods is more likely to make a 4' par put because, having been fooled on the 4' birdie effort, and while watching it roll 4' by, he got an up close look at the break and speed for his par effort.  A golfer usually has better up close information on speed and break for par puts.  There are rules against practicing during the round for this reason.  Also, pros consider 4s on the par 5s at Augusta pars--not birdies.  Very bad golf science!  Pretty good book.
0345529057|5.0|I must say, I expected the books to arrive in a worse state, since they crossed a whole ocean. But instead, they came in an almost perfect condition. Only a bit of damaging on the corners, which is perfectly normal for the distance it traveled. I still haven't read them, but I expect the quality of the books to be top notch too.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Awesome for a time killer get it now! it is just like where's my water but better! I highly reccomend this game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love how you get many games in one. it helps make room for more apps. I like this game.

B0001GMIOE|4.0|This battery is very hard to find. Most of them are knock-offs but this one seems to be 100% real, straight from Canon. I wish it were somewhat cheaper but I guess you get what you pay for. Overall it's what I was looking for so I am very pleased with my purchase.
1594744769|3.0|A friend and her almost 14 year-old recommended this book after we talked about other YA books we'd enjoyed. I am glad I got to this book before my 12.5 year-old daughter! Lots of bad words and an explicit sexual reference.... I am not easily offended but I don't think this book is appropriate for tweens and young teens. On top of that, it also didn't hold my interest as a story... too bad, I thought the photos were interesting!
B005HESGZ0|3.0|As the other reviewer mentions, this episode is missing sound effects. Which is too bad because it's a great episode. Hopefully Amazon will correct this at some point.
B006NXICT4|5.0|This book is filled with more than just a 'story line'... Each character is expanded on and padded out as the book progresses<br /><br />It has a similar style to Stepanie Meyers books in that the main female character is very internal - you can understand her deep thought processes throughout as she struggles to make sense of herself, her situation and what else is happening in her life.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who loves the genres of romance, action, and intrigue, as well as those that love novels that are based in dystopian worlds.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the movie was not very true to the book in many ways - I understand time constraints as well as wanting to keep a lower rating so the young people who read the books wouldn't have a problem in seeing the movie - but a lot of the symbolism and meaning was lost in the movie.  If possible, read this and the other two books BEFORE watching the movie as it is a lot more rich than what was put on the 'silver screen'!<br /><br />I have given it five out of five as I devoured this book, and downloaded the other two in the series in quick succession. Although the main character Katniss Everdeen is in her teens, at 28 years old I could still relate to her by the memories I have if being a teen, as well as by the insights I have as I have aged and matured. Again, there are two male love interests in the similar style of Stepanie Meyers, and created a feeling of \\"Team Peeta\\" and \\"Team Gale\\" - but you will have to read all three of the books to find out which love that Katniss chooses in the end.  In my opinion, this is the best book of the trilogy, the second I found was not as good and the third being better than the second - but without reading this one first, you cannot appreciate the other two fully because of the in depth explanations found in this first book that creates the world she lives in and the subtle power plays at work (both political, romantic and personal).<br /><br/>An awesome read, easy to get into and didn't want to put it down - so do yourself a favour and purchase this and the other two books today and immerse yourself in this futuristic dystopian world... It will make you think, and it can be related to the world we live in today.  It has been said that this book is a rip off of \\"Battle Royale\\" - and although there are some similarities, that is where it ends and this book is a best-seller in it's own right.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am really enjoying the game so far....looking forward to the new levels. really like that you can go back and play games you have already played to get more points!
B0086700CM|5.0|I really really love this game.I play this game all the time.I'll give you some advice.This game is so fun that temple run brave is so boring.
0345803485|1.0|I just read this terrible work. Or should I say I tried, suffered through first few chapters and threw it in the waste pale. For a serious reader, this is the worst piece of work I have ever read.  Do not purchase this book!<br />Ok lets start with how immature this writer is!  I think she is stuck at the level of a 10th grade girl!  The Grey character is so far beyond anything that could be real it is laughable. The sex scenes are a desperate cry of a women who has a very sad sex life herself and decisdes to write. Her poor husband.<br />As a business owner I can tell you if you have success you have to work your ass off, and there would be no time for all the other crap she has built into this character.<br />This book, if you can call it that, should be under \\"Young teen fantasy\\" book section!  Is this the state of what writing has become, we call this \\"great\\"????<br />Again do not waste your money.

0920668372|5.0|I was first introduced to this book in elementary when one of my teachers read this book to the class, and I have never forgotten it.  It always gave me the warm and fuzzies as a kid, and I was always a little sad at the end because the mom got sick.  But that just made me want to go hug my mom and dad, because it reminded me that they won't always be around.  Now that I'm a mom, it makes me want to hug both my parents and my kid because not only am I reminded that my parents are getting older, my baby won't always be a baby, and I should savour every moment.  I never got any creepy or incest vibes from this book, and maybe it was because I was a kid when I was first introduced to this book, and my teacher read it simply as a declaration of love from a parent to their child.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is fun and exciting you can do what ever you want and make whatever you want I would recamend this game

B007MJ9LA2|5.0|After Santana's previous albums with other artists and re-do's of classic rock songs, this comes as a welcome surprise. Santana doesn't need to colaborate with anyone else, because Carlos and his brilliant musicians are much better standing on their own. The more I listen to it, the more I like it. I am sure this music would be great live. Carlos, how about a live Blu-Ray with some tracks off this album plus a few from the old masterpiece, Caravanserai. Add in Bella, I'll be waiting and One with you and hey!, you have a classic.
B006C45MRE|2.0|It could have been great but it was not.  The cast was great.  The concept could have been great but it took most of the movie for the cowboys to get to and attack the aliens and the aliens themselves were a letdown.  I hear the graphic novel was better, if no less cheesy.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|This movie never tries to be anything but a brutal, visually appealing action movie in the same vein of the 300, Scorpion King, Conan the Barbarian, etc. and those who are disappointed by it for not treading new ground are unbearably pretentious jerks. Just shut up and enjoy the movie (you know you did). It doesn't have to break new ground to be a good movie. Honestly, we live in a world where movies like Chronicles of Riddick get lambasted by critics while sweeping up at the box office, and movies like Brokeback Mountain get the Oscars because anal sex and cowboys is so classy and original. Puh-lease.

B006OAB3ME|2.0|I have been a Beatle/Paul fan as long as I can remember.  Besides the obvious great tunes he did early in his solo career and his venture with Wings, I have liked such recent work as Chaos and Creation in the Backyard.  However, this album is reminiscent of Frank Sinatra doing My Way long after he had peaked.  Paul sounds old and tired and it is a huge letdown from the man I heard at Wrigley Field last year.  If you truly like Paul and admire his previous work, do not listen.  Johnny Cash had a draw at the end, this is just sad.

B000P0J0A6|1.0|i bought this movie because of the cute cover, thinking it would be great for my kids. turns out its the scariest movie theyd ever watched, creeping them out for weeks to the point where they cant sleep in their own bed. i wish i could give it zero stars. not only is it absolutely terrifying and insanely creepy, even for me, a grown man, but the acting and special effects is so poorly done that i was laughing, which seemed to be the only comedic part of the film. i got this movie for two bucks, and it wasnt even worth that. it is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen. the worst parts are when the gremlins are having a huge party with inappropriate drinking and smoking, when the girl tells her horrific christmas eve story about how her father died in the chimney pretending to be santa, and when the narrator tells us at the end that \\"there might be a gremlin in your house\\" which put my children in tears. words cant describe the hatred i have for this movie.

B004UMVW7E|5.0|This is the paperback I own and have read many times.  Hesse's Siddhartha is a story that once read will not soon be forgotten.<br /><br />Siddhartha tells us: \\"I can think; I can fast; I can wait.\\"  And in the end, as Siddhartha sits by the river watching it, feeling its rhythms, listening to its gentle sounds, his patience is rewarded.  He becomes one with his surroundings and finds \\"the peace that passes all understanding.\\"  He has become a Buddha, an awakened one.<br /><br />Everthing Siddhartha has been searching for in his life he has found in himself as he sat quietly by the river and connected to his surroundings.  He has found The Way.  \\"Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.  Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations.\\"<br /><br />We have taken the journey with Siddhartha as he leaves his father's house and his princely heritage to learn about suffering and the means to relieve it.  He becomes an ascetic and tortures his body; this brings him close to death, but not the answers he seeks.  He turns to wealth and pleasure and again is frustrated and unhappy.  He turns to the Buddha, but Siddharth discovers that even though the Buddha is great and enlightened, Siddhartha must find his own answers and continues on his way until he meets a ferryman by the river who allows Siddhartha to become his helper.  The ferryman has no teaching like the Buddha, but Siddhartha discovers that the life of the ferryman gives him the example that he needs to look within himself to discover what is real and the courage to discard his illusions.<br /><br />Readers, I among them, have loved this little book since its publication.  It is a story, not a course or a program of study.  We walk with Siddhartha and watch as he experiences life and attempts to learn from it.  We know that our own journey will yield different lessons, but we sometimes can learn from our association with a friend like Siddhartha, and in truth, this is just what happens.<br /><br />For those first time readers, you have a treat in store for you that you will not soon forget and will most likely repeat, as I have, from time to time when it feels right to walk with our friend, Siddhartha.me readers, you have a treat in store for you that you will not soon forget and will most likely repeat, as I have, from time to time when it feels right to walk with our friend, Siddhartha.

1583334386|5.0|This is actually my third purchase of this book.  I have the Kindle and audio versions as well.  It's an excellent self-help book based on solid research that the author has thoughtfully interpreted into highly understandable and relevant strategies for improving well-being.  I have a doctorate in education, so am very accustomed to reading behavioral research, and often find that there is a notable gap between theory and reality.  What works in the lab or in an experimental setting isn't always all that easy to translate into practice.  Theories are usually lots of fun to talk about and consider, but for my money, experience talks!  This book is a very rare case.  The author very effectively merges research and experience so that the reader benefits from BOTH.  That is priceless!  The information in this book has completely changed my own life - I am finally getting a handle on a lifelong addiction to sweets!  Hallelujah!  Plus, I can already think of many applications for helping my students with these strategies.<br /><br />Also a side note - if anyone is turned off by the term \\"willpower\\" (as I was), I would encourage you to read this anyway.  To me, \\"willpower\\" brings up negative connotations of forcing myself to do something I'd rather not do, but that isn't the definition used in this book.  Willpower is actually our ability to do what we WANT for ourselves, so it might also be called \\"motivation.\\"  I like that term better, but also got used to \\"willpower\\" (and \\"won't power\\" and \\"want power\\" as the author calls them) as I read.  Give it a shot!  You won't be sorry!

B004DLPXAO|4.0|Used to I had to cart 5 or 6 books with me on trips and if I really liked them I had to bring them back with me. With this Kindle for Android app I can have as many books as I want, read them all and buy more. I love books, but this is so space friendly! I no longer need to worry about space, weight, or running out of books. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I often find typos; sometimes reversals, or combining groups of words, missing words, but you can still read and understand the stories.
0812992792|2.0|Dreary Book about Hell On Earth aka NORTH Korea. If you want to spend time reading about a make believe rendition of what life is like among the saddest and most terrible place on earth = this is the book for you. Just read any news report about this place and read the story about Lloyd Buchers imprisoinment there - and you know  North Korea is ruled by insane sadists who use an incredible process of terror to keep control on the population.<br /><br />The author just uses his imagination - to depict how it all works out in this terrible place. Instead of reading this book you should pray for the poor souls that live here.<br /><br />Too bad that the Korean War ended with leaving these madmen in charge AND thank God we saved the South Koreans from The North Koreans.
1435276930|5.0|Having walked the streets of Delft, this story felt like it took place right there. Although it's fiction, constructing the \\"girl\\" with the pearl earring, it goes a long way to bring Vermeer to life in his time, in his town and in his own home.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes from the book is:<br /><br />\\"There is a difference between Catholic and Protestant attitudes toward painting,\\" he [Vermeer] explained as he worked, \\"but it is not necessarily as great as you may think. Paintings may serve a spiritual purpose for Catholics, but remember too that Protestants see God everywhere, in everything. By painting everyday things--tables and chairs, bowls and pitchers, soldiers and maids--are they not celebrating God's creation as well?\\"<br /><br />The story makes it clear that Vermeer converted from Protestantism to Catholicism, and it is reflected in his work. But this is far from being a theological work. However it piqued my interested to learn more about Vermeer and his views on art and faith.<br /><br />I saw this film many years ago, and plan to see it again. I'm glad that I finally got around to reading this novel, so I can appreciate the film even more next time around.

B00899DR40|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this album is. I agree with another reviewer - you can truly listen all the way through without skipping a single track. I don't really understand how someone could give this album 1 star. If it's just not your kind of music, then that's just more of a preference thing, and not something that warrants a bad review. Or, if you bought the album for someone else and listened to it and didn't like it, once again, that shouldn't reflect negatively upon the artist. I'm glad Amazon had such a great price on this album (as always) and I give it five stars. No, it's not the best music in the world, and is not something that should be compared to classical or Whitney Houston, or Dixie Chicks. But for it's own genre, and given the age and career stage of the artist, it's high quality production and singing, and the album exceeds expectations. Buy it if you enjoy this type of music!
0345536886|3.0|I think I have read every one of John Grisham's novels.  Some are better than others, but I have enjoyed them all.  The Litigators has some of the elements that make Grisham fun to read: the idealistic young lawyer, the bashing of big firms and big companies, the little guy getting the win.  But I have to say, even though I enjoyed it, I kept asking myself why.<br /><br />I don't know if this is a criticism or an observation, but after the first few chapters, The Litigators reads more like an account of an actual case.  You know, one of those readable but ultimately pretty dry nonfiction works that tell the story of a case from the news or from history?  It starts out on an entertaining note.  David Zinc, sick of working 80 hours a week in a big firm making deals on foreign fixed income instruments, flips out, gets drunk, and, after seeing an ad on a bus for an ambulance-chasing law firm, shows up there looking for a job.  He, along with the two colorful and ethically-challenged partners, gets involved in a class action suit against a giant pharmaceutical company.<br /><br />Once that case, which fills most of the book, gets going, Grisham's lawyer takes over for his storyteller.  This certainly may be his intent.  If there's a good case in real life, with a good story behind it, I would want Grisham to write that book.  It's generally considered a good thing when a work of non-fiction reads like a work of fiction.  But I would counter that when a work of fiction sounds like a work of non-fiction, perhaps a bit more life needed to be injected into the story.<br /><br />Yeah, I know, that sounds pretty shallow and petty, but that's my opinion.  Two things: Grisham fans will like The Litigators, and, in spite of my criticism, I'll probably read his next book as soon as it's released.

B000YAA68W|5.0|It is hard to find words to express the beauty of this animated film. The cover picture and description do not do it justice.<br /><br />Yes, it is the story of a girl coming of age in post-Revolutionary Iran, but it is so much more than that. Any woman could identify with this, perhaps any man, as well. It is a universal story of being young, of growing up, of discovering love, of discovering virtue, of finding oneself.<br /><br />The simple animation is startlingly effective and successfully conveys a wide range of moods and emotions from horror to humor. The brief, understated visions of war and its destruction -- blessedly free from sentiment, gore, or propaganda -- tear at the heart. The funny scenes were laugh-out-loud hilarious and a credit to the sensitive pen of the artist -- Marjane's exposure to punk rock brought back memories and had me laughing till I choked. Oh, and that exquisitely beautiful memory of her grandmother and the jasmine flowers ... What a lovely, intimate, and surprising tribute to a beloved lady.<br /><br />Despite not knowing more than a few words of French, I almost forgot that I was watching a subtitled movie as I eagerly drank in the simple story.<br /><br />It's so good to see animation used as an art form rather than just as a way of making little kids think they're having fun!<br /><br />It's also nice to see a really great film from a female director. I want to see more from this woman!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I can understand that many who walk into the theatre to see The Dark Knight Rises do so with incredibly high expectations, believing that to be a success the movie must somehow beat the odds and find a way to eclipse its predecessor.  I must confess I did not walk in with this thought.  I never expected (or even hoped for) better, I simply wanted a new and different experience comparable in quality with the films that came before it, the way The Dark Knight was when compared to Batman Begins.  I am not sure there will ever be another comic book villain portrayed as brilliantly on film as the Joker in TDK, and I felt it unrealistic to even expect such.  Still, I did go in expecting an amazing film, epic in its scale and one that would deliver a satisfying conclusion to Bruce Wayne's arc in this trilogy.  I am happy to say TDKR not only met, but in fact exceeded, these expectations.<br /><br />The film has an excellent  story, and as an old time comic book fanboy (I still remember reading the first Ra's Al Ghul story arcs) even I was surprised at some of the beats literally lifted from the comics.  That may sound like a bit of a rip off, but in this case the spin Nolan puts on these scenes makes them often more visceral, accessible and believable.  As with the entire trilogy, this movie was like seeing some of my favorite Batman stories literally spring to life, but in a world much like ours rather than in some hyper-reality ripped from the comic book page.  The thrill I feel at this cannot be justly expressed in words.  I have really enjoyed many of the comic book films of the past several years, but this one still serves as notice to the rest of the superhero movie community that they are, by comparison, more or less making live-action animated movies.<br /><br />The performances, already discussed ad nauseam in many other reviews, are great.  I do believe there are two that stand out just a bit from the rest, with Christian Bale's finest performance of the trilogyas well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt's exceptional turn as police officer John Blake.  Anne Hathaway was very impressive as \\"cat burglar\\" Selina Kyle and I felt Tom Hardy's Bane was everything the story needed him to be: imposing, intelligent and merciless.<br /><br />I have read many criticisms of the film, but for me those boil down to nit-picks and likely too much comparison to TDK.  It is long, but those nearly 3 hours fly by.  Yes it does go to some dark territory, but honestly those who were put off by this should really read some of the arcs in the comics that make this movie look downright cheery by comparison (in other words, the story is true to the character).  I do agree there was a lot of character development, which likely could have been done more effectively over the course of two movies.  On the other hand, credit the Nolans for always putting all they've got into each of these films.<br /><br />Taken on its own merits, TDKR is an excellent film, with awesome pacing and a memorable story that really hit the mark.  As part of what is now my favorite trilogy of all time (sorry George, that episode six is a wart on the OT that only gets worse with your tampering), it is an outstanding conclusion to Nolan's epic Batman tale.  This is a trio of movies that, for me, are simply without peer.
0307887448|5.0|What a game!  I don't consider myself a gamer, although I wasted plenty of hours with my Atari 2600 and later with a Nintendo.  Now I play with my kids sometimes on their Wii and PS3, but it doesn't quite have the appeal as it once did.  Ready Player One is a novel for gamers, especially for those who fondly remember those Atari 2600 days, but the story will draw in non-gamers as well.<br /><br />In Ernest Cline's world, about 3 decades in the future, the internet has become a virtual reality environment.  It started with the OASIS, an online game, which became the standard operating system/ web browser/ social environment for virtually everyone.  The creator of the OASIS, game programmer James Halliday, a fabulously wealthy, childless recluse, hid an \\"Easter egg\\" somewhere in the OASIS and, when he died, had a video released in which he stated that whoever finds the Easter egg would inherit his fortune.  The hunt would require an encyclopedic knowledge of 1980s pop culture, including video games, TV shows, movies, music, and more.  The world goes crazy for 1980s fashion and culture, as everyone would love to have a piece of that fortune.<br /><br />Cline's protagonist, Wade Watts, known in the OASIS as Parzival, is about to finish high school, and as a poor orphan in a bleak world, lives in the OASIS as an escape.  He has dedicated the 5 years since the start of the contest to learning every bit of Halliday's favorite 1980s culture.  Finally, he has a flash of inspiration and becomes the first person to find the first clue, making him not only an overnight celebrity, but also the target of a ruthless corporation with the aim of taking over Halliday's company.<br /><br />Ready Player One makes for a fun read, a roller-coaster ride of Wade's adventures, avoiding threats both virtual and real-life.  A child of the 1980s will love some of the tasks he has to perform in his search, like playing the Matthew Broderick character in an interactive version of War Games (if he misses a line, he loses points; luckily Wade has watched the movie enough that he has it memorized) or playing against Halliday's avatar in the arcade classic Joust.  All of his research pays off time and again.  Many of the cultural references, on which the story hinge, will be lost to readers older or younger than Halliday's generation, but it's still a fun story.<br /><br />This is a fun read, sure to satisfy readers like me, fans of Cory Doctorow, and players of online multi-player games.  I'm sure it will make a great movie, coming to theaters sometime in 2012.  In the meantime, let your imagination run wild as you picture life in the OASIS, where you can drive a time-traveling DeLorean, go to school exclusively in a virtual reality school, fly your own X-wing fighter, and make your virtual living room look just like the one on Family Ties.

055357342X|3.0|I just finished Storm of Swords and while I will keep reading this series, but will probably not ever re-read this series.  The writing is good, the characters are realistic, and that is the problem.  If Martin didn't get me emotionally invested in the characters, I wouldn't keep reading.  While as the Wheel of Time Series, I have re-read some of the books 3 or 4 times (mainly to catch up) and will eventually re-read the entire series, probably in 15 years or so.  I will compare Martin's books to early Real World/Road Rules episodes, these show suck, but you want to see what happens to the people.<br /><br />In this book (and the other two) that character you like - dies, that one you hate - dies, that other one you hate - lives, and that one who you aren't sure is bad or good, might be dead, but might not.  I have figured out who the three or four continuing characters will be, but who knows with Martin.<br /><br />I guess the other thing that bugs me about this series is that it paints a really bad picture of humanity.  Most everybody is out for themselves and will forsake family and friends to achieve their goal, even if their goal will inevitably cause their own pain and suffering.  No good deed goes unpunished.  I don't expect roses and knights on white horses, but I think he goes overboard.
0380807343|5.0|I say that not only because this is a well-written book -- a stylistically elegant, witty, creepy, whimsical little tome packed with scary fun -- but because there is more to it than meets the eye. It's not just a successfully executed kiddie thriller, it's a slim lesson in the development of virtue. Don't believe me? Look at what Coraline learns in the course of the book:<br /><br />1. Truth is better than appealing illusions.<br />2. Imperfect, annoying, absentminded people who truly love you are better than grinning poseurs who kiss your bum.<br />3. Cats are walking reservoirs of wisdom and good advice.<br />4. Happiness is not possible in an existence in which all one's desires are met.<br />5. Be scared and do what needs to be done anyway.<br />6. Go ahead and eat Dad's scary gourmet creations without complaining. They're not that bad!<br /><br />And he does all this in proper storytelling fashion with no preaching and without being too obvious. I'm impressed!<br /><br />The illustrations are good and surprisingly frightening, as well.<br /><br />I hadn't read anything by Gaiman since greatly enjoying his Sandman comics almost 20 years ago. It's good to see that this author understands the child mind as well as the adult one.

B002G01EPC|5.0|I am one of those guys who collects figures. I own several different brands of these high quality, extremely detailed figures so I know what I'm talking about, you can trust me.<br /><br />This is a review on S H Figuarts' Piccolo from Dragonball Z. Piccolo is awesome. I know it, you know it. I picked up this figure for a good price, and I don't regret it. I have him on my self head down with his hand to forehead, as if doing his signature move \\"Special Beam Cannon\\"<br /><br />The box he comes in is larger than some of the other SHF figures, almost as big as SS3 Goku. he does not come with a stand or effect parts like SS3 Goku, but he does come with his cape. It looks awesome, with those spiky shoulder pads. his arms are removable which is great considering Piccolo loses his arm several times in the Anime, then they grow back. The reason his arms come off is because he comes with a part that makes it look like the is crossing his arms.<br /><br />This figures uses the colors in the manga, not the anime, which some will not like. for example his belt and wristbands are red instead of blue, and his muscles, or umm... the parts that aren't green and are usually pink, are yellow to match the eternal dragon. Oh yeah, his boots are brown instead of orange.<br /><br />This figure matches Gohan, but not the new SDCC Gohan that just came out, which uses anime colors, just FYI<br /><br />Like all the S H Figuarts I recommend picking this up, however this figure's price skyrocketed recently. If you want this you should look around, maybe do some searching to get the best deal.

0345522303|3.0|Sixth book in the Nightrunner series, following [[ASIN:055359009X The White Road (Nightrunner)]].  New readers could treat this as a stand-alone adventure, but many details won't make sense unless you've read the preceding books, particularly [[ASIN:0553577255 Traitor's Moon (Nightrunner, Vol. 3)]].  Some spoilers follow.<br /><br />It's summer in Rhíminee, Skala's mighty capital city.  Seregil and Alec are living the high life of wealthy nobles, socialising and partying even as the city becomes increasingly stressed by the distant war with Plenimar and the influx of refugees.  Yet they are also Watchers, charged with defending the Crown, so when plots against the royal family begin to materialise and a mysterious plague strikes, they employ all their skills at spying, subterfuge and fighting to unravel these mysteries before disaster hits and the personal cost to them becomes even higher.  But the key to so many deadly events lies in a direction they never expected.<br /><br />You should like this if you want 1) more of Seregil and Alec no matter what, or 2) an imaginative, city-based, adventure story with plenty of action and intrigue that's an easy read and you aren't particularly fussed about the fine detail.  There's a lot going on and plenty of fantasy trimmings.<br /><br />After the disappointments of Shadows Return and The White Road I didn't expect much from The Casket of Souls.  I did hope for it, though, so despite myself I was rather disappointed by this.<br /><br />Up to a point I really did find this book fun and promising, as it seemed that truly significant events were taking shape and I was enjoying the process of discovery and the introduction of new elements, such as Princess Elani and court society.  But once the two Rhíminee-based plots came together and it became clear that a huge chunk of the plot had no consequences and was merely obfuscation to delay Seregil and Alec's tracking down the real villain, the book lost me.  It's never a good sign when a spy/law enforcement story has you continually asking yourself \\"but why didn't the characters do this?\\" or \\"why haven't they already done that?\\"  Nor is it a good sign when there seems to be so much that supposedly expert spies never notice, question or think of.  It undermines the characters and the plot and so overall, I found myself with a story that was longer than it needed to be, didn't show the characters to their best advantage and had no real payoff in the end.<br /><br />Indeed, for me the whole plot had a perfunctory feel to it.  The war didn't feel real and seemed little more than a convenient way to make certain things happen.  Neither of the two intrigues that Seregil and Alec investigated were fully explained or wrapped up.  So many of those killed off were just names that their deaths had no impact.  The ultimate villains had no motivation beyond being evil and their power had no explanation.  Lots of minor details were wrong, didn't mesh or simply went nowhere.<br /><br />These flaws have been scattered throughout Flewelling's previous books, to a degree, but I found them far harder to overlook this time; in part because they were genuinely more significant, but mostly because I found myself emotionally disengaged from the story.  Flewelling kept telling me how much this mattered to the characters but I didn't feel it.  Seregil and Alex felt somewhat distant from the plot, even from each other; it seemed a story they happened to be in, rather than a story that was fully theirs.  I was also disturbed by out-of-character violence, in particular Micum murdering someone in a frenzy and Alec ready to kill law enforcement officers just for doing their job.<br /><br />There was an occasional clunky feel to the prose, especially with the overuse of commas and the way dialogue is framed (and I felt like throwing the book across the room every time I read yet another repetition of \\"Alec told him\\"); Flewelling is certainly capable of much better.  Thesudden crudities really jarred.  Flewelling still thinks battles last for hours and hours and that it's possible to split one arrow already stuck in a target with another.  I guess she doesn't watch Mythbusters, then.  Beka's promotion scene was just crass, and in combination with a number of other factors that have now been resolved gave the book something of a clearing-the-decks feel.<br /><br />If there is to be another entry in this series, especially one that takes it in a new direction, I imagine I'll read it - the characters and setting do offer a lot, the plots are always imaginative and some of the previous books really have been very good indeed - but like I said above, I just don't expect much anymore.  To experience Flewelling at her best, read [[ASIN:0553575422 Luck in the Shadows (Nightrunner, Vol. 1)]] and [[ASIN:0553575430 Stalking Darkness (Nightrunner, Vol. 2)]].<br /><br />Rated PG-13.<br />Language: one instance of bad language<br />Violence: significant and with consequences, but not graphic<br />Sex: minor sex scenes (including homosexual) but not graphic, glamorised prostitution
B007REW8DO|5.0|I have purchased about 6 CD's lately, and this is by far my favorite. I was listening to her sing the background music  on my soap, the Bold and Beautiful, and fell in love with her voice. It has a very Haunting quality to it.  I would highly reccomend this
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a fun new game, 18 years old and I love it. I'm glad I down loaded it.everyone needs to try this
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|ok I rated this game 3 stars because it was fun for 3 days then it got kinds boring because u had to check it 20times a day and u had to buy things with real money
B007TNS6JI|1.0|So...take everything you loved about dungeon hunter, throw it out the window, then slam your hand in a door and headbutt an axe. All of the fun loot finding, exploration, combat, customization you loved is gone. Like ranged characters? Sucks to be you, you're going to be strafing and shooting at nothing a lot because there's no targeting. Choose a melee class, spam attack as you get one special until you grind for days to get another move while trying to also get gear with that same gold. Progress further, and you get the privelage of spending weeks farming for gold to buy another boring piece of gear. Or you can have the great joy of spending real money on in-game items. Even if you do that, you're still stuck with a boring, soulless, broken, and awful game. Go back to the old formula Gameloft, I understand trying to nickel and dime casual gamers, but this is the entirely wrong avenue for it. Please don't ruin Dungeon Hunter 4. I beg of you.
0143119680|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this book!  To say that it's paranormal because the main characters are witches, vampires, and daemons completely disregards the fact that is at once a book about history, family, science, romance, and personal metamorphosis.  It's a thriller, in the tradition of Dan Brown, but true literature; something to sink your teeth into.  If you're not a fan of the paranormal genre, please try it anyway.  If you are a fan, there will be enough to love this as it is far and away the best book I've ever read along those lines.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love this book, can't wait for 2nd one. I was bummed that it won't be out until October but I know it will be worth the wait!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is a lot of fun and hard to put down. I don't want to rush through all of the levels because I want to be able to play it for a while!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game if I'm bored I play it all the time its better than where's my water goodjob
B005STGJDA|4.0|The original CD is about as brickwalled sound-wise as they come.  The vinyl is better just not stunningly better.  More mid-range and a bit more dynamic, I suppose.  Most noteable on songs like \\"My Poor Brain\\".  I will listen to the LP more than the CD (but the bonus tracks on the CD are tasty).  Packaging-wise, there is just the cover, no gatefold or anything.  Decently quiet vinyl. Cymbals are still plenty bright.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely LOVED these books, so happy to be done with them but also a little sad...I would be interested in reading a book or two from his point of view as well.
B000FC1AOI|5.0|Could not put the book down. Much better than the movie. A beautiful sensitive love story. Romantic, but bitter sweet.
B000022TSW|5.0|I saw this movie on Comedy Central about a month ago, and I loved it! I just recently found out it was sold on the Comedy Central website, so I bought it and it's absolutely amazing~!! &lt;3 ^-^
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app! The melodies are great, I just wish they had a louder thunderstorm one and that it can play while you're in other apps. But other than that it's pretty perfect :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! Great trilogy read!! I love all the ways they find a way to love each other and keep overcoming their fears!! Not what I would usually read but so glad I stepped out of the comfort box and into the \\"Red Room\\"!!
B004R1Q296|5.0|History made alive by a great writer. To bad I didn't have her as a teacher I would have loved history!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a brilliant puzzle game that will drive you absolutely nuts when you can't figure out a puzzle. I love playing this game in my free time. It's a definitley must try.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|To begin with, this app is amazing. It gives you goals to meet and while you are trying to meet them you have a fun time collecting money, playing Kung-fu Scrat, and increasing your points to change levels to unlock cool things to increase your rating. You can also play with friends by inviting them through facebook and other social networks. I have never had an issue with this app and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a virtual adventure.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Great read - takes you totally by surprise as to where the story is going to go. Give your hubbies a treat ladies & read this book - they will love you for it!!
B005LAIH5O|5.0|this is great movie i liked it better than the first but still falls short from the first harry hamlin CLASH OF THE TITANS, that one had an adventure feel to it, but this one took a different direction totally and had some originallity to it, i liked it...the seller was fast shipping to me....thanks.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Where do I begin? This was a great book for so many reasons.<br /><br />After reading the fifty shades trilogy, I've been reading a lot of books with the same formula. Screwed up guy, sleeps with everyone until he meets the girl who makes him want to change. It was really refreshing to see how Will Cooper started out a good guy, how takes care of his younger brother and supports him with no regrets after his parents died, loves poetry. The love story between Will and Lake along with the other hardships they will bring on quite a few tears throughout the book, since the characters are so likable you feel like your part of the story, hoping and praying they have a happy ending.<br /><br />Really loved this book.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This app gets you thinking about gravity and other laws of physics you have to use to get the water to go were you want it.  I find I have trouble putting it down.  Good investment for your 99 cents!
B007UXT6T6|2.0|Other than the action sequences which were good, the movie has a very thin plot and generally was not worth my time. I would not recommend.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I don't know when was the last time I picked up a pen or pencil and took notes on actual paper.  App may be a gift and curse for traditional notetaking.  Either way this is a great app!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is the best game in all the app store and its free so I would get it but it does restart for some reason pleez fix it
B001IF277K|5.0|My Sony Ericsson Xperia x10 is just over 2 years old, with a 3-year contract with my carrier. But my battery was dying and I could only get less than a few hours of usage out of it before it shuts down. If I had to purchase a new phone, it would cost me several hundred dollars. But this $9.99 battery saved me from all that. My 2-year old phone, although slow compared to my kids' newer smartphone, is still one of my favourite phones out there, and I was able to extend its life because of this battery.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Read the trilogy...worst $30 I ever spent. Kept thinking each book would have more depth to it,but that never happened. Read like a Cinderalla porn story...junk. Save your money- I wish I had!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I cannot stop playing this game. This is the most addictive game ever. This game is really easy and fun to play.
B007SGM084|2.0|I was very excited to read this after hearing reviews from many friends, co-workers and not to forget the media.  I ordered the trilogy, thinking I most definitely would read all three books. I'm baffled by the hype.  The books are poorly written and the characters unlikable. Had I only purchased the first book, I would not have bothered with the other two. Outside of their amorous relationship, there's not much to the characters. I was very disappointed.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I literally read this is one sitting. ('cept for stretching, potty breaks and to get some grub!) lol I then had to buy the next book in the series and read 1/4 of it before I couldn't keep my eyes open and sleep claimed me......try it, I think you'll like it!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet: read it.  Worth every penny of the $2.99 price tag.  It is more closely worth $12.99.  Excellent writing, interesting story, engaging characters.  Well done all around.  With a little publish house polishing it'd be a best seller in the Fantasy community.  Just a great job done.  Can't wait for the next one.
034580404X|5.0|I heard so many great things about this series so i had to see if they were true...and they are!!
B003QNXPUK|1.0|Just the worst screen protector i ever buy<br />It just felk from the screen very easy and the side protectors don't fit in the iphone 4s
B008JGSM6G|5.0|REALLY LOVE THIS GAME! Thought it was going to be a simple connect the dots type of game, but it's not. Starts off simple, then becomes more challenging to play. Makes you think through each step to connect the pipes and not leave any void spaces. Really like how it adds another color pipe as you progress from level to level. VERY ADDICTIVE AND QUITE ENJOYABLE GAME!!
B0086700CM|1.0|its stupid because when I had 5000 coins and next time I play I have 56 coins and there is a big gap and how am I repost to jump over that.
0345803485|5.0|Never received the book, it got lost in the mallroom at work but it's a good read I was able to read a coworkers.
0307592731|5.0|Story Description:<br /><br />Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group March 20, 2012 Hardcover ISBN: 978-0-307-59273-6<br /><br />Oprah's Book Club 2.0 selection.<br /><br />A powerful, blazingly honest memoir: the story of an eleven-hundred-mile solo hike that broke down a young woman reeling from catastrophe - and built her back up again.<br /><br />At twenty-two, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything.  In the wake of her mother's death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed.  Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to hike the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State - and to do it alone.  She had no experience as a long distance hiker, and the trail was little more than \\"an idea, vague and outlandish and full of promise.\\"  But it was a promise of piecing back together a life that had come undone.<br /><br />Strayed faces down rattlesnakes and black bears, intense heat and record snowfalls, and both the beauty and loneliness of the trail.  Told with great suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humour, Wild vividly captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.<br /><br />My Review:<br /><br />This was a phenomenal memoir!  A page-turner that I read in a day and a half packed full of drama, suspense, emotion, and great fortitude.  Cheryl Strayed showed unbelievable strength in pushing herself to the limit on this solo walk of eleven-hundred miles across the Pacific Crest Trail.  Her ability to stare down the pain of her feet during her walk was unbelievable.  That alone would have forced me to give up.<br /><br />Wild is a memoir you won't soon forget nor will the character that Cheryl showed during this incredible solo journey.  I'll most definitely be recommending this to everyone.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|I'm using this for my Camcorder Canon M50, it's about half an inch short using the battery that came with the camera, but it can still close especially if the velcro is a little longer.  The velcro is only sticking to each other half way, but since it's a strong \\"stick\\", it can still close and protect the camera properly.  The padding is thicker than I tought, I wouldn't drop the camera with this case because it isn't impact resistant, but if you do drop it, it will absorb some impact into the padding.  The case is very light weight and has SOFT inner linings.  It comes with a strap and it looks pretty well made.  This case would be too big for a typical point and shoot camera
B003TSEL7S|3.0|ok this was a book that really let me down. right off the bat not a single thing made sense. then the main heroine didn't even fight plus she was jason's&#34; number one fan&#34;. this book needed a better explaination and more in deph characters. huge letdown.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series has everything! Drama, Action, & pinch of comedy. It keeps you wanting more. Be careful, you could finish it in one day, force yourself to pace yourself to enjoy a slow sexy ride.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|Ip Man Legend of the Grandmaster is a wonderful movie...The moves are in wing chun..but it is a movie ..it arrived fast. thank you
