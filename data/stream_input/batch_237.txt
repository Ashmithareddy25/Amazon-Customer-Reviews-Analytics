0792148061|5.0|I have seen &quot;Grease&quot; performed on stage (a dinner theater still counts as a stage, people), so I have a great appreciation for how it was turned into a big screen musical.  Actually, &quot;Grease&quot; was the movie that proved the musical was not dead, although it did not really inspire the rebirth of the musical (One word: &quot;Xanadu&quot;).  Sweet All-Australian girl Sandy Olsen (Olivia Newton-John) had a summer romance with greaser Danny Zucko (John Travolta), and now at Rydell High he is too caught up with his cool dude image to admit he really, really likes her.  Travolta puts his charm into overdrive while Newton-John looks so darn cute and perky you might not be able to stand it, but Stockard Channing as Rizzo steals this movie in my book (&quot;There Are Worst Things I Could Do&quot;).  For the most part the choreography by Patricia Burch (who would get the opportunity to direct &quot;Grease II&quot;) is better than the songs and the songs are not half-bad.  However, my favorite will always be &quot;Beauty School Dropout&quot; sung by Teen Angel Frankie Avalon, which might be as funny a tongue-in-cheeck song as you will ever find in a Hollywood musical.  One of the other things I like about &quot;Grease&quot; is that it retains its hard edge; there are a couple of cruel lines in here that you are not going to want to explain to younger kids (you will have enough trouble explaining how Sandra Dee is to them).  However, they do serve to anchor the movie a bit.  Not a deep musical and not particularly romantic per se, just one where a good time is had by all.<br />Most romantic line(s): (1) &quot;Oh Danny, is this the end?&quot; &quot;No Sandy. It's only the beginning.&quot;  (2) &quot;Tell me about it...stud.&quot;<br />Two Tear-Jerking Scenes: Um, there are several scenes with some jerks, does that count?<br />If you like &quot;Grease,&quot; then check out these other films on AFI's list: #12 &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot;  Why?  Because they are both based on Pygmalion and the transformation of a female from social outcast to paragon of social grace.  Oh, and they both have singing.both based on Pygmalion and the transformation of a female from social outcast to paragon of social grace.  Oh, and they both have singing.
0441003257|5.0|After reading everything I could find by Neil Gaiman, a bookseller suggested this book -- he said it was hilarious, and he was right!<br />What a joy to read!  This story was a delightful relief, an escape from the 6 o'clock news where the line between the good guys and the bad guys is presented as having a crisp black and white line (no matter what side you're on, &quot;They&quot; are 100% Evil, and &quot;We&quot; are 100% Good.)  In this story, the division is not that pristine.<br />Armageddon and the end of the human race is supposed to be underway on Saturday -- but everything's been a bit mixed up because eleven years ago, the Antichrist was accidentally switched at birth by one of the Sisters from the Chattering Order.<br />The young Lord to Be of the Underworld was supposed to have been named Warlock, and raised by an American ambassador. Instead, he's just a country boy, riding his bicycle with his three good friends and faithful hound (a downsized dog from you-know-where), living a rather wholesome life in the small village of Tadfield, with no properly evil training.<br />Long time arch rivals and good friends Crowley and Aziraphale will be in deep trouble with the Devil and God, their respective bosses, unless they find the missing child.  These two oddfellows have mixed feelings about the ending of the earthly world -- they've come to like the human race, and have found earthly things they will sorely miss -- things you can't get in Heaven or the Underworld!<br />So, get this book and go with them as they frantically search for the missing leader of the end of the world, while the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse approach on their Harleys.  Try to sort out the good guys from the bad guys. Newton Pulsifer, the scientific minded descendant of the main witchfinder who centuries ago burned the last real witch and prophetess Agnes Nutter is about to meet Anathema Device, Agnes's descendant, a young occultist. They are both moving toward Tadfield to destroy or support the only living person who can save the human race from absolute destruction.<br />Who will find whom, when, where and how?  And will good triumph over evil -- or is there a bit of good in even the nicest earthbound angel, and a touch of good in the most evil demon on earth?<br />An irreverent, witty, charmingly twisted view of that eternal battle between good and evil.  Now I'll have to start reading books by Terry Pratchett, too!or support the only living person who can save the human race from absolute destruction. <br />Who will find whom, when, where and how?  And will good triumph over evil -- or is there a bit of good in even the nicest earthbound angel, and a touch of good in the most evil demon on earth? <br />An irreverent, witty, charmingly twisted view of that eternal battle between good and evil.

0140177396|5.0|Last summer, this book was a required book for entering eigth grade English. It was short so I figured, \\"I'll just read this first and get it over with. I mean like, it seems kinda boring.\\" It just didn't seem to make much sense from what i read from the descriptions. When I read it, the first chapter was so relaxing and the setting was described so perfectly. Automatically, I was whisked away back to the 1930's in a quiet farming area in the rural areas of CA. I absolutely loved reading this book. It was such a good book! There were many themes that could be easily picked up. And from those themes, it helped explain certain attributes about different characters and the kind of society Lennie and George entered. In the end of the book, George makes a very large sacrifice that effects himself and a lot of the people he works with. It may also bring you to tears. It definitely brought me to tears. I don't think I saw it coming. I guess it was sort of... ironic. Enjoy your read!
B000000Y87|5.0|When you pop this CD into your CD player, if you close your eyes and listen very carefully to the opening strains of &quot;Gloria's Step,&quot; you can just barely imagine the scene on that June day in 1961 at the Village Vanguard in New York. Listen to the tinkling of the keys by Bill Evans' hands and float away on the wave of the music concocted by Evans, bassist Scott LaFaro, and drummer Paul Motian.<br />The six different songs on this CD (four of which are recorded twice) are so light and wonderful that they can be used in any situation--for listening on a rainy day, background music to a car ride, over a glass of lemonade, while cooking a meal...<br />My personal favorite, &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; starts with Evans playing the melody by himself at a free-form tempo. When he reaches the bridge, LaFaro and Motian join the fray, and change the tune into a beautiful jazz waltz that just flows. It is impossible not to be tapping your feet soon after this tune starts. <br />Evans' unbelievable piano solos and LaFaro's amazing bass solos are matched only by the fantastic brushwork of Paul Motian, providing a solid foundation to this wonderful and legendary trio. <br />This CD is worth listening to. Anytime. Kick back and be transported back to June 25, 1961--any time your heart desires.
014028009X|3.0|Yes, I liked the book.   I was expecting it to be really humorous, but it really wasn't a laugh out loud book.   It is a light read and one can get through it quickly.  I didn't dislike the book, but I was expecting more.  It is well worth reading and I found it entertaining.
0671799320|4.0|Yergin provides a highly readable acccount of how oil has driven so much of modern history. I especially found his chapters on World War II interesting; the degree to which a need for oil drove Hitler's war plans, as well as those of the Japanese and Americans. It's an aspect of the war that war historians don't pay much attention to but it's incredibly important. This approach provides insights into other areas of world affairs that make it worth struggling through the book's considerable length.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This album is so good, and so California that it almost makes me cry when I listen to it.  From start to finish the band weaves in and out of an array of diverse melodies that tickle your drums and pound your heart.  Californication gives me chills.
B00005OWEG|5.0|If you purchase this absolutely amazing motion picture, which I highly suggest that you do, I also highly suggest that you purchase Joeseph Conrad's book Heart of Darkness, upon which the movie is loosely based.  No matter what you thought of the first release, I guarentee that reading Heart of Darkness will significantly increase your enjoyment and understanding of this release.
6304779607|5.0|This has gotta be Sylvestor Stallone's best action movie in my opinion although some people are gonna say First Blood I&II. I read somewhere that this movie was a flop but I don't know why, it has some of the best action sequences I have ever seen. Standout scenes where he is on the back of a truck and mowing down bad guy bikers with his sub machine gun with laser siding.Another scene is where he throws a handgrenade at a biker and him and his bike get blown up into the air.The car chase in this movie is yet another great action scene as well as the beginning where a man walks into a shopping centre and starts blowing the place apart with his shotgun as well as killing a man for nothing.<BR>The story is a model witnesses a crime and sees the face of the killer and becomes the target of a serial killer. But he isn't on his own. He has a whole army behind him and she is the target. This army likes to kill people,\\"kill the weak so the strong can survive\\" so the leader of the army says. A police specialist is assigned to protect the woman and he is nicknamed The Cobra, real name Marion Cobretti.<BR>I love it at the end of the movie when the leader of the gang says the Cobra has gotta arrest him but Sly says, \\"This is where the law stops, and I start.\\"Classic line. The soundtrack to this film is great too, with \\"Feel the Heat\\" probably being the best song.Few stars are all that's available to rate this film but I would give it ten out of five if I could.
6304196784|4.0|Charles Chrichton's hiatus from the big screen had been interspersed with The Avengers after his direction of The Lavender Hill Mob.  John Cleese in fact sought out Chrichton in hopes of a collaboration for A Fish Called Wanda.  Starting out with only a rudimentary idea of the story, and Chrichton's request that he wanted \\"...to see someone steamrolled\\", the final result was a film that somehow struck a humorous chord all over the world.  The film just somehow \\"worked\\", and it's been a cherished classic ever sense.<br />Kevin Kline as the violent, idiotic, and egotistic Otto indirectly steals the film, but it is John Cleese who is the genius behind the scenes.  Utilizing the dry absurd whit perfected in Monty Python with co-star Michael Palin, the duo alongside sultry Jamie Lee Curtis evoke a dysfunctional yet harmonistic world of laughs, slaptstick, and that oh so familiar English congeniality that \\"bloody well works\\" in comedy.<br />For those longing for the complicit, balanced, and tight-fitting humor of the older English comedies, such as Alec Guinness in Our Man In Havana, and Alec again in Lavender Hill Mob, A Fish Called Wanda is a must-see.  If only Hollywood knew what it was missing too.
B000003N7G|5.0|A Love Supreme is one of those albums that I had always heard about as being one of Trane's quintessential pieces. <br />This work of art slowly brings the listener into Trane's universe through a simple, but sticky bass.  What follows is pure musical bliss with Trane weaving in and out of the rhythm section's perfect beats.  If you are attracted to spiritual, then this album is for you, and it also gives you a rare glimpse of Trane's singing voice, when he chants &quot;A Love Supreme, A Love Supreme....&quot;
B00005RY7X|5.0|Ok, I am no writer by any means but I just had to share how wonderful this album really is. It is just so full of electrifying songs such as Girls Own Love and Party til You Puke. Granted, a lot of his songs are about partying, it is just the type of music that makes you want to get up and keep pushing with your life instead of just sitting there. Not only that but each and every one of the songs are so catchy and easy to sing  along to. The melodies that Andrew has placed on this cd are so amazingly interweaved, you just find yourself singing constantly along with all the songs from one part of the song right into the next. It has been such a long time since a good fun rock cd such as this one has been done. This one cd just might guide rock music back to the way it used to be. In other words it is not only a cd full of party music but it is jam packed with great lyrics and sweet guitar riffs as well.
B000065U1N|3.0|This was another typical war movie. The dvd also was not a very pleasing experience. No Hawk trailer, only one featurette, not very pleasing.<BR>      Although Josh Hartnett stars, he has definitly recovered from Pearl Harbor. Black Hawk down is a well directed movie. Ridley Scott is fanominal in every aspect of the movie except charecter development. That is what downgrades this movie so horribly. Even though Josh Hartnett does a fine job keeping you attached to the screen, it still doesnt cover for the overlooked screenwrite. It is basicly 'Saving Private Ryan' without all of the emotional distress between the charecters. The movie almost makes you feel like you have randomly looked into the war. About one half hour of this film is not war. During this time, their was no plot involved with the charecters. The story revolved around Samolia. Now, Scott had the perfect oppertunity to make an unbelievable story where he covered the war in Samolia and he made the relations between the charecters intense. Not to give away any part of the movie but during the film, one of Hartnetts' men had been wounded and Hartnett had to help treat the wound. During this time, it got very emotional but the emotion would not stick with you due to the charecter loss. Their was no information prior to this incident and you know nothing about the two. <BR>       The editing in the film is fantastic and the sound is extremly well done. Hans Zimmer chose well in this film as does her in every film. I highly recommend seeing this movie just to see the inensity of the war because thats all the movie is. Literaly, its two hours of war then a half hour of mediocere attempts to salvage charecter knowledge. See the movie, dont buy the dvd.
B000062XGK|5.0|I've been waiting for years to see this version of The Abyss.  Yes this is the Director's Cut with the added footage that changes your whole perspective of the beings.  I wont give anything away to anyone who hasnt seen this, but it definitely makes you think differently of the beings seeing this version.<BR>Amazing what about 14 minutes of extra footage will do to a movie.<br />The DVD quality is excellent when played on a quality DVD player with quality wiring as all DVD's are.<br />I never view any of the special features on DVD's, I'm buying a movie, not the making of a movie.  I guess it would be nice though.<br />But I'm here rating what I saw in this DVD and it was very good.
0790733226|5.0|A message from outer space is received by a radio astronomer (Jodie Foster).  Once deciphered, it reveals the blueprints of how to build a mechanism that can transport one person.  The question now is who will go on this journey and where will this transport take them?  With unyielding confidence and intelligence, Contact takes an intriguing premise and develops it to near perfection, mixing equal parts character drama, suspense, romance, adventure, along with excellent special effects into a deft blend.  This is thought-provoking material delivered with a sure hand from Spielberg protege, Robert Zemeckis, who's become every bit as fine a director as his teacher was.  Great performances from Jodie Foster, William Fichtner, and David Morse (the latter two of which are the best character actors working today).
B00005YW4H|2.0|The first single, &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; is a very alluring tune. Its the reason I bought the album. However, the rest of the Cd gets boring and annoying after about three songs. Her voice is unique but the Cd holds no surprises. Every song sounds the same. Sorry Norah, I really wanted to love this CD.
0671024256|4.0|This book is a fun read.  The first part is autobiographical, with a focus on how he became the writer that he is.  I've read many of King's novels and short stories, but I was genuinely surprised and pleased at the way King can tell a tale in his own voice and from his own point of view.<br />The second part of the book is devoted to King's ruminations on the craft of writing.  He offers some great advice, but he is VERY regimented and inflexible on his view of how to write.  The insight is valuable enough, but it would have been nicer if he left a little room for other possible perspectives instead of setting down several almost random rules (watch TV less and read more, write in complete isolation with the door closed, don't write in public places) and declaring &quot;This is how you write!&quot;  On the other hand, I suppose that many who buy this book may want exactly that- a step-by-step, hand-holding procedure spelled out for them.<br />At any rate, I thoroughly enjoyed (re-)discovering King through this book.
B00001QGPS|4.0|Method Man and Redman fit so well together. Their personalities are almost identical and when they share the mic together their contrasting styles blend together perfectly.  This is a great album as many fans have been waiting for more of these two guys together, since they have teased us with some stellar guest appearances with each other over the years.  Songs like \\"Blackout\\", \\"Cereal Killer\\", \\"Run 4 Cover\\", and \\"The ?\\" are everything everyone could have expected and more.  I have almost no complaints about this album except for a few small things.  The song \\"4 Seasons\\" is straight amazing with LL Cool J killing his verse until a misplaced guest appearance of Ja Rule pops up.<br />And a \\"How High (remix)\\" appears on this album.  Although this song is great I wish they would've put the original on this album.  I'm sure no one would've minded one extra song on the album. If you like anything Red or Meth has done, cop this one right away as it won't disappoint.
B00005YW4H|4.0|An absolutely phenomenal voice!! The only thing that keeps me from giving this recording 5 stars is the production of the album. It's very raw, which I think is wonderfully appropriate, but her voice is very forward... to the point of throwing the album off balace slightly. Musically speaking however, she gets a very emphatic 5 stars. This album is just the beginning for this very talented young woman.
B00005M989|1.0|I gave this skimpy, pitifully assembled mess of a disc 1 star only because I really love Prince and have been a fan for more than 20 years. This is a poor representation of a musical genius and should truly be avoided by REAL Prince fans at all costs! This modern master deserves better!<br />A Pitiful excuse for a compilation.
B00005YW4H|5.0|After being introduced to her music, I just can't stop listening.  Her sound draws you in and holds your attention.  Some of her songs are sultry, thick, and erotic, and others are light, airy, and pensive.  No matter what sound you're looking for, you're sure to find something you just have to sing along with.
0812550706|5.0|Obviously, I am not the first person to read and love this book.  There's not much to say that has not already been said but I would like to add one more 5-star review to this masterpiece.  Card is a great writer and one of the voices that is forcing sci-fi to be taken seriously; this is his greatest work.  The sequel, &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, is also excellent (&quot;Ender's Game&quot; is a story of triumph at a terrible cost, and &quot;Speaker&quot; is about the subsequent atonement of the main character).  Later novels in the series lost focus, in my opinion, and the most recent ones (&quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;) are retellings of &quot;Ender's Game&quot; from a different perspective -- enjoyable, but not at the level of the original.  Even if you don't like science fiction, as long as you enjoy good writing you will like this book.
B000001GX8|4.0|I can't tell you how many times I've fast-forwarded my Shawshank to 1 hour 5 minutes into the tape just to hear this Duettino. And now I have my very own CD.  I've never played the full Figaro and I must admit, some of the pieces I have already heard and liked. But disc 2 track 28  is,  for me,  worth the entire cd set.<br />I am taping an entire side of tape of just this piece. Next time some boom-box kid pulls next to me and resonates the ground that my car sits on,  well, I'm gonna pump up the volume and show them what QUALITY music is all about -- all windows down, no foolin'.<br />Buy it and enjoy forever !!!!!!  CHJ
B00005JKG7|5.0|By far this is carpenter top notch stuff.This is the ultimate in ghost story telling with a musical score that's equally haunting.With-out a doubt my favorite horror film also one of my favorite movies in general.Ironicly enough \\" The Retun Of The Living Dead \\" (1) is also coming out the same day on DVD.That closes a big chapter in my most requested DVD must haves.Awsome.
B000021Y77|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. It was so hip and fast paced that there was never a dull moment. I think Franka Potente is an awesome actress and I hope to see some more of her work. Do check this film out - it's a can't miss Indie flick.
B00003CXI0|4.0|Appearently too many adults that reviewed the movie failed to remember that this is an adaptation of a childerns book, for those childern. Trying to compare this movie to &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot;, a movie made for adults from a book written for adults is childish and makes the reviewer peavish at best. Instead of complaining about the adaptation, be thankful the director made the movie for the childern who loved the book and did not attempt to convert it to something for adults which probly would end up not pleasing either the adults or the childern for whom it was written.
014028009X|5.0|What a fun book!  I rented the movie about five months ago and when I heard there was a book, I picked it up right away.  I'm actually glad I saw the movie first because the book was much better. (It usually is)  This is the kind of book you read when you're looking for something that is light and funny and can be finished off in an afternoon.  It's definately a 'girlie' book and I highly recommend it.
B000002LEE|5.0|This cd is so great, and so much better than ritual de lo habitual, which a lot of people say they like more than this. There's something about all the songs here, and the record itself, that makes is seem definitive, a powerhouse, an epic record that only comes along once a decade, I'd rank this in the top 5 greatest albums ever made, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Clube Band, Second Edition, Loveless, Spiderland, Nothing's Shocking. This record showed just how exciting and enticing &quot;alternative&quot; music was in 1988, back when &quot;alternative&quot; meant something. It's very imaginative, and dangerous sounding, you can really inhabit this cd, see through Perry Farrell's eyes for awhile, the music is rock, like nothing since Led Zeppelin's IV, it's really that album for the 80's, a late 80's version of Zoso. Jane Says is an incredible song, the centerpiece for the album, like stairway to heaven was for Zoso. If you like records that you can get really attatched to, that can take you into another world view for awhile, and change you, buy this record today, it's very solid, and will stand as Jane's masterpiece, and one of the truly great albums of the rock era. If you don't believe me, rolling stone has placed this in it's &quot;essential 200 albums of all time&quot;. Spin decided not to put ritual in it's top 90 of the nineties, saying something like &quot;we almost had a staff walkout over not including ritual de habitual in the list, too bad it nothing's shocking was released in 88&quot;. Perry Farrell is a generation X icon, and this album is a huge reason why, this is a sick album, like all great albums are, where you will feel sick to your stomach because the music is too penetrating, it'll change you forever hopefully as it has me, I wish I could put it into words, the absolute beauty of this record, it is EPIC.
B00005Y228|3.0|Great CD featuring many listenable tracks including the worldwide smash &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot;, the great ballad &quot;Your Love&quot; and the disco anthem &quot;Burning Up&quot;.  Not everything works, though.  &quot;Dancefloor&quot; is just boring while &quot;Come Into My World&quot; sounds too much like Donna Summer's &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot;.  It's too bad that the B-sides &quot;Tightrope&quot; and &quot;Never Spoken&quot; weren't included on this album...would've made it much better.  This US edition features two &quot;hidden&quot; gems...the dance smash &quot;Butterfly&quot; and the funky &quot;Boy&quot;.
B00003CXN4|4.0|TRAFFIC is a great film. It showcases from many angles the world of the drug user and trafficker. Director Steven Soderburgh uses a wonderful cast, many different camera types, and many intriguing subplots that all somehow link to make this film great. If you enjoy fine acting, great directors, views from many locations, and just great films in general, buy TRAFFIC today.<br />TRAFFIC bases around the installation of a new drug czar, superbly played by Michael Douglas. How can he fight a war on drugs when his daughter is a user? This is the question the character seems plagued by throughout the film. This makes for interesting discussion. Meanwhile, two Mexican police officers are swept into helping ward off cartels in Tijuana. Benecio Del Toro is excellent in the role. There are other plots which call for wonderful performances from the likes of Don Cheadle, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Albert Finney. All in all, this film is well scripted and acted.<br />TRAFFIC, like any film, has flaws. It is tedious at certain points, sometimes the language is too excessive, and it seems to offer a negative message to youth. However, for its few flaws, it is still a wonderfully crafted and shot film. It was lauded because of that fact. If you need a great film to watch, I urge you to buy TRAFFIC today!
B000065V1V|4.0|Bowie is one of the few guys out there who debuted in the 60s, has never taken \\"hiatus\\" since, and is still able to make albums that are solid and contemporary.  No \\"Bowie's Return!\\" tour for him, because he's still a musician that matters - not some drugged out hippie who's just been caught for tax evasion and needs to soak the fans for dough.  If I didn't know this CD was David Bowie, I'd think this was a new artist who's at the edge of today's music.  Look for cameos by Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) and Pete Townsend (The Who).  The CD is a great blend of dance beats and contemporary rock.  Highlights are the twisted longing of \\"Cactus\\" and the quiet sadness of \\"Everyone Says Hi.\\"
B00005QIPH|5.0|While it is a little absurd to call them &quot;the saviors of rock and roll&quot;, The Strokes are certainly a great band even this early on in their careers. I can confidently say that in my opinion they're the most promising rock band to come out of America in the last 15 years or so. Those people that say that they're overrated don't get it at all or haven't listened to them carefully enough. The Strokes are more original than any band out there today. Some people mention Television and The Stooges when discussing the Strokes - to me these people are missing what they're all about. They were more influenced by bands like The Velvet Underground and Bob Marley. But mentioning bands won't make you understand what they really sound like. You just have to get into their music to realize how good and original they really are and understand what they're trying to do. This is by far the best CD of the year and an incredible start for this young band.
B000065U1N|2.0|The saving grace of Black Hawk Down, is that real-world military people reportedly feel this movie represents war the way it really is, and shines a light of heroism on otherwise forgotten soldiers.<br />Real-world operators have my admiration and my respect. I hope this film helps bring pressure for better intel and better planning, so that our special forces' lives are not jeopardized by our side's ineptitude.<br />But from another standpoint, this movie is a flop. Black Hawk Down offers no context, no plot, no character development, no message. It makes everyone look interchangeable and therefore, disposable. It gives no perspective on the Somalis. It's not a movie, it's a DoD-approved simulation / reenactment, of an urban op gone bad. <br />The entire film is a pedantic exposition of light infantry tactics under fire. There's not even a view of how the mission should have been planned better. I can't recall one memorable scene from BHD, just a haze of confusion and explosions and gunfire and dodging from building to building. It was like a videogame.<br />The actors perform merely as one dimensional stand-ins for real military operators. That sort of quasi-documentary realism may appeal to young male viewers. But no individual personality emerges -- heck, the characters all look alike -- so there's a sheer lack of any emotional connection whatsoever with the audience. <br />Even the music, the blue hues, and the battle cinematography are recycled (from Gladiator).  Ridley Scott may be a terrific director, but war movies aren't his bag.
B00005QDW5|2.0|I'll cut to the chase-  what's wrong? Big hits not included!  No 'Dirty woman'.  Should have been a (reasonably priced) 3-CD collection, not jammed on 2 discs.  Which brings me to my second complaint - They bled the songs together, so one starts before the other is finished.  Case in point - No famous exhale at the end of The Wall - substituted by the first note of the next song. Last time I encountered this bleeding was Don Henley's CD Building the Perfect Beast.
B000068TPN|3.0|Based on a true story, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" recounts the first significant engagement between American and Vietnamese soldiers in 1965. In terms of realism and intensity, the battle scenes are truly state-of-the are and easily merit the same encomia as those in \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" From a human interest perspective, the film does a wonderful job of portraying the anguish of military families who must face the fear and reality of their loved ones dying in battle. And to the film maker's credit they make a significant effort to portray the Vietnamese enemy as good guys who were just doing their thing. <br />Oddly enough, the part of this movie I object to the most is the one that is frequently showcased in trailers and talk shows. In this scene, the protagonist, played by Mel Gibson, is asked by his daughter why people fight wars. He responds that war is what happens when bad men try to hurt other men and men like her daddy try to stop them. With these words, Mel Gibson not only provides his young daughter with an understandably innocent description of warfare in general, he also distills the entire theme of \\"We Were Soldiers\\" into a single sound byte. Mel Gibson is telling us that the Vietnamese were the bad guys and the Americans were the good guys who were trying to stop them.<br />These lines disturb me when I consider the context in which this film was made. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is following the newly blazed trail of neo-war movies that began with films like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". This film and the World War II films that followed reversed three decades of objective, analytical war films such as \\"Tora Tora Tora\\", \\"Apocalypse Now\\", \\"Platoon\\", and \\"Casualties of War\\" and instead replaced them with a sentimental, jingoistic view of American military action. This was acceptable enough with \\"World War II\\" because there really isn't too much trouble distinguishing between right and wrong in that event. With \\"We Were Soldiers\\", however, Hollywood hasnow attempted to reshape the public's understanding of the Vietnam War along similarly benign and simplistic guidelines. <br />At this point, many readers are probably thinking, \\"but this is a true story! How can you possibly state that it is misleading?\\" This is a perfectly valid question to which I would respond first that this film is based on a book which is itself misleading in many ways, and second, it is the EXCLUSION of facts that makes this film misleading. \\"We Were Soldiers\\" presents American troops as benign interventionists in a conflict they new little about. In doing this it excludes some ugly realities about what American presence in Vietnam meant for millions of Vietnamese. To begin, with the U.S. Congress estimates that in the course of the war the United States killed approximately 1,350,000 civilians, by all accounts a highly conservative estimate. In addition, there are numerous well documented instances crimes perpetrated by the American military against Vietnamese civilians including rape, murder, theft, unlawful imprisonment, the destruction of farmland, torture, contamination, and forced prostitution.<br />While \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is wonderful for all the reasons that an action packed, loosely historical film should be,  it is also problematic. If after seeing this film, you do not want to do some research in the library or online, at least see some films that offer different perspectives of the war. I know that for many of our veterans, unjustly blamed for something that was largely the fault of American politicians this film must seem like a welcome relief. Our veterans do deserve to be acknowledged, and its high time the nation apologized to them for the blame it heaped upon them for doing their duty. But distorting America's role in Vietnam by focusing exclusively on the heroics does not do them a favor. It does the entire country a great disservice.
0671582364|5.0|Hey,<br />I read the book THREE TIMES. It is AWESOME! Stephen King is the man and the bomb. His writing is so tight and right on. I had a feeling that Carrie was sort of true to life. Also, it was interesting to know that man so famous and probably filthy rich had such humble beginnings. Also, he isn't STUCK UP now either. Any beginning writer will appreciate the encouragement he gives to us. I hope to be as prolific as he is.
B00005K3NR|5.0|CARRIE, Brian DePalma's masterpiece of horror, gets its well-deserved treatment in this new Special Edition DVD containing several featurettes as well as trailers and text screens.<br />Young Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a loner.  She has no friends, and lives a life of fear and repression.  Her Bible-thumping momma (Piper Laurie) also chooses to reject and abuse her.  However, her pent-up anxiety causes her to get a form of telekineses, that lets her move things.  At first she is frightened of this all-new strength, but soon she realises that this could be the key to getting her long-overdue revenge on those who would torment her.<br />Sissy Spacek gives a heart-rending performance as the title character.  Piper Laurie is delicious as Carrie's fanatical mother (and is given all the best lines).  The fantastic supporting cast includes Amy Irving, Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles, John Travolta, Betty Buckley, Priscilla Pointer, William Katt and Edie McClurg.
B00003CWN2|3.0|This was a film that worked on my emotions like no other film has before. It's a devastating story about a woman with a sexual identity crisis, named Teena Brandon who dressed up like a guy, took hormone shots, and called herself Brandon Teena. She befriended two rednecks from a small town in Nebraska, and found herself a girlfriend named Lana. Once her true identity is discovered, the film takes you on an emotional roller coaster. <br />The performances here are perfect, especially those of Hillary Swank (who won her first Oscar for her performance in this film)and Chloe Sevingy (who was nominated for an Oscar). First time director, Kimberly Pierce, has made a film that will not be forgotten. My only complaint was the graphic sexual scenes. If they make you uncomfortable, then foward through them. That's what I did. Many may not be able to stomach this film because of the no-holds barred grittiness of it. It's heartbreaking, and I could not get it off of my mind. I suppose they had to make it violent and brutal, so they could accuratly portray the horrible things that happened to Teena Brandon and her friends.<br />Truly a sad story. See it if you think you can handle it. You won't be able to shake this one off for a while.
B0000073AD|4.0|I was vacationing in Athens, Greece a few years ago and the cafes I went to all played music. I kept hearing a particular song in all of the cafes- it was Everytime We Touch. That song sounded so cool, I asked the local DJ's who sings that song &amp; they said Maggie Reilley. I was on a hunt in the local music stores for that CD. Before that, I had never heard of Maggie Reilley, but now- her album is always in my CD player!! Some of the songs sound kinda like folk music, but the ones that don't are Very cool.
6305736650|2.0|popular big screen love story.  There is little chemistry between Bogart and Bergman characters.  The Germans just appeared to be too stupid in the movie.  If Bergman's so called on screen freedom fighter husband is so important, why don't the Germans just finish him off when they had the chance rather than just trying to keep him from getting to Lisbon, duh...  Ingrid Bergman is mesmerizing though, she deserves 5 stars.
B00000G3HZ|3.0|I rented the 15th anniversay edition of this movie when it caught my eye in the local video rental store. It was fun seeing all these actors and actresses when they were so much younger (almost 20 years ago) and in that sense the movie is sort of a nostalgic blast from the past kind of thing and had some interest for me just because of that.<br />Unfortunately, the years haven't been kind to it, because the film seems dated now, although in a way I couldn't quite nail down.  The basic idea seems like a good one--a group of friends who came of age in the more freewheeling, carefree, and chaotic 60's have lost a close friend through suicide and are brought together at his funeral. In the ensuing 20 years, they've all settled into more or less conventional careers and lives (except for William Hurt, who is a drug dealer). When Alex, who was perhaps the most talented of them all, inexplicably commits suicide, they are left asking themselves those difficult and disturbing, and perhaps ultimately unanswerable questions about life, love, and friendship.<br />The nostalgia aspect of the movie is enhanced by the soundtrack with all the oldie goldies from the 60's and 70's, which was fine, but although there is some occasional good acting here, most of the performances are unconvincing and seem curiously detached from each other and from the movie itself. I didn't even find their grief that convincing, which is what much of the movie is about. The first 45 minutes of the movie really drags, although things do pick up in the second half, and I'll grant that there are some much better and more convincing scenes there. The dialogue gets livelier and funnier, and there one or two very serious scenes where the group of friends tries to come to grips with the tragedy of their comrade's untimely and ultimately inscrutable demise--since he seems to have left no clues--not even a suicide note.<br />Anyway, it's not a bad movie, and as I said, I did enjoy seeing some of my favorite actors/actresses as they were 20 years ago, but overall, I was expecting much more given everything that I'd heard about it over the years.ctors/actresses as they were 20 years ago, but overall, I was expecting much more given everything that I'd heard about it over the years.

B00005YW4H|5.0|After a long day of work, I was flipping through the channels and caught Norah Jones' video for &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;.  After that, I was hooked!  Upon purchasing the CD, it has quickly become one of my all time favorites.<br />The entire CD is an outstanding blend of jazzy crazed piano mixed with outstanding vocals that touch your soul.  This is one of those CDs where you can just pop it into your player and not have to worry about skipping certain tracks.  If you need to entertain a trendy event, want to have a romantic evening, or even just relax in a bath with candles around you--then this CD is for you!<br />My favorite tracks are &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, &quot;I've got to See You Again&quot;, and &quot;Painter Song&quot;.<br />...Now, if this only came in minidisc....
B00005JKED|2.0|There are several movies that I don't understand how in the world people can dislike them.  Training Day falls into my second category of Why do so many people love this film.  Sure Denzel did a great job (I'm still not sure it deserved an Oscar Nomination...never mind the award).  Ethan was a tremendous supporting actor...but the movie was just a series of yelling matches.  What was the point of this film?  Why was Denzel's character the way he was?  There was just something totally missing here.
B00006690F|5.0|This CD is different than his others. Not so much of the music that makes your ears cringe... It has all new beats and sounds that make this one by far, his best.
B000065U1N|4.0|I guess I fall into that line of \\"liberal\\" who doesn't believe that the politics are as simple as \\"we tried to stop a famine.\\"  That's there, but reading the book the movie is taken from will inform the reader that the politics involved were far more shady than most would suspect.  The fact that the movie leaves that out doesn't seem to bother me.  I found it horrifying enough without the prerequisite politico preaching at me about the virtues of what we were or were not doing.<br />But, in a lot of ways it is difficult to make a war movie (especially now) that isn't chest thumping propaganda, but I have to say this is the best attempt I've seen in recent years.  But I have to emphasize \\"attempt\\".  I'm a war movie buff (how very contradictory for a someone who is \\"liberal\\") and the problems this movie has are the typical ones: sometimes the dialogue is rather bland and uneventful in the early going, and even though they are based on real life events and characters, sometimes its hard to buy either of these things, and I'm not talking about the combat scenes.  Actually, those become the most believable sequences in the movie.  But the film does manage to rise above those problems and become something that is thought provoking and absolutely horrifying (the scene where the Ranger is dying from blood loss is one of the most horrific things I've ever witnessed, and I'm sure it couldn't compare to what actually happened).  Added to the bit of dark humor woven into the story (the two machine gunners left on the street corner have their moments of levity) the movie makes you care about the Rangers and at least find a few of them interesting.  <br />However, the one major critcism the movie might suffer for is that it tends to turn the Somalis into a faceless horde with only a few representative archetypes that seem taken from a bad Rambo movie given much camera time.  Bowden's book attempted to move beyond that and I think Ridley Scott left that part behind.  In the humanity that Scott tries to convey on the part of the Rangers, the movie comes up lacking because the Somalis become a sea of clones hellbent on the destruction of the \\"evil Americans.\\"  For that reason, the movie might become patriotic fluff to some and it did display courage on a grand scale that wasn't the chest thumping of many war movies.  But the shear horror, terror, and absolute carnage displayed should turn stomachs, eyes, and a few second thoughts on the necessity of warfare and the courage it might often demand.  After all, here it became a matter of survival, politics be damned...
B000063S6Z|2.0|I wouldn't classify myself as an audiophile, but I can't listen to this without being annoyed by the cheesy-sounding instrumentation.  It sounds like someone in a music store playing with a mid-range synthesizer and a reverb unit.  And the \\"cello\\" on Great escape just makes me cringe.  I think electronic strings can work wonderfully when they're supporting a larger piece, but to have just a synth cello and voice sounds, well, [not so good].  It seems like Moby can appreciate the contrast between old grainy samples and crisp digital rhythms, and I wish he'd gone to a little more effort into using a similar contrast between analog instruments and synth.
B00005JKBC|1.0|Another forensically interesting example of Hollywood's view of the world.  Brad Pitt is an American-as-apple-pie CIA operative who unaccountably falls in love with a limey leftist terrorist whose only crime, apart from being not-so-loosely affiliated with Hezbollah, was bombing a Chinese embassy.  \\"It was supposed to be empty, but it wasn't.  And I have to live with that.\\"  Wait, let me get out my handkerchief: this babe's got it rough.  Apparently her murderous terrorism didn't clear her brain of her leftism any, because here she is collaborating with terrorists in Beirut.  But the whole thing of the movie is that she eventually is nabbed by the Chinese authorities - and rightly so - and is rotting in some Chinese prison - and rightly so.  However, the human rights groups may be having some effect on the place, because she, despite her confinement, is softly lit, seems to have some art up on the walls and is burning a copious supply of incense.  Anyway, Pitt gets wind of all this and he flips his wig, goes in there on his own recognizance to bust her out don't you know.  And naturally he gets busted - and rightly so - and so his old boss Redford commits massive fraud all over the CIA to commandeer a US spec ops strike team to bust the two of them out of the Chinese pokey.  In reality this would involve American and Chinese casualties incurred in the act of wrongly liberating these two dingbats and would lead to a probably very serious diplomatic problem between two nuclear powers but Hollywood prefers not to think about that.  The only world they're interested in is the pretend kind.
B000006E4C|5.0|This kind of music improves togheter with extraordanary sound. It shine MORE than ever because of that and Nonesuch has succeeded on that topic. It is a good piece in its &quot;original&quot; formula (ECM) but there is improvements on every composer more or less nowdays and this version give us a little more. Of corse sound is not enough but here you have a good mix of good sound and great -improved- music. I think this one is best because of reasons mentioned above (it is the so called original ensebmle playing this and I think they are better here than ever).
B00003CY0V|5.0|Oh yes. John Travolta sporting the \\"Pulp Fiction\\" hair and Hugh Jackman (that one guy from \\"X-Men\\") and Halle Berry all in one movie! Travolta's character is an anti-terrorist who hires a computer hacker (Jackman) to make some cheap money. $9.5 billion to be exact is to be transferred into the man's bank accounts or else. Halle Berry pulls Jackman to the operation and how can he refuse? She kicks major stern in this movie! He will do his job or people will perish and the bad guy will win. The monologue at the beginning with Travolta looking at the camera and asking his audience why didn't Al Pacino win in \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\". It's truly awesome. Plenty of 360* action and comedy for everyone to enjoy. Watch for a flying bus, yes, and people rolling down a steep hill. Although, the movie has no plot and cheap action, I'm sure any action fan will feast on it!
B00000I8DY|5.0|I dont have ANY Cosi fan tutte to compare with this but I am completly satisfied with this and even if we all have different taste etc I am sure that if you dont appriciate this disc you dont like Mozart operas, operas in general or music at all.<br />It is a little more \\"symphonic\\" than his others of the so called great ones (yes I have THE other so called great Mozart operas) AND it is extremly well played, conducted and... singing is def. over average.<br />You cant go wrong with this version and this is, what I think, the most under rated opera of Mozartz so called great ones (Die Zauberflute, Don Giovanni, Le nozze de Figaro) (I like them all -since I get this version).
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko isn't your average everyday teenager. Set in the early 90's, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; pays tribute to time travel and split personalities. He has a vision and his oddball family can't see it. A mysterious rabbit is in his dreams? Or does he actually see a rabbit talk to him? This movie will blow you away man. The originality deserves a lot of credit and the performances are brilliant. Drew Barrymore in a good movie? Yes. Finally, a movie that will make you think. The ending will leave you scratching your head. The supporting actors including Patrick Swayze! (yes) and Noah Wyle as a teacher are slimy, but fit just right. The main character played by Jake Gyllenhaal (the son on &quot;City Slickers&quot;) does a good job of playing a psychotic teenager and this movie sets its own standards as a 'teen picture'. Some advice: pay attention, don't touch your mirror and buy Patrick Swayze movies! Just kidding, kick back and relax and be nice to rabbits.
B000066JES|5.0|This latest album after a rest of some years is mana for the ears.<br />Turn that stero up to eleven and praise the heavens.<br />Truly brilliant.<br />Ok. Nessun Dorma and Dixie (in American Trilogy) might not be everyone's cup of tea, but lets wait for the next three tenors tour with support from Manowar.<br />However Warriors of the World United is just classic Manowar, raise that sword high!<br />Pity the nearest place to me on their latest tour is Denmark.<br />Manowar play ENGLAND!
B000059H98|1.0|The year is 2033. Who cares? It hasn't rained in over a decade and everybody is thirsty. Wow, then there would be nothing left of human civilization right? A company called Water and Power is controlled by Malcolm McDowell. It's up to a noisy woman who calls herself \\"Tank Girl\\" to stop the madman. Lori Petty plays the most annoying woman in the world and she needs to vanish. I wish I had the 'Clapper' to turn off the movie. Put that thing to good use. There were a lot of mutants running around in this piece of trash called the Rippers. Yeah, that's great. No! Who in the world would like this movie? It's insanely ugly! I thought I was going crazy after fifteen minutes had passed in this horrible mess.
B00006690F|4.0|I like this album overall. Sure, there aren't many Billboard- or MTV-bound hits on here like there were on his last albums, but that's the point. This is for his real fans, not those mainstream cats. So don't expect to see any song besides \\"Without Me\\" being played in the jukebox of your favorite bar. And \\"Without Me\\" is the worst song on here, but you know that Em always makes a goofy commercial track like that just to get mainstream appeal so folks can buy his album (remember \\"My Name Is\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\"?). Also, you know that you're not gonna like every single song on an Eminem album! Eminem himself doesn't even like every song he does. So just cop the album anyway.
B000059XUO|5.0|After Brandon Lee's tragic death, \\"The Crow\\" marks his best performance and will never be forgotten. As a happy, rock singer, Eric Draven (Lee) is murdered along with his girlfriend on Devil's Night. One year later, the man is brought back to life by a crow and vows to get revenge on the gang that killed he and his would-be wife. Venturing into the night, Draven puts on black clothing and puts paint on his face to resemble a mime. He puts his murderers through torture and ultimately gets revenge. Talk about justice. He uses all sorts of things as weapons! He can't die, he's invincible. Oh yes. A police officer with his own problems helps the immortal. Ernie Hudson plays the cop. He's cool. You also have a bad guy with long, brown hair who is also in love with his 'sister'. Twisted souls. He avenges his girlfriend's death and gains a friendship he once had with a little girl. She really needs a different haircut. Aside from the silly girl, the movie kicks major rear. Brandon Lee is a legend. This movie is the darkest comic book movie since \\"Batman\\" and it's extremely violent. Not for all tastes, but this movie packs a punch and will make anyone fire it up!

6305181772|4.0|This movie is so easy to understand, I explained it to a three-year old. C'mon, for real. Jim Phelps' attempt to retrieve a NOC list containing names is the easiest thing since making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Yes! Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is the leader of the pack, but the mission goes sourly wrong leaving him as the lone survivor. Even Phelps was taken care of. Or was he? Throughout the movie, Hunt tries to establish a new team and sell a copy of the list to a secret buyer. When he does that, the unidentified killer will remove his mask and make you realize that you've been dooped. C'mon, how simple is this movie? It's very self-explanatory. Emilio Estevez makes a cameo! Jon Voight is back! Remember the explosive bubblegum and never chew it! The computer room scene is insane and the train is sick! There are plenty of twists and turns, so you better pay attention. I left the room for about twenty minutes and I still followed the movie. It is indeed, quite possible to understand.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Just as the Rolling Stones in the 60's always had something to prove to the Beatles, The Clash were seen to be snapping at the heels of the Sex Pistols and were obliged in the early part of their career to pull off something exceptional time after time. And that's just what they did, more or less defining punks agenda in broadening 70's angst into the world of mainstream and revolutionary politics.<br /><br />Busting at the seams with creative energy, The Clash's stunning 1979 double album \\"London Calling\\", digitally remastered from the original production tapes, puts both vinyl albums on one C.D. This reissue of the band's 3rd album features all the original artwork and all nineteen of the original tracks including the hidden hit single \\"Train In Vain (stand by me)\\", their first U.S. single to chart (it reached No. 23 on the Billboard at the time).<br /><br />\\"London Calling\\" more than made up for the artistic and commercial disappointment of its predecessor, 1978's tried-too-hard heavy metal bluster of \\"Give'Em Enough Rope\\". With ex-Mott the Hoople producer Guy Stevens harnessing their sound like no one had ever done before giving them that vital fresh in your face sound, that gave them the music of the days youth, which still sounds alive now.

B00003CXRM|5.0|Homer's &quot;Odessy&quot; set in the Great Depression of the 1930s.  The unexpected slap stick humor of the opening sceens sets the entire movie off on a possitive note.  I've purchased the movie AND the soundtrack.  Both are excellent!!  I'm very impressed with the use of &quot;surround sound&quot; in the movie.  I feel its use is very effective in the &quot;baptism at the river&quot; scene.<br />The accent of all the characters fits perfectly in the Delta Area of the state of Mississippi.<br />I would recommend purchasing this movie and its soundtrack.  A definate excellent addition to anyone's library.<br />Although, after reading a representative portion of the reviews, maybe this movie is not for everyone.  If you can appreciate &quot;rural&quot; humor of the deep South, I'd strongly recommend it.  Not everyone likes Andy Griffith!  :)
B00005QIPH|5.0|This album is great. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Anybody who did not give it five stars obviously does not have ears. <BR>So then, why is it so good? Well, there are two main reasons. First, there are four layers over which the music is evenly distributed: the two guitars (which DO play different things), the bass, and the vocals. Each part equally contributes to the greatness of every song on the album. Second, the melodic interplay is amazing. By this, I mean the way in which the four melodic parts interact. You have to listen carefully to appreciate this, but believe me, it's there.<BR>A common criticism of The Strokes is they are amateurs. They are not amateurs; that is an ignorant statement. And if they were, that does not change the great sounds they are creating. Frankly, if five guys repeatedly fell on two guitars, a bass, some drums, and yelled tunefully in such a manner as to produce one of the songs from the album, it would still be good. Folks, great sound is great sound.<BR>Another criticism is that they are derivative. Well, first of all they are not derivative. The only indie band they have even heard is the Velvet Underground. Perhaps they have stolen the notion of making musical notes by means of musical instruments, but nothing more. And even if they were derivative, I pose this question: so? Had they copied something, it was obviously the greatest thing ever. <BR>Finally, people who don't like this album purely because of the hype it received are worthless morons striving to differ from the norm. The Strokes already differ from the norm in that they are good.<BR>Buy this album. If anyone else tells you otherwise, don't listen to them. Preferably, punch them in the nose, but at the very least, don't listen to them.
0380788624|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, and can recommend it.  My only caveat is what other reviewers have mentioned--it's just overstuffed.  I was riveted right up until the last few chapters, when he started ANOTHER tangent--this time about diving technology and I got the bends.  <br />    Still, the guy is smarter and more knowledgeable than the next five authors put together.  Real fun.
B000002H97|1.0|This album is a textbook example of how to sell out.  Metallica severely compromises their previous artistic vision and speed metal chops to cash in with some mainstream metal.  This particular kind of metal is unoriginal and sometimes plodding and boring.  I heard James Hetfield say in an interview that they just couldn't play like they used to.  Well, I'd say it's time to either start an entirely new group or just hang it up.
B000065U1N|4.0|But... but...<br />Here's your 30-second review.  <br />a) If you read the book, you won't be disappointed.  I was astounded (upon seeing it in the theatre) at how many of the scenes looked exactly as I had imagined them after reading the book.  The aerial cinematorgraphy is breathtaking, and the scene where they first take off and head into the city--set to \\"Voodoo Chile\\" by Stevie Ray Vaughan (his version), is just AWESOME.<br />b) Having said that, it plays out like the book.  Non-stop, gut-wrenching carnage.  This is not a relaxing film to watch; you end up getting more and more wound up as it continues because you want it to stop.  But that's the point.<br />c) And the point is: never has a movie portrayed so realistically the horror of modern, urban warfare--this is no \\"Desert Storm,\\" where we just roll over hapless foes with our technology; this is street-to-street, brutal conflict.  After seeing the movie, you're amazed that we only lost 19.<br />d) Downsides?  The opening scenes (to \\"introduce\\" us to characters) and the closing (unnecessarily maudlin) smack of Jerry Bruckheimer Top-Gun-itis.  They're silly and Hollywood.  But they're not enough to not recommend this movie (yes I own it).<br />e) Finally, the standout performance is by the Australian (!!) actor playing the Delta Force guy.  Awesome.  He's a southerner in the movie, but if you watch the \\"Making of\\" section, he sounds like Crocodile Dundee.  Nice job.<br />f) The extras are minimal: no director or actor commentaries, deleted scenes or alternate endings.  You're basically getting the film, a \\"Making of\\" special, the trailers, and that's it.
0811826848|5.0|Wonderful, epic book on the Fab Four.  Great photos bring John, Paul, Ringo, George back to life.  Combined with Alan Arlt's fictional masterpiece on the Beatles, THE CARPET FROGS, this book makes my Beatles collection complete.
0452282152|5.0|Instantly, Girl With A Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier draws its readers into an unfamiliar yet excitingly new setting in 1700th century Holland, where a sixteen-year-old timid girl sets the stage. Griet detests the idea of having to serve the family of rich painter Johannes Vermeer. Soon enough, though, Griet is faced with many inspirational experiences that she can no longer pretend do not intrigue her. This novel is the struggle between artist Vermeer and Griet and his desire to teach her how to be a more appreciative person who can see the true beauty of life and understand what love really is. <br />I suggest that everyone seriusoly takes time out to read this novel. It captures life and beauty in its true essance and brought me to tears when I finished. I cannot ever remember being as moved and inspired as I was with this story...
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is by far the best group I have listened to in ages. I wasn't very interested in modern/alternative rock until my friend introduced me to two groups: Puddle of Mudd and Linkin Park. The first LP song I ever heard was &quot;Crawling&quot; and soon I was searching for the group and song title. As a congratulatory gift, my mom bought me this CD, which she has dubbed &quot;The Screaming Guys&quot; because of Chester's AMAZING vocals. He and Mike pack so much emotion into their songs it is impossible to ignore them. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD! Go buy it for you, or your kids.
B00005YW4H|1.0|&quot;Come Away with Me&quot; was a big disappointment. All the songs sound the same; there is no change in rhythm, tempo, voice range or piano composition. One song seems suspiciously similar to one by Leonard Cohen, with just a few of the words changed. I hope I can sell this CD. Although Norah is a sultry beauty, her talents in voice and piano leave much to be desired.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|When one listens to the entire album, one finds that yes, there is less than great material in spots.  For example, while a lot of people like it, I find &quot;So Long Frank Lloyd Wright&quot; a snoozer.  And some, like &quot;Why Don't You Write Me&quot; I just pass over with the CD button.  But when this album shines, it shines big time.<br />First of all, the title track may be my favorite song of all time.  Art Garfunkel is touring these days, and when I saw him last year, it was magical to see the song (and a whole bunch of others) performed live.  The piano composition, Simon's songwriting, and Garfunkel's stirring voice make it impossible for me to not to sing along every time I hear it.  When I pop the CD in, the song usually gets played several times over each of the other songs.<br />But there is more magnificence here.  &quot;The Boxer&quot;, though a single released earlier, for which I am grateful that they included in the album, is almost as good as the title track.  Here we get to see what Simon sounds like back in those days.  This song of lonliness should be followed by the title track, as &quot;The Boxer&quot; really needs the friendship offered in &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;.<br />If you can see Garfunkel live, the drum solo done with &quot;Cecilia&quot; is the best I've ever heard.  While this is the cathiest song on the album, the drummer takes the rat-a-tat work from the song, and turns it into a major reggae production.  <br />The other song I put in the &quot;must have&quot; category, that didn't get the big airplay is &quot;Keep the Customer Satisfied&quot;.  If the pop band Chicago had played more horns like this, I would have liked them more.  <br />This album is thirty years old.  I've listened closely to several thousand albums in my life, which means tens of thousands of songs.  Put a gun to my head and demand my favorite.  After all these years, the reply would probably be &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;.
B000021YQV|5.0|One word describes this album very well:<br />EXCELLENCE.<br />All of the songs are good on the CD, but the following are my top tracks on the album:<br />- Prison song<BR>- X<BR>- Forest<BR>- ATWR<BR>- Psycho<BR>- Aerials<br />Just buy the album -- you won't be disappointed (unless you didn't like Chop Suey! or Toxicity either).
B00005JKEC|4.0|Have you every done something that you normally didn't want to do just because someone else wants you to do it?  If you are in love, that's great, but often it's just because someone is at least a bit intimidating.  Or very intimidating.  You find that avoiding an arguement with the person is more important than your lack of desire for doing the task.  Unless you are a total bully, we've all experienced this.  <br />\\"Training Day\\" takes this to the extreme.  Ethan Hawke is on his first day with a special police unit that he wants very much to be a member of.  He very much wants to impress Denzel Washington, the leader of the group, but encounters problems from his first minute with Washington, and they only get worse from there.  It is the nightmare that unfolds that makes this well worth seeing.  <br />Cops are not choir boys, and the terrific new series \\"The Shield\\" points this out to the extreme.  When undercover cops work with trash, some of it is bound to rub off.  And I'm sure most of us would say there would be no way we would smoke a joint laced with PCP offered from the boss, especially on the first day on the job.  But where the movie succeeds in how the Oscar-winning intimidation by Denzel Washington makes it perfectly believeable that this could happen.  <br />Once that dirty deed is done, Hawke becomes almost putty in Washington's hands, and is taken from one harrowing situation to another.  You want to believe that some good will come of it.  After all, cops need to learn how things are done to effectively get their jobs done, and this sometimes means acting less than angellic.  You want to believe that Washington overall ends justify his means.  To see if this comes to pass, catch this movie, which is not for the faint of heart.
0679731725|5.0|I like Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins as much as anyone, but the book is far more satisfying than the movie.  For one, given the impressionist technique used to advance the narrative, learning the truth about Lord Darlington is a far more satisfying experience when reading the book than seeing the movie.  It is only then that the reader is alert to the fact that everything he had been told is warped by the hero's perspective-he cannot admit to us or himself that he has given his life to an unjust cause. Rather than spoil anything else, I will leave it at that.  Read the book, before seeing the movie, you will not be sorry.
0679777547|5.0|Another gripping novel by Reverte.  I love all his books, except his latest one, and my favorite is &quot;Flander's Panel&quot;.  I am also a fan of Dumas, so it made this novel doubly interesting.  Reverte is an amazing writer and weaves a thrilling plot.  Highly recommended reading for anyone intrested in a good thriller!
B00005ATZT|5.0|Wow, this movie is just great.  It is filled with action and is smart.  Its a story about a man who has been wrongfully accused of murdering his wife.  He is hunted through the city, woods, hospitals, throughout the movie.  The marshall that is after him will stop at nothing to find him.  Dr. Kimble though must find a way to prove that he is innocent, and find the real killer.  This is just 2 hours of non stop excitement.<br />The sequel &quot;Us Marshalls&quot; is not even half as good.  I wouldn't recommend it.<br />Also the movie &quot;Wrongfully Accused&quot;, which is a parody of this movie and a couple of others, was not that good, it had some good laughs but overall it wasn't worth it.
0553577123|5.0|The horror of this book comes through from Anne's day to day life, it is so much like anyone else's except of course that she is Jewish and in hiding.  Her feelings, thoughts, encounters, and dreams establish her humanity and connect with the reader across time.  All of this from a girl living under the constant fear of being found and exterminated.  The Holocaust is sometimes unimaginable because it was so massive, this book puts the tragedy on a personal level, introduces you to a young girl who will end her life in a Concentration Camp.<br />It is unfortunate that Anne couldn't have written while in the camp system and that those writings could have been found. It would have allowed the horror to be felt through familiar eyes. A personal introduction to the insanity that was Nazi Germany. One personal story to represent the millions left untold.<br />As the father of two daughters, I can not imagine how Otto Frank continued to live after the war, he lost everything. Anne's words are intimate and personable. Proof that a bright future was crushed, used up and dumped into a mass grave.
0792839692|1.0|This movie is racist stuff. It looks more like a Ku Klux Klan's dream of the perfect future. Logan's Run shows us only white people.<br />No Asians. No blacks. No hispanics.<br />Why don't they at least include a colored person?Logan's Run is made in seventies where black and Asiain actors will begin to be common in hollywood.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Complete disappointment! Did not live up to the hype or praise. All these reviewers interpretating the meaning of this annoying piece are only accomplishing one thing: killing unnecessary brain cells. David Lynch's style of direction is mediocre at best and I feel I am being very generous. He accomplished one thing though: CONFUSION. Viewers who claim they perfectly understand this movie are kidding themselves. The movie is intentionally not meant to be understood. Each person that watches this garbage develops his or her own believing of what message this movie is conveying. Sadly, you are probably all wrong and David Lynch is secretly laughing at the audience. I believe he himself could not explain to you what is really going on, but that is what he wants. David Lynch has got a cult of viewers who are brainwashed into his heap.  The acting was not very convincing and the movie did not grip me at all. I never felt mystery or anxiousness of trying to figure it out. I had a hard enough time avoid looking at my watch. The premise of a dream or fantasy as a plot could be very interesting but Lynch fails to execute. As I was watching, I could not help to wonder; what is the big deal? I found most of the scenes to be quite boring along with the numb characters. I did not feel the controversy. This movie is very, very, very, overrated!! To anyone who has not seen it, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. Believe all the hype and you most certainly will finish this film and feel betrayed.
B00006690G|4.0|This is the first Eminem CD I have bought/listened to and I am so glad I did. I'm more of a pop girl (I personally find his little digs at Nysnc to be absolutely hysterical as they are my fav. boy band) but this CD blows me away. I can't give a full review as I have only gotten to song 12 on it no matter how many times I listen to it, its guaranteed someone will stop me as song 13 comes on. Its become a running joke with me, actually. But I can tell you that tracks 1-12 are simply amazing. <br />White America is wonderful. I think he hits the nail right on the head with his lyrics. The second track is by far my favorite in terms of whimsical openings; the Batman/Robin skit makes me laugh every time I hear it and that's impressive considering how often I've listened to this CD on my eternal quest to get past song 12. Cleaning Out My Closet is so poignant it almost makes me cry. The absolute confusion that comes across is outstanding. Even the pistol whipping skit is amusing in its our exaggerated way. I love song 5 and of course Without Me is why I bought it. The only track I don't much care for is song 9. There's just something about it.<br />I'm skipping some tracks but other reviewers have gone into much greater detail so you should get the picture easily regardless of whether I go through them or not.<br />I think this CD is truly one of the best I have ever bought. I don't know much about Eminem but this CD makes me want to go out and buy his other ones.
B00005IC2H|4.0|I think that some of the negative (and positive) reviews get a little hung up on relatively recent bands. That is, there's a tendency to name-drop or compare to the latest/greatest/hippest and to search for antecedents (but only in the last 12 months).<br />Here's my take: Sigur Ros steps into a tradition that includes Godspeed Black Emperor, but really refers back through Elizabeth Frazier's projects and back through Tim Buckley's work, landing squarely with Sgt. Pepper and Love's &quot;Forever Changes.&quot; The latter, coupled with Spirit's &quot;12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus,&quot; represent much more useful referrants for Ros fans. Throw in the scope of Van Morrison's &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; as well, and (on at least three of the songs), dream-perfect playing ala Pink Floyd on &quot;Meddle&quot; or &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot; Perhaps there's even a nod to King Crimson's first album. But I think that the sensibility of Sigur Ros is linked most strongly to the very few bands of the psychedelic era that could actually write a hook.<br />I don't give 5 stars unless an album is uniformly perfect--unless I can't pick out a lesser track--but the ambition and execution in several of these tracks is astonishing. &quot;Avalon&quot; is, IMO, right up there with &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; which is--as one critic noted--right up there with Schubert's best work. If Sigur Ros ever accomplishes (on every track) that which they seek to do, they'll have a top-10 (of all time) album.
6300216802|4.0|Hey all you Star Trek Fans!  I loved this movie and I'm not really even I star Trek fan really.  It was well thought out, and the characters were very believeable.  I only rented it because I like Stephen Collins and I rent every movie he's in in fact, I rent every movie that every cast member of 7th Heaven has been in.  In this movie in case you don't know him, he played Captain/Comander Willard.  Great Guy!  Also, I took away one star because the picture quality was crummy.
B00005QIPH|5.0|It's hard to say that an album is overhyped it it fully lives up to expectations.  The voive of Julian Casablanca is perfect for ths sound of the future of Rock 'n Roll.  The Strokes also have what is probably the best use of two guitars since Oasis.  Overall this is one album that will be listened to for years to come.
B00005QXXO|5.0|The greatest thing about I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings is the energy.  Radiohead has been hailed as the best current live rock band, and while I'm not going that far, I agree that the band is simply amazing live.  I know all of the albums except Pablo Honey quite well, and this cd still brought me to a greater level of understanding for the life in the music.  The energy in the studio albums is there but often hidden behind electronic melancholy and as a result overlooked by listeners.  After listening to I Might Be Wrong, however, it is impossible to deny the vigor and pent-up emotions of the band.  When absorbing I Might Be Wrong, one can hear Thom's trademark wobbling/thrashing and feel the climaxes of the songs as if one was either in the front row or else writing the songs themselves.  <br />The material comes from Kid A and Amnesiac, excepting the last track 'True Love Waits'.  The highlight track, 'Like Spinning Plates' begins with a lovely piano intro radically different from the other songs' asperous vivacity but including the same pithy emotion.  <br />Of course no CD can compare to or completely replicate the live experience, but I Might Be Wrong is worthwhile in its own way.  If you buy it, buy it because you love Radiohead and want to feel what goes on in their very hearts.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I own the Harry Potter DVD  and I have to tell you it's awesome. I'm 35, love the books, and even love the movie. It's a fun wild ride that you ought to check out.
B000000Y2R|5.0|On a shopping spree, I bought this one, speak no evil and maiden voyage. Well, after listening to all three, this one just stay in my cd player. Some of the best music ever recorded in any kind of music. Beware: it was recorded by Mingus on a portable equipment. The sound quality is not for this age of 2000 bit digitally remastered. Sometimes the players are recorded at differnet volumes throughout the album. But dont let that prevent you from listening to this amazing, work of art. If No Parker, no Miles, no Coltrane, no Mingus, etc.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I got to tell you, this movie is funny. You'll absolutely love this one. I loved the first two movies from Pixar(Toy Story and Toy Story 2)so, when I heard they were coming out with yet another, I had to check it out and I'm glad that I did. John Goodman and Billy Crystal head off the cast in this movie and they do a stellar job. When a lil girl named Boo gets lost in the closet monster's world, it's up to them to help her find her way back. Boy, do they ever. It's one wild ride that the whole family will love to watch.<br />I highly recommend this one to the young and old alike. It's fantastic.
0064471837|5.0|This was one of my favorote books i have ever read.<br />(and that is sayin somthing cause i am hard to please when it comes to books) It is very well writen. It is so imaginative and the characters seem so real. It's basicly a classic fight against good and evil with a twist and a hint of romance. I highly recomend it you won't be able to put it down!!
B00000FCBC|5.0|Imagine, if you will, the greatest band on Earth digging through their greatest moments of musical strength and agility. Imagine then that the greatest band combines all of these fantastic songs into one unbelieveable compilation.<br />That is what Garage, Inc. is.<br />This album is BY FAR the GREATEST collection of songs Metallica has ever put together. In my opinion, this album is at least TWICE as GOOD as ANY OTHER Metallica album EVER! Combine them all and you might rival this masterpiece, because Garage, Inc. includes the Metallica originals from their Garage Days with rare moments of fury that make \\"Enter Sandman\\" look simple and soft. Songs like \\"AM I EVIL?\\" and \\"STONE DEAD FOREVER\\" are awesome. Sure, those are on the SECOND DISC but on the FIRST one are ELEVEN new EPIC SONGS that leave me purring and just keep pounding at you.<br />Garage, Inc. is both a new album as well as BONUS B-sides with many previously Un-released hits that EVERY FAN MUST HAVE! If you do not yet have this album and you LOVE metal, then you must get this METALLICA NOW!
B000022TSW|4.0|\\"South Park\\" is now a movie and the results are hillarious.  This is a really funny film that takes satire to the limit.  Is the film outrageous?  Yes.  Offensive?  Yes.  Vulgar?  Yes.  But, it's SUPPOSED TO BE!!!  It's \\"South Park\\" for crying out loud!<br />...<br />Now, back to the review.  Here is the story: Eric, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny sneek into a rated R movie which has every vulgarity every said by man.  The kids start to swear and the parents are outraged.  Now the parents declare war on Canada.  It's up to the boys to prevent a war that can destroy the world.<br />This movie is very funny.  There is singing, but the songs are funny and vulgar.  This is South Park humor at its almost best.  Still, I found myself enjoying the shows just a little more than the movie.  But don't get me wrong, I really did like the movie.<br />I wished there were more special features on the DVD.  It looks and sound spectacular, but it lacks in special features.  There's two trailers and a teaser for the film, and that's about it.  This would've been the perfect movie to have a few Easter Eggs lurking about.  Oh well.<br />This is a great film, and if you love the show, chances are you will enjoy this movie.  ... All in all, very good movie indeed.  As Eric Cartman would say, \\"Sweet!\\"
0553712985|5.0|This is soooooo good.  Every page is good.  I can almost say every word is good.  I haven't enjoyed a read so much in a very long time.  You WILL NOT want it to end!  It isn't just the plot twists or the fascinating characters.  Squares became my best friend.  I do have a question regarding the Epilogue.  I'm sorry, but who is Cray Spring?  Please another soon Mr. Coben.
B000066NW0|3.0|The onslaught of guitar girls has begun, with Michelle Branch, M2M, and others, it seems the record companies have either started taking a listen to young singer-songwriters or have just found a pretty face and gave her a guitar to play around with.  Avril Lavigne is the latest.  First off, Avril is a talented girl, she can punch out a few decent riffs, and can wrap her voice around a variety of vocal melodies, and she has a distinct personality.  But her lyrics are extremely awkward, for example in &quot;Complicated&quot; she spouts off her little gem, &quot;Take off all your preppy clothes&quot; it's nice to know she cares.  And her obsession with her own self-professed skater punkish leanings grow a little tiresome too, I got the point the first time and I don't need it driven into my skull a hundred times.  I don't have a problem with her musically I guess, shes solid there, but I can't get round her mediocre lyrics and awkward rhyme scheme that just sounds like 8th grade poetry more than anything else.  But this isn't staggeringly bad or anything embarassing, so if she at least stop leaning on her image and just write some good lyrics, she'll be set.  But what do I know.
0062502182|4.0|the alchemist is the second book that i have read by paulo coelho and i can only describe the book using a favorite phrase that i saw on the net - a moment of clarity in a world of grey. This book is the best so far. This book depicts a sense of awareness for individuals and the people around them. Its a story with an underlying theme that our actions, wether provoked or not can actually be consequential in other people's lives. A very good point that was mentioned in the book that we probably take for granted was the part when the crystal merchant said that there are some poeple who follow their dreams because it is their reason for living, its the destiny that they see for themselves and there are some poeple who are content with just dreaming because once they've accomplished a certain dream they have no more reason for living.  The contents of this book especially on the part about following one's dreams can only be grasped figuratively and it is up to us whether we can believe that what happended to Santiago can happen to us. I described this book as a moment of clarity in a world of grey because in some ways it opened up for me a view on how to follow ones destiny and for all those who are planning to read this book, all i can say is that this book will help you dream a little more, hope a little more and appreciate a little more inspite of all the shortcomings that the world has shown.
0800141806|4.0|Philadelphia deals with an AIDS-stricken homosexual attorney, played by Tom Hanks, who brings a wrongful-dismissal suit against the firm that fired him.  It's a wonderfully sympathetic tale that did wonders in increasing understanding of people suffering from AIDS in the early 90s, and a magnificent display of acting by Hanks and Denzel Washington.  The film shows just how easy it is for society to dismiss someone at a time of greatest need, and how wrong it is to do that.  The film, along with Bruce Springsteen's title song, has aged well in the intervening years and remains relevant today.
B00005OM5L|5.0|This is Eric Clapton at his best. EC has not played with this much fire and intensity since the 70's, including his Derek And The Domino's days. His guitar playing is absolutely FEROCIOUS...which probably shouldn't come as a big surprise, as this concert took place during his 'Back To The Cradle' period, his most convincing and inspired studio album in ages.<br />The sound quality on this DVD is superb. As it should be, because the incredible TONES Clapton coaxes out of his guitar and amp are that which most guitar players would kill for.<br />The image quality is also outstanding, very clear and sharp. The camera work is great, with LOTS of closeups of EC and his guitar during the solos, which is an added treat for guitar junkies (myself included.)<br />For my money, this is the BEST Eric Clapton concert film available. If you're an Eric Clapton fan, this DVD is the one to get.<br />(NOTE: The DVD edition contains two songs not included on the VHS version: smoldering renditions of \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" and \\"It Hurts Me Too\\".)<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />Jun 14,2002...
B00003CWRX|5.0|\\"The Insider\\" is a riveting, gut-wrenching experience, which was largely ignored at the box office and got shafted in the Oscar race. Both of these occurrences are shameful because the public and the Academy failed to recognize one of the best of movies of the year (if not the best; I thought \\"American Beauty\\" was overrated), and probably one of the best movies of the 1990s.<br />The most shocking aspect of \\"The Insider\\" is that it is all true. Everything portrayed on the screen actually happened (though enhanced for dramatic effect, of course). There is a man named Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe), a former researcher at the Brown & Williamson (B&W) tobacco company. Upon being fired for \\"creative differences,\\" he tapes an interview with \\"60 Minutes\\" in which he states that Big Tobacco executives (lovingly referred to as the \\"Seven Dwarfs\\") lied to Congress when they testified that the nicotine in cigarettes does not cause cancer. Wigand's confession violates his confidentiality agreement with B&W; his severance package (including health benefits for his asthmatic daughter) is terminated, and he and his family are threatened. He risks everything to expose one of the most egregious social injustices of our time--and CBS was not going to even air his interview for fear of being sued by B&W. As you are watching, ask yourself, \\"If you were in Wigand's position, would you do it?\\" Then you will see what courageous and driven man he must be.<br />All of these feelings and emotions come out in Russell Crowe's power-packed, dynamite performance. He completely loses himself in Wigand's personality, and gives a heartfelt portrayal of a man trying to do good, but pushed back and tormented every step of the way. Crowe brings you along with him into Wigand's world, takes you into his personal hell, and eventually leads you out. Dramatic performances don't get better than this.<br />Equally powerful is Al Pacino as a \\"60 Minutes\\" producer who fights to get Wigand's interview on the air. He is equally passionate about journalistic integrity and moral obligation, and steps into the ring with CBS execs to ensure that the truth is heard. He will not rest until the job is done, and will not accept no for an answer. He is believable, likeable and righteous; the scenes where he tries to earn Wigand's trust are awesome (he and Crow have good chemistry). This is Pacino's best turn in years.<br />Kudos also to Christopher Plummer as \\"60 Minutes\\" anchor Mike Wallace, and to director Michael Mann for his gritty, no-nonsense filming.<br />\\"The Insider\\" was nominated for 7 Oscars (including Best Picture, Best Director for Mann, and Best Actor for Crowe), and did not win a single one. I would have nominated Pacino for Best Actor, and Plummer for Supporting Actor, and would have actually handed out a few. The performances of each, especially Crowe, are worthy of Oscars. \\"The Insider\\" is a long film, but well worth it. It is a movie everyone should see; it will change how you view the world.
0440219078|4.0|Choices. Change. Love. Pain. Sensuality, growing up, becoming an individual, being DIFFERENT. Lies, overprotection, and even murder.  Now tell me, how could such a book not be completely enjoyed?! The first time I read it, a couple years ago, I didn't comprehend the REAL meaning of this book...(or should I say several meanings?) To put it simply, I just didn't get it--especially the ending.  At first I thought it was completely stupid..I mean, THERE IS NO REAL ENDING! How in the world are we supposed to enjoy that, Lois Lowry!?<br />     Hahaha.. what was I thinking? Now I take that all back.  Upon reading this book again and actually analyzing it in my Language Arts class, I got a MUCH deeper meaning.  The dying elephant memory that Jonas recieved could represent the MEMORIES, which are dying. (what do elephants have? a GOOD MEMORY.) I NEVER would have come to that conclusion until we had a class discussion... <br />     I've discussed this book with several of my friends and we all love this book. It covers all the topics we have/will come across in this world--in the past, present, and most likely the future.  Perhaps Jonas may have traveled in a large circle back to his own community where the memories were released and things were back to normal with both love AND pain...Perhaps the music he heard was the Giver finally joining his beloved Rosemary. Who knows? This is a great book which made ME certainly think: would I rather live a life with color, music, love, pain, war,and  hatred... or one without? The answer can only be up to you, along with the ending, which is one of the several reasons I have debated, reviewed, and loved THE GIVER.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I don't get Ricky Wright's review--perhaps he is too old to understand the lyrics of a bright young man trying to make it in this world?  Regardless, I find it ironic that Mayer placed the well-played single No Such Thing at the very top of his playlist.  This song barely scratches the surface compared to the other songs that follow.  Each song lyrically and musically grows in maturity along the way, leaving the radio single in the dust and leaves you begging for more.  My personal favorite is Neon, followed closely by 83. And dude, (Mr. Wright) every kid back in 1983 had a lunch box--so don't give ... about a brown bag (talk about a \\"square\\"!).  I remember mine well, it was a Smurf lunch box and I also had a Wonderwoman lunch box.  Both collectors items now, so when he sings \\"What ever happened to my lunch box? And don't you think when it was thrown away, I should have had a say in that decision?\\" I just want to yell \\"Right-On!\\" and ask my Mom what she did with that old lunchbox.  Anyway, I digress.  The point is, that even though Mayer sings about \\"quarter-life\\" crises and lunch boxes and lost-loves (or loves that never were), these are things that all 25 year olds live through, think, and reminensce about. So if you can't relate to the lyrics(because your too old or too young), the tunes themselves are definately worth it.  His musical talent shines in everyway, its fresh, savvy, and jazzy and I really can't wait until he makes a new album!
0792844890|4.0|Mel Brooks is a comic genius. Although Young Frankenstein is still my absolute favorite (followed closely by Blazing Saddles)Spaceballs is a fun frolic the paradies all the science fiction films to that time.<br />Mainly mirroring the Star Wars universe with little jabs at the Star Trek universe - it visually matches the sets design and costuming of Star Wars.<br />Bill Pulman and Daphnie Zuniga are histerical. And there are a ton of cameo appreances. Mel Brooks himself (also writer and director) plays two roles...the most notable...the all powerful, the all knowing, the all wise - YOGERT. (A Yoda rip-off.)<br />This film is funny and fun. Mel Brooks has one of the most creative minds in the industry. His wife, Ann bancroft must be in histerics all the time! I loved this movie!
B000002GYW|5.0|This is one of my Top Ten All Time Favorite Albums. As a &quot;concept album&quot; it ranks with Willie Nelson's Red Headed Stranger. Everyone should be familiar with the title song but every song here is good and some are great.<BR>I highly recomend it.
0767812166|5.0|This was Jeff Bridges best performance for me. In contrast to his most recent film K-PAX (about anothe supposed alien), Jeff received an Acadamy Award nomination for this film. And he deserved it.<br />Directed by John Carpenter (Holloween, Chrisine, Escape From New YOrk and Vampires) this story tells the tale of a visitor from another world taking the form of a deseased truck driver and learning what there is to learn about the human race.<br />It also stars Karen Allen fresh from her gig on Raiders OF The Lost Ark. Both give a stellar performance but Jeff gives the alien a subtlty that makes you belive this entity is learning about his &quot;physical being&quot;. He has special powers and often uses them to &quot;save&quot; life, but he can't understand why.<br />A scientist on his side (the FBI is trying to capture and disect him) asks him why he is here and in response the alien replies - &quot;Do you know what I find most beautiful about your people? You are at your very best when things are worse.&quot;<br />That statemnet hit home and made the point of the film very clear. It's got romance, action adventure and lots of special effects. I just wish the DVD had a commentary with Jeff Brtidges and Karen Allen. That would be interesting!
B000063S6Z|4.0|Moby's latest contains music at once austere, ethereal and simply beautiful. It is music for thinking, ruminating and lingering to. It is music of solace, of splendid isolation. It is music of joyful congregation.<br /><br />It is the music of another orb.<br /><br />In an age of instant gratification and nano-second attention spans, it's no wonder so many find so little in it. Dismiss it as too-similar to previous albums.<br /><br />An album this resonant, this haunting needs to be explored.<br /><br />Take the time.
B00005ASOI|5.0|SUSPIRIA is nothing short of austounding. A tour de force of rich colors, strange music, and mind-numbing suspense. One of the few horror films that gets to me. The sound is good and the transfer complements greatly on the cinemtography. The music video is awesome and trailers are good. However, I feel that they give away the film's key scenes. It's best to watch the movie without the trailer first. Watch it in the dark, but not alone!

B000002UAI|4.0|TRACK BY TRACK:<br />1. no reply: mainly a lennon song, a good rocker to open the album.<BR>2.im loser: a blues/folk/country the first introspective lennon song.<BR>3.baby´s in black: a waltz-rock written by paul and john( a true 50-50 colaboration according to BOTH) NOT by john like some missinformed people said here, in fact some people reduced paul's role to two songs when according to paul and john 4 songs of this album are  written mostly by paul( eight days a week,every little thing , what youre doing and I'll follow the sun) and one was a true co-written effort between them(baby's in black). I invite to all that people to investigate  a little before they  write  a review.if you have any doubt about this information, buy the lennon last major interview book (the plaboy interviews) or paul mccartney interviews book \\"many years from now\\", or if you dont wanna spend money go to the web page the beatles ultimate experience which have  many interviews about  the beatles songs and is  a great site. <BR>4.rock and roll music: a chuck berry cover sung by lennon.<BR>5.I'll follow  the sun: written by McCartney in 1959 a beautiful latin folk melody.<BR>6.mr moonlight: the first bad song in the album , a weak gospel cover of this dr feelgood song.<BR>7.kansas city/hey hey hey: a little richard rocker, screamed by paul.<BR>8.eight days week: this pop-rock song is mainly a mccartney song, its not clear who give paul  that phrase :  john's chaffeur or ringo. john said in 1980 :\\"eight days a week  was paul's effort at getting the single for the movie(the second movie:help).eight days was never a good song.it was his initial effort, but i think both worked on it. i'm not sure.it was lousy anyway\\". so for  the one who said here paul is the popster but he didnt wrote eight days a week ,I got good news for you, yes, it was paul who wrote the main part of the song  not john.this song was sung by paul and john in unison not only by john,when paul sings in the same key with john,john's voice tend to sounds louder than paul's(similar cases i wanna hold your hand, from  me to you  and every little thing). if you have any doubt go and listen anthology 1 version live in the studio , and you will hear two voices singing which proves that is not only john double tracked, is  paul and john singing together.<BR>9.words of love: paul and john duet sung this holly pop song.<BR>10..every little thing: a mccartney  song written for jane asher and  another try of mccartney to write a mighty single.<BR>11.honey dont: the second weak track, a country-blues song sung by ringo.<BR>12.i dont want to spoil the party: a country lennon song, with john and paul alternating the high and low  vocal parts.<BR>13.what youre doing: a surf rocker  by mccartney,sad lyrics but happy rythm.<BR>14.everybody trying to be my baby: the second carl perkins cover in this album(the first is honey dont).<BR>i wanna make clear , I admire BOTH paul and john at the same level, but I hate that some people dont give the right credit to the right beatle(sadly but not surprising ,most of times, is paul the  affected  by this mistakes).with my review im trying to give the credit for certain songs to the one who really deserve it , and in this case is paul.<BR>paul didnt take the back seat in beatles for sale(like someone said here) ,in fact he wrote 4 and lennon wrote 3, and together 1. Maybe paul take the back seat in hard days night ,but in beatles for sale  he is on  front seat in the driving wheel.<BR> PS:please,forget my possible gramatical errors, my native lenguage is spanish.
B000002I6V|5.0|After CSN&Y more or less disbanded each member began their solo careers.  At the time (1971) CSN&Y were at the peak of their popularity.  So each member's solo debut was quite popular.  Crosby's was a dreamy, psychadelic rock 'n roll album.  Stills'  was a diverse album that had various styles of music.  Neil Young had already had a taste of solo success before CSN&Y but his post-CSN&Y debut was even more popular.  However unlike the other members Nash's effort was fairly down to earth.  It wasn't overblown or complex at all.  Nash just did one thing: he kept it simple.  By keeping it simple he made a fantastic singer song writer effort.<br />The opening track is MILITARY MADNESS an upbeat tune that discusses about war tearing up the country.  BETTER DAYS is a song that talks about lost love.  WOUNDED BIRD is a nice acousitc tune.  I USED TO BE KING is a impressive retrospective song.  BE YOURSELF is like a Bob Dylan acoustic.  SIMPLE MAN is another retrospective tune that has an echoing piano.  MAN IN THE MIRROR is a nice country rock style tune.  THERE'S ONLY ONE is another wonderful tune.  SLEEP SONG is a beautiful acoustic love ballad.  CHICAGO was the huge hit from this album.  A  great philoso-rock tune that tells us \\"we can change the world\\".  An added closing tune here is WE CAN CHANGE THE WORLD which seems to be some out take from the CHICAGO session.<br />'Songs For Beginners' is a wonderful album it reached the top twenty partly because of the success of the CHICAGO single.  However don't let that turn you off every song on this album is a gem and some even surpass CHICAGO.  <br />In conclusion Songs For Beginners is a must.  It is a very simple down to earth album with just acoustic guitar and piano with wonderful singing.  It is trulya singer/ song writer masterpiece that delivers a beautiful message.  Highly recommended!
B00005R2IS|5.0|This movie is must for any serious collector of Australian cinema or action movies. Apart from launching Mel Gison as an actor, and becoming one of the highlights of George Miller's directing career, this movie clearly reveals that big budgets are not a necessary precondition for good movies.<br />Mad Max is a superb blend of good acting and great cinematography that produce a movie which is far more credible as a depiction of a decaying world that most Hollywood productions.<br />Most other reviews of this movie will tell you the plot, let me give you some advice: watch this movie in the original Australian soundtrack. The dubbed American version subtracts most of the atmosphere and feel of this movie.

B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down (BHD), is probably one of the most realistic movies I have seen since Saving Private Ryan. The movie follows \\"America's Elite\\" Delta Force and Task Force Ranger. On October 3rd 1993, Delta and Ranger forces combine to capture Mohammed Farrah Aidid's top Lietenants, and escape the city. As they do so, two Black Hawk helicopters get shot down, bringing an entire city upon them. BHD is the best modern war film ever made. There's no patriotism, no real winner, just real war. Definately a reccommended buy if you're a history buff and/or just like good movies.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Before I go into detail about this DVD collection, I would like to say what an outrage it is that THE GODFATHER PART III has not gotten any of the credit it deserves. For the third Godfather has the most emotional depth out of the three, and also, while not being the best in the series (that honor belongs to PART II), it is superior in many ways to the original two films. The last 15 minutes is a tragic, bloody, Shakespearean ending with a strong message. Also the conspiracy theory involving the Vatican is a nice touch. Give this film a chance. The people who put it down probably never even saw it all the way through.<br />This DVD collection has a total of 5 discs. Don't be alarmed when you see that the first four have no extras except audio options and a chapter index. The real Bonus Material bounty is in the fifth disc, which contains a horde of extras mentioned in Amazon's summary. There's even a funny little easter egg hidden on the disc which allows you to hear \\"Bada-bing-bada-boom\\" in several different languages.<br />The first Godfather is a classic. Marlon Brando with his cottonball-amplified mouth as Vito Corleone, all the memorable scenes, and, most importantly, our first introduction to the Corleone family. The story begins in the late 40's where a man named Sollozzo offers the family an investment in the dangerous new business of drugs. Vito Corleone turns the offer down, fearing that he would lose respect and power if he took to such a scheme, but lives to regret it. Things start to twist until the point where you'll be surprised how things turned out in the end.<br />The second is a bit more complicated. Acting as both a prequel and a sequel to the original, there are scenes spliced together taking place both before and after the events of the 1972 GODFATHER. We learn how young Vito fled from Sicily to evade a ruthless gangster, and came to save a community from the clutches of a tyrant. Meanwhile, Michale Corleone is struggling to battle both an inside attack on the family as well as a senate hearing against his family and his father's name. The longest of the series by a longshot, but also digs the deepest. The time goes by in a flash leaving you the desire to see it again, a rare trait of such a long film.<br />This boxset is a great gift for any fan/casual viewer/newcomer of the Godfather series. It is true that III chooses a different style than the others, but it is marvelous in its own rights and deserves a better reputation than the one it was so cruelly thrown upon.
0393317552|5.0|In this book, Jared Diamond attempts to answer the question: \\"Why did the Europeans invade other countries and temporarily take over, and not the other way around?\\"  He escapes racism and approaches the question like it should be approached - from the world's viewpoint, where all people are equal.  His answer to this question, as he unravels it in the book, is that Europeans had guns, germs, and steel in their favor, a result of living in the environment and the area of the world they lived in.  He provides numerous examples to support his ideas.  What I found very rewarding about this book was his knowledge of world history.  He breaks down the book into chapters covering important countries and continents of the world and explains why at certain points in world history they may have held the most advanced civilization and why they remained that way or why they faltered.  It draws more on geography and biology than anything else for examples.  I am very glad that someone has finally put down in one cohesive book what all the biologists, ecologists, and geologists have been thinking for all these years.
B000002ADT|5.0|I'll keep it short and simple (As I'm writing this review there already exist almost 400 reviews for this album).  If you know anything or want to know anything about music, buy this album.  One of the greatest musical achievements of our time.  You can't say enough about Miles Davis, and &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is probably his finest ever.  This was my first Davis album and remains my favorate.  No excuses, if you consider yourself someone who loves music, buy this album now...right now, press the little button that says 'add to shopping cart.'
B00005U122|5.0|If you remained a Pink Floyd fan through its post-Waters era, then you may find your loyalties challenged by this DVD concert.  I found the &quot;Pulse&quot; concert (laserdisc version - crisp and clear audio and video) to be damn near perfect.  But Waters has raised the bar with &quot;In The Flesh&quot;.  The band is tight, the execution is flawless!  Waters mixes equal parts old Floyd material and his solo material, which is equally good if perhaps a bit more political in nature.  If this concert and tour had been presented on the massive stadium scale of Pink Floyd's last two tours, then we would have been in for a real spectacle.  But the leaner, meaner Roger Waters lets the music and musicianship do the talking for him.  Great show, substantial length, and most of the band sits down for a brief game of cards about 2/3 through it.  If you are a Pink Floyd and Roger Waters fan, this DVD will be your favorite.  If you aren't a fan (or are just a casual fan), then you will wonder why your other concert DVD's aren't this good.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem's new album is exactly what the title says, a show. And great one at that!! This album is the perfect blend of rock guitar riffs and hip hop beats. Anyone that has ever wondered about the life of this rap star should just listen to the album. The Eminem Show is Marshall's life plain and simple. However, plain and simple are not two words that should be used to describe the content of the cd. This cd is filled with the many emotions that make up Marshall Mathers the person as well as emienm the hip hop icon. After a crazy year filled with law suits, divorce and felony charges Slim Shady came out on top in 2002! Showing the world that it takes more than that to silence this \\"pitbull of his leash!\\" This album shows eminem's growth as both a person and a lyricist. And shows that eminem is an artist that has true staying power. This record is definitly worth your money!
B00005JKCF|1.0|I mean, besides Tobey Maguire looking kinda fine, this movie would be more of a flop to the critics than it is to me. It's categorized as an action film - I don't see any \\"heart-stopping\\" action in it. It was basically a typical childish love story about a losery guy who's had a crush on a girl for a very long time and once he's become a superhero he saves her life over and over again (all of which they weren't even believable) he falls for her and she falls for him and so on.<BR>Conclusion? I want my two hours and my $... back.

0440224764|1.0|Three observations:<br />1. I guess I was supposed to root for the protaganist. But as far as I could tell, he was just a thief. The fact that he was smart, tenacious, etc., didn't change that.<br />2. Why did total strangers love him -- giving him special treatment at the hospital, constant favors, etc.? Grisham didn't give us any reason to understand why he elicited these responses from everyone he met.<br />3. Unlike some other readers, I loved the ending -- again, he was just a thief, and he may have charmed everyone else but didn't charm me, and the ending suited me fine.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have not heard much music (if any) in the past few years where I thought \\"Wow, that's great stuff!\\" and I said that with this album. Everything about it is wonderful, great voice, the songwriting, lyrics, music, everything.  ...
B00000055E|4.0|This cd is good for when it came out. He made these songs when rap was changin thats why it got alot of older soundin beats. But his lyrics is tight on here and that is what makes the cd not the beats. For everyone who said this cd is weak you dont know what music is but I do thats why I get the most out of every cd. For those of you who understands music sit down with this cd and you wont be disappionted trust me.
B00005OWEG|4.0|I'm not sure if being a combatant my first time in the Viet-Nam conflict would have left me with a feel for this movie.  Certainly, my second tour left me very knowing about a heart of darkness that we all must look at... embrace, and then discard.  And knowing this about myself, I prefer this movie's original version.  Those things that were cut from the original, and shown here on redux, are appropriately cut.<br />Most of the film not in the original are tiny snipets.  The longest section is about a French plantation the PBR happens upon.  I suppose the intent was to demonstrate how firmly the French were entreanched in Viet-Nam before we ever got there.  It really does nothing for the film, and belonged on the cutting room floor.<br />There's another section that shows all the PBR crew getting over with the USO ladies.  (We who were there would have given anything to just be near a &quot;round eye'd girl&quot;.  Kinda fun scene, but again, not really doing anything for the movie.<br />These edited-in parts mostly distract from the original version.  They were cut by someone smart.  Just my opinion.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|A great DVD, a pleasure to experience and the extra features are a lot of fun, particularly the documentary on Ms. Jolie's training for the physical stunts.<br />Personally, I enjoy this movie for a variety of reasons. Angelina Jolie makes a perfect Lara Croft, for one thing. The movie looks fabulous, moves quickly, has a rather original design in terms of sets and locations, and the effects are spectacular without overwhelming the characters. Jolie makes Croft such a strong and convincing presence, and is so athletic and graceful in the physical stuff, that it is a joy to watch her -- and she's on screen almost every minute.<br />The film is based on a videogame, but this movie is more cohesive and better plotted than some of the James Bond entries I can think of, and stunningly executed.<br />It's a showcase for Ms. Jolie of course, and I can't see anyone else being as good at doing Lara. I never played the videogames, so I came at this movie fresh. I think Jolie creates a character as strong and well rounded as, say, Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones or Connery's Bond. Even though these movies have somewhat improbable premises and lots of effects, the actors remain firmly out front. Ms. Jolie achieves this with at least as much finesse and graceful detail as either of the other examples. And in all cases, the tone of the films is on solid footing, with sure direction, and never waivers.<br />Finally, Ms. Jolie executes her physical action very realistically and artfully, looking quite comfortable and competent all the way. The bungie ballet alone is worth the price of admission in TOMB RAIDER (extra safety wires erased via computer notwithstanding). It's quite a tour de force, particularly for an actor as versatile as Ms. Jolie, who, don't forget, received justifiable critical acclaim previously in GIRL INTERRUPTED.<br />It's a great popcorn movie of course, and a better movie all around than many big-budget fantasy films I could list that have less going on and more trouble taking themselves seriously.<br />I like the strong female character and the father-daughter underpinnings for the storyline as well. All in all, for a movie that started out as a videogame, this is surprising and I've easily watched it several times for the pure pleasure of its entertainment and lack of pretension -- and the convincing, mesmerizing perfection of Ms. Jolie.more trouble taking themselves seriously. <br />I like the strong female character and the father-daughter underpinnings for the storyline as well.

B00004TJKI|4.0|When I watch this movie, I must confess that I am being distracted by the music. The late, great musicologist Martin Williams one remarked that it's a bad score, as it takes away one's attention from the story. Fortunately, the music score is available in (almost) its entirety. Composed and arranged by Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, you can listen to it on Columbia/Legacy CK 65569, [....] I think the music will still be listened to in 50 years, when the story, the movie will be forgotten. But ... you can see the Duke in the movie, and listen to him while Jimmy Stewart 'plays' the piano ... That's why \\"d give 4 stars to this DVD.<br />Loek Hopstaken
0767819543|5.0|A profound story, an exploration of redemption and growth laced with symbolism and emotional depth, yet not sentimental. Well-directed and perfectly acted.<br />Very few movies are this good.<br />Also offers beautiful and fascinating glimpses of Brazilian religion.
0451169514|5.0|Of all the King stories I have read, this one is my favorite. The story is very well written, and follows two time lines at once, coming to a very strong climax.

B00005QG9J|5.0|I never knew anything about incubus before a few months ago when i decided to download a song or two just to see what they were all about, because i have to say i really doubted them and thought there would be nothing to their music. but i was soo wrong!! The best aspect of their music is their lyrics which don't even compare to any other musicians, they are on a whole other level! They are so deep and touching, the words are like poetry in most of the songs. The actual music is just incredible and there isnt one song that i dislike on this cd...it takes a while to get used to some but i have grown to love them all...i even get shivers when i listen to some of the songs because they really get inside you, and you can relate to most of the lyrics, and its really amazing the language they use to desribe ordinary things....definititly buy this cd, its a truly great and different experience! if you want to download some of their songs, try 11 AM and Nice to you know you. Also under my umbrella is different but so awesome!!
B000053VAF|5.0|First off, I am not part of the two groups that can relate most to Kevin Smith's Magnus opus \\"Dogma\\", i.e. Catholics and stoners. That said, I love this movie. One thing it shows is that, besides being able to write funny, satiric dialogue, Kevin Smith is well versed in the intricacies of Catholicism; how else would he be able to see a potential loophole through which two angels would be able to rise back to heaven? And the film is also filled with great performances. Ben Affleck and Matt Daemon give great performances as the two angels. Chris Rock is as funny as ever as Rufus. Salma Hayek simmers. Alanis Morsette is inspired casting as God (I guess as God had to be a woman, Eric Clapton was out). As for Jay and Silent Bob, you never can tell exactly how much of what's going on Jay understands, while Kevin Smith's Bob has a great expression on his face whenever Jay makes a fool of himself. However, the three best performances are delivered by George Cartlin as Cardinal Glick, Alan Rickman as Meddatron (just as good as he was in the original \\"Die Hard\\") and, of course, the unflappable Jason Lee as Azriel. His is a completely original performance for, though he wants to end the world, you can see the fear of the hell he resides in his eyes. Perhaps \\"Dogma\\" is a bit preachy. But with the majority of the country not in any church at all, is that really such a bad thing?
B000065V1V|5.0|At last a Bowie CD that leaves you wanting for more! I especially felt that strange feeling while listening to the first track, Sunday. Almost at the end of the song, it gets very rythmic with strong bass and drums,and even louder than the rest of the song . But for some reason David decided to then just die the song's end out, lowering the volume!!! You just want to tell David: I want more!! Don't end it now!! Keep it loud !! But he does end it by slowly fading it away. Oh well, what can a simple mortal do??? I get nothing by getting frustrated. I have the extra CD package that includes a Moby arrangement of the same song, Sunday. Sorry Moby,a great arrangement, but I like David's version better. The other songs are just marvelous, an ethereal, almost mystic sound throughout the CD. A great triumph for Maestro Bowie!!! Give us more of that David!! You hit a home run this time.
B000002MJC|5.0|I bought this album back in 1994 after i saw the video of &quot;I feel you&quot;. Till that day i really wasn't very interested in Depeche Mode because they had always sounded me as one of the cheesy pop-synth bands of 80's.<br />Songs of Faith&amp;Devotion is really different from all of the Depeche albums. First of all, this album is more a rock album rather than a pop album. The songs are very dark, maybe reflecting the personal world of Dave Gahan during that period, because i remember he tried to commit suicide during those years.<br />I just bought this album for a try, but it really became a classic for me. This album doesn't catch you in the first go, but after you listen to it for a several times you can't stop listening to it. I honestly give 5 stars to all the songs (music and lyrics). My personal favorites are &quot;In Your Room&quot;, &quot;Rush&quot;, &quot;One Caress&quot;, and &quot;walking in my shoes&quot;. Also I strongly recommend the single version of &quot;In your room&quot; if you can find it.
B000066F6H|4.0|a little bit Sex Pistols tempered with Joy Division spiced up with The Ramones. Fun, exciting listen.  Neo/post-modern punk with great energy.  Buy it!!!
B00005JKJA|5.0|I'm not going to give away the plot details of the story like so many other reviewers have done here because I honestly feel that doing so will only compromise the artistry and impact of this film.  But I have to say that I am completely flabbergasted by how many people did not get this movie!  So many of today's movies want to be so blatantly obvious, and force their linear stories down our throats. I'm so tired of watching predictable plots that have neither substance nor appeal. And what makes me even crazier is that most of the studios, and worse yet many directors (and some actors) are convinced that this is what we all want!  They think we're all babies that need to be spoon-fed a story in excruciating detail, instead of letting us connect-the-dots on our own! Then along comes this obscure little movie that I hardly knew anything about.  I expected it to be pretty much the same as all the rest of those boring movies. Boy was I in for a surprise!  All at once I get thrown into this abstract dream sequence that keeps me transfixed from beginning to end. So much so, that I couldn't sleep and I had to watch the movie again to try to fit the pieces together. That same night I had a long weird dream of my own.  And I was suddenly reminded that our own dreams don't always make much sense either. Until we take a closer look.  Well, then the whole movie finally made sense to me!  In this movie David Lynch shows us how every subtle detail of our lives can wander into our sub-conscious. The people in our lives, as well as those on the periphery. The strangers that we see, but don't really notice. The stories we hear. Or the conversations that we accidentally (or purposely) eavesdrop. Our hopes and expectations, our disappointments, our fantasies can all appear in our dreams as some sort of twisted tale that winds in and out of our deepest thoughts, our most secret feelings, and even our gritty reality. Everything we know about ourselves, and even that which we cannot orwill not admit to ourselves can be stolen from our sub-conscious mind and somehow wind up in our most vivid dreams.  So for those of you who didn't get this movie, open your eyes!  For every question that you may have about this movie, the answer is right there within the movie.  The director leaves clues everywhere!  If you would just take a closer look.  David Lynch practically spoon-feeds us all of the details - just not in such a blatantly obvious way.  He did what no other director is willing to do?  He makes us work out the story for ourselves...with our own insights and interpretations. And I find that to be the best part of this movie...the fact that the director forces me to be a participant!  Finally, I get to be the lead detective in the story!  Watch this movie again and again. It gets better every time!  And you will \\"get it\\" at some point.  And even if you don't...oh, what a beautiful and intriguing ride it is!  Laura Harring is astonishing and mesmerizing as the mysterious damsel/femme fatale! And Naomi Watts is absolutely unforgettable!
B000066JES|2.0|I also have been a Manowar fan since 1982 when Battle Hyms was first released.First of all; I can't beleive it took them over 6 years to release a new studio album!! Second; After 6 years they give us only 48 minutes of music?? Actually it's a lot less than 48 minutes.An Elvis cover tune,and an Italian Opera cover tune?? So, we are actually getting less than 40 minutes of new original material after 6 years? What happened to the old intricate songwriting days of Battle Hyms,Hail To England,Into Glory Ride and Sign of the Hammer? Joey always played some incredible Bass on those albums,like &quot;Guyana Cult of the Damned&quot;.The writing on this album is so basic and uncreative.
B000002952|5.0|&iexcl;Mi coraz&oacute;n y alma canta con este CD -- y as&iacute; que voluntad el tuyo! (My heart and soul sings with this CD -- and so will yours!) Okay, so you can't read spanish -- I am pretty bad myself. But whether or not you know Spanish doesn't matter when it comes to this CD. You'll LOVE it. It is one of those rare CD's that I play over and over and over and over again without realizing it. It lifts my spirits, moves my feet and makes me dance!<br /><br />MI TIERRA is not only a Grammy winner, it is a masterpiece. I have always loved Gloria Estefan (and the Miami Sound Machine) so this was a natural selection for me. All the cuts are great and it is hard to pick my favorites but definately Mi Tierra (my land or homeland), No Hay Mal Que Por Bien No Venga (Out of all bad some good things come), Si Senior (Yes, sir its my s-o-n [an Afro-Cuban rhythm]) and Montuno (Montuno --another Afro-Cuban rhythm) top the list. The arrangements and the musicians on this CD are spectacular.<br /><br />If you are interested (or even care) there are English translations included within the CD jacket. If you are looking for a change and a CD that you'll never tire of -- try this one. All I can say is, &quot;Cante Gloria cantan. No puedo conseguir bastantes.&quot; (Sing Gloria sing. I can't get enough.)<br />;-)
B00005JKCF|5.0|I'm not actually a comic book fan. in fact, I think that most comic book series get repetative after the third mastermind is introduced, but I have to give this movie 5 stars. I always thoroughly \\"spoil\\" myself with other reviews before I see a movie, and I have to say that all the criticisms are completely unfounded. The acting is top-notch, the story (bit with plot) was very engrossing and believable, and the Green Goblin costume (exept the head) looked exactly like I'd imagine a top-of-the-line military bodysuit to look like. The only weird bit was that the military would request a goblin motif for their next-gen supersoldier suit. Oh, and, What happened to the Spider?
B000002HO3|5.0|I don't own many greatest hits but when attempting to discern what CD's to add to my stack this one definately caught my eye. Although I have always enjoyed Mick Hucknall, STARS definately caught my attention back in the early 90's. You will find many cuts from STARS and A NEW FLAME --plus some other favorites. Worth the change!!
0060931671|3.0|Wow. What does it all mean? I see glimpses of brilliance but have trouble piecing it all together -- much like the main character Oedipa. Maybe the joke's on me.<br />This was a tough book. There must be 500 pages crammed into the 150  I read. Given that I'm going to need to read some interpretation to figure out what I read that may turn out to be literally true.<br />This probably is a great book. I'm just not smart enough to make that judgement. It was work trying to figure it out.<br />I kept thinking it had something to do with religion but who knows?<br />BTW, in many ways it reminded me of Still Life with Woodpecker by Tom Robbins or The Bushwhacked Piano by Thomas McGuane.

B00005OAIE|1.0|I bought the low priced album because I liked the first song which plays like crazy on the air waves but I couldn't even get past the 4th song without yawning and believe me, I get my sleep! Pass this one up. Waste of money.
0783222955|5.0|Gregory Peck gives one of the most memorable performances ever as Atticus Finch, a lawyer with two children in the rural south.  Finch is defending a black man who has been accused of assaulting a white woman.  The trial introduces Finch's children, Jem and Scout, to racism and to tragedy.<br /><br />Peck is superb as the noble lawyer and tender father.  The story is sweet and sobering; very thought-provoking.  I heartily recommend this unforgettable film.
079073320X|4.0|I too have seen the movie N many times and have even read the<br />book, and as a result, I too appreciate how much better the movie is than<br />the book, and here is why:<br />Here is Why the Movie 'Contact' improves on Sagan's original book IMHO:<br />1. it is not clear why there is no explanation in the SETI message of what the<br />  object of the trip is to be, i.e. why go?  In the  book the aliens evidently<br />  cant resist showing us the equivalent of  their hobby room, just like a nerdy<br />  earthling,  'hey come on over  and look at my widgets' (see pg 364 \\"that's<br />  what we mainly do - engineering\\")  But in the movie, there is zero technical<br />  presentation from the alien contact,  only a spiritual connection, so<br />  evidently the purely technical nature of  the original message was a trick or<br />  lure to fool a techie-obsessed culture into being directly shown by an<br />  'incredibly technologically advanced' civilisation that, 'hey, that's not<br />  where it's at, loving one another is where it's at'.<br />2. Removing the technical content from the actual contact experience  was a<br />  stroke of genius and greatly increased the power of the movie, and gave it a<br />  subtlety missing in Sagan's book.<br />3. Sagan's vision of the alien's interests are just extrapolations on his<br />  own.  He evidently would like to design galaxies.<br />  Also, the aliens are not motivated by a quest for knowledge, but out<br />  of boredom.  (pg 364: \\"no new galaxies .. just the same old crowd.<br />  Everything's getting run down. It'll be boring.\\")<br />  (\\"Against boredom, the gods themselves struggle in vain.\\" - Nietzsche)<br />  In the movie, the aliens are evidently motivated out of love, there is<br />  no hint that they are bored.<br />  \\"See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the<br />  emptiness bearable, is each other.\\"<br />  -Dad-prime<br />4. Sagan tries to make the case that a scientist's experience of the<br />  'numinous' in calculating pi to N-billion digits is on a par with the<br />  religious experience of the numinous.  He misses the point that one<br />  person's calculation makes another's irrelevant and redundant, whereas<br />  one person's religious experience of the numinous, does not make<br />  another's redundant.  This the message of Ellie after the return:<br />  'I wish everyone could have this experience'.  She is cast in the<br />  classic position of every earth mystic in history, rendered incapable<br />  of conveying the numinosity but yearning for everyone to participate.<br />  Yet both the book and movie fail in making the leap to the religious<br />  experience of the numinous as being valuable precisely because it is<br />  available to all and not dependent on a BIG EXPENSIVE MACHINE.<br />All this is not to denigrate Sagan's book which I enjoyed.  And I think he<br />might agree the movie improved on his original concept in ways he hadnt<br />thought of, and I am sure he would have delighted in the unforeseen<br />improvements, like a real scientist.<br />Rest In Bliss, Carl, we love ya :)<br />------------------------<br />\\"They said that's the way it's been done for billions of years.\\"<br />-Ellie
B00004U2HK|5.0|This is one of the best movie musicals of all time. It tells the true story of novice nun Maria, who is sent to be a nanny for a retired captain (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children. The captain is still sad over the loss of his wife, and distances himself from the kids. He becomes engaged to a snooty baroness (Eleanor Parker), who dislikes children and is especially jealous of the pretty, young novice. Maria is quite the singer, and in no time she has the kids, and their father, singing Austrian folksongs all over the countryside, and soon, she and the captain marry. The story takes a serious turn as Germany annexes Austria, and the captain is ordered to report for duty in Hitler's forces.<br />Julie Andrews radiates confidence and joy in song after song, many of which have become familiar to everyone, especially Edelweiss, Doe, A Deer, and My Favorite Things. Her voice is pitch perfect and she looks great with Christopher Plummer. Salzburg is so beautiful, no wonder they sang all the time. This is a charming, romantic, and exciting musical the whole family will enjoy.
B00000F3KL|2.0|After watching the movie and reading a majority of the previous reviews I sense a couple of things:<br />1. Many of the praise toward Black Hawk Down comes from the fact that it shows \\"what really happened\\", or at least in the eyes of a soldier.  They have to endure the chaos and get out.  To be diligent, that is what makes a soldier honorable. <br />2.  As a result, Ridley Scott could ignore all of the politics and social aspects of the war. Instead this was a movie about taking orders and grin and bear it.<br />3. Because this is Hollywood produced entertainment, Ridley Scott easily succeeded in fascinating, shocking, and capitivating viewers over the chaotic violence of war. We cheer when they kill those savage Somolians (mission success).  <br />4. Unfortunately Ridley Scott possesses the audience with these basic primitive fight-or-flight feelings and attempts to do little else.<br />5.  Because this is really a historical fiction movie, we need plot (beginning, middle, and end), we need genuine characters that live in the world the director creates, we need a moral to the story that gives us a new perspective on war (than just the typical soldier logic they add in).  That's what makes a story, everything else is just illusion.<br />6. As others have suggested (and I have not read the book version or read up on what really happened) the message of this bit of current history would have been better portrayed as a documentary.  Instead of exploiting the story for it's entertainment value, we could actually seek to understand the conflict in all it's political and social complexity.  <br />7.  As a sad commentary on our times, this MTV dominated world craves raw emotion and visual power. If you look at Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates, Behind Enemy Lines, and most likely Pearl Harbor (though I haven't seen it) their pure power is the visceral, dramatic, gritty, realistic imagery.  That's blockbuster language, that sells products (Note: the director of Behind Enemy Lines was a successful producer of TV commercials), but that doesn't make a good story.  <br />8. If you are out for profit, then all the elements that make a good story don't matter. Appearance is everything.  This, Ridley Scott understands.  And to his shame, that is all he understands.<br />Much of what has destroyed today's movie-going experience is all of the dramatic hype.  Anymore, all that the director/producer expects is that we are in it for the ride.  So just throw in a bunch of stereotypes and watch the chain reaction.  Or better yet, read some classic novels and sink your teeth into some real meat.

B000065U1N|5.0|BLACK HAWK DOWN (2001) **** of 4<br />MPAA RATING: R (Intense, Graphic War Violence; Language) Stars: Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, William Fichtner, Thomas Guiry, Tom Sizemore. REVOLUTION STUDIOS.<br />Ridley Scott's uncompromising war epic, BLACK HAWK DOWN, is remarkable in its own field as an all-too graphic action-drama which focuses on the real life event of the 1993 battle in Mogadishu, Somalia.  <br />US Delta Force and American Rangers are sent into the starved city and infiltrate, only to be brutally attacked by the angry civilians.  Trapped under fire, the soldiers are forced to bear the pain-staking horrors of war.  The ending result of the attack left behind 19 American casualties, thousands of Somali casualties, and hundreds wounded.<br />The endurance of the battle is probably close to the harsh endurance of the film, being the film is so accurate and so devastatingly violent- it puts you in the front line and lets the war begin to fire right before you.  <br />The characters are a well-ensambled.  Josh Hartnett is at the top of the credits, however, numerous character are of subject matter as well.  There are a near twenty different focal points, but no matter, the view of the war remains the same.  The performances are well-done, believable, and separated, leaving no central character, but letting a memorable cast remain.<br />Producer, Jerry Bruckheimer (Pearl Harbor) lets Director, Ridley Scott (Gladiator) take charge, and that is probably the means of the brightness of the film.  \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is non-stop war, blood, guts, bullets, bombs, and mayhem.  It works so well because it is such a violent depiction of war, as if the actual event was filmed, and the ensamble events were puzzled together perfectly.  The visual effects and sound are top notch, and the Oscar Winning film editing is magnificent.<br />Above all else, Black Hawk Down is a fantastic and surreal war film.  It needs no central character, or central factor of presence; it needs no explanation for its graphic combat sequences.  It only departs leaving behind an unforgettable scenery of the brutalities of uncontrollable war.  Ridley Scott directs with triumph.  The film alone is a triumph.  You will never be closer to war than with \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"  It is quite a compelling ride, despite its uncompromising tone, and it holds true \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is one of the best films of the year.
1590710037|5.0|Throughout my work week I will occasionally hear David Byrne singing in my ear &quot;...you may ask yourself, how did I get here?&quot;. When do we make choices that take us away from our hearts desire? How do we begin to move towards being authentic without giving in to Dr. Phil and Oprah's self-improvementitise?<br />The War of Art is a work of serious regard by Steven Pressfield. If Jung and Joseph Campbell had a child and that offspring had a baby with the progeny of Steve Martin and Dennis Miller then you'd get close to the tone of The War of Art. In one moment your reading about greek myths or Blake then a qoute by the less than mystical Goldie Hawn.<br />I have read this book twice over the weekend and feel challenged to battle my resitance and start putting pen to paper. &quot;How did I get Here&quot; Who cares --- What am I doing right now?<br />This is a self-help book but a self-help book for people who think.
B00000ILDF|4.0|The movie is both good and bad. I'll give both reasons.<br />What is bad:<BR>The lines are just too unreal and read off-the-script. Some of my friends memorized most of the lines during the final chase scene after seeing it 2 times. The special effects are pretty dull, especially the alien effects. Next time, they should use more real puppets and things, not to rely on computers too much (You hear that George Lucas?). Also, most of my friends felt that killing the surviving characters from the second film, and killing her lover Dr. Clemmens, was too cruel and disappointing. I think that they had no choice but to kill Newt, for she would be to old to act in it, and it left Ripley all by herself, one-on-one with the Alien.<br />What is good: The POV of the alien as it chases the guys down the corridors is a neat effect and should be repeated in the later films. The music is fantastic (read my review on that if you like soundtracks). Ripley acts really well (she always has in the Alien Legacy) and her confrontation to kill herself boils up through the film until the end, and she shows that nervousness in her acting. Plus, the actual killing is very dramatic and could be found in classic literature, for it is one of the greatest internal conflicts a character could have.<br />The film did a good job but I guess money came into play when it came to special alien effects. David Fincher did good for one of his first movies (I think it was), so that could explain some difficulties that the movie shows.
B000066NW0|5.0|I'd heard about Avril when she first came out, and was very excited about getting her cd.  And I have to say, it has become my favorite cd.  She's has beautiful lyrics and great songs.<br />My favorite songs on the album are Complicated, Skaer Boi, and Nobody's Fool.  But, I love all the songs on the album.  I love the lyrics in I'm With You.  I also like the lyrics in Sk8er Boi, because they are cute, and it's my favorite song on the album.<br />Overall, this is an awesome cd!  I love it.  I even like it more than my Pink and No Doubt CD's.
B000065U1N|1.0|The movie was excellent, and the book was even better. No war movie (or narrative account) I have ever seen (or read) has captured the reality of combat as well as this one has, with the POSSIBLE exception of Saving Private Ryan (I can't say for sure as I was not present at the Normandy invasion, nor was I involved in any similar combat).<br />But for the life of me, I cannot fathom the answer to one simple question: Why in the world does this DVD not include digital surround sound support? Didn't Black Hawk Down win an Academy Award for Best Sound in 2001? (I have the DVD case sitting in front of me, and indeed it did.)<br />Had I taken the time to examine the case at my local retailer and seen that there was no digital surround sound, I never would have bought it.<br />Some may see this as nit-picky, and you may be right. The absence of digital surround in no way diminishes the story told, or the sacrifice made by our troops in October 1993. The film is still visually stunning, and the story is no less compelling.<br />BUT...<br />The reason we spend hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars on home theater equipment is so that we can have the next best thing to a theater experience in our homes. However, if the movie studios cannot include support for enhanced audio features on the DVD's they distribute, then we've basically wasted our money.<br />I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater, and had the DVD allowed for an enhanced viewing experience, a five-star rating would have been a no-brainer.<br />My advice- DO NOT purchase this DVD until the inevitable Special Edition comes out, which will assuredly include the enhanced features that this edition lacks. Until then, rent it.

B00004TRD8|5.0|James Cameron's Classic Masterpiece T2 is a brillent film achievment that could never be done over. This film has great depth more than what people think. This is not just an action picture but a great drama to. This movie came out on a incridable 2 disk DVD Which has three version's of the film. The best version of the film is a version with 20 minutes of extra footage put back into the movie. Instead of the movie being 139 minutes long its 159 minutes long. These extra minutes add more to the depth of the story and more to the charcter's devolpment. This is so much more than an action movie when you watch it think harder and enjoy the movie exsperince its a lot batter than just scraching the surface of the story. James Cameron's has made one of the best film's of all time. And the DVD makes the exsperince even better. The footage added to the movie gives so much more depth that you don't even need to see the first Terminator because it gives you so much it pretty much tells you what happend in the first one. I like the first one but there is no need for anybody too see the first one again because this super delux version of T2 exsplian's enough about the first Terminator so you don't half to watch the first one to refresh your memory. If you have never seen the first Terminator than you will half to watch the first one but for those of you who have seen it you don't need to go back and watch it unless you want to.

6300263673|5.0|The 80's. What a wonderful decade for some of us and more over  having a film like &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; to bring back memories of a time full of dreams, expectations, doubts and findings. The story of Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Hausmann and handsom Johnny Castle made me believe in true love, the kind of love that makes you dream, believe, be happy, feel the world in the palm of your hand and, eventhough it elapsed in the 60's, &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; love story was as true in the 80's as it is now. And no good movie can be complete without a good soundtrack interlacing images and music. This is absolutely clear when you think about songs like &quot;Hungry Eyes&quot; by Eric Carmen, &quot;Cry To Me&quot; by Solomon Burke, such a wonderful love song as &quot;She's Like the Wind&quot; so breathtakingly performed by Patrick Swayze and last, but no less alive in my mind, &quot;I've had the time of My Life&quot;, a premium closing song for a movie that deserves to be called &quot;A Landmark of the 80's. Don't miss it!

B000002KDS|5.0|Many fans believe this to be Alice Cooper's greatest album, and it is hard to argue. This is a hard rocking raucous foot stomping romp from beginning to end. Under My Wheels gets things off to a screaming start with the most slickly produced garage band song ever. Even though Alice Cooper always used tight flawless production their songs seemed somehow to be coming from the garage next door. It was just the irreverent attitude that permeated everything the band did.  Be My Lover is a solid groove about hooking up with a chick in a bar. Halo of Flies is a masterpiece of riffs and lyrics and theatrical studio jam. It's like a James Bond movie in your ears after a fifth of Seagrams. You Drive Me Nervous and Yeah Yeah Yeah are two more screaming guitar twanging trips into the garage. It's easy to feel you could pick up a guitar and play this yourself until you try it. Dead Babies is an sick classic with an infectious bass line that will get into your nodding head for weeks to come. Nice dark tongue-in-cheek lyrics complement the heavy musical riff. Killer is a foray into rock theatre that is a real treat. It follows a killer's walk up to the gallows, and subsequent hanging with a staple of operatic rock hooks that would be pirated by everyone from David Bowie to Kiss. <br />It's all over before you're ready and you'll likely get right up and put it right back on to hear again. Every song is a gem and still sound fresh and innovative while sounding almost spontaneous and very edgy.
B00004RFCM|5.0|This is the season that started it all!  I remember waiting for the series when it first started years ago.  I had read Candace Bushnell's novel when it was still fairly obscure but never dreamed the series would be as entertaining as it is.  This series will always serve as memories of my youth which I like to think I'm still in!  When I have grandchildren in the year 2030, I will lovingly pass the first, second, third and the series to follow, down to them to remind them that 'Granny' used to be hip!
6303148352|5.0|JURASSIC PARK. What more can be said about this brilliantly made film? Steven Spielberg is a creative genius, and this is the movie to prove it. Paired with the musical composer John Williams, every single moment of this movie leaves a cherished memory for me! From the moving moment when the first dinosaur in the film is shown, history is changed. The awe-inspiring size and gracefulness of the Brachiosaurus leaves the visitors to the park spellbound, and movie audiences in amazement. JURASSIC PARK started a revolution of what we think of dinosaurs today. They were not huge bumbling beasts with pea-sized brains. Actually, some of the dinosaurs were quite beautiful in their own way. Some were incredibly intelligent, too. With the cunning and deadly Velociraptor, audiences were kept on the edge of their seats and wondered what could limit the animals' abilities. The biggest star of the silver screen, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is the best villain and best redeemed character of any movie. Although he ravages through the park, escaping paddocks and killing visitors, the Rex ultimately saves the characters we really care about in the end from the ravenous raptor's certain attack. The movie teaches people to respect the wild of the natural world and to not play God. &quot;Life will find a way.&quot; ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT cinematography, musical score, book adaptation, and creation of realistic dinosaurs for a hard-to-impress generation. A classic.

B00003CXE7|4.0|Cool musical score by Hans Zimmer, Lots of special features, Spectacular cinematagraphy, Nicely choreographed fight &amp; battle arena scenes, And a great performance by Russel Crowe &amp; Connie Nielsen. Joahquin Phoenix seemed too scary for playing the part of the emperor but the movie came together nicely. Still I would recommend movies about ancient Rome from the 1950's. My favorite one from that era was Cleopatra. This review refers to the DVD edition.. Get it!
6301969294|4.0|The strong points in this film are the cinematography, the music score, the set design, and the faithfulness to the book. The weak point is the dialogue which the main characters have to deliver, its disjointed and  brusque quality leaving no scope for any physical expression in order for them not to appear wooden. Howard Roark and Gail Wynand come off very badly due to this failing,     One of the few scenes in which it wasn't a problem is the one in which Howard, Gail, and Dominique are chatting in the grounds of the Wynand's new home prior to going on a yachting trip.  In the book the same problem was apparent, but because here wasn't any actors involved to amplify the issue it didn't draw attention to itself as much as it did in the film -  but not by much.    As far as I could recall, the dialogue was pretty much straight from the book, aside from where scenes had been changed to fit in with the screenplay. And Roark's speech at the end was shorter in comparison to the book's, I thought.    Gripes aside, this is a well put together, good looking film.

B000065U1N|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I am glad I rented it before I purchased. The DVD packaging is well below average for a movie fan. The extra features are disappointing. This DVD is a rental only. Save your money for the special edition that will come out in a couple of months.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is my favorite of ALL TIME!! You'll love it, regardless of your age. It makes you laugh and almost even brings you to tears in the end. I love Mike and Sulley, they make such a pair-- and Randall (the slithery guy) makes the best villain! My favorite line of the movie : \\"mmmm...painted?\\" said by Mike. Okay, well I DEFINETELY recommend this film.
B00003CX5P|4.0|The Phantom Mencae is a great movie for star wars fans. It continues the great sega of star wars for fans to enjoy. I think it would be a great movie to keep and show to the next generation.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is a book about life and what we take for granted in it. Lowry shows all the different things that we do in every day life that in the utopian community, in the book, the people can not do. For example, the people get assigned their jobs, they dont have the freedom to chose it themselves. <br />I think The Giver is a great book to learn some of life's lessons from. Though Lowry contradicts her story a couple times it is over all an interesting book. I believe that every one should read this book.
B000063UR2|5.0|I was two years old when this movie was made. I was about five when I fell in love with it. Now that I'm almost twenty I gotta say it still has it's old charm. I just saw it for the first time in many years and while I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I did when I was younger, I was still satisfied. Tim Curry made this movie. He has got to be the most menacing villain of all. He scared the crud out of me when I was young and he's still a little spooky to watch in the dark even now. I think the movie drags on a tad though and the dialog is a bit cheesy. I think if it were made today when better special effects and a tighter script it would be fantastic. But it's still a good movie and stands on it's own. This movie also displays yet another ultra-cool hairstyle for Tom Cruise.

B000000LZV|5.0|I bought the LP in 1985 and fell in love; already had PROJECT MERSH, but it barely prepared me for DOUBLE NICKELS ON THE DIME. I agree with the politics--not everybody does. You'd have to be tone deaf, though, not to hear the pure superiority of these 3 guys. Mike Watt alone just makes me want to pound my head on the floor in amazement. He and George are even ahead of Foxton and Buckler in the early-80s rhythm section sweepstakes, and if you know those names you know what I mean. But D. was the front man and he put it over the top, with guitar, vocals, and lyrics. They covered every base except maybe the old fashioned love song. The only downside here is the limitation to the CD version. The LP is still in print, still sounds flawless, and has all the songs. The pictures are bigger too! The price of a good second-hand turntable is justified to get the whole package, so make amazon.com stock the LP, and get it. My personal CDs are copies of that same old 17 year old LP, and I'm luckier than you are. I still remember the feeling I had when I heard about D. and I still can't believe this was supposed to be an answer to Husker Du's double album, and the Minutemen didn't even need a 14 minute instrumental to pad it out. Better than EXILE ON MAIN ST., better than THE BLANTON-WEBSTER BAND, better than THE SUN SESSIONS, better than PIANO QUINTET IN F MINOR OPUS 34. It's better than ROCKET TO RUSSIA!! If you don't understand, you lose.
B000002J2B|4.0|In my opinion the truly classic era of Genesis did not end with the leaving of Gabriel, but of Hacket. And here we reach 'Wuthering', the last Hacket albumn, after which the remaining trio would pretty much loose all of its rich heritage. It is a bittersweet, melancholy albumn as indicated by its drab but interesting grey cover.<br />We start out with 'Eleventh Earl of Mar', a good old-fashioned Genesis song about the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715. (Granted, it was actually the 6th Earl of Mar, but that wouldn't fit the meter and the other historcal facts mentioned in the lyrics were basically was accurate.) It begins and ends with a chilling, eerie synthesizer that will be repeated with less-frightening effects later on in the albumn. In any case, its a strong, rhytmic song that's good but doesn't grab you like the Gabriel-era long songs.  'Eleventh Earl of Mar', like most of the albumn, employs the complex 'wall of sound' method that works to varying degrees.<br />Next we get 'One for the Vine', one of the albumn's high points, that continues along the same lines as the previous song regarding the cyclic concept regarding war.  Here we follow one anonymous man as he flees from the madness of religious fanatacism only to become the object of that fanatacism himself.  Lyrically it is simple but wonderful, and the music reinforces the cyclic concept just as it did in the previous song.  However, the music, while good, doesn't flow completely well with the lyrics, especially at the end, where an admittedly good intrumental segment draws on and takes the punch out of the crucial last few lines.  Nonetheless, the music itself is quality and the instrumental during the title scene is possibly the best moment musically on the albumn.<br />However, after a good star the quality segues.  'Your Own Special Way', alas, is the albumn's low point. It's a love song, wrtten in first person. Those two things, of course, are the antithesis of classic Genesis and the song is redeemed only by some decent keyboard work, but even that turns into what sounds like noodling.  'Wot Gorilla' is a bizarrely named, eclectic intrumental bit that, like 'One for the Vine's music, isn't bad but fails to truly grasp you. Following 'Wot Gorilla' is another eclectic piece, 'All in a Mouse's Night.' Here we continue on the classic Genesis tradition of having one comical mini-play per albumn, though, alas, it stumbles with Collin's vocals. Similar songs like 'Get 'Em Out by Friday' and 'The Battle of Epping Forest' suceeded party because Gabriel would go all-out and do a variety of comical, quirky voices for the many characters. Collin's vocals fail to be so dynamic, and thus a major part of the humor is lost in the otherwise quite witty story.<br />Thankfully, the albumn gets it into high gear with 'Blood on the Rooftops', Hacket's swan song with the band. His gacoustic uitar intro is simply wonderful, harkening back to his 'Horizons' piece on 'Foxtrot'. Then we get into Collin's vocals that work surprisingly well, and through the lyrics are distinctly English, their message about apathy to the world around us is hauntingly appropriate 25 years later. The song is, in my opinion, the albumn's overall high point and one of the best songs from Collins-era Genesis.<br />Then we move into the sonic trio. 'Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers' is a quality, soothing synthesizer-driven short that ends with the drumroll that signals 'In that Quiet Earth', a funky intrumental that, while not as good as the likes of 'After the Ordeal or 'The Brazilian', is still a good 'wall of sound' and repeats the harrowing opening notes of '11th Earl of Mar', though with less menace. Finally it all ends with 'Afterglow' a somewhat poppy first-person ballad that, unlike 'Your Own Special Way', truly works well and seems to fittingly close the albumn with a mournful tone.<br />The second half of the albumn is quality, though the first slumps after 'One for the Vine'. Nonetheless, it is a fond farewell that marks the end of Hacket and the end of Genesis's classic period, which had produced some of the best music ever heard by these ears.
B00005NB8J|4.0|This movie when I first saw it in a private screening before its domestic release. I didn't know what to expect. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised.<br />Unique story and an interest premise. The effects are very cool and the Stargate itself is an interesting concept. Kurt Russel begins the movie with his character as being a nasty guy, but then you warm up to him.<br />Jay Davis (The Crying Game) is a really starnge alien leader. I won't give much away but he is like a snake in the grass.<br />James Spader played a great &quot;nerdy&quot; scientist and the most unsuspecting leading &quot;love&quot; man. He falls in love with the alien female (played by Alexi Cruz)and ends up saving Earth and her planet too.<br />Overall the film is an action adventure but it also has heart. Dena Devling and Roland Emerich wrote this with Roland directing.<br />(This team also cretaed Godzilla and Independance Day!)<br />This is a good modern Sci-Fi film to have in your colleciton.
B000021XS0|5.0|In 1992, Dream Theater released Images and Words, the first with James Labrie and arguably the band's best. That can be said about this album. There was a fantastic song on the album named, to cite it's full title \\"Metropolis Part 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper.\\" That song was amazing. But fan speculation went ballistic over why it's a part I and if the band would write part II.The band intended as a joke but they finally cave in and wrote a very good competitor that can stand up to Images and Words. Normally I write albums track by track but since this is a concept album(and with some short songs to boot: \\"Through My Words\\" is only a minute long) I just decided to review it as a whole.<br />This is a concept album so it's based around one particular theme. In this album, it's based around a character named Nicholas who is hyptonized and finds out about Victoria and Julian, 2 lovers from 1928 who died apparently from a murder-suicide. But Nicholas suspects something a little more.<br />Each and every band member shines in this album: James Labrie's 4 different singing voices(they're the same but there' little nuances), John Petrucci's incredible guitar playing(listen to \\"Home\\", or \\"The Spirit Carries On.\\"), John Myung's great bass lines(he has a incredibly fast part on \\"The Dance of Eternity\\"), John Portnoy's great drumming(listen to the ending of \\"Finally Free\\") and finally Jordan Rudess, who can create just great sounds with keyboards(check the intro to \\"Home\\" for an almost sitar like part).<br />If you love music where you really listen, you'll love this. However, if you want songs that are about 4 minutes and have simple song arrangements, stay away from this like mad. One last note: if you can't understand the ending, try getting the live video version. If I have one gripe about the album and there isn't any, it's that there's quite a bit of musical interludes. They could've shortened some of the sections.
B00003CXCK|5.0|A graphically intense view of the horrors of war and prejudice. The human soul has its dark side and its compassionate side. There's nothing else out there that compares to this.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Just got through viewing this DVD for the 3rd time and I find new things in the movie that I missed, or overlooked, or ignored...like the huge mass of Fluffy-saliva that drools down onto poor Ron...YUCK!  I totally spaced on that part of the scene.Valdemort was more alevolent and vicious up close, also the Devil's Snare looked a lot more realistic in the DVD than the movie. Norbert's birth brought a tear to my eye, really, again, the intimacy of Harry Potter.  What can I say, it's fabulous. Gorgeous color, dense black, magnificent Dolby Surround sound track that grows on you, I swear, the more times I see the film, the more I like John Williams scoring..it was kinda fomrula in the theater, but it really is an enjoyable  set of notes. I may go out on a limb here without my Nimbus 2000 to catch me, but I think this DVD is superior to the theatrical release, because you can get up close and personal with this film.  I feel young watching it.
B000065U1N|4.0|This is an action-filled recreation of an American mission into Somalia gone bad.  The Americans were to capture a local dictator and his lieutenants, but instead one of their helicopters is shot down and things go from bad to worse as they are attacked by local soldiers.  Help is slow in coming and the Americans hold off their enemy as best they can while waiting for reinforcements.  The action is fast and furious and the acts of courage are everywhere.  This is a well-made film and is recommended for those who enjoy this genre.
B0000640VO|5.0|Missed this film somehow in the cinema. Bought the DVD because someone told me of the beginning with the fly and it's 14,000x beats per minute being squashed by a car, so I thought that can't be a bad film ;). The gnome is priceless ...<br />I won't go over the cinematography or story, the MUSIC in this film alone makes it's worth buying. Beautiful soundtrack, this always completes a great film.
B00004Y9PP|5.0|I'm not usually a big fan of the sci/horror genre, but I'll make a huge exception for this excellent film.  Action packed from the opening scene to closing credits, loaded with excellent sound and camera work, and well produced; it provides an excellent canvas for it's young actors who deliver just the right edge.  Remminisent of the best of Ridley Scotts Aliens, but unique.  It avoids the common mistakes of the genre, never being too bloody or cheesy.  One of my favorite DVD's.
6304639457|5.0|Fleetwood Mac sounds even better than they did in the 70's.  I don't think I've ever heard a live performance sound quite this good before.  All of the members, with the exception of Christine McVie, have lost a little of the high end in their voices, but it dosen't really affect the performances.  Many of the classic hits are done here, and some of them, Christine McVie's great oldie, &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; for example, are done in an unplugged version.  This effort even brought her out from behind her keyboards to sing, and play the tamborine.  Lindsey Buckingham, is one of the most underated guitarist of all time.  His playing on &quot;Big Love&quot;, and &quot;Go Insane&quot; is incrediable.  Stevie Nicks can still sing with the best of them.  She finally gets to make a hit out the never-released-on-an-album song &quot;Silver Springs&quot;.  All of the singing members of the group bring new songs to the stage as well.  McVie's &quot;Temporary One&quot;, and Buckinham's &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot;, are the best.  If you want the full performance, you'll have to buy the DVD, or VHS, of the concert.  The CD release cuts out a large number of great old songs, like the closing classic, &quot;Songbird&quot;, to be worth the purchase.  All in all, Fleetwood Mac, shows that, like the Eagles reunion, some groups really do get better with age.
B00004RF9I|5.0|That it took so long to release this movie on DVD.  I have a Beta, a VHS, and recently purchased a Laserdisc before I noticed it was available on DVD. Super DVD folks, good transfer, it's hard to beleive Dunnaway or Duval were ever that young.. ha ha.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I bought this CD because I LOVED to work out to WHENEVER and loved the powerful voice I heard on Underneath your clothes (though the lyrics don't make much sense to me).  It's quite enjoyable even if only for a few 'good' songs.  Her voice is amazing and I LOVE the heavy Spanish accent -- I find it endearing and it adds such dramatic flair and let's face it -- the lady can flat out SING, unlike Ms. Spears.  It is a shame she had to go blonde to break into the U.S. because she is much better than that would make her appear.  Also, I don't understand people saying this CD doesn't play on a PC...It is playing on my PC right now as I type this with no problems.
B0000668IF|5.0|a great album in it's own right as well as a supurb follow up to Play.  If you enjoyed Play this is an excellent cd.
B000066NW0|5.0|Well, I just want to say that the song Skater Boy has some very true lyrics.  I had passed up a &quot;skater boy&quot; myself.  And everything that Avril wrote in that song, was how I felt.
B00005JL3A|5.0|It seems no coincidence that the best Video Game series ever created also became the best Video Game Movie to date.  RE is amazing, the movie is true to its VG brothers, the environments are perfect. The creepy atmosphere, the terror of being eaten alive, the stress in trying to conserve your dwindleing supply of Ammo.  Also, to all of those who said there wasn't enough gore, Paul Anderson had to cut out some scenes to avoid a NC-17 rating, but he said that he would probably include them in the DVD. If movie buffs will remember, Romero's Living Dead movies almost had X ratings because of the gore factor.  So don't diss the movie just because some shots had to be cut for the theatrical version. RE RULES
B000002JS6|5.0|&quot;Back in Black&quot; is arguably the most important album in the history of heavy, even beating out (barely) Led Zeppelin. As a band, Led Zeppelin was important, but the didn't have an undisputed masterpiece. The highlights are the title track, which is second most important song in heavy metal (Stairway to Heaven being the first), &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long,&quot; and &quot;Hells Bells.&quot; Interestingly enough, &quot;Back in Black&quot; is featured on the trailer for Disney's Lilo &amp; Stitch. The highlight songs are known for their haunting guitar riffs, (especially the title track), Brian Johnson's screeching vocals, so who am I to argue? &quot;Back in Black&quot; is, and always will be, the single most important album in heavy metal history.
B00005A46T|5.0|I have always been lookin for a great heavymetal cd,this is it,when i heard IOWA i was amazed,realy,this cd will get u pumped,i listen to it when im angry and it realy helps.Slipknot came out with a previous album,maybe a year or two ago,if u havent already checked it out u need to.  the songs that could realy top the music charts would have to be LEFT BEHIND,HERITIC ANTHEM,and so and so on. If ur lookin for a cd that is all heavy metal and u could listen to it over and over this is it,hope my review was helpful,peace.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I am a fan of the Harry Potter books; I read them all the time, so I would say I am VERY familiar with them. The movie was disappointing to me though, it wasn't altogether that realistic, I imagined characters acting/looking different, and it was too childish and lame. Also, they left out key characters like Peeves, and key scenes that gave the story more depth and developed the characters better (not just action all of the time.) I think that Harry Potter would have been better left just as the book, to let the kids imagine their own scenery and views of the characters, and maybe a movie would be ok years after the books were published, like Lord of the Rings (which, by the way, is my favorite movie ever :) ) so as to give the books more credibility. Now people who saw the movie but have never read the books are given a false impression of Harry Potter. Also, as I said before, it is geared too much toward younger kids, which takes away from it quite a bit. It is obvious that they were trying to make as much money as possible out of it by targeting the younger kids as well. However, there were some good things- I liked most of the acting, I think that the young actors did a good job for being their first or one of their first productions and the music was well done. But I suggest watching Lord of the Rings instead!! (and reading the book, which is just as awesome as the movie.)
B000066NW0|5.0|well well...this CD is great..at first, i thought this cd was going to suck because of the vibes that i got from her...but i was very wrong. Avril Lavigne has an awesome voice. All the songs on the cd are catchy and pretty. I also give her band two thumbs up...they sound great together..i RECOMMEND this CD for sure..buy it now! take care everyone.

B00006690G|5.0|On his third commercially released album, Eminem is at his most personal... He talks about many things and people in many different ways... On the track \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" he talks to his mum. Someone who he obviously cares for, but at the same time has hate for, \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" was produced by Eminem himself and a very eerie beat is what he concocts, it goes perfect with his flow... Another one of the many 'personal' tracks on the LP is \\"White America\\" a rock influenced aggressive song taking shots at the U.S government amongst other things. Like quite a large amount of songs on this album this track has a sort of \\"rock / rap\\" feel about it.. Eminem's lyrics & flow are incredible here. \\"Business\\" is one of the few Dr. Dre produced cuts on the album, and this track wouldn't be out of place on Eminem's debut commercial album [The Slim Shady LP].. It features the return of Slim Shady the commedian, and also has Dre's best beat on the whole album. A standout track is \\"Sing For The Moment\\" this song samples the classic rock track \\"Dream On\\" by Aerosmith.. Eminem spits three of his hottest verses ever, very politcal and consciensus Hip Hop on this track right here... Another track worth mentioning is \\"Say What You Say\\" which features Dr. Dre - who also produces this song - Although I don't personally like the song, The 2 rapppers take shots at commercial Producer/Rapper/Executive Jermaine Dupri.. <BR>The album isn't very guest filled, but the rest of D12 step-up their game on \\"When The Music Stops\\" a great track about the thin-line between music and reality... New Shady Records signee and Detroit based MC Obie Trice appears on the comic \\"Drips\\" a great verse by Obie followed by an -as always- excellent verse by Slim ensue one of the my fave songs on the album...<BR>What some may find about The Eminem Show is that the production doesn't stand-out, It just plays along in the background backing up Eminem's venemous words...3 Tracks are produced by west-coast super producer Dr. Dre and the rest are produced by Eminem, with a little help from others [Mel - Man etc]...<BR>So, overall an incredible album from Eminem which is very personal and should definetly appeal to the hardcore rap fans, as well as the 11/12 year old's...<br />Final Rating: 9/10

6302517052|4.0|This film is an entertaining sci-fi/horror crossover with comedic elements. Mayhem occurs when a spaceship, containing carniverous furballs that have escaped from an intergalactic maximum security prison, land in sleepy, rural Kansas. Shooting poisonous quills from their bodies and sporting razor sharp teeth, these creatures, called &quot;Crites&quot;, are far from cuddly.<br />Hellbent on eating anyone or anything that stands in their way, these space invaders make their way to the Brown farmhouse. There, they proceed to terrorize the Brown family, and matriarch Helen Brown (Dee Wallace) spends her time shrieking in horrified desperation. Fortunately for all concerned, two bounty hunters from outerspace arrive, dressed from head to toe in brown leather and armed with what look to be telescopic bazookas. The leader of the two looks like a rock singer. The other bounty hunter cannot quite seem to make up his mind as to whom he wishes to look like. What follows on the heels of their arrival is sure to keep the viewer entertained.
B00006690G|4.0|If you want to keep hearing Eminem's hilarious lyrics and biting social commentary, get this. If you want to hear the boring, derivative Dre-produced \\"phat beats\\" of the first CD, get a Dre CD. This album is musically years ahead of all of Eminem's other work. Some of the reviewers say the lyrics are just re-hashed, to which I say \\"bull feathers\\". Sure, there's the occasional mandatory cliche-filled sex ballad, but they're still done humorously. Don't think the whole CD's about the same things as before just because you heard the first single and first couple tracks. Really, the only thing I didn't like was the skits. Ken Kaniff's appearance was nowhere near as funny as it should have been, since his skits on the first two CD's are gut-bustingly hilarious and he was missing on D-12's album. \\"The Kiss\\" is pretty funny but should have been a whole song, like \\"Kim\\". If it would have replaced the only track I skip, (Say What You Say...blah, Dre is boring even if he helped Eminem get where he is now) this would be a 5-star CD.
B000001FO4|4.0|Cinderella emerged during the &quot;Hair Band&quot; era of the 80's and became one of the best hard rock / metal bands of that era. With their bluesy attack on hard rock these guys gave us some of the best music of that era and it still holds up today.<br />The album kicks off with &quot;Bad Seamstress Blues Fallin' Apart At The Seams&quot; and kick off it does. Starting off slow and kicking in to high gear. This is an excellent bluesy rock tune that will really get your blood pumping. Next comes &quot;Gypsy Road&quot; one of the bands four hits off this disc. This is a rockin' tune from start to finish. This is followed by one of the bands biggest hits &quot;Don't Know What You Got (Til It's Gone)&quot;. This is a very clich&eacute; song title, but the song has to be one of the best metal ballads of all time. Next comes &quot;The Last Mile&quot; another excellent hard rockin' hit for the band. &quot;Second Wind&quot; follows with just as much power and sounding like it could have came off the band's first album &quot;Night Songs&quot;.<br />&quot;Long Cold Winter&quot; is a slower tune with a very cool bluesy guitar intro. This tune is perfect for the live setting. It went over great when I saw them on this tour back in 1988. Next comes the hard driving and catchy &quot;If You Don't like It&quot; which is another excellent song. The final radio and video hit off the disc &quot;Coming Home&quot; is next in line. Starting off with a slower acoustic guitar and Tom singing, It kicks in to a more midtempo rocker. The final two cuts &quot;Fire And Ice&quot; and &quot;Take Me Back&quot; close out the disc in rockin' fashion. &quot;Take Me Back&quot; has a very catchy chorus that sticks with you.<br />There is not a bad cut on this disc. The band shines on this sophomore effort which for me is probably their best album along with &quot;Night Songs&quot;. It has it all! Full blown rockers, an amazing ballad, and everything in between. All done in a bluesy style with balls.

B00004XONN|4.0|Radiohead, considering their long-standing reputation as the forerunners of new eras in rock, have released an album that lives up to expectations, which is both a good and bad thing.  KID A is certainly pretentious and murky, with messages and lyrics seemingly obscured deliberately to conceal meaning. The first track, \\"Everything in It's Right Place,\\" is textually amazing, but YOU try chewing on the sentiment, \\"Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon.\\"<BR>   The CD grows on you, but, as several others have noted, many will not have the patience to let it. That could be a shame. I can't really tell. The CD has certainly kept me company, and there are times when I can appreciate what Thom & co. are doing on a purely intellectual level, but I can't say with 100% honesty that it has brought me any kind of pleasure.<BR>   Though it's probably unfair to compare KID A to OK COMPUTER (since they're so different), I would say that none of these tracks match up to those in the groups heyday (\\"Karma Police\\", \\"Airbag\\", \\"Exit Music\\", or even \\"Creep\\" and \\"Planet Telex\\"). Lyrically, it's the same old themes about paranoia ,loneliness, and the effect of technology on society, but filtered through metaphors and voice distortion until the CD almost requires a college course in and of itself to figure out what they're getting at. Some songs are decodable (\\"Morning Bell,\\" for instance, is about divorce), but overall most of the songs sound as clear as mud.<BR>   I'm giving the album 4 stars. Why? Because so few groups approach me on an intellectual level and make me work at the listening experience (even fewer groups move me emotionally; RADIOHEAD TAKE NOTE!) And because, through all the smoke and mirrors, there were times when I had a glimpse of a song I might enjoy listening to repeatedly, albeit without the window dressing.
B000063K2W|5.0|Although this movie hasn't been released on DVD yet, I have it in VHS. Can't wait for the release on DVD. I have loved this movie for years. Watch it AGAIN every once in a while when I need a good laugh & just want to \\"get away\\" for a while. ALL performances are terrific & the story is great. I agree with a previous reviewer that I don't understand either why Roz Russell didn't get the acknowledgement she deserved. I am also waiting impatiently for the release of Auntie Mame on DVD. Any doubts about The Women should be forgotten. Buy it!
B000005HLV|5.0|This isn't the best Mayhem cd, I would call their 2000 cd Grand Declaration  Of War their greatest. But this is necessary listening for all metal fans.
B00005AFLV|5.0|In 1970 keyboard player Keith Emerson of Nice and Greg Lake of King Crimson bolted from their groups and joined with drummer Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster to form the most successful power trio in the history of progressive rock. Only Renaissance could be said to have more explicitly incorporated classical music into its sound that Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. The trio were regarded as technical virtuosos on their instruments, to such a point that their performances surely could not match their reputations. Lake might not be as great a guitarist as the other two were on their instruments, but when I was a lad if you had given me my choice of any one's voice in rock and roll, I would have wanted to sing like Greg Lake (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer also have some of the more interesting &quot;what ifs&quot; around in terms of their origin, since there were rumors of Jimi Hendrix joining the group and Steve Howe of Yes actually auditioned).<br />The self-tilted 1971 debut album (mostly recorded the previous year), is a mix of the bombastic synthesizer overkill that could dominate some of their early work (such as the first side of their next album, &quot;Tarkus&quot;) and the subtle balance between Lake's vocals and Emerson's piano playing. The former is represented by the instrumental opening track, &quot;The Barbarian,&quot; which sets up a radical shift to the former with &quot;Take a Pebble.&quot; This song was ELP's first released single, and would become one of the improvisational standards of the group in concert. The &quot;first side&quot; ends with &quot;Knife-Edge,&quot; based on a theme by Janacek I believe, and is one of the rare examples of balance between Emerson's synthesizer and Lake's vocals. You have to remember that the synthesizer was a new toy at that time and perhaps Emerson should be forgiven for taking it out so relentlessly at times on a test drive.<br />&quot;The Three Fates,&quot; like &quot;Take a Pebble,&quot; owes much to classical forms and provides ample evidence of my contention that Emerson was much more proficient on a piano than on an organ. &quot;Tank&quot; represents the third synthesized work while &quot;Lucky Man,&quot; the group's first and biggest hit single, showcases Lake's haunting vocals against an acoustic guitar, with a synthesizer solo at the end. You cannot help but wonder what else Greg lake might have written if he did not have to contend with Emerson's propensity to longer and longer keyboard works. Any how, on Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's debut album we end up with three synthesizer songs and three piano/guitar songs and whichever type you prefer, it is going to dictate which of their other albums you are going to enjoy.d provides ample evidence of my contention that Emerson was much more proficient on a piano than on an organ. &quot;Tank&quot; represents the third synthesized work while &quot;Lucky Man,&quot; the group's first and biggest hit single, showcases Lake's haunting vocals against an acoustic guitar, with a synthesizer solo at the end.

B000003N89|5.0|Recently I discovered Diana Krall from a friend that ownes a music store. I was traveling on the road and wanted to buy a CD that would be relaxing. He set me onto Diana, and I have not turned back. This album &quot;All For You&quot; is my third album by Diana and I plan to get the rest of her recording in the near future. I highly recommend her performances. As a drumer and music educator I find this album (and all her albums) to be rich with musical feeling and of high quality performance. Go out and get this album....you wil not regret it!
B000002H2H|5.0|This is about the best heavy metal album you could own! Riffs are amazing vocals amazing solos amazing drumming amazing!U get the picture! Songs like creeping death and fight fire with fire just make you wanna get up and thrash away at your guitar for hours on end!<br />                keep em coming tallica boys!
B00005JL3A|2.0|It bothers me to see that almost all adaptions of Video Games to the screen focus entirely on special effects and not on plot.  Unfortunately Resident Evil is not the exception.  The zombie gore and grosseness is all there is to focus on in the film so the viewer is left waiting for the credits to roll.  There is no balance between the plot and the action.  Leaving this film lacking and boring.
B00003CXA6|4.0|I agree with most all other reviewers regarding the movie itself.<BR>Martin Sheen would not have been my choice for playing R.E. Lee, he seemed extremely uncomfortable during horseriding scenes-R.E. Lee was an excellent horseman. His performance was wooden at times.  This part just didn't seem right for him. <br />My problem is the 5.0 sound, instead of 5.1. Although the channel separation is very good, an updated dts/digital dolby version would add even more realism to the battle scenes. Deleted scenes, added in a recent TV presentation, would also improve the movie.  Here's hoping to a re-release.
B000002IST|5.0|This is another of my favorites. There isn't a bad song on here. The songs have meaning -- the lyrics may be simple and accessible, but they never slip into silliness. No Son of Mine is one of the best songs about child abuse I've heard, although it's very different, it's as good as Suzanne Vega's Luka. The drum beat is absolutely piercing. Everything comes together in this song; it's a perfect marriage of band and song. The rest of the album of the album is equally high in calibre. The songs tell stories, and the listener gets caught right up in the tale. <BR>Other highlights are Driving The Last Spike and Dreaming While You Sleep, which still gives me chills. <br />I won't pretend the album is flawless; it isn't. Jesus He Knows Me, while very creative and humourous, can get on the listener's nerves after a few listens. I Can't Dance isn't great, either, and Hold On My Heart was vastly overplayed on the radio.<br />Despite the few things that I don't love, I still think this is a great album by one of the best bands of all time.
0807208523|5.0|My mother read this book to me when I was 9 or 10 years old.  Its a great story, but it caused me alot of grief. I still remember crying in bed for many nights after we finished the book.  You grow to love these characters so much.<br />Its a great childrens book, but if you have an extremely sensitive/tender-hearted child, or if you are one, watch out.
0698119347|5.0|I thought this book was incredible! It had a good pace for the first forty or so pages, then it took off, and didn't look back. This is possibly the best book I've ever read. I can't wait to read the sequel!
1563890119|3.0|What happens when a group of mystics ensnare the King of Dreams and keep him imprisoned for over seventy years? <BR>So begins Neil Gaiman's epic, sweeping vision that constitutes the Sandman series. The first book concerns itself with Morpheus's eventual escape and quest to find the accoutrements with which he used to rule his dream kingdom. This is no ordinary comic series; Gaiman brilliantly exploits the sequential art medium to provide us with provocative- and often disturbing- images that underline the thrust of the words. \\"24 Hours,\\" for example, just wouldn't be the same if it was produced as your normal, everyday novel. Actually seeing, in Dr. Dee's eyes, the products of his warped fantasies in graphic form adds a layer to the narrative Gaiman wouldn't ordinarily have. And these are visual characters; Morpheus and the celebrated Death, with their Gothic, ultra cool look are so easily identifiable and indelibly imprint themselves in the reader's mind. Their visual representation also reinforces their uniqueness; Death's Ankh talisman, for example, perfectly enscapulates the paradoxical nature of the wearer, where death is a positive, life-affirming state.    <BR>Notwithstanding the consistent high quality quality of the art (I especially love that astounding, two-page image in \\"A Hope in Hell,\\" where Dream, Lucifer, Azazel and Beezelbub stand atop a summit overlooking all of Hell's denizens, and Lucifer, with the slightest touch of humour, asks Morpheus if he can pick out the creature that stole his helm) and some very good stories(\\"24 Hours\\" and \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\"), I can't help but get the impression that, as a whole, _Preludes_ is a forced effort. As Gaiman himself later acknowledged, and many are quick to critique, Gaiman's attempts at intertextuality fall flat. The bringing in of characters from other storylines (Cain and Abel, John Constantine, Scott Free, J'onn, etc.) gives the narrative a campy, tawdry look. It's a ridiculous marketing ploy thatreally robs the narrative of its uniqueness. Gaiman is at his best when the tenor of _Sandman_ matches that of its protagonist; dark, brooding, enigmatic. To Gaiman's credit, this \\"failed experiment\\" never went beyond _Preludes_ and helps to explain why subsequent titles are so much better than this one. <BR>I think that it's necessary to start with this title, however. The summary of _Preludes_ at the beginning of _The Doll's House_ robs the reader of some important contextualizations and impressions that can only be made by actually reading the book. Despite its faults, _Preludes_ is better than 95% of graphic novels and comic books out there. And it only gets better....
B000068TPN|3.0|We Were Soldiers' main flaw is that it has the tendency to get a little too dramatically overdone.  Some of the characters aren't as well developed as the movie would like us to think, and after a while, it gets pretty obvious who's going to live and who doesn't (surprising, considering this was based on actual events).  Gibson, while delivering a terrific performance, plays Hal Moore as nothing short of a god among men, which gets a little annoying.  But otherwise, this is a pretty decent anti-war film.  <br />Ever since Saving Private Ryan, war films have focused on graphically violent battle scenes, and We Were Soldiers is among the bloodiest.  The combat scenes are well-choreographed and frenetic, though director Randall Wallace is still no Spielberg or Ridley Scott. Because of the bright color scheme Wallace uses, the flowing blood can be seen clearly throughout the whole film, and let's just say if you thought Black Hawk Down was too much to stomach, you should probably stay away from We Were Soldiers (especially the helicopter finale, I don't believe I've ever seen a war movie spill that much blood in a short amount of time)because it's even more graphic.  <br />We Were Soldier's main theme, that soldiers fight for their friends and the men next to them, is delivered in a fashion that's just too far overdone, Black Hawk Down did a better job with the same message.  Still, in the pantheon of Vietnam war flicks, We Were Soldiers, while weaker than Platoon, still comes out above Full Metal Jacket and pretty much any other combat film set in that era.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you are tired of the typical american musicals, you should try and watch Moulin Rouge.It might make you change your mind completely!This colourful film directed by Baz Lhurman tells a story about love, about a shy british writer Christian, who happens to walk into the Moulin Rouge.There, he meets the \\"Sparkling Diamond\\",the courtesane Satine.They begin an impossible affair, which was not ment to be...<br />Many people believe this is an unreal film, with a very predictable plot but I don´t think that´s the point.The film doesn´t either want to show Paris at its late 1990s but simply takes place in an imaginary world similar to it.When you finish watching the film it feels like leaving a dream from which you wouldn´t like to wake up from.(!!!)<br />The choreography, music, costumes,make-up and sets are really good.In addition,the cast is great:Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman are brilliant and have surprised me by their singing-although their voices aren´t amazing, they´re nice to listen to-he is extremly charimatic,cute and perfect as the shy, inexpert Christian.And Nicole...as good as usual!Finally, John Leguizamo is ideal for his paper as Toulouse:irritating tweety-bird speech.Moulin Rouge is different from other musicals, but nevertheless spectacular!
B000063S6Z|4.0|While it is probably true that Play is still Moby's greatest album to date, I would strongly disagree with anybody who criticized the man's latest CD, 18.<br />Overall, 18 is probably the music I choose most often to work, drive, or rest with. It is not nearly as rambunctious as Play was, keeping a consistently mellow and brooding mood throughout. Most of the pieces are pretty similar, generally falling in the same genre and basic musical construction.<br />Here's a break-down of the first half of the album:<br />1) &quot;We are all made of stars&quot;: I would agree with those that have drawn similarities between this song and &quot;Southside&quot; from Play. It has a sort of Pop/60s feel to it with a mix of acoustic drums, electric guitar and some synth instruments.<BR>2) &quot;In This World&quot;: this song sets the bar for in terms of genre for the CD. In This World is basically a combination of the characteristically Moby electronic drums/strings and blues/gospel vocals. If anything, this song is very similar to Natural Blues from Play.<BR>3) &quot;In My Heart&quot;: basically exactly the same type of music as the previous song with new vocals and a different melody.<BR>4) &quot;The Great Escape&quot;: Quite possibly the worst production by Moby EVER. I frankly don't know how or why Moby put this on 18 in the first place. It consists of nothing but some strings and Azure Ray singing. It wouldn't be so bad if the strings weren't totally synthesized-sounding, creating a very artificial and choppy sound that doesn't fit the vocals at all. The only reason not to buy this CD is so that you don't have to hear the opening notes of this piece before frantically hitting the &quot;next&quot; button. However, bad as it is, The Great Escape is not enough of a malady to ruin the CD. Go out and get it anyway!<BR>5) &quot;Signs of Love&quot;: I really like this song. It's not something that bursts out at you. I just had the cd playing one day and realized that I was mouthingthe lyrics. There isn't alot to say about this track, you just kind of have to hear it. It incorporates acoustic drums, strings, synth, bass, electric guitar and male vocals.<BR>6) &quot;One of these mornings&quot;: This is one of the first tracks on 18 to show a clear hip-hop influence. Backed up by a hip-hop basic beat, a woman sings leaving. You also have your standard strings/bass/etc. This is a very bluesy/gospel track.<BR>7) &quot;Another Woman&quot;: There is a clear afro-american influence in this piece. A very spiritual/gospel vocal is combined with mixed afro/latin percussion and and 4-note jazz bass.<BR>8) &quot;Fireworks&quot;: Must be figurative for something...cause this is no firestarter. This piece is very relaxing, mixing piano, acoustic guitar, and slow drums. It sounds exactly like something off of the Chrono Cross soundtrack.<BR>9) &quot;Extreme Ways&quot;: is probably my favorite piece on the album. This piece is a total potpourri of different musical styles. On one hand you have orchestral strings, and on the other you have a deep-bass hip-hop beat. Great song!<BR>10) &quot;Jam for the Ladies: One of the more controvertial songs on the album. Personally I like it alot. Others disagree. This is bassically the Body Rock of Moby's new album. It's a combination of rap and r&amp;b. Listen to the sample...see what you think.<br />18 is predominantly blues and gospel, with hip-hop and rock/pop mixed in there somewhere. A great buy if you liked Moby's previous stuff.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|I was living in England when this series came out (so to speak), and I simply loved it. When I learned of the American version, I was excited, but after intital viewings, felt it to be a disappointment.  Perhaps because I spent time in England, the British version is much better in my eyes. I prefer the Brit actors, and the manner of storytelling, which is less.. uh.. Americanish.  I find the British Vince character to be adorable, while his US counterpart is, at best, a bit irritating. For an anglophile and/or fans of British movies and films, this is sure to please.
B000066NW0|4.0|I'm always skeptic of albums put out by teens, mostly because they usually lack the maturity musically to make really good tunes. Avril should get some credit. This is much better than most. The first single &quot;Complicated&quot; is probably what you heard to look at this album but I won't be surprised if &quot;Losing Grip&quot; makes a good single as well. I think I'll be following Avril's career more closely after listening to these songs.<br />You should like this album if you're into artists like Michelle Branch, Lisa Loeb, Alanis Morissette or (maybe) Vanessa Carlton.
B00003CXI1|5.0|and faithful to the book. For those that haven't read the book, the movie is complete and self-explainatory and you probably won't feel \\"lost\\". The extra game you have to navigate in order to see the deleted scenes is a bit of a pain, however. Once suffered through, the scenes are worth the trouble but it would have been nice to have the option of merely viewing the scenes alone.
B000067DNC|3.0|I imported the DVDs from England about a year ago. Why are they only just becoming available on this side of the pond now? <BR>Regretfully the DVDs are just copies of the shows. Granted GREAT COPIES: Clear, powerful sound; beautiful, sharp colors and focus. <BR>And a couple of short inteviews witrh SG-1. WW!  <BR>MGM could have done so much more with these multimedia rich stories. And it only took them 6 years to bring to market!<BR>Still, I'll buy every one, but I'll never stop bitching.
B000058T5E|5.0|...and this album proves it. You Had It Coming is one of Jeff Beck's finest works. Jeff Beck is the best guitar player ever, his mastery of his beloved Stratocaster never ceases to amaze me. This album is filled with Beck phrases, Beck ideas, and Beck tones. Jeff's guitar tone is really amazing. I saw him live on the YHIC tour, and the tone is was even more amazing there. The fact that Jeff can pull this off live is even more astounding than the album itself. <BR> <BR>Back to the album. In Guitar Player (December 2000), Jeff was on the cover for You Had It Coming. The article, written by Matt Blackett, states that, &quot;it...features some of his most breathtakingly emotional playing ever.&quot; And it does. Songs such as &quot;Nadia&quot; and &quot;Suspension&quot; are covered with emotion. You can feel it in every note. And of course, no Beck album would be complete with crazy, space like ideas. &quot;Loose Cannon,&quot; &quot;Roy's Toy,&quot; and &quot;Left Hook&quot; show this, and they rock. &quot;Rollin' and Tumblin&quot; is also a pleasant surprise.  <BR> <BR>Nadia, however, is the standout of the album. When you listen to it, you wonder &quot;how on earth did he do that?&quot; The answer: he's Jeff Beck. Nadia is astounding and beautiful. Suspension is also worth mention here. It is indeed mysterious and beautiful, ending when you want more. Earthquake is the perfect opening to the album, and, quite frankly, it rocks. Dirty Mind features some nice wah pedal work and has a nice solo. Loose Cannon really allows Jeff to open up, and has a great solo in it as well.  <BR> <BR>With the psychotic blues riffs, sheer emotion and excellent back beats, You Had It Coming is an album that has Jeff Beck shine. It is on par with Blow by Blow, Wired, and Guitar Shop as not only Jeff Beck's greatest, but music's greatest. Buy it.
B000000OUJ|5.0|While every Wu-Tang solo release is noteworthy for one reason or another, this flawless solo LP from GZA is of special note because, to my ears, it captures The RZA at a creative peak, soundwise. These tracks are truly atmospheric and deep, and there are, thankfully, no outside contributions, every track here is pure RZA. While Inspectah Deck has a great guest shot on my favorite track, \\"Cold World\\" (can't you just listen to this song 1,000 times?) this is entirely GZA's showcase and his intricate, brilliant wordplay, while somewhat measured in places, is stunning from start to finish. There is no filler here and the album doesn't overstay it's welcome, it's simply perfect. A hip-hop classic.
038533348X|5.0|If you have never read any of the author's book, then you know what I mean by the title.  He goes outside of normal day writing to explore the world that makes you think.  Nonetheless, he is a great writer at the very least.  I am not a science fiction type of guy besides Ender's Game one of the greatest books, but I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  I am an engineer so reading is not my passion, but for a good read, try this out.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Wow!..... If you love Diana Krall, she absolutely delights on The Look Of Love.   Also check out &quot;Gary Clark/Piano&quot;, and &quot;Josh Groban&quot;! These 3 artists are the best Ive heard this year!
B00005JKLZ|4.0|This was a tough one for me!I grew up with the original \\"Time Machine\\" as a young boy and I absolutely loved it!!!I still have the Dell Movie Classic comic book and was fortunate enough to meet George Pal and have a nice letter from him from the 60's.I was so excited about the remake when I heard about it and always worried about the comparisons that would be made about each of them.I think the special effects were awesome and I truly loved the \\"new\\" Time Machine itself.I liked the premise of the movie and I thought the Morlocks were great but there was just something weak about the movie itself.I guess I just have to love it anyway because it still feels like a part of the original.I wish they had had Rod Taylor in some kind of cameo.I missed Alan Young's part because my eyes never left the girl outside.I will buy the DVD when it comes out because I want to watch it a few more times to look at things again and just to have it in my collection.I'm sure it will always have a sentimental place in my heart!
B000001Y42|5.0|I got this cd back in 98 i think, and it was the best cd i had. I waited for a year, and the next Limp came out. It wasn't nearly as good as this one but its still alright, then another year - Chocolate Starfish. that one is awful. If Limp Bizkit either stayed the same or broke up after this album, they would be so much better. Every song on this cd is good, including the 16 minute Everything. Heres what I think of the songs:<br />1. Intro (1/5) - It's just an intro, nothing special.<br />2. Pollution (5/5) - Awesome. One of their best songs. This song is pretty hard compared to there others.<br />3. Counterfeit (4/5) - This the first Limp Bizkit song i heard. This song has some of there metal roots, and has a pretty good meaning. One of there best.<br />4. Stuck (4/5) - Very Good song. Has a decent tune, but the lyrics could get better.<br />5. Nobody Loves Me (3/5) - Sort of gets boring, but its still better than there new stuff.<br />6. Sour (4/5) - Weird tune. This is the third song i heard from them. It has a pretty funny meaning to it.<br />7. Stalemate (3/5) - Can get boring also. It's not really that hard, but still a great song.<br />8. Clunk (5/5) - Great. Has a great tune, and the lyrics actaully mean something. One of the bests on the cd.<br />9. Faith (2/5) - I don't really like this song, but it seems that everyone else does. this is the second song i heard from this band.<br />10. Stinkfinger (5/5) - Great Song. Everything is good, music which is pretty hard, Lyrics, everything.<br />11. Indigo Flow (4/5) - This is a dedication song.It has an awsome tune to it.<br />12. Leech (10/5) - Best song on the album. Its hard, good lyrics, and it sticks in ur head. its just a little short.<br />13. Everything (2/5) - Probably worst song due to the fact that its almost 17 minutes. They could do without this song.<br />Hope this helped ya. Cya!
B00004Z4WR|4.0|...and here's why! While Cage is, in my mind at least, fairly decent at romantic comedy (a genre I love), \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" proves that he can carry off action roles with a certain surpising panache. From the moment Cage's character flicks his collar \\"Fonz-style\\" in front of a full-length mirror and says (in his trademark low/long/quiet voice), \\"I'm a baaaaad man,\\" you know you are in for some great moments.<br />I'm usually not a fan of action flicks. So when a friend suggested I watch this, I was expecting the usual high-octane, blow-something-up-and-drive-away-at-eighty-MPH-laughing-your-head-off fare. But \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" is... well... a little different. Cage plays Randall \\"Memphis\\" Raines, a car thief gone straight, who is forced to return to his life of crime when his brother, Kip runs afoul of a local gang boss. Raines' choice is simple: Return to his old life for one last job, or watch his brother get squished to death in a car crusher. No-brainer right? The catch? The job looks impossible -- steal 50 rare classic luxury cars and drive them all onto a tanker, and do it before the ship sails in 72 hours! Forced to choose between certain death for the brother he gave up the passion of his life to protect, and doing the impossible Cage makes the Hollywood-obvious choice and accepts the challenge, enlisting the help of his brother's car-thief cronies, and his old crew (which include both Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall).<br />This movie, action aside, is essentially about the question, \\"To what lengths will you go for family?\\" And Cage, while expertly playing the cool, hard-bitten thief on the outside, manages to show us the warmth, and depth of dedication Memphis really holds for his brother. As such, \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" while being chock full of heart-pounding, demolition-derby thrills, is at the same time a very thought-provoking film. Although not recommended for the younger set (Parents, if you must let your 0-10 year-olds watch this DVD, do yourselves a favor: watch it with them, and skip track 21.) it is an extremely well-done film. To everyone disappointed with the quality of this film (and there have been many) I say, \\"Watch it again. You didn't look closely enough.\\"<br />So, does Memphis pull it off? You'll have to buy it and see.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is without a shadow of a doubt the best thrash album ever recorded. The songs are awesome and have very intelligent lyrics and powerful music. The solos Kirk Hammett pull off are lightning-fast and executed with great skill. I have never heard anything like this album in my life and I doubt I ever will. There is nothing around that even stands a chance against Master of Puppets. It is an epic record that every metal fan should own. More bands should take influence from this than from bands like Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Kid Rock. The best songs on the album are Master of Puppets, Orion, The Thing That Should Not Be, and Welcome Home (Sanitarium).
051788710X|5.0|Industrialized people such as ourselves are people who have inherited a profoundly distubing situation that has two faces: one is the destruction of our environment, the other are our atrophied spiritual senses, what I call our Otherworldly senses. Moss' book breathes new fire into our situation, calling on us to re-enliven a dreaming culture every bit as in tune with our souls and the living earth as the Australian culture that influenced him in his younger days, and the Scottish-Celtic druidic culture that shaped his ancestors. The problem with some of the other reviews I have read of this book are two-fold: instant, jaded disbelief, and what seems to be a lack of follow through on a pivotal point that Robert makes time and again: that success with active dreaming requires an active dreaming practice.  Practice. The book Conscious Dreaming is a profound introduction (or shall I say, reintroduction) of an ancient way of relating to our dreams and ways for apprehending a greater fluency with non-ordinary reality.  Anyone interested in dreams or incorporating a more shamanically-based dreaming practice into your life should consider CONSCIOUS DREAMING part of your required reading.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Ok, this is a good album.  there are a lot of really good songs on here, such as &quot;Another brick in the wall pt 2&quot;, &quot;Wish you were here&quot;, &quot;Us and them&quot;, &quot;When the Tigers broke free&quot;, and &quot;comfortably numb&quot;.  It just seems like the producers kind of forgot about &quot;dark side of the moon&quot;.  &quot;Brain damage&quot;, one of pink floyd's biggest hits, is not on here!  If youre worried about fitting it on the disk, &quot;Bike&quot; would be a good trade off
B00005JLEX|5.0|I'm dying over here!!  I still enjoy watching Seinfeld almost every night.  I would love for the entire 9 seasons to be released on DVD.  Hopefull someone who's in charge will make it happen.  There's a lot of money to be made!  That should get their attention.  I love the show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is a wonderful variation from the typical modern chick flick. The music is beyond compare. Performances by Richard &quot;The Duke&quot; and Ewan &quot;Christian&quot; are remarkable. Nicole &quot;Satine&quot; is incredibly beautiful. The characters that Baz builds throughout the duration of the movie are extremely intense. The more you watch it, the more addicted you'll become. Ewan McGregor forever!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I devoured the first four &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books--even driving over to a friend's house to borrow #4 when I couldn't find a place to buy a copy at 9 p.m., when I finished #3.<br />&quot;Not as good as the book&quot; is such a cliche that, of course, I didn't expect the movie to be as good as the books.  I was pleasantly surprised--until the end of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; movie.  We'll get to that in a moment.<br />The look of the movie is just what I thought Hogwarts and Harry's world would look like.  I love the cupboard under the stairs.  I love the owl mail.  I loved the Great Hall's ceiling change, and the different holiday decorations floating above the students' heads.  The Quiddich match was fun to watch.  Diagon Alley was more than I could take in.  Watching the chocolate frogs jump around was a nice surprise.  Wow!<br />On reflection, the depth of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series comes in the later books, as Harry learns more about his parents, and the one whose name we shall not utter.  The fun of the first book was the how Rowling created Harry's world.  So in that sense, I think that the movie works well in recreating that world.  After the previews came out, I read criticism that the movie did not appear &quot;dark&quot; enough, that Hogwarts appears to fresh and clean.  Granted, the Quiddich scenes and the broom-riding lesson scene take place under bright sunny skies, but the interior scenes seem gothic enough to satisfy those wanting a darker look.<br />The young actors chosen to play the three leads--Harry, Ron and Hermione--have a great chemistry.  I hope that they will continue through the remaining movies.<br />While I loved the movie, I do have a few criticisms.  First of all, where was the Potions Room?  Everyone I know who both read the book and saw the movie was disappointed that this room was left out.  For those few who have done neither, I will back up a bit and explain.  In &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,&quot;Harry, Ron and Hermione gradually put together that a mysterious package that Hagrid the Giant picks up at Gringotts Bank, a break-in at Gringotts, the warnings about staying off the third floor, and other incidents all seem to be related.  Thus, as the novelty of Harry discovering the world of wizardry wears off, the movie delves more into this mystery.<br />Ultimately, the trio decide they need to try to get past the various magical barriers to protect the Sorcerer's Stone.  One of the strengths of the book was that this process involved critical talents of all three friends--Ron's chess playing, Hermione's riddle solving, and Harry, well, that would be giving away too much.  Hermione's key contribution comes in the Potions Room, where she and Harry have to select from among several drinks--some poison--in order to advance closer to the Sorcerer's Stone.  In the movie, however, Hermione merely recognizes the plant in which they are entangled--thanks to her overzealous studying--and explains what to do to get through.  The scene merely enforces her being a &quot;know-it-all.&quot;<br />My other criticism is that, for all its wonderful &quot;eye candy&quot; qualities, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; seems to lack the warmth of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot;  Perhaps had these two movies not premiered so close together, the comparison would not so immediately come to mind.  Both deal with fantasy worlds in which magical creates and an unexpected, seemingly unpowerful hero emerge.  Of the two, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; shines as a classic that no doubt will stand the test of time.  As for &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; let's hope that the sequels develop the depth that of the subsequent books.
B000002UZ1|5.0|This was one of the first Beatles CDs that I bought, now I still sometimes listen to it. The songs on it are great and if you are a new Beatles fan and want to hear just their hits from what I think was the best period for the Beatles (they got better as they got older) definitely buy this. Heck! It's a lot easier to pull out one album and listen to it then have find quite a few albums.
B00005RIKD|5.0|Involving, intimate, lively, vibrant, surprising...<BR>Some of the words that come to my mind when trying to describe the experience of listening to this CD. I've always been quite impartial to Sting's music, but this dics really shines. <BR>If you have the gear to bring it out, do yourself a favour and you're in for a thrilling 65+ minutes.
B000002UB6|5.0|This album is purely fantastic! 'Two of Us' has to be one of my all time favorite songs by the Beatles. It tells the story of the early parts of Paul and Linda's relashionship. Even though John dubbed 'Dig a Pony' &quot;(just) another peice of garbage&quot; it's really is a great song, too. I think George wrote his best song with the Beatles on this album, 'For you Blue', just a great love song for his wife Pattie (who he later divorced). The album also shows the end of the Beatles, as in 'Let it Be' and 'The Long and Winding Road'. To anyone who's thinking of buying a good Beatles album: this is for you.
0790729725|5.0|This is absolutly one of the best films that I have ever seen, and it is also one of my favorites. Every performance in this film is flawless. This film is perfect. One of the best gangster movies ever made! Martin Scorsese is a great director!<br />This film is a must-see, but is not for everyone. This film contains raw language, graphic violence, and drug use.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is the last Beatles album and also one of their best ones. 'Come Together' is a very interesting song. Originally John wrote it as a campaign song for marijuana-inventer Timothy Leary. He wanted to run for governer of California, but was instead arrested for drug use. 'Come Together' then became a big hit for the Beatles. 'Something' is one of George's best songs with the Beatles and interstingly enough, he says that he did not write it for Pattie. 'Octopus's Garden' is one of only two songs ever written by Ringo and it shows his love of children. Most of the songs on this album are just as good as the ones I have listed here. It was very sad that the Beatles had to break up, but all of the Beatles (well, at lest John, Paul, and George) had good careers after the Beatles.
0767830520|5.0|This is the film that made DeNiro and Scorsese famous! It is an interesting and captivating look at a lonely taxi driver, who hates New York, and all of the \\"scum\\" that surrounds him. He eventually decends into madness, all the while trying to save a young prostitute from her sleazy pimp boyfriend. Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel also give wonderful performances. Martin Scorsese has a cameo, also. Another thing: the music score by Bernard Herrmann is also a plus. It was the very last score that he ever wrote.<br />See it!
B000002UAO|5.0|There are two things that \\"a music fan\\" is right about. 1: This is a five star album and 2: this was the album where the Beatles made their transition from silly to sophisticated. But, mr. music fan: the lyrics for \\"Drive My Car\\" are not, as you say \\"three minute mindless pop songs\\". As it says in 'A Hard Day's Write', The line in \\"Drive My Car\\": \\"'Well What do you want to be'-- suggest[s] sexual favours in return for promises of career advancement\\". I do agree that the lines for 'Think for Yourself', though, might be silly.<br />This album was the first by the Beatles in which they seriously experimented with drugs (pot, etc.) and this might have added to the power of their lyrics. For instance the Beatles first made loops on tapes with the help of drugs. I think this album was a very important album for the Beatles in many ways and not all the lyrics were just \\"mindless\\".
B000063S6Z|5.0|\\"18\\" new songs by Moby and it's about an equal match for his previous \\"Play\\" release - and that's a good thing.<br /><br />The first hit, \\"We Are Made Of Stars\\" is very close to Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" with the guitar work and the repititious vocal arrangements (Bowie and Moby are buddies). \\"In This World\\" is close to \\"Play\\"'s, \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad\\" with superb vocals by guest Jennifer Price who seems to be singing through the spirit of Janis Joplin. Shauna and Lorraine Phillips check in with their sound bytes on \\"Rafters\\", both continuing Moby's white soulfulness.<br /><br />\\"One Of These Mornings\\" brings on another great soul-filled, multi-layered song with Dianne McCaulley on vocals - a nice mood piece. For those still in need of a Moby instrumental ambient piece, there's the short \\"Fireworks\\" and the somber Vangelis-like title track \\"18\\". Need a little rap? Try \\"Jam For The Ladies\\". Looking for Motown? Moby covers that as well with \\"Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)\\" with Sylvia Robinson bringing in a Billie Holiday sound-alike.<br /><br />The entire album benefits from all the guest vocalists who seem to understand Moby's direction, but then, he uses most of their talent in precorded snippets - and that's fine.<br /><br />\\"Im Not Worried At All\\" finishes off the album with a great Gospel rendition by The Shining Light Gospel Choir.<br /><br />Moby has managed to match his previous work with another collection of satifying works. This is a album worth repeated listenings.
B000007491|5.0|I discovered Supertramp with the The Very Best of Supertramp CD, and in my opinion they've written some of the finest and most exciting progressive rock ever. They've also done their share of dull and boring tunes, which I noticed as soon as I started collecting their other albums. This first one, however, is a real gem. &quot;Try Again&quot; is one the best songs I've ever heard. Incredible.
B00003CXRP|3.0|Picture a young school-kid who has made a model of Camelot using wood and styrofoam. Picture the child as he or she happily walks to school, proud to turn his/her work into their history class for the eventual top grade. Now watch as fate intervenes as the child trips on an uneven curb, sending the model crashing to the ground. The child cries and sobs...and then looks up to see the model is still VERY much intact. The only thing the child DIDN'T super-glue to death were the little action-figurines used to portray the inhabitants of Camelot...and a tip of Arthur's tower is slightly wrecked.<br />It's fixable...but why go to the trouble when 99 percent of the project is very much okay and ready to present and will knock the socks off of all the other kids who used a simple shoebox to present the Round Table room???<br />This is the case for director Robert Zemeckis. Even though he sometimes stumbles, his stuff is still fun to watch. And it's because of beautiful special effects a very real(and VERY Oscar-worthy) performance by the ever-dynamic Tom Hanks, and a(mostly) smart script.<br />CASTAWAY is the story of Chuck Noland(Hanks), a systems-engineer for the FedEx company(methinks FedEx had to be paid a TON to both sponsor the film and portray one of their delivery jets crashing and losing thousands of packages). He's obssessed with time and things going the way they're supposed to. His relationship is what it is: Chuck and his girlfriend, Kelly(the overrated Helen Hunt in an understated performance) see each other in short bursts but are very happy with the agreement they have and actually SMILE at each other during their day-to-day meetings.<br />Then comes Christmas Eve and Chuck's leaving his girlfriend again, but not before presenting her with a small \\"proposal\\" to think about...(Hunt's \\"I'm scared\\" line is rattled off as if she's telling a waiter to add cheese to a hamburger she ordered.) He's off to personally escort a few packages(God knows WHY he has to do this but the script demands it for plot-movement) to their destinations by Christmas Day. This scene comes complete with ill-fated dialogue and the totally clich&eacute;d, \\"I'll be right back\\", spoken to Kelly(or yelled-to to be more accurate) by the equally ill-fated Chuck. I remember actually yelling at my T.V. set that you NEVER say that in a movie(see \\"Scream\\" and you'll know why) but what the heck do I know???<br />Once aboard, the pilots decide to avert a major storm by flying AROUND it...so much for THAT idea. The plane crashes into the South Pacific faster than a Randy Johnson-fastball and Chuck is outcast via a raft from said plane to a deserted island with no technology, no islanders, no Jurassic Park dinosaurs, and NO WAY TO GET HOME.<br />From here on, we get to watch Noland stumble around the island trying to obtain food, water, and shelter as well as an idea for how he's going to get off the island and get back to his life...all of which takes four years.<br />Now, before the nay-sayers comment that \\"this could have been really good\\" and call it BAD, I say that this could have been really BAD and I'm calling it good. It's actor Hanks and director Zemeckis's time and patience that pulls off the impossible(in their first re-teaming since \\"Forrest Gump\\"). Noland turns desparate as you see him go through the stages of becoming a survivor(fear, anger, acceptance, etc.), befriend a volleyball(which he paints a face on with his own blood and even goes so far as to implant \\"hair\\" using twigs and what-not), create fire(in a frustratingly funny scene), and spear fish and crab for edible goods.<br />I've read both sides of the debate on this film and I'm caught in the middle. I think this movie is successful. Robert Zemeckis makes a film that touches you not so much on an emotional level(not even the stupid volleyball evoked a sniffle when we witness its fate), but on a philosophical level. Before Hanks hits the island, he's a hurried man who rushes everything andyells at the top of his lungs. After the island, he's transformed into something humbled. You would think he would have trouble accepting his new life after he gets back home...but by now, it's so easy to him. Chuck has survived the hell of isolation and pain by himself. He makes his decisions without sadness, without angst, and with much acceptance. It's the primitive equivalent of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\".<br />Yes, the film's point is EXTREMELY heavy-handed: \\"time is important so make the most of it\\" and blah, blah, blah...but Zemeckis has such a wonderful way of softening the hand that's slapping you in the face(just like he softened it for \\"Gump\\" and the soft-spoken \\"Contact\\"), that it's easy to take. His use of sound and the decision to NOT use Alan Silvestri's understated and gentle music score during the island-scenes was the perfect choice. In my opinion, scoring the island-scenes would have dumbed the film down.<br />Not a great film, not a horrible film. \\"Castaway\\" is a good film that shows you one man's accelerated journey through life in which he learns the true meaning of becoming a mature human being.<br />(A couple of notes here: the \\"winking-whale\\" effect comes off as silly and why doesn't search-and-rescue follow the trail of loose-drifting packages since most seemed to end up on the isle with Chuck???)<br />--Mattat the top of his lungs.

B00005QXXO|4.0|I Might Be Wrong is a live recording of a set Radiohead took across Europe (Oslo, Berlin, Vaison-la-Romaine, and erm Oxford)in 2001.  Minus all the songs that made their name.  3 songs from Kid A, 3 from Amnesiac, 1 that crops up on both those records, Morning Bell, and a new track, True Love Waits.  The prospect of listening to the offspring of those two sibling albums: potentially bug-eyed, three-legged and otherwise \\"seriously\\" deformed, may not be a particularly attractive one.  But I Might Be Wrong has denied modern genetics and is actually a cracking album in its own right.<BR>The National Anthem and I Might be Wrong kick proceedings off.  Wired, buzzing, electrified and raw, these songs take on whole new dimensions when performed live.  <BR>Morning Bell has now popped up on 3 different albums within 2 years.  Bridging the gap between the Kid A original and the more organic, funeral-like take on it during Amnesiac, the song is driven by a gorgeous patter of drums by Phil Selway and a lonely keyboard, or treated piano, motif.  Mid-way through, the song suddenly takes off, fuelled by a buzzing electrified *noise* presumably from one or other of Johnny Greenwood's instruments, before all but the drums cut out as Yorke demands \\"Cut the kids in half, cut the kids in half\\".   The song appears to be about divorce before any of you start getting worried out there.  Yorke mutters in deep paranoia, and then an almost religious trance as Greenwood picks out ugly notes on his guitar.  <BR>And then comes the most startling track.  Like Spinning Plates was one of Amnesiac's more horrible pieces.  Eventually the backwards, slightly sickening, swirling track did grow, and take on a spectral landscape feel.  Here, however, Yorke is backed only by himself on piano.  To say the song is sumptuous is an understatement.  A hushed respectful silence falls on the crowd, as Yorke cries out: \\"I'm living in cloud cuckoo land.  And this just feels like spinning plates, Our bodies floating down the muddy river\\".  A gigantic round of applause turns into whoops of delight as the beat to Idioteque kicks in.<BR>Had this been released as a single back with Kid A, I'm sure it would have topped the charts.  An infectious, dancey, trippy, electronic piece of *weirdness* containing perhaps the definitive lyrics of this period from Radiohead.  Yorke comes alive on the record and round about \\"We're not scare-mongering, This is really happening, Happening, We're not scare-mongering This is really happening, Happening, Mobiles working mobiles chirping, Take the money and run, Take the money and run, Take the money and run\\", the whole crowd bursts out into spontaneous sing-along.  Now this song is about as far away from Wonderwall, or How You Remind Me as you can get.  It just goes to show the breadth and depth of Radiohead's reach.  At the end of the song Yorke giggles indulgently and self-congratulatory. The \\"miserable dwarf\\"..., can't contain himself.  That's how good it is.<BR>Everything in Its Right Place finally kicks in, with yet another beautiful underlying piano motif.  The song is as subdued as its Kid A counterpart, and rather suffers from what has preceded it.  That's not to say it isn't hypnotic, especially when Yorke's words are somehow cut and split into each other, colliding into one long headache, with the odd word bursting out.  As the song apparently deals with Yorke's frustration with the outside world and his messed up head during the OK Computer world tour, it illustrates his feelings perfectly.  The wailing pre-natal screech that cuts in at around 5 minutes 30 is deeply unpleasant, and this track certainly won't appeal to those who hated Kid A.<BR>Dollars and Cents follows, another of the weaker efforts from Amnesiac.  It is frankly amazing that having ignored songs of the quality of Pyramid Song; You and Whose Army?; Knives Out; Motion Picture Soundtrack and Kid A, (all of which could have been pulled from the parent albums), let alone thenumerous crowd pleasers from the Bends and OK Computer era, that Radiohead have come up with such a strong album.  Dollars and Cents fully evolves on this offering.  From a rather murky, non-descript song on Amnesiac, it is beautifully realised.  An organ provides a perfect companion for Yorke's voice, while a threatening bassline rumbles in the background.   \\"We are the dollars and cents, And the pounds and pence, And we're going to crack your little skull\\" spits out Yorke, before the song ends in a curious Johnny Marr-esque solo, minus any of the playfulness of the Smiths guitarist.<BR>True Love Waits is the absolute highlight.  A quiet, acoustic solo-Yorke ballad: it is one of the greatest songs Radiohead have ever done.  \\"I'll drown my beliefs, To have your babies. I'll dress like your niece, And wash your swollen feet.\\" Later Yorke pleads \\"Just don't leave\\" in the chorus and states \\"I'm not living, I'm just killing time\\".  The lyrics and Yorke's voice are haunting, passionate, cold and yet warm.  They sum up this record perfectly.<BR>Whatever, this record is a must if you own Kid A and Amnesiac, if only to allow you to go back to those records, and see how the songs grow, once you have heard them in such a raw environment.  If you own neither Kid A nor Amnesiac, I would strongly suggest buying Amnesiac first, and then this album.  Anyone who loves electronic music, buzzing basses, or spine-tingling ballads with a twist will find something for them on this record.  It perfectly completes the triptych.  The only question is, where do Radiohead go from here?

But you have my, um...well, my emotions and contextual waves are all in a mess because there's just no CREDENCE! I mean, man...when you make a soundtrack to this film and play two of Credence Clearwater's songs during crucial times in the film...you kinda expect to pick up a record, a cylindrical object with the Credence, man! I mean, SURE! You think you've got a winner, you pack all the other stuff on there! You've even got a better remix of HOTEL CALIFORNIA by the Gypsy Kings(I hate the freakin' Eagles), and that walking song will always remind me of Maude, but I can also seem to recall between all these Kaluha-filled White Russians, there was Credence played TWICE!

B00005B5L4|2.0|I have nothing against the music of Rumours -- it's certainly a classic Fleetwood Mac composition.  However, this DVD Audio does not give a significant audio improvement over the CD version.  Since DVD Audios cost more than CDs, I would go with the CD instead.  Although I don't know all the details that go into making a DVD Audio, I would think the quality issue would be influenced similarly to AAD vs. ADD vs. DDD on CDs.  Old albums that were recorded analog that later get converted to digital for CDs never sound as good as those that were recorded digitally.  I suspect this is why Rumours did not really show any superiority over the CD.
0688170528|5.0|This book really held my attention.  I finished it in only a few days.  It usually takes me a few weeks to read a book because I have limited time.  This is one of those books that keeps you up all night.  I really just couldn't put it down.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Journey videos are quite scarce these days so anything captured on DVD is a major plus for us Journey fans.  The performance on this video is flawless.  Steve Augeri doesn't miss a note or a beat.  The rest of the band is as good as ever.  And in case you didn't know, they brought Ross Valory (the comic relief of the band) back.  The new face behind the drums is Deen Castranovo of Ozzy Osbourne fame among others.  His performance is stellar as well.  The overall energy of the concert is outstanding and it is captured well on this DVD.  I could have done without the lengthy guitar solo but Neal played as well as ever with all the emotion he is known for.  As for the visual side, Steve Augeri is wearing his famous red leather pants and white shirt for this show and that is visual entertainment enough really!  But Steve also runs around the stage as if he's 20, revving up the crowd and himself, and it is just a pleasure to watch.  Augeri has a great stage presence and charisma as you will see in this DVD.  The songs covered are those you would expect and would want to hear.  New songs from Arrival are present but the set list is laden with classic Journey tunes.  If you haven't seen Journey live recently, buy the DVD to re-acquaint yourself with this timeless music.  If you have seen Journey live recently, buy the DVD to relive the memories.
0792151712|5.0|This is one of the most sucessful films of the year. All through 1997 and 98, everyone was talking Titanic, and it's easy to see why. The classic \\"love and tragedy\\"' seen in many movies is usually the mushy-mushy kind of thing but in this film, tied in with other things make it THE best movie of the year.<BR>The special effects for this movie were top-rate, as was the music and acting. I'm definately not an emotional guy, but this movie makes me cry due to the depressing ending and the choice of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" as the end theme song. <BR>Everyone I talked to loved it, it was certainly given all the attention it deserves!<BR>I can't say it enugh--it is EXCELLENT!
B0000648WZ|1.0|Someone else here said they hate to give this movie even one star and I have to agree. I have not read the book this movie is based on but I understand it is very good. I am not taking anything away from it or the author since I haven't read it myself. As for the movie ... This is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. I know that sounds harsh but this is one of only two movies I have ever had to fast forward through because I just couldn't sit through it -- I seriously tried. Denise Richards is a poor actress period but her performance in this movie was shockingly fake. Quite frankly, I was embarrassed for her ... and most of the cast really. I can't recall a single good performance. I have heard about the plot of the book and I see no resemblance in the movie. What did I get out of this movie as the point? Choppy scene progression, gratuitous nudity like I've never seen before, very campy sets, gratuitous language and sexual content, gratuitous and graphic violence like I've never seen before, and acting that was so bad that it couldn't have been more fake and contrived if the actors were holding their scripts throughout the film. Seriously, this movie had no merit whatsoever -- and I am trying to be gentle. Sorry folks. Just be glad you read this before you put good money on this.
0440219078|4.0|The giver is an outstanding book. This book shows how the lives of the people in the community is different than that of ours. Their life was more protected and kept to themselves than ours is. Our life is just plain out unpredictable. <BR>     At first I thought the book was boring because I dont usually like how books just take so much time in explaining the background of the story. I like books that just start out with the story then slowly have flash backs and tell what happened in the past. This book got interesting when Jonas became the Reciever of memory. Therefore I liked the book and i recomend that many people should read this.

B000066C6Z|5.0|My all time favourite comedy set in the german war era about good guys against bad, but with some very unusual twists and turns and hilarious outtakes.  What on earth is a fireplace doing parachuting, and the old western underwater bar complete with bartenders, locals and chandelier?  Most recommended to anyone with a almost-sick sense of humour!
0748662529|5.0|The title of this book called my attention so much, I bought the book in the spot.  What a wonderful surprise it was.  I immersed myself in this story. Precious Ramotswe is a charming character that will take you for a trip you won't forget.  This is one of those unique books that let you really feel the characters and the culture where they live, just by the way they act and think on their every day life. I went into the internet and researched the country of Botswana, so I could enjoy the book even better. Mc Call Smith has a wonderful way with words. I marked two or three pages during the reading of the story and found myself going back to reread them.  Only this kind of writer can make one truly enjoy reading something as simple as a character waking up in the middle of the night to have a glass of water. Wonderfully written to the smallest detail and with so much good humor too! Is a detective story so of course most of the mysteries are resolved in a satisfactory way, and if they aren't be ready for a good laugh. Definitely recommend this book and can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B00005JL3A|4.0|When i first heard about this movie I thought heck yeah, this is gonna take right off the games and when I heard George A. Romero was writing the script I was enthrilled even more. I later found out that he was fired and his script would be scrapped, that really (made me mad) especially after reading Romero's original draft for the movie. I found out they were going to have a new story with new characters and only 3 monsters: the zombies, howlers, and licker. I got back into it because I found out this was going to be a prequel to the games giving them a back-story. I downloaded it first off the internet to see if it was truly good and it was. Then I saw it in theatres. It was excellent, it suprised that the guy who did Mortal Kombat: Anihilation did this film. This film was really a one of a kind deal and a great risk because it didn't follow the games but it followed through. I will buy the dvd, you should too.
0060922583|4.0|If you are quite willing to have all your concepts about reality and all your rational perspectives of the universe challenged, this is the book for you.  <br />It is mind expanding and it goes quite a bit beyond what I am presently prepared to accept as truth, but I do sincerely recommend it to those willing to consider these ideas.  However, I do consider it basically speculative and of more interest to those who are metaphysically inclined than to those of a more scientific background.  Talbot does cite a number of scientists, including ones as highly respected as Albert Einstein and Bohr.  However, many others are ones who are more controversial than accepted.<br />Also cited are such people as Larry Dossey, Louise Hay, Carlos Castaneda and Ram Dass, people for whom I have at least partial respect, but who are not exactly accepted with open arms by basic scientists.<br />It is fascinating reading.  And I'll share this with you...while reading it and being geared to thoughts of the synchrocity in life, I apparantly attracted a number of &quot;coincidences&quot; into my life including a very welcome and needed windfall...not a huge one, but enough to enable me to do something I ernestly desired to do.<br />I have always felt that our thoughts are powerful and capable of affecting our own personal lives.  Talbot does go a bit further, though, and I can't presently buy the whole enchilada.  But I am glad I discovered the book and do recommend it to those who are willing to stretch their minds.
B0000541VU|5.0|When i first saw this movie it shcoked me..the movie was so distrubing at times..but than i realized how incredible this movie is..the acting in this movie is sensational...This movie is based on the controversial bestseller sleepers...this movie is based on a true story about four friends ...a prank that goes wrong and how the punishment absolutely doesn't fit the crime..while they are in a dentention center they are abused physically and sexual..all the innoscence they once had was ripped away...they live out there time and  move on still haunted by the evils they experineced..still scared of the pain they suffered...till one day two of the boys who are now men murder the man who is responsible for all their nightmares ..then they must all help each other to get them a not guilty verdict for this time the punishment again didn't fit the crime...this movie is a riverting movie...aboutlove, trust, truth, pain, suffering, revenge, peace...JUSTICE...

B00004TLMC|5.0|Alright this movie isn't the best movie in the world but i liked it in fact i enjoyed it. Tom cruise and Nicole Kidman gave wonderful performances...I beileve if Kurbrick lived to edit this film this would have been a masterpiece. This movie is about the reality and the flaws of a married couple and people. I enjoyed this film despite the negative reviews i rate this film as ***** five stars.

B00005N83M|1.0|This album has no shred of musicianship, creativity, originality, or even for that matter memorable songs. I suggest you get the music of Gloria Estefan someone who can REALLY sing and is very talented than get an album like this with absolutely no substance. Jennifer Lopez's Singing Career is ALL image NO substance.

There is Great songs on this I like all of them but my favorites are, People = Sh*T, My Plague, Everything ends, and Left Behind. All heavy metal fans, or SlipKnoT fans should by this CD.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is great music. One of the most talented and influential bands of the past 10 years. This band along with Nirvana(my fav band) Soundgarden and Alice in Chains changed american culture and music. These 4 bands brought music about pain and suffering to the mainstream. They single-handedly wiped out bland Hair Metal. What a great period of music did the early 90's bring. This album ranks alongside Nirvana's Nevermind as one of the best albums of the 90's. If you are looking for music that will touch your heart and soul with amazing lyrics then this album is for you. JUST BUY IT A.S.A.P!
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink is one of the best artists and one of the most expressive artists i have ever heard. Her new album \\"Misundaztood\\" breaks down all the walls holding back all the other artists from writing and singing anything they want. She is never afraid to be herself, and that is very present on this album. Every song has it's own little flare in it, and its not just regular teeny bopper music, it's a little hardcore, a little more mature. I have been to 24 or 25 of her concerts... i'm following the concert, in all i think i will have seen 37 or so at the end, i'm from Chicago, so we just saw my home town this past week! Each time she justs blows me away like it's my first time seeing her. Everyone deifnently needs to see her live, it's an experience to never be forgotten. I'm waiting for her 3rd album, and hopefully she will break down even more of the walls of the record industry, if she hasn't broke them all yet! As her tatoo says \\"What Goes Around Comes Around\\".
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash is arguably the best Punk band of all-time. Much more talented musically than The Ramones and The Sex Pistols. Dont get me wrong The Ramones and Sex Pistols Kick [...], but The Clash are special. Real Special. They had the courage to not LIMIT themselves in the very restrictive Punk world at the time. Punk music didnt need musicianship in the 70's. The Clash beg to differ. They incorporate Reggae, Jazz, and Rockabilly styles with their political lyrics beautifully. The Clash are Special indeed.
0060987464|5.0|Although I am not one of his die-hard fans, I was definitely moved by this book.  You can't read it just once, because once isn't enough.  He gives his readers food for thought and looks his critics (which are many) straight in the eye.  Honest, insightful and revealing, also touching and hilarious at times.  My favorite quote from the book sums up what I myself believe and stand for:  \\"ONLY THROUGH EXPERIENCE CAN YOU DETERMINE YOUR OWN MORALITY.  HUMANITY IS NOT ABOUT CONSTANTLY HAVING TO SEEK FORGIVENESS FOR BEING HUMAN;  HUMANITY IS LEADING A GUILTLESS EXISTENCE AS AN INDIVIDUAL.  THAT IS ARMAGEDDON, BECAUSE TO CHRISTIANITY IF YOU FORSAKE THE IDEA OF GOD AND BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, THE WORLD IS OVER.\\"  A lot of people would benefit by taking these words to heart.  Highly recommended.
B00005RFAI|1.0|Thats what Pink and this album deserve. Hey Pink werent you that R&B girl a while back? I didnt know that you were a Punk rocker Pink? Oh maybe thats because you're a poser. She gets into the music industry as an R&B girl so she gets fame that way and then turns around and expects people to believe you're punk the next album. Sorry Pink but REAL punk rockers dont sell their soul to record labels. They make music on their OWN terms and have no apologies for it. Dont buy this album and save your money for the new Joey Ramone album. You'll be glad you did.
B00005JKCF|2.0|**1/2 Perhaps it isn't all \\"Spider-Man\\"'s fault that it was released 24 years after the original \\"Superman\\" or 13 years after the original \\"Batman\\" movies.  But the fact is that those films beat this new film considerably to the punch, which probably explains why \\"Spider-Man,\\" for all its sophisticated special effects, feels decidedly Old Hat - especially compared to the infinitely more complex and sophisticated \\"X-Men\\" from a few years back, not to mention the brilliant \\"Darkman\\" from way back in 1990.  That last comparison is particularly apt since\\" Spider-Man\\"'s director, Sam Raimi, virtually cut his teeth on that film.  In \\"Darkman,\\" Raimi brought a seriousness of purpose and a uniqueness of vision to the project that helped to carry the comic book movie genre to new artistic heights.  \\"Spider-Man,\\" though inoffensive, seems bland and benign in comparison, calculated to reach the widest audience possible (which apparently it has succeeded in doing, a fact that says less about the quality of the movie, perhaps, than about the undemanding tastes of modern moviegoers).<br />\\"Spider-Man\\" seems so by-the-book in its narrative, tone and purpose that it never soars much above the ordinary and never carries the audience to the kind of exciting, visionary world one would expect from a film of this type.  The movie is blessed in one all-important respect though: its inspired decision to cast Tobey Maguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, a mild mannered nerd who becomes a super hero after he's bitten by a genetically altered spider.  Maguire's winning and disarming performance is the film's one incontestable virtue.  All else seems problematic, beginning with the storyline, which plays virtually by rote.  One needn't list all the conventional elements, starting with the poor, picked-on geek who can't get the girl he loves to even acknowledge his existence, the loving, older guardians who support their boy in everything he does, the tortured super villain (in this case, the Green Goblin) who is both the hero's alter ego as well as his arch nemesis.  All this is, of course, par for the course, but I guess the thing I object to the most is that the tone is simply too innocuous and sunny.  The film can't generate any real suspense or excitement because the threats seem so halfhearted.  By the same token, the film doesn't have much of a playful spirit either.  The love scenes between Spider-Man and his truelove, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), work only because the actors themselves are so likable in the roles.  Otherwise, the romantic element is as underwhelming and clich&eacute;d as virtually every other feature of the film.  Probably the most unaccountable aspect of the plot is that, despite the fact that Spider-Man does only good for the citizens of Manhattan, we keep being told that the citizens are ambiguous in their attitudes towards him.  Yet, we are given no reason to credit this possibility for even a split second.  It is an arbitrary plot device thrown in to try and generate some desperately needed suspense in an admittedly pretty lackluster screenplay.<br />Which pretty much leaves us with the special effects.  Though adequate at times, many of the shots of Spider-Man swooping along the streets of New York City, his web suspended from the tops of skyscrapers, seem strangely unconvincing.  Perhaps since we feel no immediate involvement in the proceedings, the special effects sequences never manage to catch us up in the excitement of what they are showing us.

B000066AXC|5.0|I am not a fan of Russell Crowe, so when I decided to go see the film, I was a bit apprehensive. I went into the film, not expecting much- but I left the theatre mesmerized. The characterization was WONDERFUL. Russell Crowe sucks his audience into the plot. Jennifer Connelly is also wonderful, as is Ed Harris. Ron Howard's direction is also superb. Don't miss the opportunity of seeing this film, because it is amazing.
B00006690F|3.0|After selling over 20 million copies of his 2000 blockbuster, \\"The Marshall Mathers LP.\\", releasing his own cartoon, book, and countless other items, the crazy white boy from Detroit is back... and better then ever? You decide.<br />Controversial figures in music never last long. The same thing going on with Eminem was the same thing that went on with Marilyn Manson, who released \\"Anti Christ Superstar\\" in 1996 with a slew of controversy following right behind it. Then came back two years later with an album that marked the end of his reign as the controversial music figure of the moment.<br />But just as \\"The Marshall Mathers LP.\\" went straight to the top, so has \\"The Eminem Show\\". The album opens up with the powerful and brutally honest track, \\"White America\\" and explains why the MC has been so successful. Even though Eminem might appear to you as a crazy, homicidal maniac who bashes his mom and (ex) wife, it is clear he's held onto his grip of reality.<br />Then we see the first weak point of the album, \\"Business\\" where Eminem sounds so lazy and tired that it comes off like a bad studio session. The beat is trademark Eminem. Goofy, poppy, silly and annoying after the first few listens.<br />Although Eminem quickly rescues the album with the next two brilliant tracks, \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" and \\"Square Dance\\". We've all heard the hype about \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\", and after Eminem's countless stories about being mistreated as a child, you'll begin to wonder who you really feel sorry for. The mother who received this lyrical attack or Eminem for being pushed so far as to make this song. On the other hand, \\"Square Dance\\" is just another silly Eminem track with a BRILLIANT line about 9/11 and The Navy that will leave you amazed.<br />The next skit, and two songs launch right back into Eminem dragging you into his personal life. \\"The Kiss\\" reinacts a particular incident in the summer of 2000 that involved his wife Kim, and a bouncer at a club she was attending. \\"Soldier\\" also touches on the same subject, as well as \\"Goodbye To Hollywood\\" which also touches on a lawsuit Eminem faced by pulling a gun on an associate of The Insane Clown Posse.<br />The album hits another downfall. \\"Drips\\" featuring new Shady Records act, Obie Trice who is getting annoying fast. SKIP! Next is the single, \\"Without Me\\" which is so blatantly targeted towards the radio in hopes to cause controversy for the album that it might sound out of place on a rather personal album. The same reason it gets really old really fast. It's humorous and fun, but Eminem's best work was NEVER represented with his obvious \\"let's do a pop tracks just to sell the album\\" songs.<br />After a huge downfall Eminem picks the album up again from slight doom. \\"Sing For The Moment\\" is this album's \\"Stan\\" which samples Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" perfectly. The lyrics are so personal, meaningful and touching to anyone who can relate to them. It's a stand out and a masterpiece.<br />Another downfall. \\"Superman\\" is boring and pointless. Corny sex songs haven't been entertaining in a long while. I skip this mostly every time. Talk about killing the mood WAY too much. But following this song is a plesent suprise. An ode to his daughter that expresses everything he feels about her while maybe politely giving the finger to critics who pre-judged him as being a bad father by songs like \\"Bonnie And Clyde\\" and \\"Kim\\". Even though Eminem REALLY isn't a talented \\"singer\\" (which he points out in the beginning), it's very admirable that he would put a song like this out, leaving the people who wrote him off as a juvenile, publicity seeking moron scratching their heads at this moving tribute and asking \\"Who's the real Marshall Mathers?!\\" Much like the comedian Andy Kaufman who Em is an admitted fan of (the front and back cover even resembles the \\"Man On The Moon\\" movie cover), we'll never know.<br />Skip the Steven Berman skit. These are really getting old. \\"When The Music Stops\\" brings in Em's Detroit crew D12 and personally gets me hype for the next D12 album dropping next year. \\"What You Say\\" rips Jermaine Dupri. What makes this track even more enjoyable is that even before \\"The Eminem Show\\" dropped, Jermaine released an embarassing comback that's just laughable. The battle was over with this song. Dre comes off tight on this song even though it's clear his verse was ghost written.<br />\\"Till I Collapse\\" is a DOPE song! Eminem rips it with tight multi sylable lyrics while Nate Dogg on the chorus compliments it even more. It's a perfect combo. Whenever you bring Nate in to do the chorus, it's certain success. The album closes with \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\". Another ode to his daughter which is slightly more disturbing. With threats of blowing everything except Afganistan off the map, calling out Laura and George Bush, and opening with Eminem doing drugs in front of his daughter, it's typical humor expressed on Eminem's mainstream debut, \\"The Slim Shady LP.\\" At the present time, news has broken out that Eminem is being targeted by terrorists for dressing up as Osama Bin Laden in his \\"Without Me\\" video and with this song as well as the opening track, probably landing him in deep trouble with the government.<br />Although it's not as good as the first two albums, and maybe not even as good as his two underground EP.'s, it is a pleasing follow up to \\"The Marshall Mathers LP.\\" and shows us yet another side to Marshall Mathers. Who's multiple personalities will provide us with even more sides to the man as well as more entertainment to keep us interested for a long time.
B00006690F|2.0|With all the press and scrutiny that Marshall \\"Eminem\\" Mathers<BR>gets,you can't help but be  bombarded with his overly publicized,scrutized very public profile.After becoming a househould name and the (mostly white)<BR>press' poster boy for \\"bad behavior\\" with his multi-platinum 2000 opus \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\",Eminem comes back to stir up more \\"controversy\\" with his followup,\\"The Eminem Show\\".<br />Now I know that surburban kids and even many real hip hop heads are going to applaud this album but the real deal with \\"The Eminem Show\\" is that it's no real \\"Show\\"-stopper...<br />This album is rather dull,predictable,and redundant.Never have I seen a hardcore hip hop album so blantantly targeted to white,<BR>surburban youth.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what Eminem's formula is:spit raunchy,\\"shocking\\" rhymes over slow,<BR>menacing beats that give kids in the \\"boondocks\\" a taste of the thug life and mischievous excitement that they so crave and then whine about how bad your life is.<BR>That's the basic formula and \\"The Eminem Show\\" milks it for all it's worth.<br />Eminem tries to play with the issues of race and the government<BR>on this 77 minute opus' opener \\"White America\\",spitting rhymes that claim that his white skin color was the real reason for his MTV success and that the government just wants to blame him for society's problems.Good premise but Eminem sounds so dim and harried that his point never leaves the ground and \\"America\\" comes off flat and as yet another attempt to shock.<BR>Obligatory \\"I hate my life\\"-styled tracks like \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\" and the perky,Dr. Dre-produced \\"Business\\" will get the \\"TRL\\" crowd cheering but won't do anything for real music heads,if you ask me.<br />Now I'll give Eminem props by saying that \\"Show\\" is very well-produced but what's the point when the rhymes are so redundant<BR>and so forced.The misogynistic sex rap \\"Superman\\" sounds very odd coming from a man who once rhymed that he wanted to slaughter hiswife now boasting about his prowess with the females.And the unattractive sex rap \\"Drips\\" is just simply another boring turn-off.<BR>Trudging cuts like \\"Till I Collaspe\\" and the Dre-produced Jermaine Durpri diss \\"Say What You Say\\" also make you want to get a pillow and call it a night because this has been done so many times before by him.<BR>(I won't even mention the unabashed MTV-aimed first single<BR>\\"Without Me\\":Is it me or does it sound like he's rapping over bad club music?)<br />So yes,that's the deal,Mr. Mathers is out to swear his way to the bank(which he's already done,considering that this album sold a million copies in it's first full week of release) and unnerve the establishment but instead in reality,\\"The Eminem Show\\" is basically a stale,repetitive,un-shocking bore.

B00005OLAS|3.0|The human storylines and character interplay that made ST a hit with fans in the first place are drowned in a sea of needless and endless special effects sequences.  That said, I still love this movie.  The emotional energy of reuniting the cast and the sub-plot of Spock coming to terms with his humanity make the shortcomings durable.  Hint:  Get the wide-screen editions of the entire movie series or you will miss a lot.
B000002MP2|5.0|I'm 15 from So Cali, i bought this album long ago actually when i was even smaller in 95'. this album is a great testiment to punk and kids everywhere, the amazing songs actually make sense and have a deeper sense of meaning in them plus sarcasm that is usually misunderstood by people who know \\"punk\\".<BR>what is punk? i've heard people scream and shout about what punk really is, but they have no idea. most of my friends are \\"punks\\" and in their attempt to be social rejects are actually accepted by most people (except for old people of course), but this album is punk no matter how u look at it. even if it is their first that put them in the mainstream that doesnt take away the fact that its not rebellious, real, punkish, meaningful, and great music. <br />green day is amazing and their songs are so truthful and fun to listen to. whatever green day does is great, just listen to billie joe talk about his music and you'll know his serious and really doesnt [care] about what people who \\"know good music\\" think. nobody cares bout u ... anyway so why u baggin on one of green days masterpieces? anyway im sorry bout the ranting and raving, green day rules and to really get to know em u gotta go to their concerts, billie joe is the funniest musician alive.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I'm quite perplexed by the other reviews I've read of \\"YHF\\" on this website.  Why on earth are so many people afraid of changes?  As some have pointed out the majority of negative reviews of this album come from Wilco fans who feel betrayed or for some selfish reason reject the group's amazing artistic growth.  Some fans they are, right?<br />Listen:<BR>\\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is absolutely brilliant.  Taken on any number of levels, this is art in its purist form.  Like all great albums this one takes a few listens before it swims into the listener's subconscious--and I think the initial \\"WHAT?!??!\\" reaction people have is just because their ears are not accustomed to hearing anything like this.  The haunting production gives a whole new spin on these potential pop songs and turns them into faded melodies lingering in the air.  Memorable, sometimes surreal lyrics are the perfect compliment to this dreary record.  I'm certain each listener has a different interpretation of the songs on this album but keeping in mind a searching-for-a-radio-frequency-for-communication-and-only-finding-distortion theme can definitely put new spins on each track.<br />Do not be afraid of this album...!
B000002L68|5.0|This is one of those classic 80's soundtracks that WILL stand the test of time and will never grow old.  If you remember the mid-80's, then you absolutely know the classic hits that lace this epic soundtrack that has sold over 12 million copies to date.  It's almost like a greatest hits package, and you know the hits that are here.  'Let's Go Crazy', 'Take Me With U', 'When Doves Cry', and the title track 'Purple Rain' which is perhaps the most powerfully emotional song that Prince has ever recorded onto tape.  When you listen to that song, you are instantly pulled right in to the moment.  Even the songs that weren't singles are really good.  'The Beautiful Ones' is a slower song that is full of soul and 'Baby I'm A Star' is just non-stop, charged-up fun.  You get the idea, this is a classic, so don't let your music collection do without it.  Grab it, listen, and have yourself a party!  ROCK ON!!
B00003CXI1|5.0|I didn't read the Harry Potter books although I did buy them for my Grandchildren. I now intend to read them all immediately!!!!!!!I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. From beginning to end, I didn't move from my chair. I'm a science fiction fan and a fan of English authors here I have the best of both worlds.Daniel Radcliffe is perfect as Harry Potter and his performance was \\"enchanting\\". The whole cast was perfect. I could have done without Harry's miserable Aunt and Uncle but in every life a little rain must fall. Hogwarts is a delight. Too bad there are no schools like that in real life.  Or are there? The adventures are mind boogling and the movie itself is \\"awesome\\".I wish we could all experience a real \\"quidditch\\" match. Wouldn't that be a wonder.The author has an imagination that I truly envy. The movie is wonderful. A delight for the mind, imagination and the eye.It will truly cast a spell over you.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Very very good kids film. Imaginative and fun.  Could not find the seven deleted scenes that were advertised on the back of the package?
B00005MP58|5.0|I am a great fan of British TV and Movies. I've always thought English film and TV productions are far superior to our productions and this just proves my point.The acting, scenery and everything on screen is a treat for the eyes and ears.Colin Firth is wonderful as the broodingly handsome Mr. Darcy. His arrogance and charm come through and he develops all through the movie. It's wonderful to watch.Jennifer Ehle is a beautiful and independant Elizabeth who give him a taste of his own medicine.The cast is truly outstanding. Elizabeths family is typical of the times and her father is a bit of a weak man who has just  given up and accepts what life has given him. The mother is a twit who hasn't a thing between her ears but air. Jane is a good older sister but a bit colorless. Lydia is perfectly acted and comes across just as she's supposed to. Poor Mr. Wickham. As bad as he's portrayed, you almost feel sorry for him, being stuck with that flighty Lydia for the rest of his life. The other sisters are rather non-descript but add to the story in their own way.Mr. Darcy is dark and brooding. He is also in his own way kind and generous. This comes out later as his charactor developes into a most wonderful person.This is definitely one of the finest productions by A&amp;E. Jane Austen would be proud.

It had old New York, time travel and a good love story.After falling through time, Jackman adapts pretty quickly. The small scene with the cop and dog is quite telling of the differences he encounters.Although he's an aristocrat, he is quite the gentleman. Meg is the typical \\"career girl\\" as he dubs her and it's all fun from there.The acting by the supporting cast is wonderful. The movie is just delightful.Watch and enjoy!!!!! Definitely a \\"Chick Flick\\".

Sarah Michelle Gellar, played the part of the bitchy Kathyrn Merteuil to the fulliess, and Resse(Annette Hargrove) and Ryan(Sebastian Valmont) did too.  Selma Blair(Cecil Caldwell) totally played the whole dumb, school girl act. The whole thing just made you want to be them for a short time. To wonder what it would be like, to feel like to play games and treat people like toys. Maybe its just me that loves this movie so much because i have some  intentions that are cruel myself, but this movie gets 2 thumbs up and 5 ***** stars for me. But the second one Cruel intentions 2, uumm didn't really like it. Kinda a fake to me, I'll stick with the orignal. But always this will be in the top five of my all time favorites.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Although the acting (or lack there-of) of one particular character stands out in this film, (Anakin) this film will be remembered as one that people can watch over and over again.  Except, of course, for Jar-Jar Binks.<BR> Anyway, the plot is so amazingly simple, the movie is just timeless, like the other STAR WARS.  Because there is no real ending to the story, no one can spoil it for you, therefore, it never gets old.  I think Lucas did a great job at making a movie that people of all ages can watch and enjoy.  If you have children, and do not own this movie, buy it!  They will love it, and you won't want to smash it against the wall after they watch it for the 80th time.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Finally, a David Lynch movie worth watching! &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is an incredible film which contrasts the hopes and dreams that Hollywood generates in a young woman with the Hollywood reality that she lives. Don't go into this looking for a straightforward plot line. The &quot;narrator&quot; -- the young woman -- is unreliable, and the way she thinks the Hollywood world operates isn't necessarily so. We gradually discover that the early idealistic parts of the move are her fantasies about what Hollywood would do for her. What actually has become of her unfolds as Lynch takes us from fantasy to reality. By the end, I was blown away -- and I've hated about everything else the man made.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie was non-stop action from the moment it began to the moment it ended.  I walked out of the theatre with an adrenalin rush.  Just like Saving Private Ryan showed the Rangers of WWII, this movie shows the Rangers of today.  It also shows two other top-notch special operations groups: 160th SOAR (basically, the best military helicopter pilots in the world) and Delta (a small group of covert, fast-attacking, grade-A marksmen).  This movie does a great job at showing the comradery that these warriors share and gives some much earned respect to these men for the service they provide.  &quot;Nightstalkers don't quit!&quot;  &quot;Rangers lead the way!&quot;
B00005QIPH|4.0|This album is the greatest Ive listened in years. I recommend to everyone who likes the music that matters
B000062XMO|4.0|It's an entertaining movie. Not one I plan to add to my library, but worth the rental price. It's a typical action movie, with strong performances by Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman (he does so well in this type of role). Nothing spectacular about it, but it is enjoyable.
B000002UD0|5.0|John Lennon &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; was great.This album was made at a time when Lennon's relationship with Yoko Ono had collapsed.1974 was a year of chaos and joy for John Lennon.&quot;Wheatever gets Thru the Night&quot; was a great rock dancer song(Elton John was colaboreted in this song playing keyboards).<BR>The supporting cast of musicians is too numerous to name, but there are two 'guest' musicians of note: Elton John and Harry Nilsson. Kudos go to Elton John for his role in getting John Lennon back on track and reunited with Yoko Ono.Hail Lennon, you are great. The album is ESSENTIAL
0790729628|2.0|Harrison Ford is a very talented actor. I love mostly all his movie with few exceptions, this is one of them. I rented this movie thinking it would be thrilling, considering it was directed by Ridley Scott and starred Harrison Ford. Don't get me wrong, the movie is very visually impressive and is well-directed, but the plot is plain out weird and boring. I felt like I was falling asleep at some parts and then waking up fifteen minutes later not knowing what had happened. I never did fall asleep, it just felt like that. It is worth watching for special effects and direction, but the plot and story is really boring and confusing.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Jones' smooth, soothing voice is an instant relaxer.  Her music is a little melancholy, unhurried, worry-free, perfect for winding down.  This is great music to put on for dinner or when you're chatting, &amp; it's equally nice to just wallow in the introspective lyrics.  Don't Know Why &amp; Come Away with Me are awesome.  Her rendition of Cold Cold Heart is so unlike Hank Williams that you'll wonder if it's even the same song.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I love this movie! A great black comedy-drama that asks \\"What do you want out of life?\\" This movie is the best directed movie I've seen and is definitely in my Top Ten. This movie is very well-acted, well-directed, and has a very clever and twisted plot. The movie follows a nameless, forsaken man (Edward Norton) that hates his job and sees nothing out of life. On a plane, he meets an anarchist that makes and sells soap, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). The two create a club called \\"Fight Club\\" that invites other forsaken men to release their tension by beating each other's brains out. Tyler keeps wanting to take the club up a notch and ends up creating a terroist army to abolish credit card companies to rid debt. This movie will leave you saying \\"Holy [junk]!\\"
B000065U1N|1.0|What's the deal with this film? It is so biased and unrealistic. They show one side as suffering heroes and the other as barbarians. It's quite an anoying film. The worst: the only credible character falls into stereotype at the end.<br />One other thing. The movie plays as a drama, but then you have a soldier preparing gourmet coffee on the middle of the battle and then the 3 soldirs/stooges come in to play with a donkey. At that point is when it becomes a mockery of the actual events, making ridicule of what happened. Quite a difficult movie to stand.
0783211856|5.0|This movie is a classic gem that is, in my opinion, the greatest movie of all-time!!! Liam Neeson does an excellent job in portraying Schindler, a German owner of a factory that saved Jews from concentration camps to have them work for him in this factory. Schindler slowly and gradually disnounced the war and what the Germans did to Jews as it went on. Schindler tried to save as many Jews as he could by having them work for him. This is a true story and the director Steven Spielberg makes that piece of history a movie masterpiece. Even the style of the movie is brilliant! The movie starts out with a color vision of some Jews sitting down to perform a sedar on passover. The movie then turns black-and-white to tell the story of Oskar Schindler. Throughout the movie, there are different color segment that express symbolism and harsh meaning. I do not cry during movies, I just don't. But this movie made me bawl like a baby at the end. Highly reccommended!
0446677450|1.0|The book could have been easily stated in one page. I also think many if not all the anecdotes were concocted. The guy has made himself rich on wind alone. We've been had. There's no way I am going to read his second book.
B0000639FE|4.0|Jerry Maguire leaves you smiling with those famous one-liners and the very funny and cute Jonathan Lipnicki. This movie brings an all-star cast to tell the story of a sports agent that had it all until he opened his mouth. He was fired and dishonored by his co-horts until he met a girl. At fist he just thinks she's hot, but goes along to marry and fall in love with this woman. With ups and downs, this movie is light-hearted and leaves you feeling good about yourself.
B00005K3NY|5.0|Just wanted to add that, some 20 years after sneaking in to see this film at a beachfront dive, I still remember bits &amp; pieces of its score and bleak imagery as vividly as if I had seen it only yesterday. There's some wonderfull stuff here.
B000002AH1|5.0|I first bought this album in 1971 and was BLOWN AWAY. HOW A BASS PLAYER AND DRUMMER CAN IMPROVISE ON SUCH A SIMPLE RIFF IS UN-BELIEVABLE. THAT TRACK IS \\"SAY WHAT\\". Jack de Johnette's drum solo on this record Is AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE. MILE'S TRUMPET IS SO ATTACKING AND SWEET TOO. One of the GREATEST IMPROVISING ALBUMS I'VE EVER HEARD AND ALL THE OTHER MUSO'S DOWN HERE IN AUSTRALIA WOULD AGREE.,  Barry Harvey (CHAIN).
1402511787|5.0|Still under it's spell - I only finished the book a while ago - I want to share my impressions with my co-readers. The beauty of the book. Ian McEwan belongs to the blessed few. Twice blessed he is, not only is he capable of conveying in the most exquisite language that what he sees, but the richness of what he sees, the subtleties in people and nature, is a gift of the priviledged. To the others it remains invisible.<br />The plot is perfect. Of course Briony saw the perpetrator at the crime scene. With her mind's eye, prompted by her unconscious, she did. Remember she had been in love with him, and although, at some point, she says she forgot all about that feeling, how could she have forgotten?<br />And the ending is food for thought. When fiction and reality -thin partitions do their realms divide- finally overlap and blend into one and only phantasy. Our mortal destiny.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah reminds me of Crystal Gayle. I think the Amazon Review was way off. The songs are soft and flowing. He is right, if they were livened up they would get more radio play, but they would not be anywhere near as good. This collection has nice flowing jazzy rhythms with soft beautiful vocals.
B000002WPI|5.0|this is the first wu tang cd i got.  it is the best one i have even after i have bought many more of them. all of the songs are good except number 5 isnt really that good. if you like rap get this cd because you will enjoy it a lot.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Cast Away is a movie that makes you take stock. What if all the stuff we're used to in our lives vanished tomorrow? What would we do if we were cut off from everything we know--all our comforts, all of our routines, and even the slightest human contact?<br />This movie deals with all of these questions while at the same time doing away with the \\"stranded in a tropical paradise\\" cliche.<br />Cast Away is also a very fine movie. Tom Hanks is the finest of actors. His work with Robert Zemeckis will no doubt set standards for an actor/director duo that will be hard to even approach. Hanks must carry this picture all by himself for well over half of the screen time. That he does so with seeming ease is not only a credit to him as an actor, but is also the mark of a truly great director.<br />This DVD version of the movie is very attractive. A double disc package, it does not skimp on extras as some movies (Harry Potter comes to mind here) have. The best parts are the feature on survival techniques, a Charlie Rose interview, and the story of Wilson.<br />Zemeckis' commentary is also a big, big plus. There is so much more to this movie than what meets the eye. The commentary helped me catch a lot of things I would have otherwise missed.<br />I give Cast Away my wholehearted recommendation.
B000065V1V|4.0|Bowie is back!...  No really, he's back...  I swear it's like he tapped into the Bowie genius and brought some of it to this cd. Not on every track or in every way, but it's there.   He did that a bit on the last cd as well.  And that's good...  because when Bowie is good he's brilliant.  If you're a Bowie fan, who knows this is true, give this new cd a listen.  I'm starting to believe that Bowie's best work might still be ahead of him.  Can you imagine how cool that would be?
B00003CX5P|1.0|I hate this film more than any other film I have ever seen. The dialog is some of the worst I've ever heard, I have never known any kids to ever say \\"yippee\\" at all, yet Jake Lloyd say it twice in less than two hours. I think every one knows that Ewan McGregor is a good actor, you would only have to see Trainspotting to confirm that, but he looks lost in this film, the same as I felt when I was watching this...<br />Lucas has tried to defend this film by saying \\"its for kids\\" well that still doesn't get rid of the bad acting, weak script, flat direction and special fx which are far from special - it just makes it [bad] kids film!
6300216209|4.0|Okay, I'm not good with all this mushy romance stuff, but I found myself drawn to Ali McGraw's witty character, Jenny.<BR>It's truly a wonderful movie, but now, after many films are based on the same thing (girl with terminal disease, lover devastated), it's gotten a bit old. I still refer to this movie as &quot;the first - and best - of many.&quot; I didn't exactly like Ryan O'Neal's character, Oliver, because he was just too deep to me. Sorry, true love makes me sick. Other than that, this movie is the only drama-total romance one I can stand. Definitely a must-see.
B00003CY6L|4.0|who still hold out hope that good things come to those who wait,..and believe in romance.  This is a romantic comedy that doesn't present anything totally shocking and different, yet it is truly enjoyable as just what it is.  Some other reviewers seem to have forgotten the type of movie it is supposed to be.  Well acted, well done, and totally funny.<BR>Jeremy Previn is great as the best friend.  And Molly Shannon also gives a very respectable performance as &quot;Sara's&quot; best friend.  It also did keep that subtle underlying suspense about how they would actually end up until the very end....Only after you've watched it several times, the suspense has worn off and of course you know how it ends.  I am a huge fan of John Cusak's,  I think he is not only adorable but also a good actor.  With that said, even I will admit that the ONE thing that did seem a little mushy and over the top was the single tear coming down his cheek when he sees her again in one of the final scenes.  However, to any other &quot;movie fan&quot; who thinks that ANYONE else could have performed this so-totally quintessential Cusak role,  I seriously have to differ....and I would maintain my position on that until that book with the phone number comes &quot;home!&quot;
B000065U1N|1.0|This is the worst war movie ever made, that's if you're not a soldier already and buy into this [bad stuff]. Ridley Scott directed this like it was an episode of Miami Vice. Quick cuts, so-so soundtrack and some action scenes do not make a movie good... DON'T BUY INTO THIS MYTHY. Plus take into account this is a story about the worst military exercise in our nations history. The Mogadishu ATTACKS were the worst planned attacks ever. If you want to feel patriotic go buy Full Metal Jacket or Apocalypse Now. These war movies have been made by two of the best directors of our time. Don't waste your money buying Black Hawk Down...
B000065U1N|5.0|I thought the movie was awesome. I give it 5 stars.
B000062TU1|4.0|My daughter has been reading the Harry Potter Series to my 5 year old grandson.  They have almost completed the last published book in the series, and eagerly await the next book.<br />It has been interesting to hear my grandson 'compare' the book to the movie.  He has learned much about discrimination, differences, and choices from seeing the movie.  He has been able to share with me how he had 'pictured' the characters and the situations, and how they were shown in the movie.  I think this is an excellent 'followup' to having read the book.<br />The minds of the artists who made this movie are very creative, innovative, and the new modern technology is superb. There are few movies that can include ALL the script from the book.  Chris Columbus made excellent choices as to what would move the story along.  Kudos to the cast, the staff, and all those who brought this movie to finality.<br />A good rule of thumb...Always read!! Don't allow reading to become a lost art! After reading a book or story, then view the movie to see how the director interprets the book.  It will teach you much about YOURself, and your own imagination!!
B00000J9HF|4.0|Giulini is magnificent...the younger Domingo is outstanding...Cotrubas, with her oddly unique voice, is quite fine.  But Cappuccilli!  I have never heard him in any recording in which he projected anything but a solid, lovely, and utterly bland and characterless voice.  The operative words might be: disappointing, boring, and--you get the point.  For Giulini alone, the recording *might* get five stars.  But without a Rigoletto, well, it's a true shame.  I'll keep listening, and pretend that I'm hearing Merrill or Warren, or even Fischer-Dieskau.
0783229526|5.0|Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was an intelligent look at the drug generation by looking at 2 of the most demented souls wandering the most depraved city in the western United States (er, outside of Hollywood, which is in the somewhat prologue of the story).  Director Gilliam and stars Depp and Del-Torro capture that essence finitely from first drug to last.  Truth be told, not everyone will like this movie; the first time I saw it 3 years ago I didn't know what the hell was going on most of the time, as I'm sure many of the critics who saw this movie must've felt.  But, truth be told again, it grows on you in a very surreal and good fashion.  Only minor complaint- the absense of Sympathy for the Devil in the beginning.
B000000OAA|5.0|In 1977 or so, when I was 11, I bought &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;, my first LP. This vinyl version met the abuses of overplay, and has since been replaced with a CD. It was one of Queen's first albums, and the first to get any decent radioplay.<br />I bought it entirely for &quot;Killer Queen,&quot; which played frequently on Chicago's legendary WLS AM radio station. However, I learned the 'deep cuts' of an album can be as good as the radio hits.<br />Pure testosterone rock songs like &quot;Tenement Funster&quot; are balanced by more philosphical tunes like &quot;Now I'm Here,&quot; but with no less rock power. Brian May's guitar and Freddie's voice drive through hard drum lines.<br />More in the ballad-like genre is &quot;Dear Friends,&quot; which is the weakest cut of the album. It seems out of context. &quot;Lily of the Valley&quot; has a similar peacefulness, but works well.<br />&quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot; is a fun, 1920s kind of tune. Catchy melody.<br />Maybe you know of Queen's Greatest Hits, and have dug &quot;Bohemian Rapsody.&quot; You won't find that kind of epic song here, but you will find rock that... rocks.<br />I fully recommend &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; by Queen.<br />Anthony Trendl
B000062YAZ|5.0|This album rules, there's a tons of real heavy stuff. Its a real masterpiece. I think Raining Blood is the best one on this album.
B00006690F|4.0|This is by far his best lyrical album. Everysong is put together more cleverly than in any of his other cd's and this should distinguish him as one of the best lyricists ever. Hovever his album is missing something. In every song there is a slight flaw. Starting with the first: the lyrics are untouchable but the beat is punk/techno, which is not great for rap. And ending with the last track: the lyrics are again great but the annoying chorus featuring his young daughter taints any possible greatness. Despite this, if you like true rap you need to cop this.
0385503954|4.0|I don't care what some of the 'BAD REVIEWERS&quot; say about &quot;Atonement&quot; by master writer Ian McEwan, I thought this book was exceptional!  It had me glued to my seat throughout the entire read! (No-doubt they are jealous of this author's success and ratings!)  Pity they can so easily slam a wonderful writer and his hard earned labors so casually because of the green-eyed monster inside themselves!<br />Buy the book and see for yourself this is without fail one of the best books out so far this year!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem For A Dream is not a film to be messed around with. It is a very brutal film depicting four Coney Island people and the anti-climax outcome of their lives. There is one thing that they all share, and that is an addiction. Whether it be an addiction to TV, diet pills, or heroin, they are all brought under the spell of the thought that there is a better life beyond the lives they lead. Interestingly but beautifully directed by Darren Aronofsky of Pi fame; comes the real to life brutality of drugs to the screen in a way that would normally never be seen. A very talanted cast consisting of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans bring the story to life in great depth. You begin to feel for the characters and wonder why these normal people have chosen the paths that they have taken to self destruction. Even though this film is not intended for a young audience, it should be seen by any teenager who is thinking of experimenting with drugs of any sort. I am pleased that the director did not give in to the MPAA by editing any scenes from the film to avoid the doomed American NC-17 rating, but releasing it as unrated for the world to see just where lives can lead with drugs in you're system. >Enjoy<
B000002HK4|5.0|Being a major DT fan, I have to put my 2 cents in on this one...  The title track is worth the price of admission, as it is a very complex, moving piece that highlights all the talents of the band.  The covers that make up the rest of this CD are done to perfection, although I did not expect anything less.<br />The major problem with DT is that anyone I try to turn on to DT is that they say \\"it sounds like everyone else, derivative\\" etc...  This just may be true, however makes for a perfect formula to do great covers!  What I DON'T agree with from others that call DT derivative is that I don't believe that everything else out there is not 'derived' from some place or another - granted, DT does 'rip off' some riffs/sounds now and then, but the core of their music - songwriting, intense arrangements, impeccable production - is not just some lame rip-off of 70/80's rock.  They are honestly trying to make some great music, albeit at the expense of their roots - not a big crime, really...<br />DT is for those (like me) who wish that someone would make some intricate, progressive rock with melody, like the stuff I listened to in the 70/80's - except 'step it up' into today's time - without selling out into rap/nu metal.  This is what Dream Theater is - true to their roots, and true to their fans. Gotta love em!
0812548094|5.0|Stone of Tears starts off quick, bringing you quickly back into Richard and Kahlans world before the first chapter is out. It picks up where the first book left off, and continues telling the exciting story, and picks it up a few notches. Everything in Stone of Tears is more extreme, the action, the plot, the dilemmas, and the romance. I cried when I read this book, and I can sit through anything Hollywood puts out without so much as wet eyes, but this book made me cry.<br />I'd consider it the best one out of the Sword of Truth series, closely followed by the first and the third in the series, which were both excellent as well. It sort of has something for everyone, its full of omens and portents, giving a thinker some foreshawdowing to work out, it has a fabulously written war sequence, battles between a small heartened army and a much larger force, it has romance to boot, and it is packed full of the stuff you loved from Wizards First Rule, magic, swordfighting, barriers to be overcome, and a cast of unforgetable characters that continues to grow, without too much recycling.<br />Plus, it has Gratch, and everyone loves Gratch. (I won't give too much away about Gratch, but he's very loveable)
B000001DTM|5.0|well i'm not a huge fan of this band, i don't really like any of their other recordings but damn this is just so good.  layers of sound fill every song, every listen uncovers something new. which is precisely what the other u2 albums lack, and why they bore after repeated listens. considering there are 265 reviews here w/ a 5-star average there's probably not too much i can add that hasn't been said by someone else.  so i will just say this: all the praise is deserved, if you don't have this album buy it right now!!
B000002KNI|5.0|The Concert In Central Park is the first and only Simon and Gargunkel album I have got so far. Whenever I am down and out I listened to this album and it gives me hope.<br />True that performance was not that fantastic showing their discord a bit. Particularly Mrs. Robinson was terrible indeed. It took some time before I recognize it was that Mrs. Robinson used for the Dustin Hoffman movie gThe Graduateh. But what made this concert memorable was that they struggled to close the gap one track after another. And the 500, 000 something audience demanded that and made that happen.<br />Particularly after the encore miracle did happen. Their harmony perfectly returned and the Sound of Silence showed their brilliant unison. The concert gave people all over the world bright hope and became essential part of New York history as some Woody Allen movies show.<br />It is essential part of American history as well.
B00005OAIE|5.0|There's no question that John Mayer is going to be around for a long time.I've been hearing so much about this New Artist that I had to buy &quot;Room For Squares.&quot; I love the first single,&quot;No Such Thing,&quot;also,&quot;Why Georgia,City Love&quot; and &quot;Neon,&quot; but after awhile,all of the 14cuts sound alike.Maybe one of these days I'll Cherish this CD,but not TODAY.
1559408898|3.0|The unrated director's cut really isn't that spectacular. I'd rather not see Murphy's hand disappear in a cloud of blood, or see some exec shot to hell 1000 times more than he should've been, or see a guy doused in toxic waste disintegrate on a car. Those things just aren't that special. <br />The commentary saves the disc though. It's a great track, one of Verhoeven's best. The storyboards are mediocre, the film-to-storyboard comparison is ok, and the illustrated making-of isn't much fun. <br />All in all, a classic movie that everyone should own. Expecially for it's satirical take on the Reagan era. But buy the regular version, don't waste your money on this DVD.
B000003CMB|5.0|Musical artists like The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin have great live records and were(some of them still are) the biggest live performers in Rock history. But this live record from The Allman Brothers Band is indeed the best live album ever recorded. If you seat back, relax and hear carefully the last 4 tracks you'll probably agree with me. From Blues to long jam moments of improvisation, this record is essential, not only for live music fans, but also(and above all) for everyone who really love pure Rock N'Roll! Genial!
0446608955|5.0|This book will give you faith in tru love. The two character show such chemistry its amazing. People like Jamie sullivan don't come often, and Landon Carter is about to find that out. This is a  true tear jerker. I have to say it has been a joy to read the book and watch the movie, so grab some tissues and sit down to listen the story of what love can do.
B000002KET|5.0|There are no words to describe this..... Just too awesome!!!
B000000OAN|5.0|I, of course, agree with everybody that this is Queen's best work and one of the top five albums released in the 20th century.  However, I would like to highlight three songs from that album that almost nobody talks about and are the ones that I still enjoy today as much as I did twenty years ago:  &quot;Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon&quot;, &quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot; and &quot;Good Company&quot;.<br />&quot;Lazing&quot; just shows how much you can do in under seventy seconds; beautiful choruses and an engaging guitar passage at the end.  &quot;Seaside&quot; has one of the craziest instrumental mid-sections; What are all the instruments they use in there?<br />Finally, &quot;Good Company&quot; not only show beauty and originality in the music side, but also has my favorite lyrics of the whole album.<br />There you go...    hopefully this review will make one or two people go back and listen to those songs again with fresh ears.  I'm sure you won't be dissapointed.   :-)
0689835604|5.0|My three month old loves this book! I thought my daughter would be too young for this book, but she is enraptured by the drawings of the babys. The colors are bold and stimulating, and the faces are adorable.<BR>I read this to her everyday, and she kicks with pleasure!<BR>This should definitely be on the must have list for new parents!
0553381709|5.0|Looking for a host of beautiful and invincible heroes and heroines? A rollicking, straightforward Good vs. Evil epic? Look elsewhere in the Fantasy section, then, because George R.R. Martin offers something rather unusual for his genre: a somewhat more (if you discount the black magic, etc.) realistic yarn that still manages to be a very, very good story. Be prepared to cringe, squirm, and genuinely fear (often with good cause) for a character's life. Also prepare for more of the major changes that have marked the previous books in A Song of Fire and Ice. And finally, prepare to set aside a chunk of time when you will not want your reading to be interrupted--and for the anticipation with which you will join those awaiting the next book in this incredible \\"fantastorical,\\" as Anne McCaffrey appropriately termed it.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|.....After listening to this soundtrack.  It's utterly amazing.  Even if you didn't enjoy the film, how could you not like the music!?!?  Everyone's heard the Lady Marmelade track, but Ewan McGregor's rendition of &quot;Your Song&quot; is utterly fantastic.  Who knew he could sing like that?!  There's at least one song on here that you are sure to love.  So, check it out.  And now, there's Volume 2 to satisfy your craving for more Moulin Rouge music!!
6305750750|1.0|A horrible, unnecessary waste of time, talent, and money. All of the special feature books and DVD extra features are not worth the price of having to sit through this painful exercise in patience. This is a mess -- period.
B0000025QC|5.0|As a fan of mostly R&amp;B, soul, jazz, and gospel I must say that this CD absolutely blew me away! It is a masterpiece! A compilation of some of the most intimate sounds my ears have ever come across. The ballads, are soft, and smooth making you feel as if you're alone in a sacred cave found in some exotic part of the world. I borrowed this CD from a girlfriend for a romantic weekend, and it was absolutely overwhelming. This CD is something I would take with me on my honeymoon or give as a gift to newly-weds.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Once again Michael Bay proves his lack of originality, following fellow Hollywood Action director James Cameron's footsteps and changing the pace from overrated, hype-driven action movies to make a sappy, over-budgeted, under-written, historical epic love drama.  This is truely a terrible film.  I guess you can't really call it \\"historical\\" since Bay addded plenty of \\"Hollywood\\" effects to the shocking surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Let's face it, this movie was not intended to be a \\"war\\" movie, the intention was to be a love drama.  But it failed terribly at achieving even that.  The love triangle drama was very unbelievable and \\"corny.\\"  Maybe the bad acting had something to with it, but it was not at all believable.  I cannot express how angry this film makes me.  It is a perfect example of what a ... movie is.  Bad directing, bad acting, a bad script, just overall bad.  I watched this with a group of friends and didn't really have a choice in what I was doing.  Don't make the same mistake as I did, don't waste precious hours of your important life, DEFINATELY don't spend money to buy this.  In all honesty, I HATE Hollywood movies, but if you're going to watch a war-related Hollywood drama, watch something like \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"  But if you want to watch some REAL war movies, watch Stanley Kubrick's \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and Francis Ford Coppela's \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"
078322804X|5.0|I love this movie. It is graced by the presence of Aretha Franklin and James Brown. It has great music, and is hillarious and fun<br />A CLASSIC!<br />It's 105 miles to Chicago. We got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses
0671027573|5.0|I stumbled onto Linda Howard after finishing ALL of Karen Robards' books. \\"Mr. Perfect\\" is HILAROUS, SEXY and downright ENVIABLE. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of suspensful romance...Jaine is every woman's hero, while Sam is every woman's hero as well. The sex is hot, the mystery...well, mysterious, and for that we should thank her for an easy combination. Bought the book as gifts for two friends. Ms. Howard, you have a new fan!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|First off, let me say that I'm relatively new to Maiden. This is the second album I've purchased, the first is Number of the Beast. I have of course also heard a significant portion of their other work.. :)<BR>In my opinion, this beauteous work of art is far superior to NotB (yes, GASP, I DARE to oppose the will of the swarm...). The supposed Maiden classic track (Hallowed by Thy Name) gets its little booty kicked far out of the window by Nomad, which is the best track on BNW. <BR>Yeah, anyways. <br />Wicker Man - a half decent track somewhat reminiscent of their earlier works. <br />Ghost of the Navigator - One of the less good tracks on the album, this is nonetheless amazing. It could stand being a minute or two shorter, however.<br />Brave New World - one of the best tracks on the album. The first three minutes are ungodly. <br />Blood Brothers - I'm not sure what to think about this. On one hand it kind of drags on in places, yet it never gets boring. If that makes sense to you, you must transfer your brain into my skull.<br />The Mercenary - Maybe it's just me but this track seems completely out of place with the rest of the somewhat mellow stuff on the album. Nonetheless it is still a good track.<br />Dream of Mirrors - This is a great track. My only gripe is that it drags on at the end, could be 2 minutes shorter and just as effective and more enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, I love long tracks...but in my opinion Maiden's not very good at holding interest when they start getting near 10 minutes (sorry). The <BR>Rime of the Ancient Mariner rules, however (as well as lots of other Maiden songs, as if you need to be told)..<br />The Fallen Angel - Similar to The Mercenary, I think this is a little better and is probably the most 'anthemic' (although I hate the very notion of 'metal anthems'...brings images of Manowar to my mind...*retch*). Or something like that. Yeah...<br />The Nomad - as I already mentioned, I think this is the best song on the album. It's theonly long song that doesn't drag on at all. The chorus is amazing, and the bass is just godlike. Overall an amazing song.<br />Out of the Silent Planet - Right up there with Brave New World and The Nomad, this is an amazing track. It could have been a little longer but perhaps then I would whine about how long it is... :)<br />The Thin Line Between Love and Hate - This song doesn't drag as much as The Mirror... but it does drag a little. It's still very good and overall a solid close to the album.<br />In conclusion, I feel this is a fine album that \\"MUST BE OWNED!...\\" by everyone. Or, more accurately, if you're into Maiden or 80's metal or even if you just think you might like this, I highly recommend it. It rules.
6305013578|1.0|Yes, Metropolis is a classic and is a wonderful film which I love.  I only wish when they made this DVD they would have used the restored version....  I remember seeing a restored version in the theatre, and not just the GM colorized rehash. So why didn't they use that one?  The resulting film is so fuzzy and out of focus it is almost unwatchable.<br />This is a great film, I only wish it had a decent DVD to go with it.
B000063JDE|5.0|Yes, I was a little disapointed that the deleted scenes were just filmographed stills to creepy music, but it seems insignificant when compared to what else this DVD offers.  Like a feature length documentary on this artistic but unpretentious, outworldy sick and strange but jovial guy and his best movie to date.  It's also funny to watch Ebert berate the movie while totally missing the point of the film, complaining about the violent sex scenes and disregarding the better, more significant aspects of the film.  For those who think Lynch's movies are a bit esoteric and experimental for your tastes, this is probably the most grounded with the most coherent style.  It's like they took an Ed Wood film and crossbred it elements of Salvador Dali and William S. Burroughs.  It's a lot more cohesive than Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive, but doesn't totally sap Lynch's style like Dune.  It's absurdly mysterious, disturbing, and gut wrenchingly hilarious all at the same time.  Definitely worth every penny.
B0000025T6|4.0|I can't listen to Springsteen very often or very long. His songs are too emotional and intense and after two or three of them, I push eject and go on to something a little more relaxing.  The sound of Nebraska, by comparison with most of his stuff, is mellow -- although the content of the songs is depressing.  With the exception of &quot;Atlantic City&quot; none of the tunes are great, but all in all it's a listenable CD of moderately good, frequently violent, mostly sad folk songs.
B000002HPV|5.0|... An incredible array of musical genres including classical,trip hop, and some of the most stunningly sonic progressive jungle I`ve ever heard. This is a showcase of her otherworldly voice and musical phrasing of her songs? (More like musical oddyseys or passages. More than anything else, this is Bjork`s CD of pure release. \\"All Neon Like\\"(sexual orgasmic release) \\"Alarm Call\\"(anger release)\\"Hunter\\"(basic instinct release) and so much more if you really listen to the lyrics(WHICH YOU REALLY SHOULD!) This is one of the greatest pieces of recorded music in the modern era!...
B000002U9Y|4.0|The first two floyd albums sound like someone listened to a whole lot of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; and &quot;Sgt Peppers...&quot;  (Syd).  However, I prefer that 2nd-generation Beatles material to the BOORRRINNGGG, over-rated 70's Floyd stuff.  What happened to this band is that a very talented -perhaps genius- song writer went insane, quit the band, and left the boring guys behind to put the rest of us to sleep for 20 years.
B00005LB50|4.0|Because of litigation that originated with one of the original members (it wasn't Neil Young), it appeared that there would never be a \\"Buffalo Springfield\\" box set and for some reason Atlantic never put their wonderful 2-album compilation from the early 70s on CD. The box set actually contains worthwhile written info (e.g., all their tour dates) and an only moderately whitewashed history of this contentious bunch. Historically, this is an important collection, because \\"Buffalo Springfield\\", along with \\"The Byrds\\" constitute the springboard for so much country-rock, folk-rock (& unfortunately icky \\"soft rock\\") that emerged in the late 60s and through the 70s. More than \\"The Byrds\\", though, there music emcompassed a wide range of influences from country to Latin. Yes, casual web surfer, there was alot more to these guys than the grossly overplayed \\"For What It's Worth\\".<br />Several things keep this from being a \\"five star\\": the alternate mix of \\"On the Way Home\\" lacks the instrumental vitality of the one that was released. The long version of \\"Bluebird\\", one of the few \\"legendary\\" long versions worth the time, is not included. This had appeared on the 70s compilation and its absence here makes no sense. Finally, there's little real live material. I was too young to see these guys live (I think I was in elementary school when they broke up), but many people say they that they were truly at their best live and songs like the previously released \\"long version\\" of \\"Bluebird\\" hint at this. Even a few less than perfect \\"bootleg\\" tapes would have been a nice addition (Neil Young has some and they've been played on various radio interviews with him).<br />Still & all, a valuable addition to any serious rock-n-roll collecetion & material you don't have to be a boomer to enjoy.

B00005JKJA|5.0|oh sweet sweet lord....this movie absolutely blew my mind to itty bitty pieces.  i dont even know where to start this review, but first of all..you should know that i am no David Lynch fanatic..in fact this is the first movie of his that i've seen so i can give you faithful reader a un-biased report of this MASTERPIECE.....  but be warned DO NOT under any circumstances buy this movie if you enjoy flicks such as Pearl Harbor, any Van Damme movie, or Crossroads (you get the idea) because i'll be the first to admit that i had absolutely NO idea what this movie was about after my first viewing.... when it ended i just kind of stared at the credits scrolling up the screen, jaw dropped, drool rolling down my chin...i had just recieved my first lobotomy.  i never gave up on the movie..i knew it could be figured out so i watched it 3 more times...still didnt get it....it was only after browsing through a magazine did i accidentally stumble upon an explanation for the movie.....  i wont give it away but after reading that article..the entire movie made sense..completely....right at that moment Mulholland Drive moved up the ranks in my \\"oh most favorite things the world\\" list... i swear to you people, the only reason this movie gets bad reviews is beacuse people dont understand it. seriously.  this isnt just a bunch of random scenes edited together....   <br />give this film a try...maybe you'll see the brilliance of this movie as well...<br />oh oh...i forgot to mention how terrible the actual DVD is....just the option to play the movie...no special features...no director commentary....not even a scene selection menu (i kid you not)  still a fantastic film though....
B00003CXI1|5.0|Well, most people have already made up their minds about this movie, whether they loved or hated it, but a few more thoughts here... For me, the picture did seem to be missing something--it didn't really grab me as much as I thought it would; seemed to be a bit lacking in emotional depth.  I didn't get the sense of how desperately unhappy Harry was to be living with his relatives, and what a relief it was for him to get the invitation to Hogwarts.  I'm not sure that's the fault of Daniel Radcliffe, though, since the film skipped over the first part of the book pretty rapidly... One section of the film that really DID work for me, emotionally, were the couple of scenes dealing with the Mirror of Erised--very nicely done, and rather touching.<br />Other plusses... The casting was very good, I thought.  I really liked both Ron and Hermione.  The Quidditch match was great--doesn't that look like fun?!  And Hogwarts was splendid, both inside and out.  How could I possibly resist all that mediaeval architecture?  Great to look at--and nearly all the interiors were shot at actual locations, in rooms hundreds of years old, not sets.  The music was very fitting as well--I'm not a big John Williams fan, but the main theme for this film was just perfect.<br />So, after seeing the picture several times my complaints have subsided--I do enjoy it!  It does lose a bit on the small screen--seeing it on the big screen, in six-channel sound,  is of course much more impressive than watching it on television.  (For instance, in several scenes if you looked closely you could always seen the figures in the paintings on the walls moving slightly--it's hard to notice that on the small screen.  And when the flying keys crashed into the closed door, they made a very deep THUD that you felt in your chest--you got a sense of how dangerous they were.  Lots of little details like that are lost on tv...)<br />Now, as far as the DVD presentation of the film itself goes, boy, what a DUD.  I honestly don't know what the people at Warners were thinking when they put this thing together.  There is almost no supplemental material at all--there was so much that could have been included, but wasn't.  No director's commentary, no in-depth behind the scenes material, no out-takes, no interviews with the child actors, NOTHING.  Disc two is almost entirely a sort of ... game/puzzle combination.  You have to do all sorts of tasks in the proper order to get to the stone and your reward, which is seven brief deleted scenes.  I don't know what age this is aimed at--certainly not adults, and not many kids either, I would think.  And the thing is, there is no way to get to those scenes directly through the menu--you have to go through the entire thing every time you want to see them.  Just stupidity...<br />However, there is a shortcut which others have mentioned.  I couldn't do this on my particular DVD player that is hooked up to the television, but it did work when I put the disc in the computer.  Bring up the track listings, and click on track 80.  Wait just a moment for the scene to change--when the row of bottles appears, click on the round one.  And that will take you to the deleted scenes.<br />A few of the scenes are interesting enough--problem is, there aren't many of them.  For instance, I know that there was some material shot with the Weasley family at the train station, but none of that was here.  What I would really have liked to see was a longer cut of the film, about three hours in length, with an intermission added.  That would have been perfect for viewing over two evenings, for those people who are pretty busy.  (I'm thinking of myself--by the time I finish working at about eleven every night, I'm too tired to watch a two and a half hour movie in one sitting anyway!)  The rough cut of this picture ran a whopping FOUR HOURS--there was plenty of material to work with, to put together a longer version.  So, I'm rather annoyed that the film wasn't lengthened,though perhaps someday another version will be available.  Still, I'm very glad I bought the disc to be able to view the film, or certain scenes, whenever I'm in the mood to do so.d, though perhaps someday another version will be available.

6304698542|3.0|Despite the mediocrity of picture and sound of this DVD edition, Cabaret still shines bright after forty years, both as musical entertainment and social commentary. It depicts as accurately as any other document the contradictions and conflicts of German (and European) society during the rise of Nazism, the hedonistic atmosphere and decadence of the early thirties, an attitude of life that helped mask the menace of Hitler that was about to engulf Europe and the world. Thoroughly entertaining, enjoyable, and frightening.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles. One of the greatest if not THE greatest bands of all time. Of all the many greatest albums of some of the best bands of the time such as; The Beatles' Abbey Road, Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, Led Zeppelin 4, Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon, Santana's Abraxas, or The Who's Tommy, which one was the best? Of course Abbey Road, although the afformentioned albums by the other artists and bands are widely considered their greatest, (not to make the other bands mad) Abbey Road blows them all out of the water!<br />Combining the Outstanding musicianship of John, Paul, George and Ringo, the great production, orchestration, and technical genius of longtime producer George Martin, the great keyboard work of Billy Preston on \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\", \\"Come Together\\", \\"Sun King\\", & \\"Something\\", a bunch of leftover songs from various recording sessions from over the years, and a couple of Moog Synthesizers and a White Noise Machine and what do you get? The Beatles' greatest album, Abbey Road. Comprised of 17 songs.<br />Come Together- The perfect kick off to the greatest album in the world. John Lennon's giberrish-laden masterpiece.<br />Something- George Harrison's love song to then-wife Patti Boyd sister of Mick Fleetwood's wife Jenny Boyd, future wife of Eric Clapton (George's best friend who loved Patti since 1968).<br />Maxwell's Silver Hammer- Sir Paul's funny piano ballad about a serial killer. This song is so strict he even has Ringo overdub himself smashing an anvil with a hammer. Synthesizers a la mo.<br />Oh! Darling- Another Piano-Laden Love Song by Paul McCartney. This song was asked of my George Martin, because he wanted a revival of the kind of songs that they did in 1964.<br />Octopus's Garden- Ringo's 2nd tune about the sea (the first was Yellow Submarine). Also a nice kid's tune. Nice guitar work by George Harrison.<br />I Want You (She's So Heavy)- John Lennon's song about an intense woman who blows his mind (possibly Yoko!). But does the woman blow John's mind enough that they had to do a continuous instrumental passage with Moog White Noise. John Lennon was good in cutting the tape right at 7:42, because that is the threshold of sanity for most humans. But as you know, for a time John thought that he was Jesus Christ so he is different than us humans.<br />Here Comes The Sun- George Harrison's song about spiritual rebirth, beautifully represented by the sun as rising again after a time of solemn depression, or long cold winter as represented in the song. Also a good love song if your reconciling to a woman. Great Moog-action during the bridge.<br />Because- John Lennon's dull lyricized harpsichordy ode to how LSD will kill the brain. Multiple harmony overbud by all four guys. More heavy synthesizers.<br />You Never Give Me Your Money- Paul's Greed. 1234567 All Good Beatles Go to Heaven.<br />Sun King- The start of the 1st of the Famous 2 Medleys of Abbey Road. Much Spanish Gibberish!<br />Mean Mr. Mustard- John's Tribute To Crazy Dirty Grumpy Old Men.<br />Polythene Pam- 60's dance ode to an attractively built girl who dresses in a polythene bag at a party.<br />She Came In Through The Bathroom Window- Paul's Love song to Linda Eastman his new bride at the time (God Rest Her Soul). Though Paul was never a cop and Linda was never an exotic dancer.<br />Golden Slumbers- The start of the 2nd medley of Abbey Road. Another Sir Paul love song to Linda, but this time he wrote a nice piano tune.<br />Carry That Weight- OK, We Want To Reprise \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", and have our 40-piece orchestra sing \\"Boy You Gotta Carry That Weight, Carry That Weight A Long Time\\" as the chorus.<br />The End- Guitar solo jam by John, Paul, and George. Then the famous line, \\"And in The End, The Love You Take is Equal To The Love You Make.\\" Nice end, but that's just not it yet for another 40 seconds.<br />Her Majesty- (Crash!) Her Majesty's a pretty Nice girl but she doesn't have alot to say. Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl but she changes from day to day. I Want to tell her that I love her alot, but I gotta get a belly full of wine. Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl some day I'm gonna make her mine, Oh Yeah!, Some Day I'm Gonna make her mine.<br />(in the time it took me to type that I would have played \\"Her Majesty\\" 17 times)<br />Hopefully a nice review song-by-song about the best Beatles Album if not best album ever. Buy it in any version (CD, Cassestte, or Vinyl [i'd prefer Vinyl] ), you will love it, I promise.tty nice girl but she changes from day to day.

A friend lent me the &quot;book on CD&quot; so I'd have something to do while driving my daughter, age 14, to a volleyball tournament.  Both my daughter &amp; I listened to the book and both of us found it tedious and not even vaguely representative of the female psyche, certainly not ours.  If there's an interest in delving into the psyche of an extremely shallow and self-absorbed young woman, and it appears there is, then this is the book for them.  Funny, I did not find it.
B000065V1V|4.0|Yet again Bowie gives us another great album! Is this the best album Bowie has ever done? Hell no! But it's easily the best since 1987's &quot;never let me down&quot;. I've been a fan since forever, and the thing that i love about him is you never know what the next album is going to sound like, or even the next song on each album. Some people would mark this up as Bowie trying to keep up with the times or something but i'll tell you what it is, it's a genious writing what he wants to to please himself and not becoming stagnant. I'm not crazy about everything he has done but i give great respect to him for not doing &quot;suffragette city&quot; over and over again. &quot;Araid&quot; is my favorite on the album, a good rocker that keeps the head bobing. &quot;5:15 the angels have gone&quot; is put together incredibly with this drum part that is so out of place yet works so well that you have to think &quot;this guy is amazing&quot;. If you want nsync style mtv music, don't buy this. If you want the latest fad limp bizcuit rap metal, don't buy this. If you looking for old Bowie standards like &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; or &quot;Changes&quot;, don't buy this. If you are a true Bowie fan or want an album that is exceptionally written and is a real joy to listen to, BUY THIS ALBUM. I don't believe Dave is getting older, i think he's getting better.
0140277447|5.0|This is a fact that many people including historians do not realize. This book is not to insult the Japanese. It is to call upon the Japanese to face the painful truth and apologize for its brutal actions against the Chinese people, the allies and other Asian nations. Japan has a lot to apologize for other most obviously for sparking WW2 in the Pacific by invading Asia and attacking Pearl Harbor. Many books that expose Japanese atrocities are to be read by people who are curious of forgotten chapters in history.<br />I highly reccomend this book.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump), Castaway is the story of Chuck Noland, a man who lives his life by the clock, doing his job as a courier, whose life is changed when a plane trip to see his family turns into a struggle for survival. Tom Hanks reunites with director Zemeckis after Forrest Gump and gives another amazing performance, alongside his co-star, Wilson, a vollyball that gets washed up in the wreckage from the plane crash. And this is where Hanks' brilliant performance shows, with the slowly building friendship that Chuck has with his vollyball buddy.<br />Zemeckis' direction is strong and well-handled when events are on the island; witness Chuck's discovery of the dead pilot, his attempts to start a fire, and a truly wincing moment where he does some DIY dentistry. The fact that Hanks can hold his own as the only guy on the island for two hours (albeit with Wilson) is a true testimony of his unique talent.<br />The problem is, once the film gets to the end, events get tiresome, where we are greeted with far too much exposition , and after a while, you start to get somewhat weary of the over-wrought sentiment. But it's at sea where the magic is, and despite it's flaws, it is an impressive adventure.
0060920084|2.0|I had read &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; and loved it.  So much so, that all my family members got it as a Christmas gift.  On recommendation of a classmate, I checked this book out from the library.  Thank god I didn't buy it.  It took me forever to read.  Mostly because he was just plain mean.  I kept picking it up, thinking that it was going to get better.  NO.  If you aren't into this book within the first 50 pages, your not going to enjoy it.
B00003Q438|4.0|Did you ever watch a movie that has top-notch performances, great action and awesome special effects, but the whole thing nearly gets ruined by the cop-out ending? Well, if you've seen Mission to Mars, you know what i'm talking about. James Cameron's underwater thriller The Abyss is a taut, supensful film with all the aformentioned plus points but is let down by the bog standard ending which, to be blunt, screams \\"Close Encounters rip off!\\" The problem is, that it's one trick that Cameron can't pull off. The etheral ending is bizzare for a man who unleashed the brutal and terrifying Terminator and Aliens.<br />But the plus points do make it worthwhile, with action aplenty and a series of gripping set-pieces that enthrall every time.  And the huge amount of extra features on the DVD is impressive, with trailers, T.V spots, a feature \\"Multi-Story Option\\": where you can select original theatrical release (145 min.) or special edition release with 28 minutes of added footage, plus a video<br />subscripture Version: Viewers can read pop-up captions throughout the film explaning how the special effects were created.  Documentary: Under pressure: Making The Abyss (60 min.) with cast and crew interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. Not quite five stars, but it's worth it.

B000062TU1|4.0|I saw this movie twice on the big screen and I'd have to say that I enjoyed it even more when I viewed it on the small screen.  The home theatre feels more cosy somehow.<br />It is a beautifully rendered version of a wonderful book.  With incredible detail added to build up the world Harry inhabits.  Most cast members seem tailor-made for their parts.  Unlike at the theatre, it's relatively long running time was no hardship with the option of &quot;pause&quot; and as a great admirer of the book, I couldn't help but wish for even MORE SCENES to expand on the story.  The only &quot;flaw&quot; in this version for some reviewers was a lack of major, earthmoving plot points, but for this fan of the Harry Potter series of books, it was a faithful, loving and respectful telling of the story.  And a movie that I think I will enjoy viewing many times.<br />The second disk which offers additions is much, much less than I had hoped for and a serious disappointment.  The tour of Hogwarts and Hagrid's cottage is cheesy graphics, fuzzy and just not up to any respectable standards.  The 'games' are simplistic and pointless.  And once played, never a challenge again, even for little kids.  In a movie offering such beautiful attention to detail, I would have expected more (from the extras) and would rather had have more out-takes from the film than just the seven scenes offered.  The only worthwhile part of this disk is the rather extensive interviews with Chris Columbus and several of the other artists responsible for making this movie.  I understand that there are more features available with a CD ROM, but we were not able to view those, so I don't have any comments on what they might add to this disk.<br />So 5 stars for the movie and 2 stars for the extras from this reviewer.
B0000640VM|3.0|I must say that Oliver &amp; Company is a pretty hip movie about a cat finding a gang of dogs to hang with.  The story and music are good, but I felt that this movie was just a little too short.  It needed more footage and a little more action as well.  Overall, this is a movie that everyone should see once or twice.

If you enjoyed Enter the Dragon, you should also enjoy Game of Death.

I have enjoyed watching this movie since my childhood and it never fails to entertain me. The new DVD version has great extras! Everyone should own Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Kids and adults will love this film.
B000000WFZ|5.0|Ennio Morricone is without a doubt, one of the best composers of this era.  He has written fantastic music, reminiscent of the masters of classical music, with a modern theme. The Mission is, in my opinion, the best of all his works.  Gabriel's Oboe was something else and the the musical arrangements of all the other songs were superbly done.  Although the movie was a good one, the music was much better than the movie itself.  Ennio wrote other great scores like Cinemal Paradiso and the Love Affair, but, the Mission is still his best work ever. The only other great film scorer of our time is John Williams but the Mission soundtrack is better than any of Williams works. Buy this one!
B00005N5S5|5.0|I think this is one science fiction film that will never get old.  The Terminator is definately Arnold's smash hit movie.  Michael Biehn did a good job playing Kyle Reese as well.  This movie is in no way boring and is a guarenteed  edge-of-your-seat thriller.  The DVD has good features but extended scenes in the actual film would have been nice, too.  Even though Terminator 2 is as good if not better than The Terminator, I still think this movie is one of the best!
B00005RFVL|5.0|I am a huge Robbie fan. But this particular album is nothing like his others.<br />It has a distinct and nostalgic feel. All of the remakes of old Frank Sinatra and Dean Martain songs are completely brilliant. I love the big-band feel of the album. If you like Robbie or swing music, this album is a must. <br />Also, a cute touch that I love are the cute little skits in between songs. There are so many cameo's from Nicole Kidman, to Rupert Everett and Robbie's best friend. <br />This is a exquisite sounding and timeless album...
1558908455|4.0|This is one of those really good movies that has an excellent plot twist right in the middle of it.  What starts out as an action-thriller turns into a vampire gore fest.  I think that the film for the most part was very well done.  However, I found that the excessive amount of profanity in the film was really offensive and that's why I only give it 4 stars.  Every time I see a movie with George Clooney, I always remember him as Seth Gecko because that's the role that I think suited him best.  It's too bad that he didn't return in From Dusk Till Dawn 2.
6303965415|5.0|...and even when &quot;Persuasion&quot; first came out, I watched it three times in the movie theater.  It is like reading any Jane Austen novel -- no matter how many times you read one, you can reread it and enjoy it all over again...and again.  It is amazing to watch Amanda Root as Anne actually bloom -- you can even see the color come back to her cheeks when she gets to Lyme and gets a taste of the sea air.  Even the problems I used to have with this adaptation have worn away:  I didn't like the way they tried to incorporate both the unfinished 10th chapter and the final version of the novel with Capt. Wentworth's confronting Anne about her supposed engagement...but now I like seeing the opportunity to have the Captain and Lady Russell confront each other; I didn't like the way Anne rushes to Capt. Wentworth in front of the whole concert audience as they watch...but now I like seeing just how little she cared about others' opinions and how impulsive she becomes toward the end of the movie; I didn't like how they emphasize Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Clay's complicity...but now after thinking about it, this *is* implied strongly in the novel.  One of the best parts of the movie, however, are the significant looks exchanged between Anne and Capt. Wentworth -- one of the best happening when Anne is discussing love and loss with Capt. Benwick.  It is so subtle but so heavy with meaning.  It is not so surprising to me to find out that both Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds have acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company as they both do superb jobs here.
0060920084|2.0|As a European who lived and travelled in the States some years ago, I must say that I was surprised by the very limited number of human contacts Bryson made while travelling through small-town America. He seems to be spending all his time driving alone, eating alone (fast food which he abhors) and sleeping alone, in a country rightly famous for the ease with which you can make new acquaintances.He makes no new friends, never gets invited into a local's  house, casual conversation is minimal. Compared to his Aussie book (Down Under) which is rich in hilarious dialog, this one is almost 100% descriptive. If I am not mistaken, this is one of Bryson's first books which is perhaps the reason why his writing technique is not as good as in his later works. Nevertheless, if you are a Bryson fan, by all means buy this book!

B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie's return to the US started with her appearance at the Closing of the Olympics. I was grateful to see her parading around in her sexy outfits, just the way I remembered her when last seen on MTV (when it used to play music videos) in the late 80's. Since then I've collections a few of her albums and found them tolerable. With Fever, she shines like never before. So with age she's become sexier! More entertaining! It's good to see someone getting better with age.
B000002KDG|5.0|RUST NEVER SLEEPS is NEIL YOUNG'S second masterpiece right behind HARVEST. This is a live album that had the audience     mixed out. This album also shows Neil at his best. One part of the album is acoustic that second part is Neil rocking with his longtime backing band CRAZY HORSE. The album starts off with the acoustic classic MY MY, HEY HEY(OUT OF THE BLUE), and ends with the same song HEY HEY, MY MY(INTO THE BLACK) the same song that sound so different. THRASHER, RIDE  MY LLAMA, POCAHONTAS, and SAIL AWAY are acoustic classics that show Neil going back to his folk, country roots. After that song,we are treated to a blistering, thunderous, rocking workout starting with POWDERFINGER followed by WELFARE MOTHER, SEDAN DELIVERY and ending with the title track. My personal favorites on this album are POWDERFINGER, POCAHONTAS and both versions of the title track. Neil has never been an artist that is afraid to experiment with how he sounds and sometimes  he gives us great music, sometimes he fails, but he keeps trying. This is possibly one of the greatest rock albums of all time and it deseves to be in your CD collection at home. PEACE
0790729652|5.0|The acting, story, and Danny Elfman score in this film were all very well done. Jack Nicholson gives a smashing performance as the Joker while Michael Keaton takes the lead as Batman. Even though the sequels were good, this movie still stands alone as the #1 Batman motion picture of all time. I feel that the last two Batman films would have been better if Tim Burton had stayed on the project along with Michael Keaton keeping the role of Bruce Wayne.
0446677450|2.0|While most individuals give this book a great review I've read the entire book and it gives common sense suggestions that an average person should have already thought off. On top of that the book itself has over 40 misspelled words and has so many blank spots that if you where to take out the blank spots in the book it would only have been around 100 to maybe 125 pages and I certainly would not have paid the asking price for it maybe I would have considered paying half the price asked. <BR>As well as the fact that the authors are definitely pushing through the entire book, &quot;financial education&quot; by buying books well excuse me the authors are in the business of selling books. I've left this book with 2 thoughts:<BR>1. He has a Rich Dad and a Poor Dad<BR>2. Buy Books (and whose books do you think) because you didn't get much info in this book. They make you want to buy others so you can learn from them how to do it supposedly.<BR>Well I have yet to find anything here that is new to a high-risk investor already in the game.<BR>Good luck if you choose to read this book, as it's frustrating to read a book that the authors didn't even take the time to proofread.
B000065U1N|3.0|I was so much looking forward to getting this movie on DVD so I could see it for the first time--it looked really good and most critics spoke very highly of it. Ironically, while I was in soldering class, we got to watch the History Channel documentary about Black Hawk Down. The day the movie came out on DVD my company got to see it as part of our EO training--and since I'd seen the documentary I knew much better what the film was about. <br /> To be brief, the movie, unfortunately, gives very little background as to how this whole thing started. And once it does start, it doesn't stop. Like most guys, sure, I like action scenes, but when you're sitting there watching guys for about two hours going &quot;I'm up, they see me, I'm down, rat-a-tat-tat&quot; it gets rather boring, whether it's historical or not. <br /> Even worse, though, was the character development. When an American soldier died I was like, &quot;Well, there's goes another one&quot; (since I didn't know their names). <br /> To wrap things up, I'll just say this--the History channel's documentary did everything better. <br />Leave action to Hollywood. But leave history to the History Channel.

B00003CX9Q|2.0|This movie intellectual level doesn't surpass the one of a third grader. Characters are all one dimensional. Scripting is higly predictable and filled with clichees.

B0000667RO|4.0|I learned about that CD couple months ago, before it was released in the United States. I've been looking for it even in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame And Museum, with no results. Now, it finally came out 3 years after the United Kingdom's release of this compilation in 1999.<br />It's a good compilation because it has a retrospective point of view on the Adams' career. However, the album supposed to be 'the best of' Bryan, and it's missing some other great songs that definitely should be here: Do I Have To Say The Words?, Heaven, Somebody, and Kids Wanna Rock.<br />'The Best Of Me' suprisingly (NOT) includes 3 excellent songs from the album '18 'Til I Die' which was considered by some critics to be the falldown of Bryan Adams as a singer. They should rather consider the album \\"Into The Fire\\" which doesn't have any song included on that CD, even though it was a good one anyway.<br />The album also have finally available song \\"All For Love\\" which was only available before on the soundtrack to the movie \\"The Three Muskeeters\\" starring Kiefer Shuterland, Oliver Platt, and Rebecca De Mornay besides others.<br />The booklet includes lyrics to the all of the songs.<br />Basically, it's a very good compilation to buy. However, let's hope for really 'the best' in the future.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever produced.  Achtung Baby served to reinvent one of the world's greatest bands and propel them to even higher levels of stardom in the 1990s.  From the distorted beginnings of &quot;Zoo Station&quot; to the haunting conclusion of &quot;Love is Blindness&quot; there isn't a weak song on the album.  If you want to hear U2 at its best this and The Joshua Tree are to two albums you need to hear.  Achtung Baby is a must for every serious rock fan.

B000009QO6|4.0|Glenn Danzigs new project after Samhain and Misfits finds him on a new venue, moving from punk and into the rockabilly-bluegrass-metal style. Danzigs vocal on Danzig sounds like an unholy mix of Elvis Presley and Jim Morrison. Danzig is using his vocal range much better than he did earlier, just listen to his diabolical low voice in Soul on Fire and End of Time. This album also include his (later) hit Mother.<BR>All in all a very promising debut from Danzig. The music is a great mix. Danzigs &quot;unholier than thou&quot; attitude is entertaining, and I doubt many people take it seriously, exept fundemental christian groups(and maybe Glenn himself), but it is none the less an entertaining part of the act, adding to the atmosphere of the album.
B000001FS3|5.0|It is a cliche, but words cannot do justice to this album.  It is perfect.  I could have it on infinite loop and never tire of it.  The Joshua Tree simply is the greatest album ever produced.  From the building crescendo of &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;; to the deep spirituality of &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;; to the desperate longings of &quot;With or Without You&quot;; to the bold and charging indictments of &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;; to the sad addictions of &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot;; to the haunting conclusion of &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot;; every song rings with the absolute truth of a band who has discovered the perfect pitch of their ultimate voice.  No serious U2 fan can go without this album.  It is the best of one of the world's greatest bands.

0440219078|5.0|Imagine you live in a bubble.  Things can't get in, like pain, loneliness and misery.  But neither can pride, love and joy.  Lois Lowry has created a world where this is everyone's lifestyle.  In The Giver, people don't choose to live this way, they just do.  A boy called Jonas peacefully lives like this until he meets the Giver, who makes little holes in his bubble letting in the once forbidden emotions and feelings.<BR> Jonas is pretty content with his life.  He lives with his mother, father and sister Lily.  He's got two good friends Asher and Fiona. Even his father got permission to have a baby called Gabe live with them until he must live with different parents. Sure, he has to follow strict rules, must take pills to get rid of \\"stirrings\\" can't lie, must have the \\"right\\" life a child should have, and can't ask questions regarding any differences between two people (it would be rude, after all).  But to him, people have been following these strict rules forever.<BR> But time is suddenly spiraling very close to the Ceremony of Twelve where his lifelong job will be assigned to him.  For everyone else it seems so obvious what they'll be.  But for Jonas?  Nothing's really fitting for him.  When the time finally arrives,  Jonas is assigned, or more, selected to be the new Receiver of Memory, a job he didn't even know existed.  His responsibility as the new receiver is to take memories of living, really living from the  old Receiver, who will pass that name to Jonas and become the Giver. <BR> Jonas is suddenly revealed to a whole new world.  Snow, sleds, sunsets, tranquility, sunshine, flowers, colors, families and most importantly, love.  But the Giver must now show him why all that was left behind and a concept that they have lived with so long called Sameness replaced it.  He must show Jonas the fear, the loneliness, the pain.  But even with a terrifying memory of war, Jonas is not defeated, or even down.  He now knows what he must do, especially after a horriblerealization and truth about a childhood question.  He knows he must free these memories, giving everyone the chance to live a real life, destroy Sameness and save an innocent baby's  life.<BR> When we first step into Jonas's life, nothing really makes sense.  You're always asking yourself, \\"what did they mean by that?\\"  It has sort of a strange feel.  For example, the word animal is no longer a noun, they were taken away.  It's an adjective only.  This is a little passage of the book where Jonas is talking to Lily. `\\"They acted like....\\" \\"Animals?\\" suggested Jonas.  Neither child knew what the word meant, exactly, but it was often used to describe someone uneducated or clumsy, someone who didn't fit in.'<BR> A proverb that comes to mind with this is \\"Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.\\"  Because in the book it shows those of us that wish for a perfect life should see what that could do to us.  Lois Lowry gives you the power to believe what happens next.  In an intentional clever way, the book is a bit vague at points, letting you ask yourself what should be there and what it means.  For example, throughout the book, there is a mysterious concept of \\"release\\" a great punishment for some, and a huge reward for others.  But for awhile it's just a gray area that you can use a dark pencil to put in what you want there.  <BR> Nearing the end, the rapidness slows down a little, but only enough to really understand what's going on fully, unlike the other parts where its always 2 feet ahead of you.  The very end gets  a little blurry, but so does Jonas's mind which makes us feel like we've been brought alone with him.  And the conclusion is up to you on how things should end.  <BR>   The Giver can be sci-fi or fantasy, depending on how you read it.  It's for a person who likes thoughtful books that make you think and don't end when you've read the last word of the last chapter and continues in your head for days.  But it's also for people where that's the last kind of book they want, and what they do want is an exciting, want-to-jump-into-the-text feeling while reading the book.  And people in between?  Of course!  This book is ideal for any 12 and up.  Looking at you perspective on life a little differently can never be outgrown, so this is a fascinating book for adults as well as kids.
B00006690F|4.0|I'm listening to it right now, and I love it, but can't explain why.  There is a part of all of us that likes to see an automobile accident, or enjoys the voyeuristic look into someone else's miserable, dramatic life.  Emniem is a narcissist.  He glories in his foul mouth.  Emniem is also entertaining, and is surprisingly self-aware.  He doesn't take himself seriously, despite his sometimes angry tone.<br />My favorite tracks are:  White America, Business, Soldiers, Hailie's Song, and Till I Collapse, a duet with Dr. Dre.<br />I think Hailie's Song is a perfect example of the contrasting elements of this song.  Hailie's Song is Emniem very lamely trying to sing about his joy in gaining custody of his daughter.  He flat acknowledges that he can't sing worth a nickel, but goes on doing it because he is so happy.  Mixed inside this gem is lots of enchanting banter.  You'll find yourself asking, \\"This is that same punk that thinks the whole world is imitating him?\\"<br />Anyway, if you can tolerate rap music, then this is worth the [money] to own it.  If you already are an Emniem fan, you undoubtedly bought this CD/DVD combo already, and have been bumping around with it for days now.  If John Denver is an icon for you, then you might not want to pick this up.  [....]
B00004WGAI|4.0|I read the novel only a short while ago and decided to check out a few film versions.  I was very impressed with Dalton's portrayal of Mr. Rochester.  It was just as I had imagined him, except of course, as many seem to also think, he just looked too handsome.  And I loved the fact they were quite faithful to the marvelous dialogue in the book.  <br />The only real problem I had with it, and I think it took away from how much I liked it, was Jane.  I just found myself unable to see her as I had seen her in the book.  She was supposed to be young, timid and shy, but at the same time bold and definat.  Clarke's too soft voice and her often expressionless face- she had a perpetual, almost annoying frown.  In addition, her lack of expression was a sharp contrast to Dalton's almost theatrical (even if overrdone) performance.  In addition, she was too much shorter than him and not nearly lithe enough or fairy-like to be Jane.  She wasn't an &quot;unearthly thing&quot; at all, she was too prudish and grounded.  Her awful costumes didn't help any.<br />But not too complain too much.  I suppose the real enjoyment is to read the book and imagine your own Jane and Mr. Rochester.  I liked seeing this version though.  It was a lot better than the 1997 one.  I've yet to see the Orson Welles one.
0790729628|5.0|Blade Runner (director's cut) has to be my favorite movie; it's special effects and setting are still visually stunning after 20 years, plus the breathtaking soundtrack and story make it a feast for the senses. Very few films can stand the test of time this well, and I cannot gush about this movie enough. It is a work of art.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|This soundtrack (which is actually more of a score) does an amazing job of carrying the feeling of the movie into a C.D., but it leaves a lot to be expected. <BR>  The C.D. features some of the main songs from Moulin Rouge, such as &quot;Come What May&quot;, &quot;Elephant Love Meledy&quot;, and &quot;Your Song&quot;, but it also leaves some of the best songs out. Instead it adds songs that were only in the movie for a few seconds (a good example is &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; by Beck; about four words of it were sung in the dance sequence at the Moulin Rouge that featured Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;) where others like the Green Fairy's rendition of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; could have been featured. I would also have liked to have heard the end version of &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; and possibly more versions of &quot;Come What May&quot;.<BR>  Despite the lack of some of the movies best songs (there's a second Moulin Rouge soundtrack out that slightly makes up for what the original lacks), Moulin Rouge is a very good C.D., and I strongly reccomend buying it!
B00005JKBC|4.0|I don't know why anyone would consider Tom Clancy's stories set in reality. Most of his stories have far more Hollywood like qualities than this movie. <BR>The acting was great. The story riveting and intense. It is a movie worth watching a few times.

B000002AGN|5.0|This is going to be one sappy review so be forewarned.<br /><br />This album is the Big Bang of Jazz. Every note, every tune, every musician came together via the event horizon; however, on this star crossed date, the light shown was via the magnificent and glorious album.<br /><br />With every listen, I come up with a new favorite tune: &#34;Strange Meadow Lark&#34; (living in the west conjures notions of a tuneful frolicking bird devouring bugs). To &#34;Kathy's Waltz&#34; a joyful tune in its own right. &#34; Blue Rondo &agrave; la Turk&#34; with the jibe and vibe and notion of an ancient middle eastern marketplace. &#34;Pick up Sticks&#34; is a perfect rendition, to me of the classic childs game. Every time I hear this tune I think of the game. &#34;Everybody's Jumpin'&#34; is a tune that captures a party where everyone is relishing friendship and conversation. &#34;Take Five&#34; is the tune that encapsulates the spirit of Jazz and the vibrancy of the music: The coup de grace, if you will.<br /><br />The music on this compact disc (LP in my day--speaking of a death blow), hit me as analogous as a two by four across the forehead: A life changing event. This album is responsible for my absolute love of progressive, melodic music: Jazz.<br /><br />The music on this album is incredible--the human language does not have the words adequate to convey the impact. I only ask that you place the mother of pearl side down onto the spindle and simply listen. In my opinion this is the best Jazz album of ALL time.<br /><br />As vile as this pretentious acclamation sounds to the elite of Jazz--all I ask of all is to listen. Listen to &#34;Kathy's Waltz&#34;. Listen to &#34;Strange Meadowlark&#34;. The contained selections (if you have 'listened'), will instill upon you why Jazz, particularly this album of Jazz, is at the pinnacle.<br /><br />I have written a few reviews here at Amazondot com yet I took my time writing this review. I must say the words escape me: I ask you to LISTEN: Nevertheless I cannot write an adequate review but I perceive.ive.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Being the sort of person who is strongly allergic to hype, I've stayed well clear of the whole 'Harry Potter' phenomenon up til now. Great, another overwrought kids book full of silly names, and bratty child heroes. But, when my roomie came home with the DVD, my curiosity got the best of me and in the dark of night I smuggled the disk up to my room and into my player.<BR> <BR> And was instantly hooked! On it's own, I found the film to have just the right mix of humor, warmth, and yes...magic. The heroes aren't bratty at all, but loveable, with just the right touch of vulnerability to make you care for them. Even the female lead, who all too often in these sorts of films is either bratty, or in need of rescuing every five minutes, manages to hold her own with the boys. <br /> The special effects are fine, and the cast of seasoned actors seems to be quite enjoying themselves. The script is quite charming, with all the great touches of british wit that make their fantasy stories seem so charming. I haven't had this much fun since my younger days of watching Doctor Who.  Add to that the youthful enthusiasm of Speilburgs early films and you have quite the winning combination.<br /> Like most everyone else though, I have to take one star off for the DVD itself. I certainly have no problem with a disk full of games and the like to keep the kids entertained, but I had hoped that there'd be a bit more meat on the disk for us serious movie fans. More deleted scenes, a proper commentary, that sort of thing. I can only hope that at some point, WB will grace us with a Special Edition set for us older viewers.<br /> I'm not sure I'm ready to join the long line of rugrats haunting the Waldenbooks to buy the books. But for the $... HP is a real bargain, and a must-have title for the fantasy lover, or those who just want to feel like a kid again.
B0000630BT|4.0|didn't like the priest much when I was younger - preferred metal that was either harder (slayer) or more psychedelic (sabbath) - and so, 12 years after it appeared, I finally picked up 'painkiller.' this is the work of seasoned professionals responding to the evolution of their genre and demonstrating that, in their way, they were still masters of it. \\"painkiller\\" melds the traditional anthemic and relatively pop approach of priest with some over-the-top crushing thrash (something I never associated with this group - thinking of the restrained minimalism of  \\"breaking the law\\" or the hardy kiss-isms of \\"living after midnight\\" and then listen to the title track). it is still cheesy at times, but there is some great guitar-playing, great songwriting, and some very brutal drumming here. although these guy's had been around for close to 20 years when they cut this disc, it sounds absolutely contemporary.<br />on another note, it's hard not to listen to this record with the hindsight provided by rob halford's departure and his \\"revelations\\" concerning his sexual orientation. in the context of these events, \\"touch of evil\\" and the bonus \\"living bad dreams\\" give voice to the homo-eroticism that metal has always harbored but fanatically repressed. in the same vein, \\"leather rebel\\" describes a revolutionary and incendiary heroism that contradicts the straight-world's demeaning caricatures of gay life.<br />bottom line: these leather boys are rock hard and ready to ram it down. are you?
B00005R23Z|3.0|i didn't think this movie was all that. the first 40 minutes of it were good, but then it degraded to a cracked out version of les miserable with the hardcore investigator bent on catching the lower-cast. i also thought the moral of the story was a bit ironic in that the main character, although persecuted throughout the whole movie, wound up wanting to go into the stars, which was comprised of even more people who consisted of the same people that persecuted him. also, i thought the swimming race between two adults was a bit stupid...
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|The Vista Series has released the biggest and greatest DVD package ever assembled with \\"Pearl Harbor- The Director's Cut.\\" The new 184 Minute cut is edited better. The attack sequence is more realistic and graphic, the reason for this cut's R-rating. And the four-disc set features hours of behind-the-scenes footage, two documentaries on the real attack and the Doolittle Raid, and commentary tracks from Michael Bay and Janine Basinger; Jerry Brucheimer, Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Alec Baldwin; The Director of Photography, Costume Designer, Visual Effects Supervisor and Composer. A great addition to the DVD collection. And if you think this is good, then get ready for the November release of \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring- The Director's Edition\\" four-disc set! Movie Grade: A+; DVD Grade: A+
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing the track &quot;Don't know why&quot; and have never been so happy with a new artist as I was in finding this one.<BR>Norah is definitely haunting, and contrary to comments that she is somehow shallow or too slow, the slow tracks are extremely moving.Listen to the words, feel the melancholy and enjoy it. Come away with me is inspiring... to do just that; ask someone to go away with you; hear &quot;I've got to see you again&quot; and feel the need to see someone again - just because you can't get them out of your head - listen to &quot;The Long day is over&quot; and apply that thought to life and love<br />It has been an incredible few weeks of listening to her. I am greatly anticipating her next albums and am trying to locate concerts.It's worth your money (however hard it was to earn) especially if you are a passionate person and want to lose yourself in songs that touch the heart.
B000002KAT|4.0|So much do the critics like Astral Weeks that a lot of them consider it one of the top 10, and in a few cases, best, albums ever.  Over time, many in the public, whose response did not make the album a good seller when it was released, came to show at least some agreement with them, buying and appreciating it.  Still, the public overall does not take the extreme position of the writers. <br />This CD is full of lush instrumentation, well arranged.  The guitar is acoustic, and there is heavy employment of strings and flutes.  Saxophones, vibraphones, and keyboards are also used.  The music is not really rock, but a blend of jazz and folk, with some classical and blues mixed in.  From what I've described, you probably think that the songs are pretty, which they are.  Except for \\"The Way Young Lovers Do,\\" which is a straight jazz waltz with a romantic chorus, the songs have a similar texture, in many ways sounding the same.  On Astral Weeks, Van is romping and frolicking or simply feeling good, in appealing natural or other physical settings, often with his loves.  He sings passionately, with frequent swooping upward cadences seemingly in the neighborhood of an octave.  The effect of his singing is evocative, although not melodramatic.  <br />Astral Weeks is indeed an atmospheric album as well as a musically very strong one.  The songs are not catchy, which helps explain its initial lack of commercial success.  The best track is the precious \\"Sweet Thing,\\" starting off with very pretty, fast acoustic guitar and then developing into a lush, intense, romantic adventure.  It is distinctive in that it drives ahead, steadily and upward, as opposed to the meandering in other Astral Weeks songs, and the effect is overwhelming.  The title cut is also superb, lovely and with some of the forcefulness of \\"Sweet Thing,\\" but it does drag a bit at the end.  The other six songs are not as strong, the odd man out, \\"The Way Young Lovers Do,\\" being the best of these.  \\"Cyprus Avenue\\" iscertainly also pretty, with sweet-sounding tho insubstantial harpsichord overlays, but the strings are too syrupy, and this is also a problem on \\"Madame George.\\"  \\"Ballerina\\" is another good song, with excellent vibraphones, but Van and the musicians engage in tremendous efforts to make it a great one and do not manage to do so. <br />Van sings well, forcefully and with feeling, and handles the demands of range as well as he can.  However, the sound of his voice is not pleasant.  It is harsh rather than smooth, somewhat strident and raspy and even hinting at nasal, whether it actually is or not.  I cannot neglect to consider this when evaluating Astral Weeks, cited by the idolaters for beauty rather than potent rock and roll.  In a similar way, Bob Dylan's voice is a negative always for me and many others.  On Astral Weeks, Van's vocals also get excessive at times, as on \\"Beside You,\\" when he seems to be trying to be almost operatic in his vocal suspensions, cadences, and intensity.<br />Astral Weeks has been said to be an album of \\"compelling beauty.\\"  I stick to \\"Sweet Thing\\" (compelling beauty is an understatement for this song) and most of the title cut, along with other sporadic moments.  For comparative purposes, things must be kept in perspective, even by those who think more highly of Astral Weeks than I do.  A great number of Beatles songs; some pop hits of The Supremes and other Motown groups; Stevie Wonder's love songs; some work by The Who, Eric Clapton, The Byrds, Joni Mitchell, and even The Rolling Stones; and on the dark side, much of the work of The Doors, Santana, and The Velvet Underground, clearly deserve the characterization above more than most songs on this album.  Rocking, hard-driving songs also merit consideration when \\"greatness\\" is the subject.  I emphasize that musical complexity is ultimately not what is telling, but rather emotional content.  \\"Be My Baby\\" is one of my favorites, and I do not care if other tunes are more sophisticated musically.  Astral Weeks is noteworthy because its rich musical totality is unique.  I definitely recommend it.  Is it one of the greatest of all time?  For me, the answer is no.
0812550706|3.0|&quot;Ender's Game&quot; is a rather amateurishly written book that partially redeems itself in the last twenty or so pages. Some intriguing (but half-baked) ideas and a couple of interesting pontifications on the nature of information/power/education are undermined by silly &amp; unbelievable dialog, sketchy characterizations, and some truly head-shakingly awful writing. The only thing that saves this book from well-deserved placement on my Ten Most Overrated Books list is the plot twist that leads to a satisfying conclusion. Still, I can think of a considerable number of books that are more deserving of hype that surrounds this overrated tome. <br />I'd like to give it 2.5 stars, but I guess I'll round it up to 3; I think this book would go over better with someone under the age of 16.
B000000OQF|4.0|I bought this for someone who is into Guns 'n' Roses as well as Queen, Led Zepellin, and a lot of other hard rock and heavy metal groups. He had their second album, which he also plays regularly, but he said if I could get him any cd as a gift he wanted \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" because it had all of the band's best hits. I do not listen to this genre of music often but I did enjoy it. \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", \\"Nightrain\\", \\"Paradise City\\", and \\"Sweet Child O'Mine\\" were the ones that stood out to me and I think they were all singles but the rest of the album is on the same line as the previously mentioned songs. I recommend it for anyone who likes rock, hard rock, and heavy metal or wants to buy a gift for someone who does. Even if you normally dislike the genre, you can't help but nod your head to a few of the tracks.
B000066JES|4.0|The Kings of Metal have returned in Warriors of the World, but they're not the same band you are used to. Thankfully, Manowar has not \\"sold out,\\" but they are different.<br />This album seems to be a more somber, serious collection of Manowar songs. It's still filled with the power and passion we've come to demand from them, but the song seem to have a more mature feel to them, and not the typical \\"devil may care\\" attitude they usually express.<br />Half the songs on this album are melodic ballads, which would cause most metal bigots to turn their noses. The \\"metal bigots\\" are folks who think anything other than mind-bounding, hard riffing, drum smashing heavy metal isn't music. They're as bad as Christians who think anything heavier than Jars of Clay is the work of Satan. I know, I have been at both ends of the spectrum.<br />\\"Call to Arms\\" is a typical, strong Manowar opening, but it's in a strange contrast to the lighter, and very touching  \\"The Fight for Freedom,\\" a tribute to the victims of 9/11. \\"Nessun Dorma\\" is not metal, but it is outstanding and beautiful, proving again Eric Adams is one of the greatest singers on Earth!<br />\\"The March\\" is also very un-metal, but a fitting tribute to Wagner, and deserving so. Before Manowar, before Celtic Frost, and before Black Sabbath, there was Wagner, and without him, their would be no metal.<br />But there's plenty of the power of metal, with smashing songs like \\"Warriors of the World United,\\" \\"Hands of Doom,\\" and \\"Fight Until We Die,\\" proving the Kings of Metal are still holding the throne.<br />...
B000002LND|5.0|It's the year 3002. Earthlings are reading about pop music's history and they come across the media craze revolving Madonna. If one album can define Madonna's pop impact it is \\"The Immaculate Collectiion\\". From her days as a disco wild child (\\"Holiday\\", \\"Lucky Star\\") to the era of her reign as the Queen of Pop (\\"Like A Prayer\\", \\"Vogue\\"), her most widely celebrated songs are present. The older songs have been enhanced for a better sound quality. There are two news songs (new in 1990), the sexy \\"Justify My Love\\" where she basically talks dirty through the whole track, and \\"Rescue Me\\". At first I didn't like \\"Rescue Me\\" but it eventually grew on me. The drawbacks: \\"Holdiday\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\" have been edited and in the middle of \\"Like A Prayer\\" there is a gospel/dance break. Who cares? The songs are not changed drastically and the album is still a must-have.
B00004Z459|4.0|Everyone who thinks of LP and says O GREAT ANOTHER LIMP BIZKIT is not thinkin about the band, but rather the genre. theyre thinkin about the played out rap/metal scene. I along with everybody else on this planet am sick of all the rap metal bands that can't cut it. LP is one that works and it sounds awesome. I'm not sayin this cd is 100% because it does have its bad tracks, but what album doesn't? The only problem i have with this cd is radio playin it out. If you were to actually listen to the cd without thinkin, AWW IM SO SICK OF RAPROCK then you would appreciate it for what it is, good music. Before you think that i am just another follower of MTV TRL bands, think again, Linking Park is a good band, whatever genre you wanna put em in. \\"cure for the itch\\" is one of the illest tracks ive heard in years! Alls i gotta say is WATCH OUT FOR REANIMATION, the remix cd is going to kick ass. PEACE!!!
0131103628|5.0|Ok, so I didn't actually buy the book (yet). But, I read about 30 pages at my local book store. It is incredible. I'm sort of a new programmer, but I know a bit of JavaScript and a bit of C++. JavaScript and C++ both have a similar structure to C, you know, functions, curly brackets, etc. I would recommend this to anyone who has even a little experience and just a basic understanding of the C structure. <br />My recommendations to *complete* beginners:<br />1. Read a few online tutorials/ebooks.<BR>2. Get this book.<br />For beginners with a bit of experience:<br />1. Get this book.<br />For programming experts in other languages:<br />1. Get this book.<br />Pretty simple huh? <br />This book is also very &quot;get to the point&quot;. What I mean is that within the first 30 pages, it goes from a &lt;=10 (smaller than or equal to) line &quot;hello, world&quot; program, to a &gt;= 20 (larger than or equal to) line advanced while-for looping program. I know it says something like &quot;why write a 600-page book when you can write a 200-page book and learn the same thing&quot;. Sorry if that quote is entirely wrong, I just don't have an idedic memory.<br />Buy it, you'll love it.
6302150930|5.0|It is a wonderful film. Nastassja Kinski is fantastic in it. It's certainly one of her best roles ever. <BR>The film is very long but it's worth watching.
B000067DNC|5.0|We have watched these in their individual releases, the show is equally engaging as Star Trek and the X-files once you capture the story ines and the very cohesive cast. I would have to say it is the best casting of a show I have ever seen.
B00000JPH5|5.0|Labyrinth is, without a doubt, the best movie I've ever seen.  What I love most about it, is that everything is different than what it initially appears.  The story and everything in it, can be interpreted on many different levels.<br />On the surface it is about a young girl named Sarah (Connelly), who sees herself as a heroine in distress, and one night when she is fed up with babysitting her baby brother Toby, wishes the goblins to take him away.  She then has make her way through a mystical labyrinth, and defeat the evil goblin king (Bowie) to get him back.<br />On a deeper level, there are many different plots of the story.  One of them being how Sarah is a dreamer who creates the labyrinth in her imagination.  Upon emerging from the labyrinth, she has learned a lesson, has grown up, and gives up her childlike dreams ready face the real world.  Then at the end, she learns that it is still important to keep a part of her dreams with her, and not completely lose herself to the real world. <br />On another level,it is about Jareth (the goblin king) falling in love with Sarah, and trying to free himself from the basic story of good v.s. evil.  At the beginning he is content to play the antagonist of the story, but at the end, he know longer wants to defeat Sarah, but wants her companionship.  Throughout the film, he tries to pursade her to follow her dreams, and to choose her path between the stars, promising that she'll find his love, and that she can have a fairytale ending.  He offers her, her dreams, and wants to destroy the basic denoument of good defeating evil.  Yet at the same time, as he shows her her dreams in the ballroom scene, he twists them, making them more sinister, malicious.  Sarah comes to realize that maybe her dreams aren't what they are made out to be.  Maybe living in a fantasy world isn't such a good idea.  And so, she chooses to live in the real world, and face her responsibilities.<br />Well that's about it...hope I didn't confuse you!
B00003CXI1|5.0|... and J.K. Rowling's exceptional sense of humor all make this a keeper.  I wonder why Chris Columbus &amp; Co. deleted the Deleted Scenes, though: they were all on a par with the rest, some of them added plot points, and the seven of them together probably totaled less than five minutes.
B000065U1N|5.0|I think it was of the best moves of the year. you guys need to make a nother movie like this again.
B000065U1N|3.0|A few years back, Michael Bay released my favorite action movie, 'The Rock'. Now, every now and again I enjoy to sit back and watch as bad guys get shot and things get blown up...it's all just mindless fun. But for the most part, I enjoy a good, solid film, and would probably choose a drama over an action. My favorite movie, action or not, is 'Saving Private Ryan', hands down. It provides action, yes, but historically and introduces you to eight men that you grow to know through the three hours you sit viewing the picture. With 'Black Hawk Down', I was hoping for more of the same. I was wrong.<br />Yes, if this film did not begin with the words 'Based on an Actual Event', I would say, \\"Hey, what a great movie!\\" and would be ranking this much higher on a stricly action scale. However, this really happened. Ridley Scott--whose work I do not enjoy for the most part--took a great story and made it into an action movie. Personally, I would not have minded if he would've taken three or four characters and used the first forty-five minutes to tell us their stories...and then follow them through this horrid battle that takes place later. Instead, he focuses on the entire scene, which, to me, was just overwhelming.<br />In camoflague and helmets and goggles, I could not tell one man from the other. I could pick out Josh Hartnett--just barely--and Tom Sizemore, but other than that, I kept telling myself, \\"Care because they're Americans.\\" To some degree this works, but not as it should. By the end of the film, I had forgotten that this really occurred, and had to say, \\"Wow, that had to be terrible,\\" but by forcing myself to comprehend it all. <br />'Saving Private Ryan' this film is not. In fact, 'The Rock' would have been given a run for its money by Scott's 'Black Hawk Down'. But the fact that this is not just a mindless action movie but is instead shown as one takes away from the movie as a whole. Watch it...it's worth a viewing, but it was not what I wanted, and unfortunately, it was exactly what I expected.
B000056K04|5.0|I can't believe the negative comments I have read about this CD, I like most everything the band has done, but I have gotten to like this cd the best. Bands have to evolve to stay fresh.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Upon first listen, I thought it was good, however as I started to learn the words to each song I began to appreciate just how creative each song is and just how good of a song writer John is. The songs take on the story telling style in a unique way. Alot is said without actually saying, for example one lyric is \\" I never liked this apple much, it always seemed to big to touch\\"(City Love) of course referencing NY. Amist dozens of artists who all share the same song writer, his creativity is greatly appreciated. Every song gets better and better and better as you listen. Some stand out songs are \\"No Such Thing\\", \\"Why Georgia\\", \\"My Stupid Mouth\\",\\"Your body is a Wonderland\\" \\"Neon\\",\\"City Love\\",\\"83\\",\\"3x5\\",\\"Love Song for No One\\" \\"Back to You\\", \\"Great Indoors\\",\\"Not Myself\\", \\"St.Patrick's Day\\".Well, that's all of them.I don't skip any songs on this cd because there is no reason to. The music is very upbeat and soulful.He's got some great guitar that I just had to learn to play.His sound has been done but it's done so well you never think \\"I've heard this song before\\" which is pretty common nowadays.  Absolutely brilliant.Buy it and don't let it leave your cd player.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I really liked to hear L. Cohen again. Great record and great lyrics.
B000002L82|5.0|New Order is a band that is too good to be true. They've made so many great singles and albums in the twentysomething years they've existed, it's difficult to comprehend. The fact that this album, arguably their best, was only their second full-length album is hard to believe.<br />The album kicks off with one of its best tracks, &quot;Age of Consent&quot;. This and the album's finisher, &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;, are much more alternative rock than the other tracks. The great drumming is what stands out to me with this one. Meanwhile, &quot;The Village&quot; is probably the best song on Side One, with its great guitar playing and Sumner sounding better than ever. &quot;5 8 6&quot; is basically &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, only a little different. Not to say that's a bad thing though. &quot;Your Silent Face&quot;, originally called KW1 after Kraftwerk, is the most melodic song on the entire album, and features some fantastic synth strings. It's rather ironic to put &quot;Ultraviolence&quot; right after &quot;Your Silent Face&quot;, as it's the darkest track on the album. And finally, the aforementioned &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; is the perfect closer, very mellow and subdued.<br />I have no idea why &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and &quot;The Beach&quot; are on here, as they completely mess up the flow of the album. Do yourself a favor, and either listen to PCL on a CD Player that has a Program option, or burn a copy from downloaded MP3s without &quot;Monday&quot; and &quot;Beach&quot;. This is the way the album is meant to be heard.<br />I don't think New Order will ever top this album, although I'd love to be proven wrong. If you like PCL, check out Low-Life, Substance, Get Ready, and, well, what the hell, just check out all of Joy Division's stuff while you're at it.
B00005221M|2.0|I loved the movie when I saw it in the theatre, but I was so disappointed that several scenes had been cut from this new edition.  The original film is 122 minutes.  The &quot;expanded version&quot; is 117 minutes - that's five missing minutes! <br />What happened to the lovely song by Clannad, &quot;I will find you?&quot;  Where is the line, &quot;Someday you and I are going to have a serious disagreement?&quot; How about when Hawkeye asks Duncan if he has nothing better to do on the lake that day?  Where did that go? Also, I thought there was a big scene where Hawkeye and Cora talked about the fact that if only one of them survived, the spirit of the other one would also live. <br />These were all powerful scenes that would've made the DVD better.  The editing was very poor.  In one scene, right after Cora and Hawkeye first kiss, etc, the screen actually freezes before going to the next scene where Hawkeye is taken into custody.  It's not even &quot;movie of the week&quot; quality at that point.<br />I'm at a loss as to where to get the complete movie in a modern version.  I don't usually do VHS, but if it means I get the movie in full, I can make an exception.  Was Mr. Mann having a bad day when he made these editing decisions?  That's all I can figure.
B000001FMQ|3.0|'Crazy nights' isn't one of KISS's finest moments in the band's long history.<BR>The record is very slick, and generally well polished in most places, but it suffers from KISS not being themselves. One can tell that the band was uncertain of who they were at this point in time.<BR>One of the problems here is that the record doesn't stand the test of time. It sounds VERY 80's. In my opinion, it doesn't sound as cliche as Poison or Bon Jovi, but it's definitely in the same league.<BR>I don't find the album as a whole all that bad, just confused. There are some good songs here, like &quot;Hell of high water&quot;, &quot;Reason to live&quot; and &quot;Thief in the night&quot; are all really cool songs. But, with the good, come the bad. &quot;Crazy, crazy nights&quot;, &quot;Turn on the night&quot;, and &quot;No, no, no&quot; are all weak 80's pop-metal songs that I find are rather embarrasing to listen to when company's present.<BR>One of the saving graces on this album are the performances by guitarist Bruce Kulick and drummer Eric Carr. The lead guitar and drums on this album, along with the few good/decent songs here are what help this album stand above any of your average 80's garbage that was around at the time.
B000063T0T|4.0|Mixing music hall and opera with occasional doses of rap, tango, jazz, chanson française, electronica and bollywood style music, Moulin Rouge's soundtrack is what you might definitely call hyper-eclectic. As you can see from the track list, anything from Your Song to Nature Boy and Roxanne was thrown in, reworked, rearranged and revamped and it doesn't only hold together, it works amazingly well. The highlights include David Bowie's version of Nature Boy, the hyperactive Sparkling Diamonds (a medley of Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend and Material Girl) sung by Nicole Kidman, and an operatic version of Elton John's Your Song wonderfully performed by the multitalented Ewan McGregor. Other attempts are less successful, Cristina Aguilera-Pink-Lil Kim-etc.'s Lady Marmalade is a bit lacklustre and Fatboy Slim's Because We Can is annoyingly repetitive.<br />The first CD features a lot of covers and remixes that weren't used in the film, but the second CD is made up almost entirely of music that was actually in the movie. Here you'll find the film version of Sparkling Diamonds, a wonderfully operatic version of The Show Must Go On sung by the excellent Jim Broadbent, some very beautiful instrumental music and a remix of One Day I'll Fly Away by Nicole Kidman that's as good as the version used in the film. One minor complaint: Kylie Minogue's extremely funny rendition of The Sound of Music is sorely missed!
B0000636UN|1.0|Sheryl Crow is a lightweight talent best when she's pushing herself.  Her best songs limn the Hollywood ennui that's her lot in life as a product of the L.A. celebrity crash'n'burn.  She came up through the ranks, triumphed, and has no intention of sliding back down.  On C'mon, C'mon she trades the depth of The Globe Sessions for a sunny surface that's catchy yet ultimately empty.  Let's give her credit though - going through a rough patch in her life, she refused to wallow in her misery, hoping to transform it by immersing in the uptempo.  Rock and rollers have kept the blues away for years by confronting them with fierce music that, by its very nature, refuses to settle for depression.  But forcing happiness usually leaves you with whimsy, leaden whimsy.  And these 13 tracks fall straight from the top of the Hollywood sign with a thud.
B00005QDW1|2.0|I have been a No Doubt fan for quite a while, and I have to say that as much as I was looking forward to this album, I am even more dissapointed. They have really taken a step down in the quality and thought put into thier music. Before they had a fun, twisted punk sound, and now most of thier songs sound like the same mass-produced guitar riffs all over the radio, used in all the &quot;pop star bubblegum&quot; sound thats out there now. Gwen sounds more like Christina Agulera or Brittany Spears than ever. I am left hoping they look more back to where they started in order to achieve a better sound, because this one just doesn't get it.
B00006690F|3.0|His rapping gifts are still in tact, but on The Eminem Show our Modern Martyr sounds tired.  In  of the songs on The Eminem Show, Mr. Mathers lashes back at and/or defends himself from all the miserable bastards out to get him.  That might be nothing new, but the lack of narrative focus and comic invention is.  He's never sounded self-pitying before - now that's his primary tone.  Even so, the man is probably incapable of putting out a bad record.  On The Eminem Show there are three great tracks:  \\"White America\\", where he takes on the racial divide of rap, \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\", where he takes on (again) his mom, and \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\", where his precious Hailie Jade gets one over on Dad at Dad's expense.  Elsewhere, it's show biz as usual.
B000065U1N|2.0|This film is the longest recruitment ad for the Marines I have ever seen. In this modern world of media and warfare, interventions like this are more complex, but they have been oversimplified to side with U.S. objectives. There have been thousands of innocent people killed in other countries (South Africa, Bosnia, China), why do you think America singled out Somalia for assistance?... <br />If you really want to see a good movie about the complexities of modern warfare where tragedies ensue when people try to give assistance, see \\"No Man's Land\\" directed by Danis Tanovic. This film shows how affecting military intervention can be from several different perspectives. It does so without the usual big-budget Hollywood treatment, so those of you raised on Go U.S.A. Rambo-style action sequences maybe bored.
0848801571|5.0|I can't speak as to his other works, but this work really is a bit of genius.  It's an exciting read (I finished it in 2 sittings), with almost no fluff or triviality (excepting the physical appearance of the Overlords, which I found rather silly--and hardly universal). Though clothed as a sci-fi novel, it is philosophical in the extreme and is deeply influenced by Nietzsche.  Consider: the &quot;Overlords&quot; (=ubermenschen), the &quot;Last Man&quot; and his pettiness in not being made for the stars, the implicit contrast between the Apollonian (the Overlords &amp; their seemingly all-powerful intellect  undercut with despair in its own ultimate failure and subservience to an incomprehensible Higher Power) and the Dionysian (humankind's evolutionary offspring, with their utter disregard for their own precursors in their collective absorption in transcendental, universe-bending ritual), and the author's deep interest in the occult (see Clarke's rambling new preface, in the [slightly] revised edition).  A definite must-read, with layers of meaning and a disturbingly tragic ending.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is SO funny! I love it! My family and I are such fans of this movie that we know all the words to the Camalot song, a.k.a. Knights of the Round Table! We have entire scenes memorized! <br />This movie is about King Arthur's quest to find the Holy Grail. He is joined by Sir Lancelot, Sir Robin, Sir Galahad and the rest as they search throughout England for a holy cup. Their quest begins when King Arthur has finally rounded up his knights of the Round Table and they are given an assignment from the Lord. Arthur and his knights encounter a taunting French guard, knights that say \\"Ne\\" and lots more! Filled with funny songs and catchy lines, this is one movie you won't want to miss!!!!
B00005QFHG|4.0|While other reviewers focus on the way that Juliette Binoche's character brings savor and tolerance to a repressed French village, the moving thing in the story for me is how she learns that she doesn't have to keep running from place to place, and can in fact be happy and free even though she settles down.  An important lesson for \\"free spirits\\".<br />I watched this with my girls aged 8 and 5, and while there were a few semi-explicit sex scenes that some parents would prefer their kids not to see, mine were impressed with the characters and the story.  They enjoyed it greatly along with me, which I don't mean to imply makes it a kids' movie in any way.  But there is a story here that appeals to all ages.
0064407667|5.0|When I first picked up this book, I was a little unsure about how much I would enjoy it. However, I was hooked by the time I finished the first chapter! Now I have read every book in the series! If you are looking for a funny and great read this is one book you need to pick up!<br />The Bad Beginning is the first in a series about the unfortunate events that happen to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, the heirs to a huge fortune. Their misfortunes begin when their parents are killed in a fire and they are sent to live with a cousin. To find out more, you'll just have to read the book! Enjoy!
B000062XFG|5.0|After watching the first season and reading the reviews I expected more of the tentative and corny plots of season 1...<br />Well, some of the episodes may still be a bit corny by later seasons' standards, but the variety of the plots and the freshness of the characters more than made up for it.  I mean, who knew that Worff had a sense of humor, and could even smile?
B0000640VN|3.0|THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THE FILM ON THIS DVD. THEATRICAL AND DIRECTOR'S CUT. THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE DIRECTOR'S CUT. KATE AND LEOPOLD IS ENJOYABLE ENOUGH THAT... YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END. HOWEVER, NOT MUCH HAPPENS. LIEV SCHREIBER IS A SCENE STEALER, AND THE OTHER CAST MEMBERS ARE GREAT AS WELL. THE FILM BELONGS TO HUGH JACKMAN (LEOPOLD) WHO IS BECOMING A MAJOR MOVIESTAR WITH EACH PICTURE HE DOES. ON THE FLIP SIDE THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ABSENCE OF LEOPOLD'S COUNTERPART (KATE) PLAYED BY MEG RYAN. SHE IS WONDERFUL WHILE SHE'S ON SCREEN. BUT SHE'S NOT ON SCREEN AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD THINK. LITE ON BOTH COMEDY AND ROMANCE THE FILM WILL DO ON A SLOW NIGHT AT THE VIDEO STORE, IF YOU'VE ALREADY RENTED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE. IT'S KINDA LIKE \\"WHEN HARRY MET SALLY\\" MEETS \\"BACK TO THE FUTURE\\", BUT NOT AS REWARDING AS EITHER. ALL AND ALL WORTH SEEING FOR A TERRIFIC CAST.
B0000024RQ|5.0|This album is very good! 'Blowin in the Wind' is a classic Bob Dylan song and rightly, too. The lyrics, beat, and rythm are all top-notch. My favorite song on this album 'Masters of war' is an anger-filled song that I think is terrific. Bob Dylan has and always will be one of the best (if not the best) folk-rock performer. This, one of his first albums, is a classic.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I'm a fan of the games. Jolie brings the character to life perfectly, right down to the way Lara fires her guns.  She's strong, independent, smart, and also fraily human.  The story is good, with some nice twists and spiritual touches.  It's not all action--it's Lara's quest to reach her lost father.  The writers kept in mind the attraction of the two Raiders, the mystery of ancient rituals and the ancients'  obsession with icons.  The movie is set in terrific scenery with fantastic creatures for Lara to fight.  I don't think it could have been done any better, and can't wait for the next one.
6304819935|4.0|Evil Dead 2,D.B.D is a unique,albeit bizzare film I have trouble pigeonholing as a specificly themed movie.It kinda picks up where Evil Dead left off,kinda sorta,but the first was all horror,something akin to Blair Witch Project.This sequel will not only give you a shiver, but will make you laugh your socks off!Bruce Campbell once again returns as Nash,and the old house from hell are still there, but you quickly notice this one's different.The parts about the posessed room and the posessed hand are hilarious! If you want a serious movie with an engrossing,twisted plot,not here folks,but it sure is fun!
B00004U2G4|4.0|This album is a great Jeff Beck record. However, I do not believe it is his best. Why? Well, Jeff Beck is the greatest guitarist that ever lived. As time went on, he got better, and he is the best at singing with his guitar. Therefore, his instrumental stuff allows him to be a better guitar player. I suggest checking out You Had It Coming and Guitar Shop if you want some real rocking Jeff Beck. He rocks on You Had It Coming like you won't believe...but that's another review.<br />Back to Truth. Of course, anything with Jeff Beck's name on it is a masterpiece. Truth is no exception. His solos are amazing and his rhythm playing is also very good. However, I may be an outcast on this, but I prefer Bob Tench's (Jeff Beck Group II) singing to Rod Stewart's. Don't get me wrong, he's not a bad singer, as a matter of fact this is his best work. However, it's a bit overpowering at times. And believe me, I would rather be overpowered by Jeff's guitar than Rod's voice. But that is definately not enough to not like this album. <br />Songs such as Shapes of Things and You Shook Me are amongst the album's highlights. Jeff took the Yardbird's classic Shapes of Things, and slowed it down a little, made it a bit dirty. And I'll have you know it works very well. The originals on this album are also pretty strong. The musicianship is pretty good, however it is apparent that Jeff is the best one in the group. If the group got back together today, Jeff would be lightyears ahead of them, because he got even better over time, and he's at his best today.<br />Overall, Truth is a good buy and a good listen. It's a nice album to sit on your porch and drink lemonade to, and that ain't a bad thing. A good album.

B00005AREQ|5.0|Blow by Blow is, no doubt, one of Jeff Beck's best albums. I also recommend getting You Had It Coming (2001), Wired (1976), and Guitar Shop (1989) for more of Jeff's best. <br />I do not believe there is one bad track on this album. Cause We've Ended as Lovers is obviously the stand out track, but we'll get back to that later. Jeff's cover of She's a Woman is superb, his work with the talkbox is matched by no other guitarist. Too bad Frampton had to go and kill it.<br />A.I.R. Blower and Scatterbrain are also very strong tunes. They contain great melodies, and great solos. Each has a long break in the middle for Jeff to really sing with his guitar. Thelonius is a fun tune, and Freeway Jam is one of my favorite rock tunes, this is classic rock indeed. Diamond Dust contains more of Jeff's emotional playing.<br />As promised, I will now get back to Cause We've Ended as Lovers. This track is beautiful, emotional, and tasteful. It can be compared to Nadia (of You Had It Coming). It contains a great solo from Jeff, and allows Jeff to really open up and show us what he can do. The best of the album, and one of the best of Jeff's career. Really beautiful. Jeff uses a hot rodded Telecaster, appropriately named the Tele-Gib. A nice tone.
B000002KCI|4.0|This is one of the best albums Neil Young has done with his stalwart backing band, Crazy Horse. Although it contains two fine and particularly beautiful acoustic tracks, Pardon My Heart and Through My Sails (the latter a CSNY outtake), the standout tracks are the guitar-heavy extended jams. It's not a full-out assault like Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and the later Ragged Glory: most of the songs are fairly mid-tempo - though loud and rocking - such as the classic opener Don't Cry No Tears, Barstool Blues, and Stupid Girl. A couple of the tracks are more laid-back, and feature the most folky, country-ish side of Neil - songs such as Lookin' For A Love. These provide a nice change of pace. The undoubted standout songs on the album, however, are the extended jams on Danger Bird, and, especially, Cortez The Killer, which contains some of Neil's finest guitar soloing ever. This is the most he had cut loose on record since Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. Lyrically, he had moved away from the bleak outlook he had taken to task on his previous albums, and the main thematic element here is lost love - but it's not mourning about it, even: indeed, the general sentiment here seems to be a readyness to move on to the next relationship. Granted, as with most of Young's records that feature Crazy Horse, the lyrics here are not among his best: the music is the main focus; and, thankfully, this album contains some of his very best jams. The absolutely astounding intro and long solo to Cortez The Killer - one of those moments that you simply must hear to believe. It just has to be experienced. Although none of the other tracks on this album can match that masterpiece, there is a general high level of craft here, making for another essential Neil Young album.
B00000I924|5.0|... Who Else is a great disc. However, if you want even better guitar playing and better tone, check out Jeff's new release, You Had It Coming (one of his best albums).<br />Now, on with the disc. What Mamma Said is a fun, rockin' tune with a nice solo in the middle. Psycho Sam, one of my favorites on the disc, features great playing by both Jeff and Jennifer, and the main melody, or chorus, is just too cool. Brush with the Blues is the standout on the album, and contains some great, emotional playing by Jeff. This is comparable to Nadia (from You Had It Coming). The solo in Brush is amongst the best I've heard him do. Fantastic!<br />Blast from the East is a fun song with some complex rhythms (alternating time signatures). Space for the Papa is very good, a nice solo in the middle that switches from slide to fingers. Angel Footsteps is another highlight on the album. Jeff Beck is one of the best, and most tasteful, slide players. THX 138 is a complex and fast song, but Jeff plays nicely on it. Even Odds, a Jan Hammer piece, is another favorite of mine. Declan is a beatiful Irish cover, and is one of my favorites. Another Place is a peaceful closing to the disc.
B000066NW0|5.0|This album is really really good. Since the first time I heard Complicated I knew I will love Avril. The CD is well done, and almost everyone is great. <BR>-Losing Grip: A-, pretty solid it needs a bit more work<BR>-Complicated: A, rocks, I don't give A+ so this one is as good as it gets to me<BR>-SkaterBoi: B+, needs better lyrics, my only problem<BR>-I'm With You: A-, shows depth of her voice<BR>-Mobile: A-, Pretty cool<BR>-Unwanted:A-, sounds so LinkinParkish, way cool<BR>-Tomorrow: B+, I never like slow songs much<BR>-Anything But Oridnary: A, best song on the album<BR>-Things I'll Never Say: A, third best<BR>-My World: A, I can;y relate to this, but cool<BR>-Nobody's Fool: A-, so very true<BR>-Too Much To Ask:, A-, hold my fav. line: &quot;You can't see the world thru a mirror<BR>-Naked: B+, get the feeling, but seem like &quot;it's been done before&quot;<br />The thing I don't really get is why is Avril, being compared to Vanessa and Michelle? Dun get me wrong Michelle is my fav. artist ever, and Vanessa is so cool, but they are all very different. Yes they all have uncanny amounts of talent but why are they always put together? Michelle has got great voice and melodies, and she is so passionate. Vanessa focused on instrumental approach and a major songwriter. Avril is way personality and style. So overall great cd and great artist
B00001OH7G|4.0|This is a great live album. Rory Gallagher really mastered his Strat, and his singing wasn't bad either.<br />Perhaps the strongest cut on this album is Tatto'd Lady. It's hard rock/blues, but it's very tasteful as well. The keyboard solo is very nice, and Rory has some excellent ideas during his big solo at the end. Very nice.<br />This album is definately worth the purchase price. Rory's playing is very tasteful and melodic. He knows when to play fast, and when to take it slow. A Million Miles away is also a very strong cut with some nice soloing from Rory. It's a shame he passed away, because I believe as time went on, Rory would get even better. He was a true original, and this album shows it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet you really need to!! I have always enjoyed Ewan McGregor as an actor but this is his best work yet. Maybe you don't like Ewan maybe you like Nicole..she is great in this movie also. The music is amazing, the dancing is amazing, the acting is amazing, over all it just blew me away!! <br />Did I mention the bunches of hidden DVD features? Yep it has like 20!
B00005YXZH|5.0|I read through a lot of these reviews and I am disappointed by the narrow focus that is given to such an amazing album. There is no way you can compare this album to A.M. or Summerteeth - it is like comparing apples and oranges. All bands must evolve and progress, to rehash the same formula over and over is uninspiring. It's like saying back in 1965, if you were a fan of the Beatles, that you wish they didn't make Rubber Soul because you liked Help. Or in 1966 that The Beach Boys stuck with the same formula as the Party album and never made Pet Sounds. Or more recently in 1997 that Radiohead didn't come out with OK Computer and continued to make music like The Bends. A band only gets better when they try to do something different from each previous album.<br />The music on this album is gorgeous. If you like The Flaming Lips, Neutral Milk Hotel, The Doves, or Radiohead, you'll love this album. Admittedly, there is some weak songwriting on a couple of songs, but every album has flaws and you have to forgive Jeff Tweedy for that. Listen to it for what it is and not what you wanted it to be and you'll hear the genius.<br />All in all this album is a shining star in a sky filled with smog.
630438551X|4.0|I saw this movie for the first time when I was 10 years old, but then I saw about five years later when it was on TV and I laughed, cried and fell in love with it. Though I hate to tell ppl that this my favorite movie, it really is. It just feeds the hopeless romantic in me. Baz Luhrmann is a great director, even if you don't like his movies you gotta admire his brilliant creativity. Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are great as the young star-crossed lovers, but I could imagine different actors doing a finer job... (sorry guys!) My absolute favorite part of the movie is the party scene where R+J first meet. The Fishtank scene...*melt*....ahh gets me every time. But seriously, this movie is brilliant, a refreshing twist on the age old tale and I highly recommend renting it.

B000002WPI|5.0|This is without a doubt the best album found in hip-hop today. This is also the LP that inspired me to be a rapper. Some of the hardest and best metaphors can be found on this one CD. (I developed my style from this LP.) What I like about this CD is that every member of Wu has his well-deserved shine. All of these songs can be considered calssics. Wu-Tang has always been my favorite group. A group that has Method Man, GZA, RZA, Inspectah Deck & Ghostface Killah must be the greatest of all-time. A group that has these 5 lyricists AND produces hit after hit; hot album after hot album is definitly somewhat sacred. The top songs on this cut are C.R.E.A.M., Method Man, Can It All Be So Simple, Protect Ya Neck & Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthin Ta [Mess] Wit. If you don't have this LP, then your life just isnt complete. Below is my track rating (1-5):<br />Track 1 - 5 <BR>Track 2 - 4.5<BR>Track 3 - 5<BR>Track 4 - 4.5<BR>Track 5 - 5<BR>Track 6 - 5<BR>Track 7 - 5<BR>Track 8 - 5+++<BR>Track 9 - 5+++<BR>Track 10 - 5+++<br />Track 11 - 5<BR>Track 12 - 4.5

B00006690F|5.0|When Slim Shady got beat at the Grammy's by Steely Dan two years ago for the Album of the Year, practically everyone under the age of 30 who was watching the telecast knew that the fix had to be in.  \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" shook the music world to its foundations, making closet fans out of America's suburban youth, sending high-powered politicians into a tizzy, and receiving widespread acclaim in both the mainstream and the underground press.  If \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" wasn't Album of the Year, it was hard to imagine what it would take for Eminem to overcome the social stigma and finally gain the recognition he deserved.<br />\\"The Eminem Show\\" is here.  And this is what it takes.<br />After all the hype, after all the controversy, after all the news stories, the hatred, and the doubters, sliding that new full-length Eminem CD into your deck feels like an event.  But truthfully, no adjective could describe how amazing this album truly is.  When you compare this album with the empty, uninspired trash that has made it into heavy rotation since Slim's last release, you quickly realize that despite the offensive nature of some of his sentiments, Marshall Mathers is a genius;  as he dubs himself on \\"Renegades,\\" a \\"modern-day Shakespeare.\\"<br />Eminem is the most gifted poet of our time.  Putting to one side the content of his message, the form of the lyrical structure he creates is unparalleled in the history of hip-hop.  No artist has ever been able to master the intricate rhyme patterns that Eminem seemingly effortlessly spits on song after song after song.  Unlike \\"The Marshall Mathers LP,\\" in which Slim's lyrical delivery was a bit lacking on a handful of tracks, every single track on \\"The Eminem Show\\" features absolute lyrical wizardry from Mathers.  You simply won't believe the verbal gymnastics on the last verse of \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood,\\" the first verse of \\"Til I Collapse,\\" the last verse of \\"Square Dance,\\" just to name a few.  I have been listening to rapand hip-hop for over 15 years, and I personally have never heard anything like this.  As hard as it is to believe, Eminem's style seems to have gotten better since his last release.  Much better.  SCARY better.  I simply don't think there is currently another commercial rapper alive who can compete with this.  Eminem is so much better than his contemporaries at his delivery that he makes heavy hitters like Jay-Z and Nas look like amateurs.  I mean no disrespect to Jay-Z and Nas whatsoever.  I have every one of their albums, I love them both to death, but Eminem is just leaps and bounds better than them.  It's almost funny how good he is.  <br />Turning to the content of the album, I was surprised and delighted to find that Eminem has almost completely abandoned his tactic of dissing Britney, Christina Aguilera, and N-Sync.  Aside from the Moby reference on the single, \\"Without Me,\\" a few Canibus slams on \\"Square Dance,\\" and a Jermaine Dupri double-team with Dr. Dre on \\"Say What You Say,\\" Eminem has shied away from using his lethal lyrics to assault and batter his peers in the music industry.  This is refreshing, because Eminem's talent is so profound that for him to even acknowledge the existence of the Britneys and N-Syncs only reduces his credibility.  What remains of Em's anger on the new album is primarily directed towards the father who abandoned him, the girlfriend who betrayed him, the media that alienates him, the politicians that censor him, the millions of parents that blame him, and, of course, his mother, who Eminem pinpoints as the source of his neverending animosity and rage.  While the lyrics on \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" aimed to shock and insult, many of the words on this album are devoted to social commentary and, believe it or not, political statement.  I found myself frequently nodding in agreement along with \\"White America,\\" which provides a four-minute glimpse into the truth behind Eminem's rapid rise to stardom, \\"Square Dance,\\" which contains some thinly-veiled antiwar messages, and \\"Sing For The Moment,\\" which samples Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" and will bring a tear to your eye if you aren't careful.  <br />Following along with the title of the album, Eminem also talks alot about himself.  In \\"Cleaning Out My Closet,\\" he savages his mother worse than ever before, and gives listeners some insight into his childhood.  In \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood,\\" my early pick for the album's best song, he opines about the downside of fame. (Incidentally, this song serves as a nice bookend to \\"The Slim Shady LP\\"s \\"If I Had,\\" which features Em pining for more fame.  Be careful what you wish for...)  And finally, on \\"Hailie's Song,\\" Em offers a touching tribute to his daughter.  Although he makes a failed attempt at singing on this track--one of his few missteps on the album--when the \\"real\\" Slim Shady triumphantly returns on the song's last verse with another stellar rap verse, you're inclined to almost immediately forgive him.  And it's nowhere near as bad as Biggie on \\"Playa Hata.\\"<br />The year isn't over yet, but \\"The Eminem Show\\" is a safe bet for the year's best.  Eminem is today's version of The Beatles;  not in terms of the style or content of his music, but in terms of his effect on the culture and the minds of America's youth.  Eminem proudly represents the conflict inside each and every one of us.  The struggle between doing right and doing wrong; between maturity and immaturity;  between genius and insanity.  <br />But he probably still won't win the Grammy.<br />Dan
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is one of the all time great movies.  It has it all,  great acting, engrossing storyline, excitement, romance, laughter and above all,  fantastic battle scenes.  Despite the militaristic nature of the topic this movie goes down well with both men and woman.  This is not solely because it stars the good looking Mel Gibson (so my wife tells me), but it's because he excels in his role and is aptly supported by others in the cast.  I know of a number of people who have watched this movie well over 50 times and can recite the lines verbatim. Okay, we are not all that devoted to the movie, but it goes some way to conveying how much this movie has captured most peoples imagination. Can't really add too much more about this movie that hasn't been said already by previous reviewers, suffice to say this movie has done exceedingly well, what it set out to do.  Essential viewing really.

B000003TA4|5.0|In short... Kurts words, life, and massages that he sent us will not soon be forgotten. If you`re down and out, these will give you the will to move on, to get up and \\"find god\\". I personally agree with the millions of people who have noted that this is the greatest and most thought through acheivement of our time. This and his other albums are so deep and mindful of everyone elses thoughts and emotions, that it and the others should at least be included in their collections. I remember the day of the 18th of april in 1994. Junior high. I couldn`t keep the tears back. I and others greived as we heard the news and the rumors of this grunge gods death. Suicide? Homocide? Many people have their own myths, rumors and beleifs. I for one, didn`t care. All i knew was that it was the death of a man i had grown to love. One thats words and messages moved me to be better than i was... I was saddened to hear that he had \\"given up\\" and couldn`t go on with the show. But in his absence, i and all of his fans will live his dream through and relish in his greatness. Kurt this is for you. For all that you were, are, and always will be. Always in our hearts.  Peace, Love, Empathy.<BR>You and your words will inspire us forever...
B00005JKED|2.0|I was very disappointed in this film.  Denzel Washington's character was over-the-top, and Denzel himself in this role was simply not believable as Alonzo Harris - a narcotics detective gone bad.  Perhaps I'm used to seeing Denzel in roles that are a little less vile.  Aside from being overly violent, bloody, and sometimes downright gory, the story itself leaves a little to be desired in that the \\"rookie\\" (Ethan Hawke) is taken out for a day to learn the ropes of the Narcotics Unit, and is taught by Alonzo (Denzel) within the first few hours of training that the usual rules don't apply on the streets.  He uses his badge and the support of his superior officers to steal, murder, deceive, etc., while explaining to Jake (Hawke) that in order to defeat the enemy he must become the enemy, in an attempt to justify his actions I guess.  If I have to say something nice about this film it would be that Ethan Hawke delivered a knockout performance as the white boy rookie fighting against the temptation of corruption and the promise of making detective in 18 months in order to be a good cop.  All in all, I can't understand why this film was nominated, much less won, any Oscars.

B000066F6H|3.0|Although not as energetic or convincing as countrymen the Hellacopters, the Hives manage to meld classic protopunk nostalgia and new school punk rock delivery quite well. Veni Vidi Vicious is a worthy, if more subdued followup to 97's scorcher Barely Legal.<br />Songs like (the 3 singles, coincidentally) Main Offender, Hate to Say I Told You So, and Die, Alright concentrate more on the retro aspect, charging forward with great hooks and catchy-as-all-hell riffs that remind one of early 70s Detroit garage rock while still retaining a contemporary feel. Introduce the Metric System in Time, Outsmarted and Knock Knock recall some of the balls out frenzy that was Barely Legal, however, in many places it seems as if they're holding back, opting for cheesy mod riffs instead of distorted power chords.<br />The Hives ride their gimmick for all it's worth, and occasionally it can be a bit excessive... plus it tends to take away from their musical merits, whatever those may be. You gotta admit that the suits are cool. Here's to hoping that mainstream success doesn't destroy them. 3 1/2 stars.
B000063JDE|4.0|I suspect that serious collectors of all things Lynch will find it worthwhile to upgrade to this edition of one of his best films. If you're new to this director, 'Blue Velvet' or the recent 'Mulholland Drive' are (to my eyes and ears) the prime representations of his artistry, which has a distinctive palette and is not for all tastes, especially during family viewing occasions (well, depending on your family). I'll refrain from summarizing the plot lines, which interested readers can find elsewhere, and focus on the latest presentation.<br />I owned the previous MGM issue of this Lynch classic and aside from a lack of extras, the DVD was a good video and audio presentation. I vacillated about upgrading to this newly-remastered edition, my attitude fueled by cynicism (MGM capitalizing on post-Mulholland Lynchitis) and by some negative comments about the bonus interviews (which implied they were nothing but vapid fawning over Lynch's genius). In the end I bit the bullet and was pleased I did.<br />The new Lynch-supervised transfer is crystal-clear, the primary advantage being improved dark/light contrast. Since 'Blue Velvet' is a study in the light and dark aspects of the human soul, this is an appropriate enhancement. On the other hand, the new transfer did not strike these eyes as a major improvement in the color department, which was a particular strength of the original. Dollar for dollar I would probably not recommend replacing your old one solely on the basis of picture quality.<br />When I turned to the bonus interviews I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of the commentary, especially in light of the negative comments I alluded to earlier. Isabella Rosselini and Dennis Hopper, who play the two basket-case characters (Frank and Dorothy) in this film, come across with the most insightful remarks. Hopper had just emerged from drink-and-drug rehab when he took on 'Blue Velvet' and is candid about how his earlier drug experiences infused his mannerisms and reactions on the set. Lynch had originally conceived of using helium in the mask, to give a surreal squeakiness to Frank Booth's voice, but Hopper hated the way this sounded, so the idea was dropped. Hopper points out that he interpreted his gas-mask as a source of amyl nitrate or nitrous oxide, both of which are used for a temporary rush while doing the dirty deed. Lynch had never heard of such a thing, which only serves to illustrate another aspect of the Boy Scout behind some of the extraordinary (and often viscerally in-the-gutter) visions he conjures up. Rosselini describes, in some detail, a serious sadness and insecurity that came over her after the film was released, and no, it was not embarrassment over her nude scenes.  I appreciated the detailed accounts about other behind-the-scenes contributors, especially the late Alan Splet, who is responsible for the audio things that go bump in 'Blue Velvet'. Indeed, he was a long-time associate of Lynch, going back to 'Eraserhead', and the originator of the low-frequency rumble that infuses so much of Lynch's audio spectrum. <br />The other major bonus, a behind-the-scenes montage, is educational but not overwhelming. As other reviewers pointed out, it is not raw footage, but a sequence of stills, and your mileage will vary.  The package describes the audio as Dolby 5.1, and some audiophiles have questioned aspects of the surround sound. I'm content to just let my TV blare away, but if audio is of ultimate importance to you, you might want to dig deeper into other commentary before purchase.
B000066F6H|4.0|The Hives aren't a band that tries to pull on your heartstrings, or get your brain working with cerebral rock.  Rather, they aim right for the gut (or maybe it's a little lower).  Whether intentionally or not, the Hives seem to have channelled equal doses of the exaggerated dangerousness of British Invasion bands (the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks, etc.) and the tongue-in-cheek posing of the Ramones.  The result is an album chock full of bratty, in-your-face old school rock tunes.  The guitars are jangly, but that doesn't stop them from packing a wallop, and the backbeats are often simply pummelling.  Howlin' Pelle Almqvist tops the whole mix off with some throaty, aggressive shouts that give the songs a sense of urgency akin to an operating scene from &quot;ER.&quot;  Wisely, the band keeps things short and sweet at less than thirty minutes; getting in and out quickly was a good idea.  While this music may not be profound or revolutionary, I'm not sure it's supposed to be.  What it is is a rocking good time.
0792157850|4.0|As stated many times, the second film of the Indiana Jones trilogy is (by far) the darkest of the series. While Raiders was an extremely fun viewing of Dr. Jones having a fistfight with the entire German army, and Last Crusade was a lighthearted quasi-Parsifal with Sean Connery, Temple of Doom is a tense, truly disturbing (at times) adventure that takes place in an underground pit just a few feet above hell. And it's my favorite of the Indy movies.<br />Harrison Ford is brilliant in the role that he was born to play. Although the character of Indy is shrouded in macho trappings, this IS set in the thirties. So, I don't find the supposed \\"sexism\\" to be all that off-putting. Ford's considerable acting skills are greatly tested by Temple. There's a scene where Indy is being tortured by members of the evil Thuggee cult, and the viewer is absolutely disturbed by the scene. A lesser actor would have made this an exercise of pure camp.<br />Kate Capshaw is, quite frankly, a little annoying as Willie Scott. I don't think it's necessarily Capshaw's fault; her character could have been played by Audrey Hepburn and still would have been irritating. Willie, as remarked by some reviewers, screams her head off during most of the movie. Eventually, you kind of hope the bugs or the lava will finish her off. Still, some scenes with the character work. The opening sequence and Willie's behavior at the palace are charming.<br />Ke Huy Quan is pretty good as Short Round, Indy's temporary sidekick. Again, it's the character that is a bit distracting, not the actor. Ke Huy Quan is delightful in the poker scene with Indy in the jungle and is much more of a help than Willie could ever be, but some of the scenes of Short Round kicking the poop out of the cult members are a little laughable.<br />Amrish Puri is wonderful as the awfully evil Mola Ram. This guy makes Belloq look like Maurice Chevalier with such an intensely evil leer and rather septic heart operation procedures. Roshan Seth is also brilliant as the devious prime minister. Both of these fine actors are also in the wonderful movie \\"Gandhi.\\"<br />Philip Stone's character is something of a Col. Blimp, yet a very well acted Col. Blimp. I'm sure he probably listens to Elgar while sipping his tea in his bath. The rest of the supporting cast are also excellent: Lao Che and the Indian holy men are very enjoyable, if a bit one-dimensional.<br />The accusations of the film being racist are, in my opinion, a little silly. Yes, Hinduism is much more tolerant of a religion than Christianity could ever hope to be. As far as I know, there wasn't ever a Kali cult that performed human sacrifices, and it can be easily and convincingly argued that British rule in India was mostly malign. However, stating that all of the Indians in the film are portrayed as weak or devious is like stating that all the Germans in the other two films are portayed as cruel and militaristic. I can understand a person's sensitivity to such things, but since it's an Indy movie, naturally Indy is going to be portrayed as the wonderful savior while everyone else is reduced to being either dependent on him or actively trying to dispatch him. In my opinion, problems do arise when people (typically Americans) see movies like this and take them as real history. For instance, many Americans who have seen Braveheart now consider themselves experts on Scottish history. Occasionally, when I eat Indian food (which is delicious), I hear some bozo talking about eating monkey's brains, as was also stated by another reviewer. I can understand a person of Indian heritage being very irritated by such behavior, but I don't think it's entirely fair to blame the filmmakers for the behavior of some of the more stupid people who watch their movies. Hopefully, in the next Indiana Jones film, Indy will take on the scariest religious cult yet: America's religious Right. I can think of a certain self-righteous someone who could use a few good punches.is also brilliant as the devious prime minister.

0743442539|5.0|The Spy who came in from the cold provides an exciting introduction to the finest level of spy novel.  Le Carre introduces the burnt out agent, the pragmatic Control, and the all too human George Smiley.  The plot provokes, mystifies, and then draws you into the mind of Leamas, who now wants out of his espionage career.  The novel contains taut suspense, and a cast of riveting characters.<br />I read the book, I watched the movie, and then I continued reading Le Carre's other novels.  The Spy who came in from the Cold, like many other of his novels, probes deep into the mortality of what spy craft is, and the sacrifice of innocence by two opposing forces that are perhaps amoral, and seek only for one small triumph at a time.
B0000039PW|5.0|Tupac, Biggie or, Big Daddy Kane? The question for the greatest rapper still remains undecided among the rap world. Sure, Big Daddy Kane had the \\"bling\\" and, Tupac had the emotion and the thug mentality. However, neither one of them put it down in words like Biggie did on Ready to Die. Not only did it earn him a 1995 Billboard Music Award but, it portrayed Biggie's life struggle for what it was worth. In a story-like form and some of the greatest rhyming ever displayed on an album; Ready to Die is a must have for any rap fan. Even if you hate Biggie, your views will change after listening to this captivating album. With hits like Juicy, Big Poppa and, One More Chance; it is easy to see why so many regrad this album as the greatest. Showing that this 5 mic album (The Source Magazine) truly is Buisness. Instead. of Game.

B0000640WC|2.0|When I bought this two-pack, I hadn't seen Pearl Harbor, but my friends said it was good so I figured it was worth the price. I was wrong. Pearl Harbor is an awful movie; bad acting, bad directing, bad writing, bad action sequences, everything about it was just bad. With The Rock, it's the exact opposite; good acting, good directing, good writing, good action sequences, everything about it was good. I have no complaints about The Rock. It's a fabulous movie. Pearl Harbor: *1/2 The Rock: ***1/2
6305358613|5.0|I'm still not over Cate Blanchett losing the Oscar to Gwyneth Paltrow the year she was nominated for Elizabeth. She was robbed, and if you see Elizabeth, you'll see why. Her performance is really powerful, but it's the best kind of powerful -- it's subtle. She says more with a slight movement of her eyes and mouth than most actors do when they're screaming at you. Ditto Geoffrey Rush and Christopher Eccleston, who offer two very different takes on ruthlessness -- neither of which is simple or black and white. If you want to be amazed by Eccleston's range, be sure to see A Price Above Rubies (a seriously flawed movie with a couple of great performances) where he plays an Orthodox Jew in NYC. <br />Some people have criticized this film for taking some liberties with history, but it's not really that far off from fact and no more so than any other non-documentary film. They've definitely done some creative interpreting in places, but those embellishments are hung on actual historical truths about Elizabeth and that time in England's history. If you don't know much about Tudor England, it's worth reading through the helpful DVD insert packet to get some background before watching. Just as in movies like Braveheart and The Last Emperor, things are often clearer on the second viewing than they are first time around, but that's only because they're not wasting time with too much exposition. Elizabeth's writer and director trust that you'll get the important stuff, which you will, even if the history's new to you.<br />I really enjoyed the director's commentary -- that can be hit or miss, but in this case, it's enlightening and chock full of interesting details about the performances, camera angles, history, and more. It doesn't get much more complicated than shooting a period piece, and Kapur does a nice job letting you in on all the chaos behind what we see onscreen. The featurettes included also provide nice interviews with all the major actors.<br />I'm not sure why Elizabeth didn't clean up at the Oscars in '99. Maybe because it was a British production and didn't get the obscenely heavy PR push that Miramax gave Shakespeare in Love. Truth is, Elizabeth is one of the best \\"big\\" films of the 90s. It's the story of a woman whose birthright made her powerful in a time when women rarely wielded any political power at all, and it serves up a genuinely tragic portrayal of someone who sacrificed her own innocence and passions to become what England needed. The last shot of the film is an image of what most of us recognize as Elizabeth I (the pale, stone-faced Virgin Queen), but seeing this interpretation of how she got there turns that cold image into a haunting one.
B00005NVT1|5.0|This is one of the very few albums I've ever heard where people around me wonder what on earth is going on in my headphones whilst I'm listening. I can't tell you much detailed information about tracks etc, but I can tell you that it's impossible not to smile, nod your head, tap your feet and very difficult not to put your arms in the air. <br />It's blinding.<br />Live dance music at it's absolute best.
B00005O5CM|4.0|This is a terrific movie -- I first saw it in the theater and I hadn't laughed that much at a comedy, or enjoyed one that much, since &quot;My Best Friend's Wedding.&quot; I went to HLS and I was really surprised by how much the film got right -- yeah, it's a little exaggerated for the movies but most of it's dead-on. The place was ripe for a send-up like this (something to make us forget the awful C. Thomas Howell movie &quot;Soul Man&quot;) and nobody does it better than Elle. The scene near the beginning where she meets her little advising group on the lawn? Funny, but even funnier because all of those people are only about one Hollywood-notch up from the truth.<br />This could have been a mean-spirited movie, but it's not. I liked that we get to see Elle's kindness coming through as her most notable trait -- she's just really likable, and you feel for her when she goes from BWOC in L.A. to the fish out of water in Cambridge. Selma Blair does a nice job as an insecure classmate (and Elle's former boyfriend's new fiancee) who hates everything Elle stands for and is out-and-out mean to her until she figures out they have more in common than not. Luke Wilson is yummy to look at as always, and they have a nice cast of supporting characters (including the wonderful Victor Garber and Holland Taylor as profs). <br />The best thing about LB, though, is the nice job it does presenting a positive message (maybe even a slightly subversive positive message) about women supporting each other, standing up for each other, and encouraging each other in environments that are traditionally male-dominated. Watch the movie with that in mind and I think you'll see it ends up being one of the film's most important themes. If I had a teenage daughter, I'd show her this movie. <br />The dialogue is sharply written and doesn't pander, and while the film has its share of the easy laughs, it earns most of the funny. It's feelgood, fun, and like Elle, a lot smarter than you might think it would be. And Reese Witherspoon. Rocks. She's one of the best actresses around in this age group. <br />I'd reserve 5 stars for the Academy Award worthy flicks, but that's the only reason I gave it 4 -- it's a 5 for the enjoyment factor.
B000065U1N|5.0|I picked up a copy of Bowden's book long before it became a movie and I was riveted. When the movie came out, I was shocked that the moviemakers would portray the scenes so realistically. But it worked. One day, I was talking to a fellow worker and I told him about this movie I'd seen about army rangers. He replied that he was in the rangers for six years. When I told him that the movie was about the rangers in Somalia, I was met with a sudden silence. This co-worker told me quietly that he was there on October 3, in the city, wounded and fighting for his life. He described the detail. You want a review of this movie? He told me that he was not going to go see it. Why? Because he was there and this movie is real. Over a hundred American soldiers were sold out by the Clinton administration and eighteen paid the ultimate price. He was bitter. After several viewings of this movie, it truly is five stars and show be mandatory for every American, especially liberals.

Buy it now.<br />Oh, and for the guy complaining how &quot;unpunk&quot; the Hives were for not writing their songs:  Randy Fitzsimmons is (as far as we know) a fictional character.  Check their home page and it has a long and complicated story about how the elusive Randy put the band together boy-band style and then sent them bits of lyrics in the mail.

B000067IZ3|5.0|With cinimatic triump Traffic delivers! Filled with amzing crafing this film colaborates all the elements there are to make a dramatic movie. You have a father who is standing by the war on drugs(Micheal Douglas) and his very own daughter is taking drugs. A cop who is searching for answers(Benico Del Toro). A mother(Cathrene Zeta Jones) whos husband was taken to custity because he was involved with drug smuggling who will do whatever it takes to get him back. The picture is perfect for this film. In Mexico, the picture is grany,shaky,and brownish while in the U.S. it uses a darker light effect where everyone in the picture looks like a shaded blue. The script is well written. The direction was dead on. Traffic may not be something that you would expect a shoot em' up no brainers type of movie. You really have to be in the mood to watch this 2 1/2 hour flick. Now finally they have relesed this on DVD with a sharp picture and Dolby 5.1. I would get the Criterion Collection because of their 2 disc set and more stuff on Traffic than you would ever want! If you haven't seen Traffic, rent it first. It is what you call an Awards flick. It is on my best movies of 2000 list.

B000002I25|5.0|The Doors' debut album is one of the greatest in the history rock. So much of what Jim Morrison and the band established here has influenced rock n' roll and how it's performed for more than the last 30 years. In &quot;The Doors&quot; the band brilliantly portrayed a world of poetry, dark realms and romantic, sometimes violent visions. The opening, &quot;Break On Through,&quot; is exhilarating hard rock with a brilliant set of poetic lyrics (&quot;I found an island in your arms, a country in your eyes&quot;). &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; is a fun number with an edge. The following track, &quot;The Crystal Ship,&quot; is one of the gems from this album. It is hypnotic, romantic, poetic and timeless with Morrison's alluring lyrics and vocals and the band's overall playing, especially Ray Manzarek's dreamy organ work. The Doors also showed a wide variety of musical tastes here and it shows in tracks like the European-feeling &quot;Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar),&quot; taken from a German opera called &quot;The Rise And Fall Of The City Of Mahogoney,&quot; it shows the band were keen on art and the lyrics were fitting for Morrison. &quot;Backdoor Man&quot; is hard rock blues and no one has ever done a better version of this Willie Dixon tune. And of course, there's &quot;Light My Fire,&quot; the trademark Doors tune that everyone has heard at some point or another in their lives wether it be by The Doors or being covered by someone else. Of course this is the best version, the original with the classic organ intro and Robby Krieger solo. Though it pales lyrically next to many of the other songs, it is still a hypnotic, classic piece of rock history. A great song backed by great instrumentals.&quot;End Of The Night&quot; is a dreamy ballad, inspired by the novel by Celine, it is one of the band's best, most alluring songs (check out Rhea's Obsession's fantastic cover). The masterpiece here though, is still &quot;The End.&quot; It is one of the most hypnotic of all rock songs, itis a poetic, dark journey into unknown realms and for Morrison, it is a fitting homage to choas and self-discovery. The lyrics are unforgettable (&quot;Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain, and all the children are insane&quot;) and the playing oriental and groundbreaking. Morrison brilliantly adapts the Oedipus theory into it and comes out at his most menacing and deep. &quot;The Doors&quot; remains a timeless album, the music is still as alive today as it ever has been. So many artists like The Cult, Iggy Pop, Creed, Stone Temple Pilots, Bush, Billy Idol, U2, and many others are what this album helped inspire and will continue to inspire for years to come. Here is a true classic for the ages.

B0000027F8|5.0|Every artist has one defining album which showcases their true talent. This is George Michael's.  Simply put, this is one of the best albums made, and every song is unique, from the soul, and brilliantly constructed. It is entirely not what you think it is going to be before you listen to it. It's a shame that his follow-up album (once he freed himself from the recording contract that the song Freedom is about) wasn't even half this good.  You need this album in your collection. It's just that good.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Picking up where 1990's \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" left off,<BR>this greatest hits sequel starts up in 1992 during Madonna's<BR>\\"Erotica\\" album/\\"Sex\\" book phase.<br />Opening with a bang with the great post-disco dance gem \\"Deeper & Deeper\\"(from \\"Erotica\\"),\\"GHV2\\" offers Madonna's more sharper '90s material.<br />Among the best here is \\"Human Nature\\",\\"Secret\\",\\"Bedtime Story\\"<BR>(co-written by Bjork),and \\"Take A Bow\\"...all culled from one of Madonna's best albums 1994's \\"Bedtime Stories\\".Also worth mentioning are \\"Don't Tell Me\\",\\"Frozen\\",\\"The Power Of Goodbye\\"<BR>(a great song but milked by TV's \\"Felicity\\"),\\"Drowned World/<BR>Substitute For Love\\",and of course,the funky \\"Music\\"(one of her all-time best singles).<br />It's not shocking that Madonna offers up great greatest hits<BR>albums(also see 1995's \\"Something To Remember\\") because she's<BR>a singles artist,anyway.<br />Questionable omissions:\\"This Used To Be My Playground\\",<br />\\"American Pie\\",\\"Nothing Really Matters\\",\\"Fever\\",\\"Rain\\",\\"Bad Girl\\".I'm very surprised \\"Playground\\" wasn't included.<br />This is yet another must-have for big pop fans.I'd also recommend the two DVDs of Madonna's videos.
B00004XPPB|5.0|I'm not going to go in depth with detail after detail, but to put simply, this movie was everything I expected it to be.  If you liked movies like Goodfellas, you will probably like this one just as much.  It would be a great addition to any mafia collection.
6305350205|4.0|The initial reviews on this film were so bad that I didn't see it until 1995.  Someone owes William Shatner a huge apology!  While the storyline cannot be accused of being a classic, it is certainly superior to V'Ger or the whales in ST:TMP and ST IV.  This film is the best of the feature films because it excels at maintaining the flavor and strengths of the original series.  Shatner blends all the best elements: a provocative story, action, humor, and best of all, strong character interplay and insightful character development that centers on the Kirk-Spock-McCoy relationship.  This film's treatment of faith is the most positive ST ever made, which gives the movie a buoyant hopefulness in the face of human loss.  It also has a huge &quot;fun factor&quot; not present in most of the other films.<br />I urge you to give this one a second look and a fair shake.  Just because critics know movies, doesn't mean they know Star Trek.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I was afraid to see this movie. I was afraid that I'd be disappointed,afraid that this would be a farce or a live-action cartoon with no human interest and that it would kill everyone's perception of everything that the comic book medium could be.I wasn't sure about Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst being in the movie. I was concerned when I heard they were making Spidey's webbing organic and threw out the web-shooter idea. I became dismayed when I read that Roger Ebert only gave it 2 1/2 stars and at this point,almost had to be coaxed into seeing the film.You see,I'm a lifelong comics fan and Spider-Man is my all-time favorite comic book hero.I have grown-up with him. Peter Parker looks like me,and I've always felt that I was him. He was the first comics character I felt I could relate to. The comics have had their ups and downs creatively throught the years,but all in all,I've remained loyal to 'ol Webhead(J.Michael Straczynski and John Romita Jr. are really working wonders with the character these days) I almost thought we were going to see \\"Spider-Teen\\" or \\"Spider-Dude\\". I was afraid to see this movie.<br />Boy, were Ebert and I dead wrong! There were minor problems with it,I felt,but overall,\\"Spider-Man\\" was everything I had hoped it would be:the best darn comic book movie ever made. Roger Ebert felt that the action sequences were fake-looking and said that \\"Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon\\" handled this type of superhumanity more effectively.I felt \\"Spider-Man\\" captured Spidey's actions perfectly. In the movie,Spider-Man and the Green Goblin have the fluidity in their movements that reminds one of the Lee/Ditko Spider-Man era. Spidey fights like he does in the comics(throwing guys around,double-punches,etc.)and the Green Goblin is as sinister, dangerous,and cunning as a large predator on the loose. The fight scenes are choreographed well,evoking the fantastic and the brutal all at once. Any comics fan will be reminded of the immortal \\"Death Of Gwen Stacy\\" storyline during the chilling,final confrontation between hero and villain.New York becomes a character in its own right. Watching the film,you really get the impression that Spidey owns the Big Apple.The city is like an old,familiar friend to him as he effortlessly swings from rooftop to rooftop,looking for vermin that would soil or irritate NYC and the good people who live there(the scene where all of the citizens start pelting the Goblin with debris and such almost brought a tear to my eye). \\"Spider-Man\\" is as much a tribute to New York and its residents as well as the comic book form and Spidey himself.<br />I had been pulling for Freddie Prinze Jr. to get the role as Peter Parker,but Tobey Maguire's performance made me forget about all of that. Maguire evokes Parker's quiet,shy,sensitive personality perhaps better than any other actor out there and balances it masterfully with cocky,devil-may-care attitude of Parker's alter ego. Now, I can't imagine anyone else playing Parker other than Maguire.<br />The same can be said for Dunst's Mary Jane Watson. I originally thought that she would have made a better Gwen Stacy(Parker's first true love in the comics). After seeing her as Watson,I became convinced that she was the correct choice. Dunst really tapped into the fun-loving,starry-eyed yet troubled working-class girl that MJ has always been. MJ's a flirt and a dreamer,and Dunst made her come to life(I wish she would have said the line \\"Face it tiger,you just hit the jackpot!\\" like she did in the comics,but oh well).<br />I jumped for joy when Willem Defoe was pegged to play the Green Goblin,and Defoe doesn't disappoint. I was hoping that the filmmakers would build the costume and mask around Defoe's chisled visage(just look at that face,he is the Goblin! I love it!),however they opt for a \\"body-armor\\" look that works pretty well in its own right. Defoe's portrayal of Norman Osborne's madness is frightening. Defoe didn't turn the Goblin into a buffoon like others would have. Defoe's Goblin is deadly,swift,and truly an alter-ego. Defoe makes you believe that Osborne and the Goblin are two separate people inhabiting one mind. The Goblin mask speaks to Osborne,and Osbourne speaks back to it. He makes Osborne seem sympathetic,and in a way,almost tragic in the tradition of the great Marvel comics villains.Under different circumstances,Parker and the senior Osborne could have been like father and son,and Defoe as well as Maguire show that through their stellar performances.<br />All of the other performances are great too. From James Franco's Harry Osborne(poor,little rich kid),to J.K. Simmons' J.Jonah Jameson(I wanted to see Dabney Coleman play him,but Simmons fleshes him out well),and even Randy Savage as Bonesaw McGraw(The Macho Man is jakked in this one!). Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben is as loving as the comics character was,and Rosemary Harris turns Aunt May into the grandmother we all had or wish we had.<br />My beefs about this picture are minor. The score was totally wrong for this one. Danny Elfman sounds like he was doing another Batman film by mistake. There is nothing quirky about \\"Spider-Man\\",and the music should have reflected this. Spider-Man was to me the first \\"rock 'n' roll\\" superhero. Think about it,he defies authority,debuted in the early 60's(a turbulent time in American history),gets chased by cops,is misunderstood by elders,is full of bravado,is a smart-aleck,and is loved by the people. I wanted to hear electric guitars instead of a bouncy,pretentious orchestra. \\"Spider-Man\\" is set in New York,not a fictional city like Gotham where Elfman's music fit in better.<br />The Green Goblin's costume also takes some getting used to. Like I said before,I wished they would have taken advantage of Defoe's face(oh that face gives ya the willies,no pun intended). I would have rather seen a form-fitting mask,rather than the bulky helmet the Goblin is given here.<br />I have always loved heroes and heroism,fictional and otherwise. \\"Spider-Man\\" only reinforced that adoration. Spider-Man is our folk hero,an American myth,our everyman,and I think is in everyone of us. Peter Parker is the kid who we think is geeky,but is cooler than we will ever know. Spider-Man is the mousy librarian who plays in a heavy metal band by night,the housekeeper with a bestselling novel in her head,the accountant who dreams of being a director,hell,the construction worker who dresses in drag and sings Ethel Merman tunes while off-duty. Spider-Man is rock 'n' roll,romance,youth,daring,creativity,and anything anyone ever wanted to be when they grow up. The movie made this all clear.I hate to admit it,but I'm finding myself getting as choked up writing this review as I did while watching the conclusion of the film when I realized that they actually succeeded in making my favorite hero of all time come to life in masterful fashion.Watching the movie made me take a look into myself and realize more than ever that I too am Peter Parker and Spider-Man or at least wish I was.<br />\\"Spider-Man\\" is a sometimes harrowing,but ultimately wonderful film. Everyone will find something to enjoy in it. The action fans will rejoice when the battles take place,the romantics will fall head over heels with the love triangle,and those who just plain like a good flick will come away wanting to cruise the skyline of their hometown via webstrands.I want to personally thank all who were involved in the making of this picture. \\"We\\"(meaning comics fans) really needed this movie to be excellent. Not only did you all deliver,but you all seemed to have the time of your lives while you were at it.I want to see a franchise. I want to see Jack Black as Dr. Octopus,Henry Rollins as Venom,Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kraven The Hunter,Kevin Spacey as Electro,Ben Kingsley as the Vulture,Portia de Rossi as the Black Cat,Ed Harris as the Scorpion,and I could go on and on.<br />Go out and see this movie.e.

B00006690F|5.0|This is actually pretty amazing to me, because I'm not a big fan of the rap/hip-hop/r&b genre at all...in fact I dislike most of the genres offerings. But I had heard so much about this album and how great it is, so I decided to listen to it with my cousin, and I was really blown away at how much I liked Eminem's style. Regardless if anyone likes what Eminem stands for, or what he writes about, it's simply a lie to deny that he is an amazing artist with accents, syllables, and combinations of words. Without Me, the \\"single\\" of the CD is particularly amazing to me because of the incredible amounts of skill he really displays here. I'm thinking of buying this CD, and this will probably be the first and one of the few/only rap CDs that will ever see the inside of my collection of CDs. Eminem is a truly amazing artist.
0553213105|2.0|This was indeed one of the most foolish novels I have ever read. I found the conflict boring and without point, and the theme horribly expressed (was there any at all). Such that I find it amazing that the behaviors of an aristocratic woman in the 19th century wound actually be of interest to ANYONE. The themes are indeed NOT universal, and if anything, it should be derived from simple everyday life - there is no need to write a book about it. The infamous character portrayals seem hugely worthless. Such a book is suited at best for the coffee table.  Two stars because I never had the energy to finish the entire book, so I might have missed the so called \\"good parts\\" of it.
0679746048|4.0|I think I spent more time reading the documents of Susana's hospitalization than the rest of the book.  What is most intriguing is that it's a true story based upon the fact that she didn't belong in a hospital.  Read it yourself and decide if she was &quot;sane&quot; or &quot;insane&quot;...or if that is even something you can decifer.
0553213105|2.0|Such a book with themes such as reputation and class horribly expressed. The main conflict was worthless to begin with. Perhaps its just my tastes, seeing that every other reviewer gave this book 5 stars, I might as well, for the book's sake, give this book 2 stars.<BR>One word for you: Redundant!

0670215821|5.0|I read the book and listenned to the audiotape with L.J. Ganser as the reader/narrator. What a powerful experience! Mason's words and Ganser's voice made it seem like a friend was telling about his life. It brought back so many memories of a time when this country was in such turmoil and confusion. Robert Mason and I are roughly the same age and his experiences as a young man were so different than my own. The danger he faced while flying Hueys in Happy Valley is mind boggling. His ability to convey the experience helps others learn and hopefully respect and honor him and all the others who were put in that situation. It was an ugly, horrible time in our history.<br />His words come as close as any to describing the daily routine of facing death and the power of the mind to defend itself by using humor and diversions. Mason has done a masterful job. I think every American, especially the youth of today, should read this powerful memoir.
0062502182|3.0|This story is another quest tale and a nice parable. It was hard to put down. But once I finished it, I was disappointed. The boy follows his dream and learns many lessons he didn't expect. The quest would seem to be more spiritual than monetary even though it is the &quot;treasure&quot; that spurs him on. When the treasure does turn out to be monetary, I was really let down. Where is the real lesson here? His reward was his lessons and the finding of a soulmate. It wasn't really necessary for him to get gold too.  Also, his life was so easy. For the few times he was distracted or detered from his goal, there was a simple solution for him. And through it all, he could always go back to being a shepherd which he enjoyed doing anyway! I never felt his dream was challenged or in danger. He could have stopped anytime he wanted and still been happy. Most quests are things you can't live without, a much more driving force. The book never convinced me that he HAD to have that treasure. Is he just greedy? After all, what were his plans for it? Buy more sheep? He already had enough money for that. If he needed the treasure to provide for a big family, or use as a ransom for a loved one, or any noble reason, it would have been more suspenseful and understandable that he had to keep on. As a fable, the treasure should have remained a symbol of something else or he should have realized the money wasn't what was important. Having him continue on to find a chest full of gold, leaves us with nothing but a spiritually enlightened, yet still greedy boy.<BR>A better quest tale that also is full of spiritual truths is &quot;The Destiny of Miro&quot; which has many more trials and obstacles. These obstacles include the hero's own self-doubt which is something that really isn't included in &quot;The Alchemist&quot;.
B00005YUNY|2.0|This dvd has great sound....just like listening to the YES cd Magnification.  The video is just plain boring.  The only ones worth watching are Alan White and sometimes Chris Squire.  Jon Anderson is hopelessly annoying with his song anouncements and Steve Howe acts as if death is only minutes away.  I think he falls asleep during \\"Owner of A Lonely Heart\\".  And the creative input he gives this song is shameful.  It makes you wish Trevor Rabin showed up for a guest appearance!!!!! <br />Don't buy this for the video features or the extras, they are boring as well.  Close your eyes and it is not too bad.  I want to remember YES when they were young and vital and had some energy.  Oh by the way, did I mention this video is boring.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I saw this picture in my early 20's and it changed the way I watch movies.  This one crept up on me three days after I saw it and has rattled around in the back of my psyche ever since.  It's the surreal dreamlike quality of Lynch's vison that is the most disturbing.  I have yet to find another motion picture that captures this element so eloquently.  It's as if this man got inside of Dali's head and made a motion picture out of his grey matter.<br />There is always something acrid, hot, moist, dirty and fuzzy in that corner in the basement.  Don't look there, it's too horrible for words.<br />Where's the DVD?
B00003CXI1|1.0|It became unbearable to endure all the wholesale lifts from other material, including The Chronicles of Narnia, the Oz series, The Lord of the Rings, The Worst Witch series (especially), boiled down into a tasteless hodgepodge. There's not a single fresh idea in there, in concept or execution. However, the movie should have been somewhat redeemed by the supporting cast, behind-the-scenes talent and the production values; it wasn't. This series opener is a cynical, bland and charmless attempt at a family film. Where The Fellowship of the Ring film adaptation trancended the traditional limitations of the fantasy genre with its heartfelt performances and its themes of loyalty and sacrifice, Harry Potter seems a one-dimensional power fantasy with some flimsy moral lessons tacked on as an afterthought, like the public service messages you used to see at the end of children's cartoon shows in the 1980s. <br />There are a few excellent family films that have been virtually ignored the past few years, such as Kiki's Delivery Service, The Indian in the Cupboard and The Iron Giant. Buy one of those for your kids instead. The director's own Young Sherlock Holmes is far superior to the watered-down Grimm's Fairy Tale that is Harry Potter.<br />I have to admit, though, I did like Fluffy; I always was a [softy] for a three-headed hell hound. However, it's a shame the filmmakers felt they had to tone down the scary stuff like this to placate queasy parents; Monsters, Inc. was geared to an even younger audiences and had more genuine thrills, dealing with some of childhood's most primal fears in an truly entertaining and, for children, empowering way.
B00005JKMQ|1.0|I watched this on PPV last nite and spent much of the movie with the volume off. Too much bad music, no character development, Wil was wasted and the movie skipped the only thing that makes Ali an interesting person: his battle with Parkinson's and his advocacy for research. I dont even recommend renting it - wait till it's free on TV if you have some time to waste.
B00005U1YO|5.0|hey, i was wondering if any of you regular fans of hte chemical brotehrs could help me out...<br />a bunch of friends and i had loved this song a few years ago. we know it was by the chemical brothers, and we remember one lyric of the song, but we dont know the name of it or what album it can be found on.<br />it goes as follows:<br />&quot;hey boys, hey girls, superstar dj, here we go!&quot;<br />i appreciate any help
B00005RYKU|3.0|I'm a fan of Leelee Sobieski, and to me the greatest merit of watching \\"Deep Impact\\" was not a big meteo or some flashy CGI images, but just her presence.  For exactly the same reason, I watched this thriller, which turned out slightly better than what I expected.  <br />Just like her previous work \\"Joy Ride,\\" \\"The Glass House\\" works as unpretencious B-movie.  And this is not a back-handed compliment, for it generates some considerable suspence for all its ridiculous plot, which sets up its premise quickly with a orphaned Leelee's character and her younger brother, who are to be adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Glass.  At first, the new life seems fine, but soon Mr. Glass starts to show his true colors.<br />Most recommendable thing about the film is Leelee Sobieski's acting, which easily creates a likable, credible central character you can relate to.  And she even goes in for her sexy side, at one scene appearing in swimming suit (before she knew that someone is watching over her), just in case you're interested.  About other actors, I do not have much to say, except that the villains are played exactly like villains, and Bruce Dern, as everybody expects, plays his part of lawyer with a suspicious shade.  And, like me, for those who remember Diane Lane when she was a child actor, it is painful to watch some of the scenes her character is included.  <br />The shaky script has so many holes that you can pick up several points and say \\"Why don't you do this or that?\\" and it goes on and on, finally involves a crash scene with a high-speed cars on a mountain road, but owing to first-time feature director Daniel Sackheim (previously working for many TV series like \\"X-Files\\" \\"ER\\" and others), we anyway forget these things ... temporarily.  After all, this is a kind of entertainment that you saw in \\"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\\" and such thrillers, and while many ridicule them on the ground of implausible situation, others love them just on the same ground.  Enjoy it.
B0000041LL|5.0|I have been listening to this set of the Beethoven quartets since the mid-70's. I never tire of these performances. I have over the years purchased other performances of the Beethoven quartets by the Emerson, Berg, Borodin, and Takacs but the QI's version is the one to which I return. There are no other performances that match the QI's for balance and crispness, detail and passion, And I have always admired Franco Rossi, the cellist, for his wonderful singing tone --  especially in the Op. 59 F maj. I can only agree with the other reviewers praise of the late quartets especially the Op. 132.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This was one great movie.Spiderman is about a nerd that gets bit by a spider and becomes a hero.This movie is mostely about how spiderman got to be and is pretty close to the comic book story.Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker.Parts of the movie is funny when spiderman goes up against a wrestler named Bonesaw.I also loved the cgi effects when he is flying thru the air and jumping from building to building.Spidermans arch enemy in this movie is the Green Goblin which is played by William Dafoe and the green goblin is as strong as spiderman.I can't wait till Nov 1 when this is suppose to come to dvd.It will be a 2 disc set and I hope it will include the deleted scene of the world trade center.
B00003CXI1|2.0|The Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is only ok because it fails to capture the magic of the book. In addition important elements were left out while some casting decisions are terrible.<BR>For example:<br />Hermione (Emma Watson): They chose cuteness over accuracy so she isn't as bossy or intimidating as she should be. She does not look the part..too cutesy.<br />DumbleDore (Richard Harris): Harris didn't want to do this part but his grandaughter made him and it shows. He is too subdued and there is no twinkle in his eye. Very bad compared to his performance in Gladiator.<br />Ron (Rupert Grint): Only makes weird expressions throughout the movie..you call this acting?<br />As for leaving out important stuff..wasn't it important for Harry to know why Snape hates him? Leaving out the Snape's poision obstacle was very wrong too. The DVD should have given us the full 4 hour version.<br />Anyways I have high hopes for the next installment..I heard it is Chris Columbus' last. Yay!

0385484518|1.0|This book is enormously popular. It is also, I'm afraid, close to being completely worthless.<br />But how can a book be worthless if it's such an acclaimed best-seller you ask? That's like asking how Millie Vanilli could be talentless if they sold 7 million albums. Alas, mass popularity does not determine the value of any intellctual enedeavor, and often is a measure of its emptiness.<br />To see why this book isn't very rewarding, consider the following scenario. You find out that a book was written about a philosphy professor who spouts simple platitudes about the need for love, the beauty of the world, etc. Would you be interested in reading the book? Probably not, because the \\"ideas\\" espoused by the \\"philosopher\\" are banal and simplistic, however well-intended they may be. <br />But now, imagine that you find out that in addition to the \\"philosopher\\" dispensing simplistic arguments, he also dies and call his adherence to his ideals \\"life's greatest lesson.\\" Now, all of a sudden, you have a hugely popular best-seller on your hands. Now, suddenly, you have \\"Tuesdays with Morrie.\\"<br />Mind you, I'm not belittling Morrie. I'm sure he was a fine and kind man, and put forward his ideas with the very best of intentions. It's also sad that he died. But the mere event of his death alone cannot elevate his teachings to the level of philosophical profundity. His ideas can only be evaluated on their own merits, not in the light of his unfortunate death.<br />Some people, nonetheless, will maintain that this book has great originality in framing the death of Morrie, a philosophy teacher by profession, as his last and greatest lesson. Actually, that's been done before, about 2,350 years ago, to be reasonably precise. The Greek philosopher Socrates also maintained that his death, an execution by the Greek state, was the greatest expression of his philosophy. A certain fellow named Jesus who lived about 400 years later also seemed to think of his own death (at the hands of the Roman state this time) as the supreme example his teachings to mankind. In both of these cases, the lesson is all the more potent because the teachings themselves were so much more potent. The ideas of both Socrates and Jesus posed enormous provacative challenges to the entire culture and ideology of their time, so much so that many people were shocked by the implications of their ideas. <br />It's hard to imagine anyone being similarly shocked by the bland, trite teachings of Morrie. In the final analysis, it seems that much of the popularity of this book is based on a human emotional need to cry over the loss of a \\"loved one,\\" even one like Morrie whom we never actually knew. But those of you who want genuine spiritual or philosophical insights will be better served by spending your time reading Plato, the Bible, the Bhagvad Gita, the Tao or some of the other true classics of human thought.
B000066C1N|5.0|I loved the movie &quot;Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron.&quot; Then I bought the CD. It is great! Is has 15 suspenseful tracks, and I almost cried while listening to this CD because if you have seen the movie, you know there are a lot of sad parts. But this CD is probably great for all ages. My favorite songs on the CD are Here I Am (End title) and Get off of my back. If you loved Spirit, you'll love this CD! <BR>~Bunny<BR>P.S. Bryan Adams is sooooooooo cool! ~^_^~
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is great. It is witty and humurous but also gives some insight. No matter if you are a bit strange, you will suceed in life. And you have to pay attention from the beginning... to figure out what goes on in the end! I hadn't noticed a few details at the start and wonderered how some things happenned but the secret was finally revealed. When French want to produce a humurous movie they know damn well how to do that. Go see it and you won't regret it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Spectacular, spectacular is right. This film is just that. Moulin<BR>Rouge at times could seem as insanity at its finest, but if you<BR>listen closely and focus to the movie, you'll understand it <BR>better than anyone else. Nicole Kidman is awesome and sexy in <BR>Moulin Rouge. Ewan Mcgregor is serious and dark. If you hadn't<BR>already, SEE THIS MOVIE. YOU'LL LOVE IT **** (OUT OF 4)
B000002MG1|5.0|\\"Automatic for the People\\", the album most often described as R.E.M.'s Magnus Opus, is a beautiful, moody piece. It opens with \\"Drive\\", beginning with a simple guitar lick, and building to a thunderous crescendo complete with searing string section and crushing guitar solo. The lyrics, simple; the instrumentation, elegant and complex. This perfect blend between words and instruments characterizes all of R.E.M.'s work, most movingly on this album. \\"Everybody Hurts\\" builds off a simple background riff to make a truly moving anti-suicide song, ending as emotionally as it should, with an electric guitar coupled with a cry of \\"Hold on\\" repeating off into the distance. (In stark contrast, \\"Try Not to Breathe\\" seems to be almost about euthanasia, with Michael Stipe stating \\"I have lived a full life, and these are the eyes that I want you to remember;\\" almost completely opposite views, yet equally felt)<br />Perhaps the bit of praise most delivered to the album is that the pair of songs at the end are the perfect ending. The piano ballad \\"Nightswimming\\" is the only ode to skinnydipping I know of, but if there were hundreds lurking just beyond my knowledge of the musical world, I would doubt any would be anywhere near as awe-inspiring in its ability to transcend its subject and make something so beautiful and reflective. \\"Find the River\\", on the other hand, is as beautiful a song as one can find, uplifting and sad, deftly mixing a choral \\"oh\\", piano, flute to create a truly inspiring sound (unlike nowadays, when often a guitar, a piano, and one synthesizer effect make a song sound cluttered.<br />Although the album is mostly gloomy, it is not a one-note album; indeed, there are many degrees of sorrow. \\"Star Me Kitten\\"'s sorrow is that of a soulful electric guitar, while \\"Sweetness Follows\\" features a superb interplay between cello and acoustic guitar. Only two songs aren't inherently sad: \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite\\" is a easy-going, fun ditty in which one can here a laughin Stipe's voice; Ignoreland is a rocker about politics, though the lyric \\"I feel better having screamed, don't you?\\" suggests you ought not take it seriously<br />All in all, a monumental album.
0380788624|5.0|This book is such a great mix of almost science fiction<BR>and historical fiction.  Very unusual in how it portrays<BR>violence and physical achievement.  Loved it.
0553260111|5.0|I usually do not purchase books of this genre (i.e. action/suspense), but I decided to buy this one because the commercials for the movie looked great. I had no idea when I opened the cover to this book that it would be one that I could not put down or stop reading. I am thoroughly impressed with Ludlum's ability to pack so much action into literally every page of this book. It may seem intimidating, being a 500+ page book, but I was able to finish it in a week and a half. The story is constantly twisting and turning, and you are left wondering what will happen next at the end of each chapter.<br />All in all, I would highly recommend this book to ANYONE even remotely interested in this genre of books, or even in the film. Robert Ludlum truly proves himself to be a talented author above many others.
B000065U1N|5.0|I've read through alot of good reviews here. so mine will be short. I admire the movie for being truthful about war, how the soldiers show fear, (as in life) there aren't any cheap attempts at patriotism here either. no one liners. In a sense I felt I was watching a documentary of the events that took place in 1993.<br />the movie showed our soldiers unbelievable bravery without sugarcoating the facts. I felt a lump in my throat when the two soldiers dropped down out of the helicopter to try and save their fallen brothers, against hundreds of enemy militia. I have never seen bravery displayed on cinema in any manner like the bravery shown in this movie.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This album is amazing, i will never get bored of listening to it. My favourite song on the album is slave for you, its a real good song to dance to. I also really like the song boys, again its got a real good beat and in some respects is also a touch on the hip hop side. <BR>   Basically i love this album and can't get enough of it and neither can my friends! I also especially like the last track that Britney did with Justin, it is excellent. I hope Britney lasts for a long time and produces more music to this high quality, definately a 5 star album!!!
B00005JKLZ|3.0|First i have to say that HG Wells Time machine is my favorite book,so nacheraly i was keen to see a new version on film. I was slighty alarmed to see that the producers had changed the original location of the story from Britain to the USA,which i think changes the whole flavour of the story,though i think verry little effort was made to keep the story faithfull to Wells masterpece.Though taken on it`s own as movie entertainment it comes throug with the goods. Though i would love to see an acurate version of the book brought to the screen,thoug i fear we will probably have to wait another fourty years.
B00003CXI0|4.0|I found this movie to be exciting . It has to be my 2nd favorite movie by far . First is Titanic of course . This movie almost made 1 Billion in movie sales . Unbealevable? just try Titanic that was the best selling movie in Theaters right now that made 1.8 Billion Dollars . <br />(Clears his throut)Now back to the subject . For all the Harry Potter fans...Just go ahead and buy the video , I'm possitive that u'll enjoy it . These are my ratings for the movie....<br />Graphics:9/10<BR>Tiny parts of the movie could've done better.<BR>Sound:10/10<BR>The music is wonderful . Fully orchestrated music .<BR>Replay Value:10/10<BR>I'm sure that u'll want to see it again and again.
B000009EAD|4.0|I like Iced Earth.  Their brand of Iron Maiden/Metallica inspired power metal combines everything good about no-nonsense 80s heavy metal.  In many ways, they are the true heirs to the Iron Maiden and Metallica thrones especially taking into account that Iron Maiden hasn't released a meaningful album since Seventh Son (Brave New World notwithstanding) and many think that Metallica gave up the title of heavy metal kings when they released Load (or the so-called \\"Black Album\\", depending on your point of view).  Either way, Iced Earth is arguably the best thrash-inspired, Iron Maiden influenced band around today and even though they aren't as technically intricate as Metallica once was or as melodically brilliant as Maiden used to be, Iced Earth almost always delivers a solid album.  Something Wicked This Way Comes is no exception.<br />1. \\"Burning Times\\" - This is the best of the heavy, thrashier songs on the disc.  This song reminds me of some of the stuff off of Iced Earth's 1996 disc The Dark Saga.  Good song and it rates an eight out of ten.<BR>2. \\"Melancholy (Holy Martyr)\\" - The best song on the CD, \\"Melancholy (Holy Marty)\\" begins the slow verses/fast chorus songs that make-up half of the disc.  This discs emotional impact is stunning as vocalist Mathew Barlowe delivers a heart wrenching performance.  This song is most definitely a ten!<BR>3. \\"Disciples of the Lie\\" - \\"Disciples of the Lie\\" is too thrashy and fast for my taste.  Normally, this isn't a problem, but the vocal melodies are too harsh and aggressive.  My least favorite song on the disc.  It only rates a five out of ten.<BR>4. \\"Watching Over Me\\" - Much like track two, this is another stunning song that delivers emotional, ballad-like verses with a powerful chorus.  The song is about the death of a close friend of guitarist Jon Schaffer.  The subject matter alone makes one pause, but the music is so inspired and compelling it makes the song standout even more.  This song is a perfect ten. <BR>5. \\"Stand Alone\\" - A thrasher that never lets up, \\"Stand Alone\\" is an unrelenting and powerful tune that features vocalist Mathew Barlowe at his most aggressive which makes this song one of the best thrash numbers on the disc.  This song ranks an eight out of ten.<BR>6. \\"Consequences\\" - Another song that ha a ballad-like verse coupled with a heavy chorus like that of tracks two and four, \\"Consequences\\" doesn't quite deliver like two and four did.  Still, it's a decent tune with plenty of power in the heavy parts and adequate melody lines in the slower parts.  A seven.<BR>7. \\"My Own Savior\\" - Iced Earth's greatest strength is also their greatest weakness: Their aggressiveness can sometimes result in over aggression.  Many Iced Earth fans will disagree, but this over aggressiveness can sometimes hurt the song as it does here.  This tune gets a seven.<BR>8. \\"Reaping Stone\\" - Starting off slow, this tune picks up at the chorus with Barlowe's powerful vocals and Iced Earth's brutal guitar riffs.  It rates an eight.<BR>9. \\"1776\\" - An instrumental, \\"1776\\" is an engaging and domineering track that is both brutal and inspiring.  This one showcases some interesting runs and riffs and even a flute!  Good stuff and it rates a nine.<BR>10. \\"Blessed Are You\\" - The slow verse/heavy chorus theme continues here on one of the albums best tracks.  The vocal melodies are particularly powerful and the guitar parts sound like the were lifted off of Metallica's album ...And Justice For All.  I give it a nine (out of ten).<BR>11. \\"Prophecy\\" - The first song in the \\"Something Wicked\\" trilogy breaks the pattern that was present in the first ten songs as it follows the recipe used on the slower, even numbered tracks.  When it finally does turn heavy, it's as aggressive as most of the odd numbered songs on the CD. A good tune that I give an eight to.<BR>12. \\"Birth of the Wicked\\" - A steady heavy rocker, \\"Birth of the Wicked\\" is a solid song that features dynamic vocal melodies and punishing riffs.  An eight.<br />13. \\"The Coming Curse\\" - A quiet piano opens \\"The Coming Curse\\", but it quickly shifts into all out speed and power.  Good track even if I've heard it's like earlier on the CD.  Some of the instrumental passages are very engaging and there are even some haunting female and male Gregorian chants later on in the song.  I'll give this one a seven only because it is a bit too over the top for me.<br />Something Wicked This Way Comes, as many before me have noted, alternates from heavy thrash to slower semi-ballad rockers with every song: The odd numbered songs tend to fall into the first category, the even ones in the latter.  Some fans were slightly annoyed by the up and down nature of the song order.  I think it's a good way to order the songs and I like the breather in between the thrashers.<br />Iced Earth delivers another solid album of classic-styled power metal in the vein of their 1996 CD The Dark Saga.  The rhythm guitar parts are especially good as Jon Schaffer is clearly from the James Hetfield (Metallica) school of rhythm guitar.  Mathew Barlowe is one of metal's most versatile and powerful singers and sounds like a cross between former Savatage singer Zak Stevens and Metallica front man James Hetfield.  Something Wicked This Way Comes is another solid American power metal release.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is not a heavy love movie like Titanic.  The main plot is all about \\"teasing\\" She teases him, he teases her.  I saw this movie with 2 good friends of mine, both men.  I started crying at the end of the movie.  The best part of the movie was the animation of the pictures on her wall.  They speak to each other, when she is sleeping. I suggest that you see this movie with someone you love. Watch this movie and then watch it again, and again.  I personally don't think you could sick of it.
B000002HPT|4.0|Falling Into Infinity has received so many harsh critiques from Dream Theater fans that the idea of trying to write a positive review seemed too big a mountain to climb.  So with some trepidation, I sat down and finally wrote a review of the CD knowing that I was up against a lot of negative analysis people have given this album.<br />1. New Millennium - This mid-tempo rocker has an intriguing Middle-Eastern vibe to it thanks to the keys and vocal melodies.  The song is fairly light (as far as complexity) but contains an interesting undercurrent of darkness which adds depth to the overall feel of the song.  Good song.<BR>2. You Not Me - Although track two does feature some catchy rhythms and atmospheric keyboards, this mid-paced songs cheesy, cliched chorus is a turn off.<BR>3. Peruvian Skies - A slow, ominous opening begins this song.  The vocal melodies are haunting and do a good job of utterly capturing my attention.  As the song progresses, the pace picks up and the band breaks out and delivers a powerful performance.  Its one of Dream Theaters best.<BR>4. Hollow Years - A song that features a moving performance by vocalist James LaBrie, Hollow Years is one of Dream Theaters best ballads.<BR>5. Burning My Soul - Though the lyrics leave a lot to be desired (something that plagues post-Kevin Moore Dream Theater), the music and the overall Awake feel to this heavy rocker more than make up for its weaknesses.<BR>6. Hells Kitchen - A good instrumental that approaches musical masturbation, DT reins it in enough to make this a solid if somewhat less than inspired track.<BR>7. Lines in the Sand - The song sounds promising in the very beginning, but has trouble taking off.  However, guitarist John Petrucci does pull off a moving guitar solo in the middle of the song and the second half of the song does have better melodies thus saving Lines in the Sand after a slow start.<BR>8. Take Away My Pain - Though this track has some excellent vocal melodies and some interesting musical bits scattered throughout, some saccharine moments both lyrically and musically take away from the songs overall impact.<BR>9. Just Let Me Breathe - A heavy rocker that has some splashes of creativity and Awake-like aggressiveness, this song still fails to deliver.  Its the less than inspired vocal melodies and the mundane technical flashes that do this song in.<BR>10. Anna Lee - Nearly as brilliant as Hollow Years, this well-crafted ballad is another testament to song writing winning out over musical masturbation.<BR>11. Trial of Tears - This epic starts off quietly with a soulful guitar solo.  LaBries vocals soon come in as smooth and graceful as ever.  The song has a nice rhythmic flow to it that is dynamic and calming at the same time.  The song also contains some wonderful and beautiful instrumental stretches that are intricate without being unnecessarily complex.<br />I dont understand the harsh reaction that Falling Into Infinity still receives from many Dream Theater fans.  To me, Dream Theater continued where Awake left off as the band crafts some wonderful songs here.  And while Dream Theater would forget most of the lessons they learned here when they made the dreadfully sloppy Scenes From A Memory (excessive technical masturbation couldnt make up for weak songs but many fans still fell for SFAMs technical cover-up of SFAM's complete lack of depth), this album remains a CD of well-crafted melodies and moving music.  Fortunately, Dream Theater would rediscover song craft with 2002's Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  So my final word on this CD is that it is Dream Theaters third best disc only ranking behind the masterful Awake and the inspired Six Degrees.  While it would be wrong to totally ignore the negative criticism Falling Into Infinity receives, read some positive critiques of this album as well and then go purchasethe album and make up your own mind.  One last note: It seems to me that keyboardist Derek Sherinian, who departed Dream Theater soon after Falling Into Infinity, was an unfair scapegoat for both the fans and the band.  I mean, cmon, Sherinians post-Dream Theater work is arguably more progressive and inspired than anything Dream Theater has done since Sherinian left the band.  Its regrettable that Dream Theater and many of their fans have tried to distance themselves from this wonderful CD.
0679736646|5.0|One of his best- shifting realities kick ass. Read this book. Now. You won't be sorry. And read The Man in the High Castle, and The Minority Report (sstory).
B000065U1N|5.0|Even though it's a very intense movie to watch due to all the shooting that goes on in the movie, the result is very good and Ridley Scott is very acurate with real events.  I highly recomend this movie.
0812550706|5.0|An excellent read- but be sure to get &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; also...it's a parallel novel that should be read with Ender's Game fresh in mind...both are in my top 5 all time best list.
B00005QDW1|1.0|Rock Steady is actually a kind of music. It's half way between Ska and Reggae. Basically, it's slow soulful Ska with the horn section replaced with piano or keyboards and more prominent base. Needless to say this ain't rocksteady. <br />I'm sorry Gwen (if you read actually care about your reviews), you've got a great voice, and you're a sexy kick ass chick, but calling this album Rock Steady is a slap in the face for people who actually like real Rocksteady and Ska. It's like Metallica calling an album Blues. No Doubt was once a Ska band, but they changed their style because you can't sell Ska. Like Reggae, Ska is just too exotic for the average 13 year old American. It probably wouldn't make me as angry if No Doubt didn't keep the Ska image (including the word rocksteady), and if magazines like Rolling Stone didn't act like they *grew up* by changing their style of music. There are some very talented bands today that play Ska in different styles, and they don't get airplay except on college radio, while this crap, Gangsta rap, and teeny bopper music is forced on us.
B000062TU1|5.0|...I would think that all Harry Potter fans would find this movie as wonderfully adapted and enchanting as I did.<BR>First of all-the acting was superb! How could anyone say that those such as Robbie Coltrane's acting was flat? He, not including looking the stature and gruffness of Hagrid to a tea, was the best portrayal that they could have possibly found for the role. Really-who else can copy Rubeus Hagrid's accent to such a caliber?!...<BR>The kids, Daniel Radcliffe,Rupert Grint and Tom Felton were excellent for their roles-especially Ron, who was played to the at most perfection-he even looked how I imagined him!! Emma Watson is a little too pretty to be Hermione (I always imagined her much plainer,) but she plays Hermione's cleverness and frank scoffs with flair. <BR>And lets not forget the actors who portrayed Percy Weasley (who was very business-like and only lacking his Horn-rimmed glasses) The Weasley Twins Fred and George, (both very convincing, though most of their very very funny lines were sadly cut out) and Oliver Wood (who besides being very cute, has a nice Scottish accent that adds to his personality. Great Quidditch captain!!)<BR>Second of all: The special effects were awesome-especially the Quidditch match, played, AT LAST, before your very eyes in full-fledged velocity!! I was thrilled to the tips of my fingers, and found that to be spelled out spectacularly in stunning visual effects. Fluffy, though clearly a computer generated three headed dog, was nice and vicious-big teeth and lots of slobber on Ron's shoulder added to his personality. <BR>Third of all: They kept all crucial elements in the movie that made the book what it is!! What did they take out, may I ask? They added all of the characters, their great acting and great specail effects, along with keeping all of the best parts and leaving the message that warmed our hearts in the book in the movie. \\"It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to our enemies-but even more to stand up to our friends...\\"<BR>...At least I know what this movie is-a spectacular,enchanting, (even though not perfect, but honestly movies can never be as good as books) adaptation to a classic that will live on forever in our hearts and minds! Harry Potter-THE BOY WHO LIVED!!<br />oh yes, and P.S.-Ian Hart did an amazing job as Quirrell-I thought he deserved more credit than he got for his wonderful portrayal. I mean, Really, Who else could scream \\"TROLL IN THE DUNGEONS!!\\" so effectively!?
0064471837|5.0|Yes, J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels are really good.  But Garth Nix is better.  As a matter of fact, I would go so far as to say that he is the best living children's writer alive followed by J. K. Rowling, Lemony Snicket and I expect Neil Gaiman's Coraline to be a smash hit as well.  When I first picked up this book, I expected something good and it surprised me; it surpassed my expectations.  This is action-packed and there is not a boring moment.
B00005BCPC|1.0|Being a very big fan of Jane Austen, I find this loose adaptation an abomination and an abortion.  But then, I have never understood why people will pretend to do a movie of a book only to rewrite the book as something else.  Why not just do an original movie?<br />Since I know the book well, I could not really tell what the video would be like for someone unfamiliar with the story.  But it seemed to me that it must seem quite incoherent.  The Price character is certainly incoherent - one minute docile, the next impertinent, one minute cynical and the next ready with  a conservative moralism.  She is cold and cruel enough to sneer at her aunt's drug use, and to her younger sister (can you imagine such behavior in an Austen heroine!!!), and then we are to believe her the most virtuous and kind and of the tenderest conscience.<br />Unsatisfied with the staunch, consistent, quiet, gallant and unsensational courage of Austen's character, these folks had to make her cutely coy and clever and for good measure (in case anybody might get bored with English country manners I guess) had to throw in a subtheme of the evils of slavery.  Seldom have I seen so silly and useless a scene as the one where Fanny suddenly finds on her cousin's sickbed (where did it come from?) a large sketchbook full of scenes of slaves (her uncle's one presumes) being tortured and raped - by her uncle, amongst others.  And poor Cousin Tom, is transformed sentimentally into a gallant idealist emotionally crippled by his discovery of the source of Dad's evilly gained riches.  Oh please.  Austen was brilliant, this is rubbish.  Can people not tell, and refrain from trashing her?  Does the aunt have to be made an opium addict?  Yes, people abused it back then, just like people had slaves in the West Indies back then, but can't we do without drug abuse and gross violence for a couple of hours?<br />Get the BBC video starring Sylvestra Le Touzel, it is immeasureably better.  I found her characterization ofFanny Price faithful and yet never insipid, as her rather prudish moralizings risk seeming to people today.  Nobody has yet made Edmund interesting, but oh well, Lady Bertram is lots of fun, a real Austen eccentric of selfishness.
0767817478|4.0|Those of us with a clue are obviously laughing hysterically at the reviewers who say this is a clone of Jurrasic Park and/or were dissapointed to not see a shakespearean effort here. This movie wasn't meant to be such! It's based on the original Godzilla flick (Which predates JP by almost 50 years!), about a lizard mutated to monstrosity by nuclear testing... And based on that fact... The makers of this film did one helluva job! It's an action packed special effects romp with some cheese. That's what it is, and that's what it was meant to be! So brew up some of that &quot;french roast&quot; coffee, sit back, and enjoy, if this sounds like your thing!
6304383827|2.0|Too much a vehicle for Paltrow, and too little a vehicle for Austen.  The Beckinsale A&amp;E version is much better, and I'm not sure that the BBC version was not the best - I cannot decide.  But this one is superficial and unsatisfying.  Too vague a Jane Fairfax, while Frank Churchill is sometimes too flashy and sometimes too dull and lumpish, while the relationship between these two is undeveloped.  Miss Taylor is too young and foolish, and Mr. Knightley looks still wet behind the ears - no match for his Emma.  Emma is too pretty and Harriet not pretty enough, the hypochondriac father, so richly and amusingly portrayed in both the other versions, is just thrown away here, while the Harriet Smith character is rather wooden and the Harriet-Emma relationship lacks most of the humor Austen wickedly portrayed in it - which the other two versions bring out very well.  I will say, I do like the portrayal here of one of Austen's prize jerks - the ineffable Mrs. Elton.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Believe it or not, Radiohead is in a bit of a difficult position. Though they fully displayed their ability to manipulate sounds, and their willingness to challenge listeners with \\"Blow Out\\", the cataclysmic sound warped final cut from their underrated debut album \\"Pablo Honey\\", the first two albums the band put out where decidedly Pop-rock. Not just Pop-rock, but perhaps alongside Weezer as one of the best Pop-rock bands of the middle 90's with \\"Pablo\\" and \\"The Bends\\". But after the pleasure their experiment called \\"OK Computer\\" garnered from both fans and critics, Radiohead went artsy with \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" and is now the trailblazer for the new genre titled Post-Rock. And, as stated before, leaves them in a bit of a tricky position. Many fans of the earlier pop-ballads are turned off by the avant-garde sounds of Post-Rock, while many of their newfound fans are uncomfortable with the less aesthetic sound of their earlier attempts. This is the fix many bands find themselves in when attempting to both grow and challenge themselves and their fans.<br />It did, however provide for one of the most original and brilliant albums of the 90's and indeed, all-time, \\"OK Computer\\". Stuck right smack between their Pop and Post-Roack days, Computer contains the best of both worlds, a challenging, artistic album with an unconventional pop flair. Perhaps the song that most reflects this position is \\"Paranoid Android\\", an epic that neither gives into pop-sentimentality and structure, nor refuses to allow itself to become utterly infectous and singable. And that's just, as they say, the scratch of the surface. \\"OK Computer\\" is jammed full of tunes that are both easy to listen to and challenging for listeners at the same time, making itslef a bit of an irony.<br />The first, and only, Post/Pop-Rock Album, this is a must addition to your collection.
B000060P79|5.0|I bought this Cd yesterday and I love it!!!The music is \\"SIMPLE\\" the lyrics transend gender lines.The good thing about this cd compared to some is that you dont feel like you have to forward any songs they are put in such an order that it just flows>I would say anybody that owns Good Charlotte,binK,MxPx or New Found Glory BUY THIS IT IS JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN THESE BANDS CDS!!!!!!!!!
B000065V1V|5.0|You can break Bowie's career into 3 parts:  His undeniable world-altering genius in the 70's, his pop star-cum-lost artistic soul of the 80's, and his constant search for the sound that suits him best in the 90's and beyond.  Which brings us to \\"Heathen.\\" <BR>Read any review of \\"Heathen\\" and 2 out of 3 reviews will mention something along the lines of \\"...his best work since Scary Monsters.\\"  I dare say, when it's all said and done, \\"Heathen\\" will rank right up there with his all time best -- it's Bowie FINALLY recapturing the sound and magic that made listeners drop dead in their tracks.<BR>  It's one of these albums that gets under your skin and you can't escape.  Listen to the sublime simplicity of \\"I Would Be Your Slave,\\" or the achingly beautiful \\"5:15 The Angels Have Gone,\\" or the bombast of Neil Young's \\"I've Been Waiting for You,\\" or the kitsch of \\"Gemini Spaceship.\\"  It's all here in it's full glory.<BR>  To hardcore Bowie fans, if you were to put \\"Low,\\" \\"Hours...,\\" and \\"Scary Monsters\\" in a blender, you would have \\"Heathen.\\"
B00005QK3W|3.0|I approached \\"Driving Rain\\" with a combo of excitement and skepticism.  After Paul's remarkable \\"Run Devil Run\\", where (with the help of some nice studio eq-ing and tweaking) he found his voice and soul again he sort of lost me w/his Concert in the Cavern, where his painfully flat singing sucked the life out of any excitement at seeing him play in the Beatles seminal stomping ground. The song \\"Freedom\\", played at the Benefit Concert for NYC further lowered my expectations for the album. And so it is - a decidedly mixed bag - an album filled with good ideas, clever harmonic changes, superb playing, solid production yet weighed down with empty (in some cases just plain awful) lyrics, half thought out song concepts and a return to recording Paul's voice straight up, without any of the equalization he so BADLY needs now.  \\"Lonely Road\\" is not a bad beginning, and the ragged edges around Paul's voice work well in the context of desperation and being left behind by a lover. His screaming at the end of the song is particularly effective.  It goes downhill pretty quickly from here. \\"From a Lover...\\" may not be McCartney's worst song ever, but it's certainly one of his most peculiar. I understand the odd time signatures and stops and starts were an attempt to maintain the \\"flavor\\" of his own personal demo of the song, but the tired, dragging melody barely supports the ambitious arrangement and the \\"la la la\\" bridge is just bizarre - nearly tuneless and ragged. That he chose this as the launching pad for this album is ridiculous.  \\"She's Giving Up Talking\\" is another painful song, but for different reasons.  The atmosphere is intriguing, the dropped tuning creating a genuine air of menace, yet Paul does nothing with this.  While his melody is solid, the words go nowhere or (YES - the 'yap yap yap' nonsense)detract from the song with their oafishness. The song \\"Driving Rain\\" is probably MOST illustrative of this.  Take out the '1-2-3-4-5' crap and you've got the most vital andexciting McCartney song in years. His singing is strong, the production soaring and he sounds genuinely excited. But the LITERALISM that has dogged Macca his ENTIRE career just kills this. '12345, let's go for a drive, 6789-10'...and not just to kick the song off with an exciting count in, but he repeats this lyrical empty-headedness again and again.  More than anywhere else on this album, this song makes me want SO MUCH MORE from Paul McCartney. There are plenty of flashes of his musical brilliance. \\"About You\\" is the hardest piece of original rock his recorded in years and \\"Magic\\" is charming and has a 60-ish sway to it. \\"Your Way\\" sounds like an outtake from \\"McCartney\\", his first solo album, and benefits from a stripped down arrangement and some fine playing and singing. Even the Quasi-Wings tune \\"Heather\\" worked for me. The musical interlude sounds genuine and joyous from Paul and his goofy sentimentality is kept in check with the brevity of his lyrics. He sounds happy and at peace on this song, which we all wish him. \\"I Do\\" illustrates how his vocal powers have degenerated. His falsetto is raspy and, while he does manage to stay in key, he sounds withered and spent here. Perhaps intentional, given the songs melancholy undertone. Unfortunately, except for \\"Spinning on an Axis\\", which is unlistenable and the atrocious, dumb ('a right given by God'????) \\"Freedom\\", the rest of this album is filled with forgettable songs, destined to be banished to the pages of the McCartney songbook and never heard from again.  Paul - PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE just take the time to write in words, some of the poetry in your music and marry the two again.  Ultimately, this album left me feeling shortchanged and irritated. It won't be a regular in my CD player.
B00005OMTT|3.0|Where are the singles: &quot;Eyes of Truth&quot; (from &quot;The Matrix&quot;), &quot;Rivers of Belief&quot;, and &quot;Mea Culpa Part II&quot; ? Oh wait I forgot, we still need to buy the original albums, right ?<br />This, even though &quot;Mea Culpa Part II&quot;, the classic follow-up single to &quot;Sadeness Part I&quot; in 1991, isn't even available in its single version aside from the (out-of-print) 1991 CD single. This would have been a nice opportunity for a re-release<br />But leaving out &quot;Eyes of Truth&quot; is inexcusable altogether
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is a mordern day fairy tale with a big, smelly, ugly orge as its hero, and a wise-cracking talking donkey as his sidekick.<br />  Shrek (Mike Myers) lives in a swamp alone.  All that changes when fairy tale creatures are at Shrek's door.  Shrek learns that Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) has forced the fairy tale creatures into Shrek's swamp.  Shrek goes to see Lord Farquaad  (with Donkey, Eddie Murphy) and tells him to get rid of all the creatures in his swamp.  Lord Farquaad sends Shrek on a quest to rescue the beatiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Dias)  from a castle guarded by a fierce dragon.<br />  A great comedy!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I went and saw this Special Edition of Beauty and the Beast when it was in the I-MAX Theaters.  It was absolutely incredible!  There's just something about being totally surrounded by the sights and sounds of this incredible movie that thrills my heart.  Beauty and the Beast is an enduring classic that screams for recognition.  I think it is high time that Disney produced another classic film like this one.  I personally believe that the musical scores of their last few films are cheap and weak compared to the classics like Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast.<br />This special edition it a must for Beauty and the Beast fans.  It includes brand new footage and a completely new song that was cut from the original movie.  If you liked the original, you will love this new version.  The DVD is loaded with extras about the movie and the Broadway version of this story (which I have also seen and loved).<br />BUY THIS MOVIE!  It's an all-time classic!
B000060MY6|2.0|Contrary to popular opinion, my feeling is that \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is derivative rather than original and pretentious rather than profound. In the spectrum of phantasmagoric settings, Los Angeles is a johnny-come-lately. The French were doing this sort of thing a good while ago--and much better. (Try, for instance, \\"Celine and Julie Go Boating.\\")
B00005QIPH|4.0|as a teen in the schizophrenic world of music today, I had never known what music genre was me. what music had defined me as a person, and what had made me comfortable in the every aspect in the person that I was growing to be. then, one night at a friend's house, i heard &quot;Last Night&quot;. this song had the energy, enthusiasm, and thoughtfulness that I had come to find in myself. i ran out and bought the cd, and as soon as I got home and listened to every single track all the way through. this cd was who I am. it felt that every thing that I thought and felt was being put into a song by these guys. <br />the stroke's &quot;is this it&quot; did not necessarily change my life. it helped me find a musical identity. music is an important part of my life and I feel more like an adult now that I have found my niche in the music world.<br />I think it is extremlly hard to say whether an album will be a turning point in music history. everyone has a personal album or song that speaks to them and lets them into a new world of awareness. an album that is crowned a turning point in history is only because it had the power to touch so many people at one time. albums from the beatles and nirvana have been popular turning point albums because they were also a commercial success. i have a feeling that the strokes may be forgotten with the next britney spears cd, but they will always be the turning point for my in my musical history.

B000059GEH|5.0|This is one of the best Romantic/Comedys that I have ever seen,Marilyn Monroe is wonderful in this movie.This movie is for anyone who is looking for a good comedy that will make you laugh through the entire movie, ''HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE'' is the best choice.
B000065U1N|3.0|I loved the movie (and the book), but if you're buying the DVD expecting any special features, think again.  They didn't even bother to include the trailer!  Sure the box says &quot;theatrical trailer(s)&quot;, but those are two trailers for other movies!  There's a 10 minute behind-the-scenes bit, but it's really just a quick character introduction by the actors -- pretty useless if you've already seen the movie and paid any attention to the characters.  Audio options, etc. are minimal.  Some work went into the menu screens, but they suffer from what many DVD menus suffer from: slow menu navigation due to animations during transitions from one screen to the next.  It was nice to watch the first time but has just been infuriatingly slow ever since.  I'm glad to own the movie, but the DVD is disappointing.  I'm wondering if I should have waited for a &quot;Special Edition&quot;.  Maybe they're withholding the features for a later release to cash in a second time...
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is a film about haunting -- and it will haunt you.  (It kept me awake all night after I watched it.) A wonderful, little-known cast combine with David Lynch's mastery of disturbing imagery to create an unforgettable experience.<br />The film has a reputation for being illogical, impossible to figure out. Not true! Its plot is constructed with all the rigor of a Greek tragedy. Just remember: dreams have their own logic; wish fulfillment is a large part of that logic; and to understand a dream, you have to know who the dreamer is.
6305313687|1.0|Apparently, I am one of the few who didn't think this movie was a work of pure genius, or even muddled genius.  While Edward Norton's performance is worth watching, he can only do so much with the dialog he's given and the formulaic change-of-heart plot.  Bad Ed seethes with free-floating hatred and takes off his shirt a lot, exposing a torso in an advanced state of Nazi buffitude; Good Ed keeps his orange prison jumpsuit zipped and acts like Gandhi wearing a \\"kick me\\" sign.  Ed Furlong is, as usual, excellent as a troubled young man with adorably floppy hair.  <br />The message of this movie seems to be, \\"Racism is bad, but...\\" with the \\"but\\" semi-legitimizing a thin thread of White Right whining.  Prior to watching this movie, I was of the opinion that most citizens of the USA had given some thought to ideas about race and \\"fairness\\" and the murky area where these concepts intersect.  So how to explain, then, why so many reviewers have been \\"blown away\\" by this simplistic, patronizing piece of [junk] posing as a serious look at a serious issue?  I don't feel any different about racist behavior than I did prior to viewing this film; I am completely creeped out by how many people seem to have needed this stupid film as an impetus to change their thinking.
B00000K19E|2.0|Of course the movie is good, with much suspense and movement, the special effects are great as usual, Keanu Reeves is very, very charming... But we can't keep saying that kind of thing. So I'm gonna put some middle critics about it. And there's quite much to say.<br />The Wachowski brothers are fond of John Woo, kung-fu movies and mangas, and we can see that. We can see that so well that in fact nobody saw nothing at all. Actually the movie's been made under the entire influence of Hong Kong cinema. Open your eyes and you'll see that the story itself is taken from the famous Japanese manga and film \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" (a hacker pursuited by an overpowerful cyber-agent - doesn't this remind you something?). Open your eyes and you'll see that the action, shooting sequences have been taken from John Woo movies, especially \\"A better Tomorrow\\" and \\"The Killer\\" (Keanu Reeves throwing his empty guns away and replacing them, imitating Chow Yun-Fat). Open your eyes and you'll see that the fighting sequences have been taken from Hong Kong kung-fu movies, especially Tsui Hark ones (\\"Once upon a Time in China 1 & 2\\", with Jet Li); besides they've been made by a famous Hong Kong choreographer... the same one who worked on the Hark movies, and on \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\"!<br />As we know, Hollywood has become a master place in the art of imitation and recovery. With \\"The Matrix\\", the big shots can say they made a totally innovative movie (some others said 'the best sci-fi movie ever made') which's gonna be inspiring many unimaginative directors in the future (see \\"The One\\"). But they forgot (and not only them) that the movie itself owes Asian cinema very much, if not everything. For me \\"The Matrix\\" is not a new and innovative film, but a smart pack of sequences already seen before in other movies made a very long distance away from Hollywood. But people don't care, so we can say that the Wachowski brothers did it great. In any case the movie doesn't worth \\"Blade Runner\\"and other great futuristic movies \\"The Matrix\\" unsuccessfully tried to bury.<br />About the actors, I noticed Hugo Weaving's amazing performance as the brutal, ferocious, pitiless agent Smith. He manages to keep away from caricature and makes his bad character one of the most believable and scary ones, in action movie history. But when I see him fighting and flying all over around in a perfect, high-class suit, I have some doubts. All I can say is that in the end, Neo can't do anything else but crush him when he at last gets aware of his great powers. Lawrence Fishburne, as the charismatic Morpheus, is excellent too.<br />So I'll say that after their very personal and imaginative first film, \\"Bound\\", the Wachowski brothers, as many others like Bryan Singer, blew up their style and sold their souls to Hollywood. \\"The Matrix\\" is quite a good movie with a good plot borrowed from mangas but with a too obvious influence of the kung-fu, John Woo and manga styles, and with a bouddhist background (Morpheus' speeches). There's nothing much to be deadly admirative about. The special effects are perfect but too present and heavy and bring bad headache, along with the deafening music. But this is what people want to see and hear, so what's the big deal? As long as it brings big money...
B000063UR2|3.0|When I originally saw this film back in the 80's I remember thinking - What a shame such fantastic imagery has been ruined by bad story and poor dialogue.  (Slow mo prancing  Unicorns too cool). As a fan of director Ridley Scott, (best known for Blade runner and I applaud him for taking a chance on a experimental fantasy film. I just wish they'd made a better more cohesive experimental film.  The music by Tangerine Dream is very much of it's time, but subtle enough to not distract from the film. However whenever there is talking, or lyrics, as in the title song or basically anything pertaining to the plot, there's a breakdown in to trite fantasy-land silliness, through which some of the most ardent fantasy fans have found trouble maintaining suspension of disbelief.  Best suggestion, If you appreciate great imagery, really like fantasy films, and have a bad habit of watching them with your brain turned on - watch  Legend, just turn down the TV volume. You'll be fine...  until near the end, when you see Tim Curry's enormous prosthetics flopping as he runs.
0393317552|5.0|This is one of my favorite books; I'd put it in my top five.  This is not to say that I necessarily subscribe to all of the author's arguments.  I've discussed this book with others and have read many critical reviews, and understand that the book and its arguments are not perfect.  Nevertheless, it offers tremendous food for thought, regardless of whether you agree entirely or not.  It is especially instructive for people without deep backgrounds in history and science.  This book is a well-written and enjoyable exlpanation for why certain societies prospered instead of others.  Its greatest value is that it provides evidence that environmental factors influenced history significantly, which is helpful for balancing outdated racial arguments among others.
B00005OAIE|5.0|after reading the reviews that consider mayer's cd as \\"trite\\" and the artist as a dave matthews wannabe, i can only be led to think that these people are either too old or too young for this cd to speak to them. as a 25-year-old, the lyrics sure do speak to me. maybe you have to be in that quarter-life crisis to seriously want to run back to high school and tell them all that *you* figured your career out, and you didn't take the road that the guidance counselors suggested after analyzing your answers to those stupid personality tests. and while you may have one aspect of your life under control, other parts are up in the air -- the dating you sacrifice by moving to an obscure town to further your dream, the romantic pitfalls you encounter when you meet someone who makes you feel safe in a big city (i had a city love, too, and when i walked away from him, i realized i wasn't so dependant on him after all.) i guess what i'm trying to say is that mayer's lyrics seem to capture the confusion of your mid-20s in a way i haven't heard in a while. whether you can relate probably depends on how closely you listen and how old you are. but it has nothing to do with dave matthews. if i thought he sounded like that \\"trite,\\" i wouldn't have bought \\"room for squares\\" in the first place.
B0000025GW|5.0|Unfortunately, overlooked within the Dylan album catalogue (along with Saved and Shot of Love) as being \\"too preachy\\" or \\"Christian based music\\".<BR>What interests me greatly is how many (if not all) of Dylan's past albums were sung with deep passion and sometimes anger when trying to bring forth a message. The difference here, whether it be in media circles or some Dylan fans is that it is interlaced with Christianity. <BR>OH MY SWEET LORD, WHAT SHALL WE DO, WE CAN'T THINK FOR OURSELVES AND LISTEN TO AN ALBUM WITH AN OPEN MINDSET. <BR>In my view (as a singer), not to be able to say that this album or \\"Saved\\" or even \\"Shot of Love\\" is not some of the best musicanship and singing from Dylan ever (despite the message that so many people seem to so despise or shy away from) is criminal. If this album were sung about anything else, and I mean anything, with the same zeal and passion that Dylan has here, it would be acclaimed as a masterpiece.<BR>Yet, I'm kind of glad that it isn't, because as a Dylan fan, I can honestly say that I have a gem that other people are afraid to listen to or get near because they don't agree or can't handle the message.  <BR>If you just appreciate good passionate and heartfelt music and are a fan of Dylan, get the album. I would have more respect for people who actually buy the album and say, well hey, it wasn't one of my favorites, rather than someone who doesn't listen to it at all because of its theme.
B000002U82|5.0|Where many progressive rock artist fail, Pink Floyd never failed. To say this album is solely a progressive rock album doesn't do it any justice. The genre of progressive rock is intended to be a genre in which artist are allowed to transcend music to a level that goes beyond one understanding, with crossing into mainstream. Like it or not, musicians and artist alike want to make money (no pun intended here). However, it is in the same vein where the listener can take out the music so many different meanings that there isn't one correct way to feel when you here it. There are so many different elements that Pink Floyd uses on this album that it is hard to pick out which one to focus on. Many people say that this album is a eulogy/tribute to former frontman Syd Barrett. You can hear it in the songs, especially Brain Damage/Eclipse, The Great Gig in the Sky, and Us and Them. But more importantly this album signifies the journey through one's mind and one's perception of reality, as seen in Time, and Money. Other people have said that if you watch The Wizard of Oz, and place the volume on mute, and then play this album is the ultimate trip. I have not done that, yet. But whatever method one uses, this is a album that no matter what genre you like this is a must for any music library.
0060245867|5.0|I found that young children enjoy this book when they are resting and are relaxed. I always like to read it during those times.
0767805712|5.0|I really liked this movie, because I am one of two children, and while my brother is almost like Vincent's brother, I believe that personal ambition, discipline, want, desire,...that those things all effect overall success in life.  This DVD, though not with super special effects etc., reveals something about human struggles...not just that humans struggle, or why they struggle, but also the sweet taste of success, the &quot;why&quot; to trying.  Why do get get back up after being kicked down?  Because definately, not just &quot;maybe,&quot; if we keep trying, we WILL make it, it WILL pay off, even if there are sacrifices, even if there are hardships.  That is what this movie shows, and I like it for that.  No, it's not as action-packed Matrix-like film, nor is it heart-wrenching like Braveheart, but LIKE Braveheart, this shows that there are costs, and like Matrix, it shows that the good guys CAN win, and that the power of mind is everything.
B000009MF7|5.0|Ravel's Piano Concerto in G was the work that convinced me to start taking a serious interest in jazz. I don't know whether it has had anything like the same effect on the tonally ascetic Pierre Boulez, but we should all be genuinely grateful for his masterful guidance of the Cleveland Orchestra on this wonderful recording. Rich and detailed, the orchestral sound ideally complements the striking sensitivity of Krystian Zimerman's performance. (Boulez feels this work in his bones, a fact which leaves you sensing that he is suppressing an unexpected dimension to his musical personality in some of the more ideological postures he strikes on twentieth century music.) <br />As ever, the approach of the soloist is critical. Zimerman makes his initial allegro attack with aplomb, and he pulls off the concluding, dynamic presto with equal attitude. But is in the heart-wrenching adagio, around which the whole work revolves, that he is at his strongest. While not technically exhausting, this is a difficult movement to perform to its full potential. But Zimerman's timing, leaning off the elusive beat to exactly the right degree, is magnificent. <br />The eight Valses are a charming distraction (no disparagement intended) upon which the Cleveland is able to shimmer and shine. They clean the palette for the dark, pounding feast that is the Concerto for Left Hand. <br />This is not my favourite recording of the Left Hand Concerto, but it comes pretty close. What it lacks in menace it makes up for in exquisite detail and panoramic scope. And quibbles aside, this surely amounts to a definitive recording of these three great works.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is a wonderful new band straight out of Canada (yes, that's right folks, blame Canada). Powered by teen-angst lyrics, a great melody and 5 good-looking guys, what's not to love? In songs like &quot;I'm Just a Kid&quot;, their first single off of their debut album &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot;, the lead singer, Pierre Bouvier, sings about life as a kid whose not apart of the &quot;in-crowd&quot;. He makes the listener feel as if &quot;Hey, so maybe I'm not the ONLY un-popular person in the world&quot;; he relates to the listener. In more heart-felt songs, like &quot;Perfect&quot;, he sings about the pressures that parents can sometimes place on a child. With appearences by Joel from Good Charlotte and Mark Hoppus of Blink182, this cd will probably the best thing you bought for anyone, including yourself. So, if you'e feeling sorry for yourself, or you want to listen to an up-beat song with entertaining lyrics...go buy Simple Plan's new cd.
0671656244|5.0|I first read this book in 8th grade, and it changed my outlook on a lot of things. Haviland Tuf is really Plato's philosopher king, inaccessible and yet all knowing. Challenged constantly by ordinary men and women with inflated views of themselves and thier universe, Tuf's reactions to problems lends an insight into our own media-based, over-sexualized violent world. His solutions in the face of man's progressive collective ignorance shines a light on our own shortcomings as a society, and we come away screaming for more. GET THIS BOOK!
B000065U1N|2.0|This movie lived up to the hype of best sound and it had some great action sequences. but i turned it off about 3/4 through it because it just didn't hold my attention.  same thing over and over and over, without actually going into why that happened.<br />all in all, boring movie.

0066620694|5.0|The author explains the innovator's dilemma in true Harvard style with case studies.  And many of them.  He addresses all the key issues about the dilemma, starting with the difference between sustaining &amp; disruptive technologies.  He explains how a company may identify a disruptive technology coming on and how it can best strategize with its resources, values &amp; processes to handle the new technology most effectively.  He takes the reader through detailed case studies of several industries -- disk drives, excavators, minimills, etc.  He also provides specific examples of companies that have dealt with such changes in the past -- IBM, HP, Apple, etc.<br />His analysis of companies that have proven themselves successful through a wave of disruptive technology provides insights about what a company must do differently ... in terms of managing its resources, processes and values.  He also compares first-to-market consequences for both disruptive &amp; sustaining technologies.<br />Having worked for both a big company &amp; a startup myself, I can appreciate the differences between the two establishments and how each would deal with technology changes (sustaining or disruptive).<br />He does a great job of explaining how companies could fail by doing all the &quot;right&quot; things -- listening to customers, planning a certain growth rate, projecting demand, etc.  He explains how customers could adopt a completely different technology overnight leaving companies in the lurge.<br />This book is not just about the tech industry -- it offers insights on how companies can effectively deal with changing technologies.  If you have ever wondered what it takes for a company to be constantly on top of things, and how some companies seamlessly adopt new technologies while keeping their customers happy and their financial goals right-on, this book is for you.
B00005NW02|4.0|I have never heard any other rock that sounds like SOAD, and that's why I like Toxicity. Chop Suey! is a good example of this, as is Psycho and Aerials(my personal favorite). Needles and Bounce are the funny songs on the CD, but for very different reasons. Overall, very good.<br />For someone who wants a fresh hard rock band with a completely different sound, and one that is as far away from mainstream pop as it is possible to get, buy &quot;Toxicity&quot;.
B00005JKG7|4.0|I have to admit, I like this film even better than Halloween.  A tight script and worthy cast are both good for starters.  Most of all, however, it is the absolutely superb photography and atmosphere (courtesy of Director Carpenter and his wonderful Director of Photography)that makes this one a classic.  Most all of the performances are good--particularly Hal Holbrook and Janet Leigh.  Only drawback is Adriene Barbeau as the heroine, who presumably got this role in true Sondra Locke-like fashion from then director/hubby Carpenter.  I've never seen her give an unaffected, unmannered performance, including this one.  Jamie Lee Curtis, from Carpenter's earlier Halloween and here relegated to a supporting role, would have been much better in the lead.
B00005J6UP|4.0|Ok I admit It. Im 13 and I just saw this movie for the first time a month ago lol! I really didn't think I was going to like it. But I told myself It was made in the 80s it cant be that perfect right? But it had everything a great movie should have drama comedy suspense. The goonies movie Is awesome!
074322454X|5.0|Dry telling of an excellent story.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|...The movie.  I saw it, originally, in the theater in a sneak preview.  Coincidently, I got a free soundtrack out of the deal.  The movie in the sneak preview was not the same as the one on the video, or the DVD (the movie was also changed a bit after the sneak preview for the theaters),  and I left the theater with mixed emotions.  Then I went home and popped in the soundtrack.  I needed to see it again.  I saw it two more times in the theater, and fell back in love with it.  I then waited for the DVD, and I also picked up the video, to lend out.  I have since picked up the second soundtrack, and am much pleased with all of the above.<br />Ewan McGregor is the absolute best looking, and sounding, in this movie, over any other movie he's been in.  He is so charming, and adorable, you just cannot help but to fall in love with him.  Nicole Kidman is beautiful, and I was pleasantly surprised by her in this movie.  The rest of the cast is unforgettable, in my honest opinion, and did an excellent job with the music.<br />For those of you who think the characters are caricatures of the real thing, well, YES.  This is a musical, after all, and you obviously have not seen a single musical if you go into this movie expecting it to be like any other movie.  And for those \\"manly men\\" who think this is just another \\"chick flick,\\" I got one of my best male friends, who is masculine to the point of uber-testosterone, to LOVE this movie.  I was surprised.<br />I absolutely adore this movie, with the colors, the costuming, the singing (even though the music isn't original, Ewan, Nicole, et al really make the songs incredible, and I am finding myself humming Your Song even now), the acting...  and I am creating more addicts to this movie.  So, for every person who hates this movie, at least five love it.<br />I also do not have ADD, do drugs, get drunk watching this movie, or any other excuses people who hate this movie throw at those of us who love this movie.  I think it is an incredible work of art, and I am grateful that I have something right with my brain that allows me to take this movie at face value, loving it all the way.<br />I am getting off my soapbox now, and await the taunts and jibes that come from the MR-haters...  with a chuckle for the amount of misspelled words that are sure to be flung at me.
6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the shell is a cyber punk anime that mingles machines and flesh so tough that no one really is pure human. It has a real good amount of action in it and also a though provoking anime. It starts out as a female cyborg cop thats going after a enemy called the Puppet Master problem is its hard to tell where or who he is. He messes wit peoples minds and stuff to make um do whatever he wants them to, soon near the end the Female Cop has to make a decision. Its a very good anime wit some nudity (but name an unedited anime that dosen't, besides Pokemon) so i would recommend it for 16 and up. My only downside is i wish they would make a sequel. :}

B00005N9CV|2.0|She has a great voice.  It's time for her to start doing some music of her own, and not copy other great female voices anymore.  I have never heard such a pretentious interpretation, singing as someone who has the most marvelous voice on Earth and trying to make it sound special.  Not a bad CD, but just very boring and pretentious.  You can almost see her singing: &quot;I'm the best, screw the rest !&quot;.  Very disappointing.  Don't waste your money.  Go for Vanessa Rubin instead (Female Talk).
B000063CPL|5.0|First off I still dont get why so many people dislike Gers. Sure he is a much different kind of guitar player then Adrian, but that doesnt mean he ruined the sound and is a bad guitarist. I think one main problem people have with Gers is that he is very jumpy on stage, which can lead to some fair cheesyness I suppose, but that doesnt mean he needs to be kicked out, trust me Gers is what get the crowds going, compared to Smith especially.Myself, have been playing guitar for 15 years now, and Gers is one of my main influences, why? Well because nobody in the world sounds like him, he has the most rawest sound ever for a metal guitarist, and he is a mix of both Murray and Adrian together. He dreads the guitar fast and relentless like murray, then plays very smooth with a melodic style like smith. Most people I know find it hard to believe that Jannick would ever play a nice textured solo because of how wild he is, but its true, he does. Alot of people also say Gers lacks melody, please!! Maiden have had much more melody then ever when Gers came in the project, just listen to the songs off here: Ghost of the Navigator-a very complex song, opens real melodic, then the jamming comes in place fast. Then gers's solo on this song? Huh? A horrible guitarist, not a very good guitarist? Listen to the solo again, and you tell me this guy isnt a good guitarist, and that is just one example of one of the songs songs off this album, like Dream of Mirrors which is perhaps the most complex maiden song ever aside from Sign of the cross. No offense to Smith, but he could only dream to be able to play guitar solos so fast and raw with the bridge like Gers, and dont think I am an adrian hater, I love him about as much as gers, I think I feel more love for gers's playing since he is always criticized.This album is unique, Maiden havent gone in a new direction and will never be in a new direction, so they added some more melody over the years, and started out slower on most of their songs,big deal!! That doesnt mean maiden are soft, in a new direction, or too old. It just means they made their music more complex then before in the 80's. Also why do people think the band is keeping gers if he is such a horrid guitarist? Come on, if gers was such a bad guitarist then he wouldnt be with maiden now would he?<BR>The first person to leave the band if it came to it would be smith, since he was lucky to being able to rejoin the band in the first place, of course I hope that never happens either. Gers might change some of his solo work around live, but that is ok, his solos are very complex to play, trust me. Try playing Ghost of the Navigator, The clansman, or any other song with his solos, tell me these arent complex solos. I also think one reason why gers is also to have said to be out of tune, flat, or lack of melody, is because he has a very raw sound. That doesnt mean he is in any of those errors, like I said he just has a raw sound, and it is very unique, some metal heads will have to just get into it more, while others should just fall in love with it instantly. Maybe if gers would be a little more calmer when playing on stage, then maybe he wouldnt be criticized by most people, however I dont mind it, he does what he does, and best too, and like smith said about gers on a practice guitar vid I saw, when he was describing the differences of Murray's playing as well as Gers, &quot; Gers isnt afraid to play the guitar and plays the hell out of it, the way it should be played&quot;<BR>Jannick haters please give him more of a chance. UP THE IRONS!!
0440219078|5.0|The Giver was a great book!  And I don't really like to read books.  But The Giver was different.  It contained tons of interesting scenes.  Therefore I recommend this book to everyone who can read.<br />                  READ         IT!!!!!!!
B00003CXA2|5.0|I have watched this movies many times. No need to mention the humorous plots and lines, the beautiful pictures, the excellent acting, and the span of various historical backgrounds in this movie, which make it indeed the top in the film-making history. What I like the most about the movie is its philosophical taste of life. It makes you think.<br />Forrest Gum is really just a common person, not too bright, not too aggressive, but nice to every one. There seems nothing that  he persists, and there seems no goal in his life. He goes to where life takes him. But he is not a loser, he ends up with success and luck beyond what he expects. His all-time love, on the other hand, forming a great contrast with him, always pursues her dreams, tries hard, and experiences all sorts of frustration, without a happy ending. It really makes you think how one should live his life. <br />I like the scenes of the feather in the wind. That carries infinite taste of life. The more you watch the movie, the more you will feel the taste, and the more you will like the movie.
B00005M91K|1.0|This movie was boring. I don't honestly don't understand how anyone could like it. The soundtrack was just a bunch of nature sounds albeit edited very well. It wasn't a music soundtrack.<br />Unfortunately, it's this that causes the movie to be nothing more than a glorified one-hour documentary on the Discovery channel.<br />Koyaanisqatsi is a lot better. It's got Philip Glass that goes very well with the scenes.
B000002G7E|1.0|I've noticed that all the so-called negative reviews  of this terrible slab of excrement receive non-helpful ratings. Excuse me, but aren't all reviews helpful? It seems to me  that the only people who read the reviews of this     godawful s!?t are those lonely, confused few who think this is actually a good album.  What a deluded bunch. If you like this cd, try some early Sonic Youth. LOL!
B00004Z459|5.0|I'm sick of the critics bashing Linkin Park, saying that they are just another nu-metal band. Yes, they are a nu-metal band but the point is, is that they sound completely different from all other bands and they manage to be unique by blending different types of music. Hybrid Theory is easily the best album I've ever heard. Every song is great, and they all sound different from eachother. Thr band consists of a singer, rapper, DJ (etc), drummer, bass guitarist, and guitarist. <br />1. Papercut: 8/10 (The perfect song to begin the album; it's fast and loud)<BR>2. One Step Closer: 8/10 (Probably the most heavy/angry song on the album)<BR>3. With You: 10/10 (At first, I didn't like it but it grows on you. It's one of my favorites)<BR>4. Points of Authority: 10/10 (One of the best songs)<BR>5. Crawling: 10/10 (Easily my most favorite song on the album. It's very catchy and has an awesome chorus)<BR>6. Runaway: 7.5/10 (Sounds like Sound Garden kind of. The chorus is great)<BR>7. By Myself: 8/10 (Nice heavier song, with another cool chorus)<BR>8. In the End: 10/10 (Arguably the best song. Either way, it's one of my favorites)<BR>9. A Place For My Head: 9/10 (Very good rapping done here. It's very fast all the way through. Great song)<BR>10. Forgotten: 8/10 (Another heavier song with a catchy chorus)<BR>11. Cure For The Itch: 10/10 (Some say it's stupid... some say it's great. I think it's ingenious. DJ Mr. Hahn shows off his DJ/Mixing(etc) skills in this song. <BR>12. Pushing Me Away: 9/10 (Chester really shows off his voice in this song)<br />I'm a harcore Linkin Park fan, and I've heard them before they even realeased their album. They are original, unique and extremely talented. People, do not listen to the critics and buy this album if you like metal/nu-metal. You won't regret it.
B000065U1N|5.0|this movie was incredible!  it was a rough movie to watch.  with my brother being in Somolia at the time, i was finally able to see what he went through.  this movie is a hard-hitting, holds-nothing back kinda film.  be prepared for hard to watch scenes, particularlly one where surgery is preformed using bare hands (read: blood everywhere!!).  all in all, this movie is awesome.  totally worth the timw and money!!!
0380789035|5.0|American Gods by Neil Gaiman is a rollocking road trip through and American littered by Gods large and small that people have been bringing to America since they could get over on boat. Gaiman again takes material and mythologies that are familiar and but dated and brings them to the modern world.<br />This fun fast read that takes detours, back roads, and fast highways that mimic the American Road Trip experience.<br />It's a great book.
B000002KHY|4.0|Until I bought this and Volume 2, I had forgotten how timeless and diverse the songs by Sweet Baby James could be. Shows the influences of many different styles of music on this singer/songwriter.  This one warrants a long term space in my car's changer.
B000007NYS|5.0|She won the prestigious Grammy Album of the Year award for \\"Car Wheels On A Gravel Road\\", but I feel that this self-titled 1988 album is her finest! You've got wonderfull narrative songs like *The Night's Too Long* and *Crescent City*.  Then there's the playfull lament of the tex-mex *Big Red Sun Blues*, the folk-rock roll of *Passionate Kisses* (which is probably the highlight of the record}, and the raunchy *I Asked For Water*.  My favorite cut is the melancholy *Abandoned*, which has a beautifull electric guitar solo.  The book includes a quote from Lucinda's father making an analogy to how her music is so versatile, so uncategorizable. Lucinda can comfortably include material like the harmonica/electric guitar bluesy rock of *Changed The Locks* to the tender country balladry of *Am I Too Blue For You*. Yet, the album always maintains a tight focus, none of the songs sound out of place. Williams also included 6 bonus tracks, including acoustic blues covers like *Disgusted* and *Nothing In Rambling* as well as a beautifull folk ballad, *Sundays*. Lucinda can get very literal and detailed with her lyrics, which makes her songs all the more emotional and mysterious! The thing that struck me the most, though, was the raw, spontaneous, and inspired sound of Lucinda and her band. The musicianship and the production is very lively sounding. Like they just went into the studio, let the tapes roll, started playing, and wa la, you've got an album! The guitar hooks are edgy and catchy, and William's voice is pasionate and dynamic throughout all eighteen tracks. Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Patty Loveless all covered something from this album. If you discovered this talented lady through \\"Car Wheels\\", you'll love this record as well.<br />Thank you!
0385505833|4.0|I'm not an avid John Grisham reader, because his books usually partain to law and such, which is not of interest to me, but as an off-twist he spun a good one.  The book contains some good points about how materialistic our society has become especially around the Christmas season, however we partake in the madness every Christmas season any way.<br />This book was reviewed by many others as very humerous, and in comparison to some of John Grisham's other books it would pass as such I suppose, but I did not get many laughs out of it, certainly not as many as I was led on to receive.  Overall I would give it a 4, because it was an interesting and fast read that did manage to entertain me for most of the duration of the read.
B000065V1V|4.0|Remember when David Bowie debuted his Ziggy Stardust persona, freaking out straight-laced Americans and delighting teenaged girls everywhere who just loved seeing a skinny boy wearing makeup and dresses?  Do you remember Bowie's blistering chemical mix of glamour, smart raunch and spaced out rock, and how it turned the music industry on its ear?<br />I don't.  I was born in 1978, right around Bowie's \\"Low\\" and majestic \\"Heroes\\" album.  I didn't experience the eyeliner and stack shoes Bowie; being a child of the 80's and '90's, \\"Let's Dance\\" did it for me.  I grew to love Bowie from \\"Young Americans\\" and \\"Modern Love\\".  Later on, \\"Outside\\", and \\"Earthling\\" turned me on.  It was this ageless wonder, this strangely sexy man who could be charming in a silky, stylish, British way, and dirty and bass heavy at the same time.<br />It would not be hyperbole to call David Jones, aka David Bowie, aka Ziggy Stardust, aka the Thin White Duke, a master of disguise.  The man has worn many hats throughout his nearly forty decade career, and has rarely faltered: trippy starchild, blue (green?  One of each?) eyed soul crooner, rocked out sax man, fuzzy drum-and-bass king...they've all worked for him.  <br />So, where does a man go once he's not only traveled every road, but paved a few himself?<br />He backtracks, and he makes the old new again.  \\"Heathen\\" finds Bowie in a dark, reflective mood; this album seems to visit stops along the way of his cosmic journey, tying them together in a smooth, jarring, sweet and heavy way.  It works.<br />\\"Sunday\\" opens the album with its beeps and chirps, stuttering and pulsing like a souped-up Simon game.  Quietly menacing keyboards and guitars weave in and out of the melody, supporting Bowie's almost operatic vocals.  His drawn out, warbling notes remind me of why I fell in love with his voice.<br />The rest of the album is a lovely space oddity--Bowie's mix of horns, strings and electronic instruments is at once nostalgic and futuristic.  The '80's-ish title track marches along with a drum track and tinny keyboards.  \\"5:15 The Angels Have Gone\\" is one of my favorite tracks: the quiet, ethereal melody and the crisp drums create the perfect contrast between light and dark.  \\"Slow Burn\\", \\"Afraid\\" and \\"Slip Away\\" harken back to his early days, and with the Pixies remake of \\"Cactus\\", Bowie puts his own touch on the track, making it sound less like a remake than his own creation.<br />Rarely does this album disappoint, as some of its early predecessors have; instead of trying too hard to sound trendy, Bowie takes all he's learned over the years and offers a sublimely connected album.  This is neo-classic Bowie.
0783114893|2.0|I bought this on a whim, having heard good things about it.<br />It starts off well with Rutger Hauer suitably understated and menacing. However, by the first half hour the movie gets lost in la-la land with &quot;The Hitcher&quot; apparently having the killing and survival power of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator.<br />On top of the body count he racks up while hitching on the freeway, he also manages to take out a bunch of cops at a backwater police station (all killed apparently in total silence while our hero is taking a nap in one of the cells).<br />At this point, it took all of my energy not to switch the movie off in disgust. It's too ridiculous to be thrilling. This sort of thing has been done so much better in numerous other films. Steven Spielberg's Duel being one example. Even Breakdown with Kurt Russell was more convincing than this.<br />Despite the occasional effective moment, my advice would be to give this one a big miss ...
B00005JKMQ|4.0|The movie Ali was not the best but it was good enough. The sound effects were good, the vision was good, and about everything else was good. But I wouldn't spend [the money] buying this movie.
0345448898|5.0|I attend Narbonne High School.  I often ask the Librarian if has any suggestions as to what to read.  She suggested The Golden Compass.  This has been one of the best books I have read.  I like fantasy and this fits it to a T.  I felt that I could connect with the characters in the book.  For those who do not know, the book is about a girl who receives and interesting compass.  The compass is unlike any we have in our world.  Lyra is the main character.  She is a smart young girl who lives in Oxford at Jordan College.<br />     In Lyra's world it is unheard of for people to not have deamons.  Pantalaimon is Lyra's deamon.  He acts as her conscience.  They are a perfect pair.  There are many other fascinating characters, such as Mrs. Coulter, an aeronaut Lee Scoresby, \\"uncle\\" Asriel, witch queen Serafina Pekkala, Iorek Byrnison the armored bear. It is fascinating to see how all of these characters are intertwined to make such a marvelous book.<br />     Philip Pullman has really outdone himself.  As soon as I finished the first book I couldn't wait to get my hands on the second one and the third one.  His Dark Materials is set up like Lord of the Rings.  It's a story that is about one huge adventure mad into different books.  I recommend the series to all of my friends.  The way the story id written leaves me wanting more.  It was very hard to put the book down.  I would strongly suggest that for anyone who is intending on reading these books to make sure you have enough time.  Once I got reading I couldn't stop.  Pullman has really outdone himself.<br />     His Dark Materials should be in every library.  No library is complete with out it.  The Golden Compass is food to everyone's imagination.  The characters feel so real that it is hard not to believe it is truth.  After I read the first one I wished that I was in Lyra's world and had a deamon.  The friends that I have recommended the series to go on to read other books written my Pullman.  The Golden Compass is afascinating story that leads to suspense, action, adventure and drama.  I would give this book a ten!
B00000G09Q|3.0|This movie might not have added up to TMNT 1&2, but it is good in it's own way. True, Casey Jones had a very minor role, it didn't take place in New York, the idea of going back in time seemed a bit weird, Kevin Clash did not return to do Splinter, the acting seemed a bit childish at times, and it was not as dark as the first two movies. However, being a long time fan of Ninja Turtles, I can somewhat overlook those flaws. The humor was a little cheezy but in a funny sort of way. One definate plus to TMNT 3 is that the turtles used their weapons more than they did in the TMNT 2. Also, \\"Turtles in Time\\" takes a break from the original plot and makes for a new adventure. A year ago, my review of this movie was somewhat negative due to being 5 years since I watched it last. Seven people gave feedback toward my previous review and found it helpful. I appreciate those feedbacks but I recently watched TMNT 3 again and have come to like the movie for what it is. Though \\"Turtles in Time\\" should not have been an end to the series, the movie is still entertaining to watch in my opinion. As for the DVD version, the features aren't very impressive. If you still own the VHS version, don't bother replacing it with the DVD unless your VHS copy has worn out over the years. Apparently a 4th TMNT movie is coming out in early 2004. I don't know whether it will be animated or live action but that should give Ninja Turtle fans something to look foward to next year. Hopefully, the 4th movie will be geared more towards teens as well as adults unlike the previous sequels which were mainly for die-hard Ninja Turtle fans only.
B00000IQC8|5.0|As the crude, yet honest Randall states in this flick, \\"You'll feel a lot better if you just rip into the occasional customer.\\"  This hilarious, low-budget, well-written comedy seems to be an excercise in venting frustration relatable to anyone who's ever served the public.  Equally as important in this movie are the ugly relationship themes of jealousy and infidelity, which Kevin Smith manages to portray so nakedly honest and familiar that one can't help but laugh ...Despite moments in which the mouthfulls of intelligent dialogue seem too much for the actors to deliver, the black-and-white photography gives the viewer the feeling of watching a day's worth of surveillance footage at a local convenience store... which just so happens to be the funniest day to ever transpire there.
B00005MP58|5.0|Superbly casted and acted, this is the best adaptation of Jane Austen's novel that I have ever seen.  Faithful to the novel in most respects.  The scenes are just how I pictured them while reading the book over and over again.  A few minor scenes have been added which were not in the book but they fit right in.  My teenage daughter has declared Mr. Darcy to be &quot;hot.&quot;  Need I say more?!
0780619609|4.0|Secret of the Ooze is a good sequel to the first film. The Shredder takes the cake as one of the best villans ever, the story was good, and so was the music to the film. Minus a 5th star for Casey Jones not returning and for the running time being 10 minutes less than the first TMNT. Despite these minor flaws, TMNT 2 still ranks up with the first movie for the most part. I watched the making of \\"secret of the ooze\\" and I think it should have been included on the DVD with a good number of other features. Jim Henson put alot of work in helping to create the live-action characters in this movie. Plus, this was the last movie that Jim Henson helped work on before his death and I think the DVD version of TMNT 2 should have recognize the work that he put into it.
B000066NW0|5.0|...Anyway this album is POWERFUL very POWERFUL. This chick can jam. The touch of punk with a killer bass line. Do I need to say any more. Buy it!
B000002TPS|5.0|For a long time now, I've been trying to figure out which Megadeth album is the best.  This was my first album of theirs, and I loved it.  I've since bought all but three of them (&quot;Killing is my Business..&quot;, &quot;So Far..&quot;, and &quot;Risk&quot;), and now I believe I've come to the conclusion that this is Megadeth's greatest achievement.<br />It's been said of this album that Megadeth &quot;sold out&quot; here simply because it's more melodic than previous releases.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Megadeth have not sold out, they have branched out.  They have managed to maintain their heaviness and technicality, while adding more variety and melody to the repertoire, something their contemporaries, Metallica, never successfully did.<br />This album is nothing short of top-notch melodic metal, and every song is a classic.  &quot;A Tout Le Monde&quot; is an awesome ballad, &quot;Family Tree&quot; has a great combination of heavy riffs and Maiden-like melody, and &quot;Black Curtains&quot; and &quot;Train of Consequences&quot; just flat out rock hard.  And who could forget &quot;Victory&quot;?  Definitely their best song to date.  Great guitarwork here, with very nice Maiden harmonics and a solo that will blow you away.  Clever lyrics too, incorporating the titles of older songs (although the &quot;Lucretia said&quot; one really just sounds like they were squeezing in one more). Great ending to a great album.<br />Despite what anyone says about this album, or about &quot;Peace Sells&quot; or &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, I personally feel that Megadeth hit their peak with this album right here.  If you like heavy music with plentiful melody, this one is a must.  Let's hope Dave one day returns.  He had a gift that should not go to waste.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Most professional reviewers panned this movie - which is a sure sign that it's decent and clean and your grandmother and kids can watch it. If you like action, blood, cleavage, nudity and sexual situations and inuendos and that epitome of intelligent artistic expression in screen dialogue, the F- word,  - then this movie is definitely NOT for you. It is a sweet story of boy and girl next door love and patriotism. I've heard it described as overly cliche, if that's the case then bring on more! I don't care for Jim Carrey's wild/crazy personna and avoid those films, but I love him in The Majestic and The Truman Show. Like Robin Williams, he shows that his talents run the whole spectrum and I can't wait to see more of his serious side. However he is a comic genious and it would be a shame if he totally abandoned something he is so good at.
0792844890|5.0|I have seen all of the Mel Brooks spoofs except for Blazing Sattles but I have to say that Spaceballs is one of the best spoofs around!  The acting was great, the lines were very funny, and this movie definately needs a sequel.However, if you aren't a fan of Star Wars then you might not like this movie very much.
B00003CXXP|1.0|It should have ended approximately one hour sooner than it did.  The story just dragged on and on, it was really painful.
0812550706|5.0|I have to say that i'm not much of a sci-fi reader and when I was recommended this book, i was skeptical. However, when i started reading this, i was immediately drawn in because to me, the whole fighting aliens is the basic storyline that holds everything together but definitely not the most important thing of the story. I was fascinated by the way the author wrote Ender's feelings and thoughts and really delved into the psyche of the boy. This story is amazing and though i've read it a dozen times, i keep coming back to it. Orson Scott Card is an extremely gifted and funny writer and Ender's Game has become one of my favorite books because of it. Other amazing works of his are Enchantment (though it's not very sci-fi at all) and Ender's Shadow which is a parallel story to Ender's Game but from the viewpoint of Bean. The juxtaposition of the two is very well done. All in all, this book is exciting, gripping, and wonderful. Definitely worth buying because chances are, it will most likely be checked out of your library or you'll get sick of going back to borrow the same book over and over again.
B000066NW0|5.0|Dude kids, this CD kids buttox, and if you don't get it I will be angered. Its a total blend of mad rock in &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot; and cute punky songs like &quot;Sk8r Boi&quot; then ballads that are kinda countryish with that rock twist like the song &quot;I'm with you&quot;.  What got me going on this punksta was the song &quot;Complicated&quot;. I was leaving school, driving my car when the song came on and I was like &quot;hey, I dig this!&quot; then the line &quot;Take off all your preppy clothes&quot; totally got me cause then I knew... she was a punksta. Next time the song came on I freaked out and totally listend to the lyrics. Kids, the song is about being yourself and not being what people in the situation your in want you to be, cause someone will catch you and think you look  like a foo, and write a song about it and get famous off of it and you don't want dat do ya? nu-uh
B000059PR5|4.0|Some films manage to catch the zeitgeist of a certain period in time so well, their very name becomes synonymous with the events and feelings of that time.  The Day After is one of those films.  Created at the height of Reagan-era nuclear posturing, the time in which the world was pushed as close to nuclear war as we were during the Cuban Missile Crisis (the Doomsday Clock was at one minute to midnight, for those that remember), TDA details the events leading up to and directly after a massive nuclear exchange between the US and the USSR.  The story sticks to one family of dirtfarmers in Missouri, an outcropping of students as the University of Kansas, an Air Force soldier who helped push the trigger, and a student who chose the wrong time to try and go home and see his parents.<br />The reasons for the nuclear exchange are never explored, and it doesnt matter: at the time this movie was made, everyone was aware of the reality of total annihilation every time the Teflon Cowboy in the White House shot off at the mouth.  The few days after the war show the debilitating, eroding effects of radiation, and although it was extremely visceral for a television movie, the actual effects would be much worse (see Threads).  Civil structure breaks down, creating a might-makes-right world where those with the guns create the rules  scary, considering who owns most of the guns in the USA right now.<br />Some compare this movie to Threads and Testament and say those are better.  Dont.  The comparison isnt fair.  Threads explores the breakdown of social structure.  Testament explores the breakdown of community and family.  TDA explores the breakdown of the individual person.  They are three totally different films, each effective in their own way of showing the awful effects of nuclear war.  Although it seems that our leaders have finally wised up about the whole kill each other a dozen times over thing, I wouldnt put it past some bozo to finally push the button one day, making TDA and other films of its kind just as important today as they were in the early 80s.  True, its not a great film  the acting is wooden in places and the special effects are pretty laughable, even for that time  but it is almost a snapshot of the horror many of us faced during the early 80s.<br />This VHS, from the magical elves at Anchor Bay, is a fully-restored, video-length (longer than the original TV release) version of the movie.  According to the PR elves at Anchor Bay, a DVD release should happen in the next year or so  and heres hoping.  Until then, this budget tape will more than tide you over.<br />Final Grade: B+t put it past some bozo to finally push the button one day, making TDA and other films of its kind just as important today as they were in the early 80s.

B000002GB6|5.0|I didn't think it was possible for a man and a peruvian blowhorn to pipe out such a magical web of life that would root itself in the lives of those whom it touched and elevate them to some higher ground.  Not even a chicken hash sandwich with sausage gravy could tear me away from this album.  There it sits on the turntable -- when Mark brings the kegs in, where's Chuck?  Chuck's making us Feel Good, of course.  When Mark hauls the Fresh Loaf out of the oven, where's Chuck?  Spinning us Feel Good magic on the turntable.  I don't know much, but I know when its time for a lil' He-Bear Guzowski.
B00001YXH6|5.0|After I saw this performed live that is exactly what I thought!  Quidam will keep you at the edge of your seat, craving for more amazing acts.  I was sad to get up when the intermission came and even sadder when it ended.  The music was absolutely perfect for the performance and the acts were really breath-taking.  I would suggest seeing Quidam live before the movie but both are exellent.
B00006690G|5.0|The first time I saw Eminem was on TRL with \\"The Way I Am\\" when the Marshall Mathers LP came out. Don't ask me why I didn't buy the cd then especially after hearing \\"Stan\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shaddy.\\" But I knew he'd be back! Two years later I'm watching MTV and there is Em's new video \\"Without Me\\" I decided right then that I have to go get The Eminem Show, and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. I am so glad I did I would've been so mad if I knew what I was missing, and after hearing this cd, which everyone should have whether they like Eminem or not, I bought the Marshall Mathers LP. He is truely talented, and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.
B000065V1V|4.0|Heathen is beautiful and amazing. It's great to see that Bowie has stopped trying so hard to reinvent himself yet again. This album is refreshingly devoid of pretense, and the songwriting and arrangements are inspired. A couple of misses, but then every great album has its flaws. <BR>This is the real thing, people.<BR>Old fans -- this is what you've been waiting for.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that my viewing of this mini-series started me on my Colin Firth obsession. But in anycase, this is a great movie, and beware, you may end-up watching all 6 episoded in one sitting!
014028009X|5.0|the brigdet jones's diary is so funny! It's really entertaining and Brigdet is such a mess. Every woman will identify with her at some point of her life (love life, cooking, work...). You will laugh out loud while reading her opinions on men,life, money,etc.,(based on every self-help book she has ever read), or about her family, and her mother's &quot;affair&quot;.<BR>I recommend it to every woman on earth, married, single, divorcee... But what's most amazing is that vol.2 is even better &amp; a lot funnier! READ'EM

0767811070|5.0|Boyz N the Hood was and still is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen. Shot entirely in South Central LA to present the movie as realistic as possible. The movie debuted in theater back in 1991 and had an immediate impact on almost everyone who viewed it.<br />The story about 3 friends growing up in the hood in South Central LA. Each one with their own individual struggle and goals in life. Doughboy (Ice Cube) ,who is a drug dealer, has been in and out of trouble throughout his young life and seems to be happy with his surroundings. Doughboy's brother Ricky (Morris Chestnut) a teenage father with bright hopes and aspirations of becoming an NFL football player ; and Ricky's best friend Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who hopes and dreams of higher education and an escape from the dwelling of the hood. \\"The Hood\\" where saying the wrong thing or looking at someone the wrong way can end in death. Tre's father (Larry Fishburne) is a responsible, educated and strict father who makes sure his son stays on the right track in achieving his goals in life. Teaching him about responsibility and keeping your cool in adverse situations in order to make a thoughtful descision. Tre's resolve will be tested when tragedy strikes close to home and revenge and murder seem like the only solution.<br />Fantastic direction by John Singleton and equally impressive acting by all characters are the reason Boyz N the Hood was such a huge success. It was nominated for two acedemy awards (Direction and Screenplay.) ... You have to see this one for yourself you won't be sorry.
B00003CXQY|4.0|The Emperor's New Grove was a little of a refreshing change from the typical fairytale adventures of fictional animals or people. It had the 90's sense of humor. <br />Mainly because of the quick wit and energy of the talents of David Spade. I have to believ a lot of what he did - or rather the way he did it - was improvisational. He had to have made it up. John goodman is good as the innocent bistander and who could forget Ertha Kkitt as the evil temptress. Konk is very funny too.<br />The story is simple, the action is funny and the situations are amazing. (Tittle song by Tom Jones himself!)<br />The DVD Extras on this film are wonderful. The behind the scens of storyboarding and record the voices and music are great. Even Sting is on this one.<br />The technical aspect of putting this together must have been a challange. There is even a game for the kids to play (and me too).<br />Overall this DVD is pretty good and because it is the collectors edition - the extras are worth it alone.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan's Cd is one of the best new cd's i have ever bought. They are so great at harmonizing and their lyrics have something in them that everyone can relate to. I recommend &quot;worst day ever&quot;. and if you get a chance to see them live.. DO IT! They are so enerjetic and really interact with the crowd. So do yourself a favor and buy the cd and see them live!!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|As you may have guessed, Donkey is my favorite character!<br />The movie starts out with Shrek's (a nasty green Ogre) property getting invaded by townspeople with pitchforks and torches ready to bring Shrek in for a nice reward.  Lord Farquaad is handing out rewards to anyone who turns in a fairytale creature (i.e., the 7 dwarfs, the 3 bears, witches, talking donkeys...).  Donkey won't talk for the kingsmen, so ends up getting away, until his former owner knocks over a fairy in a cage and donkey can fly.  Only then does he start talking and the fairy dust wears off and he comes falling from the sky.  The kingsmen run after him, and Donkey hides behind Shrek.<br />After Donkey annoys the hell out of Shrek enough, Shrek lets Donkey stay at his house overnight, outside.  While in the middle of dinner, Shrek has some uninvited guests, all of the fairy tale creatures.  He and Donkey set off to find Lord Farquaad and get them all off of his land.<br />Well, that's a good starter, anyways.  And like I said, if anybody knows where I can get one of those Eddie Murphy Donkies I would appreciate it!!
B00005JKCF|5.0|Toby McQuire is Dynamic a Peter Parker. Kurstin Dunst is totally believable as his girlfriend Jane! Need I say more!<br />Sam Rami did an exciting job with the technical and emotional \\"strings\\" of this film. He through in action, adventure, special effects and some great stunts in the origins of Peter Parker (aka SPIDERMAN). It has a great story - nothing new or innovative, but definately believable.<br />Even William Dafoe looked like he had a great time as the villian and above all that the love story was wonderful and refreshing. (Granted certain scenes ay have been a luittle too long - but it didn't deter from the overall film itself.)<br />This movie is fun for the whole family and the Peter Parker \\"narative\\" that opens and closes the movies makes your feel like the next \\"Comic Book\\" (movie - sequal) will be out soon.<br />Lets just say, when Spidey swings into action, the movie shoots in high gear. Go see it!
B000066NW0|3.0|I think Avril is an excellent singer with major-league vocal ability, and most of the songs are catchy and decent.  The problem is that although Avril's image is &quot;punk,&quot; her music is far from it.  Only &quot;Sk8r Boi&quot; even remotely resembles this genre (and VERY remotely).  Make no mistake, this is pop music.  some impressive vocals though.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I must say, when I saw this in the theatre I would have reviewd this with two stars at best. It didn't work for me on the big screen.<br />So I got the DVD to give it a second chance. And guess what? It works better on the small screen for me.<br />The magic and story came alive for me and I really got a chance to look closer at the story and performances. Maggie Smith is one of my favorites and the kids are really good.<br />The DVD extras on this one are the best. Take it to your computer or just explore on your own TV. The rooms and behind the scenes are very well done. There's a game and even a guided tour on this one.<br />I also liked the fact they talked about the sequel coming next year. (Kenneth Branagh will be in it!) Overall this is a good made-for-tv-type film and works very well for home viewing. Give it a shot and ride your broom!
B000002BBY|5.0|Wow, where do i begin??? This Album, is nothing but the best. The ONLY album i can listen to the whole way through and not wanna skip a track. Hello is brillaint, roll with it is rockin. Wonderwall is so crisp and perfect its sick. Dont look back in anger is there best song ever. Hey now is underrated classic. Some might say gets your blood flowing, while Cast no shadow shows how excellent the gallaghers can sing together. Shes electric softens the mood and Morning glory gets you pumped. With the best closing track of Champagne Supernova, Whats the story is the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be...

She sings about real stuff, not fairtail love stories and that swart of stuff. its a great cd and id recomend it for ne1
B0000640VO|5.0|I hate \\"chick-flicks\\"; hate them with a passion!  I was more or less dragged to see this French movie, and I am so glad I was forced to see it.  This is the farthest thing from a typical \\"chick-flick\\".  For example, it's absolutely hilarious and it never takes itself too seriously.  The story's hand kind of ambles along; not too fast, not too slow.  The editorial describes this film as \\"pragmatic.\\"  I would say that this is term is accurate.  The film is driven by it's cause-and-effect nature, and as you will see, absolutely nothing happens in this film without causing something down the line.  As a result, everything builds to a crescendo.  The humor gets funnier, and the story becomes more enrapturing.<br />If you are a young guy like me (26), I know you will at least be able to tolerate this movie.  As a matter of fact I'm betting you'll actually like it!  I don't think anyone can see this film and not be in a good mood afterward.  I would definitely classify this as a date movie.  Even if you don't have a date, get this film and lose yourself in Amelie's beautiful world.
079283318X|4.0|What distinguishes GoldenEye from its 007 predecessors is the high-octane action sequences.  Sure, James Bond movies tend to have sky-high budgets and high-tech gizmos to play with, not to mentioned a pop-culture icon as its main character, but GoldenEye's fiery action sequences nearly rival the best of John Woo's, even on the small screen.  Director Martin Campbell knows his action, and everything from the gunfights to the vehicle stunts is superbly done.  In fact, the only problem is that at times there's almost too much of it.  As flawless the execution is, it leaves one with no sense of contrast, and the film seems to pay only cursory attention to the quieter, character-building scenes.<br />No matter.  Pierce Brosnan does quite well as the latest Bond, making up with boyish charm what he (completely) lacks in high-class suave.  Famke Janssen falls flat on her face as prototypical bad Bond girl Xenia.  The best of the  Bond vixens, from Ursula Andress to Grace Jones, create a love/hate chemistry with 007, straddling the line between sexy seductiveness and dangerous betrayal.  In Janssen's case, all she gets across is an annoying, over-the-top pretense towards S&amp;M perversity, neither sexy nor threatening, just deeply offensive, stinking up the screentime.  Thank God then we have Izabella Scorupco as Russian computer programmer Natalya, who is possibly the best in a laudable line of smarter, more active Bond love interests, besting even Carey Lowell (License to Kill) and Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies).  Sean Bean makes a good adversary with his controlled, subtle villainy, refraining from the campy overkill that had made Jonathan Pryce so unbearable in Tomorrow Never Dies.<br />The plot gets tangled sometimes and there's some clumsiness in bringing the various plot strands together (the GoldenEye main plot and Bond's tracking of Xenia's organization, for example, are wound together in an awkward way), but since this is a Bond movie, those are probably secondary concerns.  One last gripe, I will say, is that GoldenEye has one of the worst theme songs in the series, Tina Turner's performance flat and uninspired.  Still, great adrenalized entertainment, signalling a new beginning to this unkillable film dynasty.
B000002NJS|5.0|Before buying 'Ray Of Light', I only owned one Madonna CD, 'The Immaculate Collection', which featured most of her hit singles from the 1980's.  I liked her brand of Top 40 music and her voice always had an attractive quality to me, but never thought of buying a full album of music because I always thought her best songs were the hit singles.  Then the 'Ray Of Light' album was released and I heard the song 'The Power Of Good-Bye', and I was very suprised by how moved I was by it.  The music seemed so deep, emotional and well-written--not what I had expected from the Material Girl.  I went out immediately and bought the album and was not disappointed--in fact, it was even better than I had hoped for.<br />Much of the music on 'Ray Of Light' is dark, introspective, but hauntingly beautiful, especially Madonna's vocal melodies.  There is great use of Electronica on many of the songs, but it is never distracting or intrusive--it only adds to the atmosphere.  The lyrics are filled with vivid imagery and fit the songs perfectly, even though I had a hard time trying to comprehend the full meaning behind them.  If I had to pick a couple of favorite songs, they would be 'Swim', 'Nothing Really Matters, 'Frozen', 'The Power Of Good-Bye' and 'Little Star'.<br />This album went a long way to breaking some of my preconceived notions about Madonna's music and her standing as an artist.  A very solid collection of heartfelt songs that will definitely stand the test of time.  This is the album that Madonna's really matures on, and we are fortunate to be able to listen to it.
B00005OAIE|3.0|John Mayer's cd is rather base.  The lyrics are undaunting and ordinary.  Sometimes they are downright corny.  Nevertheless I appreciate his music writing skills and his voice is unique.  Buy it for your car - - where you're too distracted by other things to pay attention to the words.
B00004X01U|1.0|The \\"herd mentality\\" of the human race (especially the American music-buyer) never ceases to amaze me. I find it very difficult to believe the number of people who bought this CD and actually like it. (Of course, I think the truth of the matter is that Madonna KNOWS she has established such a strong fan base, that \\"whatever\\" she happens to put out will still go multi-platinum because her fan base is made up of mindless lambs who will flock to the record stores, no matter what [garbage] she releases.) There is no way this CD can be considered excellent, good--or even mediocre. If this CD had been released by anyone else in the music industry, it would have never even broke the Top 100. Yes, it looks like Madonna's fans have been afflicted with the same disease as Mariah's fans--they will buy anything and everything she records--no matter how good or bad it is. <br />People, people.... There is so much REAL music out there--most of which never even approaches the Top 100 or Top 40. It is a shame that good quality music continually gets overshadowed by the mindless mentality of the \\"human herd\\" who rely on their radio to define what is \\"good music\\".  I truly believe that Madonna could record the blandest version of \\"Three Blind Mice\\", and her fan base would make it a #1 hit. Wake up, people. There IS good music out there, if you would only take the time and initiative to find it.<br />One reviewer wrote if this album was as bad as people claim it to be, Madonna would never have released it, since she has millions.  Are you for real?  I think Madonna has gone way beyond the point of having to do ANYTHING (singing, touring, acting, etc.) for money.  Madonna released this CD (whose only listenable song is \\"Music\\") as an attempt to remain mainstream.  <br />Do any of her fans ever wonder why Madonna continually hop-scotches from producer to producer with each new CD?  It is simple: she hears the \\"sound du joir\\", usually on European radio, and then hires the \\"producer du jour\\" to produce her CD.  Hence, her sound always sounds \\"mainstream\\" because of the PRODUCERS--not because of anything SHE has done.  As for her songwriting, another question: Why do each of her songs list 5-7 writers--and oh, by the way, one of the writers always happens to be \\"Madonna\\"?  <br />Wouldn't the TRUE test of Madonna's \\"genius\\" be if she were to write and produce every song on just ONE of her CDs?  When Madonna finally does that, THEN maybe I will be impressed with her.  Until then, let's all acknowledge reality: Madonna's true genius lies in her ability to MARKET herself--and not in her ability to \\"create\\" music.

6300214028|4.0|Beatty's historical-biographical epic about John Reed deserves credit for tackling the controversial subject of Communist sympathizers in America during the early part of the 20th century. Reed is sympathetically portrayed as a sincere idealist who sees those ideals betrayed in the aftermath of the Russian revolution, long before the Cold War got started. Subsequently revealed facts may have modified this view of Reed, but the drama is still effective if taken on it's own terms.<br />Some reviewers felt the romantic subplot was unnecessary or overemphasized, but I think it serves to show Reed as an uncompromising idealist even in his personal life. He questions all social institutions, even marriage, in trying to maintain an open relationship with his main romantic interest. The vicissitudes of their relationship are a tellng illustration of  the difficulties on the personal level they have in adapting to the bold social revisions they are endorsing. The fact that Louise later voluntarily endures personal hardship to find him and care for him indicates a final personal triumph, underscoring the disappointment he has in the turn of larger scale events which ultimately hasten his demise.  <br />Although the real-life Communist drama has ended in a way that Reed, and even Beatty in 1981, certainly didn't imagine, there is still relevance to modern audiences. Current events are foreshadowed in the scene where Reed makes a speech to an Arab crowd that attempts to parallel Eastern and Western class struggles, and they begin chanting for Jihad against America and it's allies. Although Reed complains about translation problems to his Russian sponsors, it is remarkable how little it took to agitate a crowd of Arab men into a violent anti-Western rage, even back then.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down will go down as one of the must see war films on a short list of movies.  Platoon and Saving Private Ryan are the other two.  Black Hawk Down has no stupid cheesey, macho Hollywood lines or unrealistic, stylish fight sequences or unnecessary, out of place love stories (please take note the directors of Episode II and Pearl Harbor) which destroy the credibility of the movie.  It's about an ugly, ill-fated war that the US raged.  What separates this movie is it truly captures the chaotic, terryfing nature of war.  The combatants look genuinely scared and confused in this movie.  The movie shows the terrible toll it takes on our young men.  There are body parts littered all over as well as brocken hearts of young men who know of their demise.  Bullets and bombs don't distinguish between Night Stalkers, Rangers, or Delta operatives.  Yet amidst this savagery we see the very best in human nature.  One example among many being the actions of the two Delta Snipers who single handedly fought off the Solmalis is a true illustration of heroism.  After watching the sacrifice of those two warriors, I have had a hard time listening to the media cheapening the value of the word hero on some undeserving individuals.  After watching this movie, I have more respect than ever before for the members of our special forces.  I learned that equipment should never be withheld from soldiers due to political reasons.  I wonder how many lives could have been spared had APCs and AC-130s been supplied.  Politicians should stick to politics and soldiers should do the fighting.  Isn't it ironic that these real event are more riveting than anything that Hollywood could have written?
B0000542D2|5.0|Here's the band that started it all having the time of their life.  Roger Ebert recently rated this film as one of his all time musicals and you will too.  <br />I envy you if you have never seen \\"A Hard Days Night\\".  That's right, I envy you, because after you watch this film for the first time you will be hooked...Repeat after me...\\"A Hard Days Night\\" is the greatest music film of all time.  <br />When the Beatles made \\"A Hard Days Night\\", they were fresh off their America success, but the crushing world wide fame was still a few months away.  The Beatles were still wide-eyed innocent youths who were poking fun at the whole show business world.  This film was shot in early 1964 and released later that year.  David Crosby quotes the film as inspiring him and other members of the Birds into forming a rock band.<br />Neat bits to look for in the film.  The cute blonde on the train (Patty Boyd) would become George Harrison's first wife and Eric Clapton's later wife.  Look for Phil Collins as a ten year old fan in the tv concert scene.  John has a bit of fun reading his own book of poetry and making a reference to his favorite soft drink.<br />This film takes you on a wild ride inside the all too brief world of Beatlemania.  It's great to have a film that I can share with my kids that's still as fresh and as fun as the day it premiered.  Enjoy...

B00003CXI1|3.0|I saw &quot;Harry Potter&quot; the first day it was out. Yes, I thought it was good, mm-hmm, everything was good, yadda yadda...<BR>  That is, until I saw Lord of the Rings. (LOTR)<BR>With the fantastic job that Peter Jackson did on LOTR, I began to realize just how disappointed I was with Harry Potter. I thought there were lovely little touches and some good acting in HP, but the scene with Quirrel and Voldemort, the climax, was slightly disapointing. Wasn't  Quirrel supposed to be burning, and not crumbling? Yeah, I know; &quot;the burning would scare the little kids.&quot; I would know as well as anybody: after all, I have a friend in second grade who would be scared by it. But still... Well, that wasn't the main problem ( I s'pose I'm just complaining). The troll DID NOT FIT. He was just a bit too unreaistic (but, hey, I guess that would be too scary for the little kids too! But don't get me wrong: I woulda been scared by somethin' like that if I was little.) Well it's OK: entertaining, but not entralling.

B00005YW4H|3.0|I really wanted to love this CD.  I first heard the opening notes of \\"Don't Know Why\\" on VH1, and had to stop flipping channels to see why that channel was playing what I could only call Jazz.  It's a great song, and her performance of it was so refreshing that I couldn't stop humming it.<BR>So I went to [her website] and downloaded the MP3s from her House of Blues performance, and I was blown away.  She has some maturing to do, no doubt, but these live tracks (in particular, Bessie Smith) show a real talent.<BR>So why does the CD have relatively little of her great piano work?  And how was it possible to suck most of the life out of this great live performer?<BR>There are some great tunes on this CD - but mostly I'm disappointed that the energy & talent on display in those MP3s is missing from this release.

B000065U1N|5.0|I orignally watched &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; at the theaters after reading the book and watching the documentary on CNN, but &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; is even better on DVD and I'll tell you why:  (1.  Subtitles.  Many things occur in &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; and Director Ridley Scott has the complex task of breaking down an almost one day old fire fight involving hundreds of lives into a two hour film.  One complaint about this film is the fact that it is hard to keep track of who the main characters are.  The subtitles help.  (2.  The story behind the making of &quot;Blackhawk Down.&quot;  The story on the DVD about the making of &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; was about as good as watching the movie itself because it explained the whole story plus the main characters in great detail including all the work that went into the making of the film which for me, anyway, enriched the whole film much more.  For example, I did not know that the Defense Dept. not only provided the blackhawk helicoptors for the movie, but also the personnel to actually do the stunts.  I also did not know that the actors involved actually went to a shortened bootcamp at Fort Benning, Ga. to recreate the training of the Rangers, and that the Delta operators went to Fort Bragg, North Carolina and learned how to make bombs and such like the Delta Team Operators do.  That was very interesting.  I also did not know that the actor who played Mike Durant, the captured helicoptor pilot, got to meet the real Mike Durant and that he was very touched by that experience.  That richened my appreciation of the film.  The sound on the DVD was excellent as well and having the ability to replay certain scenes over and over allowed me to comprehend what was going on in the film.  All in all, &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; was and is a great film and by watching it on DVD and taking advantage of the subtitles option as well as watching how &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; was made, a viewer can get to really understand and appreciate the movie even more.and appreciate the movie even more.
B00003CXI1|4.0|OK, so a million other people have written reviews for this, so why one more?  Why not.<br />I loved the film itself when it came out in 2001 and I was looking forward to getting it on DVD because of the extra features.  Unfortunately, there is no commentary track, which is what I was hoping for, so that's one point off.<br />The good news is that they've included six deleted scenes and one extended version of an existing scene.<br />The bad news is that you need to perform a convoluted procedure to get to them.  Here's how to do it.<br />1/ Put in the second disc (the &quot;extras&quot;)<br />2/ Select &quot;Diagon Alley&quot;<br />3/ To enter the alley, you either choose 4 incorrect bricks (at which point the DVD gives in and lets you enter), or you choose, in the correct order, 5 bricks out of perhaps a dozen or so.<br />4/ You then select the *key* on the Gringott's sign.  This takes you to a Gringott's screen.<br />5/ Then you select the coins.  Are we getting close yet?  Nope.<br />6/ You return to Diagon Alley, and select Olivander's.  You have to pick 3 wands, because the first two you choose are always going to be explosive.  Now that you've got your wand, you return to the main menu.<br />7/ At this point, in the main menu, you can pick the &quot;classroom&quot; (the image of the wand below the white owl).  If you didn't go through the first 6 steps, it won't let you in.<br />8/ Now move the highlight to the cat (&quot;Transfigurations&quot;) and push the down arrow.  The two owls on the pedestal should highlight.  Push enter.<br />9/ Now the two owls AND the H on the pedestal should be highlighted.  Push enter again.<br />10/ Are we there yet?  Nope.  Now you have to &quot;get past fluffly&quot;.  Choose the flute.<br />11/ Now you have to select the correct key.  It's the tiny one in the exact centre of the screen.  If you're not sure which one it is, watch the middle of the screen carefully before the animation stops.  One of the keys won't be flappingproperly -- it's got a broken wing, you see.<br />12/ Almost there.  Now you have to choose the correct potion.  It's the round golden one.<br />13/ Finally, you're at the mirror of Erised.  Move the highlight to the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's stone in the middle of the mirror and you'll be presented with a screen that lets you choose from three of the deleted scenes.  Be sure to use the forward arrow on that screen to see an additional four scenes.<br />Extremely annoying to get to, but worth it in the end.
B000063UR2|4.0|I saw Legend when I was 14 years old, and to say it stuck in my mind would be an understatement. Over the years I heard stories about the different cuts of the film, the different scores, etc., and now we finally have a chance to compare the different versions. The film tells the tale of Darkness' plot to kill the last two Unicorns and plunge the world into an eternal night. <br />    The discs come packaged in a clear case, with a very attractive 2-layer cover featuring Darkness on the inside, Jack and Lilly on the outside; The 2 images fit together to make one picture. Very cool looking! Disc one has the Director's Cut, with commentary by Ridley Scott. This cut is longer than the U.S. release, and features an orchestral score by Jerry Goldsmith. (I'm a HUGE Goldsmith fan, but I found the score to be overwrought, and it didn't seem to even fit the film, let alone enhance the viewing experience. I bought the CD, so I will be giving Jerry another chance to impress me. It just didn't seem to work for the film.) I found the Director's Cut to be overlong, and there were times when I really had to fight to stay awake. (I lost that fight a few times....it was really boring.) Most noteable among the differences in the two versions is the fact that Darkness isn't shown for almost an hour-and-a-half. we see his hands, and shadowy glimpses here and there, but that's it. Scott's commentary is very insightful, and provides a lot of answers to questions that have been nagging at my mind, like why does Blix look like Keith Richards?<br />   Disc two has the U.S. release (No commentary!), with the Tangerine Dream synth score, which I like much better. This version of the film moves quicker, and seems to have more of a sense of urgency about it. (The score is PHENOMENAL, and really adds a sense of menace to the film.)It's still a deeply flawed film, but this is the better version, in my opinion. This disc also has 3 storyboard sequences, the isolated Tangerine Dream score, an hour-long making-of feature, cast bios, the video of Bryan Ferry's \\"Is Your Love Strong Enough\\" (I always loved that song, and it was really cool to see who was playing the guitar solo! I won't give it away...), a couple of deleted scenes ( The overlong 4 Goblins opening, and the lost Fairy Dance sequence), and tons of other stuff.<br />   Legend: The Ultimate Edition is a great value, and provides a rare view into just how different a few cuts can make a movie.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I saw Norah sing one song with Willie Nelson on tv recently.  Her composure and unusual voice in that one song of Willie's led me to buy the cd at once.  The music she sings is hard to clasify, its easily seduces you so that you play it again and again.  Her voice and style are unique, and the tunes on the cd are tailor-made, written by her or for her, with the exception of three classics strongly interpreted into her style. We listen to a wide variety of music; this cd is our favorite by far.

Well I do and have and all i gotta say is that simple plan is awesome, with their songs like, the worst day ever, and im just a kid....what do you expect....move over new found glory i think simple plan should be heading the next few Vans Warped Tour...buy this cd, and others, you wont regret it, these kids got talent....!! rock on...... !!
B000060P79|5.0|This CD is SLAMMIN!  Perfect for all occasions: partying, hanging out, no reason whatsoever.  It's 40 minutes and 10 seconds of pure adrenaline!  I'm truly ADDICTED to this CD!
B00005OAIE|5.0|&quot;Editor&quot; Rickey Wright's review of John Mayer's debut CD &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is not only invalid but rather incoherent as well. Wright seems to be one of the many who worship Dave Matthews as the beginning and end of music as we know it. His rambling seems to be more a sorry attempt at intelligence and snobbery than an actual review. If Wright had taken the necessary steps in reviewing Mayer's album he would have discovered an already polished songwriter whose introspective lyrics provoke thought rather than the bland repitition that plagues much of popular music. Wright is correct in one observation when he states that Mayer seems to be singing and forgetting that there are others present. I agree but I personally find it refreshing to hear an honest approach and response to Mayer's problems rather than a contrite solution meant to appease the listener. Mayer invites the listener into his world in which the listener can identify with his issues rather than forcing himself into the lives of a diverse listening community. Mayer is a force to be reckoned with and an amazing talent. &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is a remarkable debut album.
6304806426|5.0|Yes, the acting is superb and the cinematography amazing, but this movie is one to be watched again and again for the symbolism and motifs of the story. <br /> Each of the four main characters represents one of the 4 elements: Almasy - air, Katherine - water, Hanna - fire, and Kip - earth.  Only recently, I caught Almasy's comment about problems being solved more easisly if everyone could see the disputed land from the air, and I got chills the first time I realized the # of the bomb Kip reads was K1PP###.  Besides the elemental symbolism, the ideas of identity, nationality and ownership are also woven throughout the tale with such subtly that you can't believe how often they appear when you look for them.  And how wonderful is it that Almasy is literally drawing lines in the sand as a pre-war cartographer?<br />\\"The English Patient\\" is a movie to own and cherish!

B000065U1N|1.0|This is truely a boring movie.  Yes it is all action, shooting, shoooting shooting, but there is absolutely nothing interesting. The scenes are not really well thought out, and the characters are so superficial.  I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
B00003CXS4|5.0|There several interesting aspects of this movie to highlight:<BR>The movie takes place with caracters that seem to come from the down and obscure world of modern England, where robbery and own-hand justice rule the scenario. Then, you will certainly notice the type of language this people use, sometimes impossible to understand and I guess even the English have trouble with it. <BR>Now, with Brad Pitt (Mickey), he may be a pretty face, but in this film he is a tough and rude gypsy bare-knuckle boxer who takes the best out of people (materialisticly speaking, of course) and at the end of the movie... well, you will drop you jaw to the floor when you get there.<BR>It is interesting to notice that this film takes in several completely different stories from totally different people that have to do nothing with each other, until destiny places them in the same place, at the same time and in the nastiest of the situations. <BR>If you saw \\"Amores Perros\\", this is the type of Snatch. An exciting movie where everything is put together at the best of the movie, and where action is combined with caracter's intelligence to glue you on your seat until the movie is over. <BR>By the way, there wouldn't be movie without the dog, so pay attention to what this amazing fellow does throughout the film.
B000002I2G|5.0|Let me just say that it cracks me up when people claim the Doors we're turning into a teen band by the time this album came out.. IT's CALLED TRYING SOMETHING NEW PEOPLE! This Album was an album the Doors wanted to do to try something different... it contains some of the greatest poet-rock lyrics out there and anyone that bashes the album clearly Isn't a TRUE fan... Runnin Blue is possibly one of the great good time songs ever recorded and a great tribute to otis redding... Also The Soft Parade song is MAYBE the most innovative songs of the 60's and it paved the way for alot of the electronic music out there today... Of Course for the fans who only have like pure top 10 hits, this ISN'T THE ALBUM for you... But For True Doors Fans who want to hear the Doors at there Artistic peak, this is the album for you! THE SOFT PARADE HAS NOW BEGUN!and once you pop it in you're stereo, YOU'LL NEVER WANT IT TO END!
B00001IVOR|5.0|It actually makes perfect sense that the Wu would expand and stretch out on their sophomore LP. A double album is needed to actually give all the members of the crew ample space to rhyme and fully flesh out thier individual persona's. The RZA tops himself over and over again on these tracks, finding a million different variations on his kickdrum/snare(boom-boom-bap, ba boom boom bap!) combination. His beats are so heavy thay actually make my head hurt! Just listen to the brutal soundscapes he paints on &quot;Reunited&quot; (the catchiest hook on the album, never has a curse word been better incorporated into a song chorus) and the even heavier &quot;For Heaven's Sake&quot;, notice how he slows down the tempo on the verses and speeds it up on the choruses, brilliant! This is a sprawling masterwork that redefines the genre' and is an impossible act to follow. Stunning from Start To Finish.
1565847032|5.0|This book is a collection of speeches and Q&A sessions edited and organized to provide a coherent view of Chomsky's beliefs. It does a tremendous job of summarizing much of Chomsky's work. If you have ever wondered what he's about this is *THE* book to get.<br />This isn't a book someone sat down 5-15 years ago to write as a research project. Instead it similar to the speeches and Q&A sessions you see on C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 (e.g. the ones where book authors talk about their books and then answer questions). If you like those then you'll at least like the format/feel of this book.<br />I should also provide a warning to those who have not been exposed to the ideas presented in this book -- the closest analogy I have is taking the red pill in the movie The Matrix...
6302891124|5.0|Casablanca is one of my favorite classic films and is just magnificent! Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were wonderful and I liked all of the supporting cast but my favorite was Peter Lorre. Casablanca is very highly recommended but only in black & white, the colorised version looks dorky and fake and it should be watched the way it was originally filmed anyway!
B000065AQU|5.0|We're living in a time where bands will go with the flow, and just do what the people want.  It's once in a million when a band doesn't care about everyone else, and makes the music they want...and it's this music that people enjoy more.  The most obvious examples:  Nirvana popping out and starting what we call &quot;rock&quot; today.  Then bands like KoRn, with a most distinctive sound, that it would be suicide trying to make similar music.  Limp Bizkit (though overplayed themselves and no longer exist) made the rap/rock combonation more popular.  Since then, rock has layed pretty dormant.  Until a little 4-piece band from god knows where and armed with funny names, antics, and poetic justice lyrics hits the scene.  System Of A Down's first album shook the music nation, showing that what the band likes is what you'll like.  Their new album &quot;Toxicity&quot; is an even better dish of poetic justice, and guitar riffs that are so simple, but fun to listen to.  There is NO song on this album that doesn't reflect SOD's unique sound and personnae.  If you're tired of where rock and metal is today, sick of repetitive bands doing what other  people tell them to, then buy this album and/or their first one.  You will not regret it.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver was an extrordinary book that opened up my imagination, and even though I had to read it for language arts I'm glad I did.  All through this book I discovered things as if I was Jonas trying to piece things togther.  It was written well with depth and understanding.  It isn't just a book about a boy in a strange society; It's a book connecting to our daily lives and controversies happening right now. This is a very good book!

B00005V9HH|5.0|To understand and feel the true quality of The Usual Suspects one needs to watch the movie more than once.  Each viewing will bring a different perspective.  Kevin Spacey takes the role of verbal painting a perfect changing picture. Director Bryan Singer is a great visionary.  His ability to translate ideas to film is astounding.  I don't understand why he hasn't had more films.<br />The best part of the Special Edition is Special Features.  Before entering the special features section I recommend watching the movie two or three times.  Form a good opinion on the plot and the characters.  Then endulge for the directors and actors point of view.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This CD is a must have the songs are all great, I have not heard an artist this good in a long time she is just great.  I can not understand how come she did not win not one grammy awards this is just not fair.  The songs are all great I just purchase the CD seven days ago and I have not stop playing it at work in the car at home and on the train it is just that good.  Some artist may only have one or two good songs on their entire CD but India. Arie entire album is all good go out and get it you will not be disapointed.
B000065U1N|5.0|i have to admit i only wanted to see this movie because ewan macgregor plays in it, but it is a wonderful movie. i never even knew about what was going on over there until i saw the movie. all of the actors did a great job. it was action all the way through. let me tell you i was on the edge of my seat, and i'm a girl. so if you love action and war movies then this is definitely the movie for you. i kind of regret not seeing it in the theater.
B00003CXRP|4.0|This mainstream stuff generally makes me balk, but Cast Away isn't half bad. It is excellently made, and makes for a wonderful evening's entertainment. The special effects are superior and convincing, especially the crash scene. All credit to Zemeckis for not launching into the crash too early on in the film, too.<br />In fact, it is fitting that this movie is so well-paced, since it is a movie about time - its effects, its value and its dangers. It is a theme which is often delicately weaved into the plot, but at other times shoved in the audience's face with little subtlety. Nevertheless, it provides for much drama, compelling and often genuinely moving.
B000063S6Z|4.0|I was a convert of Moby's music after the ubiquitous &quot;Play&quot;.<BR>A stunner whose purity and true emotion complexities touched me so that buying &quot;Play&quot;'s followup,&quot;18&quot;,wasn't even a question for me.<br />Fortunately,&quot;18&quot;-while not as stunning as &quot;Play&quot;-is a very impressive album.Like &quot;Play&quot;,&quot;18&quot; is very emotional and pure sounding.Like &quot;Play&quot;,it also features emotive vocals-from Angie Stone to Sylvia Robinson to Sinead O'Connor-over contemporary<BR>beats.Yet it works.<br />Among the standouts is the first single &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot;,a smart New Wave-influenced track which is greatly arrangened,&quot;In This World&quot; which features a hauntingly beautiful<BR>vocal from Jennifer Page,&quot;One Of These Mornings&quot;,which like &quot;World&quot; features a hauntingly beautiful soulful Gospel-esque vocal(this time courtsey of Dianne McCaulley) over a convincing beat equipped with a moving sythnizied string setting.<br />&quot;Sunday(A Day Before My Birthday)&quot;-a symbolic nod to September<BR>11th(Moby's birthday is September 11th)-and &quot;At Least We Tried&quot;<BR>(featuring a beautiful vocal from Freedom Bremner) will get the tear ducts open.&quot;Harbour&quot; featuring Sinead O'Connor is yet another moving passage.<br />But I can't speak of standouts without mentioning &quot;Jam For The Ladies&quot;.A superb cut featuring the smooth,silky vocals of<BR>Angie Stone and a infectious rap from the now legendary MC Lyte<BR>(I haven't heard from her in so long,it's geat to hear from her!) with a old-school hip hop beat and funky slap beat.<BR>This is easily the most likeable track on &quot;18&quot;.This has a slightly similiar vibe to Moby's hit &quot;Bodyrock&quot;.I predict that this'll be a big hit for Moby if released as a single.<br />&quot;18&quot; does have a couple setbacks though(just a couple).<BR>It's kind of redundant after a while and  instrumental tracks<BR>like &quot;Fireworks&quot; and the title track don't work as well.Also,&quot;18&quot; is very melancholy and it might drop your mood a bit.But the pensive vibe makes the music even more beautiful and moving.<br />Moby does it again.Another top-knotch release.Even though it doesn't surpass &quot;Play&quot; this is a very above-average album.<BR>Some may not understand it but nevertheless,&quot;18&quot; proves that Moby makes emotive music with purpose.

B00005YU1O|5.0|Why do we dream?<BR>Is it just a way for our brain to sift through the sights and sounds and smells and other sensations we experience in day to day life, and pack them away?<BR>Or is there a deeper meaning? Are dreams really messages coming from the subconcious, trying to force themselves into our awareness?<BR>Are they prophecies of events to come?<BR>Or are dreams merely another reality, one that works much like this one except that we have no set limits, and we can see the results of our choices so much sooner?<BR>And when you have gotten all that you can gather from the dream, whatever its purpose may be, do you decide to go on to another dream, or wake up?<BR>For that matter, how do you wake up?<br />Waking Life (2001, rated R) broaches the subject in such a way that even the most intelligently skeptical cynic has to sit down and consider the possibilities. The film first grabs your attention with the surrealistic visuals, that make the viewer think of something he once dreamed about. The photographers filmed the flick digitally in the everyday Hollywood way, and the graphic artists worked their magic. The viewer sits, captivated by the individuality of the filmwork, and notices almost immediately how real the soundtrack is, in contrast with the absurdity of the visuals. As like in a dream, where one can't always believe what he sees, but can always trust what he hears.<br />After Waking Life was released in October 2001, Bob Sabiston, the graphic designer, was nominated for Digital Effects Artist of the Year for the 2001 American Film Institute Awards. The film was also nominated for IFP/West Independent Spirit Awards' Best Feature, Best Director, and Best Screenplay, in 2002. Waking Life won Best Experimental Film from the National Society of Film Critics, and Best Animated Film from the New York Film Critics Circle, both in 2001.<br />But awards don't say much about personal impact. This really is a movie that, to get the best feel for, a person has to watch. One cannot judge it by what someone else says. The film takes leaps and twists and loops where one could not anticipate... just like a dream would. Every last detail, including a mosquito, has it's very specific purpose, and it's up to the viewer to decide what it is. Waking Life takes place in a world with no beginning and no end, and where everyone speaks in quotes of Sartre, Kierkegaarde, Kafka, and Camus... and you know exactly what they all mean. At times sacrilegious, and others... just plain religious, this is a very thought-provoking, philosophizing work of art.<br />You really should find out for yourself just how unbelievably moving this piece is, but... if you need any more convincing, here's a quote from Roger Ebert:<br />&quot;I have seen &quot;Waking Life&quot; three times now. I want to see it again--not to master it, or even to remember it better (I would not want to read the screenplay), but simply to experience all of these ideas, all of this passion, the very act of trying to figure things out. It must be depressing to believe that you have been supplied with all the answers, that you must believe them and to question them is disloyal, or a sin. Were we given minds in order to fear their questions?&quot;
B00005V9HA|4.0|If you like The Night of the Living Dead Trilogy and the Evil Dead trilogy you'll love this.  It's got everything to satisfy your demented little and desturbing urges, including, a guy orally rapeing a college student with his decapitated head, a big naked zombie knocking down doors and intestines that leap out and strangle a guy.  On top of this, a really good storyline, which is both disturbingly funny and scary and some great dialouge and qoutes.  I give it four decapitations, a disembowelment. (five disembowlements is the best).
0790729628|5.0|I wish the &quot;geniuses&quot; over at Warner Bros. would finally release this on a new DVD with the picture and sound that this movie deserves.

B00005B36H|2.0|What can I say? Lateralus simply bores me to death.  I used to be a fan of Tool's.  I loved AEnima, so i was pretty excited to hear that the band was releasing a new cd.  Schism was a decent song upon first listen, and i was expecting better with the rest of the songs.  I listened to the album a few times, I WANTED to like it.  But alas, i didnt.  It's such a shame.  The only reason I gave this album two stars is because i like Parabola.  Too bad Tool has become a victim of overhype.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I read in previous reviews that people were unhappy about Emma's historical inaccuracies, and disloyalty to the book by Jane Austen. Honestly, I have never read the book, and I know absolutely nothing about the clothing or social mannerisms from that period of time. However, I -do- know that Emma is a wonderful movie. Despite the fact that it may not be true to the book, and is historically inaccurate, it does very well as a romantic comedy. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Emma, and I love her confused and indignant expressions throughout the film. Mr. Knightley is definitely my favorite character, and is the perfect gentleman. Every other character fits seamlessly into the mix, and Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill is a yummy and surprising treat. Each and every scene is thoroughly enjoyable.<br />For nights when you're home alone, and stuck with only your dog and your DVDs, pop in Emma! It'll cheer you up, make you smile, and leave you with a happy feeling inside for a long time afterwards. Who cares how historically correct it is? It's just a really awesome movie!
B0000011P7|2.0|At the risk of becoming a pariah among Tull/Ian Anderson fans, I must respectfully give this work low marks. Divinities is an enjoyable kind-of-classical-but-not excursion in orchestral music, and The Secret Language of Birds is one of the best albums of all time (at least of what albums I've heard). But, unfortunately, when it comes to IA's solo career, three is a crowd.<br />Walk Into Light, it seems to me, is a manifestation of Mr. Anderson's early eighties desire not to be seen as \\"out of it.\\" This is understandable, considering that Tull was a favorite critical dartboard at the time. Granted, Tull's music in the early eighties did garner marginally better critical reviews, but in the process it seems that over half of Tull's core audience was offended by the new changes in direction. Now audience desire by itself shouldn't be the prime motivation of artists, yet it can be used as a tool to determine if the proposed new direction has enough merit to risk alienating that audience. And early eighties techno really didn't possess that merit, in my opinion.<br />Ian used Peter Vettese, then Tull's keyboard player, as a collaborator on this record. So, we're already in the hole. Vettese contributes icy-yet-cheesy synthesizers, questionable songwriting, and mechanical vocals. Ian's voice is in nice shape and you can almost hear the flute in some places.<br />Fly By Night was the record's best shot at a hit single. Despite the superfluous keyboards and a very stilted drum machine, it has a certain melodic appeal. Made In England offers about 20 seconds of relief from the oppressive keyboards with some tasteful Strat work by Ian during its opening. Then, back to the plastic ivories. Walk Into Light is a song with personal lyrics and more irritating keyboards, and that goes for User-Friendly and Black and White Television.<br />End Game is a nice song; maybe Ian put something in Peter's drink. Unfortunately, whatever it was didn't last long. Vettese shows up during the song's bridge with some rather awful synths. Trains is really just bad; an emasculated Locomotive Breath, if you will. Toad In The Hole has some of the more understated mechanical effects, as does also Looking For Eden. Different Germany is my favorite on the record. The use of the synthetic accordion is pretty clever, and the middle section is good. This same section of music was used as the \\"balloon music\\" on Jethro Tull: Live at Hammersmith '84, albeit much more shrilly. Apparently, neo-fascism was on the rise in Germany, if one listens to the lyrics. I was 7 when this came out, so personally I can't recall. At any event, Ian seems disturbed by something Teutonic.the song's bridge with some rather awful synths. Trains is really just bad; an emasculated Locomotive Breath, if you will.

B00003CXI1|5.0|Why are all of these reviews so darn -bad-? I'm very surprised, especially since so many people are buying this DVD! Having only seen Harry Potter 3 times, I am nevertheless convinced that it is a great movie. It obviously didn't completely measure up to the book, but neither did Lord of the Rings, and that was the -best- movie ever. So despite the movie's inferiority to the book, I enjoyed it immensely, and the DVD as well. The special features are really fun, especially having to get to the deleted scenes. People complained that it was too much hassle to find the deleted scenes, but seriously... if you had time to buy the Harry Potter DVD and watch the special features on it, you have time to play a game in order to watch the deleted scenes.<br />I admit that the movie could have been a little more scary, and possibly more creative, but all in all, it's a great film for young and old alike. If you're a fan of the books, you really ought to see the movie!

B00000JTB2|5.0|This CD represents a single, wonderful blues recording of the collaboration of traditional bluesman Albert King and smoldering blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughn.  The disc offers a nice variety of tempo and technique, and the guitar work is simply sublime, the musical equivalent of slow cookin' on a summer evening.
B00006690F|5.0|I was really surprised by how good Eminem's new CD is,being that i have never really been a fan of his in the past. He has definitely gone through some changes--he has evolved as an artist and as a person. I don't understand how some people are giving this album negative reviews...but hey,there will always be haters who voice their opinions. I could go on and on with how incredibly great this CD is,but chances are most of you have already heard it,considering that it has sold over 2 MILLION copies! I know we are only half way through the year,but it is truly going to be hard for any other album to top \\"The Eminem Show\\" for Album of the Year!
B000066C1N|5.0|I first heard 'Here I Am' in an empty theater just before 'Spiderman' was about to be screened. The moment I heard the song, I was nearly moved to tears. I could recognize Bryan Adams' hoarse voice from anywhere. I initially thought he had a new album out that I didn't know about..which was near darn impossible because where I come from, Bryan Adams is phenomenally big. A quick online check culled the soundtrack of Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron. I can totally imagine Spirit singing 'Here I Am', telling his story to humanity...that he is born to be wild and free, and his spirit will be broken in captivity. Mind-blowingly beautiful. May Spirit live on forever.
B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Crow is at her best on this album, showing great arrangments, fantastic harmonies and a newfound maturity in her lyrics.<br />&quot;Steve McQueen&quot; and &quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot; are happy upbeat rockers.  Not to mention the rollers, &quot;You're An Original&quot; and the title cut &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot;.  She also develops a very relaxing mood piece on &quot;Safe And Sound&quot; with the help of a synthesizer keyboard and soft vocals.<br />There are quite a few guest vocalists, but Don Henley confirms her Eagles influence by dueting on the beautiful ballad, &quot;It's So Easy&quot;.  Her country-western is not forgotton (once again) on &quot;Abilene&quot;, a longful song with slide guitar.  The best harmonies on the album exist on the intricately vocal harmonies of &quot;Diamond Road&quot;.  It's a Sheryl Crow classic.<br />Closing out the album is the raspy, throaty blues number, &quot;Weather Channel&quot;.  What a great finish to a great album.  No wonder it's her best seller to date.
B0000399WI|5.0|Atmosphere, sadness, joy, exhiliration, drama, tension, this movie has it all in huge dollops.  Absolutely first class acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in this emotional roller coaster ride through prison life filmed on location at Shawshank prison.  The narration by Morgan Freeman is a spot of brilliance by Director Frank Darabont and sets this apart from other similar movies such as the Green Mile.  This is a movie about the resilience of the human spirit in the face of cruel odds.  Its difficult to watch at times and the viewer is bombarded with the whole range of human emotions.  The basic nature of the DVD doesn't do the movie justice, but that aside, this is one of the all time great movies.
B00003CXI1|5.0|this was [a great] movie it was just like the book in all aspects<BR>expeasaly quidditch. that was cool. this movie was the best movie i ever seen thats parcally close the book.
B000002C1V|1.0|When I first perchased a copy of this Cd, I thought it would be the best thing I've done in my entire life, it turned out to be the worst thing I've ever done. The songs are too boring and too long and the sound of the album sounds like a carton of clam chowder dropped on the deck of a pirate ship on a cloudy tuesday. After I listen to the entire Cd I crushed and threw it inot the garbage. I like Pink Floyd but this album [stinks], if you like bands like The Pansy Division or The Culture club and Richard Wrights solo album Wet Dream , you're going to love this CD but if you like Pink Floyd and any other good music, you'll want to destroy it. One plus, the solo in the Fletcher Memorial home brought me to tears and I cried for hours because it was so beautiful. The Final Cut is not the cutting but final is it?
0380788624|4.0|First, it must be said that Stephenson either cannot or will not write an ending. I suffered through the \\"Big U\\", I loved \\"Snow Crash\\" and still have no idea what his point was with \\"Diamond Age\\" (The Chinese will someday rule the world? OK, fine. Kids with adult participation in their lives have unlimited potential? Duh.) and I really, really like this book. Still, when it comes time to end the stories, we seem to finish when he runs out of ink, and not when the tale has been told. <br />Each of his stories seem to be inflicted at some point with John Sayles disease: This is everything I know about (fill in the blank). So why four stars? When he is good, which is most of the time, the sermons about religion, math etc. really fade from your conciousness. The characters are vivid and compelling. The action is funny even while tragic. The sidebar on Yamamoto's death is very funny, very moving and does a terrific job of quickly summing up the dreadful waste of war. The best men, on meaniless tasks, set up to die by superiors that are clearly inferior men. <br />Cryptonomicon is better everytime I read it. I have read the entire work several times, as well as following the story lines of Bobby Shaftoe, Goto Dengo, Randy Waterhouse and Lawrence Waterhouse each separately. The story holds up until the end, where I had to wonder if our heroes could actually accomplish the goals they set if they were actually successful and, of course, the abrupt termination of a really good yarn.<br />If this IS the first of a series, I'm down for the rest of the tale. While he may not be my first choice to baby sit my kids, Stephenson can count on me to line up at story time!
B00000ING2|4.0|I've always been a fan of the Coen Brothers, and even though this DVD edition is very poor on features, the movie is so good it's still worthy of any collection. \\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\" is my favorite Coen movie, specially because of the inclusion of Sam Raimi as co-writer. This film was the first big-studio production for the Coen Brothers, and it has everything that makes them  \\"one\\" of the biggest names in independent film-making. It deals with a very difficult genre of comedy, that which is fast-talking and very witty. In fact, there may be a few jokes that you´ll only get after you see the movie a couple of times. It's so full of details and symbols that you´ll have a great time trying to see them all. It's also the most ambitious art direction the Coens ever had. Too bad that such a great movie doesn´t have a decent DVD edition, one with (at least) a couple of features to separate it from the rest of the pack.<br />Oh, I almost forgot, watch out for some really cool cameo appearances like Sam Raimi, Peter Ghalaguer and Anna Nicole Smith (as Zsa Zsa Gabor) and Steve Buscemi.
038533558X|5.0|This is the first book by Coben that I have read not in the wonderful Myron Bolitar series. (If you are not a Bolitar fan, keep reading.)<br />It is a unique tear-jerker of a mystery.  At some point, the main character's mother, old girlfriend and current girlfriend all die - two murdered one natural.  All are wrapped up in his brother's possible run from justice.  Like Coben's other novels, the plot twists and turns and takes the main character and the reader through the labyrinth together.  In this book, Mr. Coben piles on layers of emotions tied to the deaths, both violent and natural.<br />One of the most enjoyable aspects of this novel is that the main character can not and should not be referred to as the \\"hero.\\"  Unlike Grisham's novels where the amateurs always outsmart the professional killers, Will Klein is an admitted coward and keeps coming up on the short end of both the mental and physical battles he undertakes.<br />A great read.  Different enough from the Bolitar series that those who might not have loved that character (I am not one of them) will enjoy this book; the style abnd fine writing are similar enough that Coben's fans will continue to enjoy him.
0671024256|5.0|Whether you like Stephen King as a writer or not, &quot;On Writing&quot; is a must in your personal library. King gives in this book a view of how he managed to build the necessary discipline for his &quot;craft&quot; as a one of the best-selling fiction writers of all time. You'll especially appreciate his advise on drafts, language, character development, and even some tips on how to make your work accesible to publishing houses and literary agents. It's like being on a workshop with the King himself. Fun to read, insightful, and useful for any aspiring writer, no matter the genre.
B00003CXI1|2.0|TWO [marginal] stars!  Yet another misplaced Luke Skywalker clone-type saga - will it never end? AND just where is the originality?  A totally unrealistic fantasy about 'boarding-school'!<br />Some of the 'effects' throw us straight into Great George Pal territory! Not sure if that's a good or bad thing.<br />Maggie Smith, Richard Harris [Camelot's misplaced Merlin?] could have phoned their performances in!<br />The best thing of all? ALAN RICKMAN! Says more with just a glance.....<br />Only IF you must.....
B000066F6H|5.0|...The songs were written by the band but under their real names. I dont really think Dangerous and Destruction are traditional swedish surnames, hint. The band is fun. the album is energetic.  I ordered the import a year ago(is that before they were manufactered?) and it still sounds fun  be it on my stereo or the radio and mtv. If you dont like it due to the exposier, sorry. if it aint you thing after hearing it you still, respect given to you. If you like the energy of the stooges and the (i'm) stranded era Saints or newer groups like the new bomb turks and the devil dogs give the hives a look. see'um live cus...its that much better with Howlin' Pelle's humourous hype and rants. i still got the bruses
B000062XFG|5.0|I haven't seen the shows since they went off the air, and I just finished the 2nd season. The episodes are actually really good if you can get past the campy planet scenes. The only stinker is \\"Shades of Grey\\" which is one of those crappy look back at the last 2 seasons episodes. The set is only 6 discs, I wish they had cut a price break on this! Great set though.
B000002WU9|5.0|The intro to the album is a conversation from Ghostface (who appears on almost every song) and Rae and it shows what these guys and this album was all about. They talk of business plans and it carries over to the second track, the gun shots and car driving sampled Knuckleheadz. Its a good low key song that you could vibe to with a verse from U-God. The theme continues with the cut Knowledge God, a mafioso Wu Gambinos joint. The next two cuts, the intense Criminology and the famous Incarcerated Scarfaces, however, serve to straight heat up the album. These cuts dope. From there you can't overlook the hard yet smooth Rainy Days. Charged with the black chick vocals, it then goes to more rhymes from Tony Starks. (Speaking of which, Ghostface, with his plethora of rhymes to aid The Chef, was just hugely responsible, perhaps even as much as Raekwon and RZA, for this LP.) Guillotine, the 9th track featuring INS, is another solid cut from Rae and his n1ggaZ. As Ghostface Killah puts it:<br /> its a dosage,<BR> you overdose-this rap,<BR> high explosives,<BR> my postage,<BR> hipnotized with hipnosis,<br /> Wu Tang Clan, in this case Rae and Ghostface, is some deep material sometimes. The skit Biters serves to intimidate other MCs and keep em from bitin. Predictable Raekwon style. After that, the haunting Ice Water with CappaDonna is pretty hot. All I have to say is \\"Tommy Hil ice rockin' n1ggaz, AAWWWW\\" (if you hear the song youll know what I mean). Much like most of the rest of the LP its not spectacular persay but its quite ill because its so solid. RZAs sample of the AAAWWW adds a nice touch. After that comes the beautiful Glaciers of Ice. Although Ghostface starts with some jibberish (that's what I would call it, I don't know) it gets good later. This along with Ice Cream and Rainy Days and Incarcerated... are my personal favorite cuts. Another Wu member, the monotone knowledge-dropping Masta Killa pops up to kick his most def verbage of all times:<br /> Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony,<BR> Degrees of punishment increase intensely,<BR> Syndrome was caused by the deadly drum,<BR> But the battle was won by swords being swung,<BR> Slicin with the vocal - from the international vocalist,<BR> Ya style is too local to ufck with this,<br /> Verbal Intercourse features the prophet Nas lending a deep verse to the Clan. Maybe a bit overrated but its a fair song beginning to end. You might be able to tell that this was amidst Nasir Jones' transformation from Illmatic's Nasty Nas to It Was Written's Nas Escobar. The sample on Wisdom Body is funny and then comes Spot Rushers. I didn't really care about these cuts but then what comes after restores order in the album. The aforementioned Ice Cream is probably the most recognizable song of the record with Wu guests Method Man, CappaDonna, and of course Ghostface. If you didn't know, Ice Cream isn't really much like the rest of the album in the way that its just about women. The metaphor of how women are like Ice Cream (Puerto Ricans are Butter Pecans... French girls are French Vanillas and that sort of caca) and the whole hook and everything is what made it a classic:<BR> <BR> caramel complection breath smellin like cinnamon,<BR> excuse me hon the Don means no harm turn around again,<BR> ah damn backyards bangin like a Benzi,<BR> if I were jiggy - you'd be spotted like Spot MacKenzie,<br /> Oh yeah not to mention that song basically gave CappaDonna (Cappucino) a career and probably later helped his The Pillage LP go gold. Wu-Gambinos gets back to business as usual and is appropriate, I mean thats what the whole album is about, right? Some have said that the song was highly influential in what other rappers were doing at the time and basically verified the 'Biters' skit. The last cut is a solid, heartfelt one. Heaven & Hell is that slow emotional stuff from Rae and Ghost.<br /> I don't know if its the best solo (I guess you classify it as solo) Wu LP ever; the point can be argued. Onething is for sure, Only Built for... is at the very least a worthy effort and good for rap. Raekwon and Ghost were a great combo of the storyteller and the intense rhyme-wrecker for this one. I definitely liked it.
014028009X|5.0|This book is funny, funny, funny! Also entertaining, touching, and very well written. Do not pay attention to Amazon reviewers who critiqued Bridget for not being British enough (much of the British slang, dates, etc. were changed for American publication) or for being an update of Pride and Prejudice (it is an obvious theme of the book and meant to be noticed-I mean come on, his name is Mark DARCY). You root for Bridget from the start because she is like us. She is a disaster, but it is reassuring to know that there are other women out there who do not have it all together. Loved it! Read this book...

B000002BBY|5.0|It's quite obvious that over the last 8 years, oasis have produced some of the best music in recent memory and have established themselves as heroes of modern day rock n roll and have reached the height of success that such artists as the rolling stones, the police, led zeppelin, elton john, and the beatles have been graced with. Morning Glory remains to be the one album that defined the true essence of oasis, thanks to the songs' author and composer Noel Gallagher who stands today on the shoulder of giants. over the 8 years that have passed, however, their 1995 mega epic Morning Glory is still their best outing.<br />The entire album is outrageous and it still sounds pure when i put it in my disc player and play it from start to finish. beginning with \\"Hello\\" and ending with a champagne supernova in the sky, one goes through 1000 different emotions in the duration of less than an hour. you jump and cheer and roll with \\"roll with it\\", you get butterflies in your stomach with \\"wonderwall\\", you remember your past and dare to look back in anger with \\"don't look back in anger\\", you feel a sudden rush, a pump of warm blood running through your veins with every tone of liam's voice singing \\"hey now\\", you dread on the bad pop music you've been hearing for ages and hope the song never ends when you hear \\"some might say\\", you sigh, sob or cry when you face the sun and \\"cast no shadow\\", you get all electric and shine and sing along happily to \\"she's electric\\", you then get another sudden rush like a shot of adrenaline that was just pumped into your veins and you walk to the sound of the favorite tune called \\"morning glory\\", and finally you get back to your senses and mellow out to a conclusion that seems at that moment long awaited, and it seems that it's coming to you faster than a cannonball but slowly walking down the hall of your mind with a \\"champagne supernova\\" in the sky. what art! what beauty! genuine. magnificent, spectacular, moving, slick, cool. you play it again and again and again and you never say stop!<br />this is the best album of the nineties. oasis are to be recognized forever as kings of cool britannica, the honorable embassadors of the 90's generation rock n roll.<br />whether the critics decide to keep on pounding them artistically or give em a break, Morning Glory will come out and shout out straight in their faces the words \\"today is the day that all the world will see\\". the world will still see and hope that today will last forever.nd again and again and you never say stop!<br />this is the best album of the nineties. oasis are to be recognized forever as kings of cool britannica, the honorable embassadors of the 90's generation rock n roll. <br />whether the critics decide to keep on pounding them artistically or give em a break, Morning Glory will come out and shout out straight in their faces the words \\"today is the day that all the world will see\\". the world will still see and hope that today will last forever.
B000065U1N|1.0|Nice action and acting all around, but this is not what happened in real life people.  Read the book by Mark Bowden - one of the survivors.  Find out why he and others are no longer with the military.
B00004VWA7|5.0|I can't believe that, when this was released on vinyl 26 years ago, that it sold quite poorly, despite being nominated for a few Grammies and despite the music and musicians being so wonderful!! I mean, Herbie Hancock is all over this recording, and I thought that everything he touched turned into gold! Anyhow, this is some fantastic music....even if you only heard the first tune \\"Donna Lee\\", it would be worth the price of the entire disc. Although this song was written by either Charlie Parker or Miles Davis (I don't remember), and has/had been covered countless times, the way that Jaco played it was just.....amazing. As a matter of fact, I don't think that Jaco was aware of how wonderful and innovative that track was until he listened to it! <BR>  So much good music.....I don't want to indulge into every single song, but there are some standouts, and those that stand completely on their own. \\"Come on, Come over\\" is great, a very funky tune with Sam and Dave (most famous for the Motown hit 'Soul Man') singing. \\"Continuum\\" is very nice, a slow, lulling kind of ballad. \\"Kuru/Speak like an Angel is amazing....you have to hear those string arrangements, it doesn't sound physically possible for ANY orchestra to do something like that! <BR>  \\"Portrait of Tracy\\" is gorgeous....a solo bass tune, and played entirely with harmonics (a kind of octave that is fretted lightly over the fret), it is just.....wow. \\"Opus Pocus\\" sounds like an evil Carribean band at first.....those steel drums playing that kind of lurching riff. \\"Okonkole Y Trompa\\" is a grooving percussion/bass tune, and (Used To Be a) Cha-Cha is almost strictly a jam with a guest flute player Hubert Laws. In fact, there are guest musicians all over this recording: everyone from David Sanborn to Don Alias. \\"Forgotten Love\\" is a gorgeous orchestral piece with Herbie Hancock, Jaco being absent from the tune, perhaps to just listen.....<BR>   The extra tracks are good.....not really songs as much as just improvisations: an alternate take of (Used to Be a) Cha-Cha, and 6/4 Jam.....therefore, I feel that only diehard fans and collectors will treasure these extra tunes.....I myself do like them, and they add to the length of the CD, justifying the cost completely.<BR>   I don't really know much about Jaco.....i've read some things about him, interviews and whatnot.....I bought this CD after having been such a fan of Weather Report, and I really am interested to know more about this man. I've looked at the website run by his family, ... which is a great site. Jaco suffered from manic depression and drug use later in life, and his daughter Mary wrote a wonderful article about living with depression....look for it if you can, it's worth the search. Without straying too far from the material of the disc, I just want to say that Jaco was indeed the greatest bass player, and, if anything, the legacy he has left behind, which is less important than the actual music and the man himself, will be enough to keep him in our hearts and our ears. A definite 5 star recording.
B000066NW0|5.0|I was pleasantly suprised by the sound of new comer teen Avril Lavigne. From her first single &quot;Complicated&quot; I knew she was a female not afraid to speak her mind, and who has her own style. Though the album trails away from what we expected, it is a nice mix and glimpse into her diverse listening pleasures. Two outstanding tracks that grabbed my attention were the first single &quot;Losing Grip&quot; which burst into a vocal blast of vulnerability and strength simultaneously. My next favorite, &quot;With You&quot; reminds many of us of times when we felt alone and confused in this world and instead of taking it out on someone personally she expresses herself through song. I admire Avril for her song writing skills and honesty and individuality. &quot;ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY&quot; rings true in an honest and at times shocking visual of her words. I give this album a high recommendation. If you dont have it, i recommend it.
B000002L42|5.0|I don't understand these reviews with the guys saying &quot;this music is tired/old/dead/uninspired&quot;....this music has a lot of energy, the music is happening, these guys/girls are happening! True, Donald Fagen's voice isn't quite as strong as it once was, but give the guy a break, he was in his late 40's/50's by the time this CD was made! <BR>  The musicians are at the top of their game.....there's a LOT of saxophone here, 3 guys in fact, and one or all of them solo in most of the songs. There are a lot of solos on here, a lot of jamming out....lots of guitar, tasty guitar solos, tasty with a capital.....well, you know! The drums are awe-inspiring, very energetic, Dennis Chambers! He's an incredible drummer, you should hear the stuff he's done with John McLaughlin!! Peter Erskine plays on one or two of the tunes....he's great, although I don't really connect with his playing as much as I do with Chambers....I can hear the jaws dropping now!<BR>   Get this, if you really dig Steely Dan, like jam-oriented tunes, if you like big sax arrangements, guitar solos, high-quality sound, and if you just like funky music....check this out. Steely Dan is great, although &quot;Two Against Nature&quot; or whatever it's called isn't that great.....i'd stay away from it, unless you like really boring music.
0140434143|4.0|I read many novels, many of them classics in under a week.  This one took me a MONTH!  I found the beginning to be extremely slow, but the book did pick up in the end.  I can't really decide whether or not I liked Fanny, but she did need a little self-confidence.  Edmund seemed a little too good to be true, and Aunt Norris was a total witch.  I had a hard time believing the character relationships in this book as they seemed impossible because the people were HORRIBLE to eachother.  Also, Uncle Bertram seemed to have a complete reformation that was a little unbelievable.  I dragged through this book until it picked up at the end.  I was sad to see it end, and I think Austen could have devoted more than 2 pages to Fanny and Edmund's romance at the end because it took so long to happen, though who am I to be a critic, I could never write anything close to Jane Austen!  Read this book for the ending, but don't expect it be a fast read!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead has proven to be a band in a constantly evolving state. Never becoming stale, they have a talent for pushing the music to the limit. It seems that now, in retrospective, that the most unique way to look at this album is as another process in the evolution of this always-moving band.<br />Radiohead may not deliver any smash hits like &quot;Creep&quot; on this album, but making hits never was Radiohead's game. Tracks like &quot;Airbag&quot; soar over beautifully laced guitar work, while melancholy songs like &quot;Karma Police&quot; have an almost anti-pop appeal, blending sound pop melodies with dissonant strains barely escaping from Thom Yorke's lips. In many ways, Radiohead sort of reminds you of all those appreciated-but-underappreciated artists like &quot;Pink Floyd,&quot; &quot;Tool&quot; and &quot;Nine Inch Nails.&quot; Radiohead's music is not usually dark sounding, but they deliver more of a punch than most metal bands today.
B00004RFFI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  The characters are fun, the movie puts you on the edge of your seat at times, and there's some humor thrown in as well.
B00005QZWI|5.0|After seeing the movie, I was blown away. I couldn't believe what I had just seen. Righ away I bought the books and began reading them. I also knew that I had to have the soundtrack. The music after the part when Gandalf falls from the bridge is the most amazing piece of music I've heard. After seeing the movie for the sixth time (I've seen it seven times), and listening to the soundtack constantly, and after reading all the books, this movie has become the greatest thing that ever happened to this world. My favorite track is #17.
B00000JJHZ|5.0|i disagree with the reviewer that said to buy the enhanced CD instead. Bonus tracks have nothing on the increased fidelity of DVD. Note that this remaster is only at 96kHz, which is half the capacity of DVD-Audio, but more than twice the quality of CD. <br />I use this particular DVD-A to demonstrate the difference in quality vs. the CD and every single person that has heard it has come away amazed. The difference in timbre, the bend of the notes, the sustain of the piano, all come through so much more vibrant on DVD-A.<br />So my recommendation is buy this DVD, even if you already have the CD (or in my case, the CD, cassette and LP!)

The illustrations by Barry Moser, woodcuts that progress chronologically through Dr. Jekyll's life as it is described in hints throughout Robert Louis Stevenson's story, are atmospheric and evocative; a picture of a boy being guided by his father, for example, echoes Dr. Jekyll's comments that he has a \\"fatherly\\" interest in his alter-ego, Hyde, while Hyde has a son's \\"indifference\\" to the father; the cover illustration is a portrait of Dr. Jekyll's father destroyed by Mr. Hyde on a rampage.<br />Joyce Carol Oates's introduction is worthwhile, especially for those readers who know the story, as most English-speaking people do, in its basic framework, but who have not yet actually traveled the dark road with Dr. Jekyll and his friends.<br />It is a pleasure to read a classic book in such a carefully crafted edition.  Too often books such as this are printed in cheap editions with narrow margins and lousy type; this one fits comfortably in the hand and is easy on the eye as the reader is drawn into this allegorical nightmare.<br />This review refers to the University of Nebraska Press edition only.

B00005B3Z6|5.0|I loved this mini-series so much that I forked out the 70 odd quid for the American version just so that I could spend more time with Stuart and Vince (Brian and Michael).<br />As you might have suspected, I ended up a little disappointed.  This is not because the American version is bad - but it's very different.  I believe it's inferior but that's just my own taste.<br />The truth is, if you like the American version, you probably wouldn't like the British version and vice versa.<br />As a reviewer said below, the UK version is grittier, not as glamourous or as \\"sweet\\".  It's more ambiguous, darker and unapologetically un-PC with few easy \\"messages\\".  It's also, therefore, more realistic.  <br />Phil's funeral is a great case in point.  As opposed to his American alter-ego who just slipped into a coma, Phil died.  And yes, Stuart and the gang weren't exactly sobbing or even particularly respectful.  But what did you expect?  They're portrayed as self-absorbed wankers - charming and attractive but still basically egotistical.  However, that episode, largely through Vince, voices the series' somewhat ambivalent attitide to aspects of contemporary gay life - something which gives a greater depth and resonance to the whole thing.  <br />However, you can't fault the US series for not doing what it didn't set out to do.<br />The plot of the original was driven by the largely sexless relationship between Stuart and Vince, and how their unspoken love for each other expressed itself; with Nathan (\\"The one-night stand that never went away\\") acting as an introduction to their world and a catalyst for the story.<br />Although those of us who love the original might mourn the lack of focus on the central relationship between the main characters - the US version is much much longer and more of an emsemble, so letting that relationship drive the plot makes little sense as there is no defined ending.  And the American version is MEANT to be glitzier and \\"easier\\" - a sort of gay \\"Sex and the City\\".  As such, it succeeds very well.  Entertainly eye-candy that can nonetheless be very thought-provoking at times.  If the sex gets a little dull, I just remind myself that, as a straight female, I'm probaby not the best audience for the series.<br />But ah!! That last scene with Stuart and Vince dancing like complete utter twats to #It's Raining Men# but not giving a folk - that scene proves conclusively that you can both laugh and cry at the same time.  Pure Magic.
B00006690G|4.0|eminem has been great for such a long time. THis album proves that it will be so empty without him. Great beats, great rapping, and strong points and disses(lol limp bizkit). Listen to some of the songs first though before you make your decision. In case you're in doubt, it's the eminem we know up to the next level. Great rapping and lyrics \\"till i collapse\\" and \\"White America\\". Worth buying!
0380778556|5.0|When I found this book at a local book-shop, I had not expected the brilliance inside the poetic pages.  Decieving plots and characters littered the many words that deprived the reader of sense with the beauty of the novel.<br />The nameless narrator arrives at Manderly, with a brief and secretive husband, Maxim de Winter.  Yet the narrater, so shy and naive, feels out of place at the enchanted home, empty now and odd as the late Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, had already left her mark of impressiojn upon everyone ever setting foot in Manderly.<br />The servant of Rebecca, potently loyal Mrs. Danvers, is the main nemisis.  Using her and many of the other servants, Daphne du Maurier creats a stunning picture of Rebecca just from the emotions shown of these people, though Rebecca has beern dead through the book.<br />After strange and cruel unwelcomings, the naiuve narrater finds herself prior to the deciete of Mrs. Danvers and the evil yet devoted Mr. Favell, cousin of Rebecca.  When a random yet plotted string of events takes place that hurts the narrater to the core.  Yet further breaking points in Maxim and Mrs. Danvers releasing important clues that bring Maxim closer to the narrater and building confidence against Mrs. Danvers.<br />As her confidence grows stronger and love more profound, she discovers something that will change her life forevert--as th secrets of Rebecca unravel...<br />This book is slow in the beginning, but patient readers will find that the book is brilliantly written andpersonally, almost creepy.  Myself, you will find that every spare moment not withthe book, you will be thiking of Rebecca...
0671027344|5.0|This book touched me in a way I never thought a book could. My friend was reading this book, only a few pages in, and told me to buy it, so after he finished it I read it. I started it at dinner time and read the whole way through. I have never once cried from a book, or even laughed out loud, until I read this. I was amazed, you felt so close to the character and when he hurt, you hurt too. There were a few lines in this book that I actually burst out laughing, and read it over and over because I couldnt believe how good the book is. My boyfriend hates reading so I am going to read this book to him, you can relate to charlie so much and im so glad I read this book, it changed me.
B000002R9X|4.0|As far as I'm concerned, nobody did that celtic/medieval/re-<br />naissance music thing better than GENTLE GIANT. JETHRO TULL did<br />the same thing on SONGS FROM THE WOOD, tho' I think GG did it<br />much better! Tis a shame this album didn't sell as well as SONGS!<br />FREEHAND was GENTLE GIANT's most popular album, at least in the<br />U.S. and there's no doubt that GG were at the height of their<br />powers around this time. FREEHAND is full of catchy, yet very<br />complex songs. JUST THE SAME has a slightly funky feel to it;well<br />as funky as GG could get and has a great vocal from DEREK.KERRY<br />MINNEAR gets in some of his best singing on ON REFLECTION; a<br />beautiful little song with some very typical GG vocal rounds and<br />a very sweet poignant vocal from MINNEAR. I never cared for their<br />live presentation of this song with all them recorders! The title<br />track is another solid hard rock/pop song, with more of MINNEAR's<br />electric piano and/or clavinet playing. The celtic/medieval in-<br />fluence shows up the strongest on the instrumental TALYBONT.<br />HIS LAST VOYAGE has another nice vocal from MINNEAR and also some<br />nice interplay between GARY GREEN's guitar and RAY SHULMAN's<br />bass; this little interplay was one of GG's trademarks.<br /> The mix on the ONE WAY RECORDS cd is slightly different than the<br />mix on the original album; this is most apparent on TIME TO KILL,<br />especially in the vocal tracks.<br />FREEHAND is not my favorite GG album, tho it is an album I would<br />start people off with as an intro to GENTLE GIANT.
B00005OAIE|3.0|John Mayer is a singer/songwriter slash pop star.  Room for Squares is not a great album, but it's not a bad album.  He lacks motivation and inspiration.  He sings as though he is half asleep and the songs seem to have been written when he was asleep.  I could very easily point out the good qualities in Mayer, but that's what every other review has done.  I write this review in contrast to what everybody else thinks, that he is the best new artist out there.  Not so, those who believe this to be true should listen to David Gray, Gary Jules or Mason Jennings.
B00005YUNY|4.0|First let me say that this is a must have for any Yes fan. However...Although the orchestra does a good job filling the void, Rick Wakeman is still missed. It's just not quite completely Yes without him. His stand-in does a competent job on keyboards, but how does one replace the Master. The 'Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman & Howe: An Evening of Yes' video suffers a similar problem with the absence of Chris Squire (who is thankfully present in Symphonic Live). I wish the classic lineup could get together just once for posterity.<br />Okay - enough complaining. Great musicianship & a great concert.<br />I'm giving it 4 stars only because Rick Wakeman is missing in action.
6305736650|5.0|When I first purchased my DVD player, &quot;Casablanca&quot; was one of the first DVDs I ran out and purchased.  I first saw this film on TV as a teenager.  Despite my past lack of interest in &quot;old black and white movies,&quot; I fell in love with this movie instantly.  The acting was superb (Bogart and Bergman share an amazing on-screen chemistry).  The storyline grabs your attention.  Even the supporting cast was excellent.  Add the classic score of &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; into the mix, you've got one of the most romantic films ever made. &quot;Casablanca&quot; is my favorite movie of all time.  It's a true classic and it certainly has changed my views of &quot;black and white movies.&quot;
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's album &quot;Let Go&quot; is a great example of what music is all about.  She writes all her songs and expresses her feelings.  All teenagers can relate to this album because they all have experienced what she writes about. <BR>Avril has diversity in her songs from pop, punk, to rock.  Her songs &quot;Complicated&quot;, &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;, &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;, &quot;My World&quot;, and &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; all have a bit of a pop sound and are incredible.  The nice more slow songs are &quot;I'm With You&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Too Much To Ask&quot;, and &quot;Naked.&quot; Her songs that have that rock-edge sound are &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, &quot;Mobile&quot;, and &quot;Unwanted.&quot;  Her song &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot; is more punk.  She does have a band so all the instruments are real and everything really comes together well because her voice is so amazing.  If you've only heard her voice in &quot;Complicated&quot; you should really buy her album because there are so many sides to her that you haven't heard and you would really be missing out.  I hope this review gives you a boost to go and buy Avril's album…I seriously have told all my friends about her and I got ten of them to buy her cd and they all love it, I know you will too =)
B000065U1N|2.0|The DVD contains 2 trailers: &quot;Spiderman&quot; and &quot;the One.&quot;<BR>There is no trailer of Black hawk Down.  The makers of the DVD decided to use it as a comercial to advertise their other films.<BR>I happen to like trailers and I happen to like commentaries from the director.  This DVD contains neither. I expected more from Jerry Bruckheimer&amp; Co. especially since this is an important movie.<br />The picture quality is good.  The audio could be better.<br />A Good Movie.  A Poor DVD.
B000000H3W|5.0|Wow, what a classic album! I didn't think I'd like this one as good as Beneath The Remains before I got it, but I do. In fact sometimes I like it better. A little slower than BTR, but it has more variety and rocks just as hard (and STILL plenty fast). Every track is a standout IMO, but my favorites are, 'Arise' 'Dead Embryonic Cells' 'Subtraction' and 'Desperate Cry'. The gold remastered disk that I have has four bonus tracks; Orgasmatron (Motorhead cover), Intro, C.I.U. (Criminals In Uniform), and Desperate Cry [Scott Burns Mix]. In fact C.I.U. is one of my favorites as well, and it is ashame it was left off the original release. Well, what else do I have to say to make you buy this? I'm horrible at reviewing stuff, so just buy the [...] out of this, NOW!<br />Oh yeah, in the liner notes Max talks about his experience while recording Orgasmatron. \\" I remember recording it completely f'ed up,\\" he says, laughing. \\"I drank half a bottle of rum before we even started. All I remember is singing the first lines, then waking up the next morning and going on tour. I asked the guys, 'did we finish the song?' and they said, 'yeah, you did the whole thing.' And I was like, 'wow, I finished the whole song?' And they kept saying, 'yeah, you did!' Then we listened and it was pretty good!\\"

B00002MZ4W|5.0|I just wanted to add 5 start to this worth 5 starts cd.
B000002UB3|5.0|Although Let It Be was the last Beatles album to be released, Abbey Road was the last to be recorded by the Fabs, and what a truly awesome way to end the legacy of The Beatles. Let It Be is quite a good album, as it contains some  timeless classics (the title cut, Across the Universe, The Long and Winding Road) and other worthy numbers (Get Back, I've Got a Feeling, Two of Us, For You Blue). However, it is marred by Phil Spector's hit-and-miss production job-some of his work is stellar, other bits are poor. Also, Let It Be would be a considerably stronger record if the filler such as Maggie Mae and Dig It were removed completely and the mediocre Dig A Pony was replaced by the solid single Don't Let Me Down. Even if Let It Be had these improvements it would still have a difficult time being matched up against the dazzling masterpiece that is Abbey Road.<br /> Abbey Road is possibly The Beatles' crowning achievement, though it faces heavy competition from Revolver and Sgt.Pepper. I absolutely love The White Album, as it is by far their most ambitious and sprawling work, but track-for-track it is not as solid as the others. I may respect the White Album more than the others because of its incredible diversity and its superb musical quality (Lennon himself said the quality of the music was superior to all their other albums, and that's why he liked it best), but it doesn't mean I enjoy it as much. But enough about The Beatles' other albums, now I'll talk about Abbey Road.<br />As with Revolver and The White Album, every Beatle is well represented. Harrison finally steps out of Lennon and McCartney's shadows to create the two finest songs on the album, the beautiful ballads Something (my personal favorite here) and Here Comes the Sun. Lennon's contributions to Side 1 of the record are the powerful, hard-rocking Come Together and I Want You(She's So Heavy). Oh! Darling is a nice 50s-style done-me-wrong blues/rock screamer, but it is the bizzare Maxwell's Silver Hammer that steals the show for Sir Paul on Side 1. The irony of this song is delicious, as there are some of the most morbid lyrics ever written in classic rock (it could even be viewed as a companion piece to The Rolling Stones' Midnight Rambler, I mean after all they're both about serial killers!?) sang to a delightful pop melody, and they perfectly offset one another. Even good old Ringo has a song, Octopus's Garden, which happens to be somewhat of a sequel to Yellow Submarine, and both songs are wonderful. The other song on Side 1 is the gorgeous Because, highlighted by soaring harmonies.<br /> Side 2 starts off with You Never Give Me Your Money, an excellent McCartney-penned tune about The Beatles' financial troubles. YNGMYM segues right into the relaxing, wistful Sun King, and begins the first of the two medleys that make up Side 2. These medleys are sheer works of genius, and are a testament to the brilliance of The Beatles and of course, producer George Martin (the idea for the medleys was McCartney's, by the way). The other songs on the first medley are Mean Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam, and She Came in Through the Bathroom Window, all of them featuring impressive guitar hooks. The next medley is quite different, with the touching Golden Slumbers leading into Carry That Weight, a fantastic track which works very well as a bridge between Golden Slumbers and the epic conclusion, The End. The End is basically few lyrics with three distinct guitar solos from Harrison, Lennon, and McCartney(in that order) and Starr's only recorded drum solo, and a fine one at that! Her Majesty is a nice bit of humor that works very well to end the album.<br /> The best Beatles album?. As I said about Revolver in my review of it, perhaps. I really can't decide. But anyway, go out and do yourself a favor and buy Abbey Road. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is a great Disney movie and it's now found it's proper home on DVD.  While the movie is not as fully-restored as Snow White was for the digital realm, the movie looks and sounds better than ever.  Being a 60th anniversary edition, Disney also jam-packed the disc with extra features, including a disturbing look at the upcoming Dumbo II...hehehe, well, maybe that's not such a good thing...oh well.  Dumbo is wonderful, and HIGHLY recommended!
B00005V3Z4|1.0|Trusted a friend's judgement &amp; got this DVD from him. It is unbelievably bad. I sat through the whole movie even though I was tempted to<br />go to bed as I thought everything will be clear in the end &amp; the so-called twist will be fascinating &amp; make up for the dull bits. Unfortunately I ended up with a bad movie on DVD &amp; a friend whose judgement I don't trust anymore. Or was he just trying to get rid of his copy?
B0000508U6|5.0|It seems that most CDs I buy (and I buy *a lot*) have maybe three good songs and the rest is just filler.  I bought this CD on the strength of the song \\"Yellow\\" and was blown away by the rest of the tracks.  I can honestly say that there isn't one single song that I don't like or that I skip.  In fact, I listen to this CD at least once a day and haven't gotten tired of it yet.<br />Personal favorites are \\"Shiver\\", which has ultra-soothing lyrics & melodies; the slightly eerie \\"Spies\\"; the very romantic-feeling \\"Sparks\\"; the stripped-bare sound of \\"Parachutes\\"; and the hopeful \\"Everything's Not Lost.\\"  However, as any fan of this CD can tell you, choosing a favorite few songs is tough: every track is great.<br />As soon as Coldplay releases a follow-up, I will buy it without hearing it first & without reservation, as they are a great band.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|This is a pretty mediocre movie when it comes to plot, but rather enjoyable with the technical achievements and that is what in my opinion, can make a pretty good movie.<br />... What makes a good movie to me is special effects, set design and action.<br />If you can imagine yourself in this movie, its a fun and enjoyable movie.  Worthy of a dvd purchase.
B00006419T|5.0|I had only heard of the song Porcelain and I didn't even know who the artist was. Then I discovered MOBY. I purchased 18 in hopes that I would enjoy this CD as much.  You will not be disappointed. I am in awe of this man and his music, it is like nothing I have ever heard before.  I have since then purchased Play that has Porcelain on it.  It is wonderful also. Do something good for yourself, buy 18, you won't regret it.
B00003CXRP|4.0|A reduced cast, great crash scene, and good acting makes this a movie that has been reduced by one DVD at Best Buy.<br />Tom Hanks, once again, makes a great presentation as a castaway on a deserted isle.  He keeps himself sane by making a best friend... one that we all wish we could have, that never talks your ear off, talks back, agrees with your every idea, never criticizes or judges you... a volleyball.  Simply blissfull.<br />I call mine Spalding.<br />Great movie, and worth a DVD purchase.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love this CD!!  Avril has a wonderful voice and a tremendous amount of energy.  I purchased the CD and I seriously love every song on it and relate to them as well, which makes it an incredible CD to listen to.  Her video is fun to watch and the band does a wonderful job with the music.  I highly recommend you purchase this CD, you will not regret it!
B000056BP4|5.0|There is no doubt in my mind this is one of the most incredible pre-digital special effects epics ever made.  Heston's performance is outstanding... the direction, the music and cinematography is first rate, but I thought someone should mention a remarkable performance by the late Stephen Boyd... who died far too soon.... he was a marvelous actor and as Masala, he brought out a nasty, revengeful, and mean-sprited man in 3 full dimensions. His death scene is nothing short of miraculous... whew!! Bravo Stephen!!<br />This is one of my personal \\"best movies of all time\\"... no doubt.<br />The DVD is superb and will leave you spellbound!
B00005NWM3|3.0|a decent cd, talented artists, good music, it just all sounds the same, no big high points or low points, it sounds like one big long song
B000066NW0|5.0|There's simply no other word for avril's new cd &quot; let go&quot; but amazing.  Due to record sales I'm obviously not the only one who thinks so.  Last week she reached number eight on the billboard charts and I undoubtedly believe that she will reach number one very soon.  This cd clearly showcases Avril's fresh and edgy style.  She is herself and doesn't care who disagrees with her.  Her album consists of punk rock hits such as her hit single &quot; complicated&quot; and &quot;skater boy &quot;.  Also, it's got edgy melodies like &quot; I'm with you&quot;.  She's definitely a breath of fresh air in our teen diva society.
B000066NW0|5.0|'Let Go' is by far the BEST cd i've ever heard/ bought/ ever WILL get. I relate to every single song. And not just me, teens all over and even some adults (a.k.a. my mom!!). There is a song for everyday, good days, bad days, rainy days, and just &quot;I need something good to listen to&quot; days! Avril is a great role-model and her CD expresses her individual characteristics. I rate this cd on a scale from 1-10...a definite 15!
0446677450|2.0|I didn't like this book very much. It is because he praises his \\"Rich Dad\\" more than his real Dad who is \\"Poor Dad.\\" I can't feel his any respect for his real Dad. The worse, he says about his dad that he is like a looser. But I think he is not, he did give him the advice. Simply he was too young to understand it. He is very particular about money.<br />On the other hand, it was interesting to know his childhood. Now he has a lot of money, but when he was a child, he was poor. He even couldn't choose his friends. But now, he is criticizing what he was in the past. And he didn't know how to make money then. I think it's too bad to embarrass the poor people, especially once he was poor, too. He should have encouraged them somewhere in this book. Instead of just embarrass them. He is the typical person who once get money, and forget what he was before....   <br />If you really want to know how to make money and you decide to do whatever you do to make money, I think you should read this book. But if you just like reading or looking for books make you feel better and is good, you shouldn't buy this book. Especially, you are in the middle class people.
B0000549B0|5.0|Jimmy Stewart's Elwood P. Dowd remains one of the most likeable characters. Why shouldn't he be? He's a &quot;Hello Mr. Wilson&quot; kind of fellow who attracted a Pooka as a friend.<br />&quot;Harvey,&quot; that innocuous, but rascal rabbit who is Elwood's best friend is a complex figment of Elwood's dreams and lack of clear sobriety. Or is Harvey an invisible rabbit, as genuine as you and I, except large and furry, um... and unseen? You'll need to choose.<br />In one of the most family friendly, yet delightful movies (with a taste of romance), Stewart is a nice guy. Very friendly and about town, he is in some ways the same core person in &quot;Its A Wonderful Life.&quot; In one scene, when his pleasantness is pointed out, he responds something to the affect, &quot;There are two kinds of people in this world: Smart people and pleasant people. For years, I was smart. I prefer pleasant.&quot;<br />The question of insanity comes up quickly, and knowing who is sane and insane is not so simple (I can hear Homer Simpson's famous line in the background). Likewise, what counts as sight is a little fuzzy too.<br />Stewart's intro is better than the usual throw-away intro. He brings insight as to how he played his role, why he looks up though he is the same height as the rabbit, and so forth.<br />I fully recommend &quot;Harvey.&quot; It is a movie safe enough to watch with your church group, funny enough to watch with your parents and romantic enough to watch on a date.<br />Anthony Trendl
B00003CXI1|5.0|Like it says on the back of the case to this movie,\\"THE WIZARD OF OZ OF OUR TIME!\\"I found this movie to be very entertaining.Even if they didn't get the title right,which I thought it was,who cares.I want to see the movie not the title.Anyways,the actors who played Harry,Ron,and Hermione were perfect.Couldn't find any other better kids to play the parts.Richard Harris as Dumbledoore-VERY EXCELLENT CHOICE.Alan Rickman as Prof.Snape was great.The cold evil look and sound of him bring the character very much to the book.Robie Coltraine plays a good Hagrid and Tom Felton brough the bratty,snobbish character of Draco Malfo to life very well.As for the scenes being scary for little kids,its true.But I'd say only for about kids 10 and under.What did you expect from Harry Potter?A bright coloful movie with no intense scenes?The scary moments will be in Prisoner of Azkaban.Then,I'll agree on the 12 and under for the scary moments.Some of the scenes were funny,like the part in the zoo and the scenes in the Dursley's home.The battle with the troll was humorous with the wand getting stuck up his nose and the final confrontation with Lord Voldemort,was pretty cool.Good special effects on the destruction of voldemort.Over all,this a very great movie for people who have read all the books,and maybe for those select people who like fantasy and sci-fi.If you likes it,buy it.Ya hate it,dont waste your time.
B000066NW0|5.0|Hey everyone!I think that you should definatly buy &quot;let go&quot; Because Avril is paving the way into a new world of music. She is the first female artist to start singing punk and she rocks at it. her cd is awesome the songs are sweet espcially number 3 (sk8ter boi) she has a great voice and even plays guitar! she is the exact opoosite of britney spears which has got to be the best thing in the entire world! so go out and buy her cd and lets kick britney spears out of the music industry!!<BR>PUNK ROCK NEVER DIES!
6303567126|5.0|I originally saw this movie when I was very young.  Leo had not become a big star, I didn't even know his name.  But the details of this movie, spanning from drugs to cancer and the lessons learned along the way, I still have not forgotten.  Wonderful real life drama.
B000066NW0|5.0|How to describe this cd is hard.  With all the creative stylings of a mixture of punk, pop, and rock, it's something that you just have to listen to.  The single \\"Complicated\\" draws people in with a message of not being fake with the line \\"Take off all your preppy clothes.\\"  Just looking at Avril you know she's got spunk and attitude.  Other songs like \\"With You\\" and \\"Losing Grip\\" show Avril's powerful voice and the amazing music on this cd.  The lyrics are beautiful written, coming from her heart and they expose her true self to the world.  I can't say enough about this cd.  Her voice is somewhat similar to Alanis Morrisette on some songs, so if you like her, you should definately check this out.  This cd is amazing, even if you don't like Alanis.  So if you are looking for a new artist with creativity, attitude, and just damn good music, buy this cd..highly recomend it.
6305633177|5.0|This is by far NOT the best of Metallica's dvd's, but it takes you back to a time when Metallica was just getting started and didn't really know what they were doing.  This is old school Metallica - the true metalheads at their purest.  This is one of the only productions where you get to see Cliff jamming on the bass and even Mustaine...<BR>Cliff Burton was the best bassist Metallica had, and all of you newbies out there who only know Jason need to get this dvd more than anyone else.  No other band in history comes close to producing the powerful music that Metallica has produced over the years, and this dvd takes you through their beginning.  You will appreciate Metallica more than you ever imagined when you see how much they used to rock.  They were the greatest band in the 80's and they are still kickin' it today.  Poor video quality, but raw Metallica the way a fan would see them in concert.
B000066NW0|5.0|This 17 year old Canadian beauty has an amazing cd with beautiful, powerful lyrics and wonderful tunes.  Her talent for such a young age is amazing and her creative music style keeps you listening to see what is next.  If you like Alanis Morrisette, you should check her out, for some of the songs seem to have that Alanis feel to it..and no..not just because she's from Canada..<BR>I recomend anyone and everyone to check out this cd.  It's a great peice of work.
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is a MUST GET!<BR>All the songs are great!. she has a great voice. shes a great talent! the cd is wonderful, the songs are great, they are very upgoing, and i bet that ur going to like it,, like i did!
B00005O5JV|5.0|A different version of Clueless, Reese Witherspoon seems to fit right into the character of Elle, a portected, rich blonde who gets whatever she wishes.  When her boyfriend dumps her, Elle cannot sit back and watch, she follows her loved one to Harvard, where she is the red spot.  The film is wonderful, the first time I saw it was on the computer, I had downloaded it from Kazaa, despite the poor resolution and tiny scree, I fell in love with Elle and her dog
B000066NW0|5.0|I  think  that  the  album   Let  go    by  Avril  Lavigne  was  awesome! Let  go   has  everything  someone  would  want  to  hear  they   have  good  songs  her  voice and  her  band  that really  knows  how  to play they  will  blow  you  away! Plus  the  songs  are  all  different  you  could  listen   to  Let  go and  no  matter  what  mood   your in  you  can  identify   with at  lest  one  song! Let  go  is a one  hole package  deal of  the  best and  you defiantly   get  more  than  you  pay  for  Let  go! It's  so  awesome  because  you  could  listen  to  Let  go  over  and  over and  you  learn something  new  every  time !Trust  me  I  know that's  all  I  listen  to!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's cd, \\"Let Go\\", is nothing short of amazing!I mean really, how many people want music that they can relate to? Most people right? Well I've come to find that I can relate to the lyrics of her songs. She's honest and just about every song on this album is something you are going through or have experienced(I'm aiming this at women in general.) I mean you can't exactly relate to Britney Spears and being a slave for someone. It's not<BR>cool! Avril Lavigne is different, she is true. She wrote these lyrics and my being 14,i can really relate to her and the emotions she put in her songs. She is so AWESOME, just buy this album, you'll find some song,line, or phrase you can relate to, if not(which i highly doubt), the music still rocks. So basically with this cd, you're getting what really matters. Not some fake stuff trying to conform you into being a \\"slave\\".
B000002J1C|5.0|I have loved this album for 30 years. There are some terrific performances of interesting songs here. The album has an optimistic sound and always lifts my spirits.<br />My favourite tracks are<br />Yours Is No Disgrace. I like the way the simple theme is developed<br />Starship Trooper has some great bass guitar and soaring vocals from Jon Anderson<br />But my favourite of all the tracks is I've Seen All Good People. I love the vocal harmonies, the interesting recorder part, the story about life as a game of chess, and the way they throw in a line from John Lennon's Give Peace A Chance.
B000066NW0|5.0|This new Canadian sensation has the sound that people are looking for! Whatever Canada is doing up there I hope they keep it up. She is quickly climbing the charts on Billboard, the Much Music countdown, and TRL on MTV. You may have heard her song \\"Complicated\\" on the radio. If you love that the rest of the album won't dissapoint you. She is somewhere between Alanis Morisette and new songwriter, Vanessa Carlton. She fills her album tracks with songs that mean something. Some would call it angst Rock n' Roll/Punk music which is true.  But I find it soothes my soul listening to her talk about her search for herself and someone who loves her. Anyone can relate to that feeling. There are also many excellent guitar riffs that keep the music moving. This is definitely something to blast from your car stereo this summer like I so often find myself doing. Whether you are younger or older this is a CD that you'll want to hang on to!
B00004WF68|5.0|I don't think I will ever get tired of Steve Winwood's fabulous voice. It is unique: nobody sings like Steve.<br />The songs are a bit weird, which is what makes them appealing. The band uses interesting tone colours, such as the psychedelic sitar in Paper Sun and the inventive sax and flute sounds created by Chris Wood.<br />My favourite tracks:<br />Heaven Is In Your Mind<br />No Face, No Name, No Number<br />Coloured Rain [Wonderfully arresting opening]<br />The musical arrangements are unusual and still interesting, though I first heard them 30 years ago.<br />The addition of Paper Sun and Smiling Phases is a bonus. Both songs are terrific examples of the psychedelic 60s, which I experienced sonically rather than chemically!

B000066NW0|5.0|I first heard Avril's single complicated and was intersted in the rest of the songs. I heard that the cd was out so i went and bought it. As soon as I listened to the cd i didn't take it out of the cd player in my car. I listened to all the song, but my favorite is sk8rboi. All the songs have some great tunes to it and some good lyrics. I think everyone out there should go and pick up the cd. Avril Lavigne is a great singer for someone her age, and has written some great songs that have feelings that kids around the age of 17 can relate to.
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought the cd a week ago and i cant stop listening to it. All the songs are fantastic from the 1st single \\"complicated\\"(which rocks!) to the oh so awsome song titled \\"Things i'll never say\\" it is just the greatest cd to listen to when u want to get away from it all, it takes u some place else and if u dont have it u should go pick it up right now! AVRIL LAVIGNE debut cd \\"Let Go\\" KICKS ...! and Avril Lavigne is anything but ordinary and that is a good thing!
B00006690G|5.0|The Eminem show is an excellent CD. After the Marshall Mathers LP, i didn't think that he could get any better. But this album proves that he has. Eminem talks about the 3 women in his life (mother, ex-wife, and daughter), the media, etc.. But this time he is very serious. The whole CD is excellent, the stand out songs are \\"White America\\", \\"Business\\", \\"Cleanin out my Closet\\", \\"Square Dance\\",\\"Hailie's Song\\" and \\"Say What You Say\\". The only compliant that I have is about the  song \\"Drips\\"- the song is very nasty and Eminem provides to much information, when you hear the song you understand what i mean.
B00000JGHM|5.0|I love this film because it has such a human side to it. I'm usually one for independent films, but this movie is just flat out excellent. I fell in love with both Pacino and De Niro's characters.  This movie is really deep. Don't be fooled, it's more than just a cops vs. robbers film. The movie is filled with spectacular dialogue, first rate acting, great direction and lighting, and some intense relationships. Also, the music is wonderful.<br />  Did I mention... Pacino is so amazingly awesome and De Niro is just ultimate cool. Even the little facial expressions say a 1,000 words. I mean, look- even the way Pacino chews gum is fascinating!! Buy this film if you want to see a classy story about two guys from opposite sides of the camp who realize they have more in common with each other than they thought. It's almost like a modern-day tragic shakespearean tale. I can watch this movie over and over.
B000066NW0|5.0|WOW!! GO AVRIL! <BR> You are so cool and u rock! don't let anyone tell u differentally! I LOVE your CD!! All the songs mean so much to me! They have really touched me and have helped me through hard times! I also LOVE to sing and you are my idol! Your CD has inspired me and given me the courage to persue my dream!! I can't wait to see you at #1 on TRL! Don't worry u'll be there VERY soon! Trust me! See yas there!! ROCK ON!!
B000066NW0|5.0|I first discovered this talented artist on the MuchMusique channel in Canada. I was very impressed with her vocal skills and self-image.  I anxiously awaited the debut of her first CD, &quot;Let Go&quot;, and I sure wasnt dissapointed. From &quot;Losing Grip&quot; to &quot;Naked&quot;, this album is all about showing who you really are and being proud of it.  Each and every song totally rocks.
0446677450|2.0|I finished \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" completely. I don't like this book very much because I cannot agree with some of author's opinions. Sometimes I felt bored when I read it. I think \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" is a fictional book. I don't believe that he has two dads in his real life and at same time I am not interested in his story.  <br />The author said, \\"The main reason people struggle financially is because they have spent years in school but learned nothing about money. The result is that people learn to work for money...but never learn to have money work for them.\\" I disagree with his opinion. Why do we need to learn something about money in school? I don't think every one must learn how to create money when they were children. For example, I don't think Bill Gates, the richest businessman in the world who was already fascinated with computer when he was 12 years old, learned how to win money when he was a little boy. I think the intelligence and interests are more important for a person. For myself, when I was a student, my parents only required me to study hard and I didn't need to learn how to set up my financial ideas because that wasn't my business. When I went to work, I knew what real finance was because the society was the best teacher. I don't believe his rich dad dropped out of school in eighth grade but now is a millionaire. Spending time to learn finances in the childhood and quit learning in the school sounds so stupid.<br />A reader said, \\"like eating cotton candy while standing on the cloud.\\" I have the similar feeling when I read this book. Some of author's opinions sounded pretty good but that wasn't fit with true life. How on earth can Mr. Kiyosaki imply that people should wait to buy a house until they can pay cash? Who can actually do this? Otherwise, the author said, \\"the poor and the middle class work for money.\\" I don't think so. Who doesn't want to be rich? Nobody! Different people have different financial situations, but the common goal is howto change the life to be better. If everyone can win more money and get successful like the author, I think we will live in an unreal world.<br />My opinion is most people only know about working hard and saving money especially in developed countries. I think this isn't their fault. Who doesn't want to change their life to be better? We can't emphasize personal opinion and neglect the reality. Everything depends on the different situations. Although this book is very popular in U.S., I don't want to recommend it to my friends.
B00006690F|5.0|All I gotta say about this CD is unbelievable and very impressive. Mr. Marshall Mathers III has made an album not like his other ones and that's why many people are hating on this album. I bet that everyone wanted to witness the Eminem who talks about killing his ex-wife and constantly dissing other pop stars but Eminem flips the script totally. Eminem talks about the troubles in his relationship with his ex-wife, Kim, and how he's gotten over them, his relationship with his Mom, Debbie Mathers and how Eminem has changed his life around. Also, the one thing that keeps him alive, his baby Hailie. There are so many issues Eminem talks about in this CD. Here's a breakdown of the best songs on the CD.<br />2. White America - He [criticizes] Ms Cheny, Tipper Core and the whole White House and how his skin color benefits him.<BR>3. Business - A song about Eminem shutting down the phony rappers.<BR>4. Cleaning Out My Closet - One of the most personal songs I've heard from any rapper. He addresses his mother and how he doesn't want nothing to do with her anymore.<BR>5. Square Dance - A song about Eminem telling everyone to stop worrying about the events of 9/11 and be happy with life as it is.<BR>7. Soldier - A song about Slim Shady will still be a soldier even if someone/something tires to break him down.<BR>8. Say Goodbye To Hollywood - Eminem talks about his problems with Kim and that he needs to get out of the spotlight to be with Hailie.<BR>10. Without Me - Everyone knows about this song, very commercial and is very weak compared to the standout tracks.<BR>12. Sing For The Moment - Classic song by Eminem. Most rappers won't even go this far and personal. Eminem even samples Aerosmith's \\"Dream On.\\" The song is about how we sing for the kids and how they will be noticed as legends.<BR>13. Superman - A very funny, uptempo song about how Eminem cannot support a [girl] he's been with even though she likes him.<BR>14. Hailie's Song - A Very touching Ode to his daughter. He even songs to his daughter (the singing is aight). He also talks about how his daughter keeps him alive.<BR>17. Say What U Say - A song featuring Dr. Dre who disses Jermaine Dupri. The diss is aight but the beat is very bouncy and party-like.<BR>18. 'Til I Collapse - Talks about how Eminem still be an innovating rappers until his bones crumple and collapse. A very well put together chorus by Nate Dogg.<BR>19. My Dad's Gone Crazy - The last song where Eminem disses his Mom and Hailie even sings in the chorus. Nicely put together.<br />The only weak songs on the CD is \\"Drips f/Obie Trice\\" and \\"When The Music Stops f/ D-12\\". Other than that, I would give this album a 92/100 or 4.5 mics. One of the best albums of 2002. If you're looking for the commercial-pop..., go to Nelly's \\"Nellyville\\". I guess rap would never be the same Without Him. Go cop tha Eminem Show right now.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is amazing! I love her \\"Let Go\\" CD. It is the one CD i own on which i love every song! Her crystal clear voice and totally original style makes this CD woth picking up any day. She writes all her own music that is about things everyone can relate to and it blows the mind that she is so young and can write and sing such great songs. The future hits that this album has on it are definatly \\"Losing Grip\\", \\"Anything but Ordinary\\", \\"My World\\", and \\"Sk8ter Boi\\". I recomend this CD to anyone who is willing to listen to this amazing new female artist with a outstading voice, and a truly original style
B0000026DJ|5.0|If you're a fan of MO, you probably don't need anyone's review, but if you are just trying to pick your first Midnight Oil CD, it's a great one.  If you listen to it and don't love any of the song, give it up, Midnight Oil might not be for you.
B000066NW0|5.0|I recently purchased AVril's cd LET GO and I simply LUVED it!! The first track on the cd is my favorite it's called \\"LOSING GRIP\\", I was really surprised that the album had more of a pop/rock type of sound; since she obviously exerts more of a punk rock image. Avril's cd definitely proves her musically diverse mentality. The background music is familiar and similar to that of the CRANBERRIES who are really AWESOME. SO OVER ALL I THINK THIS SONG ROCKS !!!! its mellow and her songs are really easy to relate to, lyrics are great NO CLICHEes, no dum meaningless pop lyrics, its ALL REAL, ANd YOU 'll knOw it TOO AFTer YOU GO OUT and BUY THe CD and LISTEN To It ! :) HEr talent is PricelESs and certainly worth more than 15 BUCKS SO YOU\\"LL GET UR MONEY\\"S WORTH .. EASY !!
B000059GEI|3.0|A fine piece of entertainment, There's No Business has however also sides that prevent it from being brilliant. The script is acceptable, though lacking any originality (we follow the career of the Donahues, a family of vaudeville artists) but Walter Lang's direction reveals that this survivor of the still movies era was  completely lost with the wide screen that was assigned to him by 20th Century Fox. Throughout the movie his actors are nicely aligned in front of us, sitting or standing next to each other in order to fill the screen and photographed in full or medium shot. The song and dance numbers are exclusively photographed from a theatre spectator's point of view facing the stage. This was only Cinemascope's second year and many directors had problems in finding how to use this large screen space that was assigned to them. But even so, the musical numbers are brilliant and it is a pleasure to watch them. All of the songs are not of a Berlin top level, but Alexander's Ragtime Band, A Simple Melody and Heat Wave are by all means among his best.<BR>The cast has it's better and it's lesser performances. Ethel Merman is as always a force of nature even if she is less dominating than she had been a year before in the same Walter Lang Call me Madam. Marilyn Monroe is brilliant, as she often was, and so is Donald O'Connor as the funniest character of the whole bunch. Lovely Mitzi Gaynor isn't given much of a chance and Dan Dailey is a little on the stiff side, his real talent only showing when he starts dancing. As to Johnny Ray, one soon understands  why his career in the movies was so short. But with the role he attributed, he hadnt been given much of a chance.<BR>What makes this DVD really worthy is its quality. The transfer to the DVD media was made with utmost care and the result is a beautiful, sharp picture . The comparison with the video version can be seen in the special features and the difference is astounding. We really rediscover here the richnessof technicolor, quite different from that of most MGM-musicals, how great they ever were. The quality of the transfer is one of the major reasons why one should buy this DVD
B000003TA4|5.0|Well, the guy before me knows nothing. Lets put it this way...are the songs hard to play? No. But how does this affect the music, the feeling, the emotion, and the way it sounds. You can write a very complicated piece of music yet it can still be crap. Last time I checked, 3 stars was average. This is not an average album.<br />Ok...enough with that. This is some of the best music I have heard in my life. Think about this... 10+ years after it came out, and people are still talking and listening to it, and new fans are still coming. (I just became a HUGE Nirvana fan in the last 8 months or so). This is not heroin inspidered. Heroin inspired is Alice in Chains. Teen Spirit is about apathy, In Bloom is about those who follow a band without knowing what it stands for, Come as you Are is about viewing people, Lithium is abuot a mental breakdown and trying to console yourself, Polly is about a girl who was kidnapped and tortured, Drain you is abuot love (as said by Kurt), Lounge Act is about liking a girl you can't touch, Stay Away is about the Grunge scene in Seattle, and Something in the Way is abuot living under a bridge, like Kurt did.<br />If you buy this cd, definitly check outu The first 3 songs, Lithium, Drain You, Stay Away, and On a Plain, although alll the songs are good.
B000056VJ7|5.0|\\"Bat Out of Hell,\\" the brilliant collaboration between Meat Loaf and composer Jim Steinman, remains one of the rock classics of all time. And this remastered recording shows why. Not for nothing was this album on the charts for 19 months. A combination of rage, angst, sex and rock opera, \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" was and is a pure original, and it wears just as well today as it did in 1977.<br />All of the well-known classics are on this CD in addition to the title song: \\"Paradise By the Dashboard Light\\" (with the sly play-by-play given by baseball announcer Phil \\"Scooter\\" Rizzuto), \\"You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth,\\" and more. A highlight of this remastered version: two heretofore unreleased live versions: one of Bolero (as you've never heard it before!) and the other of Bat Out of Hell that's even better than the studio recording.<br />This truly is a must-have CD. Dare I say it? They don't make 'em like this anymore.
B00003CXFG|4.0|This movie is a blast. Story is a space crew crash lands on a <BR>planet that has been scorched and has 3 suns blaring down on it<BR>in the daytime.<BR>Only problem is there are vicious, nocturnal creatures that seemingly attack anything that moves. So the story goes a simple<BR>yet sophisticated tale of survival and &quot;lets get the hell outta<BR>here fast!&quot;.<BR>The SFX are fine, acting is credible with toughguy Vin Diesel as the anti-hero battling for survival against these nocturnal nasties whi ch look like a cross between vampire bats &amp; pre-historic pterodactyls<BR>check it out..watch it in Pitch Black
0425170349|5.0|I loved the book. Thought it was great reading, and enjoyed the fact that I didn't finish it in one day.
B000066796|3.0|&quot;Kate and Leopold&quot; is, no matter what fans of Meg Ryan say, Hugh Jackman's film.  He alone lifts this rather lukewarm work up to the level of watchable, enjoyable movie, and he alone deserves good mention from every lovers of romantic comedy.<br />So, the story is simple; for some reason or another, a 19th century gentleman Leopold falls in a rift of time so that he comes to modern-day New York of the 21th century, and meets Kate, working for advertizing company.  That's it.  Leopold, clad in Sgt. Pepper clothes, shows his old-fashioned manners and deportment around in the everyday life of cynical Kate, who doesn't believe a single word of Leopold, but soon finds herself drawn affectionately to this strange guy.<br />As I said, guys, if you don't like these 'chick films,' just watch Hugh Jackman and skip the rest of it.  He IS worth it.  With ease he shows how to grab women's heart, and the great thing about him is, he looks like a real gentleman living in Victorian age.  And moreover, guys, try to learn his humors, which are of course the essential part of his exuding charms.  The way he speaks some English words only makes a fresh version of &quot;Englishman in New York.&quot;<br />About other players, it must be said that director James Mangold didn't do his homework at all, simply content of getting Meg Ryan here as the lead.  Frankly, all I can say is she has played this kind of roles too much.  And other supporting roles are, most regrettably, squandered.  You see sweet Natasha Lyonne, but her role (as a secretary) is too small; with a defter director, she could be better used, or more simply, switch the role of Meg and Natasha, which would give a fresh view to the entire work.  And you leave your seat for a minute, and you will miss the brief, too brief scene of Spalding Gray, whose presence would have given more (quirky) energy to the film than any other players here.  Liev Shreiber and Breckin Meyer appear, but both of them are not allowed to do anything except what they had previously did somewhere else, like &quot;Sphere&quot; or &quot;Road Trip.&quot;  Shame.<br />Overall agreable romance, if you are not trying to find fault with the time-travel setting of the film, which is not the point of the film.  Still, those who loved this would agree with my opinion that &quot;Kate and Leopold&quot; could be much  better with a better-crafted script (the ending especially looks too hurriedly done).  For rainy Sunday afternoon, but you have another choice of far more romantic &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; or &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; just in case you haven't seen  them.
B000060P79|5.0|The whole CD is totally awesome! All their songs are really good!! \\"One Day\\" and \\"You Don't Mean Anything To Me\\" are my faves!! \\"Perfect\\" is also a really good one! Joel from Good Charlotte and Mark from Blink 182 are on this CD on 2 songs on the cd and it just makes the CD 50 times better than it already is! They're also really good live and they sound exactly like they do on the CD. Everyone go buy it and if you get a chance to go and see Simple Plan on the Pop Disaster Tour or on Warped Tour cuz they rock! And they're super nice to :)
0553381709|5.0|George Martin is such a strong writer--one wonders why he wastes all that time editing. This book is everything that the recent episodes of Robert Jordan's once promising, drone-on series isn't. Despite the length of Storm of Swords, it is always focused, always well plotted, and the minor characters move the plot forward to involve the major ones at various junctions that regularly occur.<br /> I won't spoil the book btw--but let's just say if you thought you knew where Martin was going with the series, you were wrong. He has created a powerful plot, with stunning surprises that you won't ever forget.
B000066NW0|5.0|As a new artist, Avril Lavigne totally rocks.  Her music has a message that gives an important meaning.  When I listen to her music, I feel like I can be myself instead of wanting to be someone else.  She is a great role model for pre teens.  She is inspiring and her songs are intense! Her CD is really awesome and her voice is incredible and if you like rock music bands such as Blink182, Sum 41, or No Doubt, you will love Avril Lavigne!
B00000J6AG|2.0|I bought this CD and was struck by how souless it is. The disk is nothing special though it has its moments, mostly in the last third of the disk. I don't understand the hype. Look elsewhere.
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is one of the best to come around in a long time.Its unique and catchy with great lyrics and meaning.There is not one bad song on this cd.I highly encourage you to buy it.You'll be rockin out,I guarantee it!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is a 17 year old from Canada and she's breaking out onto the music scene! I think everyone can relate to her songs and lyrics on this CD. It is well worth your money! Her first single \\"Complicated\\" was a very big hit on the charts! Avril is not afraid to be who she is and she shows that in her songs. She's multi-talented she sings, writes her own music, and plays guitar! I would recommend this to EVERYONE!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album, &quot;Let Go&quot; exhibits an artist beyond her years. Her lyrics can strike a chord as well as her backing band. This young women with her own style has taken over the airwaves with her beautiful voice and deep lyrics. This album is great.
0446677450|5.0|I liked this book so much because it has taught me how o get more money, and how I could manage the money.  I have learned all about my job because it will help me to get more experience in my life, and to earn money, too.  I liked this book because it gave me the opportunity to reach my potencial as a woman with success, so I can become a rich woman someday.  This book gave me an important idea how I can manage my money in the bank, and how I could get my own business, too.  This is a great book, and i recommend reading it as soon as possible because many people learn to work for money, but never learn to have money work for them.
B000002ADT|5.0|I never really bought much jazz until I got this album.  My friend insisted I HAD to own it.  After just listening to the first track, I knew this album was going to have a great deal of influence on me.  This album is as close to perfect as you can get.  The atmosphere is cool, the musicianship is remarkable, and the melodies are incredibly catchy.  I don't think any music fan can listen to this album and say it is horrible.  Even if jazz isn't your type of music, you must respect Miles for his vision.  I love pretty much every song on this album.  Miles, Coltrane, and Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderly prove again and again that they have te creativity and technical knowledge to not only keep your attention throughout their solos, but to endlessly thrill you.  Also a standout, Wynton Kelly's solo on &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; is one of the greatest piano solos I have ever heard.  Kelly only plays on that one song.  Bill Evans plays the rest of the time, and he is an amazing pianist, but he doesn't do much soloing on &quot;So What&quot; or &quot;All Blues&quot;, and I would have liked to hear what he could come up with on them.  However, his piano on &quot;Blue In Green&quot; is gorgeous; this ballad is definitely a highlight, although pretty much every song on this album is a highlight.<br />This album inspired me to buy many more jazz recordings, but I still listen to this one often.  It just never gets old.  I have owned this album for 3 years, and I still get chills up my spine during &quot;So What&quot;.  This album is worth checking out if you're intrigued in jazz.

0446677450|2.0|Money for Nothing<BR> I read the book, Rich Dad Poor Dad written by Robert Kiyosaki, for three weeks.  Before I saw it, I had never read a book about business and money, so this book and author's story looked somewhat fresh at the beginning.  But, now even though it has several interesting points of view, I do not agree with all his opinions because they are too much money-oriented and underestimate the worth of college education.<BR> First, the author's claims tend to be extremely money-oriented.  In my eyes, he lives only for money and is concerned only about it.  Of course, money is important for our normal lives, but it does not bring us all we need.  Even worse than this is that money can make us blind to what is right and what is wrong.  It often debilitates our ability to make reasonable judgments.  Moreover, in this society based on extreme capitalism, there are many people who ruin their lives in pursuit of material wealth.  For this reason, thinking that money can buy all happiness seems very dangerous.  <BR>Second, the author regards college education as a useless thing because it does not help people earn money.  It is nonsense to say that regular education is worthless due to its lack of effect on earning power.  Perhaps it makes sense for people not to study if they go to college only to get diplomas that are useful for getting good jobs.  However, the purpose of college education is to help people accomplish self-actualization through higher learning.  Therefore, I think the author distorts the real significance of learning.<BR> In conclusion, maybe the methods or principles that the author suggests are useful to gather money.  However, he does not recognize the differences between purpose and means of earning money.  I cannot understand why I have to be that money- oriented and ignore the importance of regular education.  Consequently, I do not want to follow all his assertions, although some of them are seemed quite plausible.
6305531374|1.0|Just look at the box cover art ... or watch the film ... Don't you get the sad / sinking feeling that you've seen this before ??? ... Well, chances are you have ... or at least the same movie with different actors ... The is nothing scary or memorable, and Halloween H2O is forced and painfully generic: Jamie Lee Curtis walks through this one as if it were a wireless commercial .... She bad-mouthed the entire horror genre back when it wasn't chic to make horror films, but I suppose with the influx of bad late 90's \\"horror\\", the makers of this forgetable film were able to throw enough money at her so that she changed her tune ... and it shows .... This film looks, ends, sounds, behaves, and plays-out just like every other watered-down horror film of the era .... Why am I reviewing it ??? ... I'm not sure ... I wasted enough time watching it, so maybe I'll just end the review here  ... My suggestions ??? Buy TOURIST TRAP, ALICE SWEET ALICE and BLACK CHRISTMAS : all similar, all scarier, and all much more personal ....
B00004W5A6|5.0|Plenty of people have written reviews of this album. All I wish to comment on is the quality of the SACD transfer.<br />I compared the SACD to the original (not the re-mastered) CD of this album, which has been in my collection for many, many years. I had both queued up in two separate players: a Sony DVP-S9000ES for the CD and a Sony SCD-E555ES for the SACD. I used the DACs in the players and used an &quot;analog direct&quot; setup to ensure that no further signal processing occurred. Levels were matched closely enough that we couldn't identify a difference.<br />With most of the program material we couldn't tell the difference between the two disks. The only difference I noticed with any regularity was a slightly increased sharpness of high transient sounds such as rimshots and cymbals. If there was any difference in guitar, vocals, bass, ambience or spaciousness, we couldn't hear it.<br />There are other albums that I own both a CD and SACD of where I can identify significant differences. In fact, with the multi-channel SACDs that I've listened to, the sound quality is magnificent. This disk just isn't one of them.<br />That said, this is one of my all-time favorite albums. This is my third copy (LP, CD and SACD) and even after almost twenty years it gets played frequently. I certainly recommend the album, but I'm not sure it is worth getting in SACD.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Marilyn Manson's 1998 album MECHANICAL ANIMALS is one of his disputed best albums. While '96's ANTICHRIST SUPERSTAR was genius, I was absolutely floored by MECHANICAL ANIMALS. The album is a significant departure from ANTICHRIST, but it stands on its own. Manson created a more electronic sound, and incorporated it with heavy guitars and percussion. The album is still as controversial as its predessor, look at the cover for an example why. In terms of the music its also pushing the boundaries, delving into topics of religion, drugs, sex and more. The album flows well and all the tracks are superb, there is no filler here. Among my favorites include Mechanical Animals, Disassociative, Rock Is Dead, Posthuman, I Want TO Disappear, User Friendly, New Model No. 15, The Last Day On Earth, The Dope Show, and Coma White, but I've almost listed all the songs, and all of them are great tracks. Overall its a worthwhile album to add to your collection.
B000021Y77|5.0|I am a Dutch Girl who used to live in Germany ,I am married to a US Soldier and lived in the States for a while before being stationed again in Germany now. While in the US I am sorry I missed this movie which was a great hit over here in Germany. I caught this one on TV here and had to order the DVD. Germany rarely makes great flicks, but this is definetely one of their successes. Fast, intelligent, visually exciting with a great pounding soundtrack is what this movie is all about. You get the plot from reading all the other reviews. Being a European I usually am on top of exciting new european avantgarde movies. It took me 2 years to discover this gem, and I am glad I did. If you are young at heart and like to be visually stimulated and have a cosmopolitan mind you will like this one. This is not the movie for your average american joe ( sorry I do not want to insult anybody, but there are people in the States that don't even know where the hell Germany is and think there are still tanks rolling around Berlin ). Europe has come a long way in filmmaking and they do not compare to the Hollywood dreamfactory, however this is a rare exception. Enjoy, kick back and watch LOLA RUN!!
1573225517|2.0|This is only happened to me two times but you know when you are reading a book and all you can think about is you can't wait to start reading another book you had your eye on to read. Well, this is exactly how I felt through this entire book. I always feel like I have to finish a book even if I do not like it, so I kept reading it because I felt I had an obligation as a reader. Throughout the entire read, Rob (main character) kept repeating his opinions and how he felt about the depressing world around him over and over again. It was like revisiting a really [junky] day over and over again at the beginning of each chapter. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because of Barry( a character in the book). He helped me get through this book that I thought would be better. Maybe I will not fully comprehend this book till I am Thirtysomething but until then this book stunk.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD is my favorite CD in my collection right now.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to listen to real tunes.
B000002513|3.0|Really, this is a 3.5 stars album.  Not as tough to love as &quot;Asbury Park&quot; but not nearly as easy as &quot;Born to Run.&quot;  It's short, too, only 7 songs--so it's about one sixth as long as a Springsteen live concert.  Anyway, it's not a bad little album; &quot;Rosalita&quot; is the clear hit, but everything is heartfelt and saturated with that balladeer's earnestness that Bruce does so well.  However, this album might be something to merely round out a collection--I don't think anyone would ever claim it as a favorite.  If you know someone that owns it already, borrow it and give it a test listen.  And be glad they got better on the next record.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love this album! I had only heard Avril's one song &quot;complicated&quot; but I loved it, so I took a chance and bought the cd - I was shocked! Never before have I heard a voice like Avril's! You might want to compare her to the likes of Michelle Branch, but this chick has something else totally of her own. She's got a unique, pump-you-up sound that makes you wanna sing along at the top of your lungs, whether you're driving around town or running through the neighborhood. You can't miss this!
B0000024ZT|3.0|Bruce was NOT &quot;on&quot; this day!  But, I can't give Springsteen any less than 3 stars--the man is just a flat-out entertainer.  <BR>That aside, though:  &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; wasn't even good as a mainstrem hit, and the Boss' version (he wrote it, after all) is pretty bad as well.  The rest of the album is really a labor of love, not only for the young E Streeters just finding their groove, but for diehard fans who want to make it through this sometimes abrasive, sometimes just embarassingly naive effort.  Really, only the diehard need apply--this one is anathema for the merely curious, but, curiously, a must-have for hardcore Bruce fans.  Naturally, it's a product of the musical times--everyone was doing experimental folk/rock/jazz in 1973; but that doesn't make it good.  Thank God Springsteen outgrew it!  Being able to say that your collection is complete might balance out the purchase price for some people, but I'd avoid &quot;Asbury Park&quot; if at all possible.  Anybody want my copy?
B00003CXSP|2.0|First of all, don't expect a good sequel.  This movie is nothing like &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. The original was a very suspenseful psychological thriller, the duration of which you spent on the edge of your seat.  This movie is average in the thriller-like category respect.  As a matter of fact, everything about it is average, which might have gotten it 4 stars.  However, the character of Hannibal is not the same person we met in the first movie. He's different, less interesting and original, more like a common criminal.  So, we're down to three stars.  However, the ending is Horrible.  I can't emphasize it enough.  It's sickening and disturbing.  It's also gratuitous.  I like horror movies, I've watched many films both physically and psychologically disturbing.  But this went beyond it and seemed to have no point.  Thus, I end up with a 2-point rating.  Too bad, &quot;Silence&quot; could have had such a good sequel.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I think Alex made an interesting point, but maybe we're overlooking that fact that this possibly was The Strokes' intention.  I would not, however, go as low as saying that they're as bad as pop.  In my mind, &quot;Last Nite&quot; is better than anything Ms. Spears could manage.  I don't know, I guess I think The Strokes are a fun, retro-type band.  But I mean, like whatever you want to like.  Music is made to be enjoyed, not picked apart by critics.  So how about you shut up and turn up the volume? :)
B000066NW0|5.0|The Avril Lavigne CD \\"Let Go\\" is an AWSOME CD! It's the best cd I have. I love the music not just because it's the music I listen to on an EVERYDAY basis but it's because she's not being fake she is telling you what's on her mind and not [caring] if YOU like it or not, she is only worried about expressing her self and not letting anyone change her into a \\"Britney Spears\\" and that's what I love about her and her music. In MY opinion it's one of those cds where you don't have to skip ANY songs you just love all of 'em. So if you're looking for an AWSOME cd to get buy hers. You won't be let down.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Juliette Binoche,,,,now she is an actress. She's beautiful, sincere, very believable and most important she has talent!  Something american actors and hollywood knows nothing about.  But i digress,,,,,This movie has a great story, great music, great visuals, a few surprises, an actress from the past and the movie flys by because you get so involved in the story. The transfer to DVD is also very good.  The sound is strong and highlights the movie perfectly. Well done!  I was impressed.
0446608955|5.0|This book was awesome!  I couldn't put it down for anything!  It was such a good book and it was so cute!
B000063S6Z|1.0|Well what can I say, Moby has done it again.  He has successfully produced a terrible cd that almost gives electronic music a bad name.  The question is, when will people quit wasting their money on his albums?  When that day comes, maybe Moby will hang it up and quit polluting the airwaves with garbage.  The only thing Moby is good at is whining and complaining about the decent music being relaesed. (No, don't stand up so fast Slim Shady, I'm not talking about you)  According to Moby, we are all made of stars.  Well at least his video was.  Maybe I'm not giving &quot;18&quot; enough credit.  It does sound good while being ejected from a cd player and thrown from a moving car.  Lets all do the music industry a favor and buy cds that are actually worth listening to.  Then we might not have to worry about more noise pollution from Moby and other MTV darlings that don't deserve a record deal in the first place.
B000066NW0|5.0|the cd is great and i want to tell everyone that you should go out and buy it. the songs are great and i sing along with all them. the best songs are complicated and sk8er boi.
B00005J6UP|5.0|This movie was one of my favorites as a child and watching it today relives so many great childhood memories.  This is a great movie for its nostalgic value and its simple, good-hearted storyline.  A must have for all people who grew up in the 80's or for those looking for a movie for their children.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne I LOVE YOU! Avril Lavigne's music describes so many feelings from our (teenage punk's) point of view. I would recommend it to ANYBODY!
B000066NW0|5.0|In my opinion of Avril Lavigne I must say she has a great hold on people. When she sings she sings from the heart and is always her-self I must say she is a good role-model for everyone. In her first cd \\"Avril Lavigne . Let Go\\" the song Complicated has moved lots of people and made #1 on Much Music Count down... I must say Avril Lavinge good job and keep it up with the music from your heart and yes always be your self
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I love this album! It's a classic and I definitely listen to it every Christmas. I can even listen to it in July. Some people say she riffs too much, but for the most part I don't mind. Her voice sounds amazing on this album. Some of my favorites are Christmas Time, This Year, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Angels We Have Heard on High, Merry Christmas, Baby, O Holy Night, and These Are The Special Times. This is a must have Christmas album (it's one of my favorites!)
B000066NW0|5.0|This is by far the best CD I've purchased in a long, long time. &quot;Let Go&quot; isn't exactly what you'd expect from a 17 year old girl. The songs are deep, and mostly everyone could find a song to relate to. Avril appeals to everyone. I'm 14, and a strong fan, while my mom, who is 48, loves Avril, too. I really loved &quot;Let Go&quot; because Avril wrote every single song on the album. To me, this makes her extremely talented. If you can sing and write, you're definitely going to make it in this world because you have talent. And that's exactly what Avril Lavigne has.
B000000WG4|4.0|I picked this album up due to my burgeoning interest in classical music and, I must say, it's pretty good! The fact that portions of its music were used in the motion picture &quot;The Exorcist&quot; alone would not have been enough to make me purchase this album(I'm not in the habit of buying soundtracks), but further research showed that it spawned two sequel albums and an orchestral version of itself, which said that the original must have been pretty good; this, coupled with the fact that it existed outside the film and was not composed especially for the film, swayed me enough to convince me to buy it(besides, I believe true appreciation of music comes from a wide range of styles, so I decided to hopefully expand my tastes and horizons with this album...I was not disappointed).<BR> First off, this is supposed to be a modern-day equivalent of a classical symphony, which, in some respects, it is; but this is also a performance by the artist who composed it, and as a performance, it succeeds far better than as a composition because, try as I may, I cannot imagine a live performance, or continuous live performances such as full-bodied symphonies do, that could equal or surpass this recording; in contrast, Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or Aaron Copland's &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot; both live and breathe independantly of their creators.<BR> It starts off with a repititious piano groove that lays down the foundation for the first half of the piece, with each new instrument bringing in their own type of groove over top of it, some calm and quiet, some electronically loud and obnoxious, but none of them out of place; then there are some assorted choral sounds, and a quiet plateau that leads into an incredibly long climax, which consists of Master Of Ceremonies, Viv Stanishall(of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band) naming off the instruments as they arrive(&quot;Grand Piano&quot;, &quot;Glockenspiel&quot;, &quot;Two Slightly Distorted Guitars&quot;, etc.); the excitementand energy is built as, with each successive instrument, Viv's voice rises to match the crescendo. You can almost SEE the dramatic uplighting on Viv's face as he finally booms, &quot;And now...Tubular Bells!&quot; And these bells know that they're the climax of the piece, so they give forth their loudest, most clearest &quot;BONG! Bong-bong-bong, bong-bong, bong-BONG!&quot; before the whole thing cools down and Mike grabs the coda on guitar, giving a calm ending to a breathtaking experience(though I think he should have resuscitated the piano from the beginning, just to give the whole piece a sense of closure, but that's just me).<BR> On to Side Two, which is, however, most definitely NOT &quot;Tubular Bells-Part 2&quot;, as Oldfield himself titled it. I think he did that more for the sake of album uniformity than the fact that it was a continuation of Side One; a much better title for Side Two would have been &quot;Piltdown Man&quot;, in reference to the caveman supposedly found in a block of ice and who actually makes an appearance on this album(those who've listened to the album know what I'm talking about; for those who haven't, just listen to how funky things get around twelve minutes in to figure out why). I like to think of this track(&quot;Part 2&quot;, &quot;Piltdown Man&quot;, whatever) as a cross-generational sequel of an answer to Igor Stravinky's primitive ballet, &quot;The Rite Of Spring&quot;.<BR> Actually, if this album had been released as a double-sided, dual album consisting of &quot;Tubular Bells/Piltdown Man&quot;, with suitable artwork for their respective sides of the sleeve, it would have been very fitting, I think; but of course, this was Virgin's very first release and it had to be uniform in order to attract people.<BR> I guess it worked, cause this album has been around for, what, thirty years now? And is still sounds as good today as it will tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that...
B000066NW0|5.0|hey Ppl! if you don't have avril lavigne's cd 'Let Go' it is incredibly awesome and id pick your tooshy up rite now to go buy it! This young talented canadian 'crazy wild child' has written songs that almost everyone can relate to.  When you're not having a good day...pop in the cd...when you're having the bestest day you better be listening to that cd! It's a cd for all year round.  Some CDs are just for the certain seasons, but this one isn't.  All ages can listen...she expresses how to be 'anything but ordinary.' Nothing can beat this cd! There is an enhanced version for you to listen and watch.  Get to know more about her b/c you're gonna be seeing alot of her. Peace!
B00006690H|3.0|Since the first time, music fans gave praise to modern rap superstar, Eminem, or Marshall Mathers, audiences have devoured CD, after CD, faithfully following a new \\"minority\\" of a rap superstar.  (Eminem is white, and he's \\"damn\\" even a bit gaudily proud to be so)  Therefore, in his newly released - Eminem Show -Mathers does little to dissappoint the faithful fan and \\"throws around\\" words, phrases, and rhymes with a verterans attitude, and skill.  But, if the one time \\"angry\\" rapper is still preeching his message of violence and frustration with the world it is lost in his new CD.  A greatly evolved artist from his \\"Slim Shady\\" days (Not to dissapoint the faithful fan, \\"Em,\\" as he so eloquently calls himself does evoke the \\"Slim Shady\\" spirit) Eminem finds little need to preech the horror and vile themes of his \\"Stan\\" days.  In stead, a more comfortable artist, Eminem has settled down, and stuck with a more \\"Purple Pill\\" style of rap, evoking more  insults at censors, Tipper Gore, and Lynn Cheney, and fantastic rhymes, than stories of personal destruction and devastation.  Contraversial however, still to the extreme Eminem does take a leading role in his new CD, with songs like \\"White America,\\" and \\"Godybye to Hollywood\\" while introducing a new more, calm artist in \\"Halie's Song,\\" both accepting of his rapper's role, and public lifestyle.  Thus, a \\"good\\" CD in itself - The Eminem Show - can provide the Eminem faithful with hours of entertainment and pleasure.  Yet, a dissapointment in the actual role of Eminem, The Eminem Show is more of a sign of the trasition from angry rapper to experienced veteran, where Marshall Mathers, has become less of the bold artist he once was, absorbed, as are most into the growing American popular culture, and international music industry.
0312265859|2.0|Just finished reading Hard Eight in four hours straight, and after eagerly waiting for its release for a year I'm extremely disappointed.  Its a good enough book, well written, etc but its not the happy-go-lucky romantic comedy that I've come to expect from Janet Evanovich and Stephanie Plum.  ...For those who think the Stephanie Plum series is unrealistic fluff, you'll like this book.  Die-hard fans like me are going to read it anyway, hope you're not as disappointed as I was.

B00005YUPO|4.0|Wonderfully entertaining with lovely classical Bach music.  Stimulating for babies of all ages. <BR>My son loves the Baby Einstien videos especially this one and Baby Mozart. <BR>Every parent must have.
B000066NW0|5.0|What can i say about this album that took my breath away. Out of the blue Avril Lavigne pops out of nowhere with a smash song called 'Complicated!' and now here i am in Music World buying this CD. On my way home i pop in the cd in my walkman while on the bus and listen to Losing Grip.. It such a wicked song! When i get home i call my friends to let them hear some of Avril's songs like I'm With You, Mobile and Skater Boy! They loved it so much we went back to the mall to buy 3 more Avril copies... and GOSH you get a free poster! YAY! This album has to be one of the best i have ever heard. Every song is a smash and I can't wait till Avril does her first Independant tour! AVRIL ROCKS! AND SO DOES HER CD! Gosh.. even her bandmates are cute... what more can we ask for?
B000066NW0|5.0|this is an amazing album. lyrics that get stuck in your head and music to dance to. avril shows her feelings about break ups, following the &quot;in&quot; crowd, feeling lonely, and not letting people change who she really is. if you've seen the video for &quot;complicated&quot; you know she has a lot of talent. she can sing, play guitar, and skateboard. i highly reccomend this album. i guarantee you'll like every single song. rock on avril!
B000066NW0|5.0|In a pop culture of so many &quot;artists&quot; taught to act and talk and sing in a specific way, Avril Lavigne comes as a slap in the face to them. And the rest of the world can't help but smile at that. From the start of her CD &quot;Let Go,&quot; Avril tells us how she does not tolerate with people who are not true to themselves or others, as seen in the rock song &quot;Losing Grip,&quot; where Avril's voice clearly expresses frustration and resentment towards an untrue person in her past and in the guitar-influenced first single &quot;Complicated,&quot; which teaches a life-lesson to those who are afraid to be themselves. Avril shows us her fun side in the story of the &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; and shows us a little about her own life in the up-tempo &quot;My World.&quot; A more serious side of Avril is shown in the lonely &quot;I'm With You&quot; and the melancholy but inspiring &quot;Tomorrow.&quot; Each song shows us a little piece of Avril Lavigne, maybe because she has written all of them. Based on the whole &quot;Let Go&quot; CD and what each song has told me about her, Avril Lavigne is an awesome musician and an extremely deep and interesting person. And I hope she's single.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's real lyrics and guitar driven sound makes this cd a must have. 'Let Go' is one of the best cd's I've seen all year. You can relate to the true lyrics written by Avril herself. Also, the music is origional and anything but pop. If you like former girl rock artists like Alanis Morrisette and Fiona Apple, you will really enjoy Avril Lavigne's cd 'Let Go'.
B000056K04|1.0|In the world of sellout rock bands that were good like metallica and Pearl Jam, this is the next thing to cram after this awful cd, Poor plot, lowbrow production values and stereotypically boring scenes that might have been rip-off smash mouth than dave, my best advice for dave and the crew to stick to your guns, because this is not a good cd.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album &quot;Let Go&quot; presents a strong blend of individuality and creativity in music. This album is a MUST HAVE for any music lover.<br />Some songs found within this album are fast pace, well told, story like songs such as &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;. &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; is a fast pace, fun, well told story of a girl who rejected a guy because his style wasn't too well ranked with the rest of the girl's prep friends. Later on in life the girl finds that the boy, now a man, that she rejected is a rock star on MTV. This song passes a wonderful message onto its listeners, saying that its not good to judge a book by its cover, because you never know what this one person can be later on in life.<br />Other songs, are soft and well written with great musical backup and of course Avril's amazing vocal talents. &quot;I'm With You&quot; is another greatly favored track on this album for myself. This track, unlike the first hot single &quot;Complicated&quot; isn't based so much on guitars and drums to make its catchy beat, but moreover stringed instruments accompanied with the melodic backup of guitars.<br />Each track presents its on individuality among the others, proving Avril's claim to be herself, and individual, while being in the music industry to be true. <br />Overall I rate this cd 5 stars, it has great variety and individuality among others. This is Avril's debut album, and with the so far great success of this album and the greatness of its music qualities, I am looking well forward to seeing more from Avril in the future.
B00003CX6P|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what to think of \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" the first time I saw it.  So, not hating the movie and working solely on logic, I went back a week later and watched it again.  This is the type of movie that perpetually gets better.  It is a daring, beautiful film that is very unique for the Hollywood of today as is molds suspense, drama, beauty, and the strong essence of homosexuality into a rather disturbing, brilliantly provocative showcase.  There is nothing else like it, and the cast is absolutely fabulous.  Matt Damon is perfectly cast as Tom Ripley, and plays the part so convincingly that it's quite scary.  While watching Damon as Ripley, you're compelled to feel empathy for him despite what he does throughout the course of the movie.  He's touching, sincere, and hiding from who he really is, which I can completely understand.  Damon's performance here is one of the most Oscar-worthy I've seen yet.  Gwenyth Paltrow is also quite good in the role of Marge as she gradually takes an emotional fall throughout the film, taking the audience with her.  By the end of the film, there is nothing left of the bright, cheery Gwenyth we THOUGHT we knew.  There's only a shadow by the time \\"Ripley\\" is over, which proves that Paltrow has great talent to take that leap.  Absolutely superb!  Jude Law is perfectly - and I do mean PERFECTLY - cast as Dickie, Ripley's obsession.  Law has just the right bit of charisma and sensibility and, quite frankly, sexiness.  Why wouldn't Ripley be obsessing about him?  Cate Blanchett, who I love, also has a part here as a significant character that seems to parallel that of Marge's.  Blanchett is fantastic, as always, although I almost wish we could see more of her awesome ability in this film.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is also wonderfully cast as Dickie's pretentious and overprotective friend.  Hoffman eats up the role like no other actor could, and tends to steal every scene he's in just because of the sheer intensity of his character.  Also, the little-mentioned Jack Davenport has a small role here as well and he does quite well portraying one of Marge's friends and a potential lover of Ripley's.  It's a difficult role that plays significantly into the rest of the film and I have a high admiration for Davenport.  Now, with a cast like this that is so good, how is it possible to pass up \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\"?  The answer to that is simple - it's not!
B000066NW0|5.0|I had never heard of Avril before, just like some of you maybe? But when I heard her song for the first time about a month and a half ago.. I was shocked.. It was amazing! That encouraged me to buy the CD. When I first received the CD, I popped it into my CD player... I was tearing. The music was so brilliant... and it was just a thrill of a lifetime to listen to Avril Lavigne's CD. This CD deserves 50 stars! Avril's other song's are just so unique and they just have a new shine to it; unlike any other artist. Avril is surely one of a trillion, don't miss your chance and not buy the CD of the lifetime. You are stronly encouraged to buy Avril's &quot;Let Go&quot; by other listeners and myself; not because we are fans... but because we want this awesome talent(s) to be seen and heard by the world. <br />That woman has a lot of talent to bring to this world and she has just sparked a flame. Get ready... WORLD, Avril Lavigne is coming out and she is going to rock your world.
0062502174|4.0|A boy's journey from the fields of Spain to the sands of North Africa is the setting and protagonist of this pleasant fable by Coelho.  Yet the author takes a simple fairy tale and turns it into an inspirational story that opens a reader's eyes and mind to journeys that await us all.<br />This is the message predominant in Coelho's novel \\"The Alchemist\\", the sort of destiny waiting for us in his fable set in an ancient time along the shores of North Africa and the fields of old Spain.  Though the novel is in third person, it feels as if written for you and I.  It is riddled with morality, inspiration, and the hidden steps towards enlightenment. And all is confined in the parable of a boy set forth by destiny in search of his dreams.<br />The storytelling can feel a bit generic at times, a sort of homogenous setting that detracts from the spirituality of the story.  Yet Coelho still succeeds in presenting an enjoyable fable that reads like a historical novel (much like Gilan's \\"The Caravan\\"), but has a message for all who dream.
B000063S6Z|5.0|The new Moby album '18' has a pretty good chill and ambient feel. Most of the songs do have vocals though. While the early half of 'Play' had some rockin tracks, there isnt as many on '18' and when there are, they are not very noticeable. As a whole, this album does not take Moby to any new places, musically. But seems like a great extension of the feel of the songs at the end of Play and his ambient tracks. And it basically takes a few listens to it before you can really get into it. <br /> The songs that do rock out are &quot;Jam for the Ladies&quot; and &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; which feels like (fills about the same track number) as &quot;Machete&quot; from 'Play&quot;. Not to forget to mention the single &quot;We are all Made of Stars&quot;, while its very catchy musically, I tire of its vocals, but that could be because its on the radio a lot. <br /> My two favorite tracks after the first few listens are &quot;Signs of Love&quot; and &quot;Harbour&quot; which Sinead O'Connor lends vocals on. After a few more listens, &quot;The Rafters&quot; shines through in its excellence because of its power. It sounds like it could really blow the roof off. <br /> The song called &quot;Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)&quot; is interesting because the song uses some of the same<BR> chords that were used in &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad&quot; off 'Play'.<br /> &quot;Sleep Alone&quot; and &quot;At Least We Tried&quot; are lightly songs that are weepy with their minimal melodies and soft vocals. &quot;In this World&quot; has a part where it sounds like Moby just banged on the piano keys, and almost randomly, thats hard to hear on the first time. <br /> While my review was completely out of order and didnt touch on all the tracks, bottom line: Buy '18' if you like Moby, it'll grow on you. If you havnt heard Moby, start with 'Play' because it has a variety of styles and once you get into that, this album will follow along. Get this if you're someone looking for some chillsongs with a great groove. Moby's music has always been very relaxing.
B000066NW0|5.0|&quot;Let Go&quot; by Avril Lavigne is the best CD ever! She has such great songs. I think it's amazing that she wrote every one. I relate to each song in a different way and I think that's one of the main reasions why I love them so much. Avril is so real and she isn't afraid to be herself and I love that about her. I know that a lot of people feel the same because when I went to my local music store to buy the CD for a friend they were out of stock! I was so happy that so many see how great Avril is. Keep up the good work, Avril!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I purchased this album because the CBS Sunday Morning music review said it was a great CD and he was so so right!  A nice cross between The Cowboy Junkies, The Cranberries, Bonnie Raitt, and The Indigo Girls.  I have throughly enjoyed this album!
B00005A46T|5.0|I love IOWA! I like listening to a bunch of yelling and noise.  The band is also cool because they dress up in weird clothes.  My husband and I like to do that too.  The best part of the CD is that all the songs sound exactly the same in the middle.  They are all a bunch of loud overamped guitars with incoherent yelling.  I don't know what they are trying to sing about, but they sound angry.  Keep on yelling!
0871294273|2.0|I'm sorry for criticizing a \\"classic\\" and maybe I'm wrong but this had to be one of the most boring books that I have struggled through. I had to read this for school and I thought that this supposed \\"classic\\" would be not so bad. Riiiiight. <br /> I don't know if it has occured to anyone, but in this book, nothing really happens. At least nothing exciting. I don't know what the people who rave about the action are referring to. Okay, so Bilbo fights some big spiders. Ooooh. And it even skips the battle in the end because Bilbo is ironically knocked out by a rock. Perhaps that is for the better, though, for, if you've noticed, Tolkien stinks at doing anything fast paced. Every miniscule detail is drawn out into painful length. And when he tries to write suspense or action he is thrown off by their dumb speech style. Seriously, if you want someone to sound strong and mighty don't make them ever ever say the word \\"Alas\\". Ever. I will acknowledge that he adds some realism to the era by having them speak this way but does he have to write so boringly too?<br /> Tolkien also uses the annoying storytelling writing style where he actually refers to himself, the storyteller, and to the reader. He also shows everyone's thoughts and gives away parts of the story like when he refers to the Battle of Five Armies at the end of the book in the middle of the book. That takes away a lot of suspense.<BR> <BR>The dwarves. Are these supposed to be mighty warriors? Listen, mighty warriors don't stop to sing about everything that they happen to see or remember. And they never do anything on their own. They always mess things up and Bilbo has to save them, usually by some accident. And Bilbo. Maybe if he spent a little less time complaining about his hankerchief or about missing a meal he could do something exciting. <br /> Finally, there's Smaug, the almighty dragon who everyone fears. Maybe he would have been fearful if he didn't have long civilized conversations with people and reciteriddles. Yech.<br /> There, I've spoken against the almighty Tolkien books. I hope some dwarves don't come and sing me to death. I guess some people are into this kind of writing and liked these, but if your anything like me, stay away.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's CD is AWESOME!  It has a great mix of pop, rock, and punk.  It's one of those CD's you can just listen to.  There is no need to skip from one song to another, they are all great songs.  The lyrics are amazing and have such meaning behind them, you don't see that much anymore with new artists.  You see a wave of new artists and they are all the same but Avril is definatly different and fresh!
B000003TAR|5.0|I love this CD.  The entire CD is great.  I was reading the 1 star reviews, and I saw that 2 people spelled Cobain 'Kobain'.  Just figured id laugh at that a little bit.  But back to the CD.  This shows what a talented musical mind Kurt had, and that can be seen in a few songs.  'Dumb', for instance, has the guitar, drums, and bass blended beautifully.  Then you add the cello and you can see the 'Cobain Masterpiece'.  What i mean by this is that he was a musical and lyrical genius and no matter what anyone says, this CD has talent.  If youre too blind to see it, then fine.  But, please at least spell Cobain right.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is the most original and great artist ive seen in years. She has the most unique and powerfull voice. Shes not afraid to be different and doesnt feel the need to be another belly showing pop star. Hr music shows the different sides of her. Some Pop, Punk, Rock and some Mellow. My choice song is Losing Grip but her single Complicated is also Very Great! Infact the whole album rocks. She so wrote them all and sure does have talent! For a punker song check out Sk8er Boi which tells a story all in its self and for a rockin song check out Unwanted. Buy the album and you wont regret it!
B000066NW0|5.0|This is such a great CD! To hear such a voice and great lyrics from someone who's only 17 is mindblowing. Avril is extremely talented, and &quot;Let Go&quot; shows it. From the fun upbeat &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; to the slow and beautiful &quot;I'm With You&quot;, it's a CD with something for everyone! You're going to hear more from her in the next while, so you better buy this CD now!
B000066NW0|5.0|Well I would definantly say that this is the best CD that I have EVER purchased in the entire 15 years of my life! All of the songs have different meanings, yet what they all have in common is they have been actual experiences, not just stuff that she thinks will happen! I can't really explain how incredibly AWESOME AND TALENTED this girl is, don't ever ever compare her to another britney spears or whatever, she's completely different, THANK GOD! I know that a ton of other people all over have been waiting for an Artist like her! I know that Avril is completely down to earth, I know you can't possibly truly understand what I'm talking about until you BUY HER CD! Just do it!! :)
B000066NW0|5.0|`Let Go' is her debut CD, which is my favorite and the best I've ever heard,<BR>I can relate to all of it, every song, lyric and word.<BR>She writes from her heart and sings her own songs,<BR>She's original not fake and incredibly awesome, so don't get me wrong.<BR>Her and her songs are Anything But Ordinary but so sharp and new,<BR>I listen to them at school at home, and yes the shower too!<BR>Born in Canada, a small town, Napanee,<BR>She's 17 with straight, straight hair and pretty, I'm sure you can see.<br />She's my favorite singer, artist I'd rather say,<BR>I've never heard a CD like this, not until this day.<BR>I never put it down, it's always with me,<BR>I love to listen to her when she sings, and how she's open and free.<BR>I love her so much, she's the most amazing person I've ever heard and seen,<BR>In case you haven't realized, she has the best CD, and her name is Avril Lavigne!!!!
B00003CX95|5.0|I don't think that thier is a better movie ever made.  I live by this movie and mel Gibson did A good job as William Wallace.  I still cry every time I watch this movie and i've seen it more than any other person alive.  This, Pirates, and THe Simpsons are the three best things in life.  <BR>                        FREEDOM
B000068TP0|5.0|This dvd shows how amazing shakira really is. Her english cd is GOOD, but her songs en espanol are amazing. The lyrics are from the heart and her body movements are, well you'll have to see for yourself!
B00003CXXP|1.0|Thank goodness Mr. Kubrick was spared the pain of having to view this stinker. If you value your sanity avoid this at all costs.
B000002AH7|5.0|Miles Davis has been my favourite jazz artist ever since I first purchased Kind of Blue. I now own two of his less famous albums (&quot;Bag's Groove and &quot;Collector's Items&quot;), the &quot;Complete Birth of the Cool&quot;, the &quot;Complete Miles Davis/John Coltrane Columbia Recordings&quot;, &quot;The Complete Live At the Plugged Nickel 1965&quot; and &quot;The Complete In A Silent Way Sessions.&quot;<br />Looking for another box set to add to my collection, I had a listen to some of the tracks for both the Second Quintet's box set and the Miles/Gil Evans one. At first the idea of listening to the roots of fusion and the ultra free-sounding hard bop of the second quintet (I had liked what they did at the Plugged Nickel), I was pretty much set to purchase their box set instead of the more orchestral Gil Evans work. However, after listening to that AMAZING opening by Davis on &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot;, I had to have this album.<br />Not really jazz in the usual sense of the word, this album shows Miles doing what he became famous for; 'Fusing' ideas from outside jazz to create unique and wonderous works. This is one such album and is worth the listen. About on par with 'In A Silent Way', but still nothing compared to 'Kind of Blue'. Then again, no jazz album has ever been able to better that masterpiece!
6301008944|5.0|This is by far one of the best comedies of the 80s. It has everything. A great story, an awesome cast and lots of laughs and fun. For sure, this is Elisabeth Shue's best effort in a comedic role. If you need a good laugh, grab this movie. You'll be cheered up in no time. Enjoy.
0446677450|4.0|Thee book gave some ideas <br />Daniel Pimentel  Provo, UT<br />I have to say that this book gave me ideas and also that I can see another view of the money and how people see the money. An other thing that I like is that compares what he wants to say, with examples from real life. He tries to help people who are in deep financial problem. Also I took good things about this book, and applied them to me. I want to recommend this book to everybody and to take advantage of it.
B00005JL3A|4.0|First of all, I've never played the Resident Evil game. So I saw this movie as it is and not what is expected of it. All I can say is this movie kicks... The action is continous and hardly a minute came out boring. The acting ain't perfect but this is not an Oscar bound movie. But the most important thing is it's creepy & scary. All I can think of is what if I was inside the Hive. All these zombies, dogs, monsters coming out everywhere you turn. I can't wait for the DVD. If I can get a bootleg one I would. But I'm gonna be watching this movie over and over again.Especially late at night in the dark . Awesome!!!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Although I am a big fan of Japanese Animation, one doesn't have to be to enjoy Princess Mononoke (also known a Mononoke Hime). There is certainly a reason why this film is Japan's top grossing film ever, not just animated film, film period.<br />Mononoke has a fabulous story line, set in Fuedal Japan, this movie is primarily about the struggle between nature and man in an industrialising world. It doesn't limit itself to that though, another main theme is dealing with conflicts and hatred. I really respected the way that the characters were represented. Since I consider myself close to nature, I naturally felt more sympathy for San (who is the Princess Mononoke), and the forest gods. However, her enemy, Lady Eboshi, was by no means an evil character, and was very good to people, such as the lepers that she cared for. This emphisised that there is no firm line between good and evil, and theme that I always like to see in movies.<br />The animation of the characters, and especially the sceney was incredible. No animated movie has ever posessed such quality in my opinion, Disney and other american companies pale greatly in comparrison.<br />I have shown this movie to many of my friends, most all of whom are not fans of animated movies, and not one has thought it anythign but spectacular. This film is not only one of the greatest animated movies of all time, or one of the greatest foreign movies of all time, it is possibly the greatest film of any kind, ever.
0385335482|5.0|My friend let me borrow this book of hers because it's her favorite! Well, thanks to her it's mine too! I can totally relate to Becky Bloomwood about shopping, cept that I'm not in debt and she is a little overboard....lol! I love how no matter what obstacle there is, she will always find a way to shop! She's run into soo many things and when she least expects it, she gets what she wants! She lacks off on her job and has no clue how to do it but when she takes time off, she understands everything! I think everyone should read this book, cause I can't even tell you what a great book it is!! I can't wait to read the sequel, Shopaholic Takes Manhattan...It's the next book on my reading list and this time shes coming to my town!
0151003084|5.0|The Gashlycrumb Tinies is a delightful little book with horridly wonderful illustrations, and a neat little rhyming alphebet poem that will amuse you in spite of yourself, as long as you like twisted humor that is. It's a sturdy little hardcover book, I loved the cover illustration.<br />The book IS very little, as an alphebet book it only contains 26 real pages (the listing is higher because every-other page is blank), so while it is a fun book, it is very short lived. I consider it worth it anyway, but I thought that the prospective buyer might like to be warned.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Jonh Williams made the music fit the book perfet. It's like you are there. The music just lightens up my day ,in fact it will put you to sleep.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Ususally when I buy a CD there are only 2 or 3 good songs on the album, and the rest aren't worth listening to. But Morning View is totally different. Every song is unique in its own way.  Most alternative rock bands out there today have no problem playing a good song, but the lyrics just aren't there.  The deep spiritual lyrics matched with Brandon Boyd's voice really round out the album.  I love the way they can move from &quot;harder&quot; songs, like Nice to Know You, Circles, and Have You Ever, to the more mellow 11 a.m., Are You In, Echo, Aqueous Transmission, and even the beautiful acoustic Mexico.  This album is a great buy and I promise it will never leave your CD player!
B000066NW0|5.0|This Cd is great! It is full of powerful songs that everyone that listens to it can relate to. Avril shows that she is a normal person with the same things going on in her life just like everyone else.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is they best artist to emerge in a while. All that comes out of her mouth is truth. She speaks of relationships, heatbreak and getting over it all. I admire her for becoming something she wanted to be, at such a young age. She has inspired me to do what i want in life and to not look back.<BR>This cd is the best you'll ever own. My friends seem to agree :)
B000066NW0|5.0|From the first time I heard Complicated and saw the video, I knew Avril was anthing but ordianry! I got the CD the day after it came out and went straight home to listen to it and I was amazed! She is a ROLE MODEL to me! Her words really touched me and I can relate to at least one thing in every song! I cant go afew hours without wanting to listen to it and I always have her songs in my head! Like Tomorrow, Anything but Ordinary, My World, Nobody's Fool, Things I'll Never Say, and Naked, they are all wonderfull songs and each have their own wonderfull meanings!  I mean give any regular 17 year old a guitar and some paper and you would most likely get nothing but give all that to Avril and you get an amazing work of art! And that is exactly what her CD is! She is the most talented thing to come out of Canada. In my opinion, well no IM TELLING everyone to give this girl a chance! She's a wonderful songwriter and performer and I bet even a better friend and person! She is awesome and if you listen to her Cd and listen to the words you will totally get to know her and grow to love her work, which I already have and can't wait to see her in a live performance sometime here in Utah! SO everyone Give Avril a chance and listen to what she has to say and sing!
B00005QDW1|3.0|Note that this album contains songs, similar to the songs from Eminem's new album, that are somehow copy protected on the CD, which means that the MP3's you download are just repetitions of the same 15 or 20 second portion, so please don't judge the album unless you have really listened to the actual CD.
B000066NW0|5.0|I noticed I cant rate her cd higher than 5 but I am rating it as a 10!  I first found out about Avril about 2 months ago, and fell in love the first time I heard it!  Shes a gifted young woman and proves she has AMAZING! talent!!  I HIGHLY recommend this CD!  There isn't one song I dont like!!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|This album is amazing. Avril Lavigne is one of the most talented artist that I have heard in a while. She is one of a string o talented singer/songwriters coming out right now, but she is slightly different from the rest of them; she has attitude. I originally bought this album because it was [inexpensive], but when I actually listened to the CD, I realized that I got my money's worth; it's worth much more than that. Her voice is up there with Alanis Morissette and Natalie Merchant, with the hipness of Michelle Branch, Fiona Apple, and a young Sheryl Crow. Each track on this album is completely different from each other, so you get to taste the range of talent this young woman has. She can range from a popish sound, to an alternative sound, all the way to a hard rock sound; this album has music for everyone. I suggest that everyone should buy this album, or at least give it a chance.
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is the BOMB people!!..I have never found a cd in my life that i liked every song on it..I absolutly love every, and i mean every,song on this cd...I first heard about Avril when some friends told me that she lived in Napanee.I thought that was very cool and decided to check out some of her music on the web.Her cd is very well layed out and she blew me away with all the songs.It goes from soft to rock and it does it very well.She is true to her music and she writes about real things..I have even got my boyfriend to like her music now since i listen to it so much..Avril You Rawk.!!. I'd love to see some more of this awesome music in the future from her.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's first CD &quot;Let Go&quot; is amazing.She writes incredible and meaningful lyrics which anyone can relate to.<BR>Her video for Complicated is awesome! As soon as I got the cd I popped it into my cd player and was immediately singing along!<BR>If you have AOL, go to keyword &quot;Avril&quot; and watch the Sessions@AOL. You get to see her perform songs on &quot;Let Go.&quot; If you like Alanis Morissette you will most definitely like Avril!
B000066NW0|5.0|I never listen to american or canadian music usually . Occidentals are too predictable . I've been quite surprised to discover a canadian gurl could make music I wanted to listen to . &quot;Let go&quot; is an album for people like me who've lost interest in &quot;american teen sensationalism&quot; . Avril is a complete artist, with diversified vocals and highly original touch . It doesn't sound like anything I've heard so far, and songs such as &quot;Complicated&quot;, &quot;Losing grip&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot; really had me speechless .
B000066NW0|5.0|An amazing CD to say the least. Napanee, Ontario artist Avril Lavigne has definately shown her stuff with this CD. From her more up-beat hard songs like Unwanted, to her softer songs like &quot;I'm With You&quot; Avril proves that small town singers can make it big. The best part of it all has to be that she had a hand in writing every single one of her songs, something you don't see from a lot of artists out there. The CD is very easy to relate to and has a very realistic point of view because of her participation in it. A buy worthy CD indeed.
B000000H6D|5.0|Awesome album, I remember the first time I heard Black No. 1. It gave me chills, i'm still searching for a chick like that. Anyway I met Pete Steele this past Friday in a bar in NYC. It was my birthday and mutual friend introduced us. He was a really cool guy, a little weird but most geniuses are. Anyway buy this album and experience one of the great underrated bands of the 90's.
B000066NW0|5.0|The album Let's Go, by new comer Avril Lavigne is one of the best new albums to be let out this summer. Her single complicated isnt not even an example of how good her album is. The song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;I'm with You&quot; are examples of how much of a talented writer this 17 year old is. The songs speak to the listener.. &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; and &quot;My World&quot; are the funky songs that also hold some meaning. This album is wonderful.. Its one of those albums that teenagers can look to and listen to and know that there is someone other then them out there that has the same problems as they do..
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd rocks! It's a mix of pop and a bit of punk rock. Avril does an excellent job at putting her image and voice out there. It's awsome. Everyone's cd collection should have her new cd, &quot;LET GO&quot;.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne has recently become one of my favorite artists.  Her album, &quot;Let Go&quot; is a CD that doesn't require a stop/skip button.  All the tracks are simply amazing and it's a definite plus that she writes her own music.  It'll blow anyone away!  She truly has talent, persistence, and unique style.<br />She's not your next Britney, according to her, and in my own words, she's one of a kind.  She's not expressing herself to hover in another artist's shadow.<br />The thirteen tracks featured on her break-through CD are wonderful and appear to have an appealing sense of grunge.  The great thing about her music, is that you can relate to what she's singing about and it's a CD that gives you the confidence that you can listen and understand.  &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; surely expresses the nervousness of telling things to one another in a relationship.  &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, my personal favorite, is upbeat and features sounds from guitars and drums and is worth of head-bobbing and air guitar.<br />I truly reccommend this to those few who need to buy an awesome CD that they'll never throw away.  This puppy isn't coming out of my CD player!
B000066NW0|5.0|I wasn't sure if I liked Avril Lavigne's style, until I bought the CD. Not only is her voice mesmerizing, but her lyrics are really relatable. She doesn't preach to you about things no one cares about, she just sings what she knows. Avril's style is a refreshing break from traditional pop, and all out there rock. She mixes them together, and surprisingly they blend well. If your not sure if your into Avril Lavigne, trust me you won't be disappointed. buy the CD today!
B00003CXI1|5.0|First off, if you have a DVD player, then you *must* get this movie. This is by far the best DVD I've ever, and will ever, see. Hands down. This is loaded, I mean, loaded with extras. You can have a 3D tour of Hogwards, Hagrid's home, and you get to cast spells, and much, much more. One of the best things about this disk is that if you want to see the 7 deleted scenes, you have to work for them. You have to find some keys, get your money, get your wand, go to school, and do spells. If you do all of this correctly, you get the honor of seeing the extra scenes.<br />Besdies this being a outstanding DVD, this is a wonderful movie! Join Harry as he learns on his 11th birthday that he's a wizard. \\"Yer a wizard Harry\\". Harry's life is changed for the better when he goes to Hogwarts to learn magic. The Special effects are impressive. The Quidditch match is worth the pice of the DVD. I highly suggest you get this movie.<br />I'm a big fan of this books. I have just 3 small complaints. And I mean these are small. I'd like to have seen the Weasley twins used more. They were so funny in the book. I also thought that Snape should have been a bit meaner, like he was in the book. In the book, Herimonie used logic in one scene, not magic.<br />I highly suggest that you get this moive. If you do, I promise you won't be sorry.
6305910189|5.0|Movie Review:<br />After all these years, this is still the strongest of the Trek movies.  A solid story, a strong villain, and the return of that &quot;Trekish&quot; atmosphere between the regulars that was so absent in the first film.  Underneath it all, the theme of age is woven, not as an overall driving force but as a texture.<br />The effects look OK; they've aged about as well as most early 80's SF effects have.  The action sequences are good and never run too long, and the subplots fit in well.  The movie is tight and does not feel too long, unlike the first which could stand to lose 45 minutes or so.  And I suppose I am the only one who likes the James Horner music, but I think it fits PERFECTLY.<br />Even though Shatner and Montalbon drift over the top at times, we don't care because by then we're wrapped up in the adventure.  That the drama of the ending -- which was very well done -- is undone by the next movie is not this movie's fault.  This movie is better standalone than paired with its weak successor, and the originator of the even-numbered-good odd-numbered-bad rule of Trek films that persists to this day.  Definitely a winner.<br />DVD Review:<br />It's horrible.  A lousy transfer, and no extras at all beyond a cruddy trailer.  There's a new &quot;Director's Edition&quot; coming out soon, and it should be better.  Hold out for that.
B00005A0RI|5.0|...that hasn't already been said. As an eclectic and demanding listener rarely do I feel strongly enough to praise a CD. The recording quality is lush, the music is exceptional. Few notes are wasted, everything fits. It's mellow for sure, but isn't this what we're looking for in music, something to relax by? Brushes on drum skins often sound like tape hiss on most recordings but even they work on this CD. And I love the way the bass is not wasted by being obscured in the background. The musicians are devoted to making beautiful music and they succeed like I've rarely heard.

B000066NW0|5.0|Who ever thought this was possible? But Avril Lavigne has explored the crevices of skater punk and created a new sound. Her melodious voice and heavy guitar riffs/rhythms intertwine and creates something more than music.  Her lyrics are powerful and meaningful.  I totally recommend her cd.  She's so rad!
B000065U1N|5.0|Somalia,Mogadishu 1993, Mohammed Ferrah Adid uses starvation <BR>to kill 300,000 Somaili's his Lt.'s have orders from Adid to stop<BR>any U.N. food shipments from coming into the country which makes<BR>famine on nothing more than a biblical scale.In October 4 , 1993<BR>U.S. orders are to go into Mogadishu and caputure Adid and his <BR>top Lt's a mission that would take no longer then 45 minutes at <BR>the most black hawk helicopters would carry them to the site.<br />   A team of Delta Force and Rangers would be on the mission <BR>they get the code for the mission Irene.When they touch down<BR>they endure heavey fire almost instantly.Having one casuilty<BR>and one injury they get their target but suddenly a Black <BR>Hawk Helicopter is shot down by the somalian malitia from an<BR>R.P.G. now the mission turns from an excursion to an actual <BR>battle the Delta Force and Rangers outnumberd and taking <BR>heavy casuilteys the soliders must now defend the crash site<BR>at all costs.With convoy lost and taking heavy casuilteys<BR>yet another Black Hawk helicopter goes down.It look's very <BR>heartbreaking for the U.S. team all the while our soldiers <BR>are dying or getting wounded at every corner and at one time <BR>fighting off the entire city.<br />   Meanwhile while the politicans in Washington sit on there <BR>butts uninformed about what's happening not even bringing Nato <BR>in the picture.In one scene ill equipped with medical suppiles<BR>two soldiers must perform surgery on a terribly wounded soldier<BR>by reparing his artery with no morphine these are the horrific <BR>and brutal things that are own U.S. soldiers had to experience<BR>in Mogadishu.Nato who finally comes into to escort the soliders <BR>to Pakistan Stadium but not while leaving some soldiers to run<BR>an entire mile underfire to the stadium.<br />    In the end Clinton orderd all U.S. Troops out of Somalia in <BR>a heartwrenching defeat for the U.S.,19 U.S. soldiers would make <BR>the ultimate sacrifice for their country and would show that we <BR>are vulnirable just because we are Americans does not mean we <BR>can't loose a war.And we ask ourselves why , why do these young <BR>men put themselves so easily into war , we can see what it was like in this in this film and in documentaries in this movie <BR>industry of ours that's really all hollywood can do is show us<BR>what the war looks like , but one thing hollywood can't do is <BR>show us what war is like or what it feels like unless you have been in one there is just no way you will know.Even now down in <BR>Afganistan as U.S. soldiers are fighting the war on terror and<BR>making the ultimate sacrifice is that love for our country that<BR>no enimey can take away from us and every U.S. soldier takes <BR>an oath to defend that is what we should be thankful for.<br />  Ridley Scott captures this war perfectly even though it is a <BR>bare bones DVD it is worth picking it up because it is worth <BR>looking into and while it is no Saving Private Ryan it is a very <BR>good and patriotic film.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I was hearing all this talk about how powerful a movie American beauty was. I thought that it was just about an middle aged man lusting after a high school cheerleader and I said to myself \\"how griping of a movie can it be if thats the main plot\\" and I wrote it [off] ... but then the day came and I talked myself into renting it. well, lets just say that I rented it, watched it four times, rentured it, then walked right in to the store and bought myself a copy. It has been a long time sence a movie or anything else for that matter has touched me as deeply as American beauty did. Its not a movie about A middle aged man lusting after a high school cheerleader its a movie about how we are all surounded by bueaty every day and we forget to realize it. I felt that the movie was a big wake up call for us all to stop go out side ourselfs and see our lifes and and what we can do to make them better. instead of just looking at the sunset. stop and marvel at the pure bueaty of it. \\"you have no idea what I'm talking about I'm sure. but don't worry, you will someday\\"
B000009EUM|3.0|&quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; was a-ha's patchy follow-up effort to &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot;.<br />The band - to their credit - was exploring new sounds and styles within themselves and the pop genre.  The results come off a bit raw and unpolished in places; successful in others.<br />The title track is its tour-de-force, and &quot;I've been losing you&quot; is arguably a-ha's strongest song.  But the rest of the album tries to be too serious for my tastes or feels clunky production wise.  &quot;Manhattan Skyline&quot; overreaches the extremes of Morten's emotions and hits a melodramatic note, rather than a genuine high.  &quot;Cry Wolf&quot; is a well-driven pop track - and is fuller than the other songs which feel somewhat piecemeal and incomplete.<br />Nonetheless the incendiary moments of &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; and &quot;I've Been Losing You&quot; certainly showcase the band's potential abilities to move into a harder direction - something they've yet to do in later albums.  In that sense, these tracks are worth the price of this CD.<br />Scoundrel Days is a transitional album.  The band tries to be bold but hits some obstacles.  Morten's voice - maturing from &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; - explores a different range here - sometimes with success, sometimes falling into awkwardness - like he's walking over a trapeze.<br />I'm sorry I can't agree with the other a-ha fans here, but this was simply not a-ha's best for me.
B00005YJMX|5.0|...I was fortunate enough to get an early copy from [another location]. The picture and sound quality on this dvd are much better than Anchor Bay's previous release (which was poor). For that reason, this edition is the one to buy. Other than that, I believe the special features are the same.<br />The 4-page collector's booklet ... is nothing to get excited about. It just shows the cover art for both the German and English releases of this movie, and has the scene selection index on the back. The 13-minute featurette \\"The Making of Nosferatu\\" is also no big deal. There are one or two nice shots of actor Klaus Kinski (who plays Dracula) putting on the finishing touches of his makeup, and some shots of director Werner Herzog instructing his actors, but other than that you don't get to see much of interest, and they don't really talk much about the movie itself, and how it was made. There are four trailers; one on disc 1 and three on disc 2. One of the trailers on disc 2 is the same as the one on disc 1, but they are all nice to look at. The talent bios are actually interesting to read; I found it really fascinating that, for one of his movies, Herzog actually hypnotized his actors!<br />If you do not already own \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\", it is right up there with \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" and the original 1922 \\"Nosferatu\\" as one of the three best Dracula adaptations I have ever seen. The music is honey to the ear and each frame of this movie looks like a painting. The story loosely follows the book (the characters Lucy and Mina are switched around, Renfield is Jonathan Harker's employer, the vampire carries the plague with him everywhere he goes, and there is a different ending), but the movie gets the FEEL down perfectly. Dracula is more fleshed out than he was in the book. He is a creature of the night, but he is also very sad. This Dracula is immortal, but he does not have eternal youth; his body grows more sickly as he ages. This Dracula wants to die, because he cannot live without physical and spiritual love.<br />If you DO own an older copy of this movie on vhs or dvd, I recommend you buy this movie anyway because, ... it has a much better picture than the previous dvd release.
B000002L7Y|4.0|...there was a-ha.  For a moment in time, this trio ruled the airwaves and were the hottest band around. &quot;Take on Me&quot; was a defining single and video.<br />In &quot;Hunting High and Low&quot; - one uncovers a-ha's distinctive style.  More than straightforward pop-meisters, a-ha wrote and executed some interesting tracks in their debut album. Morten Harket's pristine, sweeping vocals are the highlight of each song.  The album veers between bright pop synth ballads (&quot;Blue Sky&quot;; &quot;Love is Reason&quot;) to progressive whimsical love songs (&quot;Living A Boy's Adventure Tale&quot;).  The band's matinee idol looks didn't hurt either and greatly enhanced their success.<br />Given their appeal to teens, the image aspect of a-ha did sometimes overshadow their inventiveness as musicians (this was the era where pop bands could play and compose their own music as with predecessors Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, Depeche Mode etc), and much of a-ha's later music tried to find new ground - moving away from the bright pop landscape they create in this album, but somehow never quite recapturing the youthful charm.<br />But the best way to describe this album is: endearing. It's refreshing to hear the guys play with a sense of spontaneous abandon.  Compared to today's over-produced boy bands who love covers and lack a distinctive sound - a-ha has held their own.  There are some pop gems in here and hats off to Morten, Mags and Pal for pulling it off with oomph.
B000066NW0|5.0|If you haven't all ready hear Avril's first single, then you must be on an island in a far off land. This artist has one amazing voice that will shock you through every song. Avril's CD is made up with so many differences and styles it wouldn't be right to classify her in only one group. You know how you sometimes you might like to listen to pop, rock, rap, or any other genre of music. And you can't figure out what genre you like the most and you became confused. This girl right here will break the walls of the genres. And I would highly suggust you buy Avril's CD, I promise once you hear her CD you will never want to put it down. If your one of those people that only listen to artists who write their own music and lyrics, here's a sk8er punk chick who writes what she feels into her music. That is why her singing has so much emotion in it. Ok to sum up Avril Lavigne's CD is one you really want to add to your CD collection, and it doesn't matter what genre of music you listen to. Her name might be &quot;Complicated&quot; to pronoun but it's easy to interput her music.
B000066NW0|5.0|i think Avril Lavigne is THE best punk girl out there in the muzik biz. she reeli understands what punk is about, and she's out there to share it with the world. And they are listening. Everyone is interested in her, in her music, her life, in her. She is incredibly beautiful, and doesn't give in to stereotypes, or take notice to any judgements. She's just out there having fun and being herself, and isn't that what music should b about? This cd is the best cd I've ever listened to, and you won't regret doing the same.
B000066NW0|5.0|this new artist cd (avril lavigne &quot;let go&quot;) is a great sucess for this young canadian artist (signer,song writter,skater-punk,guitar player and so  much more..the cd is really good the songs have a tendencie of reflecting real life ..the songs are good starting from the very first one to the last one 13..there's only one thing I can say  congradulation Avril you rock keep on rollin youll get far..let your dreams live..
B000066NW0|5.0|i think this cd is one of the best cds i have listened to in a while. Avril Lavigne is coming out strong for punk, and I love her to death. She is amazingly strong for such a young person, and her music is so lively! I think this is one of the best cds u'll ever pick, and believe me, u wont regret it
B000066NW0|5.0|It's about time someone made a cd where every song is good and not just the first released. Avril Lavigne's new cd 'Let Go' is positively one of the best cd's I have ever bought. If it were a tape, I would've worn it out already, cuz I swear I play the cd about 15 times a day beginning to end. Every single song has a great message and makes you wanna get up and sing. It's a great cd, and the fact that Avril is just 17 (like myself) is even more amazing. Do I sound obsessed? That's cuz I am! Avril has loads of talent and I hope that everyone else gives her a chance as well. If you don't have the cd, go out and buy it, it won't be a waste of your money.<BR>~Avril's #1 fan: Holly~
B000066NW0|5.0|'Let Go' is a truly unique and refreshing compact disc from newcomer Avril Lavigne. At just 17, this Canadian wrote all 12 songs on the album and plays the guitar on her tracks. <BR>From the mellowed-out medley's like 'Naked' and 'I'm With You' to the headbanging jams such as 'Losing Grip' and 'Unwanted' this cd's a sure-fire crowd pleaser, head to toe! Congrats, Avril!

THERE ARE NO OTHER WORDS ! HER SONGS ARE CATCHI AND CERTAINLY NOT BORING !!!<BR>YOU CAN FEEL THAT WHEN SHE SINGS SHE'S NOT ONLY EXPRESSING HERSELF AND TELLING STORIES , SHE'S ALSO HAVING FUN ! A CONTAGIOUS FUN...THAT , I THINK , EVERY TEENAGE PUNK-SKATER WOULD HAVE JUST BY LISTENING TO HER. RELATE TO HER SONGS IS ALSO VERY EASY...PUNK-SKATERS ARE, AFTER ALL .... IN THE SAME CRAZY WORLD.<BR>FORTUNATLY SHE SINGS TRYING TO TOUCH EVERY KIND OF PERSONS,NOT ONLY SKATERS-PUNK,RIGHT ? AND I THINK SHE SUCCEED IT ! <BR>CONTAGIOUS FUN + ENERGY + OUT OF THE ODENARY = AVRIL LAVIGNE AND HER GREAT CD : LET GO !!!
B000002ACR|5.0|This truly is a classic Byrds album with Chris Hillman pulling a vast majority of song writing duties here.<BR>Not only does he extend himself more on this album, but his songs are among the best it has to offer.  &quot;Thoughts and Words&quot; will always be one of my favorite tunes, with a moody, Los Angeles type of feel (that still holds up well today.)<BR>&quot;Have you Seen Her Face&quot; is another great Hillman track with fantastic lyrics and McGuinn guitar.  &quot;Time Between&quot; has a kind of Desert Rose Band (Chris Hillman's future/most recent band), 'Sweetheart of the Rodeo' country-rock feel.<BR>&quot;The Girl With No Name&quot;, yet another great Hillman song about a failed relationship has Clarence White (future Byrds guitarist) as guest on it.<br />To me though, the bonus tracks shine here, as &quot;It Happens Each Day&quot; (Crosby) and &quot;Lady Friend&quot; (Crosby) turn out to be two of my favorite tracks.<BR>I used to listen to this album with headphones on top of the apartment building I lived in off Sunset Blvd.  (That's Los Angeles for people who have no idea what I'm talking about).  Being from Los Angeles, I could feel the atmosphere looking over the city and listening to classic Byrd songs.  Amazing.<br />One last thing,&quot;Mind Gardens&quot; in my view is just terrible.  If this was any other band, I'd consider taking it down a star just for this song.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This movie actually surprised me.  I have not been a fan of the Harry Potter series.  I haven't read the books at all, and quite frankly I don't really understand the hype about the books.  However, I thought that the movie was well made.  <br />From reading the reviews, it sounds like a number of people are dissapointed in the movie and prefer the books.  However, no movie (not even Lord of the Rings, fellow reviewers) that is based on a book will ever follow the book exactly.  <br />I think that if you buy this movie, you will not be disappointed.  It's fun to watch, and now I may even want to read the books.<br />Enjoy!
B000066NW0|5.0|&quot;Let Go&quot; has got to be the best cd there is. It's inspiring ballads and rocking-good tunes keep me singing for hours! i recommend this album to anyone- since avril can definately appeal to anyone from pop to punk!
6305750750|4.0|If you're buying this video box set instead of the DVD, you must be a star wars collector.  Don't get me wrong, I like the movie. But the extras that are included with the VHS box set just do not warrant a 30$ price tag.  <br />Do yourself a favor and buy the DVD instead.  You'll save 10$, and overall I think you'll be happier.  I know I am!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is sure something diffrent. Never have I heard such a voice. I think this  album is going to hit the billboards. I really enjoyed her album \\"Let Go\\", its so outthere. \\"Complicated is one of my favorite songs. I like the way she brings out her self, her true self in her music. Avril is not being fake she tells it how it is. And I like that in an artist. There is hardly any artist that come straight forward and tell it how it really is. Hope her album is as good or better than this one. I really got hooked on her music, her lyrics especially.  Avril is a good writter. I wish  her and the  band the  best of success.
B00003CXI1|4.0|A wonderful adaptation from the book to the movie by Chris Columbus. If you have read the books this is a most see movies and if you haven't read any of the books this will be a wonderful start for your collection. Wonderfull use of cgi and never seen before images in a two disc set. You have and interactive disc with games. And a perfect gift for your son or niece if they are into the whole Harry Potter books.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This CD...words just dont describe how much i love it.I feel like Pink is singing my life story. In every song there is words that describe how i feel in my life right now. Everyone will have some connection with this cd no matter where you are in life. BUY IT!!!!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Levigne's debut cd is awesome. It is so much more than just a typical teenage teeny-bopper cd. Avril sings about real things, real feelings, and like she proudly states in one of her songs , she is \\" for real.\\"<BR> This cd is the best cd that i have gotten in along time. Everyone should buy this cd because it is great! And if you think \\"complicated\\" is a cool song, wait till you hear all the other 12 songs. They are even better!!! Avril is no doubt, a one of a kind artist!
B000066NW0|5.0|i'ts not very often you find a cd where every song rocks, but all the songs on Let Go are awesome.  Avril's style is really cool, and, unlike a lot of other artists, she has character.  some of her songs (&quot;Anything But Ordinary,&quot; &quot;In My World,&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;) really make it obvious that you're only going to get who she is.  It's great the way she puts feeling into her songs and everything comes from her heart.  The cd also includes  the &quot;Complicated&quot; music video, and it's really fun to watch because it shows her personality and she looks like she's a lot of fun to be around.  this is a great cd and i HIGHLY suggest you buy it.  you won't regret it!!  the whole cd rocks.
B000066NW0|5.0|I finally got her CD andit RULES!!!  If you don't buy it your either cheap, an idiot, or someone who clicked on the wrong link and shuld buy this anyway.  The only time this CD has left my cd player is when I've been in the car and traveling, or in an aircraft where I'm listening to the radio and (unfortunatly) not her CD.  Aside from those two times it's been in a stereo or diskman on repeat.<br />Translation: BUY THIS!<br />PS 5 outta 5 don't do it justice, more like 10 outta 5
B00005YW4H|5.0|I want a copy in every CD player I own because I find myself carrying it around with me all the time!   Sometimes I have to listen to a CD once or twice before I decide if I like it -- by the middle of the 3rd song, I KNEW &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is destined to be on my top favorites for a long time to come!  Mix a little bit of Bonnie Raitt with a touch of Macy Gray for one song... then a little Joni Mitchell swirled in for another... just FRESH and FANTASTIC -- I can't say enough good things about this album.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I've read several reviews here that made me laugh.  People who take every lyric literally should not buy this album.  If you buy the album solely to hear \\"Get the Party Started\\" you may be disappointed.  This is not a Britney/Nsync catchy pop album to choreograph dance routines to!  It is, however, an indepth look into the soul of an artist that isn't afraid to be herself.  Pink takes the road less traveled with this album. Unlike \\"Get the Party Started, most of the songs are deeply introspective.  \\"Just Like A Pill\\", one of my faves on the album, is lyrically outstanding and one of the best songs I've heard in a long time. ... Although Pink attempts to express herself in Missundaztood, she is not vulgar or crude.  Other ultrahighlights(since the entire album is a highlight) include the anti-conformist \\"Don't let me get me\\", \\"Family Portrait\\",and the Steven Tyler-Pink duet \\"Misery\\".  Although I loved Pink's last album, I would have to say that this is a step forward for her.  I recommend picking up a copy of Missundaztood. It is light years away from the ... manufactured pop albums released in the past few years.
1878424114|5.0|I am a Believer in Christ as the Son of God.  So from this perspective the book was wonderful and enlightening.  Applicable to your immediate state of mind and cirmstance, with plenty of information for further insight.  Practical, and straight forward.  I highlighted ideas I wanted to develop, made a few personal notes (not needed), and am going to use this as a handbook that I refer to once a month.  In the future it will be used as a refrence book.
B00006690H|5.0|I like Eminem when he's not cussing, 'cause I'm a Christian and I hate cussing.  I like Eminem, he's got a great beat, especially on this album!!!  All the classics on the cd are awesome!!!!  Go out and get it.  \\"Without Me\\" is a great song except for when he talks about Chris Kirkpatrick because my favorite group is 'NSYNC, but don't miss this great cd!!  You'll love it!!
B000066NW0|5.0|This album is by far the most unique album i have ever heard.  Avril is very down to earth about her music and thats what makes her music so good.  she just sings about whats on her mind and doesnt care about what people think, where most other musicians are afraid of how the public will respond to their music. everyone should buy and listen to this album, because i'm sure you will be able to relate to what she's saying.
B000066NW0|5.0|Roll out the red carpet because here comes the latest hit. Avril Lavgine's \\"Let Go\\" is the greatest album yet. Everytime I here Complicated on the radio, I jump up and turn it loud. I usually listen to rock and heavy metal music, but this girl, does she have a voice or what! She's my new idol. Ever since I got the CD, I've been listening to it non-stop.What can I say... Im addicted to it. She's my #1 favorite artist yet of all time. Her songs relate to everyday problems and situations. I listen to her music when I'm feeling down, happy, mad, or in anymood.This young lady is so talented that she wrote the songs on the album \\"Let Go\\". My mother never likes to hear the  music I play, but when I played Avril's \\"Let Go\\" album she turned it up and asked me who she was. Her music is suitable for kids, teens, and adults. So please go out and buy Avril Lavigne's new cd \\"Let Go\\" and hear the beauty.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-man is great. Great visual effects, just as fast (or rather slow) as the matrix. It has it all-great characters, great plot, great special effects and of coarse great sound editing! It is almost exactly like the comics/tv cartoons! Probably one of the only differences are that... I'll let you know after you watch it (don't want to spoil it). This movie is worth watching! It's worth the wait that all Spider man fans have been waiting for. It's a film that's appealing to children, teenagers, and adults! I haven't met anyone who hates it! It has both romance and humor! Dunst and Maguire are perfect for the role! It's a movie that let's you know how wide an imagination of a director can be. It's a touching story and at the same time a fast action movie that you wouldn't mind watching over and over again! In a way it's like the comic book coming alive! It's for all Lord of the rings-Harry Potter-The matrix- and Batman fans!        It's basically concentrates on Peter Parker-a guy who's in love with Mary Jane. It's a kind of movie that Alanis Morissette songs would really go with since she has songs to support all the moods that you'd feel as you watch Spider-Man (and hey she has a song called Mary Jane!).        Overall it was really worth the wait. It's better than any movie I've watched all summer! The movie packs together a lot of excitement. Just like Lord of the rings it's touching and at the same time exciting (I know I've mentioned this before!). No one could have made it any better than Raimi (although I'd like to watch a movie directed by Peter Jackson and Raimi). Spider-man is no old super hero movie (although it does have a damsel who is constantly in distress)-it's a modernized fast creation that could only be imagined as you read the comic books-until now! It's a spectacular flick that you should watch if you haven't watched it yet! It's a movie that very rarely bores you. It doesn't stretch a scene by giving you too much detail. It's really worth watching on the big screen!
B000002WPI|5.0|This is when hip hop was hip hop, and not the watered down [junk] it is today. This is hot from top to bottom,and all 8 Mc's from Method Man to the GZA come crazy correct on the album....
0064400557|5.0|This is a book which should have ten stars, not just five. <br />   Faced with the impending slaughter of Wilbur, the runt piglet she has saved and nursed to health, Fern is appalled that she has fattened him for the axe, and commits herself passionately to save her beloved animal. So, too, is Charlotte, the spider who inhabits the barn with him, and woh turns her web into a sort of billboard/oracle which astonishes (and admonishes) the community by weaving words that inform them that this is no ordinary pig! She recruits Templeton the Rat and the rest of the animals in her battle for Wilbur's life...will they succeed? or will Wilbur be a nine-days' wonder? and what will be the ultimate cost?<br />   This is the best present I can imagine to inspire a young reader; it's a wonderful tale of courage against the odds; it's warm, sad, and delightfully funny, and 30 years after I read it in fourth grade, I still get a lump in my throat thinking about it. A special, special book. (With wonderful original illustrations!)
B00006690G|5.0|As witty as \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" was, \\"The Eminem Show\\" seems to be even wittier.  This time, Eminem concentrates less on pushing buttons, and more on social and personal commentary.<br />Curtains Up(skit) - Just some sound effects giving the impression of Em walking up to a microphone.<br />White America - A heavy sounding song about how Eminem has unwittingly reached so many people in so many different ways.  He points out how he wouldn't be targeted so much if he was black.<br />Business - Dre's G-funk production is easily recognizable here, and is just as groovy as ever.  Em plays the role of Robin to Dre's Batman, much like the current video for \\"Without Me\\".<br />Cleaning Out My Closet - Self explanatory title.  Here, Em once again vents his thoughts on his fame, ex-wife, and mother, but manages to say enough new stuff to keep from sounding repetative.<br />Square Dance - Don't let the title fool you, its still a rap song.  Em says this song overall is intended to help you forget stuff and let loose.  A few pot shots at Cannabis pop up here.<br />The Kiss(skit) - A loose recreation of the events that led to Eminem's arrest.<br />Soldier - With all the negative press, lawsuits, and newfound fame coming at him, Em describes himself as someone who keeps moving along despite all the pressure around him.<br />Say Goodbye to Hollywood - This seems to be Em saying that after all the things that have happened to him, he can't be carefree anymore.<br />Drips - A tale about how Obie Trice hooked up with a fictional girlfriend of Eminem, and wound up getting some kind of STD.  Basically, this song is a graphic picture about the dangers of unprotected sex.<br />Without Me - The traditional, catchy, leadoff single with the Slim Shady persona in full force.  Sounds different enough from \\"My Name Is\\" and \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" to hold its own.<br />Paul Rosenbeurg(skit) - Em's manager urgently warns him not to carry his gun around.<br />Sing for the Moment - Using a sample of Aerosmith's \\"Dream on\\", Em tells us in his own unique way how and why kids are drawn to him and entertainers in general.<br />Superman - A twisted semi-love song about Em's ex-wife.  He indicates they may get back together down the road, but for now he could care less because \\"I can't be your Superman\\".<br />Halie's Song - A heartfelt ode to his beloved daugher.  Em himself admits that he can't sing that good.  Someone said how this sounded similar to the boy bands that Em puts down.  Well, the difference is he wrote this himself, and the feelings are real.<br />Steve Berman(skit) - The head of Interscope records doesn't get a chance to say what he wants to say about this album.<br />When the Music Stops - The members of D-12 lend a hand in telling how life can be rough when the focus is not on music anymore.<br />Say What U Say - Em and Dre go back and forth in dissing Jermaine Dupri.<br />'Till I Collapse - The beat is identical to Queen's \\"We Will Rock You\\", and makes for an arena-rock sounding ode to Em's desire to continue on.  Nate Dogg provides a very catchy chorus.<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy - Em's daughter is featured here, and she comments on what we've known all along.  All the subject matter on the album is summed up well in the last few verses.<br />Curtains Close(skit) - Ken Kaniff is left all by himself as \\"The Eminem Show\\" ends.<br />... about for a sec then tells his mind.Em shows his songwriting gift.VERY GOOD SONG.<BR>20-Curtain's Close-Ken Keniff is back closing out the show.<br />Rating:<BR>15/10<br />This CD really impressed me and should impress you as well.<BR>Sorry this review is so long.Anyway this CD is well worth the 15 bucks.Hell, I think it should be more if u ask me.
6304698623|5.0|A really touching story about Sara.  COuldn't stop crying at the end.  Really woth watching.  Sara's voice is so soft and sweet, a real princess indeed.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is a great purchace for any cd buyer.  Her music is a twist of Alanis Morissette meets Natalie Imbruglia.  She's not another one of your teenie bopper type of girls.  She has a style and sound of her own.  I recommend her to anyone looking for a new artist.  I bought her cd and I haven't been able to put it down since.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jack Dawson, a poor artist who wins a ticket on Titanic's first voyage to New York.  He saves the life of Rose (Kate Winslett), who is engaged to the stuffy Cal (Billy Zane).  In only four days, Jack and Rose fall in love, and then disaster strikes.<br /><br />DeCaprio nicely captures the youth, romance, and energy of Jack. Winslett's performance just didn't ring true to me.  Zane was wonderful as the villian you love to hate. But the real star of the show is director James Cameron, who created jaw-dropping special effects on such a grand scale.  The sinking of the Titanic is unforgettable.  James Horner's soundtrack is memorable, too.  This movie deserved its Best Picture Oscar.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This is Michael when Michael WAS Michael,and not the washed up ghost he is today. this is definitely a &quot;road trip CD&quot; beacuse you will not skip one track. And EVERYBODY loves this CD;tyou could not like R&amp;B or rap and you know this CD!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Despite all the good things i'd heard about John Mayer, it took me finding live and studio mp3s in the middle of the night to realize how good he is.  I bought the CD the next day and it's one of the best CDs I've bought this spring. Anyone who likes this should check out Howie Day, Robert Randolph, and Matt Nathanson.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril burst onto the scene with her melodic and post hardcore beat in &quot;Complicated&quot; which is quickly rising to #1 on charts. And she continues to reign with her cd entitled &quot;let go&quot;. <BR> Her music is compiled from past experiences and difficulties. What seperates her from other artists is her ability to put all of her emotions into her songs succesfully and make it sound great.<BR> Some people tend to compare her to Alanis Morisette, but I say nay. She has her own sound, she can only be and sound like Avril. And she shows and creates her originality in &quot;Anything but Ordinary&quot;. Obviously not afraid with her own style, her cd has so much variety that it makes it hard to realize its still her. In the first 3 songs she goes from a slow-fast paced rock song &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, and then goes to a ballad that everyone knows, loves, and can sing along with &quot;Complicated&quot; which tells about how she despises poseurs (people who are not them selves and act like other people to try and be cool). And then she moves on to &quot;S8er Boi&quot; which tells about a girl who's friends thought she was to good for the skater boy and later regrets it. Which seems to be yet another song about being yourself, which would have payed off in this case.<BR> The 4th track on this excellent cd is titled &quot;I'm With You&quot;. It starts with a soft tone and really continues like that for the most of the song. It just shows that Avril really does put all of her heart into every song she writes. The 5th track &quot;Mobile&quot; just seems to make you feel better when you listen to it. I often find myself singing along to it (not a pretty sight!). She just tells how she feels like most of her other songs. In track 6 &quot;Unwanted&quot; she just seems to be talking about relationships. In track 7 &quot;Tomorrow&quot; she tells about how if she just waits everything might just go back together. <BR> Track 9 &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; is a nice upbeat song. &quot;My World&quot; is a fun song that tells about her hometown of Napanee and just about herself in her own little world. &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; is probably one of the most interesting songs on the cd. It almost sounds like she is rapping (she does a good job) about how she has changed. It also is one of the most original songs that I have ever heard on a rock cd. &quot;Too Much to Ask&quot; is a nice melodic song that has great vocals (pretty much like the rest of the cd). &quot;Naked&quot; is a moody song about her changing and finding that person that just makes her feel different (in a special way).<BR> All in all, this is a great cd and I recommend it to everyone in the world. Fans don't lie, she already has over 12,000 supporters. If you liked &quot;Complicated&quot;, you will like this whole cd.
0064400557|4.0|Unlike many children's stories, Charlotte's Web is bittersweet. Most children will regard this as a welcome change. Some will refuse to eat pork. Others, like me, will develop a lifelong fondness for spiders. This story doesn't click along predictably like most do, yet it isn't full of melodrama either. I especially like the character of the little girl, Fern, who does some growing up along with her animal friends. The ending is a tearjerker but it does offer some hope.
B00000JRTX|5.0|Fans of Hugh Grant will enjoy this very funny and touching British comedy about a group of close British friends who go through life-changing events (marriages, funerals) together. The very engaging cast includes Kristin Scott Thomas, Andie MacDowell, and Grant, who plays his usual charmer with much stammering and eyelid-fluttering.
B000002B1M|3.0|How in the hell can Nas come out with Illmatic then put out this shining example of mediocrity? An obvoius example of selling out, children. Buyer beware.
0441003257|5.0|Following the last item read by my book club (The Screwtape Letters), I simply had to read Good Omens again.  Read both!<br />The Apocalypse:  so many treatises have been written, from John of Patmos to \\"Left Behind\\".  None quite get around to addressing the apocalyptic impact on the rest of the universe:  So what's an Angel to do, after It is All Over?  Really, when it's all said and done, it's just bad for business, this End of the World.<br />There aren't quite any heroes, as we follow the tale of an angel and demon, who have developed quite a good working relationship since that whole Eden scandal.  Both are stunned to realize that everything they enjoy here on Earth (bookstores, Bentleys) is about to come to a screeching halt in 11 years, when the Anti-Christ comes into his Power.  So, they wait at the birthday party when the Hell-hound is due to arrive as a sort of present from the powers below.  And the dog doesn't arrive.  Um ... if this isn't the Antichrist ... ?<br />Overwhelming wit and satire.  And things that one (at least this one) doesn't often contemplate:  so what do demons discuss at their regular staff meetings?<br />A completely light-hearted look at the End of the World As We Know It.  Or is it light-hearted?<br />Through the demon's part of the story, the authors have modernized the picture of evil.  Crawley, the demon, shakes his head and is constantly annoyed at the 14th century minds of demons who think lacivious thoughts are the fulcrum of mortal temptation to sin.  Crawley is a modern chap:  he ties up the entire London phone system for 45 minutes at lunch and just watches the horrors perpetrated by man upon his fellow man spread out like ripples on a pond.<br />Like the advice of Screwtape to his nephew, damnation is just handing the humans enough rope.  They'll do all the hard work for you.<br />While Good Omens is almost incessantly funny, do not let the humor distract you from a vital point:  if we cling to old ideas of the Apocalypse, we'll never see It coming.e, we'll never see It coming.
B000060P79|5.0|I bought this CD thinking that Simple Plan would be like any other punk band.  But they surprised me.  Each song was unique and none of them sounded the same.  My favorite song is &quot;Meet You There&quot; which is very sweet.  This is their first CD and I cannot wait for their next ones.  They should definitely keep up the good work and I hope to see them at the Vans Warped Tour!
B000066NW0|5.0|About 6 days ago I never was really into any kind of music. I didn't listen to pretty much anything. But one day I was watch TV and I saw the &quot;complicated&quot; video by Avril Lavigne. I was blown away. It was GREAT. I couldn't get enough of it actually so I went to the store (because I needed it right then and there i counldn't wait) and I got the last copy. I started to play it in my car on the way home and (many people dont say this) the entire CD was great. not 2 or 3 songs but all 13. Its an amazing CD. But then when I got home i put it in my computer because this cd is and Enhanced cd. this means that there are &quot;extra&quot; features. there is the complicated video, a bio, even and bonus song. So if you haven't got this CD yet go get it now. it is worth it.<br />Brian (Wolker)
B00006690F|5.0|I thought that Eminem's latest cd was great. I dont own it but I have heard all of it and I plan on getting it asap.
B000066NW0|5.0|I recently just bought Avril Lavignes new cd \\" Let Go\\". I love her unique voice and style. Her song \\"Naked\\" is a song that I found I could relate to most. The song \\"Losing Grip\\" shows a more hard side of Avril, while \\"Things I'll never say\\" is a much softer side to her. I think this cd has good variety and originality,and has songs that anyone could relate to on any level. This should be a cd at the top of everyones list to buy!
B00005R2M3|3.0|Shakira is clearly a hot young star on the rise.  In addition to her amazing sensuality, she actually has a Voice!  This separates her from the Barbies gyrating around on stages in front of brainwashed marketees.  BUT---have you seen Shakira live and in person?  Anyone who saw the Divas LasVegas knows Shakira brought the house down and earned a LONG standing O.  That is where this young lady might win America over--she has Style,and a great presence on stage that transcends the recording studio.
0896760839|5.0|Once again, Janet Arnold has firmly reinforced her position at the top of the world of historical costume research.  Housed within the pages of this book is some of the most invaluable research in the field of 16th century costuming.  Arnold examines extant clothing of 16th century nobility and drafts the pattern pieces in detail.  Rare photographs of these garments, as well as detailed shots of seams, linings, and stitching and fabric close-ups makes this book one of the most important in the field of historical costuming.  Patterns are given for the garments examined, but be aware, they are not sized.  Some knowledge of pattern drafting, or access to an enlarger of some kind will be needed if you want to take a pattern from this book and make it fit a human being.  But don't let that discourage you!  The information within this book is priceless and for any die-hard 16th century enthusiast, it is perhaps the best book available on the subject.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's first CD &quot;Let Go&quot; is very both inspiring nad wonderful! The fact that she pushed Arista Records to let her write her own music was completely amazing  and to be put beside Alanis Morissette, as a younger version, right away is no suprise! Her lyrics are wonderful and meaningful that everyone can relate to at one point or another. Her band is awesome and I highly recommend this CD!!<BR>If you have AOL, go to keyword: Avril and watch her Sessions@AOL performance. She sings 3 songs that are on the cd,Things I Won't Say,Mobile,Tomorrow,and Complicated.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne has made one hell of an album! She (unlike many other female artists, i wont say who..ahem..britney.) is the kind of girl I am proud to say I respect. Some female and male artists are nothing but fakes...Britney again. Avril, is a chick that is nothing fake. She shows what she really is, she's a little skater chick from a small town in Ontario, just like I am. Avril's voice is amazing! I'm sure if you've heard her single \\"Complicated\\" on the radio/t.v. its been stuck in your head. Its the best song out there because Avril doesn't think \\"O.k., I'll sing alright but look really good in the video.\\" Avril, never change.
B000066NW0|5.0|<br />Im a rock fan and simply rock fan only hard rock fan (Korn, Slipknot, Slayer) I hate all the music my sister listens to infact I cant stand it. I rather listen to finger nails on a chalk board then that... <br />My sister came home after school and said she got a new CD. I said o great more crap I have to listen to for the next year. She shows me this chick I've never seen named Avril Lavigne. She pops it into the CD player beside the computer I was on. From the start some of the tunes were in my head and I was slowly begining to actually like this cd (If my friends read this I will get a beating of a liftime lol)<br />Well afer a day of nothing but Avril I made myself a copy of the CD on the front I put with marker Korn (so my sister did not think I was listening to this)<br />In my car I listen to it at home it's allways on and there is not 1 song that you have to skip because they are all that good.<BR>This is probably more of a girl CD with lyrics but trust me it's very catchy stuff that actually has meaning,Unlike artists that are put together or dont write their own songs this girl is gonna be a future star no question. (I must sound so soft lol)<br />I ended buying the CD for my 2 causins on their birthday. If you know a girl from 11-25 a need a birthday gift or something. Get this CD trust me.
B00005YU1O|2.0|Ugh. I hate this movie more than any film I have ever seen in my life, and frankly, this film deserves it. The whole concept of this movie is one dopey looking guy wandering around and waking up from his dream, while not really waking. That's not so bad. The horrible part is a bunch of 15 year olds just finished reading Philosophy for Dummies and a few other new age books, and they want to share their horribly flawed views of the universe with horrendous leaps in logic. Oh, and they're armed with a thesaurus. It's a pretentious \\"Who can use the biggest words\\" game throughout, and it impresses no one. Add in a few adjectives that serve no purpose, and the result is four guys walking down the street when one shouts \\"Society is choking on its own vehnile existence in a swarm of complacency\\" and one replies \\"We are dancing exuberance in the light of eternity!\\" I think this may be an attempt to hide the fact that what they are actually talking about is very simple, and often, very silly. One man takes 10 minutes of droning on to say that leaps in human advancement are happening in shorter and shorter amounts of time, which is a decent observation, then out of nowhere he says evolution and survival of an organism will depend on truth, justice, morality, and sincerity. There are a few good speeches in there, one at the very end and a few in between, but it's hard to take any of them seriously when they describe free will and the nature of the self with healthy doses of \\"like, y'know\\" every other line. The only pros this movie has is the great visual style, and that it facilitates conversation (although most of the conversation will be \\"WHAT THE? I HATE THIS MOVIE!\\"). Don't buy this. Rent it once, laugh, cry, shout, have a real discussion about the topics without the bs involved, and go on with your waking life.
B0000640VN|2.0|I can only give this a solid C-.  Not only was the movie extremely jagged and discontinuous but in one key scene Leopold attempts to one up the villian by displaying how much he knows about opera.  Unfortunately, Leopold was from 1876 and the opera he chose was La Boheme which was written in 1895. (Perhaps the world's easiest job is to be a Hollywood fact checker).  Only to be watched if in the throes of severe movie withdrawl.

B00005NP04|5.0|I knew I would like this CD, having heard most of the songs, like the emotional &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Safe In The Arms Of Love&quot; the ballad &quot;Valentine&quot; the sweet &quot;Happy Girl&quot; and the song I heard off the movie &quot;Where The Heart Is&quot;, the song &quot;There You Are&quot;. All these songs, and more, are what Martina is famous for! Keep going Martina, you have a loyal fan in me!
B000065U1N|4.0|To start off with, before or after seeing the movie, reading the book would be a huge plus because the book is incredibly good.  It may well fill in any gaps or questions that were not addressed in the movie.  Seeing the movie after reading the book, It was very apparent that the movie followed the book very closely and was excellently done.<br />The movie does not delve into the politics of the U.S. in Somalia but it does give an introductory, although short, explanation why we were there and what we were trying to accomplish.  Some reviewers have stated that we shouldn't have been there in the first place.  Let's take a look - it was reported that 300,000 Somalian citizens had starved to death because their emergency food supplies (flown in by the U.S.) were taken away by Somalian warlords.  The Somalian militias then attacked U.N. peacekeeping forces and rendered them just about useless.  The United States was about the only nation left to go and render aid and assistance because no one else was going to do it.  We had honest and just reasons to try to shut down the warlords and help a country that was harboring genocidal killers that were perpetrating vicious crimes against humanity.<br />Being in the military myself for 14 years now, I can relate to what goes through a soldiers mind and why we in the military are asked to do certain things that the average citizens of our country cannot always relate to.  It's not easy to explain, but we in the military are very proud and rely on honor, integrity, teamwork, and pride.  We work very hard to protect our country, other countries, and those in the world who cannot protect themselves and who need our help.  This is just one of the reasons that makes America great.<br />In October of 1993, some 100 or so U.S. Military Forces comprised of the Army Rangers, Delta Force, and the Special Operations Aviation Regiment (S.O.A.R.) were tasked to extricate two key individuals in the warlord clan led by Mohammed Aidid to help stop the crimes against the Somalian people.  This extrication was to take place in an extremely hostile area in the middle of the city of Mogadishu in broad daylight.  According to initial planning, it was to be a 30 to 35 minute operation which ended up playing out to be a horrifying 16 to 18 hour ordeal.  The reality at the onset was looking to be successful until two Blackhawk type helicopters were shot down using rocket propelled grenades (RPG's).<br />The U.S. soldiers were immediately thrown into an environment of total chaos being that the Somalian militias were very heavily armed and attacked from every section of the city.  Adding to the misery was that hundreds, if not thousands of Somalian citizens had weapons also and relentlessly attacked our soldiers for hours on end without hesitation.  The U.S. soldiers, taking many disastrous casualties and injuries of their own, secured both helicopter crash scenes, fought all the way through with almost unheard of courage and determination, brought all of their wounded and dead out that they could, and showed more bravery and resolve than could ever be asked of anyone.<br />Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer have long been involved in movies of non-stop action and heart pounding excitement.  I don't see this movie as so much an action movie but compare it more to a documentary and an entirely realistic vision of what actually happened on that fateful day.  I believe that the movie was exceptionally well made and showed exactly what needed to be showed.  This was not a movie to be a forum for the politics of why we were there.  The movie states why we were there and how the military was intimately involved.  If there is anyone who questions our military or how good they really are or what sacrifices we have made in history for our country and other countries, this movie is indicative of why our country is the greatest with the greatest military.  This is probably one of the 10 best war films ever made and I thinkit is important for U.S. citizens to really know what happened that day in Somalia to get a clear picture.<br />I couldn't give this review 5 stars because of the poor content of the DVD release.  There are trailers for 2 movies but neither are for Black Hawk Down.  Not good.  There is no directors commentary and no worthwhile featurettes.  Why?  In the age of digital sound and video, we are seeing much more of DTS sound on large amounts of DVD releases.  The 5.1 Dolby surround on this movie was excellent but DTS would have been sensational and they should have considered this when making the DVD.  I have a reasonably good suspicion that they will re-release this DVD with a load of extra's in the future and possibly DTS sound.  It may be worth the wait.<br />If you like war movies, especially those that are based on true events and very accurate, you will probably find Black Hawk Down to your liking.  A small word of warning though.  This movie depicts very graphic scenes of injuries and carnage and death.  But, that is precisely how it should have been done so that the viewer can relate to what actually happened.  I hope most of you will be able to appreciate this movie as much as I did.it is important for U.S. citizens to really know what happened that day in Somalia to get a clear picture.<br />I couldn't give this review 5 stars because of the poor content of the DVD release.  There are trailers for 2 movies but neither are for Black Hawk Down.  Not good.  There is no directors commentary and no worthwhile featurettes.  Why?  In the age of digital sound and video, we are seeing much more of DTS sound on large amounts of DVD releases.  The 5.1 Dolby surround on this movie was excellent but DTS would have been sensational and they should have considered this when making the DVD.  I have a reasonably good suspicion that they will re-release this DVD with a load of extra's in the future and possibly DTS sound.  It may be worth the wait.<br />If you like war movies, especially those that are based on true events and very accurate, you will probably find Black Hawk Down to your liking.  A small word of warning though.  This movie depicts very graphic scenes of injuries and carnage and death.  But, that is precisely how it should have been done so that the viewer can relate to what actually happened.  I hope most of you will be able to appreciate this movie as much as I did.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This could have been a great action packed film about the famous battle but instead hollywood turned it into a stupid mushy love triangle that had nothing to do with the battle at all... put out by hollywood they changed details to be \\"politically correct\\" but all they did was ruin it WW11 veterans are probably and should be angered by this twsiting of history. I suggest don't buy this dvd or watch it isnt worth the money at all i wouldnt pay [$] for it in a sales bin ...
1878424319|1.0|The book is full of excellant advice. Not only that, but the authour also convinces you with those advices. You know when you where young people tell you to do things, but you they don't tell you why.The style is excllant and easy to follow. The advices are pricelss and will probably server you well for the rest of your life.  You will need to keep the book though in order to look at it every once in a while.<BR>    But with all this admiration, and respect I have for the book and the authour, why did I give him one point.  Well, many people won't like this opinion, but I didn't like it when he said that you can have a small god and worship him (an idol).  I am a believer in God, and I know that God doesn't need any idols to worship him, you can always talk to him directly.  That was the only thing I didn't like in the book, and to me it is a major thing, but never the less the advice is excellant, and the book is great. I will certainly keep an eye for new books by the author. And I hope that God would guide him.<BR>    I apologize if my comments were offending to some people, please accept my humble appologies, but that is my opinion. I have no grudges against any religion or any one, and I wish all the best.  And I leave you in peace.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's cd Let Go is the best cd I have listened to in the past couple of years. The songs on the cd express how she feels about relationships and how people should be REAL. She is a very talented artist and I hope that her cd will have very wonderful success. She is a highly original artist, and I believe she has amazing talent. <BR>The cd is definitely worth buying. The songs vary in style, and the lyrics are very true. Each song has it's own meaning and the music behind the lyrics contributes a lot to the sound and makes the songs great. I definitely reccommend everyone to buy her cd. It is a very good cd, and she deserves recognition because the lyrics are original and the fact that she is only 17 years old shows that there will be many more great things to look forward to from her in the future.
B000066NW0|5.0|this cd is the best out of all the cds this has got to be my favorite i mean i listen to it everyday and i would hope that someday i could be just like her, her songs just made me feel like i was there when that was happening or goin on i just love her and her music thats all i got to say so Rock On! and follow ur dream u never know what might happen
B000066NW0|5.0|come on people you have to buy avril lavinge cd ley go because it is so awsome.I havent stopped listening to it since i got it.<BR>It is just that awsome and avril did such a good job at sigingthem
B00005JKED|3.0|One cannot certainly argue the merits of Denzel Washington's performance as the crooked but hard-hitting cop in TRAINING DAY.<br />One, however, can easily argue the merits of whether or not the performance deserved Academy Award recognition, and I would imagine that this will become an argument for the ages.<br />Is it truly noteworthy (or awardworthy) to grant one of cinema's most gift and rightfully revered African American actors the distinction of playing such a stereotypical role?  In all honesty, does Mr. Washington want to be remember more for THIS role than he would the perceptive Ezekial Rawlins in DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS ... or the brave submarine commander in CRIMSON TIDE ... or the military officer trying to find a personal sense of purpose in death in combat in COURAGE UNDER FIRE ... or the Civil Rights leader in MALCOLM X?<br />Granted, the AMPAS cannot undo history and go back to honor Denzel for roles that truly showed distinction, but we've seen the detective he played in TRAINING DAY in hundreds of other films, portrayed by hundreds of other gifted actors, in similar situations.  To award someone with the talent of Denzel Washington film's highest honor for such a stereotypical role is, perhaps, film history's greatest injustice.<br />That said, the plot -- while predictable -- unfolds as the young recruit (played by the always-forgettable Ethan Hawke) realizes he's being used, rises to the occasion, and saves the day.
B000000YBQ|5.0|Jazz at it's BEST!!!!!!! It's smooth, classy and very musical.If it were possible to wear CD's out like records , I would be in the market for another already.I'm in love with this one.
068484267X|5.0|I found this amazing book totally refreshing - Frank McCourt has such a unique style of writing. Although the actual content of the book is very emotional and depressing, the personality of the writer and his descriptions of the other characters (I love his description of the girl he met in the city hospital)makes the book very uplifting.<BR>I've also read the sequel ''tis' which tells the story of his time in the states. I loved this book too. Frank McCourt is my favourite writer - can't wait until he brings out another book!
1563523302|4.0|This book is from research done in the 90s concerning millionaires in the United States.  Using surveys, interviews, and tax information, this book draws a picture of the millionaire.  The picture will likely not match your idea.<br />Does having the statistical picture of a millionaire help?  After reading this book, I am inclined to say \\"yes.\\"  Seeing fancy clothes, expansive homes, and expensive cars reminded me of wealth.  As pointed out, the average millionaire is not concerned with the appearance of wealth.  For some reason, knowing that I don't have to look wealthy calms me and encourages me.<br />One concept that will stay with me is the necessity of offense and defense to attain wealth.  The authors point out that merely earning lots of money (offense) will not always help.  Just as in sports, you need to play good defense to win.  Here, the author's point out that you need to control your spending and debt if you want to reach wealth.<br />This book was recommended in \\"The Cashflow Quadrant\\" book (of the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series).  I would also recommend this.  Although the tables will sometimes be distracting, there is some good information here.
0553278398|5.0|Here, in what is the first of the Foundation series, Hari Seldon comes to Trantor to discuss his paper on a mysterious theory (Psychohistory) at a conference. The plot quickly thickens when we find out that the Emperor's right-hand man is interested in this theory. Seldon is contacted by the Emperor, and after an unproductive meeting he goes into hiding in the relatively safe University district of Trantor. The book continues, but ends with an explosive and suprising finale
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut cd \\"Let Go\\" is as good or even better than i expected.  I waited to buy the cd the day it came out because i heard her song \\"complicated\\" and downloaded most of her songs on my computer.  I was wicked impressed by her singing style and ability to be herself. She is a great romodel.  She has already become one of my idols.  She is alot like me because she is a skater like me who looks down on posers and fake people.  I think it's wicked that she can be totally herself and still have people love and look up to her!  Thanks Avril and keep it real!
B000066NW0|5.0|Hi PEoplE I'M writing to tell u ... BUY HER CD ! u know in a cd theres always songs we prefer...

BElieve Me !!! yeah this girl is my model and I really would like to be an artist like her !!!!!! VIVA ROCK CHIX !!!...
B000066NW0|5.0|&quot;Let Go&quot; is a genuine compilation of self expression set to melody.  A mix of pop, rock, and punk, Avril's sound is unique and completely fun to listen to.  Each song has a unique twist of pop while the lyrics are down to earth and reflective.  Vibrant and soulful vocals (think a sweet combination of Alanis, Sarah Mclachlan, and Dolores O'Riordan) glide above drums, guitar, and synth to really set this record apart from the rest.
B000066NW0|5.0|All right here i go. I'd like to say that the CD was awesome, it has amazing lyrics, it gives you a great pumped up feeling and no other person could have done a better job at singing them. I fully recommend buying the CD.

B0000640VO|5.0|This movie breaks the scale of new and inovative cinematography.  The best way to describe it would be an inspiring work of art.  The colors just jump off the screen as well as the characters.  Greatest work I have seen from the young and talented Audrey Tautou. I would recommend this movie to anyone due to the fact that it is my favorite movie of all times. If you can't buy it at least rent it when it is released because i garentee you will be buying it after all.
B00006690H|4.0|Eminem has done it again! Usually I am NOT a fan of his work BUT his song, \\"Without Me\\" is really good. Good Beats, music, the whole nine-yards. He even sings in one of the tracks, and his daughter is also in one of the tracks, \\"My Daddy's Gone Crazy\\" I think this CD is better then the first and I would Recomend it to anyone who is even thinking of buying it!
0783225970|5.0|This movie has been and can be seen from many different aspects<BR> but I see it for what it is, a great movie.A provacative, raw  <BR> movie,that gives you a hard-core visual of what the streets are like.Al Pacino gives an explosive performance that is uncomparable and unforgettable.This DVD restores all of the original integrity that makes it great and it is a MUST OWN.
B000002O3I|5.0|Arguably the best blues albumn ever recorded is paired with &quot;Moanin' in the Moonlight&quot; (Itself among the greatest).  That makes this a must have for anyone with an interest in blues.<br />Howlin Wolf's sound is primal, emotional and deep American music.  It's sad that a lot of people really aren't aware of his music and his reputation is kept alive among blues lovers.  He never gained the fame Muddy Waters did among non-genre fans.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy this two albumn cd.  It will be like nothing you've ever heard and you'll become a fan for life.
B000066NW0|5.0|Wow! I wouldn't have ever thought I'd want a CD as much as I wanted this one.  I had to go to 3 different places to finally find it! People thought I was crazy because I was having a fit when I couldn't find it.  This CD is the best CD I own! I'm a total Britney Spears fan but Avril has got Britney beat big time! Avril writes her own songs and all the songs on here people can relate to.  It's great that she comes from the heart and lets people know what she's thinking! This is a CD everyone should own, young and old.  GO OUT AND BUY IT!
B000065U1N|5.0|This is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. It pulls no punches and doesn't waste any time getting to the action. I like the way it ACCURATELY portrays the ACTUAL EVENTS that took place. It pays tribute to the men who fought and died there and reflects credit on the cast and crew who made the movie. I highly reccomend this film to anyone who is interested in a gritty and graphic film about the &quot;fog of war&quot;.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne<br />Do you feel that you are &quot;Losing Grip&quot; with music these days? Can't stand those songs that are &quot;Complicated&quot;, and hard to understand?  Want some music that you and your &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; can listen to together? Afraid that when you go to the cd store that you are going to spend all of your money out of control like a &quot;Mobile&quot; on cd's you don't really want? Well, cross all of those &quot;Unwanted&quot; cd's off of your list! &quot;Tomorrow&quot; when you go to the store, you should buy a cd that is &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;. Avril Lavigne's new cd may be just what you are looking for. Whats so special about this cd? Well, some &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;, but I will tell you this. When i listen to this cd i am in &quot;My World&quot;, and it has taught me that i am &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;. Also, if it isn't &quot;Too Much To Ask&quot;, don't go to the store &quot;Naked&quot;, they might kick you out before you get a chance to buy the cd. <br />Buy &quot;Let Go&quot; by Avril Lavigne.<br />This cd rocks! i have been playing it non-stop since i bought it!
B00003CXI1|5.0|I thought the movie was quite good, though it brought to mind Star Wars, The dark side, and James and the Giant Peach, the evil \\"parents.\\"  I think Rowling could have been more original.  However, it made me feel like I wanted to be a wizard, much like Star Wars made me want to be a Jedi.  The story captivating, the effects excellent.  Worth purchasing.
B000066NW0|5.0|There just aren't any words to describe this CD.  It is so good that it just sends chills down your back, it is deffinately a &quot;Must Have&quot;.  All of the songs say every word that you wish you knew how to say. It is just one of those CD's that you can listen to over and over again and you get the same feeling that you did when you first bought it.  I have never been so satisfied in a CD until I bought Avril's &quot;Let Go&quot;.  You can't be dissapointed, I know that I wasn't.
B000066NW0|5.0|I first saw this girl's video on MuchMusic (Canadian version of MTV) in May and have been dying to get my hands on her debut when it came out in Jume. She has written all of her songs, she can play the gutair, and on top of that, she has a powerhouse voice that is mature beyond her 17 years. There is not anything \\"pop\\" about her music, but her appeal should be to those who have grown tired of the pop music scene. Think SUM 41. She is a cute skater chic with a great future, and this album really rocks!
B0000648WZ|5.0|Robocop director Paul Verhoeven brings us another epic battle between good and evil... Only this time, the enemy has eight limbs and there's not a giant slipper in sight!<br />The story is simple; a rookie space cadet flies to a far off planet and discovers love, loss and aliens with pointy slice-happy pincers. So naturally, the film does have Verhoeven's trademark touch of extream violence, and Starship Troopers especially manages to make Reservoir Dogs look like a Disney movie! <br />But don't be put off, it's great fun. Character development and meaningfull dialogue are kept to a minimum, to make way for full on action and suspence all the way! The leads are just right, the special effects will blow you away and the direction is up to Verhoeven's usuall standard... PERFECT! All I can say really, is BYE IT!
B00003CXRP|1.0|Tom Hanks is a great talented actor. No doubt about that. He's great in Forrest Gump, Sleepless in Seattle, Big, Apollo 13... and lots more. But Cast Away is a waste of talent, seriously.<br />The story is about Tom Hanks as a Federal Express officer who was very dedicated to his job. One night the flight that he took crashed in the middle of nowhere and he was the only survivor. And for the remaining of the movie, we'll see Tom Hanks talking to a volleyball named Wilson and making fire. He managed to get lots of stuff by opening the sealed packages that were to be delivered if not for the crash. Strangely, he spared one for no clear reason. I guess it was done so for the ending.<br />The movie started well, but lost its direction. Some people may be able to endure watching Tom Hanks alone on an island for a couple of hours, but most people will find it dead boring.<br />Story apart, the discs are well packaged, but I could not see why one wants to watch the movie more than once.
0800141660|5.0|I think this is one of those rare films that manage to be actually better than the books they were based on. Sense and Sensibility is widely believed to be Jane Austen's worst work - it was her first - but this movie is a wonderful adaptation. The screenplay couldn't have been better and Emma Thompson deserved the Oscar. Somehow I'm surprised it was Kate Winslet who got nominated for her acting, for somehow I preferred Emma Thompson who catches your attention in every scene. Watch the scene, for instance, when she says - &quot;What do you know of my heart? What do you know of anything but your own suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I have had this pressing <BR>on me without being at liberty to speak of it to a single <BR>creature ... Believe me, Marianne, had I not been bound to silence I could have produced proof enough of a broken heart. Even for you.&quot;<BR>You understand Elinor's character as you never have before in this one scene. In fact, it is scenes like this that manage to turn this movie from a comedy to a drama. While as much Jane Austen's wit as it is possible to transfer to celluloid is here, the theme of filial love and attachment which Jane Austen never quite managed to actually write appear, which makes this much more satisfying. In Pride and Prejudice, for instance, the climax of the book, when Mr. Darcy finally proposed to Elizabeth, Jane Austen switches from direct to indirect speech, indicating some sort of inability to write about the strongest emotions directly. The emotions are always implied, never actually described. The movie manages to add this dimension to a book that isn't quite my favourite. Other favourite scenes - Willoughby quoting Shakespeare's Sonnet 119 to Marianne, and the scene where she recites it in a thunderstorm. Neither scene is in the book, but it never seems out of place.<BR>Watch this movie - one of the best I've seen in the past few years.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is the best CD i've ever heard! First of all, the CD album's title is amazing itself! It really makes you want to &quot;let go&quot; when you're listening to the album! Each song is totally differet with a little punk, pop, rock, and even a teensy weensy bit of country. Avril's voice is unbelievably beautiful and it's not techno or computer-animated like Britney Spears. You can tell that Avril sings from the heart. Another great thing about this CD is that all of the songs were written by Avril. That again proves that this was written about Avril's feelings and it's totally sung from the heart. I think that this CD definitely deserves to be #1 on everything! ROCK ON AVRIL!
B0000640VO|5.0|It is a rare thing to watch something as beautiful as Amelie and even better because it happens to be in French. Which makes it an even stronger endeavor. I loved it from the very first scene, and by the end I was crying tears of joy. It is beauty in it's simplest form. True beauty! Not the commercialized, hollywood defenition; it is the real thing and the sad part about that is most people will fail to see it or understand. If we could all only see the world through the eyes of Amelie or those of Nino. What a world that would be; it would be pure. I loved it and believe it to be one of the greatest films ever made. The strength is in the story line and the way that the actors and actresses bring each character alive. I watched this film three nights in a row; I am lucky in that I work for a video store and I was able to view it through a demo tape. I would encourage everyone to see this film. I believe that if everyone watches this film with an open heart and mind that it will touch their lives. Then they in turn will touch others around them. Beauty is in the simplest of things; if only we could remember that every day. Ameile will touch the soul and you will be begging for more. This is a masterpiece of the age. A classic among so many films that tend to be boring and void.  This film is what making and watching films are all about. It is a Monet of the year 2001. It will last through out time
B000066NW0|5.0|I could put this CD into two words loved it!<BR>When I like people and there music I only like 4 or 5 songs on the CD it's self but with Avril lavigne it's all good...I can't think of one song I don't like. All hers songs speak and talk about what's going on and teens like me can relate to that and you can understand what she's saying.<BR>The other thing that's cool about this is the picture inside. When she's getting her picture she's not all like :D and stuff like b. spears and everything, she's her self, which is really <BR>cool.<BR>Now back to the music and the CD. Well there's (in my opinion) nothing wrong with this CD. It's like the best and I really really really loved it. I give it two thumbs up.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's album &quot;Let Go&quot; is certainly the best album that I have ever held in my hands and played in my CD player. The lyrics are lyrics that I can actually relate to. I don't find many artists who write songs that amazing. Some really popular artists don't even write their own songs, unfortunatley. I feel that if more young artists like Avril start climbing the charts, then maybe a lot more people can feel that they can realte to the music. I've been waiting for an artist with such talent like Avril's amazing songwriting skills and vocal stylings for so long. I was getting sick of hearing nothing but rap and r&amp;b on TRL. I'm a girl who likes rock and if rock's what you got, then I'll listen. Rock, alternative, whatever it is, just aslong as it's not pop, r&amp;b, rap, etc. Not only is it the album that I can relate to, it's Avril as well. Me and my friends are also punk skateboarders, well some are learning how to skateboard, and we love to be individuals. We like to be different. I also think that Avril Lavigne deserves to be known as a really great artist. If there is such thing, I honestly think that Avril Lavigne's album, &quot;Let Go&quot;, should be known as the Best Album Ever.
B000066NW0|5.0|First of all I just want to say that i love Avril Lavigne as a person and of course for her music.I think that her new c.d. \\"Let Go\\" is one of the best I have ever heard.I love all of the songs,and it's cool to know that she wrote them all.If you've never heard any of Avril's song,i would recommend \\"Complicated\\" because it is a great song and it's my personal favorite off of her new c.d. So,give Avril a chance and go buy her awesome new c.d. today!
B000066NW0|5.0|Lately there have been many new artist coming out and they dont really have the talent or the look! I was getting really sick and tired of people trying to become famous just for the money and fame!!! But then one day i was watcing much music and i saw such an amazing/funy video! i called in everyday and e-mailed in everyday requesting that song--> called \\"complicated\\" by Avril Lavigne! She has both the look and the talent!!! HER voice is krazy!! She can sing so high!! Its amazing...She is soo pretty it makes me feel really sory for britney spears and cristina agulara who wear soooo much makeup to become as pretty as they are! ...I usually wait until I hear at least 3 songs from an artist before i buy their cd cause sometimes they only have 1 good song on their cd and then i waisted 20$ on one song...But i had a feeling that Avril Lavigne wuz Different!!! AND SHE WUZ!!!! All 13 songs on her cd are amazing!!! If You liked her song called \\"complicated\\" you will LOVE her cd...You can relate to all her songs in any way! There is a variation of styles of music on her cd! She is punk she is pop she is everything everyone else isn't!! She may seem like michele branch but SHE'S NOT!!!!!!! Avril has her own style of music/clothes and personality!!! She's not fake and when you listen to her cd and actually listen to the lyrics it seems as tho she's singing about my life exactly!!! and you can tell that she is real!! I recomend that you buy her cd called \\"Let Go\\" ITS AMAZING AND IT KICK...
0446677450|4.0|I found this book very interesting, because it changed my ways on thinking about money. In this book the author contrasts the differences in economic strategies between \\"Rich Dads\\" and \\"Poor Dads.\\" As I watch the lessons from both fathers I saw myself and my potential. I like his main theme was showing how to \\"make your money work hard for you instead of working hard for your money.\\" <br />I like this idea so much, because it is a very true. We need to learn how to manage money instead of working hard for our money. Also Kiyosaki said that we should not be afraid to invest our money, but should learn how to handle it. Many people are afraid of losing money. Kiyosaki used a lot of good examples in this book about this. I liked them so much because it helped me to see and understand clearly.<br />Also I liked the charts that he used in this book, because it was a very informative and easy to follow. Some parts of this book seemed a little repetitive, but I liked it because that is only done to really make these ideas stick. I like his enthusiasm  and encouragement of this book. This is a very useful and understandable for someone, like me, who doesn't know much about it.       <BR> The only things I don't like about this book/author: The criticizing of his dad, and the school system, and that it is a little repetitive, although the author says it is the key to learning effectively. But I want to read his other books. I found the charts informative and easy to follow and I highly recommend this book to all interested in business and those who want to be successful. It changed the way I look at money forever and for the better. I want to recommend this book to everyone I know.
B0000399WI|5.0|You know, this film is really popular. You see this DVD in every video store on the main shelf by the dozens because it is such a good seller. And surprisingly enough, this movie which is extremely popular amongst the general public is a very good film. It involves some prison inmates and their struggles against evil, and ultimately, their struggle for freedom. The acting is top-notch, and the screenplay is excellent and very engaging. The soundtrack is pretty goodd too. The movie has a nice messages about how nice it would be to transcend all of the corruption in teh world and just leave somplace more simple where you can sand down boats on the beach and stuff.
B000066NW0|5.0|Alvril is the most talented person I have heard in so long! All My life it has been my dream to sing, but I am punk and there doesn't seem to be a big demand for female singers in that crowd. I wanted to look punk and act punk, but have my softer side. Alvril did just that, she has a voice of a angel and her words flow together so well. She tells stories in her music, which you don't see much of in the puck/pop communtity. There are only a few songs out there that can bring me to tears. Her first song on the CD did just that. The song is Called ''Losing Grip'' and it hit dead on with what has been going on in my life lately. Now not all the songs on this track are like that. There are some fun upbeat songs on here for those of you out there that have that need. But even those all have a messege behind them. She has very quickly become my favorite singer/song writer and I hope that everyone that reads this gives her a try. I want her to be around for a long, long time. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Enjoy. *Calley*
B000059HCN|5.0|Now why aren't films like this shown in school? Imagine students' reactions to the graphic display of the torture that drugs and addiction/obsession induce. Films such as Requiem For A Dream, American History X, Kids, Bully, and American Beauty are often frowned upon by society because they are merely holding up a mirror. Society never likes to see what it truly is. When the ignorant and soft-centered hypocrites are finally woken up to a real look at our society towering films, such as this will get their just rewards.<br />  Just for starters, Ellen Burstyn. I would love to meet the people who voted Julia Roberts Best Actress in 2000 and have them watch this film again. A powerful and deeply gripping performance is given here. Easily her best since \\"The Exorcist\\" or \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" (the film that captured her first Oscar). Portraying a woman whose obsession with a diet program, a red dress, and her social image can only bring the worst for her.<br />  Jared Leto gives an equally powerful performance as her son, Harry. A young drug-dealer who struggles at his mother's question \\"how is your work going?\\" I mean, who could look their elderly mother in the eye and say, \\"It's great, I deal drugs.\\" A sickening addiction to heroine and its grisly consequences leave the viewer inspired and hopefully enlightened.<br />  Jennifer Connelly was certainly overlooked at the Oscars as well. An Oscar-worthy performance certainly is given in this film. Marianne, whom will do just about anything for what her mind desires. The rage in her eyes and the burning in her tone bring the viewer as close to the mind of a sickened, sexual drug addict as is possible.<br />  Finally, Marlon Wayans. Who knew he could act? He gives an absolute amazing performance in this film as Harry's friend Tyrone. He gives a small yet adequate dose of humor that prevents the film from being 2 hours of depressing cinema.<br />  Darren Aronofsky brilliantly directs this, certainly an Oscar-worthy directing job throughout. Various new techniques are employed, split screen scenes, sudden fast motion, slow motion, and just about simultaneously showing 3 different scenes at the same time make this a trip that the view will not easily forget.<br />  Finally, Clint Mansel's menacing score is a must-have. A simple theme is repeated but altered enough that you don't get sick of it. Haunting synthesizers and a special performance from the Kronos quartet dominates this film.<br />  So, I find that when films like this are released, society shuts them away because we don't wanna hear what's wrong with us today. Well, we can't fix what is wrong until filmmaker's like Darren Aronofsky, Tony Kaye, and Sam Mendes truly and brutally show us. But when will we listen?car-worthy directing job throughout.

B000066F6H|4.0|Where the Strokes are more of a garage band, the Hives have really embraced the punk spirit.  A lot of the songs have punk anger yet it's obvious the band are having a lot of fun.  I would say this album hits the mark more than pop punk bands like Green Day and Blink 182.  The Hives aren't so concerned with hooks and catchy choruses.  This album is so much fun to listen to!  It's noisy and loud and you will still find yourself singing along.
B000002KHH|5.0|I am a big fan of &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and believe it or not, this is the first compact disc (CD) that I've bought by the great group. When I listen to music I look for great tunes, awesome instrumentals, and great voices. With this &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; CD I got everything that I was looking for. All of the songs on this marvelous album are wonderful and will be listened to over and over again. <br /> Ozzy Osbourne does a great job with the singing part of the songs but all of the instrumentals really make this album stand out from the albums of other bands. I enjoy most of the songs on this album and they are a true pleasure to listen to. My favorite songs on this great album are &quot;Iron Man,&quot; &quot;War Pigs (Luke's Wall),&quot; &quot;Paranoid,&quot; and &quot;Electric Funeral.&quot; <br /> The actual recordings of the songs are done very well but I had to blast my radio to really here the songs, which isn't really a big problem as you will really feel the songs. If you listen to the lyrics of the songs you will find out that all of the songs have a true meaning. &quot;Black Sabbath's Paranoid&quot; is a truly great CD that should definitely belong in everybody's music library. I look forward to buying more of &quot;Black Sabbath's&quot; recordings in the future. <br />Happy Listening!
0385503954|5.0|I finished reading Atonement two days ago, and it's still with me.  The drama of the first portion, the grim view of war in the second, but especially the shifting perspective of the storyline and the surprise at the end keeps me entertained and puzzling over &quot;what really happened&quot; on that summer night in 1935.  But my narrator Briony tells me not to do this.  Perhaps what happened is less significant than the reality of the fiction writer's desire of control--and lack of it--over life.  This book belongs in a course of contemporary British fiction or narrative point of view, but also belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who loves to read.

B000066NW0|5.0|Not only does this CD have great vocals, lyrics, and guitar work, but it also sends out a great message to everyone. Avril sings about being yourself and not letting what people say, what people think, or how people act effect who you are. She beleives in doing what you feel is right and what feels natural to you. I think everyone, no matter what music they listen to, should get a copy of this CD because everyone can learn a great lesson from Avril.
B00000K31Q|5.0|To be honest, I didn't know a whole lot about this movie, other than the title (which I remember being plastered on billboards all over with little to indicate what it was about).  I thought it was just another teen movie, though I had heard it was based on The Taming of the Shrew.  Being a fan of Shakespeare, I decided to watch it on USA today.  It is now on my list of must-buy DVDs!  It is finely written and well acted, an excellent modern day adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew.  It's nice to see a teen movie without sex scenes (At least I didn't see any in the USA edit), and little if any in the way of offensive language.
B000066NW0|5.0|Not only does this CD have great lyrics, awesome guitar work, and a great message but it is also inspirational. Avril sings about being yourself and how you shouldn't let what other people think, say, and how they act effect who you are. I think everyone can learn great things from Avril and her songs. Everyone should get a copy of this CD for their collection. It doesn't matter what kind of music you listen to, because this CD is just too good to pass up.
B00005JKCF|2.0|I was eagerly anticipating the big fight, where \\"Spidey\\" takes on \\"Iron Mike\\"...why, you may ask?   Every idiot who's played 'Mike Tyson's Punch Out' knows that the action sequences in Spiderman were all digital.  And, for that matter, the quality wasn't much better...every sequence with Spiderman, to me, was at best the equivalent of the digital Randy Moss from 'Madden 99'.  Was there only $$ forty-nine ninety-nine in funds allocated to the special effects budget?  <br />Also, a mild irritant during the picture was Willem Dafoe's somewhat \\"meaningless\\" presence in the picture.  One of the things superb \\"comic\\" books have, in general, is an adequate nemesis for the hero.  It makes one's heroic deeds that much more...\\"heroic.\\"  Lex Luther and Magneto (of Supermman and XMen fame, respectively), were ambitious \\"thinking men's\\" men, had purpose, and, ultimately, were the driving force of the story.  What was the \\"Green Goblin's\\" purpose?  To wreak havoc?...well, unfortunately, that was it.  Dafoe's mere presence was a joke...he looked like a reject \\"Mighty Morphin Power Ranger,\\" and spoke as if he were dubbing his lines from a remote soundstage in Kyoto after smoking 12 packs of Camels.  His \\"villany\\" was totally ineffective, uninteresting, and half-concocted.
006051048X|5.0|I received the audio CD of Coraline in the mail yesterday in the early afternoon. I'd read the book, and heard parts of it read by the author here and there, so I put it on for background, while I did other things. The \\"other things\\" didn't even get started for roughly three hours.<br /> The recording begins with a verse from a quirky Gothic Archies tune in which Stephin Merritt sing-songs, \\"You are not my mother, and I want to go home,\\" over layers of atmospheric dings and bonga-bongas. The song echoes the story's cohesion of humor and spookiness, and is split into three parts, playing a bit before each of the three CDs.<br /> The story itself is a delight. Coraline is a typical child-explorer, examining the house and grounds to which she recently moved, uncovering the strange personalities that inhabit her world, and discovering that a door in her home which was previously bricked-up actually leads to a misty echo-world where old, hungry, button-eyed creatures masquerade as her other parents, having parent-napped her real parents, while trying to convince her to stay there forever so that they can keep her soul . . . Well. Perhaps her story is not so typical. Not typical, also, are the fantastic characters who pop in and out of the story, such as the Slavic mustached man who lives in the upper flat and is training a mouse circus, and his other-self, or the pair of dotty, but kind, retired theater mavens who read tea leaves and worry about their dogs' tummies, and their less-benevolent, other-world counterparts. Like any true exploration story, Coraline has an assistant for the more dangerous times, in the form of a condescending, snarkily witty black cat. And like every true exploration story, there are acts of great courage and startling discoveries made along the way.<br /> Neil Gaiman is an engaging and expressive reader, as well as writer. He infuses the characters with a spark all their own, changing cadences and even accents, always to the benefit of the story. The pacing is smooth and quick, with minute dips and well-placed pauses that give the shivers a chance to manifest before the story is once again plunging on to the good stuff.<br /> Coraline is a story that begs -- no, demands -- to be read aloud. Usually the problem is that someone has to be the reader, while the listeners get to experience the full effect and thrill of the story. Let the author be the reader, and indulge yourself in the sheer delight of hearing a wonderful story told well.tory.

B000066NW0|5.0|I really love this cd, I think that everyone should go out and buy &quot;Let Go&quot; Aril Lavigne's cd. It's really is a great cd, I love every song on this album, I'm not lying, it really does rock! It's totally worth spending your money on. Avril Lavigne is a really talented 17 years old musician from Napanee,Ontario, and I think everyone will be seeing alot more of her in years to come. So Everyone go and buy her Cd &quot;Let Go&quot; it's an awesome cd, I'm really glad that I bought it.
B000062TU1|5.0|Okay, so some of the reviews are really bad.  I don't care.  I loved it.  I found it delightful and very entertaining.  When the movie came out, there was such an uproar about it corrupting children and that its real purpose was to bring them over to the dark side.  Yeah, right.  I found it to be none of that.  I think it was more about magic than witchcraft and that it had some good lessons in it.  Lessons such as knowing how to choose one's friends instead of being told, whether that friend is part of the popular crowd or not, how to be true to oneself, that love really does conquer all if you have goodness in your heart and that good is always better than evil.  I think for those children who don't like to read, and let's face it, there are plenty, this is a really good movie.  They can still experience the Harry Potter mystic and didn't have to crack a book. However, it may also make them want to go back and read the book in addition to the subsequent books, and whatever encourages children to read is a good thing.  They may even learn a lesson or two. I'm thinking of picking up the other books myself now! ... If you want to be entertained and want a movie you can enjoy as much as your kids, then get it.  I think you may find that you really like it.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|Many a source material have lent themselves quite admirably to the cinematic arts. Think of any successful page-to-screen translation (it'll come to you). Sadly, however, this adaptation of the book of the same name could only leave the viewer wanting rather than entertained or enthralled. Whether it was the leaden pace, the stilted, almost comical dialogue or the complete absence of any discernible direction I cannot say with any degree of certainty, having neither the desire nor the $3.50 to rent this movie. However, I can state with some assurance that as an individual who has experienced far more than his fair share of emotional, physical and financial disappointment that this film, like almost everything that has transpired in my life, would undoubtedly fall far short of even my meager, ever dwindling expections....
B000060P79|5.0|I saw Simple Plan back in March when they opened for Sugar Ray. Before then I had never even heard of the boys! I had asked one of the DJs while i was standing outside waiting to get in \\"who's the opening act?\\" he responded \\"Uhm, these guys called Simple Plan... I dunno, I've been told they are like Hanson or something...\\" Now that i must say i wasn't too excited about. But when I saw them jump out on stage and burst into \\"Worst Day Ever\\" I was jumping up and down and had my bullhorns up in the air! I LOVE SIMPLE PLAN! After that I went out and bought the CD the first day it came out and now its all i listen to! Its a great driving cd, if you've got somewhere to go: pop it in, crank it up, and roll the windows down and ur gonna be cruisin'! I just saw them in concert again last saturday and i'm making plans to see them on the Warped Tour in August... Take it from me... if you get a chance to see these boys live... DO IT! You won't regret it... they rock the house and are some of the nicest guys u'll ever meet! :) ROCK ON SP!
B000060P79|5.0|This has to be the best CD I own... I bought it ASAP and I'll tell you, these guys know their stuff. The music itself is just awesome... but the lyrics just take it to a whole new level! Perfect is just so incredibly heartfelt, just like all their stuff, though I must say, it's the *perfect* song for me! But you've just gotta buy it... it's something that everyone will love.
B00003CXXP|4.0|When watching A.I., one gets the feeling that this is not your everyday conventional movie, and it is definitely not anything like any of Spielberg's other pieces. While his touch is definite in this film, there is nonetheless a darker, more sadistic and cynical feel to this that smells strongly of Stanley Kubrick, of whom this was a pet project for. What is interesting to see in this film is that while Kubrick did not actually direct this film, Spielberg tried to do it Kubrick style -and ended up with a very unusual but unique film that was a mix of both talents. <br />The first half is almost magical and enchanting, and reminded me strongly of another film I love extremely, Edward Scissorhands. In both, the movie flowed along like a fairy tale, but at the same time, you knew that the fairy tale would end. And that is where Edward Scissorhands and A.I. are both unusual. The happily ever after part really comes first, and the obstacles come after, which of course leaves you inevitably with no fairy tale ending as it has already happened. <br />David's quest to find the Blue Fairy and become a real boy is reminiscent of Pinnochio, but is much more sad as we, the audience know that the Blue Fairy cannot exist...or can she? <BR>In fact, David's world seems almost like a sci-fi fairy tale come true -at a first glance that is. Taking a closer look, you will see many wrongs in it, especially with the treatment of the robots at Flesh Fairs -the cruelty there far surpasses most of the cruelty in our [humans] history which is pretty darn bad. His world can seem like a dream come true at first, but can turn around 180 degrees and suddenly become the darkest nightmare you've ever known. <br />All performances were brilliant, and all involved captured the mood of the movie. However, Osment was exceptional in an already ingenious cast, and I personally feel this is one of the most underrated performances of the year. <br />The second half of the movie, on his quest to become a real boy so that his mother will love him, David encounters Gigolo Joe, who decides to help him on his quest. There are several times where the movie seems to end, but starts going again in this section. This second half is somewhat flawed, and while some would say the last thirty minutes ruined the movie, I wouldn't go that far. The introduction of some entirely new characters altogether at this point is startling, and while it was more negative for the movie than positive, it still provided for some interesting &quot;food for thought&quot;. (SPOILER: Yes, I know they weren't aliens) <br />The ending is very open to interpretation however. It is really up to each person to decide for themselves exactly what happened to David. For me however, the last ten minutes were some of the best moments in a movie from 2001, and enraptured me as the tale came to a close. Although fate may not have been kind on David, in that last bittersweet scene before the movie ends, you can almost see in David's eyes that he captured everything that happened that final day into a mosaic of memories imprinted in his mind forever.

B00005JKED|4.0|There are two kinds of movies. Plot driven movies, and character driven movies. Each have their own advantages and disadvantages, but it is usually clear if the movie works because of the characters or the characters work because of the movie. In this case, Training Day is definitely a character driven movie. <br />Because it is a character driven movie, the main characters will be scrutinized by the audiences more than normal, and therefore take more skill to play. Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke have both been scrutinized for their performances in this -and both are definitely up to the standard. <br />More than ever, I was extremely impressed with the performance by Denzel Washington as Alonzo in this movie. The complexities of his character's personality are as many as threads in a tapestry, and each point is played to perfection by him. Alonzo is like a question mark, you never really know if he is as totally corrupt as he seems till at least halfway through the day. Many an actor would not have been able to convey this sense of indecision and especially this type of character well, but Washington has done it, and with a flair and life of his own. Alonzo was truly one of the most interesting characters I have had the pleasure of watching in a long time. <br />Almost as impressive was Hawke's range in this movie as Jake. As a rookie cop with conflicting loyalties who questions the ethics of Alonzo, he puts in a stunning performance as well. <br />The movie was definitely unusual and different from the normal cop movie. Don't expect a beat-em-up movie -this is a crime drama akin more to Soderbergh's Traffic, or Singer's The Usual Suspects than say Brest's Beverly Hills Cop or the Lethal Weapon series. The use of such a short time period (24 hours) as the backdrop was different to say the least, and put the entire movie into a new perspective. <br />In those 24 hours, more happens than you could ever expect to happen in such a short time. Ethics and loyalties are questioned and answers are given before the day ends. Things happen at the beginning of the day that may have a large impact later on. Things that don't seem of much importance earlier are in fact of importance later. <br />This is yet another example of a good script -turned into a great script by improvisation. Washington ad libbed many of his lines, and because of this, they have a much more natural flow to them, and he settles into his character much better. <br />At the end of the day, when all is said and done, it all really comes down to one thing -ethics. Ethics was what started Hoyt on this trip, Hoyt questions certain ethics along the trip, and ethics is what ultimately incites the powerful and thought provoking climax by which time it is clear what sides everyone has taken on this issue. <br />This film may have been directed by Antoine Fuqua, but it isn't his. At the end of the day, one man stole the show in this movie - and that one man without question was Denzel Washington.
0195073401|5.0|It is the best Ph.D Microeconomic Theory textbook today, if an instructor wants to use a textbook for its convenience. Personally, I like its mathematical rigor and material coverage. <br />However, it needs to be substantially enhanced. It is falling behind many new developments in Microeconomics. For example, the coverage on contracts and incentives is very poor. The coverage on IO is weak. It may consider to include some materials from organization theory.<br />The design of the book is very poor. It is too big and too heavy. Such a big and heavy stuff is only welcome in an exercise room. It is just too hard to carry around. Some students slit the book into a few pieces, each containing a few chapters. Why not dvide it into two books, each for one semester?
B00003CY0V|2.0|I saw this movie a couple days ago after everyone was telling me that this movie was awesome - unfortunately, I did not share their views towards the movie. <br />The beginning blew me away literally, and enraptured me for the next 30 minutes or so. Unfortunately, this mind-bending beginning which was one of the best set up scenes I have seen for a movie ultimately disappointed when the rest of the movie did not live up to that standard. While the ending was surprising and a neat touch, there were some unanswered questions that I wished were answered because of that ending. The way they did the ending was like a cheap trick just thrown in to add some more spice, whereas movies like Memento, The Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable set up and build towards their respective endings. Sure Swordfish set up for the ending -but only with one or two quotes randomly thrown in throughout the story, and one scene that gives a small clue. Ultimately, because there was no real set up, there can therefore not be a satisfying pay off -instead, you are left feeling ripped off. Even so, I am still very understanding of these movies that don't have a set up. However, if they do not have a big set up, I would usually want the movie to explain things more properly, which brings me back to my original point. An example of a movie that did not have a big set up but explained things thoroughly at the end instead, would be Abre Los Ojos/Open Your Eyes. <br />The changing time frames were a good touch to add to the suspense and thrill of the movie. While it may ultimately not have been satisfying, it nonetheless kept me consistently entertained throughout. Another qualm I had with it was the overall unrealistic parts, the main one being one in which Stanley finds a way to hack something in 60 seconds. This is rather impossible, as I know from several very good sources on the net - it would at the very, very least take two hours. If they had left that scene with him unable to hack in to the computer, it would provide us with more food for thought so to speak, and make him seem more human than he does appear. Instead, they took the cheap shot, and lost. One more thing to note on the realism point: most hacking is nowhere near as exciting as they made it look in this film. As one reviewer on the net said -hacking is usually done with just simple tools like notepad, etc, but in this movie, they made the hacking programs seem like Macromedia Flash 5 or some kind of game (which I agree with by the way). <br />And the very worst part of the movie came when Halle Berry took it all off. While the part itself was not bad, it was the very pointlessness of the movie which suddenly drove in how cheap and sleazy this movie was. (As they said, she was paid $200 000 just to bare her breasts) Well if she was paid $200 000, they could at least have fit that part into the story somehow. Instead, its just a random scene thrown in to boost up ratings, and because of the sheer randomness of that scene, you're suddenly thrown out of the movie again, and reminded that it is, after all, just another cheap marketing scheme. But worse than any other marketing scheme, this one was implanted into the actual movie itself. <br />While this is ok for cheap thrills and Berry of course, it will ultimately leave you feeling unsatisfied and cheated.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd's new compilation may be the fullest realisation of post-modern art yet to hit the world of rock music. <BR>The essence of the post-modern or &quot;po-mo&quot; movement in the arts is that it doesn't know quite what it is, but it knows what it likes. It's the sort of art that gets created when art-critics get fed up with being critics and start trying to be artists in their own right. They decide on the sort of statement they want to make, then they pick over their own favourite influences extracting a bit here and a bit there to fit the statement. The point is that placing familiar elements in a new context should bring out new truths in service of the artist's own agenda.<br />The weird thing about &quot;Echoes&quot; is that the Floyd never openly declared or traded on their influences. They were simply themselves. To the extent that they had major influences, these were mostly outside rock - in the fields of avant-garde (Cage, Stockhausen), late romantic tone poets (e.g. Bartok), music hall and nursery rhyme. Above all they were sincere. They wrote their lyrics from the heart and aired their joys and sorrows as a band in public. In other words, no band could have been further removed from the cold, calculating, distanced, ironic world of post-modernism. <br />AND YET here are the Floyd now, seeming brazenly to reinvent themselves, to distance themselves from their own creative muse. The approach for &quot;Echoes&quot; seems to have been almost calculatedly to place their most famous songs in a (some have said jarringly) different context. And by taking bits out of seamless concept albums and reintegrating them more or less seamlessly into new surroundings, they are (intentionally or not) making a new, distanced statement. &quot;This is what we were....look how we did this.....see the effect we were aiming for here....see how we changed....&quot; People think they are buying a greatest hits collection - I'm not sure that's what this is about. Half the statement of the original albums was in an album-length flow of ideas. Change that, and you change the meaning. <br />But there's a further level to this. Most of the Floyd's best work, right through from &quot;Piper&quot; to &quot;Bell&quot;, was pure pop music rather than progressive rock in the usual sense. And what made it deep, of course, was the way the cheerful pop flavour was subverted by all those lyrics about obsession and insanity, and all those disturbing sonic undercurrents that have been boosting headphone sales for the last thirty five years. But in a retro project like \\"Echoes\\", how would you go about providing a fresh jarring element - the shock of the unexpected that was always an essential part of listening to the Floyd? How do you give a fresh jolt to jar the perceptions of people who have been listening to some of these tracks every day for 30 years? I would suggest that the Floyd's controversial remixing of some of their most time-honoured compositions has been carried out in precisely that spirit. <br />So does the issue of a Pink Floyd greatest hits album, featuring songs lifted out of context from some of the most seamless concept albums ever released, imply that the concept album is dead? Hardly! I think the chopped-out bits and mixing tricks may be the central conceptual flourish of a new concept album - perhaps the most radical concept album of the band's career. That the concept comes down in the end to nothing more substantial than \\"We Can Be Post-Modern Too!\\" doesn't really matter. And to my own surprise, I think the new album works. It contains most of the Floyd's best tracks and a few others, superbly remastered and at an appealing price. Over time, the new sequencing may even start to take root and yield connections that were not there in the original setting.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I'm an 18-year-old fan of the Harry Potter books and I absolutely loved this movie! I know the movies will never be able to compare to the books, but they are good for what they are. Some people will say that The Lord of the Rings films are more for the mature, older audience but I'd say teenagers and adults can enjoy both movies! I know I did. Some people said that the child actors in the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone movie did not do a good acting job, but I think they did very well. In fact, I believe that the casting was done perfectly...and I hope they don't replace any of these actors for the future films like I heard one rumor claim on the internet. The special effects were superb...I already bought the dvd, and it's great. Even though it looks confusing to get to all the special bonus footage and deleted scenes, you can go to the harrypotter.com website and you will find the instructions on how to make your way to the deleted scenes and bonus footage. The film is pretty faithful to the novel, though of course they had to cut out some parts of the book, mostly due to timing. Did I mention how great the child actors were? Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Tom Felton were all wonderful and kept the film alive and had great chemistry. They're young and this is the first feature film for most of them, so be nice. Chris Columbus did a great job with the directing and I'm sad to learn that he is only going to be directing Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and then he's not going to direct anymore. Oh well, at least he'll still be producing the others. I'm glad Columbus decided to direct the Sorcerer's Stone because he was the one who wanted to be as faithful as possible to the novel. Some directors who wanted to direct these movies wanted to change the story completely...Harry Potter as an American wizard and going to Hollywood High! Now THAT would've totally [messed] up the story. And some directors wanted to cast Haley Joel Osment asHarry Potter. Now as much as I like Osment, he is no Harry Potter. Daniel Radcliffe was a MUCH better choice. I feel sorry for all those people who decided that they hated this movie and are not going to see the others. I know you have your own opinions but this is only the first one. If you've read all the books then you already know the more interesting, more exciting stuff happens in the rest of the books. So you can't really judge the movies until you've seen all of them! The movie did not ruin the books...it made them better. I hope all the movies will make the books better and take you deeper into the story of Harry Potter. Job well done, and I'm highly anticipating the await of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets...can't wait to see Ron and Harry get to Hogwarts in that flying car!:-)
B00000272N|4.0|Anyone's who listened to rock radio for any length of time knows what \\"Man in the Box\\" is.  While it is a good song, there is much, much better on Facelift.  Allow me to draw your attention to such songs as \\"Sea of Sorrow,\\" \\"Love, Hate, Love,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Bleed the Freak.\\"  I've actually set my CD player just play that song over and over multiple times.  I don't really care much for this album's version of \\"We Die Young,\\" however, since the demo version on Nothing Safe is much better.
B000060P79|5.0|No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls by Simple Plan is such an awsome cd!! They've got great sound and kick ass songs. This cd is definately one that you should go out and buy...RIGHT NOW!!

B000066NW0|5.0|A few words that would describe Avril Lavigne is Anything But Ordinary. Whether it be her music or her personal style. Avril's music expresses who she is as a person. Besides the fact that she writes and plays her own music, Avril's lyrics come from the heart. To compare her to another \\"pop\\" artist would be an injustice because Avril is her own person, truly one in a million. I liked her album because its not fake, her lyrics express real emotions from her past. She is very talented and will have a long career to go in my eyes. I also like her style because she is not dressing how others tell her to dress, but she dresses how she feels. She doesn't care if you like her style. If you do not like it you will not like her because all you are going to get is Avril Lavigne.
B000060P79|5.0|If you have \\"NO PADS, NO HELMETS...JUST BALLS\\", you gotta check out this band. This CD is a must for all \\"Punk Rock\\" fans. If you are a Blink 182 Fan, you'll love these guys. Their music gives you a whole new insight on life. They are sure to go to the top. Mark Hoppus, from  Blink 182, is even a back up vocal in one of the songs(\\"I'd Do Anything\\"). If you want to hear a great band, pick up this CD.They ARE NOT one of those \\"One hit wonders.\\" The whole CD is worth it. Check it out for yourself, you won't regret it. I sure didn't. My first time seeing them even hearing them was on Saturday(6-15-02) at a concert. They were so great, after they performed I had to go to their booth and buy the CD and a t-shirt. I even met them, they are great guys too. Pick up the CD... You'll love it. ...
B000066NW0|5.0|hey, i bought the cd the tue it came out. At first the only word i could use to describe it was, \\"Wow\\". It was so amazing. I love the way she totally puts her heart and soul into the lyrics. Theres no guesswork, I LOVE IT! <br />My favorite song on the cd is \\"Too Much To Ask\\", because i've been going through the same thing. Its so crazy...
B000066NW0|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the raddest cd's I've purchased in a really long time.  It's not like every other cd that is out right now.  Avril Lavigne has her own style and expresses HER emotions.  Her music makes you feel something, inspires you to express yourself, and to be proud of it.  This cd is very rad and has not left my side since I purchased it.  I recommend this cd to anyone who is a true music lover!  Rock on!

B00003CXI1|5.0|This is a wonderful must-have for any Harry Potter fan. I enjoyed the extras on the DVD-ROM very much. Most DVDs extras are worthless, but this one's enhance the experience.
B000066NW0|5.0|When I got this cd I wasnt really sure what was going to be on it, I just knew I loved her single &quot;Complicated&quot;, so I purchased it. Now after I listen to the whole cd (which is on cd repeat right at the moment) I love it. She can turn a few words into the most complex and deepest thoughts. Avril is a person of her own, in a way most people would be scared to be, like in her song &quot;anything but ordinary&quot;, she describes that perfectly. This is definately a cd to buy! You *will* love it-everyone else has!
B00004TH7Z|2.0|O.k., let's face it.  Iron Maiden's last great album<BR>was Powerslave.  Since then, it has been a steady<BR>decline.  This album is o.k. at best.  Bruces recent solo<BR>stuff is way better.  There are about 3 average songs<BR>on this.  I guess that's better than nothing, but still sad.<BR>Maybe if they got rid of that tool of a third guitarist,<BR>they could get back to business.<BR>Time to hang it up.
B000066NW0|5.0|Let go, is a well thought out CD for all listeners. That CD is stuck in my CD player and will not come out!!! I listen to it all the time. It's an excellent buy, for an Excellent CD, written by an Excellent artist. The CD features the hit single \\"Complicated\\" as well as \\"Sk8er boi\\" and \\"Losing Grip\\". To sum it up, Avril Lavigne has some excellent songs on her CD and as for some CD's where you only listen to 9 or 10 somgs out of 15, on this CD there is nothingf anybody could dislike, you will find yourselt listening to all 13 songs in your car, and at home! if you have any additional questions, feel free to email me at any time! If you came this far to check out the CD then why not buy it and listen to the music that you will love for the next year or two (or until her new CD comes out...)<BR>          Make the right choice... we've all heard britney before and hey it's a good CD but now, let's take this new artist for a test Drive!!!!
B00005QDW5|4.0|Overall great spacy CD with only one problem.  Brain Damage was not included.  Brain Damage was a great song recorded on the Dark Side of the Moon record and was well mixed with Eclipse.
B000002B7M|5.0|I love this cd, as everyone else seems to do.  It is my favorite all time debut album.  There is but one complaint, though:  the drums are very weak.  Just compare the drums on this album to those on Diary of a Madman, then you will see what I mean.  Great overall album, though.  Strongest songs are &quot;crazy train&quot;(of couse), &quot;i dont know&quot;, &quot;mr crowley&quot;, and &quot;suicide solution&quot;.  If you like this, then I strongly recommend Ozzy's two best albums:  Diary of a Madman and No More Tears.
B000066NW0|5.0|The first time I heard Avril's voice, I knew that she would get somewhere. She has deep lyrics that can inspire you. You feel like you can relate completely to what she is saying in her songs. Her points are clear, the music is great... I have great respect for Avril because of these things. I hope to hear more new material from her soon, because this album absolutely rocks! I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys a great band with a lot of talent and meaningful lyrics.
B00005CDNK|5.0|This album immediately grabbed me the first time I heard it.  No, it doesn't contain some of the magic of ABBA that the previous albums do.  But it does give us a picture of four older superstars who have been through heartache and who have expressed it beautifully in each and every song.  This album contains a huge amount of depth and maturity that ABBA's critics said the group lacked.  And the four bonus tracks even further show the groups disillusionment with the life as a superstar without compromising their artistic expressions.  Some of the melodies are so haunting, and Frida's pureness of voice becomes very prominent in this CD (take, for instance, Like an Angel Passing Through My Room, or I Let the Music Speak).  I think this is one album that she definitely outshines Agnetha (who I loved on the earlier ABBA albums).  If you are a tried and true ABBA fan, then this CD will give you a whole new respect for each of the 4 members and their incredible talents.
B000066NW0|5.0|avril is a very talented and creative song writer. Her Lyrics truly tell of real life and its just a pure pleasure to listen to this CD. Buy this CD, cuz it just plain rocks!! Oh and she's hot too.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|I took my 3-year-old son to see this movie in the theater, mainly because he was afraid of monsters.  I laughed louder than my son throughout the movie, and he got the message all monsters are not bad or mean.  Whenever he would wake up scared, we reminded him about the \\"Monster Movie\\" [as he calls it].  The best I can say is:  My husband even enjoyed the animated, \\"kid movie\\"!
B000066NW0|5.0|Every once and a while an artist of this caliber comes along and blows the competition away. I think this has to be said about avril lavigne. At the age of seventeen she shows more promise than some of the more popular act such as britney spears and christina aguilera. this album picks you up and takes you into her mind. It blows your mind to think that a seventeen year old can write with so much passion and play that good. Her voice is top notch and her writing ability is amazing. i highly recommend this album.
B00000IPAX|2.0|If this album had been billed as a pop album, I might have been inclined to give it a higher rating.  However, Blink bills themselves as punks, which they are sadly not.   All the songs on Dude Ranch (with the possible exception of Adam's Song) are as bubble gum as Britney Spears despite the fact that their authors have tatoos and dyed hair.  Rarely is their a song that is more superficial than \\"What's my Age Again?\\".  Maybe blink will eventually be hailed as great pop artists, however, they will never be in the same leauge as Punk bands like The Clash, The Sex Pistols, Social Distortion, or the Ramones.  In my opinion, they will always be categorized with other bland, no-message pop artists.  A great Punk album \\"Dude Ranch\\" is not.
B00005JKMQ|3.0|I was fairly entertained during parts of the movie, but overall it moves quite slowly and I found myself checking how many minutes had passed (in order to calculate how many there were left!) I agree with those who wrote that it is a very difficult task to try to create a biopic about a man with so many different sides, which separates him a bit from other African-American leaders of his time (Malcolm X, MLK). There's not just his boxing, but also his religious affiliations, his issues with the US government, his womanizing, his relationship with the press (Howard Cosell), etc etc. Will Smith does a pretty good job, but he didn't have much to work with. For learning about Ali, I would recommend &quot;When We Were Kings.&quot; Unless you're 14 and want to get jiggy wid' Will Smith. A lot of the movie could have been cut.
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is great. I would recommend it to everyone I know. I loved it and I'm sure you will too!!
B00000G3Q4|5.0|I watched this for the first time two halloweens ago and watched it that night, then i bought each movie in the series the very next day since I was amazed how much gore they could put on the screen.

0385335482|5.0|I bought Shopaholic on a day that I bought about 5 other books of it's kind (single girl in the big city books).  But this once stood out-  I found myself blushing and having to put the book down to giggle.  I read it in one long day and then read &quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan&quot; the next day.  Although the second isn't as good (similar plot line) I enjoyed it too and read it as quickly.  They are great summer reads!  If you like these books give &quot;Jemina J&quot; and &quot;Mr. Maybe&quot; a try also, they were very funny and light.
B0000399WI|5.0|Frank Darabont wrote the screenplay and directed \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" based on Stephen King's novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\\" which was published in \\"Different Seasons\\". Darabont had worked once before with adapting King's fiction in his film school, award-winning, three year long production of \\"The Woman in the Room\\" -- a movie Stephen King says is one of the ten best fiction-to-movie adaptations ever made. Darabont was best known for directing modern remakes of \\"B\\" movies when he first optioned Shawshank (The Fly and The Blob and the USA television movie Buried Alive).<br />His Shawshank Redemption is the story of a man wrongfully charged with the murder of his wife and her lover, a man sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison, and this man's undying spirit of hope in a place where hopes seems all but lost. Tim Robbins plays this character: Andrew Dufresne. Dufresne's kindness and intelligence help him to make friends with both the prisonkeeps and the prisoners. Morgan Freeman plays Ellis Boyd Redding, \\"Red\\" to his friends, a \\"man who can get you things\\" and Freeman's voice-over narration gives the film both a world-weary and noble sensibility. In one respect, Red is just as intelligent as Dufresne (albeit a kind of \\"street smart\\" intelligence) -- each know how to work within the system. However, Red keeps quiet around authority, whereas Dufresne draws into a more involved (and dangerous) working relationship with the guards and the warden.<br />It is an emotional drama -- one where friendship and kindness rises above cruelty and injustice. Hence, it is kind of \\"romantic\\" in the classical sense; that is, you ain't gonna find any prison in the US where guys are this buddy-buddy. However, this is balanced (in my opinion) by Roger Deakin's masterful cinematography, and the story's ultimate message of hope. I believe Deakins won an Oscar for his work and though the venerable cinematographer's collaboration with the Coen brothers may give you a better understanding of his range -- it is clear in Shawshank that his range is damn well, wide open. If ever you wanted to learn cinematography, Roger Deakins is the man to study. His camera work gives life to scenes that are ostensibly void of life, and his masterful work with black and white, with light and color, is one of the major components that gives Shawshank its powerful psychological tension and brilliance.<br />Bob Gunton plays the sanctimoneous and corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancey Brown turns in a fine performance as the brutal Captain of the Guards, Byron Hadley. I also enjoyed the performance of Brian Libby as the jocular \\"Floyd\\". And several of the scenes with James Whitmore's \\"Brooks Hatlen\\" are heartrenderingly emotional. Noteable also is the Hank-Williams loving \\"Heywood\\" played by William Sadler, and Gil Bellows's first film role as \\"Tommy\\".<br />My two favorite scenes are: 1) the scene with the prisoners drinking beer atop the license plate factory and 2) the final scene, filmed in the US Virgin Islands. These are the images that stay with me the most after viewing this film. They are the scenes where prisoners are made free, and the story rises above existential bleakness. They are colorful and alive, intended to show redemption realized. Altogether \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" may well be my favorite \\"stuck on an island\\" movie because it is the story of hope realized no matter the circumstances. It offers us the possibility of redemption from injustice, futility, and despair. It offers us a story wherein kindness and belief triumph.

0800141660|5.0|I was disappointed to read a recent review that found little to praise in this splendid rendition of Austen's timeless classic.  I agree with &quot;Emily McB&quot; that Emma Thompson did seem a bit too old to be playing a 19 year old, but who could have represented Elinor Dashwood's character more wonderfully?  The greatest thing about this film is that it stayed true to Jane Austen's tone.  In writing the script, Thompson paid reverence to the drama of the story while not forgetting the humor.  If Jane could have made the movie herself, I am certain it would have come close to this.

0738206679|5.0|What do sexually transmitted diseases, the World Wide Web, the electric power grid, Al Queda terrorists, and a cocktail party have in common?  They are all networks.  They conform to surprising mathematical laws which are only now becoming clear.  Albert-Laszlo Barabasi has helped discover some of those laws over just the past five years, and though they are some pretty abstruse mathematics, he has written a clear and interesting guide to them, _Linked: The New Science of Networks_ (Perseus Publishing).  Not only has he attempted in this book to bring the math to non-mathematicians, he has shown why the work is important in down-to-earth applications.<br />It is important for those multitudes who have no taste for math to know that this is not a book full of equations; Barabasi knows that for most of his readers, doing the math is not as important as getting a feel for what the math does.  He explains the basic history of network theory, and then shows how his own work has turned it into a closer model of reality, a model that most of us will recognize.  Networks are all around us, and they are simply not random.  Some of our friends, for instance, are loners, while others seem to know everyone in town.  Some websites, like Google and Amazon, we just cannot avoid clicking on or being referred to, but many others are obscure and you could only find them if someone sent you their addresses.  Barabasi calls these \\"nodes\\" with such an extraordinary number of  links \\"hubs,\\" and he and his students have found laws of networks with hubs, showing such things as how they can continue to function if random nodes are eliminated but they fragment if the hubs are hit. Barabasi is currently doing research to show what intracellular proteins interact with other proteins, and true to form, some of them are hubs of reactions with lots of others.  Finding the hubs of cancerous cells, for instance, and developing ways of taking them out, show enormous promise in the fight against cancer.  And finding the hub terrorists in Al Queda in order to take them out would be the best way to eliminate the network.<br />Barabasi obviously enjoys drawing examples from all over, and because of his ability to link them, his book is a pleasure to read.  He also shows how this type of mathematics is being done, by conference in obscure European locales and by e-mail.  He shows how \\"eureka\\" insights by his students have propelled the new science, and he is full of good stories from a teacher.  In fact, he is a good teacher, and those who follow along here will have reason to be glad to join, if only in the role of isolated nodes, into this network of mathematical thought.er.

0375707972|5.0|Starting in 1958 in Germany, \\"The Reader\\" follows the first-person narrative of 15-year-old Michael Berg, an ill adolescent who has a love affair with a 36-year-old illiterate named Hanna Schmitz. He's perplexed by her moodiness, and, when she suddenly disappears, Michael becomes obsessed with her and his various memories of her.<br />Seven years later, as a law student, Michael is reunited with Hanna; however, not on the best terms. She is on trial with a handful of other SS female guards, all of whom are being tried as war criminals in conjunction with the Nazi concentration camp atrocities during WWII. Although Michael is numb after seeing her again, he is troubled by his present dilemma to try and free her from a life sentence, or allow her to seal her own fate.<br />Once I began \\"The Reader\\", I couldn't put it down and finished it in one day. It was very captivating and well written. The translation from German to English was great, and I'm very pleased this book made it over to the States. If you enjoy brief May-December romantic literature, then I highly recommend \\"The Reader\\". It's a wonderful work of fiction. Also recommended: \\"The Lover\\" by Marguerite Duras.
B00000064G|5.0|Firstly, if you haven't already, buy the album. Go. <br />For the rest, I seem to be preaching to the choir, but its one of the best albums that I've heard. I've listened to it dozens of times, know every note and word, yet it still gives me goosepimples from time to time. Its short, sweet, sad, understated, always pretty. The sound is spare, but Drake manages to fill the space with fantastic acoustic guitar work. Every note hits its mark, the melodies are, again, fantastic. <br />The music is perfect to listen to by yourself, not to wallow in your own emotions, but to experience his. Its a ride that begins with sort of longing love, light melancholy. The first four tracks draw you in. Track 5 provides an instrumental break that begins hopeful, ends resigned and abrupt. After which, the songs get darker, maintaining the same pretty sound, but haunting. The end comes abrupt, much too soon. You'll be left wanting more after every spin.<br />I've read that some reviewers have disparaged the Volkswagon ad. Agreed, the irony is grim, but I'd have thank them for popularizing the song \\"pink moon\\". I, as well as many of the readers of this review, may not have stumbled upon this gem of album otherwise.
B00005R87Q|2.0|The dialogue is horrible, the acting is poor, and the technical flaws are amazing.  The most irritating thing about this movie is it tries to elevate some of the slowest cars on the roads today to not only sportscars, but supercars.  The Honda Civic?  Please.  I love the old Charger, but 900hp?  And it still can't beat the Civic?!  The movie also features floorboards that fly off when the engine is under stress, engines that heal themselves after blowing, and special effects that make 140mph look like the sound barier.  The movie is not without its perks, though, as it was entertaining.  Good looking women are the best feature of the movie, which is ironic because more women will enjoy this movie than car-knowledgable dudes.
B00005OAIE|2.0|The music's decent, some would say good. Points off for cheating. There are too many similarities to Dave Matthews to be coincidental. Watch tapes of the two performing. It reminds me of Belushi and Cocker on Saturday Night Live. Add some brass, a fiddle, and it could be a good tribute band. The Mave Datthews band, Maybe?

0714834491|5.0|Look, I'll make this short, if you have anything to do with visual creativity get this book!     In 532 pages Alan Fletcher presents a cornucopia of visual and semantic ideas.  Expect the unexpected on every 'page'.  The publishers describe this as a 1064 page book but the author, uniquely, makes each spread a page and it is numbered accordingly.    Perhaps page forty-two will give you an idea of what to expect, it shows a sculpture made from 848 knives, forks and spoons, created  by Japanese artist Shigeo Fukuda but when a spotlight shines on it the shadow it creates is clearly a motorbike.    A glorious book for a word in your eye!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie takes your emotions on a fulfilling roller-coaster ride. It makes you wonder, then laugh, then tense in fear, then cry, then put a satisfied smile on your face, only to repeat the process a few more times. It's psychological and philosophical enough to provoke deep thought, which is a lost art if you ask me.<BR>When I finished watching the movie the first time, my first thought was &quot;Watch it again!&quot; The movie gives you just enough to make you satisfied, but holds back just enough to make you think about it for days. One could get lost watching all the extras on the DVD and exploring the website, just to learn more.<BR>The movie is put together so convincingly that it makes you feel like you live with Donnie. You miss the main characters once the movie is over; they become your friends, unlike the artificial characters in most of today's movies and television shows.<BR>Five stars just won't say enough about this movie. Once you have fully enjoyed it, you feel the need to say &quot;Hey! Watch this movie!&quot; to everyone around you. So watch this movie, OK?
1563890119|4.0|I love this series and am slowly acquiring all the books in it.  It's fairly expensive, but, if you like the Sandman series, it's a lot cheaper than buying each individual comic.  This book isn't the best in the series, but it's still very good.  It's not like most comic books.  There's no superhero intent on defeating an evil supervillain for the good of mankind.  A group of magicians want to capture Death but instead capture Dream.  He stays caged for decades, and, when he finally escapes, he has to find his tools (a bag of sand, his helm, and his Dreamstone).  <br />This first book relies too much on guest appearances made by DC characters, but Gaiman does manage to move beyond that by the eighth issue, \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\".  I really enjoyed that issue, which has the first appearance of Death.  She's the reason I started reading the Sandman series.  I'd read The High Cost of Living, and I loved the idea that Death could be a perky goth girl who you could really get to like.  Mike Dringenberg, who does the pencils for the eighth issue, does an excellent version of Sandman and Death.  I don't really like Sam Keith's version of Sandman that much, but his depictions of horrific things, like Hell, are wonderful.  I also liked \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\", in which Dream has to find his bag of sand and is getting help from John Constantine, and \\"24 Hours\\", in which Doctor Destiny has Dream's Dreamstone and is driving the world mad.  I consider both of those issues to be top horror.  It's definitely worth it to get this book.

She has some room to grow lyrically like in one of her song lyrics (I'm not the milk in Cheerios in your spoon) She isn't [mad] like Alanis Morissette, she's not teen beauty queen like Britney Spears. She's looks like the one of the better looking punk rock people in this Gener and her band members fit the picture of rejected members of Sum 41. All in All they make a perfect band with great music.
B000068IEU|5.0|This is a classic. To make the premise simple, 2 girls gets abducted by a small group of criminal types. They rape and murder them, in woods near the one girl's house. The killers end up spending the night in the girls house and the parents discover what has happened. They take their revenge. <BR>If you enjoy these type of revenge tales, like I Spit on Your Grave, Ms. 45, etc, then you can't go wrong with this one. Probably the best brutality is when the mother of the girl takes one guy outside and pleasures him orally, biting down hard and shaking her head back and forth, kinda like a dog playing tug of war with a towel. That's gotta hurt.
