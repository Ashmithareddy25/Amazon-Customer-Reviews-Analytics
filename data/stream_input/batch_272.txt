B000075BFK|5.0|First off, let me say Rest in Peace Tupac Shakur.<br />This album is a collection of unreleased material that he recorded between 1994-1996.<br />Most of the songs have been remixed with different beats (better ones) and have other artists, including Trick Daddy, Nas, and Mya, added to the tracks)<br />Tupac made these songs after getting out of jail and being signed on with Death Row.  It is a lot more agressive with a few exceptions.  Although, this isn't his best work, (some songs are very good), it is good enough to buy.<br />Songs like Still Ballin, When we Ride, and Street Fame are perfect to blast in your car or at home.  Major base, and thugged out lyrics. Really great.<br />Then there are songs like Thugz Mansion, Mamas just a little girl, and My Block which are his more softer side of music. My block is especially good.<br />It is very, very tragic that he died in 1996.  He had so much potential, more than any other artist in our time. We should support his music fully.<br />I would recomend this album, it has a handful of great songs. CD1 is better than CD2 although both have there share of good songs.<br />My favorite picks of songs: (in order)<BR>-Street Fame<BR>-Still Ballin<BR>-When we ride on our Enemies<BR>-Ghetto Star<BR>-My block<BR>-This life I lead<BR>-Watcha gonna do<BR>and more...good CD.
0198534469|5.0|This is one hell of a book. Needham explains the geometrical concept of complex numbers and functions in a highly visual way.<br />Classical concepts that are typically described in &quot;dry&quot; terms come to life in this book. I studied Complex Variable several years ago and only picked this book up out of interest. And, what a joy it turned out to be. If only the various theorems attributed to Cauchy, Winding Numbers, the geometrical meaning of Conformal Mappings and their relevance to solving physical problems like fluid flow and electrodynamics had been explained to me in this way when I had to study this subject! If only.<br />Students of Mathematics are lucky to have this book at their disposal. It makes a fantastic complement to other excellent books like Complex Variables, Introduction and Applications by Ablowitz and Fokas, ISBN: 0521485231<br />I have no doubt that this book will be a classic!
B00007E8V4|3.0|Did you remember the feeling when you listened to Metallica's 'Reload' album for the first time? It was pretty much like listening to their last bad album from the previous year. Well, this is the same scenario: every song sounds like it would fit on Toxicity, and vice versa. There hasn't been one change at all within the band, and their annoying sound is actually getting too much to bear. While it does contain some good songs, including 'I-E-A-I-A-I-O' and 'Streamline,' the rest of the album fails to let you know when songs change.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Murray Street is just Sonic Youth lite. Beck's Sea Change is the dullest thing since sliced blah. Yoshimi is however insanely brilliant. A unique sound, thoughtful lyrical expression & something mysterious about it. Headphones recommended for full multilayered sound absorption. Other reviews can give you the basic idea but I just want to give props in particular to rarely mentioned ALL WE HAVE IS NOW near the end of the album, about meeting up with a future version of yrself, all ethereal bliss. For all the critical praise The Soft Bulletin got I believe Yoshimi takes it further, both more accessible & more odd. Warning: does not contain any loud guitar sounds, if you need them get Hit To Death or Transmissions or the Acid box set. Bless Wayne & co for sharing these fabulous & unforgettable sounds with us. I'm very curious where they can go further after this.
0812550706|5.0|In the futuristic setting of Ender's Game, Earth was in danger of a third invasion of an alien race referred to as the buggers.  Ender Wiggin was a child genius and the last hope for human survival.  Two bugger invasions of Earth had failed, but a third was anticipated to come in the near future, and Earth needed to be ready.  Ender was believed to be the one who could defeat the buggers once and for all.  At the age of six he was separated from his family and sent to an off-world battle school to become the commander that humanity desperately needed, a commander compassionate enough to understand the buggers, intelligent enough to outsmart them and tough enough to destroy them.  Ender had to deal with many internal struggles when he found himself in situations where he knew what he should do, but did what he had to do.  At times he was forced to physically stand up for himself and then later hated himself for doing it.  He was constantly being manipulated even though he was just a child.  Earth needed a savior and Ender's feelings were not of any importance.  Ender Wiggin was a child yet he never had a childhood.<BR> This book is filled with excitement and adventure along with serious personal moral issues.  The character development is excellent and in depth.  The plot is strong and well thought out.  The book provides the reader with entertainment along with significant messages. This book explores many important issues such as; intelligence, hate, manipulation, sacrifice, survival, friendship and love in a way that is both exciting and touching.  The book is an insightful peek into the life of a boy who accomplishes much but understands life too well to be proud of what he is.  This book is highly recommended.
B000075BFK|3.0|As a real 2pac i want to be the first to say that im am soooo disapointed with this CD. 2pac is still as great as he ever was but the beats are wack as hell. Its hard to understand what they were thinking when they choose those wack, commercial, nelly, ja rule(and another wack rapper you can think of)sounding beats. Its hard to really appreciate 2pac when he is rapping over them. and whats up with trick daddy being on the album! There are only a handfull of tracks that sound like something he would have used if he was alive.this is an ok album but it would have been better if they kept the original beats for the tracks
B0000021RB|5.0|CTA (&quot;Chicago 1&quot;) has never received the due it so richly deserves from rock critics. This album is simply one of the best creative efforts of the late 60's, and introduced a sound that has never been duplicated.  This album is in my top ten of all time, though there are tracks I really don't care for (that's how good the good stuff is).<br />To this day I feel the power and magic my friends and I experienced when we first heard &quot;Introduction&quot;. I play this song for my two sons whenever I want them to hear how a truly great band plays together, yet allows the individual to showcase their great talent. &quot;Introduction&quot;, worth the price of the album by itself, remains for me a powerful example of musicians who are at the top of their art.<br />&quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time it Is&quot;, &quot;Beginnings&quot;, &quot;Questions 67&amp;68&quot;, &quot;Listen&quot;, and &quot;I'm a Man&quot; are all great tracks, as evidenced by the early hits from this album.<br />Fans of Chicago in the late 70's and 80's may have never known what a great bass player Peter Cetera was (knowing only his syrupy ballads of that later era).  Robert Lamm on the keyboards and Terry Kath were undeniably the best at their craft in this moment in time.  The brass &quot;section&quot;-Pankow, Parazaider, and Loughnane-characterized the energy of this album.<br />But the most overlooked drummer in rock and roll history, Daniel Seraphine, made the sound complete. Seraphine was the first drummer I ever heard that proved that the drums were a true musical instrument, and not just for keeping the beat. In all my years of following the &quot;best of&quot; lists, his name rarely if ever appears in the list of great drummers. But I can assure you that you will be mesmerized by his playing. He is the best that ever was.<br />&quot;CTA&quot; and &quot;Chicago II&quot; are the best 1-2 albums ever produced.  Own them and listen for a lifetime.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is fantastic. With the soul and emotion of a 50 year old European, this petite young girl puts her all into every song, leaving the listener on the verge of tears. Soft-spoken, yet powerful; raspy, yet meaningful. To add icing to this giant cake, every song is utterly gorgeous and there isn't one worth skipping over. I will never take this out of my CD player.
B000002Q88|4.0|In the Spirit of Things, like its predecessor Power, sees Kansas creating well-crafted pop music rather than their trademark prog.  By prog standards, it simply cannot compare to their other work.  However, this is one of the most compelling pop albums you're likely to hear.  It still amazes me that it never had commercial success.  Song after song is filled with compelling hooks, sound musical sensibility, and great musicianship.  And with that, even here Kansas never descends to mere pop blandness.  The lyrics are fresh and intelligently written.  All in all, a great intelligent pop album.  Don't expect this to be Monolith or Leftoverture, but it has few peers in the pop field.
0316776963|4.0|I'd never heard of David Sedaris before and I bought the book primarily because a favorite teacher of mine was reading it and enjoyed it (thank you, Ms. Knight!) It's fantastic. His humor is right on the mark, his satire is wildly funny, and he catapults you into a meaningless existance - his own life. (That was a joke.) Comparable in humor to Eddie Izzard, cleverness abounding crazily - David Sedaris is amazingly (I am not going to say &quot;gifted&quot;) bestowed with a humor and reach far beyond his self-depracted IQ. He begins the story talking about the trials of his lisp and the general consensus that awaits such a boy, and ends it on a clever note with a hilarial account of his father's stash 'n spoil eating habits. Not for the faint of heart, Me Talk Pretty One Day is a glorious revelation of silly, nonsensical tales of someone too funny for his own good. Recommending this book isn't enough - I encourage it for anyone not too stuffed by morals. ;)
B000001FS3|5.0|The Joshua Tree was 1980s avant-gard at its very best.  It was fresh, innovative, and compelling both musically and lyrically.  What is more (rare in rock music), this album breathes timelessness.  Play it today and it's not retread retro:  it remains a grand accomplishment of a grand musical vision.  One of the greatest recordings ever.
0385503954|4.0|In my opinion, this is the best of his books I have read thus far.  The others are, &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;Enduring love&quot;.  All the qualities that make his writing so distinctive and great are here.  The ability to draw you into a plot. The ability to draw you into the minds of his characters and the dynamics of a situation like few others can.<BR>The one thing I still feel is missing from his books is any kind of real empathy, passion or romance.  One feels as though Mr. McEwan is describing his characters and the happenings with a wonderful capacity to translate all of it into words, but  does so in a very clinical, dry manner.  It all ends up being a little sterile, kind of like novels of the mystery genre, in which gruesome murders are being described without the true horror being felt by anyone reading.<BR>That said I still like his books for what he does have to offer.  And I am sure I will read every last one of them.
0380820846|5.0|I REALLY liked this book. I have read every JQ book, and this one was just as delightful as all the previous. Colin and Penelope are an excellent pair! I won't give any details because I wouldn't want to give too much away, but despite what other reviews might say, this book is definitely a keeper. I have already read it twice!
B00005NWM3|5.0|I don't really listen to ANYTHING in the mainstream these days, whether be it rock, pop, or whatever- of course, I would NEVER in my life listen to ANY pop, but well u know what I mean. Anywayz, Nickelback are one band I do have respect for. Yes, their songs get played a LOT, yes, Chad Kroeger cannot really sing that well, but they're still good- THEY know how to keep guitar-driven rock alive well: and just FYI, they are not new- they have been a band for about 7 years now and have 2 other cds out. <br />The thing that really bugs me about Nickelback being in the mainstream is the same reason that bugs me about why Creed/Puddle of Mudd/3 Doors Down/etc are in the mainstream:<BR>1. Teenyboppers hear their songs on top 40 stations, love them, and instantly think they're \\"hard rockers\\" when they've never even heard of Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains, and they think the lead singer is \\"soooo hot!\\" and act like he's the only thing that matters in the band.<BR>2. Just about everyone who is NOT a teenybopper bashes them for stupid reasons, like \\"their lead singer looks like Jesus!\\" or \\"they're grunge biters!\\"<br />I really do not think this is fair, how bands who try to keep REAL rock alive are bashed by people who listen to pop-punk stuff like Good Charlotte and New Found Glory, which is a far cry from the word ROCK. <br />Ok enough of that, let's get back to this cd:<BR>This one cd I can really listen to all the way through, all the way from Never Again to Good Times Gone, which are probably my 2 favorites on the cd, along with Too Bad, Money Bought, and Woke Up This Morning, and I still like How You Remind Me even though it is now on about 5 \\"Totally Hits\\" cds.<br />So if you like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, or Stone Temple Pilots old-style, give this cd a shot, you'll probably like it.<br />And to all the teenyboppers: Stop saying you're \\"hard rockers\\" just cause you like the songs you hear on your Top 40 stations!!!!<br />To all the bashers: Leave Nickelback alone: At least SOMEONE knows how to keep straight-ahead rock alive, unlike the annoying Godsmack or Puddle of Mudd!<br />P.S.: See Nickelback in concert if u havent already, I've seen em twice, they put on a great show
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album is one of the first Albums that I have ever purchase that actually does the previously released albums Justice! Steal This Album is a great piece to add to any System fan's collection, and I reccomend this to everyone!
B000075BFK|5.0|This album is hot, a slap to all the wanabees Pac, a slap to all the bling bling songs on the radio. This is real Rap, after the faboulous until the end of time they put out this bomb. Check this cd and hear \\"Still ballin\\", hear \\"changed man\\", hear Street fame\\",\\"mama's just a little girl\\", \\"fair xchange\\",\\"thug mansion\\", matter a fact hear all the album. Thats what we call Immortal thug. Expect him like u expect Jesus to come back, expect him.
B00006SFBD|4.0|Opeth is one of those rare bands that can't seem to get it wrong when it comes to musical quality, but this album doesn't quite reach the quality of some of their other albums. While some of this music verges on black metal, often their music sounds symphonic with haunting keyboard melodies, which is typical of the band. They are my favorite metal artists. Each of their songs is very long, (about 10 min. each), but not very repetitive. Although this is not Opeth's best CD (that title would go to Still Life or maybe Blackwater Park), it is close to average. Since it is Opeth, it is better than most music for me. You should definitely check this band out if you haven't heard of them, or if you like any type of metal music. Do yourself a favor and get Still Life or Blackwater Park first, as they are even better than this album.
B000003FD9|4.0|To review a performance of Bach's work always seems like something I should prepare for by getting a musicological degree.  As it is, I have only my ear and my experience and (what is most helpful) other performances of the same piece to go by.  The purpose of this review isn't to prove, then, better or best, but to try to clue others into the specific character of this performance.<br />The Suites for Solo Cello by Bach are exactly that--one performer, and nearly everything possible on the instrument (until composers discovered more tricks for the instrument in the 20th century).  It is six suites, each comprised of six pieces (all various dance forms, though Bach's genius so refines the form that tempo tends to be the only aspect of each dance that is readily obvious).  As compositions, just about all of the pieces are captivating; from a technical aspect I'm told that they are even more amazing still.  (Sometimes Bach arranges contrapuntal phrases so that the cello becomes a one-man chamber orchestra.)  For the dabbler, there is a slight chance that the first prelude of the first suite might be familiar--it has been recorded on all kinds of other instruments, and warrants such a spotlight given its ceaseless charm.  Buried more deeply in the collection, the Allemande from the Suite in C Minor is a literally heart-wrenching piece deserves to stand alongside the much more famous Erbarme Dich from Bach's Saint Matthew Passion.<br />As to the performance itself, one could go on endlessly comparing one performer to another, specific performances to a preferable one somewhere else, or even (in the present case) of Starker's 1992 recording with his four earlier ones.  In fact, I have performances by Ma, Starker, Gendron, Rostropovich, Wispelwey, Bylsma and the one that started it all, Casals.  Naturally, I have a whole labyrinth of preferred performances, and if I really put my mind to it, I could compile a whole collection of the suites by picking and choosing favorite versions from the seven performers.  Short of such quiltwork, the main thing that brings me back again and again to Starker, Rostropovich, Ma and Gendron is the tone of the cello used.  Local differences in performance can be overcome by the richness of the instrument (or, perhaps, differences in quality of recording;  I don't know enough about cellos to distinguish between its live versus its recorded sound quality).<br />In practice, this means I listen either to Starker or Ma (his first recording).  The tone or recording quality for both is rich, sonorous, yummy.  Also, both performers opt for slower tempi overall, which in places lends more stateliness to the pieces or saves them from what sounds like bad taste in faster versions by others.  There are far too many emotional and qualitative changes throughout the Suites to make an overall generalization, but even so, there is a pleasing &quot;thickness&quot; to the performances by Ma and Starker that makes me play their whole sets more often, whereas with others' performance I simply pick out favorite bits.<br />It is also true that I listen to Ma's more than Starker's.  Ma has been accused of too much cerebralness;  in performance, this means that he moves through the pieces with more regularity, less variation.  There is no lack of passion--the music itself brings that out, even in its mathematical precision--it's just of a more restrained nature.  This is not to say that Starker's performance is an unabashed dilation of rubato and flourish without any reserve.  His version of the Allemande mentioned above, though, is a full two minutes longer than Ma's.  That kind of attenuation conveys its own variety of intensity, though for me specifically it drags by comparison to what registers for me as the &quot;perfect&quot; rendition of the piece by Ma.  (The comparison here is an attempt at characterizing the performance overall, rather than insisting that Ma's is better than Starker's.)<br />It is clear that Starker brings an utterly intense musicality to this performance, his fifth recording of the Suites.  Of them, he remarks with candor, &quot;Playing Bach is a never-ending quest for beauty, as well as in some sense, the truth...As the years and decades go by, the understanding grows while the technical means weaken.&quot;  Even without this admission, one can sense it in the music, especially by listening to other recordings.  Where some seem to labor through the first prelude, Starker brings it to life by playing call-and-answer dynamic changes in the repeated phrases (as well as very slightly varying the tempo in each answer). This amazingly simple, effective (and obvious in retrospect) idea is absent from other performances I have; Wispelwey has a suggestion of it.  Elsewhere in Starker, I can hear him reaching but not quite achieving what he's getting at;  it is at these such points that Ma's performance outstrips him.  (One could say that Ma lacks the depth which Starker brings to this recording--Ma, of course, was much younger then, and has since rerecorded the suites--but a relative lack of depth in music this profound still comes out excellently.)<br />I am fairly certain that the sensibility Starker brings to his performance steals every bit of wind out of anything Ma had to offer in his first performance, but if my own knowledge of the architecture and the intricacy of the Suites is not on par with Starker's, then it is difficult to experience in the music.  At the risk of insulting Ma, I'll suggest that his performance is Bach Cello Suites 101, and that their very consistency (listened to at length) is the perfect steppingstone to understanding the much more Baroque labyrinth of Starker's performance.<br />First impressions are hardest to shake in performances of Classical music.  I knew of Ma's performance first and long ago, so it is all the more a testimony to Starker that he can edge up next to my &quot;favorite&quot; version, and even hint at unseating Ma.r brings an utterly intense musicality to this performance, his fifth recording of the Suites.

B0000296SI|1.0|In short, this is a CD for morons. A Greenday CD without the revolutionary attitude, good lyrics, and a good feel. I beg you, buy INSOMNIAC by Greenday, DOOKIE by Greenday, or the best CD there is, NEVERMIND by Nirvana. Don't become a statistic, listening to songs anout what my age is again, buy NEVERMIND or DOOKIE, listen to real music. Please.

B000002OX7|5.0|This CD, is the Who to a tee. They have many, many classic songs on here. I was upset though that they took out some songs from their LP (like \\"Join Together\\" a really great song!!) and not add them onto the CD. But the CD makes up for that by putting extra bonus tracks (like \\"Behind Blue eyes\\" the first take that they were orginally gonna use on their LP) I'll rate the songs 1-10 (10 the highest)<BR>1. Baba O'Riley...10 One of my (and like every other Who fan) favorites song! the instruments in this song are out of this world!... I love Pete and Roger singing it! I love how both of them singing their lines are so excellent!!)<BR>2. Bargain...8 I like this song a lot because Roger does some high notes in the chorus, but i heard this song used in a commerical too many times!!<BR>3. Love Ain't For Keeping...9 I love the guitars and vocal<BR>4. My Wife...9 i LOVE THIS SONG!! i love how john sings!! i love everything about this song except the fact i can't understand what john is singing sometimes. for example i always thought in the beginning john sang, \\"My Wife...\\" but he says, \\"My life\\"..<BR>5. The Song Is Over...7 i do love the lyrics and stuff, but i kinda wish the song would get over soon sometimes<BR>6. Getting In Tune...10 I LOVE this song!! Go Nicky Hopkins on piano!... i love everything about this song!<BR>7. Going Mobile...10 I love this song! I love Pete singing this song too! Its really funny lyrics. \\"Watch the taxman miss me...\\"<BR>8. Behind Blue Eyes...10 Always, always loved this song. Love the wonderful, wonderful lyrics, instruments, how roger sings in this song, the middle part in the song where it gets fast. EVERYTHING!!<BR> 9. Won't Get Fooled Again...8 i do like this song especially Roger's famous scream, but not the length. Baba o' riley was like 5 minutes long but it didn't feel like 5 mins. this song is 8 minutes long and feels longer!!<BR>10. Pure And Easy...9.9 Love this song too, especially the middle where it gets slow and the ending with \\"There once was a note, Listen!\\" But i have heard Pete sing this song and he does kinda sound better singing this song, though Roger is very, very good! maybe a duet??<BR>11. Baby Don't You Do It...8 i like the lyrics and how roger sing very much so! I just wish there were more lyrics<BR>12.

0385495315|5.0|The degree to which Mathematics has influenced the course of history is astounding.  This book provides a highly readable account of the role codes and codebreakers have played throughout history.  It chronicles the development of cryptography from Caesar's time through the World Wars to the massive NSA projects of today...and makes it comprehensible.  An excellent book.
0783241569|3.0|For screenwriter Richard Curtis' follow-up to the unexpected success of Four Weddings and a Funeral, he had to capitalise by importing big name star Julia Roberts.  Whilst he does this, the result is nowhere near as personable as the excellent Four Weddings or the later Bridget Jones' Diary, despite it being probably the best romantic comedy of 1999.  The story has poor bookshop owner William Thacker (Grant) meeting famous actress Anna Scott (Roberts) by accident and them forming a relationship that has to overcome the problem of Anna's celebrity.  Of course, the answer is obvious from the very beginning, although there are enough flourishes and nice touches to make this much well worth seeing for any movie-goer, no matter how cynical.<br />In particular, the supporting cast is a charm (mainly consisting of well-known British TV actors), in particular the wonderful Emma Chambers as William's sister.  Carrying over her performance as Alice in British comedy The Vicar of Dibley, she steals just about every scene she's in.  Of course, it would be impossible to overlook the main performers and Grant is amiable enough doing his typical role as the English fop.  Of course, the real interesting point of note there is that this was the role that rescued him from his ugly public persona at the time.  As for Julia Roberts, she has appropriately enough never looked more beautiful, and puts in a charismatic performance (despite it not being quite as memorable as her tour de force in Erin Brockavich) that in particular shines at the end when she presents William with the choice to be with her or not.  Managing to portray vulnerability she is every bit the luminous actress that the role demands of her.<br />There isn't really much to fault the film for, just the fact that it isn't particularly anything special.  Indeed, it's telling that things are a lot more interesting when we're not focused on the leads' romance.  Especially, what was probably meant as a study of the nature and absurdities of celebrity doesn't really come together.  This has nothing to do with the acting but more the fact that it's difficult to take seriously something that presents itself openly as a fairytale romance.  Or maybe this was the point, but if it's that love can conquer all then it's hardly unconventional.  Still, the vein of wonderful British humour (along with Emma Chambers and Rys Ifans) make this enjoyable and sweet without ever succumbing to sentimentality.  Sure it's no classic but you'll be hard pushed to find something more sweet-natured.
B000002KMV|4.0|This lovely slab of funky pop-rock succeeds in the risque songs like Jack U Off, Sexuality and the sensual ballad Do Me Baby but doesn't do it for me when it comes to politics, as in the title track, Ronnie Talk to Russia or Annie Christian, although these last-mentioned aren't dismal failures either, since they're saved by the beat. The secret of this early period Prince was the urgency in the songs, a type of nervous tension reflected perfectly in the mix of urban styles and his voice. He created and refined a brilliant blend of dance and rock that went down well in both the disco and the lounge. Controversy is not usually highly acclaimed by the critics, but to my ears all the Prince magic is here, and it has aged remarkably well.
B0000029DD|5.0|I had never heard of Jeff Buckley before coming to university, until I borrowed it from a friend.  I instantly loved it and haven't been able to stop playing it since.  There's a wide range of styles here, from the more uptempo So Real to the gentle Lilac Wine, although it's a credit to Buckley's tender vocals (which really are incredibly distinctive and, dare I say, beautiful).  In fact, the album flows so seamlessly that it's not until you've listened a few times that you even begin to notice how different, say Mojo Pin, is from Corpus Christi Carol.  It just isn't an issue.  Buckley moves so effortlessly between styles and suits each one equally well.<br />Grace is an anthemic, catchy number and a credit to Buckley's wonderful songwriting as well as to his voice.  What's even more impressive though is that through carefully choosing cover versions that fit so well with his own music he has created an album that works as a whole so perfectly that you'll find it hard to break off.  Lilac Wine is gorgeously poignant, and the cover of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah is actually better than the original, due in no small part to Buckley's voice.  And if I keep returning time and time again to his vocals then it's understandable, and anyone who is a fan will probably tell you the same; it's just outstanding.  Of course, by highlighting the covers it is in no way to disparage Buckley's own work, and indeed his sense of lyricism is faultless, especially on tracks such as Last Goodbye, although any of the songs here would be a good example.<br />When originally listening to the album I didn't realise that, sadly, Jeff Buckley had died.  Although there is a few posthumous albums it is such a shame that such an obvious talent (and, indeed, I haven't heard a more stunning debut album) is no longer here to continue making good music.  Some may think it unusual that someone who only released one studio album whilst he was alive has achieved such a cult following.  All that I can really say in answer is that if you buy this album then you'll no longer question his following.
B000001Y5J|5.0|A bridge between \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral\\", NIN's \\"Broken\\" could be the outfit's most heavy offering in the entire NIN catalog.  This EP is a true gem and contains not only Nine Inch Nails' heaviest material, but some of they're best.  The Grammy Award winning \\"Wish\\" is worth owning \\"Broken\\" alone; the full throttle guitar riff is a blend of metal and industrial carnage, but it is undeniably catchy.  \\"Happiness In Slavery\\" is another one of NIN's best songs (check out the creeped out video on NIN's \\"Closure\\" home video), while \\"Help Me I Am In Hell\\" and \\"Gave Up\\" nicely round out this EP.  But it's not over yet; track 98 starts a cover of Adam Ant's \\"Physical\\", followed by concert staple \\"Suck\\".  All in all, \\"Broken\\" is a true gem, and is essential for any NIN fan.
B00003CXXI|5.0|I did not watch this movie because it was a \\"kids\\" movie and this morning I popped it in and could not stop watching. I thought I would just watch a few minutes--I didn't leave the room for even one second. I had to see what was going to happen next.<BR>Shrek was so lovable and the princess was not your normal princess. She was rough and tough. I was shocked when she turned into an Ogre. That was the LAST thing I would have expected to happen!!!!<BR>The short \\"king\\" was hilarious!!!<BR>And I really enjoyed the fire breathing dragon falling in love with the donkey. Who would have thought........<BR>Go see this movie--buy this movie--ENJOY!!!!!!!!!
B00006F7S4|1.0|Beck's family must have been hit by a bus, and his woman left him, and his dog died, all in the same week... because this is some seriously depressing material. No spunk, no life, and very little creativity. Of course with Beck, you are going to hear some unique twinges of brilliance, even on a mood album like this... but I'm telling you... this is not Beck as you know him, not at all. This is Beck on heroin in a pool of depression. Until now, I have loved ALL of his material, this makes me want to cry for a bit, and then go to sleep. I fail to see the genius in this one. Hopefully he has a &quot;real&quot; release in the works that will be soon to follow this misery.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I have seen hundreds of movies, they are my life, I own 60 DVD's and almost 100 VHS's. And after watching all of them I can definitely say that A.I. is what i think to be the best movie ever made. The stroy is so complex and clever. Nothing is left undone, it's perfect. A lot of people say that they hated it but a lot of Americans are stupid and close-minded. They want everything given to them on a silver platter. They don't want to think about the movie or think about its messages. It is perfectly acted and looks great. SEE IT!!! My other faves are Mulholland Drive (or anything by David Lynch), The Game, American Beauty, Princess Mononoke, and tons more.
B000062Y98|4.0|this is the first blind guardian album i have bought.  before this all i knew was the cover of \\"beyond the realms of death\\" which was originally a judas preist song.  well i am glad i got it.  it is a powerful vocal album.  there has to be like 6 different vocal tracks atleast.  that can be nice but it can be annoying.  the last track would be nice if it had a english translation to it.  the first track precious jeruselem is a quality song that uses vocal layers with good taste.   with a name like \\"a night at the opera\\" some of the vocals do sound like theatrical songs.  with that said i would highly reccomend this album if you like the power metal genre and the high pitched vocals with many vocal layers.  i look forward to getting other albums by them.
B00006FXB6|3.0|the songs are good enough, but the whole thing of making it sound like you are listening to a radio station is really annoying.  i wish they had left off the useless DVD and put another CD in with just the songs. I am going to rip the CD and edit the tracks to take that junk off.  In general, I just don't think this band is as good as Kyuss.  It is good music, but just a little on the one dimensional side.
B000068TPN|5.0|War is comprised of battles in which people live or die, are brave or too frightened to act, give or take.  <br />The battlefield in We Were Soldiers is realistic.  There is confusion -- troops run toward an enemy when they should stop and think in the very literal heat of battle.  The depth of this story is in revealing the fellowship between warriors -- ultimately a soldier fights for his men.  <br />Viet Nam was an unpopular war, but the men and women who fought, lost their innocence, gave all they could, are the heroes. They deserve honor -- political issues do not enter the chain of command, but the knowledge of those in the war zones must be heard. <br />This is an excellent movie.  Lt. Col. Hal Moore (played by Mel Gibson) is in conflict with himself, but he follows orders.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|Now, when will they release a DVD of their early videos? Especially &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;? Regardless, this is a fine album. I had not listened to it for a long time, because I only had it on vinyl and my has been in storage for a long time (not by choice).<br />Also, ignore the pointless bad rating because the reviewer could not figure out how to install Quicktime software on his Windows system. Giving this ALBUM a bad rating because of his technical ineptitude is wrong. Do not hesitate to get this, especially if you are a fan. Nice job.
0425173755|5.0|\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" By Agatha Christie<BR>   The book I read was \\"Murder on the Orient Express.\\"  I liked this book a lot.  It is very suspensful and kept me at the edge of my seat most of the time.  I love the way Agatha Christie writes.  She makes her stories so good that you cannot put the book down until you finish it.  This is one of the good books written by Agatha Christie and is enjoyed by people from all over.  <BR>   I liked the book and enjoyed reading it, because Agatha Christie writes books so well.  When she made Hercule Poirot the main character,it made the book even better.  I love the way he solves mysteries and the way he asks questions.  He is so good at asking questions that he gets the person he is talking to, to answer the question correctly.  He is also very good at solving mysteries and is correct in his guess in the end.  I like the way M. Poirot speaks.  Agatha Christie writes so well that you could hear his accent when you read the book.  In the book he said some things that made it seem like you could hear him talking.  Here are some quotes: \\"You are, I think, a little bit contemptuous of the way I prosecute my inquirities,\\" he said with a twinkle.This is on page 146.  Poirot emergered \\"Nothing,\\" he said.  \\"Not even a compromising bequest!\\"  This is on page 187.  \\"I like to see an angry Englishman,\\" said Poirot.  \\"They are very amusing.  The more emotional they feel the less command they have of language.\\"  This is on page 232.  <BR>   The main theme of the book is: \\"If someone jumps over the bridge, would you jump too?\\"  The theme is saying, just because someone committed a murder, it does not mean you have to go and kill them back.  You should not go so low and be just like the criminal.  Then, you too, will become the criminal.  One person was going to kill Mr. Ratchett, but then he called more people and they all listened to him.  They should not follow the person if they believed it was not the right decision to make.  Another theme is: \\"You should not get revenge for your hate.\\"  This means hate is the reason people want to get revenge.  The last theme is: \\"Hate can come back and haunt you.\\"  Mr. Ratchett killed someone from hate, and the hate came back and killed him.  I do agree with the main theme.  It is very true and people should believe in their heart and not do what other people tell them.  Also, I agree with the other themes they are also true.  <BR>   I would recommend the book to others, because it is such a good book.  I had a fun time reading it.  It teaches you about life and to be a good person.  People should not tell lies, like the characters in the book or they will be caught in the end.  It is so mysterious and a book everyone will have fun reading.  If you like mysteries, this is a good book to read.  Each page is filled with clues to find out who the murderer is.  Can you catch them before it is too late?   <br />          557 words.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I just want to keep it short.  This album is awesome.  I actually enjoy it much more than Toxicity.  If you enjoyed Toxicity then this album is for you, period.
B00007E8V4|5.0|any s.o.a.d fan without this cd is being deprived of some of the best works of music i`ve heard.<BR>the best tracks are:<br />F**k the system<BR>Snowblind<br />You get where i`m going with this.
B00005A0V0|4.0|Well this album, expecially the 22 minute suite (too much long and sometimes boring)&quot;Nine feet underground&quot;, has characterized the light Canterbury sound of a fascinating epoque for a long time (listen also to &quot;Moonmadness&quot; by Camel and, above all, to Rousseau &quot;Retreat&quot;, this german band being inspired by first Camel and classic light Canterbury very much, sometimes improving the easy canterburian sound). But actually if you listen to tracks like &quot;Lunar sea&quot; and &quot;the spirit of the water&quot; by Camel or the albums by Hatfield and the north, these latter being more experimental, you can skip &quot;In the land of...&quot; by Caravan!! However, despite of their importance, this work isn't always inpired (listen to the forgettable &quot;Love to love you&quot; or to &quot;Golf girl&quot;, where the crepuscolar tones of Sinclair's voice are boring!!); and for this reason the right rate should be 3 stars (I add 1 star because this work is influential)<br />Recommended to the fans of Light Canterbury, but before check &quot;Moonmadness&quot; by Camel and Rousseau &quot;Retreat&quot;
B000003S0P|5.0|This is King Crimson's best for the simple reason that it has the most complete song, a culmination of KC's musical development until then, that song being, of course, &quot;Starless.&quot; Also, this KC group is the best, John Wetton is probably the third best KC vocalist, after Greg Lake (of ELP fame) and Adrian Belew. Excellent percussion by Bruford, and by David Cross on violin. And of course, Ian McDonald on sax was absolutely essential for &quot;Starless.&quot;<br />Beginning with Lark's Tongue in Aspic [LTiA] and continuing with Starless and Bible Black [SaBB] (a &quot;live&quot; recording with the audience blocked out in the recording), &quot;Red&quot; gives us the improv/jamming, strong experimentalism, the heavier rock sound, all in one. SaBB was strong in terms of the improv, and LTiA was strong in terms of the experimentalism. Red improves on both by bringing all of these elements together in one, and at the same time giving us &quot;better&quot; songs to listen to (more accessible without losing the KC edge and sounding plain). <br />When I think of King Crimson, it is not just the experimentalism that makes them stand out as a prog rock band. Being something of a jazz fan, I also enjoyed the way their ability to jam developed over time, how the members encourage each other to carry the music to new heights. &quot;Red&quot; is where all of this comes together. After &quot;Red&quot; KC come out with &quot;Discipline,&quot; which I also enjoy very much. But after the disbanding of LTiA-SaBB-Red period KC, they sound decidedly ordinary (still great rock music, mind you, but ordinary by KC standards). <br />In sum, &quot;Red&quot; is a great work of progressive rock that will never grow old!
B00005JKDQ|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS WAS GREAT &amp; THE LITTLE GIRL WAS SUCH A DARLING,BEST OF ALL THERE WAS NO VIOLENCE OR PROFANITY.IT GIVES AN UNDERSTANDING TO THE OLD CHILDHOOD FEAR THAT WE ALL ONCE EXPERIENCED &amp; HELPS CHILDREN TO SEE IT IN A FUNNY WAY, RATHER THAN THE FEAR OF THINKING THAT THERE ARE CREEPY SCARY MONSTERS UNDER THEIR BED. MY CHILDREN LOVED IT!
B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD grows on you more everday.  I love it and have shared it with several other people who have become big fans as well!!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I bought this cd after hearing \\"Don't Let me Get Me\\" and loving that song. Other faves are Respect, Get the Party Started, 18 Wheeler, Lonely Girl, Numb what am I saying I LOVE all the songs. A Awesome cd I loved it so much I bought her previous cd which wasn't too bad either. A great talent!!!!
079213690X|5.0|What can you say about a movie that was nearly perfect.  Right from the beginning you get a feeling for who exactly William Wallace is.  Seeing how the Scots were persecuted by the English was upsetting.  Even more upsetting because it happened.  It's hard to understand that one person could do so much just to get freedom for his people.  There's even a bit of romance in this movie for that added touch.  I guarantee you'll love this movie.
B000066NW0|4.0|I have to say I was very undecided about buying this cd even though I liked Complicated well enough but I have to say it was so over-played on the radio. However I was definitely surprised what a great talent. I really enjoy this cd along with Complicated other great songs are: Anything but Ordinary (probably my most favorite song), Mobile, My World, Unwanted and I'm with you. She's not your run of the mill teen singer she's got talent and can write her own stuff!!!
B00003CXTF|2.0|I don't know how I got through life not knowing anything about Pearl Harbor, but I did.  The movie was informative but not really all that good.  There was a lot in this movie that could have been left out.  The characters were a little boring and the story dragged on.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album. I pop it on and listen to every single song don't skip any which is so rare as usually there will be a couple songs you are so so but not this one. It's awesome one of my favorite cd's this year. It's actually the best cd they have done much much better then the last one. This cd and Pink's are my top cds of the year!!!
0792151712|5.0|There's not much to say about this movie except that it was absolutely brilliant!!  This is one of the best movies ever made.  The story of the Titanic always differs from what source you look at.  It was great to finally have all the pieces brought together in a movie.  All of the characters were well portrayed and the design of the ship was stunning.  This is one movie to add to your collection.
0786915749|5.0|I have read this series three times now, and every time I read this book, it simply draws me into the DragonLance universe making me want to hurry and finish so I can get to the next one!<br />Read it! I am sure it will do the same for you!
068487217X|5.0|This is one of the best books I ever read.  Right from the beginning I was laughing.. then crying and repeating that throughout the whole book.<br />I guarantee you'll laugh out loud many times, especially if you are/were a Catholic.  The &quot;Holy Toast&quot; had me laughing for quite a while.<br />Sometimes it's hard to imagine a life as difficult as what he lived.  Having nothing to eat, or eating a sheeps head for dinner.  The living conditions I think were almost worse.  Bug filled beds, flooded houses or living behind a communal loo.  This is one of the few books that I can read more than once and still enjoy it as much as the first time.
B0000640VN|5.0|Kate &amp; Leopold is one of the funniest, and most charming movies I have ever seen.  I found myself being completely jeolous of Kate and her new find, and admired the sheer originality and genious of the story.  Every descent girl dreams of a Gentleman in the purest form, and &quot;Leo&quot; is that perfect gentleman.  It's funny, charming and witty - definately a kepper!
B00006F7S4|1.0|I'm going to the local CD xchange and trade this dud in for $2 credit. I find the monotony on this CD numbing. For some good sad stuff try James Mcmurtry's \\"Where'd You Hide the Body\\" or the Cowyboy Junkies' \\"The Trinity Session\\" or \\"Lay It Down\\"
B000065V1V|4.0|I won't claim that it's been 24/7 since I bought the CD (months ago), but in three or four &quot;stuffings&quot; in the player, it is difficult for me to listen to something else (unless it's &quot;Outside&quot;!).  The harmonics, lyricism and Tony V's signature polish add up to an infectiously addictive album.<br />I largely agree with the other reviewers, but am curious that no one else has mentioned Carlos Alomar's JAMMIN' contributions.  Reportedly brought in at the last minute to contribute overlays and dub-ins, Carlos ROCKS, and his musicianship brightens the album's glow. His innate understanding of, and augmentation to, Bowie's &quot;feel&quot; make this David's best release in YEARS.<br />Yes, I do &quot;save&quot; five stars for only the epic...
B00003CXI0|5.0|<br /> HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is a well-known movie in the world now. This is the story of a young boy named Harry Potter, who is a wizard. When he was a baby, Voldemort killed his parents. So, he was living at his uncle's house. His uncle and aunt are very bad people. Harry is a kind of Cinderella. At first, he didn't know that he was a wizard. But he went to Hogwarts, a magical school, by a strange coincidence. That day was his 11th birthday. He has some friends there. Their names are Hermione and Ron. <BR><br /> At the end of the movie, they had to play chess. They each took the part of chessmen. Ron was injured so Harry could get the sorcerer's stone. After that, Voldemort wanted to kill Harry and take the sorcerer's stone. So, they fought each other. Harry won the battle. But he was injured, too. After he recovered, he returned to his uncle's house.<BR><br />I didn't learn anything from this movie. I was just excited when I watched it. But I love this story because I have never watched magical stories before. This story is very interesting! Now we can watch Harry Potter's second story in the theater. It will be interesting!
0066214122|5.0|I read this book in only four hours.  It is one of the most tense and horrifying techno-thrillers that I've read yet.  Put down whatever book you are reading and pick this one up.  You won't be able to stop yourself!
B000002H33|5.0|Master Of Puppets is one of metallicas best albums ever its way better than the stuff that is one some of their newer albums especially Load.The solos on puppets are amazing <br />this albums great.I could write pages about it but i wont bore you.If you are a new Metallica fan buy puppets you will love it.Great solos we all wish Metallicas new stuff was more like this.
6305165912|5.0|I thought I was the only one that noticed the 9/11/91 check detail... I've seen this movie a thousand times &amp; still laugh. Not for the easily offended..This movie is hysterical!
0446608955|5.0|First I thought: Yeah, another remake of &quot;Love Story&quot; - but I was wrong. This is a hundred times better...  <BR>I was quite weary, and the book stood untouched on a shelf for a long time before I finally opened it. I was immediately enthralled... I loved the characters and got very attached to them. And as the story went on, I kept asking &quot;Why, why why?&quot; -  I was truly grieving for Landon and Jamie.<BR>This is a stunning romance with lots of messages for the heart and soul. If I could have given it 6 stars, I would have. Do read it, I beg you. But have a box of tissues ready.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I have to respect that a number of people whose taste I trust loved this, but, my God did it give me a headache.  It was similar to being subjected to a strobe light for 2 hours.  Was this a musical for the attention span deficiant, or an attempt to recreate a 19th century acid flashback?  I guess that my zero tolerence for the &quot;art form&quot; of the musical may have pre-disposed me to loathing this.  Nonetheless, ugh.
0066214122|5.0|I bought this book at around 6:00pm and finished it at 12:30pm.  I COULD NOT put it down.  Crichton is in fine form as always, and makes a number of difficult fields (nanotech, intellegent computer systems) very accesable.  Impress your friends by talking intellegently about convergent technologies!  Plus I'm afraid to turn off the lights for fear of...
B000002J5K|5.0|Time has been kind to the original Blues Brothers film.  Lambasted by critics, but embraced by SNL fans and R&B lovers.  The musical comedy is one that I have never grown tired of, and I played out my original LP and CD to death.  The remastered CD brought this music back to life.<br />It is a testament to the conviction of Jon Landis, and especially to Dan Ackroyd and John Belushi, that they were able to re-immortalize Blues, R&B and Soul legends Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway and (on film only, unfortunately) John Lee Hooker, by introducing them to people who had no idea who they were, and reminding fans of the past how good these people were, and continued to be.<br />Aretha Franklin acknowledged she was grateful to them for re-vitalizing her career.  It is a worthy testament.  Every appearance by these greats is a show-stopping number, and for me a personal favorite of Jake & Elwood is Sweet Home Chicago, a nod to Blues legend Robert Johnson, who influenced so many with his short body of work.<br />Paul Schaeffer's musical direction is outstanding (He was unable to appear in the film due to his commmitment to Gilda Radner's stage show), and personally I believe he peaked here, becoming a parody of himself as bandleader for David Letterman.<br />Those who don't 'get' the album should really listen to the roots of what made the Blues Brothers happen - check out the Atlantic Rhythm & Blues CD set, and the Stax Records set to get an understanding of some of the more 'contemporary' influences that drove Ackroyd & Belushi to build the band and even use original Stax musicians Steve Cropper and Donald 'Duck' Dunn at the core of the band's rhythm section.<br />The Blues Brothers 2000 film may be a letdown to those who saw it, but the original (and its soundtrack) are tributes to hard driving soul and R&B, and one can't help but enjoy the musical journey.
0553277472|5.0|It seems as though many of the people who have recently reviewed this book missed much of what makes this book great - fascinating philosophic discussion and an interesting story. To really appreciate the depth of this book one should have at least the faintest of notions about the general movements in Ancient and Modern philosophy. While doubtless many will find such discussions boring, which is a sorry state of affairs to begin with, what makes this book excel is that it's not a traditional philosophic treatise - it has a storyline component as well. <br /> As a book of considerable depth and well-written fiction, it stands as one of the best books I've ever read. Certainly it's not a book to breeze through, instead, it should be read slowly with contemplation. If you're looking for a quick, shallow read please go elsewhere. If you're looking for an intellectually stimulating read that discussions issues from Hume's skepticism, Aristotle and Plato, and Eastern monism, then you've come to the right place.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age hits hard fast and frequent.Their music is Raw, Melodic, Hypnotic, and Brutal. The guitar riffs are like nothing I've heard in a long, long time. The Bassist could beat the Hell out of Flea(RHCP's). This Band has it all.
B00005QIPH|5.0|WOAH...And I repeat: WOAH. This band is nothing less than the ultimate definition of music. Every single track, and I mean EVERY SINGLE TRACK is so different and new and the melodies intricate and raw GENIUS that it's really impossible to find any cracks in the album. I basically listen to this CD 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, because it NEVER gets old. With metaphorical lyric-filled songs such as \\"Soma\\" and \\"New York City Cops\\" which are tinged with a slight gritty/down-and-dirty quality to the notes, IS THIS IT is possibly, no definitely, the greatest album of all time. I only wish I'd found this music sooner than I did! Because THIS IS IT!!! Go STROKES!!!<br />Ok and anybody who doesnt like this album obviously has an impaired taste for good music.  IS THIS IT is original, both rich with  melody and laced with underlying, hard-core bass.    Once again, bravo.
B00007BHOE|1.0|this is slipknots worst video ever<br />plese do not buy it!
B000002AVF|5.0|This is the first mainstream CD I bought and it's still one of the best albums ever made, even after all these years.  &quot;Fantasy&quot; is just a fun song with great lyrics and even with a sampling, it's still a tight track.  &quot;Underneath the Stars&quot; tells of young love and it's so innocent sounding but also wanting too.  &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, still the best duet/collaboration ever done in music, utilizes the vocal talents of Boyz II Men and the lyrics are just heartwrenching but it's a song that no one could ever say is a bad song by any means.  &quot;Open Arms&quot; is a remake on an older song but Mariah's vocal talent soars on this song and she actually outdoes the original version.  &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; is not one of my fav songs by her but it's still a wonderful song that's light and fun.  &quot;Free&quot; goes back to the gospel roots that make Mariah amazing and showcase her entire octave range while the lyrics truly are about emerging with freedom.  &quot;When I Saw You&quot; is one of the best songs ever recorded even though it never made it to the radio waves or became a single, this song will touch anyone's heart and is an experience everyone goes through (I still hear tons and tons of people play this song).  &quot;Long Ago&quot; heads more towards a stronger R&amp;B but the lyrics are great on this song as well while &quot;Melt Away&quot; is another good ballad song but not the best on the album.  &quot;Forever&quot; is a remake on another song but man does Mariah make it soar and show the passion in it....absolutely a gem.  &quot;Daydream Interlude&quot; becomes something that Mariah soon puts on her following CDs, an interlude before the final track and the interlude seems introspective and provides a segway for the last track. &quot;Outside&quot; has a beautiful music background but the lyrics are so profound...it's easy to see Mariah like this or even myself because they are so deep and vulnerable...a wonderful end to an excellent CD.  This CD still remains my favorite Mariah CD but more than that, it's a CD full of songs for everyone and it's a very deep lyrical album that fuses passion and beauty all at once.
0060536969|4.0|I read the book over a matter of two days. It is a very interesting and fast read. I've always been a huge fan of crichton and had eagerly awaited the release of his latest. I was also eager once I heard the film rights had already been purchased.<BR>Now to the novel. Amazingly fast. The story jumps into gear and doesnt stop. It seems to be a mystery novel at first then switches gears and heads into the sci fi adventure style of crichton. Its written in first person and to me that is the only thing I didnt like. But that is just my personal oppinion, Iwould have loved the story had it had multiple points of view. It would have been nice to get to know the other charachters. Though seeing though the eyes of JAck was interesting also.  but he created a great slew of charachters alongside him, why not use them. to me it kind of downplays the suspense...usually always the story teller survives.<BR>As for the story and suspense, great.I was drawn in..felt like I was part of it. The swarms are terrifying..and I wish there had been more about their creation. The pace was very very fast...<BR>The end even seemed to happen too quickly but was satisfying. Unlike his other books I think that this may make the best movie as there seems to be less to translate.<BR>All in all it isnt my favorite of his work. It didnt explain the technology as well as TIMELINE nor have the charachterization elements of SPHERE but was still very suspensefull and the pace was the fastest of all his books. <br />Though this review, on a second reading, seems unsatisfied partly. I did enjoy the book and I will be reading it again. And believe me Im already eagerly awaiting his next release.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Ok, ok, I know the new album is out but I'm still addicted to Play cause it's just that good!  The CD mixes the elements of electronic but also seems to shy away from being just straight bass every song.  \\"Honey\\" opens the CD as a strong and good track followed by \\"Find My Baby\\" and the ever popular \\"Porcelain\\" made popular by the trailer for The Beach.  \\"Porcelain\\" also remains a key song on the album because it just intoxicates you and wisks you away.  \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad\\" is another landmark track with passion in the lyrics shown in the increase of the music intensity.  \\"Southside\\" is an awesome track and with Gwen Stefani on the later issues, it just makes the song even stronger though it's not the best track on the CD.  \\"Rushing\\", also made popular on the trailer for Unfaithful, is probably one of my favorite tracks because it just rushes over you and definately was appropriate for Unfaithful for more than one reason that Amazon prohibits me from saying in a review since you all know.  \\"Bodyrock\\" and \\"Natural Blues\\" are good tracks on the album but seem mediocre in comparision to the first set of tracks.  \\"Machete\\" picks up a techno/speed metal sound almost at some parts but it's amazing and \\"7\\" is just so strange but grabs your attention definately.  Oooh, \\"Run On\\", interesting track that seems almost simplistic but almost reminds me of something from the 50s happy times but it's twisted more if that makes sense.  \\"Down Slow\\" is a great song to relax to and one of my favs as well and is proceeded by the track \\"If Things Were Perfect\\", a track that disappointed me on the album.  \\"Everloving\\" adds in the acoustic elements while \\"Inside\\" makes you feel like you are flying or just at peace...amazing masterpiece song.  \\"Guitar, Flute, and String\\" sounds sad but good at the same time and \\"Sky Is Broken\\" almost seems out of place at the end of the album surrounded by the songs it is.  \\"My Weakness\\" ends the CD and it's just beautiful...children playing inthe background at the beginning, choirs singing, and then a piano lightly enters in but creates rhythm, sadness, everything that might come from a memory arising.  Play was a breakthrough album when it came out and even with his new release, this album still remains the best of Moby and probably the best of all electronica CDs (even though this CD really is in a class of its own).
B000070WJE|1.0|Robbie Williams is a showman, he puts on a great show, and his two previous albums were great music. This album doesnt<BR>have a song that radio or the public will like. Sexed Up is embrassing and im not sure what hes trying to say. Feel is a song<BR>that I guess Robbie thought would get huge airplay and become the hit that will break him into the USA market. It wont! The album is a mixture of fast and slow songs, it will not win him any new<BR>fans and might end up losing him some.
B000002BQK|4.0|Following a divorce and other things in her personal life, Mariah arises again with another fantastic album to follow up her hugely successful Daydream.  Butterfly shows Mariah's flight to independent life now and the lyrics are very upbeat but also very passionate.  \\"Honey\\" begins the album off and it's a fun song to dance too but the sexy lyrics and singing make it an instant hit and a song that's great to have in your head.  \\"Butterfly\\", yet another best song recorded by Mariah, has such strong lyrics and seems like a butterfly from cocoon and emerging from there as beautiful and independent (the video is also one of the prettiest videos ever done).  \\"My All\\" is a song that's very seductive and passionate about wanting someone so much and it's also a very steamy video too.  \\"The Roof\\" is a racey song (probably one of the raciest Mariah has ever done) and is so seductive and filled with want and lust...but it's still an amazing track.  \\"Fourth of July\\" is fashioned like \\"Underneath the Stars\\" but this one is more explicit but it's a great song still (I hope I have a Fourth of July like this sometime).  \\"Breakdown\\" featuring Bone Thugs is a song with awesome lyrics and the rapping makes it all the better.  \\"Babydoll\\" is not as innocent as its title but still a song that should have been a hit and remains a very good song.  \\"Close My Eyes\\" talks about growing up too fast, the things you miss if you go too fast in life and don't enjoy youth but very introspective too.  \\"Whenever You Call\\" first appeared as a solo song by Mariah and it's so strong lyrically and something I love to sing but it's obvious why it became such a hit (even as a duet with Brian McKnight).  \\"Fly Away\\" is yet another interlude towards the end of the album that becomes characteristic of Mariah but is a great break on the CD.  \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" recorded with Prince is probably my least favorite song on the entire album.  \\"Outside\\" is a good track to end with on the album though it's also not the strongest either.  Butterfly is probably the darkest and most seductive album by Mariah but it's a great addition to have and an amazing CD that the young won't grasp but with age becomes an even better album.
B000068FUM|5.0|There's not much I can add to the numerous rapturous reviews of this album by other listeners, other than an emphatic &quot;I agree!&quot; I would note for the record that I was not immediately blown away by this disc, but as at least one reviewer noted, you owe it to yourself to listen to it five or six times to truly appreciate the great harmonies, jangling guitars and overall excellence of this CD. It just grows on you. &quot;I'd Run Away,&quot; &quot;Real Light,&quot; and &quot;Pray For Me&quot; are awesome, as is their cover of Grand Funk's &quot;Bad Time,&quot; which I like even better than the original. A great album.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Some people take issue with a band like Pink Floyd putting out a Greatest Hits, but the simple truth is this: very few people know about Pink Floyd during the Syd Barrett era, when arguably they were better than they were during the 1970s.  Here, five of his best songs are collected, including the superb &quot;See Emily Play&quot;.  While they tend to focus too much on the later material (really, are all those cuts from &quot;The Division Bell&quot; necessary?) and the choice to put only Parts 1-7 of &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; on there was rather peculiar, there is one great song after another, and it displays their genius from the pre-Dark Side period, in addition to showing how, from Dark Side thru The Wall, they were absolutely unbeatable.  The great lesser-known songs include &quot;Fletcher Memorial Home&quot;, &quot;Arnold Layne&quot;, &quot;The Happiest Days of Our Lives&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;See Emily Play&quot;.  This is, of course, in addition to all the great famous songs they made.  So if you want a great intro or condensed retrospective, definitely buy this album.
B000002AGN|5.0|What makes this CD unique is the combination of the virtuosity of the musicians and the creativity of the compositions. Blue Rondo A la Turk and Take Five are classics but the rest of the cuts here are outstanding as well. This is an historically significant recording that is an essential addition to any serious jazz collection.
B000001ES9|4.0|Led Zeppelin comparisons put away, we can say this is a very fine album by RUSH, their debut.<BR>What makes it unique and worth of owning is that is something of a pearl: RUSH never did something similar again.<br />THis is sheer hard rock of the nineties. IT has energy, courage and sincerity. Yes, we can clearly see their influences, but it´s not a Zeppelin rip-off, no way.
0316666343|4.0|Everyone has their own idea of heavn, and Alice Sebold certainly makes this the theme of her book.  14 year old Susie Salmon is murdered coming home from school one day, and chooses to watch the human world she left for many years as they struggled and fell apart, then fought to stay together.<br />A really interesting part of this book is you feel a connection through a lack of character development...which is pretty rare.  When your main character/narrarator is already dead, its interesting to see the other characters moving on, while Susie is only developed as memories and stories.  I think Alice Sebold did a wonderful job of incorporating so many characters and connecting them all in this world Susie chooses to observe.  A really clever technique was in fact using Susie as the narrarator because she is omniscent and knows everything, yet she is a real person and character that the novel is based around.<br />Some might question what the point of the novel is upon reading the end, when the story is wrapped up rapidly.  I think the purpose of the book isn't to discover who Susie was when she was murdered, but to discover who she and the other characters come to be after her murder, which makes the ending somewhat satisfying.  Although a few people might argue the last few chapters of the book are too far-fetched, the whole concept of the book concievably is paranormal in nature so if you consider the story to be too unrealistic, keep in mind that the idea of Heaven could really just be a fantasy. (Not to raise any religious questions or anything...)<br />I only give this book four stars because one of the things I was looking forward to in the book isn't revealed (If you read it, you'll probably feel the same way but I won't reveal it) and plus I think the ending scene before hte conclusion feels a bit incomplete, however it goes for a happy yet chilling ending which I could appreciate.
0385503954|2.0|What exactly, I ask myself, was this author trying to say? A young child accuses a young man of a crime. Her guilt possesses her life, excommunicates her sister from the family, and sends the man, who happens to be her sister's lover to prison. Had it been an adult who had done such a thing, the story would have depth, but from the beginning you realize the child has a vivid imagination, as said by the author when he describes her love of colorful words when she writes, which she loves to do. And so from the beginning you understand the police would never believe her story, and there, in my view, is where the story ends. Lives ruined, loves shattered, a young child haunted by one day when she was little? It doesn't work, and it isn't well written. The ending was beautifully put together, and that is why I gave it two stars and not just one. At times the author attempts to help the child recant her original accusation, which would have made sense, but then the author fails us, and doesn't, and tries to make a story out of a ludicrous, more-than-unlikely tale.
B00005JL96|5.0|This movie is awesome!  It is good for all ages.  Portrays the hawaiian culture very well.
B00007BHOE|4.0|I have just finished watching the entire Slipknot DVD &quot;Disasterpieces&quot; and am still in awe of how incredible it is.  The live performance has the best sound I have heard on a DVD, let alone any live performance yet.  Of course, Slipknot is performing, therefore making it a given that the visuals are phenomenal.  The performance captures every member's point of view in the incredibly intense event that is a Slipknot show.  Watching the band prepare for the show is visually enticing.  It makes the viewer realize how much work they put into every aspect of the show.  Aside from the live performance, extras such as VIP, which shows the viewer a face to face view of a certain member at a given time such as DJ Sid when he's doing his solo.  All Slipknot videos are included as well as the rare track &quot;Purity&quot;.  There are a couple of songs in which you can choose from which member's perspective you want to witness the spectacle.  Overall, this is the best music DVD I have ever seen! Slipknot is the best band in the world and it is proven in this DVD. Enjoy because something as good as Slipknot can't possibly last long! Stay (SIC) and buy the DVD! -x555AL666x
1573229725|5.0|Waters is an incredible writer. A well-crafted and extremely engaging story.
B000002UZU|5.0|I rank this as one of my top three albums of all time.  I include beside it Bob Dylan's &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; and Lou Reed's &quot;New York&quot;.  All three albums can be played at any time of the day, in any mood, in any company.  They all have a sound that continues from one track to the next.<br />You may have heard other Hooker albums, but this one is raw.  You hear him talking in the studio, his foot stompin, his ideas &quot;for when the band comes tomorrow&quot;.  &quot;I don't know how he's following me, but he does&quot; he says about the harmonica.<br />Highlights:  Messin' With The Hook, The Feelin' Is Gone, Send Me Your Pillow, Burning Hell, Peavine, and Boogie Chillen No. 2.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Despite its length (3 hours+), despite its complex web of characters and despite the pressure of trying to release another film on the heels of the artistic success of \\"Boogie Nights\\", Magnolia is quite simply a brilliant masterpiece of modern cinema.<br />Paul Thomas Anderson presents us with a powerful drama that becomes (among other things) a meditation upon the long-term consequences of the choices and decisions that we make in our lives and the effect that it has upon those we know and love. <br />Experiencing the raw emotional honesty of the characters (such as the grown-up child celebrity professing his unrequited love to a young male bartender, or the successful infomercial guru expressing his pent-up rage to his dying father) is a truly gut-wrenching experience. I've rarely seen such powerful and emotionally vulnerable performances. The cast is truly remarkable.<br />At yet a more abstract level, Magnolia is more than an interesting character study. It depicts the intricate nature of human relationships and the way in which relationships weave their way into the fabric of our individual existences.<br />Please experience this film....anyone who has lived long enough to have made significant choices that have changed the course of their life will find this film to be a powerful journey.
B00000K0EA|2.0|Tomorrow Never Dies introduces a new character in the James Bond-type tradition.  Michelle Yoah (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)does a great job as she fights, claws and kicks her way out of every scenario to fight the world against a media meglomaniac played by Jonathan Pryce.<br />Huh?  What's that?  You mean this is a JAMES Bond movie?  But I thought the purpose of a JAMES Bond movie was for JAMES Bond to save the world.  Funny - it seems here that Ms. Yoah can handle the situation quite well.  It looks like that JAMES Bond character gets in the way.  My bad.<br />I'm all for great, kick-butting female characters like Lora Croft &amp; Alias, etc.  So I think they make a sequel to this movie with the Michelle Yoah character, who completely takes over the movie.  But I thought this was a JAMES Bond movie.  Silly me.<br />As a new debut for a female JANE Bond, this movie gets 4 stars.<BR>As a JAMES Bond flick, it's useless.<br />Goldeneye was 100 times better.
B000003S2K|5.0|When Brian Eno presented the final master tapes of the record that would become Music For Airports: Ambient 1 to the record executives of his label, raised eyebrows and equally raised questions must have followed him during the course of the in-house session playbacks. On the surface, Music for Airports looked as though it wasn't going to go anywhere but the back of a fan's collection as a one off or an exercise in frivolity - Eno's musical science project or in some people's minds - Frankenstein's monster. Whichever the case, since its release in 1978, this record alone has stood the test of time as probably one of the most brilliant and innovative creations by a single artist since the minimalist beginnings of Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Cage and Terry Riley in the waning years of the jazz era. More importantly, Music for Airports gave birth to what Eno called &quot;the ambient music genre&quot; or music that combines stereophonic sound with a sense of spatial and audio displacement which then takes the listener out of his/her normal everyday environments and away to another place or another time. Since everyone will \\"hear\\" or perceive this kind of music differently, \\"ambient\\" provides an \\"otherworldly\\" form of expression for many artists and musicians today.  In preparation to make Music for Airports, Eno shared his ideas about ambient music with Soft Machine founder Robert Wyatt, who worked on various projects and albums with Eno through the 1970's. In the company of Wyatt, he began to construct (on tape) sound collages using prepared instruments, pre-recorded female voices and even simple sound environments using various microphones on tape machines in a studio setting.  It was this use of the recording studio, as an artist would use a canvas,  that gave Eno the means to see his  musical vision come to life. Music for Airports begins with the song \\"1:1\\", with Wyatt's prepared piano following a straightforward melody playing on itself over and over again with interludes of sounds and other instruments chiming in at various points throughout.  Track 2,  \\"2'1\\", starts out with a short mix of several rain shower-airlike female vocal tones which mix together at different intervals giving the listener a sense of \\"what happened\\" as opposed to \\"what is happening now\\". Track 3, \\"1'2\\" is a hybrid mix that combines the both the stealth-piano elements of \\"1'1\\" and air-watery elements of \\"2'1\\" giving the listener a definite sense of place and time. The last track \\"2'2\\", is entirely made up of synthesized tone patterns creating a diverse combination of negative and positive elements that flow into each other repetitively. Eno wrote these songs as a statement of how business, commercialism, culture and most importantly, travel, all are gathered in one specific place, specifically, an airport and how an airport can be a place where both bad news and good news can often meld into one. This music represents those feelings. It is a definite must have if you wish to go somewhere without stepping a foot outside your door.

B00003CXZ1|3.0|The premise of the movie is that the planets in our solar system are in a once in 5000 year alignment and Lara owns a \\"clock\\" that is the key to finding two pieces of an ancient device that allows time to be turned back. The action sequences aren't bad, but the story seems to have been taken from a early 90's game. Angelina as Lara was slightly wooden, but as eyecandy, she can't be beat. Except maybe by Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy in Batman and Robin. I purchased this one from the previously viewed bin at the local Blockbuster...

B00006LPK5|4.0|In reading these other reviews, I'm guessing that these other people are looking for something other than an action film! This grabbed my attention from the beginning. No...they DIDN'T show dragons the whole way through...that's the suspense part, fellows! The special effects were great, the dragons looked awesome, the acting was very believable. In the beginning I was wondering how they were going to &quot;get us&quot; to the dragon part...but sure enough, we were jet propelled into dragon land! The ending was the only weak part. That's why I only gave it a four-star rating. It was an emotional thriller that was beautifully made. Great movie.
0385508417|4.0|I'll be honest-I nearly didn't read this book. I'd received it as a gift from a close friend who knows my reading predilections well--and also knows I've avoided Grisham for a while now as I'd come to see his novels as overly repetitive and, therefore, boring. But every time I'd see her she'd inquire about the book, so, with a sense of dread, I sat down to read it.<br />It turns out that Grisham has finally diverged from his mass-manufactured overly frenetic pulp thriller habit and actually whiten a very different sort of story.<br />Grumpy Luther Krank and his sweeter wife, Nora, having just shipped their daughter off to Peru and a stint in the Peace Corps, decide to skip Christmas this year to forgo the gifts, the tree, the decorations, the cards, the parties and to spend the dollars saved on a 10-day Caribbean cruise. Luther wants a vacations from all the Christmas stress and, besides, the cruise will cost less in the long run than indulging in all the holiday hoopla common to the Krank household at that time of year.<br />Unfortunately for Luther, his decision places him in the vortex of a social storm. Friends, family and neighbors weigh in to communicate the lack of wisdom in such a decision-it seems that Luther's expenditures-or, more precisely, the lack of them--are an issues fort many of these folks.<br />The book is a comedic farce-casting comical aspersions on the social conformity, holiday hoopla and overt commercialism that have come to be so much a part-if not the reson for-Christmas in the U. S.---particularly in the 'burbs.<br />A last minute development cause Luther to reevaluate this plan and provides a window for all to reevaluate the meaning of Christmas as well.<br />This is a sweet story with cranky, quirky-yet recognizable characters. It is told with warmth and affections, not usually traits one associates with Grisham.<br />A lot of people criticize the book as being lightweight. True, it's not War and Peace, but it never aspires to be. What it is is an actual story told from the heart aimed at evoking genuine emotions with humor and affection.<br />A lot of folks act like that's some sort of cop out by Grisham. Those people need to get a life.it is is an actual story told from the heart aimed at evoking genuine emotions with humor and affection. <br />A lot of folks act like that's some sort of cop out by Grisham.

No matter what form of playing instrument I had to graduate to[i.e....4-track tapes, 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, cd's,] it didn't matter. I had to have this album to listen to in my car. Some how. It has to have the best road tunes ever recorded. If you have ever been driving down the highway, and &quot;going mobile&quot;,then you know what I mean.I think that pretty much sums it all up, don't you?<br />                                        casey sellen <BR>                                        avery county,n.c.
B00006RU5B|4.0|This supergroup doesn't disappoint, delivering a strong album of mature metallic grunge, although there is little new or groundbreaking here. It's nice to hear Chris Cornell rocking out again, especially after his attempt at a sensitive-guy solo career. His voice is as powerful and awe-inspiring as ever, especially in this album's strongest tracks - the rockers \\"Gasoline\\" and \\"Exploder,\\" and the truly dramatic power ballad \\"Shadow on the Sun.\\" In a few places Cornell is even experimenting with the higher registers of his voice that have been heard rarely before (this does not include the screaming of the early Soundgarden albums). The Rage guys are delivering more mature and well-constructed sounds than ever before, sounding considerably older and wiser. Guitarist Tom Morello has strengthened and clarified his heavy riffs, while in some of the slower songs he sounds downright elegant - especially \\"The Last Remaining Light.\\" Unfortunately, in a few cases Morello still displays his bad habit of cranking out weird noises at the expense of the songs. This makes the experimental \\"Hypnotize\\" almost impossible to take seriously, while Morello ruins the otherwise strong \\"Bring Em Back Alive\\" with an atrociously unmusical solo. The rhythm section is the biggest surprise here, holding down the fort in an accomplished way. Drummer Brad Wilk has finally discovered subtlety, which he was sorely lacking on the Rage albums; and bassist Tim Commerford is quite surprisingly solid and mature, sounding like a slightly heavier version of Pearl Jam's Jeff Ament. While this is a solid and enjoyable album, the only problem is the lack of new ideas that you would expect from a supergroup with this much power. In many songs you get the impression of Chris Cornell simply singing on top of leftover Rage tracks, or in some cases the slower numbers from the final Soundgarden album.

B000066NW0|5.0|I definitely love this album.  Even though she may be a high school drop out - she still has a talented gift.  She has such a variety of songs, from a lost love, to a angry woman, to a song about her loser hometown (we all know how that can be).  She also has the ability to reach some pretty amazing notes.  In \\"I'm With You\\" the end is pretty powerful with the way she sings.  I actually have 2 copies of this CD - one for the car because it's great for driving - and one for my desk - because it's great for studying.  It's definitely a great album for a 17-year-old

B00006LSM3|3.0|Last month,  I went to see Paul McCartney in concert in San Jose, and he did a touching tribute to George Harrison. It seems George was quite a fan of ukuleles, according to Sir Paul. In fact, George used to like to invite several people over to his house, where he would lead the group in big ukulele jam sessions. Paul would arrive to find George at the front door, handing out a ukulele to each guest as they arrived. What a great image! At this point Paul then pulled out his own ukulele, a gift from George, and proceeded to play \\"Something\\" on it. I loved Paul's story, and now I find George credited with playing ukulele on 4 of the 12 tracks on his new (and final ) album, \\"Brainwashed\\". One additional track also features George playing a \\"banjulele\\". Didn't know such a thing existed, maybe George invented it. Anyway, George is gone now, and much as I'd like to agree with other reviewers who cite \\"Brainwashed\\" as a career highlight, I cannot. I do like the album, I'm just not knocked out by it. The Jeff Lynne production places this album in the same group with \\"Cloud Nine\\" and the Traveling Wilburys, but here his production is more understated. I loved \\"Cloud Nine\\", but the lower key approach works better for this batch of songs. There is no can't-miss single that can stand up to \\"Got My Mind Set On You\\", or even \\"All Those Years Ago\\", \\"Blow Away\\", etc.. There are several fine songs, most notably \\"Any Road\\" and \\"P2 Vatican Blues (Last Saturday Night)\\", both of which could pass as singles. \\"Marwa Blues\\" is a pleasant instrumental, \\"Rocking Chair In Hawaii\\" is a nice Dylan-ish blues, \\"Never Get Over You\\" is a sweet love song, and George's slide work is distinctive and enjoyable throughout. But several songs are lackluster, and a few just go on too long. And the final song, the title track, is actually kind of annoying, at least for the first four minutes, before it then shifts gears and finishes with two minutes of lovely, hypnotic Hindu chanting performed by George with his son, Dhani, with a gentle tabla in the background. It's a beautiful close to a pleasant but inconsistent album.th his son, Dhani, with a gentle tabla in the background. It's a beautiful close to a pleasant but inconsistent album.

Beautiful directed and acted also funny.<BR><br />A man takes a new job on the 7th half floor of some building. His named is Craig and he finds an ad in the papers. He saw a filing clerk at Lester Company. One day he finds strange door in his office room. The door can be a John Malkovich's eye. When Craig is sucked into the door, he can be John Malkovich, an actor on Broadway, and boring Craig lives John's exciting life, meeting famous people and pretty girls every day. <BR><br />This film gave me fresh ideas. I thought this film, made of questions, absolutely this film fixed my idea when I watched John Malkovich's movies. <BR>The director, his name Jonze did a really amazing job. When I was watching the film I couldn't move away. And I couldn't understand what the director gives a message. I watched twice one day. Most people like romantic movies or science fiction. <BR><br />But \\"Being John Malkovich\\" is totally different film. That helped me to make a think by myself. How about my life and If I John, what am I doing? Have you been enjoy yourself in life? Are you enjoying now?<BR><br />I loved this movie. It is original!<br /><br />Ever eant to be someone else?

B00003CX9E|5.0|This Fictional Account of the life of Charles Foster Cain (Really William Randolph Hearst...but I digress) is atop every critics list for a very good reason...It was duely earned!<br />This film is nothing short of a masterpiece in terms of casting (Ruth Warrick brings a powerful edge in the most subtle performance you will ever see!), lighting, camerawork, writing...you name it and it's got an element of filmmaking that is the benchmark of greatness.  <br />What's even more astounding is realizing that Welles was 25 when he made this!  How someone could convey so many tacit aspects of a larger than life character and keep him real without making him a cartoonish buffoon is an amazing feat when you think of the life experience you need to live for the kind of perspective necessary to avoid a very easy pitfall such as that.<br />This DVD should be a staple to any self-respecting DVD collector...it can't possible disappoint you.
B000075BFK|5.0|2pac has long been deceased but his music continues to show growth as if the man is still around to perfect his lyrics.  if you are a fan of hip-hop or rap than this cd will be one of your favorites within a week.  long live 2pac, the G.O.A.T. (greatest of all time)!!!
B00006RU5B|4.0|Audioslave are finally here after all the talk of last years supposed break up.  Bless them for staying together through it all.  This is one stellar album.  I think the best thing to do is put the album in and listen to it in its completness.  It is one of those albums that flows entirley well together.  It is rocking, yet soothing at the same time.  Grunge is making it's comeback in a big way with also releases from Peral Jam and the Nirvana's &quot;New track.  JUmp on it all.  The time is now.<br />JUst keep this Cd in your rotation and it will grow on you, I am certain of that.  Cprnell has a great voice, and the remainder of RATM can still play, despite having to swith to a differant vocalist style.<br />Get it, got it, good.
0066214122|4.0|Being a fairly diehard fan of the work of Michael Crichton, I was pretty excited when I received my copy on release morning. I picked it up and ready it straight through. The science behind the book is mind-blowing. As usual, the longtime spinster has crafted a mix of science fact and science fiction into a pretty good story. That's my biggest complaint about this novel. The story was just pretty good. Now from any other author, I think this would be an excellent read. From Crichton however, whose mind can at times be sharper than a surgeon's scalpel, this one doesn't make the cut. The plot seems forced, almost like this is an abridged version of what it was intended to be. This really takes away from the natural element of suspense that the story is capable of. Here's hoping that there will be a &quot;director's cut&quot; of this novel release in the future, but then again, some things never turn out how you think they will.
0425170349|3.0|This novel is filled with action. But unfortunantly that is because it is so long. There were too many dull points in the book, and it had a terrible anti-climax. The final battle was so boring! But still, Clancy writes a good scene, none the less.
B00006SFBD|5.0|I really love bands like Opeth. By that, I mean bands that consistently crank out one awesome album after the other, with little or no slack in quality.  Bands such as these are hard to come by these days, but they're great to have in this day in age.<br />Anyway, this, Opeth's new release, most definitely does not disappoint.  If there's one thing that can be said about \\"Deliverance\\", it's that it is heavy!  Without a doubt their heaviest yet.  Heck, the opening track, \\"Wreath\\", could easily be mistaken for Suffocation, if not for the epic length and softer passages.  For those of you out there who aren't particularly down with straight-up death, fear not, for while this may take a little more effort on your part to get into, I think there is still enough melody and variety here for any Opeth fan to enjoy it.<br />As always, the musicianship is just great.  There are a few more solos than on the last album, and the drumming is among their most furious yet.  A friend of mine put it best when he said that it sounded like he got bionic legs, and was posessed by Buddy Rich. Ok, the Buddy Rich thing is a bit of a stretch, but the double bass work here is quite mad.  He still does the textured, complex drumming that he's known for, but the speed is generally kicked up a notch.  And of course, I gotta mention Mikael. I swear he gets better and better on each album. His growls are more menacing than ever, and his melodic vocals (though slightly more sparse) are just as good.<br />As far as favorite songs, it's hard to say, as Opeth's albums tend to have the feel of one long composition, but I think at the moment I'd have to go with \\"Master's Apprentices\\".  The coolest moment on the the entire CD is during this song, where it slows down to a tranquil melodic part, and then suddenly, out of nowhere, Mikael roars \\"Plunging deep into the void!\\".  Too freakin' cool.  The aforementioned \\"Wreath\\" is great for an adrenaline rush, \\"A Fair Judgement\\" is more calm and laid-back, and the 14-minute \\"By the Pain I See in Others\\" makes for a thrilling album closer.  All of the songs top 10 minutes (save for the short instrumental, \\"For Absent Friends\\"), and as usual, there is nary a dull moment to be found.<br />Yep, it would seem that as long as Opeth is around, there will be no shortage of great music in today's scene.  Can't wait to hear what \\"Damnation\\" is gonna sound like. It should be interesting.  Anyway, buy this if you love Opeth. You'll be glad you did.the 14-minute \\"By the Pain I See in Others\\" makes for a thrilling album closer.

B00005OM4N|3.0|I'm not gonna write an extended review cuz i dont think it's worth it, I'll just say it like it is.No talent,no substance, no depth,but darn catchy dance songs.fun.
B000000W9Z|5.0|this is bowie in his darkest, artistic, craziest... i miss this period from the mid 90s... do not miss this album, but be ready for an offbeat ride into bowies dark regions! still, great melodies and as original as you will ever get from a major artist! i love this album. a MASTERPIECE!
0399226907|5.0|Love it. My two year old just loves this book. She puts her fingers thro all the holes the caterpillar made and great for counting. A anytime of the day favourite
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This is some of the most moving music I have every had the pleasure of hearing. It blends perfectly in the movie and listening to it by itself is no less that thrilling. The theme captures the resignation with hope that Frodo and all the fellowship experiences. The Hhobbit theme captures the very essence of the hobbit's and establishes their culture in one's mind. All in all it is an excellent buy, and I would recomend it higher than highly.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones, with her famous parentage, has burst on the music scene, and while it may be Vanessa and Michelle who are getting the airplay, don't be fooled. The &quot;buzz&quot; is all about Norah Jones, whose smoky, velvet voice is the not only a singer's dream, but a listener's as well.  While &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; received a lot of air play, it deserved more. But because so many songs on the album are a little on the slow-tempoed side, it's probably the only one you'll hear on the radio. So treat your ears. She does a great job especially with the standard &quot;The Nearness of You.&quot;  You can buy this album knowing she's sure to be even brighter in the future. Then you'll know why the buzz is about her, while the only buzz some of the more heavily-promoted female artists will have in the future, is the murmur of inane conversation of distracted shoppers flipping through the bargain bin at a second-hand store.
0385503954|1.0|This book started out well but ended in a thud of nothingness.  The ending made no sense but the book fell out of favor about half-way through.  I suspect people say they love Atonement solely to make people think they read &quot;serious&quot; fiction.  A waste of valuable time.
6300214559|4.0|&quot;Lady Jane&quot; was a very beautiful movie but it was not accurate.  The person who play Jane Grey seem too cold and even rude sometime but in reality Jane was a sweet girl, not cold and rude.  Also Jane didn't love Guildford Dudley, they never had a love romance like in the movie at all.  This movie is mostly base on the beautiful love story between Jane and Guildford but that love story never existe is not accurate.I think the one who play Queen Mary was good and seem to have more character then the one in the more modern movie &quot;Elizabeth&quot; with Cate Blanchett.  Mary in the movie &quot;Lady Jane&quot; is not boring and plain like the one in the movie &quot;Elizabeth&quot;.It's still is a beautiful and good movie.  I love the atmosphere in this movie and the beautiful costumes.  The main actors, the one who play Jane and Guildford give a good performance even if it's not accurate!
6304873441|5.0|This is a fantasic cartoon, it is fascinating even for adults. I thought this was a disney film for a long time and was very surprised to find out that is wasn't, it is deffinitely as good as any Disney movie. It is a thrilling experience for kids and adults to watch!
B00006V9A0|5.0|All the reviews that are up here trash the former band's newest album, just because the war between Courtney Love and band members resulted in only one new release, \\"You Know You're Right\\".  I'll say right now -- I love Nirvana.  Many bands release albums with repeat songs on it, and Nirvana in no different.  I commend their effort to put together yet another album long after Kurt's suicide.  To me, there's nothing like hearing about a new Nirvana album coming out, rushing to the store, bringing it home, carefully taking it out of it's shrinkwrap and listening to it in the dark, thinking about what each song sounded like brand new, when Kurt was still alive.  I like the repeat songs, they are fantastic on any compilation album, and this album is no exception -- it is fantastic.  For any Nirvana fan, this is a must-have.  Just because it's out in time for Christmas doesn't make them money-grubbing jerks; former band members wanted to release it a long time ago, and Courtney Love's disagreement brought us to where we are today.  Luckily, it's out, it's awesome, and it brings back a lot of memories.  Also, for the person who doesn't own any Nirvana yet and loves the sound of \\"You Know You're Right\\" on the radio, buy this!  Why buy all the individual albums when you can get the cream of the crop right here?
0316666343|5.0|Very few books take up permanent residence in my mind but this one certainly does.  For anyone who has ever lost a loved one, this story will provide comfort and solace; you will dearly wish it is true (and maybe it is).  Beautifully written, it reads almost like a poem.  Some readers are put off by a part that may seem farfetched (I won't give away details) but for Susie it wiped away the ugliness and replaced with it with the beauty she deserves.  Don't miss reading this book.
B00005JCAA|4.0|might drown you in syrup.<br />Again I ask the question: Why do so few filmmakers know when to stop? The ending is so unnecessary here that it reminded me of Spielberg's grossly unnecessary endings--in A.I., in Minority Report, in Saving Private Ryan. There's a point in this film--just like Spielberg's--were the right balance of provocativeness and emotion could be struck, but the lure of schmaltz seems too much to resist; there's too much pressure to wrap movies in perfect bows.<br />But aside from the ending, this movie drew me in and kept me glued to the screen. Obviously, you bring a bit of your own mood to what you watch, which may explain why some viewers found the pace too slow. I found it well paced, and it allowed me to savor some phenomenal acting turns--not just Hopkins and Pitt--that rang true to life. Cap it off with an intelligent script and a nice soundtrack which crosses to overbearing only a few times ... Meet Joe Black is a pleasant reminder of just how nice it can be to watch a movie.<br />This is NOT a great movie, but it's a very, very good one.
B000002UDB|2.0|&quot;Imagine&quot; if All You Need Is Love, Hello Goodbye, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields had been subbed into Sgt. Pepper in place of the goofy Mr. Kite, the horrid Within You Without You, and the lackluster Fixing A Hole and When I'm 64. That would have been an album.<br />The reality is that the four good songs on Mystery Tour just can't overcome the likes of Blue Jay Way, Flying or Your Mother Should Know.<br />Nevetheless, I rate this 2 stars because of the strength of the 4 best songs.
B00006LFGD|5.0|2002 is the 40th anniversary of Barbra Streisand's recording career with Columbia Records.  She signed her first contract with them on Oct. 1, 1962!  Columbia, in celebration of this, released ESSENTIAL BARBRA STREISAND along with several remastered Streisand albums earlier this year.  As 2002 draws to a close, Columbia has released *another* collection of Streisand hits - this time DUETS - Streisand's collaborations with various singers over the years.  <br />The DUETS album has 2 new tracks: a duet with Barry Manilow (&quot;I Won't Be The One To Let Go&quot;) and another with freshman and producer David Foster protege Josh Groban (&quot;All I Know of Love&quot;).  The new tracks show that, at 60, Barbra is still in excellent voice and singing like a dream.  The Manilow song (cowritten by Richard Marx) is an old-fashioned pop tune which I like a lot.  &quot;All I Know Of Love&quot; (written by Foster) takes some getting used to.  It's a &quot;busy&quot; song, half classical, half pop.  Groban sings in Italian.  Barbra does not.  Yet, it is a fresh sound for Streisand and she rises to the occasion.<br />The rest of the tracks have appeared on previous Streisand albums.  A new fan may not have heard these songs.  They range from excellent (the duet with Judy Garland; Ray Charles; &quot;One Hand One Heart&quot; with Johnny Mathis) to simply ordinary.<br />There are some overlooked gems that I am glad were included here.  I happen to like the Don Johnson duet (&quot;Till I Loved You&quot;).  If you can get past the obvious Johnson jokes, it is actually a good song and their voices (rough and sweet) mix wonderfully.  &quot;Make No Mistake He's Mine&quot; is the best Streisand duet with another woman, IMHO.  Again, Kim Carnes' gritty voice is a great foil for Streisand's smooth one.  &quot;One Less Bell&quot; is a duet from the BARBRA JOAN STREISAND album - Barbra duets with herself!  This is an incredible track.  Some will make fun of the fact that Streisand duets withherself, but I suggest listening first - it's an instant classic and I am glad it's getting the exposure on this DUETS album.<br />I would be happy never seeing &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot;, &quot;You Don't Bring Me Flowers&quot; and &quot;Guilty&quot; on another Streisand album again.  They have already appeared on at least 3 other albums. They are excellent songs and definitely have a place in Streisand's catalog.  I just wish they'd stop getting recycled.  (It would be cool to hear a remix of &quot;Enough is Enough&quot; though...)<br />I gave this cd 5 stars because I love Streisand and am glad everyone will get to hear these classic duets assembled on one cd.
0553382179|4.0|Mrs. Cilley provides constant encouragement for people to take baby steps toward becoming neat, clean, organized, and clutter-free.  She never berates her readers.  She points out that the effects are cumulative, and that one's self-image has an effect on how one maintains one's home.  For those who have lost hope, this is a good place to start.<br />Her Flylady program depends on e-mail, which, if you aren't constantly by a computer, you would not receive.  The book is a helpful guide for those who either can't sit and get e-mail, or who need to use a computer for their jobs.<br />The book's one weak area is in estimating time.  And there is a passage (which I couldn't locate quickly) in which she says, &quot;Eventually housework should take hardly any time at all.&quot;  True, if one maintains one's residence daily, less would accumulate for the weekends.  But it is simply not realistic to say it would take &quot;hardly any time.&quot;  There is an irreducible minimum, and much of it must be repeated day in and day out.<br />This book seems more aimed at stay-at-home moms than working ones (such as the advice to get all the way dressed, to shoes; what working woman wouldn't do that?).  But there is something here for everybody if you look for it.
B000001ESN|5.0|Not much more to say really. Read some of the many other reviews for further insight into the individual songs on the album. This is simply a superb album from start to finish. Most of you know the songs so buying it is an easy decision. If you're new to Rush then it's still a no-brainer. Order this and Moving Pictures immediately as starter CD's and you can expand your collection based on those two purchases.
B000066NW0|5.0|I LOVE HER CD IT IS THE COOLEST! I MEAN IT! MY FAVORITES ARE SKA8OR BOI AND COMPICATED! I LISTEN TO THEM EVERY DAY.IT IS A MUST.CHECK OUT HER NEW CD TOO.
B000069AUI|4.0|I was blown away with Parachutes, and I didn't think I could be amazed again, but boy was I wrong. A Rush of Blood To The Head\\" is a record that in many cases surpasses the greatness of the debut. For one thing the band has matured a bit, but hasn't gone all stuffy. They are more aware of the subtle nature of the piano and emotionally grueling lyrics. The even more amazing thing is that they keep it from being a complete depressing wash of an album. One minute you'll think of loves past and how they were lost (The Scientist) then the next minute, your on to tales of joyous self content. (In My Place)  The record gets even stronger with each listen. MUCH more so than Parachutes, which benefited from an instant catchyness. This disc has that quality too, but since the songs lean toward the deeper end of the spectrum, the rewards are longer lasting. There is an obvious influence this time around, and no, I'm not talking about Jeff Buckley or Radiohead. A Rush... reaks of mid period Bunnymen records. Echo and the Bunnymen have been touted as a major influence on Chris Martin and songs like Warning Sign and Amsterdam confirm it. Coldplay have the talent and accessability to appeal to a lot of people, yet the rock coolness to be your favorite band. This disc is going in my top ten of the year.
B00006LFGD|3.0|Ok - the music is great but not much is not new.  The final track with Josh Groban is delightful....a wonderful combination of talent.  The last track saved it as far as I am concerned.  Would love to hear more new and less rehashing.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album like any system CD is Worth adding to your collection. The only downside to this cd is there are acouple of filler tracks that you usually don't see on system cd's. They are also lacking some badass compilation songs like Marmalade, Metro, Johhny, and Shame featuring the Wu Tang Clan. But songs like Innervissions, Boom, the system, Bubbles, and I-E-A-I-A-I-O make the Cd a deffinite trademark album. Personaly i think Ego Brain and Roullette should be destroyed along with Deer Dance into the vault of songs that just don't cut it but all in all a great cd.
0316666343|5.0|The utterly amazing new novel by Alice Sebold is both ground breaking and emotionally dense.  Sebold manages to draw her readers in with a sweet and innocent voice.  This novel is horrifyingly begun in the voice of a murder fourteen year old girl, Susie Salmon.  Heaven and death are explained in a beautiful and tender way through this young girl.  Sebold manages to explore Susie's heaven and the demented mind of her killer George Harvey with equal attention to detail.<BR> Sebold creates an interesting and fascinating novel through her characters.  Each person in the novel is more engaging more interesting then the next.  Susie describes her own death in heart wrenching detail.  She then observes as her sister Lindsay falls in love and loses her virginity all the while hardening herself against any emotion.  Through Susie's view from her heaven the reader is involved intimately with each character as he or she is presented on the page.  We are drawn through the past and follow the present as we might never do after death.<BR> This novel is emotionally charged and dramatic in its plot.  However the plot never draws your attention away from the evolvement you feel for Sebold's wonderfully lifelike characters.  This novel will make you want to grad a hold of your nearest family member and not let go.  What is life after death like?  Who knows?  Well maybe Alice Sebold does.  And maybe you will too if you take my advice and read The Lovely Bones.
0316666343|1.0|This book was absolute pointless nonsense. Ms. Sebold's storyline was sophmoric at best, and a thorough waste of my time.  My only reason for finishing her novella was that it took no brains to read and was sort of like a car wreck (horrible to look at, but in its horror, fascinating).<br />I'm sorry I bought it and cannot believe that it was as highly recommended as it was.  Bring back your book club, Oprah!

B00007G207|2.0|Most director's cuts of movies have novelty values. Some such as Blade Runner or the Extended Version of The Fellowship of the Ring not only enhance the experience but also made one wonder why the original versions were released at all. Sadly, the director's cut of Cinema Paradiso was a major disappointment. The addional footage in the first half, such as Toto losing his virginity were inconsequential, however the addition of a major sequence in the second half, when after the funeral, Toto met and rekindled his relationship with the now older Elena altered the trajectory of the movie and worst of all, diminished the emotionally charged ending. <br />The original version of Cinema Paradiso is one of my favourite films of all time. There is also little doubt that Tornatore is a wonderful film maker, however, in this case, the original editor(s) deserved praise.

B000066NW0|5.0|I l ove this CD!!! Although there is a few cuss words in the songs (not many though) they are so good! My fave is #1 Losing Grip. I love the guitar in the beginning. Sooo catchy!!! Anyways I like Complicated(even though I am a teeny bit tired of it), Sk8er Boi, I'm With You (it has the D word in the chorus), Mobile is an OK song, Unwanted, Tomorrow ( the guitar in that song is awesome!), Anything But Ordinary... there all so good!!! #'s 4, 10, and 11 have cuss words in them but only like once or twice.

B00005RY7X|5.0|To get the feel of the type of music Andrew writes, and what kind of a guy he is, here is an excerpt from a post he wrote on his website. <br />I will see you all again soon. When I say friends, I mean friends. Not fans, or followers... FRIENDS. And I mean that and take it very seriously. As I've said before, I did not write this music for me, I wrote it for us. And when I can see US enjoying it and living it, it is the best feeling in the world. I also say: consider yourself a member of this band. When you see me somewhere, on T.V. or in a magazine, please say, &quot;Hey! That's my friend Andrew!&quot; When something good happens for me, it happens for you. And when you are doing good, know that it is also good for me. We are only as far along as the farthest behind, and I want us to all be way ahead. What is important to you is important to me. There is no reason that I am here and not there - really it's just crazy. But I consider myself a representative of all of those who can't be here all the time. I am doing this for you. I am doing this for us. I am doing this for people who believe in having fun, and who do not feel guilty about being happy.<br />This entire CD is amazing.  I'd like to thank my friend Andrew for making such an excellent CD.
B00006F7S4|5.0|i am an avid beck fan.  but the first time i listened to &quot;sea change&quot;, the impression i got was &quot;boooooring!&quot;, and indeed, i was riding the bus and i drifted off to sleep.  luckily, i was breaking up with someone at around the same time and the episode made me revist this so-called &quot;break-up&quot; disc.<BR>after 3 or 4 listens (as other reviewers have attested), i have no doubt in my mind that this is one of the first pop masterpieces of the new century; top 40 fades from consciousness over time, but good music grows on you; and sea change is supremely good.  the sonic landscapes reveal more with each lesson, and beck's talent as a singer-songwriter has never been more apparent.  i've found that i've always lacked &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;calm&quot; music in my collection, but sea change has filled that niche and then some.<BR>yes, the tone is melancholy, but dig a little deeper.  some of the lyrics and textures are surprisingly buoyant, such as the lyrics of the bridge on the track &quot;guess i'm doing fine&quot;.  there is a sense of hope throughout the album, and it's this complexity of mood that puts &quot;sea change&quot; above and beyond other &quot;break-up&quot; albums.<BR>make some hot chocolate, turn down the lights, and find a comfy couch to let &quot;sea change&quot; grow on you; you won't be disappointed.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Just about every review of this so far has been lauding Svefn-g-Englar.  That's all fine and good but I think the track Vidrar vel til Luftarasa (Good weather for airstrikes) goes above and beyond what SgE does.  The depth and emotional quality of Vidrar are unlike anything I've heard before.  Seeing the music video for it only solidified it for me.  If this is the direction the music world is heading in, then I'll be a happy man.
B00000JCOV|5.0|The question i'd like to ask anyone reading this is \\"why wouldn't you buy this CD?\\"  Of all the groups i've listined to Slipknot is by far the best.  There are 9 guys who all are amazinly talented.  To that offical reviewer you must not listin to them very well.  Joey, the drummer is the best drummer i have ever heard.  There are two custom procussionists that play anything from propane tanks to timpinies.  The guitarist Mick and James play heavy complicated riffs that as far as i have heard and not been very well duplicated.  Corey Taylor is an amazing vocalist and has an incredible range.  It may sound like screaming at first, and much of it is, but i'd like to see you at a show sand up and sing as loud and well as him for 45 min strait without ripping your vocal cords.  As for the sample and the DJ it adds to the complexity of hte entire sound and makes it so much better.  This CD is a must buy for any Metal head and if you want to hear something different from mainstream music i would deffinitally check out Slipknot.  i love this album and you should too.
0141301066|5.0|I remember being 10 or something like that and reading this book to the point of wearing down the binding. It's extremely inspirational for a young girl. Some, like Matilda, might feel alone in this big world, but if you have enough determination, there's nothing you're not capable of! Also, Ronald Dahl's writing style is great for kids ages 7 and up! It's easy to understand and engaging at the same time. I'm gonna go and watch the 'Matilda' movie for the 50th time. Good thing the movie captures the book pretty well or eles I would sue for ruining such a wonderful story! hehe

0790734850|5.0|LA Confidential was the best picture of 1997. It is also one of the finest films of the decade and a quintessential descendent of the American film noir period. Walking in the footsteps of \\"The Big Sleep\\" and \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\", this fast-paced movie offers a great story, atmosphere and superb ensemble cast. Set against the backdrop of Los Angeles during the 1950's, the cinematography magnificently evokes the images of that period better than any other film in recent memory. The story begins with crime boss Mickey Cohen being sent up the river, which creates a power struggle to takeover his rackets. Three detectives, Lieutenant Edmond Exley (played by Guy Pearce), Officer Bud White (played by Russell Crowe), and Sergeant Jack Vincennes (portrayed by Kevin Spacey), are all drawn into a complex web of murder and corruption. By way of a beautifully written script, the trio eventually intersects on the same \\"Night Owl Murder\\" case and begin working together in spite of their differences; and, in the case of Exley and White, their intense hatred for one another. Each scene links together well and what unfolds is a vastly rewarding story of honor, redemption, sacrifice and friendship. The cast is outstanding, with star making performances by Pearce and Crowe and an Oscar winning performance by Kim Basinger as Lynn Bracken, the hooker with the heart of gold. Kevin Spacey lends his enormous talents as Jack Vicennes, the crooked cop that longs to go straight. James Cromwell also deserves special mention for bringing terrific nuance to his role as the sociopath, Captain Dudlely Smith. Curtis Hanson adeptly directed this groundbreaking film that at the time sported no big name stars. It demonstrates how refreshing Hollywood can be when new faces create memorable films.
B000000W9Z|5.0|The first time I heard this CD, except for the title tract, I promptly put the thing away and didn't give it a full and fair hearing. (The segues--computer treated voice interludes between songs--were an immediate turn-off and were actually distracting, at least initially). Afterwards, I put the CD on from time-to-time, skipping the segues, and found I really liked some of the songs. Upon repeated listenings, I've decided that most, if not all, of the songs are exceptional. It took a while, but now I really love this CD. It has tremendous depth; I play it all the time. I even appreciate the segues now: they are paintings in sound, and Bowie always layers on the paint thick. Outside is a challenging and innovative work...and besides, the songs kick [behind].
0316666343|2.0|While reading this book, I couldn't help but surmise that Sebold had her eye on Oprah Winfrey, in hopes that Winfrey would pick this book for her (now defunct) book club, and make Sebold's debut a best-seller. After all, the book is a paint-by-number exercise in writing an \\"Oprah Best-Seller\\" with all the main ingredients: a brutal rape and murder of a child, the 'distant' mother paired with  the 'too-loving' father, the un-gluing of a suburban family in the face of tragedy, alcoholism, despair, and of course, dysfunction. At times, I thought I already read this book; indeed I did, only it was Oprah's pick  \\"Fall on Your Knees\\", \\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\", etc. Without a doubt, Sebold had her eye on the Oprah trophy while writing this. However, Sebold's book was published in July, 2002...months after Oprah closed her Book Club for good. No matter; her audience was thirsty for another depressing novel - with or without Oprah's help - and this book seems to have fit the bill. Can the movie (starring Michelle Pfeiffer as 'the Mother') be too far off?
B00006RU5B|4.0|Being a fan of both Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, I was so amped for this album to come out.  I had followed news of the union of Chris Cornell and the remaining members of Rage, and had the &quot;Civilian&quot; disc.  When I got the Audioslave cd, I couldn't believe how different it was from the Civilian cd, now I understood why they were so upset when it leaked on the net!!<br />Tom Morello knocks me down again, I swear that Cochise has one of the best beginnings to a song, right up there with Korn's Blind.  And although it took me a little while to adjust to Chris Cornell singing instead of Zach De La Rocha, soon I was appreciating Audioslave for exactly that, being Audioslave.  Not Rage and not Soundgarden, but their own new hybrid type of music.  And it's good too, and that's hard to come by lately.  This cd just makes me feel good about a lot of things, and things to come as well!
B00003CXI1|2.0|I'm usually pretty open-minded, though I tend to stay away from big-budget films and especially over-hyped ones.  Nonetheless, when I finally saw this movie on cable the other day, I tried to be unbiased.  As I watched I was struck not by how bad this movie is, because it was not awful, but by just how mediocre it is.  It looks splendid, the goblins' makeup in particular.  Some of the computerized shots suffer from Lucas Syndrome, but it takes CGI technology just about as far as it can go nowadays.  Yet film is more than just a visual art, it's also about telling an interesting story involving real and compelling characters.  This film lacks both of those key ingredients.  The actors work well with what they have (I will not slander any cast that includes John Hurt and Alan Rickman), but an actor is only as good as is material (perhaps that's stretching it a bit, but I think you get my meaning).  The filmmakers drag out every rusty old cliche you can imagine, dust it off, slap the name \\"Harry Potter\\" on it, and present it here as a brand new product to be consumed and almost immediately forgotten.  Character development is nil, for example, it's rather hard to understand what motivates the evil Professor Quirrel to turn against his colleagues in the end.  Has he been masquerading all along as a good wizard when he in reality turnd to the \\"dark side\\" long ago?  Or has he switched allegiances because he's generally looked down upon for being a sniveling twit and seeks revenge?  Or is it something else entirely?  Perhaps I missed it, but I cannot recall this ever being properly explained.  Or what about when the children are punished for breaking a rule by being instructed to break ANOTHER rule by going out into a forbidden forested area, two of them unchaperoned even, and risking their lives?  Is that supposed to make sense?  The entire film is weakened by non-sensical plot twists and unbelievable characters, but even this is not the weakest point of the film.  The fact is, it's a bore.  Another long, predictable piece of eye-candy that is, rightly enough, meant for children.  Even so, there is no reason children's entertainment has to be this... mediocre.  The films I loved as a child didn't suffer these same problems.  Nowadays though, you get film after film after film of material of this caliber.  And it's evident in modern literature and pop music as well.  But now I'm just ranting.  Final thought: for family-oriented entertainment of a far superior quality, check out the first two Star Wars films (that is, Episodes IV and V), Raiders of the Lost Ark, How the Grinch Stole Christmas (the animated version), The Nightmare Before Christmas, Something Wicked This Way Comes, PeeWee's Big Adventure, Harvey, A Christmas Story, or The Bishop's Wife (1948) to name a few.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Finally, in this day in age when music was bad (especially among rock music), a band comes along to blow our eardrums out again.  While Audioslave is a Supergroup of some of our favorites, it is also the first band to come out with an original sound in quite a few years.  While bands like Tool are off experimenting and losing track of who they are, and Nickleback and Creed are just no good, some granddads of grunge come around and remind us (well at least me) of what rock music should sound like.<br />An excellent first effort for a bunch of guys with distinct musical and lyrical styles.  Hopefully we'll hear more in the future from them.  Hopefully they'll kick the industry in the pants and help improve the state of rock too!
0446608955|4.0|&quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; is a wonderful story of how love has the power to change.  It all begins when Landon Carter, the son of a wealthy congressman, runs for the position of class president.  Of course due to his popularity he wins.  The homecoming dance is the next weekend and all the representatives are supposed to go but Landon is unable to get a date at the last minute.  The only option left is church-going Jamie Sullivan the daughter of the towns reverend.  She has an unbelievable amount of faith and is always reading her bible she carries around.  Reluctantly he asked her and she happily accepted but said &quot;only if you promise not to fall in love with me&quot;.  At the time Landon didn't think that would be a problem.  While at the dance Landons ex-girlfriend Angela came drunk and Jamie found her in the bathroom throwing up all over. Jamie told Landon and they both helped clean it up and then took her home.  Landon was thankful to Jamie and realized that most dates wouldn't have helped so he told her he owed her one.  In return a couple  of months later Jamie asked Landon to take the lead role in the Christmas play.  Although he didn't want to he couldn't say no to her overwhelming kindness and because he remembered his promise.  This play was very important to her because her father wrote it.  He always wrote the Christmas play but this one was different. It was about how his wife,Jamies mother, died during child birth and how he was left to raise her all by himself.  In the play her mother turns into an angel which will be played by Jamie herself.  So she wants to make it extra special.  The night of the play when Jamie came out Landon was stunned by her beauty.  This was the moment there love began to flourish.  It was like nothing could go wrong. Then she told him &quot;I told you not to fall in love with me&quot; and revealed to Landon that she had a serious illness and didn't have more than a year left to live.  This was heartbreaking but only made their love stronger and their time left together more valuable.  If you would like to know how this story ends read the romantic love story &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot;.
B00006IR5S|5.0|After being disappointed by many of John Williams' recent movie scores (most notably the two new &quot;Star Wars&quot; tracks), I was delighted to find that he hasn't lost his touch.  &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; more than lived up to my expectations!<br />As with most Williams scores, &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is lengthy.  It clocks in at around 70 minutes, which I think is the ideal soundtrack length.  You feel like you've gotten your money's worth and can really get a feel for the movie.<br />Like &quot;Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; &quot;Chamber of Secrets,&quot; on the whole, is a relatively &quot;quiet&quot; soundtrack, not something that is suited to car-listening.  However, there are more exciting moments and themes on this soundtrack that make it much more enjoyable and interesting to listen to.  This time around, Williams had more action scenes to write music for, and this is very obvious as one listens to the CD.  The mood is much less subdued than that of &quot;Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; and the moments of excitement somehow ring truer.<br />I only have one complaint about this soundtrack, and it has absolutely nothing to do with the music:  The tracks aren't in chronological order.  However, this is one very minor irritation on an otherwise remarkable soundtrack.<br />Standout Tracks:<BR>&quot;Fawkes the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Fawkes is Reborn&quot;~ beautiful, excellent new theme; by far the best additions to the Harry Potter music library<BR>&quot;The Dueling Club&quot;~ fantastic mood music; I can see Harry and Malfoy facing each other on the table each time I hear it<BR>&quot;Reunion of Friends&quot;~ another take on the &quot;Fawkes&quot; theme<BR>&quot;Dueling the Basilisk&quot;~ the scariest most exciting track with a little of the &quot;Fawkes&quot; theme thrown in for good measure<br />Bottom Line:  A must-have for Harry Potter fans and John Williams fans alike!  A highly enjoyable, especially on repeated listenings.
B000075BFK|4.0|This is one of the better releases from 2pac since his death, with a variety of songs spanning the double album. The production is much better on this one then on Until the End of Time. 2pacs' lyrics are once again tight, making this album an overall excellent purchase. If you are a fan of 2pac, or are just sick of the hip hop that has come out recently, this album would be worth getting. Disc two reminds me of Me Against the World, in 2pacs subject matter, and his tone. Disc one has more hard core beats and lyrics. This album could possibly be a 4.5-5 star rated album, but realizing that the album would not have been how 2pac wanted it, its hard to to. Suprisingly, Nas raps on the album, and I believe Ja Rule produced a track. 2pac would not have wanted that. From a strictly musical sense this is an excellent album, but from a 2pac/westcoast perspective its weird to hear Nas and Pac on the same track. The other interesting thing about this album, is it seems Suge Knight is up to his old tricks again of spreading Pac alive rumors. In This Life I Lead, it sounds like 2pac says this is number 6, referring to years, in the middle of the song. But besides that, the two most obvious things are the intro, and the outro. The intro begins with questions about where these new 2pac songs keep coming from, spurring ideas that he is possibly alive. The outro, which is \\"hidden\\", coming on after #13 on disc 2, has 2pac stating to expect him to come back like Jesus, and finishes by saying I'm coming. This adds to the mystery of Pac certainly and does add to speculation that he could be alive. But without concreate evidence, most likely Suge Knight has an excellent editing device to have flipped the words around to fit what Suge wanted Pac to say. <BR>Overall though, if you disregard the 2pac alive theory, and the suprise guests, this is a pretty strong album, and worth getting in this time of overplayed and garbage era of hip hop.
B00006L85B|3.0|You often wonder if the record executives are milking everything they can.<br />Here is a fine collection, nonetheless of previously released Boleros from the great one himself.  The songs are CLASSIC.<BR>The DVD though is very disappointing...horrible audio with no presence (wish it coulda been better, had I known I would have saved my money).
B00006M183|5.0|Sigh.<br /><br />Every post grunge-era Pearl Jam album resurfaces these kind of talks. Why isn't X better than Y? Why couldn't they have done X like Y? Why isn't Ed/Mike/Stone/Jeff/Current Drummer better than they were on Y?<br /><br />Honestly, I'm surprised people want to talk in circles about something like this.<br /><br />I can remember when Vitalogy came out, listening the hell out of it, while many of my friends/contemporaries/whatever said that it stuck. \\"What's with all the punk stuff? Why did they put crap on there like \\"Bugs\\" and \\"Foxymop\\"? It ruined the album.\\" At the time I can remember thinking that these once flannel-clad individuals, who just a few years prior had gobbled up any shred of music made available by the band, were now turning a deaf ear because there is a two minute musical/vocal track where Eddie repeats P-R-I-V-A-C-Y, and a couple great little experimental tracks (one of which, was placed conveniently at the end of the album for easy skip-over). This astounded me, because nearly all my friends hated Vitalogy, and I thought it was their strongest work to date. If you went in and cut out all of the experimental stuff, you still have one of the best 45 minutes or so of rock produced in the '90s. But no matter. This was the beginning.<br /><br />No Code followed up a few years later. Barely a blip on the pop culture radar. \\"Who You Are\\" came and went as a first single, and nobody was left around for the following two radio releases \\"Hail Hail\\" and \\"Off He Goes,\\" which rank (to me) as two of their best. No matter, thought I, their my band now. \\"Not For You\\" indeed.<br /><br />Yield came and went, no biggie. No videos, no promotion. Maybe the best rock album to come out in the late '90s, totally ignored, except for some hardcore PJ fans & some great reviews.<br /><br />Then came the tour, which I had the opportunity to see a couple of shows. People said things to me like \\"They're still together?\\" and \\"I sure wish Eddie would write something more like Yellow Ledbetter.\\" Meanwhile, I was more than satisfied w/ performances of \\"Evolution\\" and \\"Given To Fly\\".<br /><br />Between \\"Yield\\" and the next album was the \\"good intention paving the path to hell\\" single that was \\"Last Kiss\\". Sure the proceeds went to the Kosovo refuges, and it was kept from the #1 spot on Billboard only by \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\", but the die was cast, and the band was reluctantly thrown back into the spotlight. Still, no video, no promotion.<br /><br />Binaural came out in 2000. Good songs. Overproduced? Under-produced? Maybe. Still, \\"Grievance\\" and \\"Insignificance\\" alone made the album better than good. \\"Eddie's voice doesn't sound as strong,\\" and \\"Why doesn't he belt something out like he did on Vs,\\" and \\"Where's my Limp Bizkit album\\" were heard at the record stores. The 2000 tour that followed was one of the best to date, maybe the best. Unfortunately the tragedy in Europe occurred, and briefly brought the band back into the spotlight. \\"Pearl Jam was playing a festival in Europe? Must be the only place they can sell tickets anymore,\\" I heard.<br /><br />Now comes \\"Riot Act\\". Once again, same old story, same old song and dance. 15 songs, some funky, some experimental, some traditional, and still the same comments. \\"Well, 10 years ago, they'd have never done an album like this,\\" and \\"Why can't Ed sing like he did on X, Y, or Z?\\" Well, there's your answer. 1991, by my last check, was nearly 12 years ago. In 1991 you had some great bands, like Nirvana and Faith No More, and Soundgarden, and PJ. You also had a ton of crap and pop on the radio (hair metal, NKOTB, etc). The more things change the more they stay the same. 2002 we get a new Nirvana single (not their best-effort, but I'll sure as hell take it), a new album w/ vocals by Chris Cornell (backed by RAGE...what a concept!), as well as a brilliant single by Pearl Jam, and a new album that (what a frickin' surprise) doesn't bow down or bend over for anyone. What brilliance! Pearl Jamdoing something their own way? Whodathunkit? And still we hear...\\"Eddie, why can't you sing like you did on X? I miss those days.\\"<br /><br />Well, I wish the Beatles would put out another \\"White Album\\", but it's not going to happen.<br /><br />Pearl Jam is here. They're still putting out damn good music. They didn't kill themselves, they didn't succumb to drugs, they didn't marry super models and fancy cars and run them both off cliffs. They haven't done commercials for soda, or for car companies, and they've yet to release a over-hyped, over-marketed greatest hits collection in order to pacify all those who should have been buying their albums all along.<br /><br />To Quote a track from Riot Act: \\"I've seen it all before... bring it on, cause i'm no victim ....\\"\\"Eddie, why can't you sing like you did on X?

She marries a man named Maxim, who's wife drowned a year before.  He can be very ill-tempered but she loves him. She moves to Manderly, an exquisite house just outside of London. She loves it, but she feel that she is in the shadow of Rebecca, Maxim's first wife. None of the servants like her either.

B00005JKCH|1.0|Not worth the time it takes to view it.  Boring, long, dull, and the acting was poor as well.  Don't bother.
B00007E8V4|5.0|From the first track, Chic 'N' Stew, to the last track, Streamline, this album is unbelievable.  I personally was one who had &quot;sampled&quot; this album (the majority of tracks at least) when it was leaked to the internet many months back.  They re-recorded the songs and they sound much better.  Anybody who even thinks they might be a fan of SOAD, this CD will confirm it.  Good stuff.
B000070WJE|5.0|Robbie Williams is one of the most important singers in Europe nowadays, though he is not known in US. Since his early days as a member of the former boyband \\"Take That\\", Robbie has developed a very successful solo career, with great albums, such as \\"Sing when you´re winning\\" and \\"Swing when you´re winning\\", the latter a tribute to the big old bands.  <br />\\"Escapology\\" is Robbie Williams latest album, the fifth of his solo career and the first of a multimilionare contract he has signed with EMI, receiving over 120 million dollars for five CDs. <br />The first single is called \\"feel\\", which is getting lots of airplays everywhere. It´s a cool jazzy and pop song, with a great video, in which Robbie plays the employee of a rich farmer, played by Daryl Hannah. It´s worth checking.<br />\\"Something beautiful\\" is a great track, similar to some old songs of stevie wonder. The lyrics are interesting and talk about a girl looking for a new love to fullfill and give sense to her life.<br />\\"Sexed up\\" is a strong ballad, about a love which is over and should \\"blow away\\", as a revenge.<br />\\"Monsoon\\" shows the new face of Mr. Robbie Williams, a pop star tired of his life on the spotlight, with beautiful women, drinks, money and meaningless sex.<br />\\"Love somebody\\" is the typical Queen song, with lousy guitars and a real choir singing part of the lyrics.<br />\\"Revolution\\" is an upbeat duo Robbie sings with a new singer called Rose. The lyrics are good and they really work fine together.<br />\\"Handsome man\\" is one of the most interesting pop songs Robbie has ever made. Great chorus and lyrics.<br />\\"Me and my monkey\\" is a funny song, about an adventure of Robbie  and his monkey in Mexico, with guns and whores. It´s long, not commercial song, but really catches you, because it has a mexican arrangement. <br />\\"Nan´s song\\" is a nice and tender track on this album, about Robbie´s dead grandmother. It´s like a small poem, very touching.<br />With \\"Escapology\\", EMI intends topromote Robbie in US, making him known to the huge public. If you never heard about Robbie Williams before, buy this record, and I´m sure you´ll appreciate the great work of UK´s most famous bad boy.
B00005NTJM|4.0|This was the Tull I remember from the first American tours, which they shared with &quot;Jimmy Page's new band&quot;. (Good concerts and underattended!) The further they got from this sound, the less I liked it, but by the time Aqualung came out, the old Tull was a memory, kind of like how Led Zep 4 made a memory of their first.  One has to smile at the blazing music of Abrams and Anderson. Fond memories encapsulated here. (Also recommended &quot;Benefit&quot; and &quot;Stand Up&quot;).
B00006LFGD|5.0|Although most of these tracks were previously released, it's great to have a complete retrospective of Streisand's duets.  Some were smash hits (Guilty, No More Tears, You Don't Bring Me Flowers) and others are somewhat forgotten gems (If You Ever Leave Me, Make No Mistaken).  What's most impressive is the diversity of the collaborators (Frank and Judy to Kim Carnes and Don Johnson!) and the consistent quality of Streisand's vocals.  <br />Most importantly, the new duet with Josh Groban is truly fantasatic.  Their voices meld seemlessly.<br />Great CD.

The production on some songs could have been better and i wish tupac was still around to oversee his music. I miss the dayz of makaveli where every song was amazing.

B000007O9L|5.0|Stripped is a great Stones live album mainly because they do many of their early work from when they started out. Recorded on<br />the Voodoo Lounge tour, the cd carries many highlights. If you're<br />a fan who just wants to hear the band play hits like Satisfaction<br />and Brown Sugar, this is not the album for you. But if you would<br />like to hear the band's early songs from their pre-Satisfaction days, then this is definitely your album.<br />Stripped features the band doing their acoustic-based songs. While Street Fighting Man, Wild Horses and Angie are known to all<br />Stones fans, the album features lost gems from long ago. Let It<br />Bleed was a memorable album, and the title track is featured here<br />in a version that beats the original at its own game. The country<br />tune Dead Flowers from Sticky Fingers is here, and blasts the<br />original into rock 'n' roll oblivion. Not Fade Away was their first American hit single in 1964, so it's a nice inclusion. The<br />original version was more like a Bo Didley tune, while the version here has more a steamy, provocative feel to it, and it has nice harmonica fills by Mick. Dead Flowers from 1971's Sticky<br />Fingers is here, and, like Let It Bleed, blasts the original into<br />rock 'n' roll oblivion. The Exile On Main Street track Shine A<br />Light has a nice, gospelly feel to it, with good piano playing by<br />Chuck Leavell. The Spider And The Fly is a devillish track that<br />was the Stones' first stab at recording their own blues tunes<br />rather than covering songs by their heroes. Their cover of Bob<br />Dylan's Like A Rolling Stone has become a highlight of their live<br />shows, and it has a beautiful harp solo. Their some other really<br />great live tracks that I haven't mentioned yet, but that will<br />spoil the rest of the album for you loyal Stones fans. But I will<br />tell you that there are some great tracks culled from rehearsals.<br />It is great to hear the spooky Robert Johnson blues Love In Vain,<br />and the band is brilliant.

B00005N5S5|4.0|Shot on a tight schedule with an even tighter budget The Terminator shows what James Cameron can do with a story. No need to go into detail on the plot but this movie saved Arnold Schwarzenegger's career and he was excellent in the title role. The movie is quickpaced with the killer android sent to alter<BR>the past by killing the mother to be of the man reponsible for the machines defeat. Future records are fragmentary so the Terminator locates Sarah Connor by using a phone book- and methodically going down the list murdering all of them. He's very brutal,letting nothing get in his way, not even an entire police station full of cops (remember that I'll be back line?)I think that I like all of the portrayals done by the actors, it's a shame that Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn seem to hhave about hit their peaks with their roles here.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Alright..this movie is great. It lacks some essential star wars things like a classic star battle and such but it has one unbeatable thing. The lightsaber fight with Darth Maul, obi wan and qui gon. If you haven't seen it you must. The rest of the movie is good as well but the lightsaber fight is just...WOW!
B00003CX5P|4.0|This film's greatest features are the sets and special effects, they're fantastic, but I think it generally makes a fun story to spend an afternoon or evening with. I'm still not too clear about some of the details but I find the idea of evil Empire interests taking over the Planet Naboo to be very interesting and not too badly done. Yes, Jake Lloyd as young Anakin is kind of a cartoon character, but then much of the time he does do all right for a boy. Some of his scenes, such as the Pod races and the space battle get very silly (an attempt to draw in the younger audience?)but most of the time I found his delivery to be good. Liam Neeson wasn't bad as Qui-Gon and I think Natalie Portman did a great job as Queen Amidala. The worst characters in my opinion were the invasion force leaders, they sounded just like the bad imitation Japanese/Chinese bad guys from some old 50's movies (and probably were meant to give that impression), and the Gungans (especially Jar-Jar Binks, although even he had his good moments). I suppose those were sort of intended to provide laughs, which didn't work very well for me. The story's not bad, most of the characters are good, the sets and effects are wonderful, I think this movie outperforms the three original movies in most ways. Have fun watching it.
B000066F6H|4.0|The Hives' sophomore album, Veni Vidi Vicious, has been available through its native Swedish label Burning Heart since 2000, and it was released domestically shortly thereafter via the punk indie Epitaph. A handful of its tracks also show up on the popular U.K. import Hives anthology Your New Favourite Band. Nevertheless, in a fit of post-Strokes/ White Stripes acquisitiveness, the newly reactivated Sire Records (brought back just for The Hives) has picked up Veni Vidi Vicious, figuring that the weight of a corporation might persuade music buyers to purchase a CD that they've virtually ignored for two years.<br />The Hives' brand of neo-garage leans heavy on punk and lacks nuance, but the unification of speed, volume, and shake generates a scalding steam. The band has a shtick, too: Dressed in black-and-white suits, sporting names like \\"Destruction\\", \\"Vigilante\\", \\"Arson\\", and \\"Dangerous\\", and sticking to the story that it was assembled, 'N Sync-style, by a Swedish music mogul named Randy Fitzsimmons, the quintet understands how a strong concept can cover substantive lapses. In The Hives' case, those lapses include the lack of a killer, instant-classic rock anthem to put the balance of its sloppy, bull-headed minimalism in context. Only a few tracks on Veni Vidi Vicious strive for timelessness. \\"Main Offender\\" reduces the velocity by a half-crank, as singer Howlin' Pelle Almqvist describes his flair for obnoxiousness. When the whole band shouts the chorus, \\"This is my main offender\\" (referring to the music itself), the slight hesitation before and after the sing-along lends the track a base power. Later, \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\" deploys a few squiggly synths and an extended instrumental intro to add density to the group's fist-pump-worthy three-chord riffing.<br />On the whole, The Hives is locked into its speed-to-the-finish bash, with each instrument in each song holding to a single melodic pattern for the two-minute-average playing time. Though a guitar or twomay drop out momentarily for the sake of dynamism, the compositions feature few surprises. Still, rockets from the gut like \\"The Hives - Declare Guerre Nucleaire\\" and \\"A Get Together To Tear It Apart\\" do ample damage even without pinpoint accuracy. This is volatile stuff, and no matter what label name is on the casing, the blowup is all Hives.
B00005JL2O|5.0|Austin Powers has outdone himself in Goldmember.  This was one movie that I wanted to see over and over in the theatres.  It's just that good.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Last December, I stepped into the cinema a Tolkien newbie, knowing only a rough plot summary of the movie. Now what I recall from my first viewing, other than the impressive effects and memorable images is myself saying to my friend, 'Maybe I should get the soundtrack' a while into the film. 2 hours later, towards the end, my friend started continuously telling me 'You really SHOULD get the soundtrack.'<br />I did get the soundtrack and absolutely loved it. Keeping in mind that this is part one of three, I don't mind that certain themes: the ring theme, Minas Tirith theme, were not featured in the disc. We would get our fill in the following 2 CDs, I'm sure. <br />This soundtrack was perfect for the movie, and also stands alone as a piece of art and as beautiful music.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album definitly sounds like the sequal to Toxicity, but there seems to be a larger variety in music style.  There seems to be a song here for everybody, whether you like it slow, fast, harsh, soft, serious, or goofy it's in here.  Get it now!  Allow me to repeat myself, Get it now!  One more time, Get it now!  Why are you still reading this Get it now!
B00005ABX0|5.0|Buy this album or borrow it.  Then sit on the floor and listen to it in headphones.  All the way through.  At least Smiley, and maybe he whole disc.  Listen to all the parts.  You'll hear incredible soul and inflection even in the most &quot;throwaway&quot; harmony parts and barely audible vocals.  This is one of the greatest vocal acheivements ever - and the instruments are great, too.  <br />Ignore whatever anyone says about Smile or any other album - even this one.
B000002AGM|5.0|It is indeed a miracle that Davis and arranger/orchestrator Gil Evans managed to produce such truly great and fulfilling music together. The two were absolutely perfectly matched in their musicianship, and this recording, like the others they did (e.g. \\"Porgy and Bess\\"), shows how. One would not have thought that Kurt Weil's \\"My Ship\\" could sound like this, but it does, and just as gratifyingly, in its own way, as the original. \\"The Duke\\" is another great track, or \\"Miles Ahead\\" - but where does one stop? On a desert island, or - more prosaically - in my living room, I play this with at least as much satisfaction as \\"Kind of Blue\\", unsurpassed though that is. What greater praise can one give? Except perhaps to say that if you like to hear Davis both with a big orchestra and in a small group, you could hardly do better than listening  to this recording and \\"Kind of Blue\\" again and again, which does not mean that the  other Davis-Evans recordings are any less good. - Joost Daalder

B00005614M|5.0|This was certainly a very original recording, and has had heaps of praise lavished upon it ever since people became aware of its importance. It is to my mind especially remarkable for its orchestration, which was ground-breaking, and hugely accomplished as well as new in invention. But even at this level the music, excellent though it is, fills me with intellectual  respect rather than that  I genuinely LIKE it, which sounds almost like blasphemy to utter, and especially because I so much admire Davis, Mulligan, Evans and Lewis in other contexts. Outside the arrangements for the group, there are good but somewhat unexciting - and very short - solos. In the end one's emotional judgement really becomes a matter of subjectivity. I must confess that this is an impeccable work, and for those whose taste it is it cannot easily be over-recommended. If I fail to respond with true ardour, the fault may well be mine. - Joost Daalder

B000075BFK|5.0|2PAC IS STILL THE BEST RAPPER EVER AND HE PROVES IT WITH THIS CD.I GOT IT THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT AT 6AM BEFORE I WENT TO SCHOOL AND IT WAS WORTH IT.THIS IS ONE OF HIS BEST CDS EVER.
B00007E8V4|5.0|It seems like we've been waiting forever in anticipation for the new SOAD album, and what we got is not a disappointment.  Although \\"Steal this Album\\" is not their official new album, it is a collection of B-sides and outtakes from \\"Toxicity\\".  It seems that a number of these songs somehow made it to the internet but were not cleaned up yet, so System decided to release better quality versions of those songs on one CD.  \\"Innervision\\" is already one of my favorite SOAD songs, and a few songs have appeared before on soundtracks such as \\"The Scorpion King\\".  Pick this one up to retain sanity until the next one comes out....
B000075BFK|5.0|this album is by far the most antisipated release since the start of the death row revolution and it sounds amazing almost asif it was recorded months ago it is new but still keeps the pac inside of things by far the best album ever put out by shaqur
0316666343|5.0|The novel The Lovely Bones is crafty, well written, even funny at times, but don't be naive and dive in unknowingly.  While the story, told by the dead after being raped and murdered Susie, revolves around a mourning family and an odd serial killer you will have those un-nerving details unfold that will be a bit uncomfortable for some.  <br />I could not put this book down once I began it, and my husband had me read some of it to him, then we would discuss the strange things going on and the way things were coming together.  While it is described as a 'coming of age' novel, this is done by proxy through Susie's living sister.  I have to admit, parts of this book ripped my heart up, but that is what makes it so amazing.  You feel every emotion, fear, happiness, love, sympathy, anger- it is all there without feeling extremely HEAVY.  If you read a lot, and can handle a bit of gore, I suspect you will like this book, pass it on, and discuss it for many days to come.  The ending really ties things together, I think, in a nice, but not too perfect, way.  <br />If you are in a book club, and your members can handle a bit of darkness packed with awesome writing, do not pass this one up.  <BR>If you are a bit of a bibliophile (like me) and love to buy, read, collect and re-read books, this might be a fun one to add to your shelf.
B000075BFK|5.0|I was a litle worried that this cd was going to be a repeat of Until the End of Time...which i felt was not well produced or thought out. But when i listened to it for the first time I was in awe of how good it really was...I feel that this album exemplifies what 2Pac was all about; his passion for music as well as his passion to make a change in the world. I think that this album will prove the people who see 2Pac as a hood or a menace, or a bad influence wrong. People perceive him as a violent person when, in fact, he was the opposite, and this album shows it. If this were to be the last 2pac album ever(which it won't) it would be a a very nice way to end his legacy. RIP
630463949X|5.0|I havn't been a Fleetwood Mac fan for very long, being that I am just a teenager, but my parents have been fans forever and they got me into Fleetwood Mac.  The Dance rocks, Lindsey, Christine, and Stevie sound amazing.  I love Stevies voice on Rhiannon and Silver Springs.  Lindsey steals the show with his guitar preformances, and John McVie actually sings back up on Say that you love me!! This is a must have for Fleetwood Mac fans!!
0441003257|5.0|Laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish.  If you love Monty Python, if you love \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", and if you love \\"The Omen\\", (and people are always telling you to lighten the hell up) - DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK!!!    Word is that cinematic genius Terry Gilliam has been trying to get a film version of this off the ground - this could easily end up as his best film yet.  Gilliam is the only filmmaker capable of capturing and translating this inspired lunacy to the big screen.
B00006RU5B|1.0|Sure. Some of these songs are a little catchy. But honestly, how did Chris Cornell think this was a good idea?  Audioslave is Rage doing a Nickelback impression and Chris Cornell writing lyrics straight out of the late 90s mold of horrible, devirative hard rock like 3 Doors Down, or god, even Creed.  The horror.<br />If you were ever a fan of ANY of these musicians, do yourself a favor and never buy this.  The originals are ripping off the rip offs.  Aye curumba.
B00006X06U|3.0|Someone once said that art that offends no-one isn't really art. This recording proves that. It is pleasing and disturbing at the same time.<br />I have all of Joni Mitchells's recordings. Since I prefer the Miles Davis-inspired albums, this one works for me, musically and artistically. What is unsettling is the over-the-top full orchestra arrangements and Joni's now-limited voice range. For reasons that elude me, as they age, many singers seem to want full orchestra back-up. I'm thinking of the late recordings of Billie Holliday, recent Shirley Horn recordings and Sinatra recordings where the orchestra overpowered his failing voice. <br />The unexpected sound of this recording makes it challenging and artistic. In that way she joins an elite group of interesting woman singers like Marianne Faithful and Pattie Smith, although Mitchell is far more the poet and musician. She is a real artist who challenges herself not to repeat herself. She isn't satisfied in making things pleasing. I am not sure,however,  that the post-modern spin on her earlier songs does them or her justice. I get the feeling that the music arranger and coproducer controlled the sessions, which I am sure was not the case. <br />I miss the lonely guitar work and the voice that had maturity yet didn't seem to be straining. If you are wanting the Joni Mitchell sound of the past, you'll find this recording foreign.
B00005NRN9|2.0|This movie was well worth the NYC $10 I paid to see it in the IMAX theater. However, that was because it was in 3D!!! It was beautifully amazing with 3D glasses and for $10 I didn't mind that it was only 40 minutes long.  But this is definitely not worth the money you pay on here, unless they give you 3D glasses with it and you can see it how it should be seen!
B00005LQ04|5.0|Suspiria is definately one of the scariest movies ever made, and this is the definitive version. The 3 disc Suspiria gives you all even the Goblin music from the movie!!! This movie will definately mess you up. Don't listen to any bad reviews, because they are lying through there teeth and trying to trick you out of buying one of the scariest movies ever made! I would recommend this one to anyone who is in need of a good scare! Also think about buying The Exorcist, The Changeling, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Rosemary's Baby while you are here. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did. Watch it alone in the dark, and prepare for a scare!
0380977788|4.0|I'm fan of Gaiman's adult fiction and really liked this nightmarish children's tale. Lots of fun. It reminded me of an old \\"Twilight Zone\\" in which the kids get caught in another dimension inside a cabinet.
B00006NSGX|5.0|I saw EC in Boston on this tour, and <BR>I was blown away by the quality of his vocals, this from a guy who felt he had no voice while rockin in Cream.  Listen to his croonin on I Want a Little Girl.  And Badge, thank goodness, is longer than the original, and Clapton's guitar easily dances over George Harrison's lick in the original.  His most recent offerings from Reptile sound so much better live, without the electronic percussion on the studio version.  And My Father's Eyes could not have sounded any better. I have about four of EC's albums, but having this live version marks the highest point of his career.  A must have!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I met Norah about 2 years ago back in Boston through a musician friend of mine. He told me her father was Ravi Shankar but that it wasn't something she wanted to capitalize on.  I also recalled Shankar was touring with his other daughter Anoushka and I felt bad for Norah. I felt bad because Anoushka was getting all this publicity as Ravi's daughter and I felt Norah was incredibly talented and deserved publicity too.  Well, she's getting it now and she did it on her own - without riding on daddy's coattails because she obviously doesn't need to. It's like a Cinderella story without the pumpkin and fairy godmother, and the prince, glass slippers, etc.  And I'm not saying Anoushka is an evil step sister nor is she less talented. Being a singer myself and growing up in the shadow of a sister who was the designated singer/musician \\"star\\" in the family, let's just say I can sort of relate.  Nevertheless, I'm so happy for Norah and I hope she continues to blow us away with that fantastic voice of hers and the great selection of tunes she chooses to record. I'm anxious to hear more of her own stuff in upcoming releases.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I think this album is one of the best. I love System of a down\\" all their albums are the best even this one...Love you guys!! u guys are the best. Keep it up! I love this new one too!...
0140135154|2.0|If you want your eyes and mind opened to beauty and meaning, try \\"The Nude\\" by Kenneth Clark. If you want a tedious specimen of what Harold Bloom calls \\"the school of resentment,\\" this is just the thing.
B000002AGY|5.0|As the other reviewers have said, it's the title piece that makes this disc not only worth having, but absolutely essential.  To be honest, although Jim Hall is a technically great guitarist, I find most of his work unexciting in comparison to Wes Montgomery or even the early George Benson and Grant Green.  But Concierto is his finest hour.  If he never played another note, his place in the Jazz Hall of Fame (if there is such a thing) is assured.<br />Paul Desmond and Chet Baker are a match made in heaven, though I can't imagine two more different personalities collaborating on a musical project.  Sir Roland Hanna's piano solo is exquisite, and Ron Carter's bass complements the piece perfectly. <br />Unlike one reviewer here, I find the sound quality quite good for something recorded in 1975.  I would love to hear an audio DVD of this, but I guess that's too much to hope for.
B000002ADT|5.0|Saying more about this album than has been said is simply gilding the lily.  This is an important jazz album.  It's not, however, the only jazz album nor necessarily the most important album that Miles made--you might also want to try &quot;'Round About Midnight&quot; and &quot;Milestones&quot; and see if you like them enough to move to the great quintet sides with Herbie Hancock, Tony Williams, Ron Carter, and Wayne Shorter. Start here if you will; having this disc in your collection is mandatory, particularly if you want to be perceived as hip.  &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is a great album, but not an end all.  The greatness in the album is in part in the modal innovations introduced by pianist Bill Evans.  The Evans-Davis collaborations have been discussed at length.  Evans plays on &quot;So What?&quot; &quot;Blue in Green,&quot; &quot;All Blues,&quot; and &quot;Flamenco Sketches.&quot;  This neither diminishes nor compromises the importance of John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderly.  Coltrane was developing his unique style; Adderly's connection to blues roots balanced the quartet--the personnel define the music, and the music was innovative.

B00006CXGM|5.0|Okay...where to start...Guy Ritchie's camera work and script are tight and intense.  The dialogue's very well-written and quoteable.  The acting is great, especially Brad Pitt's turn as a barely understandable gypsy boxer.  Jason Statham (Turkish) has built a burgeoning career off his two Ritchie movies, and it's well-deserved.  Dennis Farina and Vinnie Jones are great in their roles, and Benicio del Toro does well in his rather understated role.  Rade Sherbedgia is hilarious as Boris the Blade.<br />The camera work is excellent.  Guy Ritchie uses some great camera techniques that work well and really throw you into the movie.  The soundtrack is varied and excellent.  You won't see a song from The Specials and an Oasis song on one soundtrack very often.  The music is used very well and sets the tone and pacing for the scene.  The sound quality is excellent, and the transfer, even on the regular release, is one of the better ones I've seen.<br />The special features are interesting...not too involving, but some of the deleted scenes are hilarious and really should've made the final cut of the movie.<br />I'd recommend at least renting this movie.  It's not for everyone, but it's got classic British humor and a twisting plot that's really several sub-plots that end up being tied together in one scene and then branch back out again.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|Ok i`m writing this review from the perspective of it original release . Yes its the working mans best of KANSAS, It features some outstanding tracks Like Carry on wayward son , Dust in the Wind, Hold on, A song for America and of course one of the best KANSAS songs ever, The wall. I`m not a big fan of play the game tonight and fight fire with fire, but over all I think this is a great CD and for the new KANSAS fan and for the casual KANSAS fan its a must. Its the kind of KANSAS CD you can just peg back and let it flow, its not a true representation of the great band KANSAS is, as we all know it would have included Magnum opus, and also Cheyenne anthem plus lots of other great songs, but i think if it gets down to just one disc this was a pleasing result. One thing, what gives with that rather ordinary Perfect lover ? I definatly don`t think it should be on a Best of KANSAS CD, its an average song that would be better placed on an 80`s Judas priest record. The original release of this CD had dodgy remixes of Carry on wayward son and The wall (they were muddy and they echoed) and it didn`t contain The pinnacle or the live version of Closet chronicles. This was my review of the old original release of this cd. with the changes that have been made to the new remarsterd version I`m going to have to say its fantastic value and perfect for new KANSAS fans.
B00005221L|1.0|I saw the special edition Region 2 DTS 2-disc DVD in England. The special edition is so much better and has so many more extras than the plain ol' U.S. region 1 version. First of all, there is an audio commentary by John McTiernan. Second, there is a text commentary! What also makes this a great Special DVD is that it has a second disc! That disc is filled with goodies such as a behind-the-scenes making-of documentary, old and new interviews with the cast and crew, outtakes, a deleted scene, special effects segments, camouflage tests and a text profile of the creature and its weaponry, plus a photo gallery!!! Even the box cover looks better than the Arnie cover!! NOW THAT is a real Predator fans' DVD!
B000075BFK|5.0|Eye think this has a lot of good new stuff. it sounds like it is all new. C what u think about this listen to it and there is a lot of talking in the background. Eye can't make it out but it is trippy. um just 2 tell u 2 bi it.
B000002UAX|4.0|This album would have been better if they had taken all the great songs like \\"Dear Prudence\\",\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\",Happiness is a Warm Gun\\",\\"I`m so tired\\",\\"Yer Blues\\",\\"Sexy Sadie\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" into one cd, but instead we must skip over all the filler.If you want a beatles album with no filler you can buy \\"Abbey Road\\".
B00003CX8Y|4.0|My three year old was on a &quot;Beast&quot; kick for about two weeks.  He had to watch it everyday.  He knew all the parts.  I think that is a sign of a good movie.  He is the target audience and he enjoys it.  My wife likes it too, so I think it meets it's mark.  The sound quality is great and the picture is good.  There are some computer games and a game you can play from your DVD player.  I think that means it has something for everyone.
0609610570|5.0|Having read what other reviewers commented about the book, I wanted to give a different opinion. Management is not rocket science - it is even more difficult. It is difficult because it demands to treat human behaviour like rocket science. When you are analyzing a formula, it is easy to put your finger on the obvious error and eliminate it. Once you are dealing with people emotions interfere. Therefore the demand on rigour and discipline to manage an organization well can not be overestimated. This book really points a spotlight on this aspect of management like no other I have read so far.

B00005UEAR|5.0|This is, as I'm sure you saw, a double album and though both cds are good, the first is definitely the one I like best. It has only five songs, though it is in fact the longer of the 2 cds, clocking in at 54 minutes, so you are far from being shortchanged. This album is the more conventional of the 2, as it is made up of distinctive songs, rather than a flowing suite of music. Of course, as is to be expected, the individual songs are far from conventional. There are a wide variety of styles and influences to be found on the first cd. High speed thrash dominates the brilliant opener, The Glass Prison, while the closer, Disappear, evokes OK Computer-esque desolation, with distant sorrowful piano parts, gentle and understated acoustic guitar, and a strong electric undercurrent produced largely through an unusual variety of keyboard effects. In between we find flowing, pseudo-psychadelic Tool-ish metal on The Great Debate, and stunning interplay of synth string and metal guitar on Misunderstood which is reminiscent of Siamese Dream era Smashing Pumpkins. With all the comparisons one might think this album to be derivative. This isn't true. While it doesn't show us much that has never been done before, it does combine some very disparate and interesting influences all while giving the music a new, distinctive spin, which is about all that should be expected from a band, and is much more than we usually get from most musicians. Each of the 5 songs on here is simply great. I would list the standout tracks, were it not that I'd list 4 of the 5 tracks, with the one other track being Blind Faith, which is still an excellent song, though it is perhaps not quite on the same level as the other 4. Though I have up until recently been strongly opposed to the use of keyboards in rock, and especially metal, I find that Jordan Ruddess is the crux of this half of the cd. The rest of the band is brilliant, to be sure, with the exception of James Labrie, who is sometimes great, occasionally a bit weak, and most of the time pretty good, but not really spectacular, in my mind. While Mike, John and John may be the ones who make these songs excellent, it is frequently Ruddess additions that make them simply astounding. As stated before, the track Misunderstood has possibly the best keyboard/guitar interplay I've ever heard, and the various keyboard effects on Disappear create an emotional reality to the grief depicted in the lyrics that guitars alone could not possibly provide.(As I side note, I don't understand how anyone could listen to that song and claim that DT's music is with out emotion) Ironically, I believe Ruddess's keyboards are largely responsible for the relative weakness of the second cd.(Though it is still good)<br />Simply put, the reason I don't like the second cd as much is that it is nowhere near as metallic as the first. The influence is there, but were all of Dream Theater's albums like this, no one would dream of calling them a prog-metal outfit. The keyboards are given to prominent a role this time, with the guitar frequently being a bit overpowered by them. This tendency is, of course, much more prog-rock then prog-metal So, obviously, if you prefer the straight progressive side of DT, you will most likely prefer the second cd. This cd is essentially a concept album, surrounding mental disease and turmoil, though it is a theme rather than a linear storyline. Unsurprisingly, this cd comes off as a suite of songs rather than a series of completely distinct thoughts. The range of influences on this album is even greater than the first. The jungle drumming and vicious rhythm guitar of War Inside My Head and The Test That Stumped Them All recall thrash once again, but up-beat, gentler tracks like Solitary Shell recall 70's era pop-rock, which I personally don't care for. Alongside these songs are the bizarre, rock-opera esque About To Crash and it's reprise which recall more 70's music, though this time in the hard rock vein, combining up-beat hard rock guitar with lots of piano and some especially melodic vocal work. Grand Finale and Goodnight Kiss are slower, epic feeling ballad type songs. So, what is wrong with this album? Well, I really don't like Solitary Shell. It's just too happy and poppy, with some genuinely hideous and Styx-ian ultra-cheese keyboard krap that makes me very, very upset. I can't stand the chorus either. The first 3 minutes of Goodnight Kiss are excessively wussy for my tastes and unintentionally funny as well.(The lyrics would be unfortunate coming out of any man, and they are flat-out hilarious at some points in this song. Labrie goes way overboard on some lines.) This song is partially redeemed by the excellent instrumental section that makes up the second half, which contains some of the best of Petrucci's always outstanding guitar work. Even if these tracks weren't on the album, the other, less flawed tracks simply aren't as compelling to me as the material on the first cd. Still, it's good, and even if it were terrible, the cost would be worth it for the first cd alone.<br />So, go buy this.ing up-beat hard rock guitar with lots of piano and some especially melodic vocal work.

0385043805|2.0|&quot;Rebecca&quot; was not at all what I expected it to be and I was disappointed.  I expected more of a mystery, more of a mind bending plot, not endless pages of nothing happening.  The &quot;mystery&quot; did not surface until about 75 pages to the end.  The ending deeply confused me and left the story hanging.  Perhaps the &quot;sequels,&quot; which were released more than 50 years after &quot;Rebecca&quot; was published, will make things clearer.  I do not recommend.
B000075BFK|4.0|Not a bad release, although the 2nd disc is far better then the first, in my opinion.  The title track is one of the best, featuring Ronald Isley.  Another standout is Military Minds, from the unfortunately unreleased &quot;One Nation&quot; project.  My third favorite track is the best one on the first cd, &quot;Changed Man.&quot;  I would actually only give it 3.5 stars if I could.
0440178002|5.0|This book, without question, is my favorite book of all time.  It took quite a lot of convincing from my friends to pick up this 1000+ pager, but once I started the prologue, I couldn't put it down.  It is the kind of book that makes you wish you could read faster so you can find out what happens next, yet also the kind of book you never want to end.  <br />If you're interested in reading a beautifully crafted epic of romance, political intrigue, warcraft... indeed, a study of the human spirit in a brilliantly articulate style... then read this book!  And though you'll have to sacrifice a week or so of your life to get through the seemingly endless pages, it's well worth it!
B00005V1Z0|4.0|Angelina Jolie was the perfect choice to play the video game heroine Lara Croft.  Jolie delivers high-paced action and stunts throughout the film.  She obviously trained long and hard for this role. <br />The movie is loaded with excellent special effects and action sequences.  Sometimes the plot is hard to follow.  Watch this high-paced film.  Its one you will enjoy.
B000067CPX|4.0|I bought this album for the title track, which I heard on internet radio one day.  The disc has some great tunes and melodies, and I'm glad I bought it.  But it won't get a huge amount of replay time in my CD player.  The songs are good, but after a while, the tracks seem to grow stale.  Worth the purchase, but it won't be a classic.
0783230079|4.0|An excellent fantastic comedy with never a dull moment and little known in Europe ( in France at least ). The music is beautiful and the sound quality of the DVD superb. Picture quality is good but film is in widescreen so doesn't fill your whole tv screen. One would have wanted more different language tracks and subtitles than those provided but I suspect the film is destined for an American and not European audience. Anyway, I loved it and could watch it again and again. Resembles in some ways &quot;Ghost Dad&quot; and Heaven Can Wait - Version 2 ( W Beatty )
B00003CX9Q|5.0|This movie is truly an awesome family movie. It has neat special effects plus being thoughtful, caring, exciting, curious-all the good qualities you want in a movie. One of the best all time family movies ever made!!
B000002UAO|3.0|Maybe I'm biased, because I grew up listening to my mom's american version, but I was disappointed when I got a copy of the UK version and found that it was different.  Sure, Drive My Car is a great song, but What Goes On just stinks, and both don't go as well with the rest of the album like It's Only Love and I've Just Seen a Face do (Both are on the UK version of Help).  The american version is more interospective, I think.  Sure you have to buy both albums, but I am going to combine them and burn a copy of the version I like, and I think that the american version should be available on CD to anyone who wants it that way.  I would have given it 5 stars.
B00007E8V4|4.0|System continues to crush every other band out there.  It's refreshing to have a consistently good group out there again.  I'd give this 4 and a half stars if I could.  All but a few of the tracks are stellar.  If its been a long time since you heard an album that was so good it gave you goose bumps, pick this one up.  Of course, you'd have to of already been a fan of System to appreciate this............If you get a chance to see them, go.  It's straight adrenaline.
6305364613|4.0|I've watched this version of Romeo & Juliet quite a few times (I actually participated in a school play of Romeo & Juliet based on this version), and I have to say that Baz has fitted the movie to modern society extremely well. The movie itself would not be good if you are looking for an accurate replay with swords and daggers and extravagant dresses, but I personally think it rises above the other versions because anyone nowadays can relate to it. It's set in our time, and it makes the whole story easier (for me) to follow along with. The men don't fight with swords, they fight with guns (models that are cleverly named Sword 9mm), and the characters don't wear what they would have in the original setting, but clothes that we might wear. It could have happened to your neighbors, for all the setting tells you. On the whole, an excellent movie that I think you'll enjoy.

B000069HKH|5.0|The only musician with the guts and respect to pay homage to the 9/11 tragedy, Bruce not only outdoes himself with his brutally honest observations of changing American issues and values (see DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN), but he also regains the romantic spark he'd apparently lost during his metamorphosis into our favorite rock star (listen to BORN TO RUN and then TUNNEL OF LOVE immediately afterwards).  Bruce is back, better than ever, and this time, he's with the E Street Band.  <BR>&quot;Lonesome Day&quot; opens the set with an upbeat melody drenched in miserable lyrics, bringing back the frustration of trying to be strong and get on with life after such an incredible blow to humanity.  &quot;Into the Fire&quot; is so literal and conjures up images we'd like to forget, but Bruce sings like he's making a tribute.  So sentimental, beautiful, and inspiring all at once.  The perfect therapeutic song, as intense as Marley.  &quot;Empty Sky&quot; continues the theme of an inability to fill a void and deal with the vacancy.  He describes this emptiness as suffocation; &quot;I could barely breathe...just an empty impression in the bed where you used to sleep.&quot;  Bruce describes the feeling as we would, if we could.  The inspiring gospel rendition of &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; also works wonders, even better than the somber acoustic version heard immediately after the tragedy as part of the Concert for NY.  You can listen to &quot;Imagine&quot; and &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot; as much as you want, but these songs (excluding &quot;City of Ruins&quot;) were written in reaction to 9/11, with a caring, human words and a voice we know and trust.
B00007E8V4|1.0|I cant belive SOAD came out with this cd.  Toxicity was 1000000000000000000000000000 times better than this.  These songs end up being annoying and do not show SOADs real talent.  If you see this cd, run away as far and fast as you can.
B00000ILDE|5.0|The movie Aliens is one of those rare instances where the sequel not only expands on a good film, but is superior to the original.  I truly loved watching this movie, and have fond memories of this film when I first saw it in the theater.  I jumped out of my seat several times, and was pleasantly surprised by this film in a good way.<br />James Cameron loved the original Alien movie, and you can tell that he loved this movie from the opening moments of this sequel that he wrote and directed.  The emergency shuttle that Ripley escaped from the Nostromo in the previous film looks exactly like the same ship in every way.  The attention to continuity is shown not only in the sets, but also in the story, as Ripley looks at photos of people from the previous crew as she testifies to the infamous corporate leaders about her first encounter with the alien.<br />I won't go into detail what happens next in the film, only that just when things look bad, they get even worse.  The additional 17 minutes added to the film on DVD are good, but aren't essential because the story is just as good either way.  The supporting cast that make up the Colonial Marines are a well balanced, well thought out cast.  They all really do stand out as individuals in this movie.  When Gene Roddenberry had started work on the new Star Trek series, he screened this movie to help him and his team to come up with ideas for characters for what would become Star Trek: The Next Generation.<br />The themes in this movie are the same as the original, only better -- the distrust the common people have for the corporate world -- Ripley standing up to the injustices done to those who are victimized.  Sigourney Weaver is a wonderful heroine.  When I saw this movie in the theater, I remember the audience cheering loudly for her.  This was a great movie.
0140177396|5.0|When you are feeling bad, Steinbeck is NOT the author to read. It really is a shame that most people don't read anything more of his than Grapes of Wrath (which is a great novel, don't get me wrong). This is an incredibly short read, hardly more then a short story, barely a novella, and yet it packs an emotional punch that only Steinbeck can manage. It's the story of George and Lennie, two down troden men in the California of the 30's. Like so many others, they dream of having a parcel of land for themselves. They're simple dream is really a desire to end the economic inequalities and maladies that plague their society. But when it comes down to it, Of Mice and Men is a a story of humanity, simple beautiful, brutal humanity. Lennie and George are shown the best and worst of man. They take part, in their morally ambigous way, in the good and ill of society. They are painfully sympathetic and you feel more emotional connected to them at the end of a short 120 pages then you would have thought possible. I implore everyone who reads to set aside an hour or two to read this powerful little book that will caused you to question all your previously held beliefs in regard to morality and humanity.
B00006LLNV|5.0|The singing of the 82-year old Costa Rican / Mexican singer Chavela Vargas was a true revelation - both 'Paloma Negra' and 'La Lllorona' are exquisitely rendered. Chavela had been a part of the lives of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, and is shown singing towards the end of the film. Great soundtrack overall - the theme music (tracks 2, 15) is beautiful.
B00006M183|2.0|I am amazed that this CD has gotten such good reviews.  I have been a long-time listener of Pearl Jam, and have appreciated each stage of their career up to this point.  I have been impressed by the consistent quality of their work, their ability to succeed with different styles of music, and certainly by the intelligent and challenging nature of their lyrics.  This album has at least this last bit going for it--the songs are informed by a spiritual and social consciousness that is rare in rock these days.  But the songs, from a musical standpoint (excepting three or four out of the thirteen), are just plain bad.  I liken them to dirges that just weigh heavily on the listener--you keep hoping for some glimpse of melody, some redeemable thing that will make the song worthwhile, but are continually frustrated.  I painfully listened to the CD three or four times, trying hard to appreciate it, but finally shelved it, where it will most likely stay for a long time.
0679720200|2.0|The Stranger is worth reading once, but only once. Unlike a truly great novel, it does not merit re-reading at different passages of life. The style, as spare as Hemingway's but even less resonant, has no extensive passages of lyric beauty; the characters, even the eponymous protagonist, remain essentially ciphers, dim images about whom the reader can scarcely be compelled to care; even the existentialist theme was more vividly communicated in Camus' essay \\"Le Mythe de Sisyphe\\". The Stranger is gratifyingly brief, and it is only this brevity that saves it from being banal.<br />In almost precisely the same manner as the dramas (?) of Beckett, this novel is deemed valuable not by anything contained within it, but by the protracted labors of a half century of existentialist afficionados, in both the literary establishment and Academia, who were marked by the absurdist ethic in some inchoate fashion that was unigue to their times. Auschwitz, Hiroshima, Mutually Assured Destruction, gave existentialist questions an intellectual cachet that struck a certain chord in a 1950's America essentially middle-brow in its cultural aspirations (much like Zen with the contemporaneous Beats), but the absurd hero has less to say to a world that worships the new gods of the global marketplace.<br />The novel is not particularly realistic, more like the hazy dream of an opium smoker than a genuine portrayal of reality. What defense attorney, or judge, would allow the defendant's behavior at his mother's funeral to be entered into evidence at a capital trial? This element of absurdity or ridiculousness emphasizes the theme, but it also transmutes The Stranger from a novel into a fantasy, an unrealistic fable with a doctrinaire, existentialist moral. If you want to read something Kafkaesque, read Kafka.
1565847032|5.0|This book is a great addition to the library of someone interested in unearthing the truth about the world around them.  One need not agree with Chomsky to identify the rigor of his arguments.  This very accessible composition invites the reader to evaluate the professor's logical connections for themselves.  In the end, it is a book from the other side of media showmanship and government advertisement, pointing to a authentically horrible side of American political and historical reality.  For this reason, Chomsky's words are worth consideration.
B000022TT4|2.0|I'm a relatively new U2 fan who only became an obsessive after All That You Can't Leave Behind, so I wasn't really around when this movie was released. But watching it now I can sort of understand why the critics ripped into it so badly at the time. Make no mistakes, there are still some incredibly powerful moments and performances to be found, such as the blistering performance of Sunday Bloody Sunday, swaggering Helter Skelter and ever-transcendent Bad. Unfortunately, one could almost get a feeling that the band went into this project with an aim to make themselves look as dour and humourless as humanly possible. They come off as overly serious and distant, and if I saw the film without any knowledge of U2 I'd probably be left with a feeling that I was watching the world's dullest band. For a U2 experience, I'd recommend about any other concert video they've done, with ZooTV and Elevation being the top picks.
B00006X06U|5.0|this album is wonderful. maybe a little bit daunting at first, but the payoff is big... here we see Joni translating her compositions into modern art-song. I don't think we'll ever throw away the old recordings, but this set might just be the one that ages best.<br />something I don't understand: for all the hatred of record companies and the music business she's got, I can't imagine why she just doesn't put together a group of great musicians and record her tunes the way she wants them. maybe she's just done with her contract? but she can sell it on the internet or on some small indie label. the advantages of having a major label behind you are mainly advertising. in the end, I'm sure, the people that are going to buy her records will buy them no matter what. so, Joni, call Dave Douglas and some other guys and get some new music happening ASAP!

0142002038|2.0|Ian Fleming at his best is the best, but this book is quite poor. Only this one and Live and Let Die are inferior to the film versions, in my opinion. Fleming's writing itself is superb as ever, but the plot here is weak, as though he is making it up as he goes along. Particularly bad is the scene with Honey and Bond half way through the novel, which is really corny. And you wonder why a trained spy would go so close to the mechanical dragon that he is in the line of its flames. Surely, he would have kept himself hidden at that point?! The desciptions of Jamaica and Quarrel's character are good, but the whole thing lack any real suspense.
B00006V9A0|3.0|Nirvana was not a band that had a bunch of 'greatest hits'. Yes, you have 'teen spirit, 'come as you are', 'lithium' and maybe a couple other that cracked the top 20. But what about the rest of the tracks? Who choose them and why? No 'Polly', 'Serve the servants'; only 14 tracks? Lately some artists have allowed their fans to chose the album tracks for their 'hits' compilations, and guess what, the compilations work. Not only they work but they are certified if you could say so, by the people who care about the artist or know about the band. At this point, I'd rather have a compilation made by Nirvana fans than by Courtney Love.
B000069HK2|5.0|Utah punk is the best freaking punk, the used are awesome, if you do not buy this cd you are stupid, it is awesome, the guys are awesome and freaking awesome in concert. get the CD, go to thier concerts!
B00006L3S3|4.0|I think this album actually departs from the sound and mood of albums like Plastic Ono band and Imagine. This is Lennon trying to conjure that 'feel good' positive spirit of the early Beatles albums like 'A hard's days night'. You wont find any songs that match 'Imagine' or 'Working Class hero' here, but still, some nice songs to cheer you up. I have always thought of it as a 'light' Lennon album, but a good one. I agree, it is underrated.
B00005YW4H|2.0|She's got a good voice, and she can play -- but this just about puts me to sleep.  Buy this and you'll never need to buy Sominex again.
B000075BFK|5.0|This album is pretty good. The album has about 7 tracks that are excellent or top-notch. This album will remind you of the lyrical talent that Tupac had or what the current rap industry is missing.
0385503954|3.0|The first 200 pages of this 350-page novel are a boring stream of consciousness from several uninteresting and unsympathetic characters.  Only later, in this novel within a novel, do we learn that this section represents a first novel, written by the main character, which was rejected by the publisher for its lack of plot and character.  The author should have listened to his own advice!  Instead, he was caught up in the cuteness of demonstrating the evolution of the main character's writing abilities - at the reader's expense.  The rest of the book is fairly compelling and worthwhile, but a little too caught up in the idea of its own importance.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This is a great collection of Stevie's best songs.  I would highly recommend it.  It's one of those CD's you can listen to all the time and not get tired of.  What an awesome talent he is!
B00006CXSS|5.0|My father was one of these paratroopers during WWII and it moved me profoundly.  I cried and cried watching this, having heard about it firsthand from my father.<br />I am sending this DVD for Christmas to my son and his own little boy, as this is their heritage. In a way, it's every American's heritage.
B000075BFK|5.0|This album by 2 Pac has more than impressed me.  i rate it 5 stars because 2 Pac has the lyrics, the style, and the talent to beat any rapper out there.  I did not need to listen to a little sample of Pac's new release, for anything he has to say would be worth the money.  Pac is the greatest rapper who ever lived, the sounds and images that his lyrics create will carry on forever...until the end of time.
B00006RU5B|1.0|I first want to say that R.A.T.M was one of my favorite bands of all time, and still is. I loved their purposeful lyrics mixed with the distinctive R.A.T.M sound. I think that Zach WAS R.A.T.M, and as soon as he left I knew the band couldn't live on without him. The way he sang with his raspy voice you could feel the hate and rage of the lyrics. And mix that with Tom's crazy guitar playing and you have the unique sound only R.A.T.M could produce.  The band itself still has it, but when you mix their sound with Chris Cornell it is horrible. R.A.T.M was all about the rap/metal sound, and mixing that with Cris Cornell's alt-rock voice doesn't work. I think that these guys will forever be looked at as &quot;the 3 remaining members of R.A.T.M and Soundgarden's lead singer&quot; and never just the band Audioslave. I don't see this band lasting for a little more than a year. P.S- that name is horrible, is that the best they could come up with?
B00007BHOE|5.0|Very amazing performance, you can see different angles of the show, and also you can see what all the members of the band are watching, 'cause all of them have a mini-cameras in their masks. Perfect edition, sound and image. Attractive graphics, they did an excellent job with this masterpiece or should i say...disasterpiece? stay (sic) maggots!!!<br />(I don't know about the rest of the people, but i can't see this DVD in my DVD-ROM, i don't know why, but i can see all the DVD's that i have in my computer, except for this one, it's weird, if i insert any of the 2 cd's a \\"error message\\" appears on the screen. I can only see this DVD on a DVD Player. [I wonder if this is a common problem?])
B00006JL1Z|3.0|...as in, recycling the same material, over and over... plus, it would have forced them to include Christine McVie's best song, which for some reason they didn't (and what about &quot;Beautiful Child&quot;?). Of course they did include &quot;Sara&quot;, which means that the full-length version of that song can now be found on a Greatest Hits album, a boxed set, and this anthology, but STILL NOT on the cd of _Tusk_ (ARE YOU LISTENING WARNER BROS?????).<br />All I can say is, record companies really are a desperate lot these days. <BR>&quot;Sure, this material has all been in existence for 10 years or longer, but now you get to have all (read: some) of your favorites in one place! Aren't we imaginative?&quot; <BR>No, you're not. Imaginative would be someone making the effort (and laying out the $) to do a unified Peter Green era best-of, with all the studio versions. Imaginative would be a compilation covering the &quot;lost years&quot; between the departure of Mr. Manalishi and the arrival of the Wonder Twins. This anthology is not imaginative at all.<br />But - lest I leave without saying anything nice..... I have longed to own a recording of Lindsay doing &quot;Go Insane&quot; accoustically for quite some time now. Guess I'll have to borrow this from someone...
B00004T9UF|5.0|As good as the Slim shady LP and the Eminem Show were,this is the best of the three.I got this the first day it came out,and I still listen to it non stop.Here is my review:<br />1.P.S.A. 2000-(4/5)The funniest P.S.A. ever<br />2.Kill You-(5/5)...<br />3.Stan-(5/5)The fictional story about an obsessed fan.<br />4.Paul-(0/5)It's ten seconds long.It's boring and it's not funny.<br />5.Who Knew-(5/5)It talks about how his music has made an impact on kids.<br />6.Steve Berman-(3/5)Someone is cursing out Eminem because he hates this record.This guy needs to be shot(oh wait,that happens on the Eminem Show).<br />7.Way I Am-(5/5)You all know this one.It's one of the best songs.<br />8.Real Slim Shady-(5/5)You all know this one too.Very similar to the first singles on Slim Shady LP(\\"My Name Is\\")and Eminem Show(\\"Without Me\\")<br />9.Remember Me-(3/5)My least favorite on the cd.The first guy who raps sounds like a priest trying to get the demon out of a child.Still worth checking out though.<br />10.I'm Back-(5/5)I like this song.<br />11.Marshall Mathers-(5/5)The best song on the cd with disses on NSYNC,Britney Spears,New kids On The Block,etc.<br />12.Ken Kaniff-(-10/5)'Nuff said.<br />13.Drug Ballad-(5/5)My 3rd favorite song.It's basically about doing drugs.A very good song.<br />14.Amityville-(5/5)It's weird,but it's still good.<br />15.B Please 2-(5/5)Outshines the original.<br />16.Kim-(5/5)This is the most physcotic song on this cd.It's about him killing his wife.It's crazy.2nd best song.<br />17.Under The Influence-(5/5)Weird,but funny to listen to.<br />18.Criminal-(5/5)4th best song.It's about how people acuse him of a crime everytime he writes a rhyme.<br />This cd is good.At least give it a listen before you start complaining about this cd.People are always on here complaining about the language.It's an Eminem cd,what do you expect?And why do you think they put a parental advisory sticker on this?People,if you are offended by bad language,then listen to another cd.But if you are an open minded music listener ready to listen to something good,then give the Marshall Mathers LP a try.It's definitely Eminem's best.<br />Best Songs:Marshall Mathers,Kim,Drug Ballad,Criminal,Kill You,Way I Am.<br />Worst Song:Remember Me he  expresses amazement over his sudden and overwhelming popularity in songs  like \\"Who Knew\\" and \\"Marshall Mathers\\".  <br /> On the whole, Eminem  preaches to his audience that fame is a bunch of bull and he won't be a  party to it, no matter how much money or attention his music garners.  He  begs us listeners to not take his angry innuendo so seriously, but his  boy-who-cried-wolf act is not exactly a comprehensible tactic.  To sum it  up, he's a clear-cut, brutally honest individual who could give a damn if  the whole world despised him, so long as his daughter Haley grows up to be  a well-adjusted young lady.  We praise you for your bravery, Em.  Just  don't make too many people mad...
B00007E8V4|4.0|Not as good as the Toxicity, but better the there first cd.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Get \\"Steal This Album\\" now! It is a great followup to System of a Down's first self-titled album and their second album \\"Toxicity\\". All of these songs are great, especially Streamline, ...the System, and Innervision. Definetely get this album if you liked either of the first two albums.
B00000IP3S|5.0|What a wonderful album. I enjoy it start to finish. The music is so powerful. The title track, A Past And Future Secret, Born In A Mourning Hall, And The Story Ends, all classic songs. Blind Guardian is one of the best bands of the 90's. Check it out if you want to hear some great music. <BR>Imaginations From The Other Side is a stunning piece of Power Metal history. Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B00005QDW1|4.0|This album was pretty good.  It wasn't quite what I expected.  I am a hard core No Doubt fan, and this seemed to be very different from the previous albums.  It's pretty good all and all, though.  It is well worth the money.
B000063V8T|5.0|The Inner Light makes the purchase of the entire fifth season worthwhile. This episode didn't win a Peabody as one reviewer thought. The Peabody went to TNG for he Big Good-Bye which was presented in the first season. Unquestionably, the Inner Light should have won a Peabody and a bunch of Emmies too. This episode is not just the best of TNG; it is one of the best hours ever put on series television.
B000075BFK|5.0|Better Dayz is one of Tupac best's cd's. If you really take a listen to what he talks about you will realize that he may not actually be dead, but thats something for u to figure out for yourself. If you haven't got this cd yet and your a 2pac fan you definally need to get this cd!!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Imagine this:  Vocals of Soundgarden and the Power of Rage Against the Machine; It's what you'll get.  This CD is a wonderful combination of both sounds.  I highly recommend it for anyone who liked either band.
B00007E8V4|4.0|Yes im the first...ok, theyr back they sound like the same but more serios music then before, i can maybe say more ballads then the 2 first allbums, but they still rule!//Stay metal
B000070WJE|5.0|Robbie Williams SHOULD BE FAMOUS IN THE USA!  In some ways I'm glad he's not, because if the corporate wasteland of our music industry got hold of him, his music would probably start sounding just like everyone else's..<br />That, thankfully, is NOT the case.  This new CD is full of a variety of musical styles - the thumping bassline and absurd egotism of &quot;Handsome Man&quot; - the 70's disco/piano beat of &quot;Hot Fudge&quot; ('The holy ghost and the whole east coast are movin' to LA!).  Feel, the first UK single, is also a highlight.<br />One of my favorite things about RW's music is his honesty and quirky approach to lyrics (thanks in part to help from Guy Chambers) and he doesn't fail to deliver here.. This stuff is not nearly as pop-oriented as Sing When You're Winning (which is also an extremely good CD) and a departure from the swing of Swing When You're Winning, his last CD.  I'd recommend both in addition to this CD, a great new collection of RW songs.<br />If only he'd at least TOUR in the US..
B000062TU1|4.0|...I don't know, it's a kid's movie, I guess they get a lot of enjoyment out of it; but what do I think as an adult?  I am permitted, am I not?  Especially when movies and fad media genre supplant our beleaguered American education system-and we are so inundated by them.  Well, we know there's no such thing as magic, and that movies are where the only magic's made...let's see, and there was some other place..where was it?   But anyway, there is an innocence, a Bed knobs and Broomsticks appeal to the whole mirth, but I'm an adult, miserable for sure, that spark left me a long time ago, and now I only have my darker dimly glowing embers of churl to churn in this night of hollow evil.<br />Gather'round children, I have a different interpretation...  <br />Americans receive from Dr. Chomsky's propaganda filter, a certain measure of what is called psycholinguistic programming.  Now what on earth could that be, pray tell?  Let's just be honest, at this point in the deluge, its all programming of that nature, a sophisticated interleaving targeting demographic anatomies of wet membranous human development factors in the emergent plight of any human being, of or from what ever background, as this weird world is unfolded before their eyes and ears..over the years..and fed to them with little \\"spoonfuls of sugar\\".  Willie Wonka tried to show us how people would become divided, fragmented and particlized for cheapened transmissions through the air waves, a fictitious portrait of mankind hanging over our heads, the surrogate and smothering retort that refuses to see reality, and refuses to hear its cries from beneath.  <br />Education in Great Britain, the famous boarding schools, academies, Oxford, Trinity, are what's really being metaphorically paralleled into this psycholinguistic media dimension of distractions and misdirections.  The places of learning for the elites, from when they were pups...like you dear children...to when they are old, and still philosophizing the tragedy of a world they presume to control and comprehend better than any of us.  They are whom we take our orders from, our betters, all neat and uniformed and speaking the Queen's English.   But Harry Potter doesn't go to school to learn economics, mathematics, social sciences, he's their to flirt with the black art, the necromancy, to make colored smoke plume from pestle and mortar.  Perhaps chemistry, you'd say?  I decline to honor that reply, it should be obvious he doesn't learn a thing at Hogwart; he merely learns to take his place in a school pageant of sorts, caricatures and pecking orders that typify people, their kind, their like, and how from very early on we are all indoctrinated to defer to them, measure them, and accord them those artifices of esteem, class, import, capacity, or altogether any worth whatsoever.  Harry is role playing for you my dears, and he wants to be sure you Don't understand that knowledge is power, literacy is power, a defensive and critical view is power, not any tinctures or incantations he flips with his wand.  <br />But he is flipping a wand, and saying those incantations, he is obscuring the founts of wisdom and making them seem something else isn't he?  Well...illusions are what magic acts are all about.  And that illusion spun for you, is that your betters are sorcerers, capable of what you are not.  Don't even ask, you cannot apply nor afford it.  \\"Know Your Place\\"   That is the most awful thing to hear people say, when after all, they are trying to amuse you, and take your money for it.  Know your place behind the ones front and center, or the One front and center, the modern myth of concern for the \\"idol\\".  This, all movies are about now days.  Harry Potter, the book, is an \\"idol\\".  Brittany Spears, an \\"idoll\\".  You get my point.  There is even a ridiculous program on American tv called, \\"American Idol\\".  With so much idolatry, superstition and such, we regress to a dependence on that medium, the entertainment media, to setthe standard for our enjoyments, rather than go out to find and originate them ourselves, to break from the pack and discover that their charisma is no more valid than anyone else's or our own.  That way, you can always laugh when someone tells you, \\"You're no Harry Potter!\\"  Seems too absurd to conjecture, but one of the favorite illusions of image wrecking spin controllers, is to deny whom they don't like an identity unto their own.  This fools the target quarry, and just for a moment, leaves even them wondering why \\"they're no Harry Potter!\\"  This is all that idolatry really achieves in the end...people harboring behind abstractions and denying who they are or who anybody else is.<br />So...like the good witch Glenda...I'm sprinkling this little snow job on you, to get you to wake up.   Remember that Wicked Witch from The Wizard of OZ:  \\" Puppies, we'll make them sleeeeeeepy, sleeeeeeeeeeep puuuupies...\\"   And remember how Dorothy and her trio of anthropomorphized adult constructions, Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion fell victim to her?  Don't fall asleep saturating yourself with the commercial crop of fad and fancy retail sensation.  Read a book, read Harry Potter, then read something more grown up.  Expand that vocabulary and the view to a world, that even if it lacks the pizzaz of magic acts, is subtly in some respects far more invidious, transmogrified, and darkening.  Avoid the obvious conclusions laid out for you like chum, the polarizing filters mass produced and everywhere you look...yes children...even the red ones, the white ones, the blue ones, and the stars.  Idolatry...idolatry...and  affectation.   What would require such distraction...hmmm?    Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch iluuuuuusions?   \\"Oh My!\\"<br />Abracadabraham Lincoln!<br />Go get that broom from areas of doubt or trepidation you feel overpowered by, the ominous and sinister especially.  Then clean the cobwebs out of your mind and out of your institutions, educational, governmental, or corporate!  We forget how impressionable we are...
B00006RU5B|4.0|the fact that 3/4 of this band was rage against the machine, and that that 3/4 were the music behind the phenomenon, you might expect that this album's music would b just like rage against the machine,yet it is not. it is nice to finally here a big variation in the music of, in my eyes, three of the most talented musicians around. chris cornell's voice, so different from zach de la rocha's that it adds a new dimension to what you might expect from the band. each song is different and all are enjoyable, its an album you should throw yourself into head first and enjoy, and there is not much else you can do apart from that. though i do miss zach de la rocha's hard hitting lyrics, chris cornell sings and rights wonderfully. now we must all sit and wait for zach's solo efforts.
6302765536|3.0|\\"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\\" is basically a carbon copy of the original movie except set in NYC: Kevin's family loses Kevin, Kevin has a blast being on his own but this time in the big city, Kevin befriends a nice, but misunderstood elderly person, and Kevin must once again ensare the bumbling \\"Wet Bandits\\" in a house full of booby traps.  Young children will probably enjoy this movie because it reuses most of the same elements that made the original so immensely popular among kids- a kid outsmarting numerous, nasty adults and a slapstick comedy finale.<br />However, this sequel lacks much of the genuine warmth that made the original \\"Home Alone\\" so universally appealing.  Although the sequel has essentially the same plot, its attempts to recreate the most touching scenes from the original (the parts with Roberts Blossom's \\"Old Man\\") by having Kevin befriend Brenda Fricker's baglady and the recently deceased Eddie Bracken's toystore owner come across as forced and not believeable.  Those scenes are just the most glaring examples of the entire movie's \\"written, directed, and acted by the numbers\\" mentality.  Also, the pratfalls and booby-traps which befall the \\"Wet Bandits\\" at film's end are much more vicious and over-the-top than those used in the orignal- being electrocuted and throwing bricks at someone's head can kill a person.<br />I would recommend this movie to people whose kids can't get enough of Kevin McAllister's adventures, but I would caution them about its cartoonish violence.  For everyone else, I would recommend sticking with the original because the sequel is essentially the same movie except not as fun, warm, or well made.
B00007E8V4|5.0|What to say about the Armenian quartet from Los Angeles? Well, we better not steal it first. First, let's get into why this album was even released. Back when Toxicity was being created, the band obviously had B-Sides and demos. What they did here was basically put finishing touches on it. But, why release it now? The band was upset because the unfinished demos and b-sides were being leaked! That's where you get the album name from. Now, let's find out why rejects are even great songs.<BR>I had my dad go purchase this CD while I was out at school, so I was able to go listen to this as soon as I got home. I put it in my stereo and was pretty much surprised. Everything SOAD is just magnificent, but I, and probably others would think, this album would [be amature] It definitely does not.<BR>The topics of the CD mainly discuss how the media/government controls everything (and that no one can think for themselves), the already open subject of war, and how strong beliefs have changed over the years for the worse (Serj discusses the \\"I don't give a damn\\" attitude about America in track 6). I agree with what they say, except on the stuff I really don't know enough about.<BR>It doesn't seem like this album is entirely hidden though, for I have heard Streamline on the Scorpion King soundtrack, but it also seems like it went through a bit of work (added instrumental back-ups).<BR>Well, to sum everything up, this is a great new album for pretty much everyone's collection, and you don't have to download it all online!
B000002O5L|5.0|This is by far the best Tom Petty solo album produced. Yes Wildflowers rocked up the US, but this one struck a chord with many people. I love all of the songs, including Yer So Bad, a catchy little tune played with a 12 string guitar(!) Most of the FMF work was done via 12 string acoustics and the championed Rickenbacker series. Note: The Traveling Wilburys also contributed to this album on the songs I Won't Back Down (George Harrison and Jeff Lynne) and Zombie Zoo (Roy Orbison and the Trembling Blenders; any relation to the Wilburys?) This album is also a great one to pick up guitar chords with, especially simple tunes like A Face in the Crowd and The Apartment Song.
B0000640VN|5.0|I thought Kate and Leopold was an awesome movie! I love romantic movies and romantic comedies. I fell in love with Leopold as the movie went on! It was the sweetest movie! Anyone who likes movies in the romantic/comedy area will love this. I don't want to say more about the movie because if you are interested you shouldn't read reviews and find out what it's about, you should just watch it! A lot more fun that way!
B00006RU5B|5.0|For... Chris Cornell<BR>For... Rage Against the Machine<br />And for the two entities becoming one, because the result is nothing less than a classic that will outshine other \\"rock\\" bands for years to come. Hats ... off to these fellas!![.]
B0000026T4|5.0|....and discovers -- oooh, this is scary -- SEX! And not the teenage longings of \\"Muscle of Love,\\" either! The smoldering \\"Poison\\" (along with the red-hot video) capture a side of Alice we've never seen/heard before. The title track features witty adlibbling between Alice & Jon Bon Jovi; \\"Only My Heart Talking\\" is a plaintive cry for a lost love and features backup vocals by Steven Tyler (along with a wickedly clever video!) Alice then switches gears with with the obsessive \\"This Maniac's In Love With You,\\" the ultimate love-crazed, sex-starved stalker on the prowl. Female fans of the Master should automatically fall under his spell while listening to this one!
B000075BFK|5.0|hey 2pac's new double cd(another one!), Better Dayz, is probably the best compilation of his unreleased stuff.  all of his other cds released after his death(not Makaveli)contained unreleased material from death row and underground songs. the new cd combines the best of both worlds, and it comes out great. with great guest appearances from The Outlawz, Nas, and other rappers, he spreads out his talent well. this cd is bound to go platinum, and it proves that the unreleased music of a deceased man can still compare to the best stuff that new rappers make.  he continues the west coast dominance with this new cd. r.i.p. Pac. ur music lives on
B0000027DJ|5.0|Just when I thought TRASH was the epitome of lustful indulgence, along comes Alice with a follow-up that absolutely explodes in your face -- and eardrums! The Master has outdone himself again (no big surprise there, really); although this time around he's out for bloodthirsty revenge; love has gone completely out of control. In \\"Love's a Loaded Gun\\" he declares, \\"You push me to the limit, I can't take it\\"; while in \\"Burning Our Bed\\" he admits that even \\"Sometimes a man can bleed.\\" \\"Might As Well Be On Mars,\\" the ultimate ballad of unrequited love, shows a sensitive side of Alice that usually stays well-hidden... \\"You've turned my world into a dark and lonely place, like a planet lost in space.\\" Then once again, he jumps back into his usual scowling, ferocious act with \\"Feed My Frankenstein.\\" (Velcro candy? Ice cream cones? Yum, yum! Lead me to the banquet!) The most surprising track on this sexy CD features Steven-remember him?-as a hyperactive, drugged-up child locked away in the \\"quiet room\\" with his delusions. Definitely a must-have!
B00003CXTG|2.0|When I first went to go see this in theatres I was hoping for a historicly accurate, non-stop action war thriller.  What I got was a two hour love story and twenty minutes of the actual battle.  This movie was very disapointing and exceedingly boring for the first hour and a half.<br />The emphasis is soley on the love interest between two hot shot pilots and some navy nurse.  One pilot (who is the boyfriend of the nurse) supposedly dies then his best friend takes over the love interest and gets laid in the parachute hanger with the nurse and makes her pregnant.  Almost the immediatly the so-called 'dead' boyfriend returns and all hell breaks lose between the two pilots.  Oh yeah, then the battle of pearl harbor happens.  Then the two go back to their disputes over who gets the girl.  They never settle their differences as they go off to seek their revenge on Japan by bombing them (which is historicly accurate, also known as the Dolittle Campaign) then the current boyfriend who pregnated the nurse dies (opps, spoiler) and the 'dead' pilot takes over... The End.<br />The point of that is to explain that aside from special effect, their was almost no time and effort script wise spent on the historical relavence of Pearl Harbor which is what the hype previous to the movie's release was all about.  I only give this movie two stars because of the great special effects and nothing more.  However as George Lucas demonstrated in Phantom Mennace, special effects DO NOT make a movie.  All in all I would venture away from this movie and go with a quality, historicly accurate movie like Patton, Black Hawk Down or We Were Soldiers.
B00006LFGD|4.0|It is a treat to Barbra fans worldwide to finally have a duet album released....putting her classic duets on one disk and adding two new tracks, one with the legendary Barry Manilow and the other gem with young opera singer, Josh Groban.  The album takes the listener on an emotional journey.....there is the tender YOU DON'T BRING ME FLOWERS, the rocking disco NO MORE TEARS, the CLASSIC...MAKE NO MISTAKE HE'S MINE with Kim Carnes....great cd....the only complaint I have is in the remastering of the original recordings....they are still not up to modern day sounds and with the technology out there now, it could have been!  But, Barbra's voice is such a gift!
B00006G8LB|5.0|This Movie is Nothing Less than Awesome. The Acting was Perfect, The effects were very well done.This is Vast Improvement over X-Men. The Costumes Were Very Cool. I Believe That Everyone Who Is A Fan of The Comic Book Should See This Movie. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, And The Rest of The Cast Do Outstanding Jobs. Willem Dafoe Is The Greatest Villian I've Ever Seen! The Way He Cackles as The Goblin and The Way His Eyes Look Inside The Goblin Mask Will Give you The Creeps. I Personally Recommend The DVD You Can Learn Everything About The Comic Book and The Movie It's The Best.
B0000542D2|2.0|If I was reviewing only the picture of this dvd, I would rate it 4 or 5 stars.  However, since the sound is simply awful, I can't.  The old MPI video took the orignal recordings of the songs and mixed them back into the movie.  This approach sounded crisp and clear, and more importantly in true stereo (since The Beatles at the time were using 4-track tape).  I'm guessing that Miramax was not allowed access to the masters.  Consequently, their new so-called 5.1 &quot;remix&quot;, had to be built around the original mono track of the film itself.  In other words, any kind of stereoization had to be electronically faked. My initial reaction, when hearing this dvd for the first time, was that all the songs were rerecorded by other musicians.  This is obviously not the case. But the recordings sound so differently from what is expected, I wasn't sure! <BR>   The picture is decent. But what about that reissue prologue and the deleted &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; performance? The dvd producers must have known how long fans have been waiting for this film to be released.  They could have put more time and care into it.  Oh well.  Let's hope Miramax doesn't aquire the rights to HELP!
B000075BFK|5.0|2 Pac's lyrics will always stay true no matter what generation he's droppin' beats for.  His producers keep the beat going with generations.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is is the best CD to be released in the year 2002.  Norah's voice is simply amazing!  If this CD cost me $100.00, I would buy it in a heartbeat!  If you don't have it yet, go get it today.  You won't be sorry!
B00005MP58|5.0|I consider Jane Austen's novel the consummate masterpiece of classic fiction, so the plot and characters are of the highest ilk. As to this production of the story, it's by far the best. All of the actors are excellent; the 5+ hours go by without your noticing, and when you finish watching it, you cannot help but want to start over again, because you can't bear to leave the world that it has created. Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy gives a performance that on first watching seems stiff and restrained. Once you've seen it two or three times, however, :) you start to notice just how much is going on in that multi-layered portrayal, and it's stunning. Jennifer Ehle is the perfect Elizabeth Bennett, and her skill and dignity and beauty make this entire production a pleasure to watch. I can't drool enough about this movie...I've talked as many of my friends as possible into marathon viewing sessions, and they have, without fail, really enjoyed it. This ain't a chick-flick, either: I was most surprised to learn of male aquaintances who thought it was great.
B00007E8V4|4.0|This album, is not as good as SOAD's previous release, Toxicity. The album has a good number of good songs, yet there are a couple ones that just arnt good and detract to the quality of the cd as a whole. They use middle eastern style instruments in a couple of the tracks, which is very cool. Another problem is that this album is chalk full of leftist veiws, way too much. Im not opposed to their views I just think too many in an album detract from the song writing. Their last album had the perfect amount of political views mixed with other inspirational songs. I think they went a little overboard on this one. If you do not have toxicity yet, buy that first. Then look at this one. Its a good cd, dont get me wrong. So if you like soad im sure you will like this cd. Its just not as good as the last. I would of also liked system of a down go a little more hardcore but oh well. Buy it. Or steal it.
0345448898|5.0|I usually dislike science fiction books, but a friend referred me to this book and I changed my mind quickly.  Pullman creates new worlds that are unique and clearly written.  I started reading this book and I could tell right off it was going to be good.  Pullman introduces you to Daemons, animals that follow you around all you life, early on in the book and it was this unique idea that locked me into the plot.  The symbolism in the book is priceless.  Pullman really outdid himself with this one.
B00006RU5B|4.0|The music is excelent.  The singing is really strange. It sounds like ac/dc.  The two just dont go together.  THe music is really good with the exception of the solos.  The bender/wammey effect used are just annoying.  I was a huge rage fan and was slightly disapointed, however, still a great cd.
B00003CWTI|4.0|Magnolia is one of the few movies I have ever seen that can be classfied as pure art.  The movie quickly introduces you to a group of people.  It takes you through there lives in skits.  You will begin to notice that all their lives intertwine in an excellent climax.  Even if the plot does not attract your attention this film is an original and is worth a look.  I gave the movie four because of the ending.  I like for endings to tell me nothing at all or tell me everything.  The ending in this film answers some things and others it leaves unsolved.
B000059HCN|5.0|This film should be required viewing in high schools and colleges across the country to show young people the consequences of using and abusing drugs.  Does this film have a point?  Hell yes, it does: THIS IS WHAT DRUG ADDITION CAN DO TO YOU!  As our society tries its hardest to whitewash and sugarcoat the negative effects of drug addition (\\"Say no to drug [yawn]\\"), this film provides the most realistic depiction I've ever seen of the ugly consequences of shooting up and popping pills. It can either kill you or make you wish you were dead.<br />This film boasts 4-star performances across the board from Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlan Wayans and Jennifer Connelly.  Kudos to director Darren Aronofsky and Artisan Entertainment for greenlighting it.  I hope to see more realistic films like this made in the future.
0440237688|5.0|If you ever wonder what the perfect society would be like read this book.  This book introduces us to the \\"perfect\\" society and the cost which is paid to uphold it.  The book is a lesson to us all that perfection is better left as a idea as opposed to a reality.  Character development is somewhat minimal in this book.  Lowry does a good job with developing the main characters but the others are kind of flat, but don't get me wrong Lowry does a good job considering the length of the book.  The plot is excellent and despite the flat charcters it will get you hooked.
B00003CXXM|1.0|What can I say?  I was enormously disappointed.  I've been a fan of Robert Ludlum for probably 15 years.  This movie was a resonably decent \\"action/adventure\\" -- but it bore little resemblence to the novel I loved.<br />And Matt Damon?  As Jason Bourne?  I don't THINK so!<br />If you want to see a somewhat entertaining example of this genre, rent -- don't buy.  But if you are a purist (or at least like your book to movie translations to be recognizable) you won't care much for this one.
6305841861|5.0|Alright, you needa know somethin' first off.  'Evil Dead 2' is a hit-or-miss affair an' thas' all there is to it; you're either gonna love it for it's humor and gore, or you're gonna hate it for it's humor and gore.  My thinking is that anyone who is a REAL fan of movies, an' that recognizes that we watch movies first and foremost, for entertainment, will more than likely enjoy this.  And I happen to be one'a the latter so I jus' enjoy the hell outta this flick, an' always have.  'Evil Dead 2' took the original to a whole 'nother level completely, an' solidified it as a cult series with a loyal legion of followers.<br />Okay, okay, so the amount of bloodshed an' the relentlessness of the violence has been toned down a bit, but thas' to make way for some over-the-top humor and to help truly shape Bruce Campbell's Ash character into the chainsaw-weilding, shotgun-blasting, ultra-cool, and ultra-CHEESY superhero that we all know an' love.  With this sequel, the filmmakers pulled out all the stops.  They took their shoestring budget, cut a few corners, pulled off a few miracles, an' created what is, in my opinion, one'a the best an' most influential movies of the '80s.<br />Picking up right where the first 'Evil Dead' left off (after a brief rehashing of how this mess began, with a few inaccurate details), this one gets going right away, as Ash, still holed up in the cabin deep in the woods, struggles to defend himself against an ever-growing legion of demonic spirits, while also trying to maintain a grip on his own sanity.  He watches his decapitated girlfriend's corpse rise from her grave an' do a ballet dance, he has a conversation with his own reflection in the mirror (&quot;We jus' cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw... does that sound FINE!?&quot;), then winds up in a murderous brawl with his own hand.  And if that isn't crazy enough, a group of outsiders are on their way to the cabin as all this is happening hoping to translate the lettering in the Book of theDead.  Too late, huh?<br />With an even more clever and fun script than the original, 'Evil Dead 2' will keep you hanging on every word, even when you 'bout to split your side laughing.  Some real interesting revelations come to light regarding Ash an' why he's involved in this, but I don't wanna give it away for those who ain't seen it.  I'll jus' say this; it's no coincidence that Ash has survived this long an' seems to be the lone warrior waging this battle against these bloodthirsty zombies an' demons.  Outside of the story, director Sam Raimi's camerawork is a masterwork in itself, an' you can see how his stylistic approach was quickly developing an' becoming more an' more professional between the first two movies.<br />Anchor Bay gave the DVD special edition of this movie a terrific treatment, the best part of which is the audio commentary from Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, co-writer Scott Spiegel and special make-up effects artist Greg Nicotero.  Now THESE guys know how to make a voice-over interesting an' know how to make you actually WANT to hear it all the way through, because instead'a boring you with mundane details, they entertain you with their camaraderie, their ridiculous on-the-set stories, an' their constant blame placing.  These are not uptight stiffs, these are a bunch'a guys who grew up with working-class families, that were lucky enough to stumble into the world of motion pictures, because they have a real, pure an' unabashed LOVE for cinema.  The featurette 'The Gore the Merrier' is also pretty interesting, if only for the home videos that were taken on the set during filming, an' the theatrical trailer is great.  Even in advertising for the movie, they made it seem like it was a major '80s blockbuster.  There's also a preview for the 'Evil Dead: Hail to the King' video game, as well as a few still galleries, taken from the filmmakers' private collection.  For once, I can happily say that I wasn't at all disappointed by this DVD's extras.<br />Ofthe whole series, I think 'Evil Dead 2' is, by an' large, the best and most entertaining on a horror movie scale.  In fact, y'know what?  I think it's one'a the best sequels EVER made in the history of modern cinema.  It stayed on the level of the original so's to satisfy fans' bloodlust, but it also added some outrageous humor to the mix, an' created one'a the most memorable icons in recent years with Ash.  Well, anyways, don't stop now.  Ya' better go 'head an' pick up 'Army of Darkness' so you can find out what happens to our hero Ash in his seemingly-never ending battle against demonic zombies, rising corpses, an', um, his severed right hand.
B00006CXXU|5.0|There are no words to explain how amazing this album is. It is Christina like you have never seen/heard before. All the songs show the different feelings/sides that she has had. If you don't have this album yet..you don't know how much you are missing =)<BR>I highly, highly recommend this album, you won't regret it!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|well if you have ever heard the clash befor then you already know there awsome.but this is the cd to get if you havent heard them before.this cd is a perfect mix of there punk,reggae,dub,and all around rock style.it is arguably there best album.if you like the clash,or like any of the guanras they are composed of then get it,its a great buy!!
B000008H1U|3.0|For some reason, I dismissed this album when it first came out.<br />Maybe it was because so many people hyped it up so much as a<br />comeback..or maybe because I wasn't too impressed with it upon<br />first or second listen.<br /> Well, I have now seen or heard the errors of my ways, and I think CREST OF A KNAVE is a mighty fine Jethro Tull album. The<br />sound is a bit different..IAN ANDERSON sounds like GORDON LIGHT-<br />FOOT and MARK KNOPFLER and some of the guitar playing is KNOP-<br />FLER-esque..and TULL sound like ZZ TOP on the album's opening<br />cut STEEL MONKEY. These are not complaints, however.<br /> I happen to LOVE the song STEEL MONKEY...it's catchy as all heck, with a very memorable and singalongable vocal from IAN,<br />and some terrific lead guitar playing from MARTIN BARRE. It's one<br />of my all time favorite TULL songs, my only complaint being that<br />it's not long enough!!<br /> The other songs, like FARM ON THE FREEWAY, JUMP START, etc..<br />are also quite enjoyble, and compared to how bad it would sound<br />on later albums, ANDERSON'S singing voice is at the very least<br />tolerable and far from annoying. This album really rocks out in<br />parts and MARTIN BARRE is given ample rooom to solo his buttocks<br />off, but the music is also quite sophisticated and complex at<br />times..and also quite accessible...even tho' I still can't re-<br />member how anything from the second half sounds!<br /> There are reasons this album was hyped up!
B000075BFK|5.0|Although 2Pac is dead, this album is filled with songs recorded 6+ years ago that sound as if they are brand new.  Every single song is perfect.  A lot of people are saying that Eminem is the best rapper ever, and I agree that he is one of the best out there at the moment, but &quot;Better Dayz&quot; digs &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; a grave and buries it.  Some of the highlights are &quot;When We Ride On Our Enemies&quot; where 2Pac spits fire on his enemies once again.  &quot;My Block Remix&quot; and both versions of &quot;Thugz Mansion&quot; are utterly flawless.  Something that will fire up all those who believe that 2Pac is alive is the last track, not shown in the track list.  The 13 second tracks has 2Pac stating that we should expect him to return just like we expect Jesus to return.  Great album.
B000075BFK|3.0|I luv 2pac.  I have all his cds and have downloaded every unreleased song I could find onto my MP3 player.  Almost every single song on this album I downloaded last year.
B00006M183|3.0|I love Pearl Jam but this is a slow, brooding rather monotone compilation that leaves this listener unsatisfied. Like luke-warm, bland pizza this just leaves you feeling like you know it can be much better. After I got this new CD I started listening again to Ten and there is so much more there then in this new recording. I know every effort can't be the best and I'll listen a few more times but....
B000063T0T|5.0|I'm a 14 years old fan of Moulin Rouge. I really love this movie, it's my favorite one, I've seen it almost 30 times! I'm serious.<BR>I love the music on it, it's really awsome, I love how they have mixed old songs with new ones, it sounds really amazing. This is my favorite soundtrack of all. Nicole Kidman (who, by the way is my favorite, favorite actress) sings really really good, I love her voice, it's really natural. And Ewan has a beautiful beautiful voice; together they are just perfect!
0887307280|5.0|I read this book twice in one weekend, and was particularly struck by Chapter 12, where the author really explains his personal journey into understanding small businesses and why they don't work.  I have watched small businesses struggle from the inside for more that 12 years, and if the owners had read this book, they would have saved themselves headache, heartache, and bottom line $$.<br />I have a consulting company that focuses on the needs of small businesses, especially those just getting going.  I give a copy of this book to every one of my clients who says &quot;Gee, I want to start a business...what do I do?&quot;  This book helps clarify both the &quot;what&quot; and the &quot;how&quot;.<br />If you are are the kind of person who has discovered that common sense ain't that common, and agree with the (paraphrased) comment in Michael Hammer's &quot;The Agenda&quot; that the miracle of American business is merely that it functions, this book is the perfect reference.  I found myself saying &quot;yes!&quot; and &quot;Exactly!&quot; as Mr. Gerber took us through the story of a small business owner who had traded the idea of a tyrant boss for a tyrant business.<br />It's a great read, and worth three times the price.
B00007E8V4|5.0|After the release of Toxicity, rumors came out that they were other tracks that were cut from the final album. Later, System of a Down (SOAD), released copies of these songs to lucky fans that got chosen to go backstage with them. I got ahold of the album early (From a friend of a friend who had the CD) and was blown away. Not all the songs were the same as on the official release, but most of them matched up. If you know SOAD, you know their style. They have a tendency to skip around between melodic tunes to absolute noise and death metal-like vocals. They also commonly implament very Arabian and tribal melodies into their music. Here is a little mini review:<br />1. Chic 'N' Stew - This song is amazingly melodic which makes up for the screaming and pointless lyrics.<br />2. Innervision - This is a beautiful song. It is song with power and one of their most rythymic tunes ever. It has very emotional power to it.<br />3. Bubbles - This is a strange song, but like all of theirs, very interesting.<br />4. Boom! - Finally a trully politcal song. SOAD is really in that type of songwriting. The lyrics make a lot of sense really work with the background gituar and drums.<br />5. N-guns - Another awesome song. GO SOAD!!<br />6. A.D.D. - A particullary insulting song. Its such a sad song too. As they sing about the life of the army, a type of sad army tune wails in the background.<br />7. Mr. Jack - I have no idea why it is called this. One of their more melodic songs. Not so much screaming until the last 5 or 6 lines.<br />8. I-E-A-I-A-I-O - Another messed up song. I kind of like it though.<br />9. 36 - A fairly short song, kind of pointless. Its just noisy and doesn't really have too much melody. But, it is not annoying in any way.<br />10. Pictures - One of the fastest songs on the CD. A great display of SOAD'S screwed up singing. Nice song with great tribal musical beats (as in very driving drum loops).<br />11. Highway Song - I always get this screwed up with Mr. Jack.It a great soft song (for SOAD of course)<br />12. F**K the System - How nice. This song is one of the best on the album! The intro riff pulls you into the song. Then Serj's(lead singer) demented singing with high notes (followed by the gituar mimicking him) combined with catchy verse.<br />13. Ego Brain - I don't listen to this song much. Its still good though.<br />14. Thetawaves - Catchy lyrics and tunes. Nice work here.<br />15. Roulette - Wow, this song is the coolest ever. Its beat and gituar are sweet.<br />16. Streamline - Another emotional song. The melody really makes your feel sort of sad. Its beat is very captivating.<br />As with the previous two SOAD albums, they prove to be amazing works of music. SOAD's unique lyrics and music style sets them apart from the others. Get this CD now! (Don't 'Steal this Album' though). One word of caution: 'You either like SOAD or you don't'. As great of a band they are, some people still hate them.

B000066NW0|3.0|I picked up this album because I like the girl's voice. After having listened to the album several times, I have decided that Let Go is kind of hit or miss, overall.<br />The two already released singles (Complicated, Sk8r boi) are okay, and are representative of about half the album. People who like those two singles will find 3 or 4 more songs that will appeal to them on the same level.<br />It's the darker, angstier songs on the album that appeal to me. Whether the girl has any experience in life or not, she sings her songs well, and has an appealing voice.<br />On the down side, there are some songs on the album that aren't good. The chief offender is the pseudo-rap whine fest Nobody's Fool.<br />Overall, I find that I like enough of the album that I can just skip over the few songs I didn't like.
B0000024ZT|5.0|Although Bruce Springsteen became known to the world as a singer/songwriter who wrote story songs embodying the spirit of the disheartened and the downtrodden, it is often forgotten that he started out as a wild, exuberant, and borderline naive artist. His debut album, Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. is a prime example of this youthful enthusiasm. Springsteen belts out lyrics in his raspy, intimitable voice the likes of which had not been seen in rock 'n' roll since Bob Dylan's Blonde On Blonde (fostering the inevitable Dylan comparisons that hound The Boss to this day.) Right from the kick-off of Blinded By The Light (later a big hit for Manfred Mann's Earth Band, but far better in this, the oringal version), it was obvious that a new and very talented singer/songwriter was on the scene: replete with a funky/jazzy rock riff and numerous horns, the song starts out with the lyrics &quot;madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat/in the dumps with the mumps as the adolescant pumps his way into his hat&quot; - and just goes on from there. The arrangements and playing are just as busy as the lyrics, and the playing, while not exactly what you would call tight, is huge-sounding, loose, and feels like it is just barely contained - in other words, the perfect backdrop for these wild lyrical flights of fancy. Despite somewhat hazy production, this remains one of the greatest debut albums of all-time. It has what still rank as some of Springsteen's best songs (Blinded By The Light, Lost In The Flood, Spirit In The Night) - not to mention the all-time classic lyric &quot;nuns run bald through Vatican halls pregnant pleadin' Immaculate Conception.&quot; Although he would later come to be known and treasured as American's bard of the dispossessed, one can look back on this album and hear a Bruce who was just as good, infused instead with a brimming, admirable youthful enthusiasm. Essential Springsteen.
B00002E23E|4.0|I was seeing this flick at midnight screenings prior to its VHS and now DVD releases. I've loved the group for as long as I can remember. Their live shows were stuff of legends. Unfortunately this release was not given the attentive remixing it deserves from the band especially Jimmy Page. As the late, great Peter Grant summized it, \\"It is the most expensive home movie ever made!\\" which I totally agree with his sentiments. The picture quality is very good in widescreen format nonetheless. My complaint is the audio side of it as it comes off tinny. I can only imagine what this would be like remixed in Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS! Never mind that it is sometimes out of sync but it is a mishmash of various shows cobbled together to put out one film. Still a great testament to arguably the greatest rock band of all time!
0316666343|5.0|I think Alice Sebold did a wonderful job when she wrote this book. As a senior in high school, it is hard to find a book at that is both easy to read but interesting.  And Ms. Sebold accomplished that.
B00004YZFR|5.0|A fantastic release of an old favorite! The Rolling Stones aren't just a rock band but an institution ala The Beatles. This documentary of their 1969 Tour is an amazing piece of musical history as it goes from the frenetic Madison Square Garden shows to the Muscle Shoals studio sessions and finally the infamous ill-fated Altamont free concert. Richards and Taylor form a brilliant guitar duo, Wyman and Watts an unshakeable rhythmn section to go with Jagger's frontman genius as evidenced by the fabulous performances. The additional supplements are definitely a treat as well. Now if the venerable Mr. Allen Klein can somehow get himself to release Ladies And Gentlemen...
B00007E8V4|4.0|\\"Steal this Album\\", is not a 'new' album by System of a Down. <br />Obviously, when a band writes music, they don't just write 10 songs and place it on a CD (thank god). \\"Steal this Album\\" are the songs that didn't make it onto Toxicity and their self-titled album, but are as equally good.  <br />The best way to describe this album is schizophrenic.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  From the bouncy entrance song \\"Chic 'N Stu\\", to the acustic \\"Roulette\\", there are many different System of a Down(s). <br />The album is very good, and shows that Toxicity wasn't the only good music the band can put out.  <br />The singles (or projected singles) I believe off this album are: Roulette, Mr. Jack and Intervision.  <br />If you buy this album, buy Toxicity with it -the album is a complement to Toxicity, like I said before.  Hard core System of a Down fans will love this album, Newbees will like Toxicity more. <br />I guess that is all I can say about this, just buy the album and decide yourself.
B00005T343|2.0|Silence of the Lambs was a critically acclaimed success- a compelling, suspenseful, moving movie.  What does the movie studio do?  Try to duplicate the success as quickly as possible to strike while the iron is hot, and create a sequel.  And like most sequels, this movie doesn't live up to the original.<br />Even veteran actor Anthony Hopkins cannot save this movie, in spite of his wonderful performance.  Julianne Moore replaces Jodi Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling, who squares off against Dr. Hannibal, who taunts her from across the Atlantic ocean in obscure ways.  <br />I can almost imagine how the script outline took shape.  The story seems to be the product of anxious Hollywood pitchmen frantically throwing out ideas to a studio executive, grasping for success.   In any event, they have produced a disjointedly contrived story, punctuated with brief scenes of gory violence.  <br />If you must see this movie, rent it.. don't buy it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|AUDIO SLAVE is the band that is going to rock the world of music without a doubt. I thank Chris Cornell and all the members of the band for crafting this album. this is one of the albums that I was waiting for to came out for ages. The album is very lyrical and very melodic and sounds very thrilling, Two thumbs up. Good job Chris, Tim, Brad, and Tom.<br />I'm looking forward to seen you guys on stage.<BR>                                                                                                                                                                                   A.

B00005JLCI|5.0|If there was ever a movie made to experiance on the DVD format, Kenneth Branagh's brilliant unabridged film version of Hamlet is IT. Sadly, the film is only available on VHS though. When I first got a DVD player, this was one of the first films I looked for, sadly in vain. The cast is brilliant, with the exeption of a few pop-up celebrities thrown in as a novelty, but they hardly ruin the film. I listen to the rouring soundtrack often (thank you Patrick Doyle) It brings tears to my eyes.  PLEASE, PLEASE release this film on DVD soon. Just the idea of listening to it in 5.1 DDSS, is enough to give me goosebumps.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Starting where they left off with Toxicity. In fact, I think some of these songs were written and recorded for Toxicity, but were left off. Their usual brand of heavy riffs and sometimes comical lyrics. This is a must buy!!
B00007E8V4|5.0|\\"Steal This Album!\\" is excellent. It's a must buy for anybody who likes System of a Down. <br />\\"Chic 'N' Stu\\" is very fun. If you like Serj Tankian's fast, flip floppy style of singing then you will like this song then you'll like this song. I liked the way Daron just kind of chimes in, echoing Serj.<br />I had a copy of \\"Innervision\\" long before this album was announced. I loved it. I though it was one of SOAD's best songs. I wondered how they could improve this song. They have answered my question. Interweaving vocals make a nice contrast. I wish I had a friend with me to sing the high part along with me.<br />The song \\"Bubbles\\" is classic SOAD. It's just reverberates through your ears, makes your head move up and down and then brings a smile to your face. I love the little voices in the background. My favorite part of SOAD songs, are the little details they put into them. This is a good example of what I'm talking about.<br />\\"Boom!\\" is another SOAD song with a powerful message. It's deep message about war is made clear with the chorus \\"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Everytime you drop the bomb you kill the God your child has born.\\"<br />\\"Nüguns\\" is very similar to Boom!. The first time I heard the track change from Boom! to \\"Nüguns\\" I wasn't sure if it was a different song or if it was just a break in Boom!. \\"Nüguns\\" is also a song with a message about war. The fast guitar playing and smooth vocals are very pleasing.<br />\\"A.D.D. (American Dream Denial)\\" will have you head banging and trying to learn the lyrics. This is the third consecutive track with a message about war on this CD. Don't get me wrong, I don't really care, I just wanted to point that out. This is another example of Serj Tankian's fast pace style of singing.<br />\\"Mr. Jack\\" is a song that is full of contrast. It goes from soft to loud and into an area between the two. I love how the beat of the song just switches without warning.<br />The song \\"I-E-A-I-A-I-O\\" is very catchy. After hearing the chorus the first time through you'll be you'll be singing along with it the second time it rolls around.<br />\\"36\\" is a very short song that just seams to come out of nowhere. It reminds me of the songs Bounce or Shimmy. The pounding drums switching to taps on the cymbal is very pleasing.<br />\\"Highway Song\\" gives me visions of Serj Tankian taking a calm walk in the middle of a tornado while singing this song. He just seems to be so fluid with his vocals while everybody else is playing their heart out.<br />\\"F**k The System\\" is another song I had long before this album was announced. As far as I can tell they didn't change anything. The song is one of my favorite SOAD songs. Listen to this if you want to hear just how wild Serj's vocals can get. The song is one of my favorite SOAD songs. Listen to this if you want to hear just how wild Serj's vocals can get. Once and a while my friends and I will just start singing this song. We love is sooooooooo much.<br />\\"Ego Brain\\" is one of those songs where when it starts your all like \\"Well, they can't all be good.\\" This took me by surprise. It starts out soft and builds up like a rising thunder storm until the lighting cracks and the rain starts pouring with the lyric \\"Ya' see my pain is real.\\"<br />\\"Thetawaves\\" is another song that reminds me of the tornado around Serj. When I hear it I just wonder how SOAD makes songs that are rap-rock, but aren't labeled as rap-rock. I like this song a lot, but the lyrics don't exactly stick with you. That's the only bad thing I can say about this track.<br />I would call \\"Roulette\\" a love ballad. It's just Serj singing and Daron accompanying with vocals and guitar. It's a very satisfying song, but it takes some getting used to.<br />The last song is \\"Streamline\\" (which can also be heard on the Scorpion King Soundtrack). It's very powerful. Full of odd beats that seem to keep doing u-turns. The whole arrangement between the vocals and rhythm make a weird kind of sense, but may take a couple of trys before you can nod your head correctly to the beat.<br />I love this CD. If you haven't already pressed the \\"Add to Shopping Cart\\" button then do it now! The only thing I wished they'd done different is added a few more songs. The that first comes to mind is \\"Johnny\\", an unreleased SOAD song that is also one of my favorites. Other that the lack of \\"Johnny\\" it's nearly perfect. BUY IT!
B00005YJMX|5.0|This is Werner Herzog's 1979 superior remake of silent classic German Expressionist vampire film F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu: Symphony of Horror. This film is all that the 1922 silent version was, and more. It begins showing Dr. Renfield giving Jonathan the order to travel to the \\"haunted\\" land beyond the Forrest, Translvania, to give Count Dracula the papers for his new home. Lucy, Jonathan's wife begs him not to go, but he does not listen. Upon arriving to Dracula's castle, Dracula sees Lucy's picture and immediately signs the papers, and travels by ship to her town. Jonathan quickly rides back, but slowly gets sicker and sicker, until he cannot even remember how he met Lucy. Dracula's arrival brings the plague, and Lucy must make the ultimate sacrifice to destroy this hideous monster deprived of love. <br />The film is beautifully shot, and acted, with Werner Herzog behind the camera capturing, Klaus Kinkski's terrifying portrayal of the evil Dracula killing his victims. So many memorable scenes of darkness and horror are scattered throughout this film, with the silent beauty of nature watching on the side. The music in this film adds to the atmosphere of the good side of Jonthan/Lucy, and to the evil side of Dracula.  The original 1922 version of this film, was perfect in its display of gothic horror, and this film has all that the original offered, but adds more philosophy and insight, and a tragic ending that makes this version superior. Another classic from Herzog and Kinkski, I highly recommend this film to all fans of horror, vampires, and classic films. 5 stars.
B000002UB3|5.0|Some people may disagree with me but I Think Abbey Road is the Beatles best album. The LP has so many different styles. The songwriting is excellent. the musicianship as better than ever. We also get the entire package. The Teen pop they did in the early days, the experimentation , the ballads and of course the heavy songs. The Beatles Abbey road is one of those albums that you could just listen from start to finish without skipping a track. They also go back to their routes on this album and you could hear it on track 15. Among the best songs on the album. Abbey Road becomes the beatles masterpiece. Abbey Road is my all time favourite Beatles album and if you dont have it. Buy it now. You wont regret it.
0195067142|5.0|Although the cover and the title may not sound that eloquent or poetic, make no mistake, Sledge's elegy stands along perhaps 10 other wartime biographies written this century. He not only recounts war and the charnel houses of these two battles, but does it in a way that is both extremely moving in a prose style that is very reminiscent of the Robert Graves' WWI \\"Goodbye to all That\\" or WWII's Farley Mowat's \\"And No Birds Sang.\\"<br /><br />Sledge, who is not a professional writer like the above gentleman but writes, in my opinion, equally as well. As such Sledge has written the quintessential experience of the Marine in the Pacific War. it is one of the best, eloquent, haunting, and poetic reads I have every come across, and more than most war memoirs it is very, very scary.<br /><br />I think that one should be able to read through it quickly. I also liked it cause I ended up clawing through the jungle in the Horseshoe region on Peleliu and seeing nothing but gun positions, caves, and small human shaped holes in the coral landscape with Sake Bottles and used and unused cartridges in the holes.<br /><br />I took this book to Peleliu in 1998. The Jungle has mostly come back and there are few tourists on the Island, and none off the very few trails. The caves are littered with broken Japanese Army helmets, some rusted badly, others with the green in good condition.<br /><br />One can see nothing but jungle cleaved coral. After passing the usual \\"squid pots\\" (what the Japanese called the small coral caves and holes the dot the island), I was suddenly standing on an old oil drum, now rusted the same colour as the brown moss of the jungle. Then another drum.... rows of drums filled with coral. About at least 50 of them lined to a depth of three of four-deep covering the entrance to a coral cave. The front of the drums were torn and shredded by large calibre fire -- probably .50 calibre I surmise by the size of the holes. Despite its layers of armour I could not help but think that the Marines probably knocked the position out early, though it would have done them little good,as this position was covered by innumerable others.<br /><br />Sledge describes the caves and squid pots all up to the top of the ridge. Day after day the Marines in Sledges unit went into this horror. Okinawa was Peleliu magnified 10 times -- and they were dehumanised by the entire experience to a degree that those who have never, perhaps today few ever can, experience such a degree of fighting.<br /><br />It should be noted that the Marines and, later, the Army siezed the ridge after 4 months of fighting. 10,000 Japanese soldiers and about 2000 Americans died on this island 3 Miles Long and 1 mile wide. I came across their bones --- femurs, skull shards, and shredded bodies all over the island. All along I had Sledge's book to keep me dark company.<br /><br />And so I recommend you the book. In the same way that Robert Graves kept me company in my wet soujourns to Vimy Ridge and Ypres in Belgium, so too did Sledge keep me company in that hot hell in the South Pacific.bly knocked the position out early, though it would have done them little good,as this position was covered by innumerable others.

B00005QZ7U|1.0|I so disliked this movie that I don't even know where to begin with my criticism. Well, I guess I'll start with the very beginning of the movie because that is exactly where the torture of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" begins. The opening scene was so over-produced, horribly edited and simply nauseating that I almost didn't get past it. Was this supposed to be artistic??? Chaotic is more like it and it only turns the viewer off. <br />Next, the acting- Ewan McGregor was so-so, OK at best, in his portrayal of the struggling, tortured writer. And Nicole Kidman, well I haven't seen acting much worse! HOW could anyone have seen fit to give her an Oscar nomination for THAT??? I have just two words for Kidman: ExCESSIVE over-acting! <br />Now for the use of modern pop songs in this mess of a movie. I think it's a clear sign of the director's lack of original ideas. It wasn't clever, it was degrading to the original artists- The Beatles, Elton John, U2 and yes, even Madonna. <br />The one positive I have for this movie is that, when it's not causing motion sickness and seizures, it is visually appealing. The vibrant colors of the set and costumes is very theatrical and interesting but pretty colors can only go so far and they certainly can't make up for all the other attrocities of \\"Moulin Rouge.\\"
B00006LSM3|5.0|The final bow from this great musician is pure George all the way. Some here have compared it to his last studio recording, \\"Cloud Nine,\\" but in truth this collection of songs is closer in semblance to the first Traveling Wilburys record, and his mid to later seventies output. Quite frankly I prefer The self titled George Harrison record, or 33& 1/3, and even Somewhere in England over Cloud Nine, so I really enjoy Brainwashed. I think what helps most is that Jeff Lynne used a great deal of restraint in producing this record, avoiding the \\"ELO meets George Harrison\\" sound that dominated most of Cloud Nine. Every song is great, and others here have listed the best of those so I won't bother. However I do want to point out the title track is a bit of unintentional self irony, in that religion is one of the oldest forms of Brainwashing that there is. Then again, self-irony is a great last statement from the quiet Beatle with the wry smile and the weeping guitar.

B00005JL3A|5.0|I thought the movie Resident Evil was a very good and well acted movie. The movie wasn't ridiculous like Jason X, and it made alot of sense. Michelle Rodriguez is one of my favorite actresses. I thought she was perfect for this movie because, she was extremly tough. Milla was a very good person because of her unique fighting skills. This movie deserves five stars because the plot went right along with the whole movie and didn't change automaticlly without any sort of reason why. I especalliy love the fight scene with Milla and the mutant zombie dogs, along with the way Michelle shot the he** out of the first zombie that they encountered. One of my favorite quotes is \\"I shot her six times, how was she still standing?\\" the bit** isn't standing now.\\" The look the Michelle gave that guy was perfect. My only complaint was why did they have to kill Michelle? and why was she the only one who had to suffer with getting bit or scratched about 6 times! What I thought should have happened was her and Milla were going to be the only ones who made it out. I hope they make a sequel with they probally will, since there are so many video games. My opinion is this time the guy who got scratched my that huge mutant spawn looking creature returns, and Milla is the only one who can stop it, maybe the thing will only want Milla. Kind of like a Halloween Trilogy with mutant zombies. Maybe they can make the whole coming back of Rain [Michelle]thing work without it not making since. The best directors!    <br />                                 Chanel Henderson,<BR>                                 *** Movie Critic***

B00004STUL|3.0|The plot in this movie is absolutely nothing spectacular and is VERY basic. There are also plot holes all over the place. The constant arguing between Smith and Laurence also gets on my nerves and spoils the slight chemistry that they have. But Michael Bay's direction puts a glossy shine on an otherwise cruddy movie. But he made the movie in 1.85:1. Why?<br />The plot, for what it's worth, concerns a drug dealer (Tchecky Kayro in a virtually nameless role) who slays an idiot member of his gang. Beautiful Julie Mott (Tea Leoni) witnesses the slaying and is marked for death . She calls the cops but for a dumb reason will only talk to Mike Lowrey (Will Smith). Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is the only person there who can take the call and assumes the role of Mike in order to take Julie into `in-home' protective custody. Why he doesn't just reveal to her right away that he told a little white lie only to get her out of harms way...I dunno. Perhaps it is because it's the only plot element that the legion of writers could abuse to inject the slightest amount of comedy and drag out an 85-minute to 2 hours. It irritates beyond comprehension and the film should really have been dumped in the direct to video bucket instead of having a cinema release. But as long as the film masquerades as a proper Hollywood movie everything will be okay. And it's to Michael Bay's credit that he's managed to pull this off. Without him the movie would be long-forgotten.<br />A Hollywood movie it certainly is. It took 10 years for Bad Boys to be made and many changes to the script took place in that time. It was originally set in New York and was to star John Lovitz and Dana Carvey as the leads. It was shopped around Hollywood, chewed-up and spat out by many studios, until Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckhiemer picked it up and thought that turning it into a shiny and bright action adventure could redeem it. The budget wasn't too high and Bay did as much as he could considering the tiny amount of money he had (even spending part of his own salary) and did an impressive job too. The action scenes certainly make up for the lulls in the plot. Too bad there is not enough of them.<br />The van chase, shootout in the lobby and final battle are way cool and Mark Mancina's score is incredible. Too bad the score isn't available on CD but there is 5.1 isolated score on the DVD.<br />Everyone should see Bad Boys at least once as there will be something for everyone but do not expect a great or original plot. There isn't one, but the sequel is in production right now and Michael Bay is directing again. There are a truckload of features on this DVD. The widescreen picture is looking good and the 5.1 soundtrack and isolated score are way cool.money he had (even spending part of his own salary) and did an impressive job too.

B00005JA2B|5.0|This is the most praised, though not the most successful, Kansas album in their catalog and justly so, for the most part.  Overall, it is a very deft combination of the band's main influences: progressive rock, hard rock (pop) and their midwest musical roots.<br />&quot;Carry on Wayward Son&quot; is that rarest of songs--a huge hit that is also brilliant as a composition, its brilliance regularly being overshadowed and so overlooked because of its popularity.  &quot;Miracles out of Nowhere&quot; might be said to be describing itself, except that Kerry Livgren had already established on two previous albums that his musical genius (I do not think the word is an exaggeration) would no longer be cause for surprise.<br />&quot;Magnum Opus&quot;, as the name suggests, is the band's magnum opus, though not my favorite song by them.  Even so, that plummeting guitar line at the end of the first section (unhappily replaced by bass on &quot;Two for the Show&quot;), the natty staccato of keyboards on &quot;Industry on Parade&quot;, the guitar line to introduce the section afterward, the gorgeous marimba &amp; guitar chors of the mellow Beaver section, the bass of the final section...each part (and instrument) can be listened to in isolation without becoming boring.<br />For me, those are the high points of the album.  The rest is not as impressive.  I realize that to declare &quot;The Wall&quot; not amazing is almost blasphemy.  But, despite the obvious brilliance of the album in places (I don't think anything from Kansas compositionally surpasses the songs above, not even &quot;Song for America&quot;), I still sense a waning in creativity.  I can sense in the music a creative flagging that will result soon enough in &quot;Point of Know Return&quot;, which gave Kansas its widest recognition (and introduced me when I was 11 to the band).<br />The music on this album is solid.  The musicianship only deepens in nuance and performance.  It is a marvelously orchestrated album. It's just that it doesn't have the compositional inspiration throughout that earlier albums did, even as it is better than 90% of the music of its day.<br />If you are new to Kansas, this might be the best place to start (if not their phenomenal live album &quot;Two for the Show).just that it doesn't have the compositional inspiration throughout that earlier albums did, even as it is better than 90% of the music of its day.<br />If you are new to Kansas, this might be the best place to start (if not their phenomenal live album &quot;Two for the Show).
B00001ODHJ|4.0|First of all this movie is about a convenience store employee who happens to have a chain saw for a hand that travels back in time to battle an army of skeletons.  Seems like a humourous premise doesn't it? well army of darkness takes that strange premise and turns it into one of the most hilarious movies ever.  This movie stars Bruce Campbell who is a great in every one of his scenes.  His acting or I should say overacting style, fits with this movie very well, as it is supposed to be ridiculously cheesy.  In the opening scene &quot;Ash&quot; (campbell) leaps out of a pit so his chain saw can magically connect to his hand allowing him to deal with a undead fiend.  This is just the start of the outrageous storyline of this movie.  I will admit there were a few places the story dragged a little bit, (a few minutes could have been cut from the wind mill scene for instance.)  But overall if you are into cheesy &quot;horror&quot; movies you will probably like this one.  Also i am glad they didn't use the original ending (which is contained on this dvd) as it would have taken out the S mart finale, which in this reveiewers opinion is the most funny part of the movie.  Overall I enjoy this movie every time i watch it. If you have a twisted sense of humor and like things that aren't necessarily &quot;normal&quot; you to will probably enjoy this movie too.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I loved rage and was really pleased to hear of a collaboration even though i'd never really been a big fan of soundgarden.  When I first heard the demo tracks I was amazed, it was the best music i'd ever heard.  When the album came out I fell in love, it is, in my opinion, the best album by anyone ever.  it is perfect, there isn't a single bad song or even a mediocre song.  every one is brilliant.  buy this now.
B00006LFGD|5.0|While this is just another way for a huge record company to dig it's hands into the pockets of fans and give them what they already have, this album is nothing less than brilliant. Barbra Streisand is the only artist, that I know of, who has collaborated with this many huge music stars. Bryan Adams, Frank Sinatra, Celine Dion, Barry Gibb, Ray Charles and Judy Garland are just some of the extreme talents Barbra has worked with. My favorite duet on this album, and favorite song of all time, is &quot;Tell Him&quot; which Barbra recorded with Celine Dion. To me, Barbra and Celine have the voices of angels and when they're together it's the most extraordinary sound in the world. My other favorite duet is with my favorite male artist, Bryan Adams in the song &quot;I Finally Found Someone.&quot; Chances are, anybody can find a song on this album they will love. The Barry Manilow duet is all right. He sounds a bit bland and does not have what it takes to sing with Barbra. On the other hand, Josh Groban is amazing in the song &quot;All I Know Of Love.&quot; I'm trilled Barbra chose to sing with this amazing new talent. He is certainly worthy of recording with this legend. While Barbra's voice does sound aged in the new songs, she proves she still has a powerful enough voice to topple most all of the artists who are in their prime today.
B000002504|5.0|This record proves to be one of the most influencial progressive recordings from the seventies... and they do not over do the melletron! GG is my personal favorite progressive band from that era. Advent... and Boys in the Band are simply fantastic. This group of players mixed hard rock with acoustic wood instruments with a flare from the days of trubedours. It's a complex listen, but the best one to start with! Knots will astound you, once you let yourself go with it!

I like this record for my own cuz i am a diehard soad fan!<br />but what i like most is that darron produced it and he did a good job cuz the production is as kick a$$ as it is on toxicity<BR>and you hardcore fans will surely love it but have a wait for the next studio album!<br />F--k the system!
B000075BFK|5.0|2PAC'S best album since his death(or alive?)From the When we Ride On Our Enemies to Better Dayz<br />this album is going diamond
B000075BFK|4.0|First of all I should start by saying I own everything that 2pac has ever done. There will never be another m.c who was as prolific and as talented in my opinion so I expected this latest album to be top rate hip hop. The tracks which have been available on bootleg are excellent. Who Do U Believe in is one of pacs greatest works. Fair Xchange and Late Night are also unbelievable but the proudcers have tried to add new beats which are sub par and pac would have never had them over his lyrics if he were alive. By changing pacs beats its like somebody redrawing the smile on the mona lisa, its almost sacrilege. However if your a casual hip hop fan who enjoys R&amp;B then you will probably like this album, but for hardened pac fans it seems a bit of a disappointment. If Afeni Shakur wants to keep true to the legacy of Tupac she should release an unchanged version.
B000003S0P|5.0|I have a very difficult time trying to decide if \\"Red\\" or \\"In The Court...\\" are my favorite Crimson albums. \\"Red\\" is an extremely enjoyable album, and I would suggest it to anyone curious about King Crimson. Don't think that all of their albums sound like this though. Crimson sound different album to album, but still retain their off the wall sound. This group was one of the few that didn't fall victim to the 80s like Genesis and Yes. I saw them in concert a year ago and their new stuff is just as innovative and Minute Rice perfect as ever. It's a little insulting that a talented veteran band like King Crimson had to be the opening act for Tool. Tool can't match Crimson on their best day, but I guess it got alot of the younger generation exposure to King Crimson. It also shows that Tool has good taste in music.
B000002KDB|5.0|This official debut album from 1975 is an impressively varied and emotionally stirring collection of quality songs that includes compositions by country legends like Merle Haggard, a Lennon/McCartney composition and a powerful Harris co-composition: her aching, poetic tribute to [[ASIN:B000002LKH Gram Parsons]] titled Boulder to Birmingham. This reissue of Pieces of the Sky has been enhanced by the addition of two previously unreleased tracks.<br /><br />Of the up-tempo numbers, If I Could Only Win Your Love, Bottle Let Me Down and Queen of the Silver Dollar are the most outstanding. Among the slow songs I love Too Far Gone, Sleepless Nights and the exquisite & tender Before Believing. Even her version of [[ASIN:B000GG4XHE Dolly Parton's]] Coat of Many Colors, though firmly in the country tradition, sounds fresh. But perhaps the best track is Boulder to Birmingham with its striking imagery and melancholy tune. Emmylou's singing is spot-on, tasteful and sometimes understated, the arrangements are appealing while the virtuoso playing perfectly complements her spiritually resonant voice.<br /><br />This is the recording of a genius just setting out on her creative path, one that would lead to bluegrass masterpieces like [[ASIN:B0000691TF Roses in the Snow]] (1980), classic country albums like Blue Kentucky Girl (1980) & [[ASIN:B000002HE3 Cowgirl's Prayer]] (1993), famous collaborations like [[ASIN:B00000JZBQ Western Wall]] (1999) & Trio and traditional devotional music in a folk vein on [[ASIN:B000002LBS Angel Band]] (1987), as well as boundary shifting atmospheric rock classics such as Wrecking Ball, [[ASIN:B00004WZOJ Red Dirt Girl]] & Stumble Into Grace. Pieces of the Sky shows that the mastery of songcraft and the authentic soulful approach were there from the beginning.
0673388735|5.0|There is nothing that can be said about William Shakespeare that has not been said already; and very few of them are disputable. It feels good having all his works: those Comedies, Tragedies, Histories, and Poetries in one convenient volume. This 'Complete Works' is for sure a complete literary classic.

B00006JJ51|5.0|N.W.A.'s 1988 release Straight Outta Compton is the blueprint for the gangsta rap genre that exploded in the early 90's.  It was also radically different in tone than anything in hip-hop at the time.  Hip-Hop was mostly party records until Public Enemy came along and starting making a change by making political statements.  N.W.A. music was about life on the streets in South Central Los Angeles.  Their songs where tales of the gangsta lifestyle which included selling drugs, racist policemen, degrading woman and most of all violence.  The streets of Compton were and are a dangerous place and songs like the title track, \\"Gangsta Gangsta\\", \\"Dopeman\\" and \\"F-k Tha Police\\" are vivid descriptions of life in the hood.  The group was also notable for not just their violent lyrics, but for their immense skills.  Ice Cube wrote most of the album and it contains some of his best work, Dr. Dre laid down the beats which would lead him towards the being one of the top producers in hip hop.  Eazy-E set up his ruthless gangsta image that he would play out the rest of his life and MC Ren shows why he is one of the more underrated MC's in hip hop.  Straight Outta Compton is a true landmark album that many have tried to imitate, but no one has been able to duplicate.

B00006L3S3|5.0|1973's Mind Games found John Lennon returning to more familiar ground after 1972's overt political statement, Sometime In New York City.  Mind Games is full of highly melodic pop songs and crisp rockers, but Mr. Lennon still found some space to open up people's minds.  At the time, Mr. Lennon's new idea was to create a new Utopia or Nutopia as he called it.  The album featured the state's anthem which is listed as six seconds long, but is actually just dead silence.  Outside of that, the album is full of great stuff including the lush title track.  \\"One Day At A Time\\" is a beautiful song and \\"Tight A$\\" is a 50's style rocker.  \\"Bring On The Lucie (Freda Peeple)\\" combines a political message with one of the catchiest rhythm tracks on any of his solo works.  This newly remastered version of the album brings to life the fullness and richness of the tracks that previous cd's lacked.

B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John has released countless greatest hits packages, but if you want a retrospective from his first hit \\"Your Song\\" to his most recent, \\"This Train Don't Stop There No More\\", then Greatest Hits 1970-2002 is a must own.  This collection shows why Elton John and his lyricist Bernie Taupin are master musicians.  They created some of the most memorable and classic songs of all time.  They are equally adept at writing a beautiful ballad like \\"Daniel\\", a bouncy pop tune like \\"Crocodile Rock\\" or a hard rocker like \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\".  Every song on disk number one is a bonefide classic.  Some of the tracks on disk two, like the Lion King music, doesn't compare to his 70's heyday, but 80's &amp; 90's tracks like \\"I'm Still Standing\\", \\"Little Jeannie\\", \\"The One\\" and \\"Nikita\\" have worn well through the years.  Michael Jackson is the self proclaimed King of Pop, but the real crown belongs to Elton John.
B00003CXCD|5.0|To be perfectly clear, Gregory Peck is well cast in this, the best of all romantic comedies.  In 1953, he's about 37, and Hepburn is about 24--hardly a startling chronological chasm.  They're both terrific.  What I like best is the ending's sweet sorrow.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is a fine cd; unfortunately, it's not getting the credit it deserves simply because it is a huge departure from the previous work of the parties involved:  Rage Against The Machine and Chris Cornell.  The co-mingling, however, has produced a unique sound that is closer to true rock-and-roll than anything on the market today.  As with any first album, there will be kinks to work out, but I don't think you can go wrong with purchasing this, and I predict they will only get better.  Rock on!
B000063UR2|4.0|I love this movie, but I feel I love it more for its potential then what it actually achieves.  This movie manages to actually feel more like a fantasy book then a movie.  It adheres to the rules of modern, adult fantasy stories.  The Fairies / elves are dark and mysterious despite being on the side of light.  The scenery is magical.  Everything seems dreamlike.  The acting is marvelous. I would say Tom Cruise is the weakest actor of the lot, and that probably has more to do with the fact he has done some many things it is hard to suspend his acting history.  The weakness of this movie is the plot.  It is a simplistic good vs evil tale that is drawn out too long.  However, even this does allow the viewer some time to revel in the setting.  I do fear the meandering of the story will deter multiple viewings, but thanks to the magic of DVD you can just jump to the scene that you want.  I also like the fact that both the director's cut and the American release versions are including on the DVD with all the usual commentaries.  This is a dreamlike story, a lulling tale before bedtime, not an action pact adventure.  It is in the tradition of books like The Last Unicorn, or Patricia A. McKillip's stories.<br />I feel that the only fantasy movie that does a better job of telling it's story more like a modern fantasy (fairy tale subdivision) book than a kid's movie is Lord of the Rings.  And I believe that Lord of the Rings, Legend, and Labrynth (Jim Henson) are the three movies that lovers of the genre should check out.
B000070WJE|4.0|This probably his darkest ablum yet in terms of the style and themes of some of the songs.  Robbie sounds like he's trying a little too hard to be taken seriously in the U.S.  In his first 6 songs, he appears to be well on his way.  The album sadly drops off in performance with a group of fillers that make me wonder if the album would've been better served excluding those tracks.  Robbie is a clever songwriter, but this album shows the downfalls of when he doesn't keep his cheeky style in check.  I can stand the occasional profanity, but the overuse of the F word, ruining a song by saying, \\"F--- you all!\\" at the end is in my opinion lazy songwriting.  While it's important for Robbie to be himself in his songs, there's a difference between blunt and profoud songwriting and just coming off as some whining [person] who sounds pressed for creative lyrics.  Overall though, it's a clever album and one that will go down well with Robbie fans everywhere.
B00006CXXU|5.0|For all you Christina fans, and those who aren't, this is a must buy. Almost every song on this album is awesome. I especially enjoy Fighter (probably because I can relate to it). It has such a good beat and really good energy. Another fav is Infatuation. The latin tone is perfect to dance to, makes you wish you were on an exotic island somewhere. This album just further proves that she can sing and deserves the credit for it. Her new image doesn't leave much to the imagination but honestly, she pulls it off!
B00006RU5B|4.0|Let's be honest - rock music by 2002 has degenerated into a sad, putrescent, vomitous hodgepodge of rehashed nu-metal riffs and self-pitying crybaby lyrics, frantically pimped out to us by the greedy suits in the record industry. I think we all secretly jumped for joy when we heard that the boys from Rage were getting together with Chris Cornell to finally put out something good for a change. <br />Well, the good news is they don't disappoint. Audioslave rocks. <br />That said, something is lacking here: &quot;A lack of cohesiveness&quot; is the best term I can think of to describe it. Rage and Cornell rock together, but they don't seem to know what the hell they're about. The music sounds great, but it doesn't make any sense. If this is a hard rock album, Cornell's lyrics are too soft and abstract. If it's progressive rock, Morello &amp; co. aren't right for the job. (They're too damn funky.) Listening to the album, one can't help but get the impression that Morello, Wilk, and Commerford are having to restrain themselves, and that even then Cornell is still struggling to keep up. Even the artwork for the CD insert seems rather puzzling and generic, which leads me to believe that Audioslave is indeed &quot;Rage Against the Machine with Chris Cornell&quot;, and not &quot;Audioslave&quot;, a cohesive and autonomous band.  <br />But maybe it's not fair to try to categorize good music like this. My question, then, is whether Audioslave will survive as a BAND - that is, one that goes on tour and puts out subsequent albums - or whether it will turn out to be just a side project that came out rather well.
0002558122|5.0|Angela's Ashes, a memoir written by Frank McCourt, is a stirring tale about a young boy's venture into manhood. &quot;Michael... is only five, and won't understand anything until he is eleven like me.&quot; (McCourt, 225) The main character, Frank, takes on the role as man of the house since his dad has left to join the army and he is the eldest of kin. Even though he is only eleven, he considers himself a man like his father. &quot;The doctor says [to me], Run along, be a man...&quot; (McCourt, 227) In this quote, Frank has just seen a doctor because he has an eye infection, and the doctor drips an unknown, burning-sensation liquid into his eyes. He is proud that people who do not even know him, consider him worthy to be a man. I give this book five stars because it is so truthful, you are able to relate to it, and it is not sugar- coated.
0066214122|4.0|Michael Crichton takes us back to the complex world of computer technology in his latest book, a non-stop page-turner about a cloud of nanoparticles -- manmade micromachines -- that have escaped (or were they released?) from a laboratory in the Nevada desert and proceed to raise all kinds of mayhem.  These critters may be micron-sized, but they cause some macro-sized trouble.  They operate in a swarm.  They're smart.  They learn from experience.  They've been programmed to be self-sustaining and self-reproducing.  And they've developed a killer instinct and an insane hunger to feed off any kind of life.  Most sinister of all, they're learning how to replicate -- they can assume the shape and form of humans.  And now their creators have become their prey.<br />Crichton is at his best when he writes about abstruse scientific and technical concepts in such a way that even the most hopeless techno-nitwit (like this reviewer) can understand what he's talking about.  I've always thought Crichton missed his real calling; he would have made an absolutely superb teacher.  He loves science and technology, he's read extensively (there are 44 references to genetics, nanotechnology and distributed intelligence for the reader to follow up at the end of the book), and he knows how to explain it in such a way that it seems endlessly fascinating and awe-inspiring.  He's also a scientist with a social conscience, who emphasizes in \\"Prey\\" as he did in \\"Jurassic Park\\", that just because something can be done doesn't mean it should be.  He's clearly disgusted with those gung-ho scientists and techies who are so involved with their work that they have lost sight of how the results will impact on the world outside the laboratory, either for good or bad.<br />\\"Prey\\" suffers from Crichton's usual one-dimensional characters, although his hero, Jack Forman, is a little better developed than his earlier protagonists; we see him as a concerned father (he's a calamity of the Silicon Valley implosion raising three children while his wife directs the lab that created this menace) as well as a very worried computer expert who realizes that something lethally wicked this way comes; but with Crichton the characters are never the main draw; he may be weak on characterization but he is one terrific storyteller, and \\"Prey\\", as much as \\"Jurassic Park\\", will keep you mesmerized from the first page to the last.
B000075BFK|5.0|At first, I wasn't expecting much when I first bought Better Dayz from 2Pac.  At most, I was expecting a gloomy album, where 2Pac's death was very evident.  Instead, Better Dayz is full of fresh beats, smart rhymes, and leaves the listener with the feeling that 2Pac is still alive.  After hearing this, many people will doubt whether 2Pac is truly dead.  This CD isn't quite at the level of All Eyez On Me, but it's very close.  Definately, a must-have.

B00006M183|5.0|I'm not going to babble on about how great this album is as you really have to hear it to appreciate it, after the excellent but often shunned Binuaral this will once again put Pearl Jam back into the spot light, if you haven't already got your hands on this GET THEM ON IT =p
B00006F7XJ|5.0|Another longtime Camel fan checks in:  this cd is brilliant.  I hesitate to call it their best because there have been so many highlights over the years, but \\"A Nod...\\" is truly magical, from the opening birds chirping and trains rumbling in to the last moment of the train leaving.  It is difficult to pick out my favorite cuts because each one has such depth, emotional charge and beautiful changes that the whole cd must be listened to in order to appreciate what Mr. Lattimer and Co. have created. Others have compared certain songs to past work however I perfer to let each creation play out. Obviously inspired by the loss of the great Pete Bardens, Lattimer takes the Camel trademark so much further than before.  His guitar and flute playing are inspired. The other musicians also shine and add great touches to the compositions.  This is a great cd.  Easily in the top 5 of the year.  Do not hesitate for a second in picking it up, the rewards are plentiful.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Its about time this cd came out to give rock n' roll the much needed kick in the [bottom] it needed. Cornell and Rage were a match made in heaven when they decided to get together and make this album! From the hit single \\"Cochise\\" to \\"The Last Remaning Night\\" this cd just kicks [bottom]. Ex-Rage members Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk play their muisc as only they can from hard rockin' beats to [stuff] that just makes you want to bang your head. Cornell on the other hand delivers the vocals that make you want to stand up and shout! my suggestion is that you get up off your [bottom,] go to the store and get Audioslave you wont regret it!
0679424741|5.0|This is a brilliant novel set in a Georgia milltown during the Great Depression.<br />Four people,struggling with their own identities, confide in a deaf mute. Dr. Copeland is a black physician suffering from TB who is estranged from his own family by his passionate devotion to protecting the rights of his race; Jake Blount, an alcoholic and border-line psychotic, who is tormented by his radical ideas of the rights of the working class, Biff Brannon a restaurant owner who is trying to come to terms with his own feelings following the death of his wife; and Mick Kelly, a sensitive teenage girl and daughter of the family who own the boarding house where the mute lives, .<br />The four feel a special kinship to the mute, Mr. Singer, because of the sensitivity that each one must sense in him. Singer listens to their stories and asks them questions yet he gives little advice. Singer himself is a depressed by the decline, both physically and mentally, and institutionalization of his constant companion, another deaf mute, whose fate ultimately has a profound affect on Singer and his four confidants.  <br />The book deals subtly with several different social issues-racial strife in the South, a teenage girl coming to terms with her emerging sexuality, labor unrest, and the effect of the Great Depression on the middle class.
B000002R4R|4.0|This is one of the best Soft Machine albums and quite underrated by the critics as well.Every person fond of complex and &quot;brainstorming&quot; music, like the modern experimental works from the French Zeuhl music and the experimental symphonic ones as well(such as Magma, Dun and Minimum Vital) is involved in some stuff which is far from this Soft Machine work, but not very different. &quot;Six&quot; is the roundabout for S.M., then you can choose to continue with their music or change in order to hold the most difficult style of Zeuhl music...<br />However this work is highly recommended and not only as an historical document!!
B0000542D2|5.0|This movie is the beginning of the Beatles' legend.<BR>And this movie is beginning of the British Invension.<BR>If you are interested in music, you must watch this movie.<BR>You will find new music vision I guess.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album deserves 5 stars because of its versatility and offering of solid good music. We all know Christina can sing, and she reinforces this a number of times on this compilation with strong, emotional ballads. Memorable tracks include the catchy and symbolic &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot; and latin-infused &quot;Infatuation.&quot; A mature and admirable second CD from a gutsy and innovative artist.

6304698623|3.0|Nice scenery, but not for purists.  The movie is visually stunning, but the plot is only barely related to the book by Frances Hodgson Burnett.  Needs a better actress as Sara.
B00007E8V4|3.0|As you might already know this album is nothing but outtakes of there &quot;Toxicity&quot; album but doesn't necessarily mean it isnt' good.  They should've added these songs to the second album to make a double-disc and just pay and extra five bucks for it and it would've been worth it but nonetheless this album is a little faster and has decent tracks on them.  But if your a system fan than i would recommend it.
B00006LFGD|3.0|First thing, let me say that I love Barbra Streisand. No other female singer on the planet today can touch her (Celine, Eder, Mariah, Whitney, Christina). The thing that has always set Streisand apart from the rest of the crop was all the nuances her voice could convey. It seems that todays singers only know two or three notes...loud, louder and even louder. Barbra puts emotion into everything she sings. Something these other girls need lessons in.<br />Most of these duets are first rate and classic material, including You Don't Bring Me Flowers, No more Tears and What Kind of Fool. The highlight of the collection is the duet with Barbra herself on One Less Bell To Answer/A House Is Not A Home. Amazing and spine tingeling. She was at the top of her game when she recorded that and it sounds amazing today as when I first heard it back in 1971. <br />I was excited about the prospects of a duet with Barry Manilow. The song is ok. They both sound great and deserve better material.  Streisand sounds amazing on her duet with Josh Groban. She sounds like she did 20 years ago (none of the vibrato, vocal thinness and reediness that has filled her recent recordings). But the song is mediocre. Just think if they had been given something great to sing how exciting the duet could have been.<br />Now with saying that, I'm tired of Columbia Records and Barbra taking advantage of Barbra's many (I' gotta have everything, obsessive) fans. The one's (like most Barbra fans) that will buy anything for one or two extra songs because they want to hear something new from this amazing singer.<br />5 of these songs were just released on her Essential set several monthys ago, witch also featured 2 unreleased bonus cuts. 4 songs is almost a half album. Why not wait and give us a whole new CD?  Or how about a CD with all of her 45's(like I Am Woman that was put on the recently released UK CD of People - but not the US), alternate versions, and other unreleased material (like &quot;Just Because&quot; an outtake from A Love Like Ours).<br />That is why I gave the CD collection three stars (not because of her performances on the CD's tracks). <br />This gimmick of giving the fans a crumb or two called a &quot;bonus, unreleased track&quot; has got to stop. But I imagine it won't as long as people keep buying.

B00003CXI1|5.0|I went in to see this film after my friend persuaded me to come along, and came out with a new favorite movie. I just started reading book 1 this month, because I wanted to know what was going on in the movies, but they were really magnificent and I must say, reading the books helps you understand the movie. Nothing is explained in the much anticipated second movie, so you'll need some background knowledge. The second movie, which I saw on the Opening Night, was SO much fun that I even saw it again! The actors and filmmakers had more experience, and therefore resulted in a better movie than the first, in my opinion. Seeing the movie on opening night was a plus, because all the fans attended, clapping, cheering, gasping, and providing enthusiatic responses to the movie. If you didn't like the movie, then it was probably a dull crowd that influenced you. I think you should see it ASAP, because when I saw it the second time (a week later), there were parents and toddlers who really didn't try to enjoy the movie. Anyway, great movie; I was amazed at the special effects and how well the characters were portrayed in the movie. If you didn't like either movie, then you're just being rash, because about 20 songs each were composed by the famous John Williams, and 16,000 kids auditioned for Harry Potter. Not to mention that the 9 minutes of Quidditch took 3 months to plan and 6 months to film!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Aside from the occasional (not all) &quot;dumb&quot; Tom Morello guitar solos, this album absolutely ROCKS!! It's heavy as hell, melodic and of course, Chris' vocals are insane. It's one of those records that makes it clear that some bands just get it and some don't. Audioslave definitely get it. And disregard any Led Zeppelin references. Zeppelin never sounded anything like this. If you don't own this record yet, and you like aggressive but melodic music, BUY IT NOW!

0800179501|3.0|Five star movie, 1 start DVD = 3 stars total.<br />This is one of my top 5 favorite films. However, I'm not about to buy the DVD when it only has the Fullscreen version and no commentary. Its really sad that such a classic has gone so unappreciated. Parts 2 and 3 are widescreen, wake up people!<br />Oh and by the way, if you are one of those people who think that widescreen means that they &quot;cut off the top and bottom&quot; of the film to make it look like you're in the movies, please educate yourself. Its fullscreen versions of films that cut parts of the picture out.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I originally watched this movie because of a Holocaust project and, after seeing the movie only once, I immediately purchased the DVD. The movie was wonderful. Rather than focusing entirely on the horror of the Holocaust, as most movies would do, this movie allows you to form emotional attachments with the characters. I recommend this movie for anyone who wants to see one of the most well-written movies in a very long time.
B000075BFK|3.0|I'm a BIG Tupac fan! I may be one of his biggest fans. But honestly I'm not really feeling this Better Dayz album. The lyrics and everything is nice,but it doesn't go with some of the beats. It sounds like most of the beats are from a R&amp;B/Techno CD. R.I.P. Tupac,and hopefully next album we can get something like your old material(beat wise).
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina is not the sweet, innocent, and charming girl that we were introduced to with her first CD offering.  Instead, she is a woman with a painful past.  Stripped takes us through some of the pain and joy of her life.  Ultimatley, Stripped shows us the growth of Christina from her days as a \\"Genie in a bottle\\" to today's \\"Dirrty\\" girl.
B00003CXI1|2.0|The theme of this movie re-enforces a magic/witchcraft theme.  It is not for a Christian to really show there children since it is contrary to a Christian belief.  It has alot of good special effects, but I found my young nieces would be too impressionable with this.  Caution.
B00006F7S4|1.0|I can't play this CD by itself. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Beck fan. But, this one is completely depressing.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne has been called \\"the missing link between Britney Spears and Blink-182\\".  Actually, it would be more accurate to say that \\"Let Go\\" is more Sarah McLachlan meets Alanis Morissette, without McLachlan's sometimes overbearing moodiness or Morissette's off-key nasal whining.  For all Lavigne was only 17 when this album was recorded, \\"Let Go\\" shows a surprising degree of maturity, from the rage-filled \\"Losing Grip\\" to the plaintive \\"I'm With You\\" to the joyous \\"Things I'll Never Say\\".  The only track that doesn't really seem to fit is the abominably spelled \\"Sk8er Boi\\" (what is with this mauling of the language anyway?), which is a garden-variety \\"the-other-girl-turned-him-down-because-he-was-a-punk-and-now-he's-famous-and-I've-got-him-ha-ha-ha\\" song and is the only song on this album that actually sounds like it was written and sung by a 16-year-old.  But \\"Sk8er Boi\\" notwithstanding, the album is very enjoyable and a refreshing change from the cutesy/[dirty] crop of current teen-girl pop princesses.  \\"Let Go\\" is full of promise, and it will be interesting to see what Lavigne does for a sophomore effort.
0393317552|5.0|I do not have a degree in history but have always been interested in discovering the past.  Many \\"scholarly\\" books speak at a level that makes reading them more a chore than pleasure.  Guns, Germs, and Steel sets a standard for intelligent, well composed historical prose that hits all the high points.  I never felt left behind by the author and was intrigued by the expanding case for environment as the driving cause of conquest and the make up of our modern world.<br />A joy to read, it is enlightening and well laid out.  The only caveat would be Diamond's tendency to restate his case and prove already acceptable theories.  The entire work is logical and I can't find an argument to dispute his conclusions.
B00007E8V4|3.0|Well, quite a disappointment. It is a good Cd, but nothing compared to Toxicity. They went to hard this time. I just bought it, but, frankly, I'm wishing I bought the Squarepusher album instead. If you are a big fan of System of a Down, then its worth it. But, if you are just a casual listener, don't bother.<BR>The only good track in my opinion is the 16th, Streamline. If you want that, then just buy the Scorpion King Soundtrack, which is excellent.
0440203856|4.0|I must say that this is an intriguing book to read, thoroughly enjoyable, and very earnest in the feelings it conveys. However, as a Romanov afficionado I fundamentally oppose putting words into the mouths of the Tsar's family. Also, some glaring mistakes were made in their descriptions:<br />First, Joy was NOT Maria's (Mashka's) dog, nor was it a female! HE was a liver spaniel and belonged to Tsarevich Aleksei, Marie's younger brother. The reason I know he couldn't be a girl is, first, accounts of those who knew him and the family, and, second, the fact that &quot;JOY&quot; in Russian sounds positively like a male name.<br />Marie herself had a pet mouse, her sisters Anastasia had a Cavalier King Charles spaniel named Jemmy (though some say he originally belonged to Tatiana), Tatiana had a French bulldog named Ortino (who was a girl), and Olga had a cat named Vaska.<br />Also, somehow it seems improbable that a COUNTESS, which is rather low a title in Russia (Grand Duke and Prince come above it!) could be a cousin to the Tsar. <br />No blood was shed in the days of the Revolution, nor in the Bolshevik coup d'etat; the book says that &quot;hundreds of people were dead by the end of the day.&quot; <br />Finally, the book depicts the Revolution as happening in a snap, and immediately Bolshevik. That is very, very wrong indeed. All of 1917 and part of 1916 endured strikes and random violence in Petrograd. Plus, after the Revolution came a summer of non-Bolshevik rule, though they were, of course, very powerful already...<br />However, the book was very good outside of that. Though again, another comment, most White emigres tended to keep up the Russian language and culture in their children, while Zoya doesn't do this... She could, of course, be called an exception, but somehow the fact that her children don't speak Russian sounds weird.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave is a perfect mixture of heavy rock &amp; funk that you can get into no matter what mood you're in. This album has quickly become a favorite of mine, not going a day without listening to it. I would highly recommend this album, especially if you were a fan of either of the member's former bands. You will not be dissapointed!
B00006LSM3|4.0|This is a wonderful album. The melodies and undercurrents stay with you. It is mostly upbeat. The guitar work is George at his best. It closely resembles Cloud 9. It is a must for any fan of this beautiful man. We miss youGeorge. Thanks for this.
B00006JDVV|3.0|Okay the film has a wonderful idea. So dragons are real, terminated the dinosaurs and now they're alive and kicking. So why does this turn out to be a kind of Mad Max with only a few survivors running for their lives? Wouldn't it be a lot more exciting to see the fight of civilization against a new original of threat? Wouldn't it be great to see dogfights of copters vs. dragons? This turns the poster into the biggest bluff of the movie. It could use a kind of Independence Day formula and be original with it but sadly it falls into the easy formula of the clich and the result is almost two hours of fire and more fire, action sequence after action sequence. Thus, I award it a 5, it wasn't at all disappointing - Christian Bale gives this much-needed class, and his head-to-head with a souped-up McConaughey's Van Zan provides more tension than the occasional dragon threat. But it doesn't really make the viewer feel totally satisfied. And please: no sequels!
B00006RU5B|5.0|After some periods of time where i wasn't sure that i would ever hear chris cornell sound the same way as he did in soundgarden he comes back with the members from rage against the machine in this hard hitting debut album.  The guitar is just spectacular and the vocals with the lyrics are just incredible and they mesh it together and just kick you with it.  It is easily one of the best albums out this year and I can't wait for another album from this super rock group.  Tom Morello does some of his best works on this CD and Chris cornell hasn't sounded this good since Soundgarden.  I advise any fans of rage against the machine and soundgarden to purchase this CD because it is everything I wanted it to be and more.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars fans will want this DVD to keep the story handy, but DVD afficionados, action/adventure fans and sci-fi fans will find a lot of value here as well. There are 2 DVDs, the first one is the movie proper which has an option for a separate audio track of commentary from George Lucas and others; this is a great insight into the challenges and ideas that are behind-the-scenese. Disc 2 is a vast cornucopia of extras: documentaries, deleted scenes, and featurettes. The amount of extras is impressive and the details you will learn about in terms of making the movie, the rules that were broken and techniques defined by Lucasfilm, rounds out the purchase so well that almost all other DVD releases at this time pale in comparision.<br /><br />I have now come to expect much more from other releases and have been pleased only with a few others, such as Episode II's DVD and Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings DVD. I hope that other movies will receive the detailed treatment that this one does!
B00005K3OT|4.0|Coming from Lasse Hallstrom, the director of `Cider House Rules', this film is sweet as it's name. It is a simple story set in a French village in the late 1950s. Vianne ( Juliette Binoche ) who migrates from village to village comes here alongwith her daughter Anouk ( Victoriwe Thivisol ) on a cold windy day. She rents a shop from Amande ( Judi Dench ) to open a delightful Chocolaterie. Her little shop introduces the villagers to the pleasures of delectable chocolate and spiced hot cocoa which Vianne prepares and serves personally. She befriends many with her knack of guessing each one's favourite flavour. Little does she know that this town is controlled by the Mayor ( Alfred Molina ) who is an orthodox man and despises all such worldly pleasures. He uses the church sermons to preach the village folk to stay away from such temptations he considers sins and makes no pretence of his dislike towards Vianne. The movie is about how Vianne takes up this challenge fighting her own insecurities and seduces the village with her fine art of making sinfully tempting chocolates. There are several subplots in the film -  one of a battered wife Josephine (Lena Olin ) who stands up for herself , Amande's bitter relation with her daughter and her longing to be with her grandson, the Mayor's own inauthenticity and the bad boy gypsy Roux ( Johnny Depp ) who  plays the love interest of Vianne.<br />The movie is warm and sensitive. There is a lot of lighthearted humour brought out in various situations. The scenes that show the making of delicious and eye-catching chocolates are delightful. All chocolate lovers will be lip smacking at those very moments. But, movie's strength is in exposing the hypocrisy of those who claim to be close to God but have chosen the path of denial even to such simple a pleasure as enjoying a chocolate. It teaches us to drop all the significance we give to our lives instead of just relishing our moments.<br />Vianne's character as the charming chocolatieris played to perfection by Juliette Binoche. While, Albert Molina as the repressive Mayor is excellent. Johnny Depp gives the romantic angle to the film. Judi Dench as the old indulgent Amande is graceful.<br />See this one, it will bring a sweet smile to your face.
B00006M183|4.0|I don't know about any other PJ fans but I am sick and tired of people comparing new PJ releases to 'Ten'.    To me 'Ten' was an anomaly in which will never be repeated again, somehow the band captured lightning in a bottle and created a musical masterpiece which struck a lot of people's musical chords at that moment in time.  This band has been around for over 10 years and the sound of albums today are going to be completely different then a decade ago because they have matured musically and adapted over the years.   To ask the band to recreate that magic is simply uncalled for and fans should start judging new albums on what they are and not what they aren't (i.e. 'Ten').   <br />On to Riot Act.  This is a good album, check that.....a very good album.  There are no rock anthems ('Rear View Mirror, 'Evolution',etc.) on this album like in earlier years, &quot;I Am Mine&quot; would be the closest.  &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; deals with pain involved in love, including the 9 fans that died at a PJ show at the Roskilde rock festival.<br />&quot;It's an art to live with pain/ mix the light into gray/ lost nine friends we'll never know/ two years ago today.&quot; <br />&quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; has an &quot;Off He Goes&quot; feel to it but it sounds a lot like Neil Young (which is a compliment).<br />&quot;You Are&quot; is one that on first listen doesn't sound like PJ at all but give Matt Cameron credit for creating a great sound that you would think you would never hear on a PJ album.  This could even be a dance hit, I'm dead serious.<br />&quot;Green Disease&quot; is basically about corporate mismanagement and in fact is quite a catchy tune.   <br />I like how Vedder worked two lines from previous PJ songs into two new ones.   On &quot;Save You&quot; he sings &quot;Don't go on me now&quot; which is right from &quot;Go&quot; on the &quot;Vs&quot; album.   And in &quot;1/2 Full&quot; he croons &quot;There ain't gonna be any middle any more, it's been said before&quot; with the first line coming from &quot;Porch&quot; off of &quot;Ten&quot;.<br />In reading other reviews I heard criticism that the album lacks direction and focus.   One thing to keep in mind is that many of the other songs were written by band members other than Vedder, probably more so on this album than on previous ones.   To have so much input from so many people and have this album to turn out the way it did, it's a testament to the amount of talent these guy's really have.  <br />Buy this album, you wont' regret it.
B000075BFK|5.0|Still Ballin, being the first track of this double cd creation is an appropriate title.  Even in death tupacs lyrics reman strong and persistant in pertaining to life in 2002.  This cd is a deep look into the now 6 year dead rap veteran as a spirit who still remains with us.  I feel Tupac will always be the greatest, in the year 2023 he will still be seen as a Hip-Hop mega star, translating lyrics into forms of his own poetry, show an endless amount of viriety, creativity and emmotion.  I compare Tupac to Bob Marley or Jimmy Hendrix, or a Marven Gay.  He made music for the soul, he told it as it was, he was a straight shooter, and died for his beliefs.....Hero's like Notorious B.I.G who have died for hip-hop will always be remember, but legends like Tupac will never die...2pacs spirit shall always live on, within his music, his poetry, his films, and being. <BR>It sadens me that \\"Better Dayz\\" is his last CD...for I always look forward to hearing new unreleased 2pac songs.  However I know that he is looking down on these hard times from heaven and wispering through the wind, \\"keep ur head up\\".  I will mourn 2pac forever, \\"give me a paper and pen, so i can write about my life of sin, a couple bottles of Gin, in case i don't get in, tell all my peoples I'm a riddah, nobody cries when we die, we outlawz just let us ride, until i get free, i'll live my life in the fast lane got police chasin me....\\"-2pac (R.I.P)
B00006AW2G|4.0|This is a great album, but I was a little disappointed to discover that, despite it being advertised by ABKCO as being different than the original release, it is not. ABCKO claims on their website that this rereleas is \\"the way the Stones originally intended it back in 1970,\\" that is cut with no gaps between songs and each song fading into the next. Well, obviously this idea was abandoned somewhere along the way, because it sounds exactly the same as my old vinyl copy, gaps and all! That said, it does sound really great, at least as good as the original vinyl, but I have to question ABKO's overall motives in all these Stones rereleases. None have bonus tracks (except More Hot Rocks) and there are separate UK/US editions when they could have easily combined those onto one CD. With a running time of under half an hour for some of the earlier LPs,... why no bonus tracks at all? There are tons of unreleased and great Stones outtakes, alternate versions, etc. out there.  and you'd think some of those could've been used!  Also, since they released the UK versions of all the LPs, why is there no \\"Rolling Stones\\" and \\"No.2,\\" both of which had different tracks (and versions!) than their US counterparts, \\"Now\\" and \\"England's Newest Hitmakers?\\"  I think that the ABKCO reissues do sound really great, much better than the horrible \\"remasters\\" released in the '80s, but they could've done better. Another point of contention for me is the somewhat erratic mono-stereo grab bag that the LPs have become. In the case of, say \\"12x5,\\" it's cool to finally hear true stereo mixes of songs, but why are there mono versions mixed in when there are stereo versions available and those songs (and subsequently bootlegged years ago!)? Not to mention the somewhat jarring experience that one has when listening on headphones and bouncing between mono and stereo songs.
B00006IU73|5.0|I bought this album, having not heard even a second of Porcupine Tree's music.  The only things I had to go on were Steven Wilson's excellent guest vocals on the Opeth song \\"Bleak\\", and my friend Lord Chimp's rave review.  But, I was sure it would be worth the risk, and it was.<br />Porcupine Tree's music is a bit difficult to describe.  They combine the British rock stylings of Radiohead with more progressive elements, and even a bit of metal.  Now, don't be discouraged if you're not really into Radiohead.  While I have a great deal of respect for what they do, I've never really been a huge fan of their work, but I still really enjoy this band.  It is generally more diverse, and more interesting than that of Radiohead, and Steven's vocals (IMO) have a much better melodic quality than that of Thom Yorke.<br />Anyway, we have here an interesting concept album.  It is the story of the life of a serial killer, and thus you might expect it to be rather dark and gloomy throughout, but they manage to work in lighter, and even catchy moments, and they fit in quite nicely.  There are the darker, heavier tracks, like \\"Blackest Eyes\\" and \\"Strip the Soul\\", but these are balanced out by lighter, fluffier tracks, like \\"Trains\\", the vaguely Beatle-esque \\"Heart Attack in a Layby\\", and the peaceful album closer, \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth\\".  The music isn't insanely complex, but the musicians all do exactly what is necessary.  The songs change tempo frequently, and the layered instrumentation makes for a nice atmosphere.  Steven's soft, yet menacing vocals are a perfect match for a story such as this. Everything fits together, making for a solid album all the way through.<br />Yep, I like this.  Definitely one of the best of the year.  Highly recommended to fans of progressive rock.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This CD is an instant classic, combining the low-end crunch of Rage against the machine with the unmistakeable melody of Soundgarden.  I admit that while I was skeptical at first, the combination of Morello's guitar pyrotechnics with Cornell's vocal prowess, all the while nailed firmly to the floor by Wilk and Commerford has completely won me over. &quot;Show me how to live,&quot; &quot;Like a stone&quot; and &quot;The last remaining light&quot; showcase Cornell's amazing lyrical and vocal range, while &quot;Cochise,&quot; &quot;Shadow on the sun&quot; and &quot;Bring em back alive&quot; show off the tightness of Morello, Wilk and Commerford.  This CD heralds the beginnings of a great fusion; we can only hope that they survive the pressure and become a diamond
1558807381|5.0|Prancing Unicorns, fluttering Fairies, an evil, horned, hooved Lord Of Darkness. Tom Cruise in a short suit showing off his gorgeous legs. This movie has everything. Including an absolutely, WONDERFUL song at the end. Not only do you need to buy this movie, get the soundtrack as well. You'll love this movie. And if you have kids, they'll love it too.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Yet another winner from the System.  A collection of previously unreleased tracks or tracks they cut for movie soundtracks, etc., the sheer musicality and originality of System of a Down shines in every song on this cd.  They seem to break some new ground and invent some new sound, especially in songs like Ego Brain, [and] Thetawaves...  Boom! is a song that reminds you that SoaD's music has often had a political message about societal wrongs or the individual malaises of greed/immorality/etc.  System of a Down is known for being able to pack a lot of content into a very short song, and that brevity is evident here, as none of the songs is much more than 4 minutes long (Mr. Jack is the longest at about 4:11);  however, this has never been a necessarily bad thing.  Overall, Steal This Album is snappy, fresh, and technical without being overly commercial.  A good follow-up to Toxicity, and a cd that no good music collection should be without.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Need a dollup of fantasy coupled with excellent special effects? Then this little movie is just right.  Rob Bowman has put together a strong cast, adroitly built a convincing set and atmosphere that successfully gives us a credible (though dismal) look into the future when the golbe has been destroyed by, no, not nuclear weaponry, but the halitosis of a breed of heretofore hibernating dragons.  Coming out of this state of terrorist bondage, living beneath the ground to survive the demonic holocaust of flying dragons, is the journey we're on, led ably by a very buff Matthew McConaughey and and even buffer Christian Bale.  The only actor who flies like the dragons (albeit in a helicopter sans fiery breath) is the beautiful Isabella Scorupco. Abetting the trials of Bale is a very fine actor by the name of Gerard Butler.  The supporting cast, while not given much to say, are all convincing, especially the Male Dominant Dragon who is created with such sophisticated animation graphics that he is truly threatening.  Peeks at London pre and post dragon-attack are beautifully rendered.  Not a whole lot of plot here, but hey, what fairy tales concentrate on plot?  You've got to like these gladiators - they, with the director's help - give us a sizzingly good time.  Relax your philosophical brain parts and just go for the ride.
B00006RU5B|5.0|With the coming of this new album (long waited and waited and waited for) comes a sound that is unbelievable.  As a fan of Cornell and his work with Soundgarden, T.O.T.D., and his solo album, this album is at the top of my list.  It's incredible.  Cornell was able to put together awesome lyrics with the beats of former Rage members.  The sound is phenominal.  As skeptical as I had been that a combonation of these two bands are, me just not being a Rage fan (no offense to them, they're great, just not my style), I have to admit that this album rocks.  If you have the money to get this album or an idea for a gift, this is it.  Don't waste your time with any other album, let this be the first one you buy.
B000002GYW|5.0|The critics have pretty much always held up Hotel California as the greatest Eagles album and the first Greatest Hits collection (1971-75) as all we really need from the pre-Hotel days, but I have never agreed. While Hotel is an undeniably impressive record, it is clearly the product of a different  group than the Frey/Henley/Leadon/Meisner quartet which was the nucleus of the first four albums. And of those four discs, which are all great, Desperado is simply the best. From start to finish, this record is nothing but one great song after another. I love them all, but  on side two (on my vinyl version!) we get &quot;Certain Kind of Fool,&quot; &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Bitter Creek,&quot; three of the best things these guys ever did...For me, this group was just never the same without Bernie Leadon's bluegrass influence and Randy Meisner's rock &amp; roll heart. This stuff is endlessly listenable. Truly a &quot;desert island disc.&quot; Essential.
B00005OLY5|5.0|VAL KILMER. What more do you need? How about Action, Comedy, Romance, and Magic? Well, you get all of that in this movie. You'll Laugh, you'll Cry. You'll Shudder, you'll Sigh. And you'll want to watch it over and over again. It's a movie the entire family will enjoy. Plus Val Kilmer has never looked better.
B00004SVID|5.0|As a matter of fact, this is the best live album I own, even surpassing Ummagumma and Radiohead's brilliant I Might Be Wrong EP. The Floyd add flavor to all of the songs, making an already-excellent album better. Even songs like &quot;Young Lust&quot; that didn't work in the studio stand out here, filled with new guitar and keyboard (!) solos that make them more energetic. You are doing yourself a grave disservice if you don't pick this up as soon as possible. Out of all the Floyd albums, this is definatly in my top five, up there with More, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and Animals
B00006LSCX|5.0|This two disc set is a special reissue of her first-rate FEVER set along with a disc of remixes.  The album disc actually contains a re-recorded version of her current single 'Come Into My World'--the fact is that no amount of re-recording can help what is ultimately just a subpar retake on the far superior 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head'.  That's the sole weak spot in an otherwise seamless set.  The remix disc, however, is pretty flawless.  Among the highlights is the 'Blue Monday' remix of 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head', which doesn't add or detract much from the original.  There's also an excellent remix of the aforementioned '..World', the sterling U.S. radio mix of the already fab 'Love At First Sight'(which is apparently exclusive to this set), as well as the superb soundtrack cut 'Whenever You Feel Like It'.  All in all, a must for firm Kylie fans.
B000075BFK|5.0|Fan of Rap Music for yrs. and my rap star is ofcourse Tupac.<BR>I mean whose isn't?<br />I ran to Best Buy and bought this CD.<br />Long awaited CD for me..especially in the rap section.<br />I'm not going to give a full detailed review, YET.<br />BUT BE WARNED:<br />This is one awesome CD.<BR>I finished the first cd already..and its awesome, packed w/ the hottest beats I've heard in Pac cds in a while;however, 2Pac cds aren't abt beats, but abt the awesome lyrics.<br />The only thing I dont like is how numerous artists like Nas, Trick Daddy end up on a song w/ him.<br />If Pac was alive, would this be happening? NO!<br />Even if there are some guest stars, Pac still holds the mic and will captivate you. <br />Awesome CD! <br />&lt;Malu&gt;
6303192459|5.0|I think this more expensive edition is the one with some 8x10 photos from the movie and a copy of the script with Audrey's notes in the margins, I couldn't tell from the product description, you might want to double check with Amazon to make sure.<br />The book, the movie, the book, the movie  . . . I cannot decide which I prefer, it varies with my mood. But the movie, well, Audrey is delicious as Holly Golightly, an independent party girl, running, well, more like taking graceful steps in a fab Givenchy gown, away from herself and her past and into the arms of middle-aged business men to all the chic places in New York.<br />Then Paul baby, or Fred baby,(played by a way, way pre A-team George Pepard, who is as handsome a fellow as you may see on the screen) depending on who you are, moves into her building, himself a kept man by a cooing, oozy, middle-aged, bridge-playing Patricia Neal, who fancies herself as an interior decorator, although it is merely a hobby, and boy does she stink! You just hope that Paul/Fred doesn't wake up there with a bad hang-over!<br />There's a great party scence at Holly's apartment, where she meets Rusty Trawler (what a great name!) and Jose something too long to remember. You also get to see a hideous but weirdly comical performance by Mickey Rooney as a horribly stereo-typed Asian guy,Japanese, I think, complete with thick round glasses and buck teeth, I cringe every time he appears, which luckily is not often. There is also a small role for Buddy Ebsen, I think his performance as Doc Golightly won him the later role of Jed Clampett in the Beverly Hillbillies.<br />Anyway, Paul/Fred and Holly meet, become friends, bonded by their mutual states of being \\"kept\\" by others, hang-out in great New York, and then, after Holly sets her sights on Jose and starts to learn how to cook and Paul/Fred starts seriously renewing his attempts to write another book, they go there own ways. In the end, well, I don't want to give it away, but it's a sweet ending, one that made me cry a few tears. All in all a satisfying movie, in which Audrey embodies Capote's Holly.nding, one that made me cry a few tears. All in all a satisfying movie, in which Audrey embodies Capote's Holly.
079073463X|5.0|I really liked this movie. At first I only wanted to watch it because it starred Matthew Broderick. But, after watching it, I found it to be a wonderful movie, containing a fabulous love story. Plus I love horses and hawks, and both are key characters.<BR>If you haven't seen this movie, SEE IT!
B000002OX7|5.0|This is a great CD even if it was made from leftovers from the \\"Lifehouse\\" project. Who's next has the awesome \\" Won't get fooled again\\", \\"Bargain\\", \\"Baba o' Riley\\" the somewhat mello, \\"The song is over\\", \\"Gettin' in tune\\" and \\"Behind blue eyes\\". This CD even has the humourous classic \\"My wife\\" by John Entwistle.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|First lets get one thing straight im not a big rap or metal fan  the only rap i like is underground rap. im usually a pop-punk fan, but RATM is amazing!!!! Zach De La Rocha is the most talented musician i have ever seen. ok the rest of the band isn't that talented though, but zack is all you need. they have the best lyrics ever of any band. RATM kicks ...!!!
B000066NW0|3.0|Everyone is trying to put Avril into a genre where he/she thinks that Avril belongs!<br />Well... you either like or want to listen to Avril or not!  Lets not criticise the genre of her music or any other bands/artists!  If you people want to listen to the album... then listen to it!  If not, then... DON'T, and stop moaning!!!<br />Who cares if she is or isn't punk!  Before anyone could say anything... she is acceptably classed as pop/punk.  Avril isn't totally pop or punk!<br />Who could say that she's pop anyway?  There are people out there saying that NFG, Weezer, Linkin Park and other bands similar to those are 'POP'!!!  Which they are not!  So, who's suitable out there to say what's what nowadays... no one I guess!<br />So, in future... if anyone likes this album or any other albums out there by anyone else... just listen to it.  If not... don't and really stop moaning about it... coz it's getting on peoples nerves!!!<br />Oh, and words like 'SK8R BOI' are infact 'SHORT HAND' (except 'BOI')!  For people who don't know what short hand is... ask someone who works in the business world... cause they use it alot in meetings whilst writting notes!  So... words like that are not childish!  So... and again, if people don't know what's what... just keep quiet... it's for the best!!!  <br />And all the albums in the world do not deserve a full star rating... cause there's no such thing as a 100% album or 100% anything!<br />Anyway... 'Let Go'... an average album!
0440219078|5.0|This is great literature.  The story appeals to your curiosity and then you are sucked in emotionally.  Super thought provoking, great for stimulating discussions on the importance and challenges of freedom.
B000002C1W|4.0|This cd may not be true Pink Floyd. It is still worth it<br />because of David Gilmour's strong songwriting and awesome guitar solos.This is one of my favorites because I'm also a David Gilmour fan. Some good songs are Learning to fly, Signs of life, The dogs of war, On the turning away, Yet another movie, and Terminal Frost.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave...a band comprised of the Chris Cornell from Soundgarden and the remaining members of Rage Against The Machine: Tom Morello, Brad Wilk, and who could forget Timmy C.! These are all members of two of the greatest bands of our generation: Before ever hearing this album, I knew it was going to be a masterpiece of rock. And it turned out to be even better than I had imagined. In this modern day of [bad] music, such as Blink 182 and Limp Bizkit...most \\"rock\\" these days, isnt really rock at all. But Audioslave really hit the nail on the head with this album. This is 100%, full out, balls-to-the-walls rock and roll. The album opens up with their first single, \\"Cochise\\". The intro to this song is probably the most powerful intro to an album that I have ever heard. From there, song after song are just excellent. My personal favorite on the album is \\"Shadow On The Sun\\". This song goes from mild in the beginning, to all-out heavy rock at the end of it. They even branched out and have a few slower songs, such as \\"Like A Stone\\". Audioslave have an amazing ability to play and write a wide variety of music, something that Rage Against the Machine was never able to do (Zach was a great vocalist...but I could never have imagined him singing slower songs). This is by far the best album purchase that I have made this year. I would recommend this for any Soundgarden fan, any Rage fan, or anyone who wants to hear some of the only true rock and roll being played today. I give this album 5 stars out of 5, DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS ALBUM!
B000002LND|1.0|SInce when Madonna has recorded anyhting &quot;essential&quot;? She only gave the world a collection of the worst that commercial pop music can offer: souless tunes, music made like if it was a music factory, using the media when she wanted and HOW she wanted it; making outrageous live performances to disguise the silliness of the songs.

B000069HKH|4.0|I don´t care if it talks about September 11th or not. Bruce lyrics, in general, where always very good. I just care about that this is fine new album by Bruce, one that will do absolutely no damage to his discography and that of the E-Street band. Much on the contrary: THE RISING is a solid output. He even worked for the first time with producer Brendan O´Brien, that produced Pearl Jam and Offspring, amongst others,for the sake of &quot;keping in touch&quot; with modern times, I guess...<br />To see such a band recording new material after 18 years (without taking account of the few original tracks released in 1995)is a breathtaking experience (check the DVD &quot;BLOOD BROTHERS&quot; to see what I mean).<br />THE RISING is great, and there´s no point comparing it to BORN TO RUN or anything. TImes change, even Bruce´s voice has changed a lot, nothing is forever. THE RISING is the product of a top rock artist still in the top of his game, recording at the 21st Century.
B00007E8V4|5.0|steal this album is quite better than toxicity, even if is not real new material.......the new mixed versions of streamline and innervision are great..the album is heavier than ever you won't be dissapinted I hope that they won't get so pop like in toxicity......trust me this is real good stuff...why trust me cuz I'm the first reviewer of this album that's the only reason.......fin
B000065V41|5.0|Well I have to say it is everything you would expect from the muppets. Gonzo and his friend &quot;Rat&quot; are the story tellers and extremely funny I might add.  It's great holiday fun and no regrets at all adding this to my collection. I am 24, no kids and most my friends are my age as well and we watch it and love it so it is definitely for families of all ages not just the little ones.  I recommend it, I promise you'll enjoy it and watch it enough to get your moneys worth :o)

I can't think of anyone who could have played the parts better than Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Farrell! I definitely recommend this movie...it will make you laugh like no other movie!
B000075BFK|5.0|Well, listening to this cd makes everyone think once again, is he really dead? how can so many ill rhymes be kept hidden for so long? All i gotta say is that you better get this album, its great.
B000002JPA|5.0|Just plain awesome.  If you like Metallica, Iron Maiden or anything like that you'll like this CD.  This is definitley Dream Theater's best album.

B00006RU5B|5.0|I think that the new debut album by Audioslave is awesome. It should cause quite a commotion in the hard rock world. Chris Cornell came from out of the ashes and saved the remaining members of Rage Against The Machine. I feel that they will eventually become one of the best hard rock bands.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This project represents the successful combination of one of the best voices in rock history with one of the most unique bands in sound and style.  The shredding vocals of Chris Cornell are the perfect overlay to the heavy unique bass lines and angry guitars you loved Rage Against the Machine for.  Some songs sound more like Soundgarden, some more like Rage, and some sound like a perfect balance.  Definitely a must-have in any grungers' collection.
B000002UY5|5.0|I remembering hearing &quot;No Rain&quot; when it first came out on the radio and it instantly became my childhood favorite [I was about 8 at the time]. &quot;No Rain&quot; is a good song and went on to be a decent hit, but unfortunately it turned out to be the only big hit by what turned out to be one of the most underrated bands of the 90's. After seeing the 'Behind The Music' on them I decided to get the cd and it wasn't a dissapointment at all. Sure, No Rain is great but so are &quot;Dear Ol' Dad&quot;, &quot;I Wonder&quot;, &quot;Drive&quot; and every last one of the songs on this album. There seriously isn't a single bad track [my personal favorite however, besides &quot;No Rain&quot;, is &quot;Change&quot;]. If you like Jane's Addiction, The Violent Femmes, or heck, even Green Day then you'll probably like Blind Melon {I mean heck, I usually listen to grunge and hard rock and I still like them]. All of their albums are great and worth buying but their debut, in my opinion, is their best. So do yourself a favor and discover the wonders of Blind Melon!

B00004TH83|4.0|This young singer caught my attention when she did a number on the World Music Awards last year.  I went to Amazon[.com] to buy this cd (Used)in hopes I would not be disappointed, and guess what -- I WASN'T!  It is fantastic.  Lara's voice is strong and forceful, she evokes feelings with her melodies and each track will treat you to a different facet of her talent.  This is a keeper.  I hope she is around for many years to come.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Okay, her self titled debut album was great.  She showcased her beatiful vocals.  But on the 2nd album Stripped she dives deep into pitfalls of stardom, her maturity,her past, her sexuality, and her overall womanhood.<br />1)Stripped Intro -a nice way to start off the album , letting everyone know,that finally this is the real Christina.  8/10<br />2)Can't Hold Us Down - I like this track, it is one of the few uptempo songs on the album.  I wish we could have heard more from the guest-starring lil' kim, but its a good song and expresses women empowerment. 8.5/10<br />3)Walk Away- my favorite song on the entire CD.  You feel C.A.'s pain on this one.  And the thing that makes it great, is that the message in the song is something we can all relate to, leaving something that we love, but we need to leave.10/10<br />4)Fighter - It took a while for this track to grow on me but it eventually did. I love the different type of style Christina took on this one and her vocals standout over the rocking guitar.  9/10<br />5) Orimer Amor Intelude- I like, becuase I know some Spanish so its nice to her.  She sounds beautiful. 8/10<br />6)Infatuation - this track probably most resembles music from her debut.  It's still real catchy, and she goes back to her roots with this latin beat. 8.5/10<br />7)This is a beatiful interlude, the smoothness of it is captivationg. 9/10<br />8)One of my favorite songs on the album.  I love the soulfulness of the song.  This song could have easily been done by soul divas, Erykah Bady, Jill Scott, or India Arie.  Christina flawlesy flows over the music.  10/10<br />9)Impossible - Alicia Keyes wrote this song.  It definitely sounds like her even with Christina singing.  I love it though, very bluesy Christina sounds powerful.  9/10<br />10)Underappreciated - I like it .  probably the only song on the c.d. that could be classified as filler.  It's aight, an uptempo.  8/10<br />11) Beautiful - Is what it is called...BEAUTIFUL!! I'm so glad that her management company and her have decided this to ber her second single, she has never sounded better, but the only problem I have with this song is that ...It wasn't the first single! 10/10<br />12)Make Over - even though I'm not much of a rocker, Xtina pulls it off and I really enjoy it. She sounds like a mix between Gwen Stefani,Shirley Manson and Alanis Morisette.  8.5/10<br />13)Cruz- another beatiful song on the album.  The first song that first captivated me.  I really enjoy it.  A wonderful ballad.  A journey song, xtina is on her own and loving it.  9/10<br />14)Soar - Another beautiful ballad (all the ballads are beautiful) very inspirational.  Very uplifting, could have easily been done by Celine Dion.<br />15)Get Mine Get Yours- very r &b and I love it.  It took a while for it to grow on me, but it did.  Its just about casual sex and no strings attached.  Its aight,Xtina can get her freak on too.  9/10<br />16)Dirrty - everyone knows this controversial song and video.  I really enjoy it but after hearing the c.d., it relly doesnt fit in.  I like the vibe her and Redman have, but i'm really upset that she released this as her first single, There were abot 5 songs that would have represented the album  better and have been more succesful. But I dont care what no one else thinks...the video is HOT!! 8.5/10<br />17)Stripped part 2 - I like this interlude more than the first one.  She proclaims what she likes dislikes and that she's not a ......., well you'll have to find that one out for yourself. 9/10<br />18)The Voice Within - Another one of the best songs on the album.  Very inspirational, but better than \\"Soar\\", listen to yourself and no one else. 9.5/10<br />19) I'm Okay- probably the most revealing ad powerful songs on the album, equivalent to Pink's \\"Family Portrait\\" It's wonderful it mixes the pain and talent of Christina Aguilera.  She is actually crying on the record.  It's great, it would be wonderful if she released this one.  10/10<br />20) Keep on Singing My Song  - Most albums tend to end the c.d. with any old song, but the this one keeps on the message of \\"Stripped\\" beleive in yourself and never give up. 9/10<br />Overall \\"stripped\\" is a 10/10!!!! ITs wonderful if u love Pink's \\"Misundaztood\\", you'll love this one.  She is so true and sexy and smart, and confident, and strong.  She has grown as an artist as a woman and person.  She is beautiful and I hope this cd continues to propel her into the limelight that she continues to deserve.  And don't let \\"Dirrty\\" fool you, the cd is great.<BR>There is also another song, called \\"I Will Be\\" if it was on the cd it would have the strongest vocals.  \\"I Will Be\\" has the strongest vocals from any singer in the world, I have heard recently.  \\"Stripped\\" is very mellowed out, but you'll find it theraputic to let her songs touch your heart and speak to your mind.  Look out for \\"Beautiful\\" its the epitomy of beautiful.  AAGHHH...just go buy it!!! Support an artist that has grown and actually has talent. Christina I love you.
B000007R1M|5.0|I use to be a professional break dancer , this was my favorite disk for background ( I was working in &quot; life robot &quot; technique).<BR> Than in early 90th , I had to drive all over the country : LA - Interstate 40 - loud Kraftwerk and huge jar of coffee - a little over 2 days - Hello , DC ! This was fun ! I love this album !
6304539258|5.0|Classic, late 70's space opera was very much the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA of it's day.
B00000J7I3|4.0|In my opinion, this is the best album Motley Crue released.  It is full of an eneregy that they seemed to lose somewhere along the way.  You can clearly hear that eighties LA glam scene and the boys do not seem bored by what they are doing (as in some later albums).  They are having a good time and you can hear the drive and ambition in the music too.<BR>Musically, although I admit I know little about music arrangements, this CD has some memorable guitar riffs, particularly in Live Wire and Public Enemy Number One.  Merry Go Round I would say is a weaker track.<BR>Play it loud, get out your leather, rubber/PVC and make up and relive the eighties glam rock scene!
B00006LFGD|4.0|This is a wonderful recording! I really loved the new duet with Josh Gorban and of course the Manilow Duet is nice. But some how they don't live up to the other career spanning duets. I feel almost a little sad listening to this new CD because have the feeling Barbra's career is coming to a close. Sure they'll be a album every year or so but she doesn't have the same passion in her selection of songs or in her voice. The lady is in love and that' s seems to be most important to her. Who can blame her! I am the ultimate Streisand fan and have been since the 70s. But I miss those albums like Gulity, Wet, Lazy Afternoon, etc... I remember when a new Streisand release used to be the highlight of the year!<br />Thanks Barbra for all you've given to us! I love you.<br />One final note:  I agree with one reviewer here, it would have been so much more exciting if Barbra had released a cd of all the songs that didn't make it on her albums.  I have read they arre several including two or three that never made it on  her masterpiece album, Guilty . Please no more greatest hits packages!
B00005YW4H|4.0|this is a great CD to get romantic to or to have a long hot bath too.  I also really agree with what one of the other reviewers said about  it reminding them of Christmas.  It is a perfect Christmas CD.  It evokes log fires and big snuggly beds,even  snow!  Not sure why that is.  <BR>I also agree with what the reviewer said about her own songs not being as strong as the others.  Although not AS good they most certainly are good.<BR>As for the person that was saying that the formula gets a bit boring after a while,( or words to that effect).  I would disgree with that.  What is the point of Norah trying to experiment with other styles when she is best at what she is currently doing?  This is a mistake many aritsts make and I am glad Norah has not gone down this road and done some kind of poppy ballad or something.  She has found an easy bluesy style that suits her vocal and sicks to it.<BR>Like a modern day Billie Holiday, Norah Jones music clings to your soul and is perfect for a romantic wintery day alone or with a lover.
B00006JDVV|4.0|REIGN OF FIRE is a dragon movie set in a MAD MAX post apocolyptic future. It's a great concept. However, I beleiev that there's more the writers and director could have given us. But I refuse to be another person who gives this a negative review. It is A GOOD MOVIE!! Minus a few slow spots, I enjoyed myself throughout and I've seen it three times. <br />Matthew McConauhey delivers a one of a kind performance that I haven't seen in a film for a long time. He's kind of like Quint from JAWS only meaner and more complex. McConauhey's role in this film made me wish he would do more genre films. He's a good actor why waste talent in things like THE WEDDING PLANNER or THIRTEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING?<br />Check this out! While it is in no way a perfect film, the effects are spectacular and the film WILL entertain!! Just take it for what it is, a big budget popcorn flick.<br />B-
0156907399|5.0|This is quite simply, the most beautiful, illuminating, and period-defining book I have ever read.  The prose is smooth and fluid, and if you let it carry you into the book, it will completely absorb you.  I understand how stream-of-consciousness can be difficult, but rather than fighting the stream in an attempt to understand every sentence, I recommend 'going with the flow' for the first few pages and letting your visceral reactions to the emotions and ideas in the book guide you.<br />This is a book about transitions; from childhood to adulthood, from an era of clearly defined roles to one of liberation; it is a book about the things people need from each other but have difficulty communicating; it is a book about the impossibility of communication and the other subtle ways we attempt to bridge the divide between ourselves and other people.  I doubt these topics will ever be addressed as elegantly.
B000075BFK|5.0|When I went to pick the CD for the first time it was sold out which shows people still show interest. I picked it up some where else for only 15 bucks(best buy) as apposed to 18 on this site. The first thing you notice about the beats is that they are too modern for tupac and that he wouldn't have them if he was still alive. The lyrics are probably his deepest with perfect flow as always. For fans of R U still down this CD is probably just as good but, maybe not on the same level as Until the end of Time. I just hope the one set for fall of 2003 is comparable.
0802130208|5.0|Ezra Pound wrote that if you can keep going back to something and it has lost nothing, well then, you have Art of the first intensity on your hands. 'A Confederacy of Dunces' has this quality for me as does Widor's toccata: Symphony #5 op. 42 by a organist good enough to play it or Duvall's 'The Apostle', to name a couple of other masterpieces.<BR>There are so many great reviews of 'Dunces' here that I won't even try. However, here's the thing, where I work [a retail chain store] we renamed 'Levy Pant', we have our Trixie, I have a sign above my desk: \\"Where you keep them motherf'ing broom?\\", maybe a sign: \\"Nice Wine....$3.99.\\" when we have one on ad for $3.99. We have a Lee mother, If you shop at our store, one of our cashiers might make your change with something like, \\"Your change is 94 cent.\\" etc. etc. So, I guess when a book alters the actions of your life, it must be pretty good. I know that on days when I'm feeling sunk, I can go back to it and it will snap me right out of it.<BR>And ain't most of our corporations managed more like \\"Levy Pants\\" than anything else nowadays?
B00006CXSS|5.0|I can only speak great things about this show.  I am in England and I saw this on TV one night and all I can say is it was AWESOME.  I can also confirm that the majority of my friends loved it.  If you watch the first ten minutes you will probably not stop till it's over.  I highly recommend this one.
B000002A46|5.0|A very amazing Xmas cd.  The best Christmas CD out there tied with the California Raisons ;) but Mariah shows how good she is on the mic.  Her vocals are so distinctive and unique.  Great for any MC fan or for any Christmas CD collector.
B000070WJE|2.0|A star can't shine forever, ain't it ? At least to me ! Mind you, I was a big Robbie fan, owning all his albums and singles, until he turned Sinatra. Being the most decorated Brit popstar, and later managed to be a sweet ol' crooner, really got to his head I suppose ! None of the 14 songs here is even worthy of mention. Simply said, they are all tuneless and void of melody. I can't even remember a single tune here, not to mention his arrogant lyrics (especially in &quot;Handsome Man&quot;). Has any songs been released as singles ? Not that I know of. Well, none of em is good enough !
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album is a must-buy for anyone who appriciates System Of A Down or just modern Metal. The songs range from the quiet but powerfull 'Roulette' (Nu-Metal with a string section?) to the bouncy, fast and bizzare 'Chic N Stu' chanting &quot;Pizza pie, pizza pie. Advertising causes therapy&quot;. This is at least as good as the previous 2 albums and fans will not be dissapointed. I give the album 5 stars for the very original cover design alone. Buy It!
B00006RU5B|5.0|This CD is great.  It brings together the sounds of two great groups.  As usual Chris Cornell's voice is unbelievable and with the sound of the band is just incredible.  The CD is a definite must have.
B00005JL3A|1.0|...its ment to be prequal to the resi series but trust me it does dissapoint. instead of the fear,action and gore that makes resident evil great the movie gives us shabby effects on nearly everything including the zombies and the licker. not scary at all... it cuts off every time something gory happens.just like the fake looking zombies the dog(cerebus) effects are as good as pouring spagetti over them. also the movie uses stupid stunts...
0066620996|5.0|Every once and a while a business book comes along that revolutionizes our thinking and becomes a classic.  Good to great is just such a book.  The book starts with the provocative statement &quot;Good is the enemy of great.&quot;  Collins then develops objective criteria that differentiated the good from the great companies, and noted that there is a point at which the great companies started behaving remarkably differently from their good counterparts.  The great companies  &quot;attained extraordinary results, averaging cumulative stock returns 6.9 times the general market in the fifteen years following their transition from good to great.&quot;  Collins then compares these extraordinary companies with other companies, which remained good but did not reach the transition from good to great.  <br /> Amongst the factors that differentiated the great companies were level 5 leadership, hiring the right people and letting go of the wrong, confronting all of the facts -- especially the brutal ones, developing an incredible focus and a culture of discipline, using technology accelerators, developing momentum that reaches a critical mass.  <br />This book is like a superb seven course meal and it will challenge your view of the world as it did mine - and we will all be better off for having read it.
B000075BFK|5.0|This great album is a tribute to what a great talent pac was.  If he was with us today there is no doubt that he would have been on top. All around he is greatest of all time.<BR>RIP PAC

B000002BPS|5.0|My brother introduced me to the offsring a long time ago. They are by far my favorite band! Ixnay on the hombre is definitely my favorite cd of theirs. This is the kind of music that you turn up so loud when no one is home and jst enjoy it so much! my favorite songs are probably &quot;Mota&quot; and &quot;Gone Away&quot;. I know basically every word to all these songs by heart and scream them at the top of my lungs when no ones around. Punk rock kicks a** and this is definitely no exception!
B00000720W|5.0|Raw, classic, great.. yeah Deathcrush has it all.. classic songs and everything.. if you don't have it.... you're a FU**NG POSER!
B000075BFK|4.0|Its really amazing, I mean he has been gone for 6 years and somehow they keep finding tracks, I picked it up the first day it came out, and I am not dissappointed(sp?). I cant give it 5 stars for the simple reason 5 stars makes a classic, and while this is not a classic, it is very well constructed compared to Until the End of Time, although a good album in its own right. The point is, 2Pac conveys the lyrics to the audience with a way that can only be seen as impeccable. Ja Rule and Jay Z and whoever else can copy songs or \\"remake\\" 2Pac songs but all they are doing is an injustice to themselves and music in general. You cannot compare 2Pac to any other rapper. He is going to outsell them in death, and its been awhile, thats saying alot, and while its not about a salary and all about reality, 2Pac has that attribute going for him as well. He is known as the realest rapper there ever was for a reason. He makes you believe him the way he raps it. While there are bad spots on the album, especially \\"There U Go\\", which is a silly track to me, I actually laughed at the chorus, this is for a seldom few. \\"Fu*k'Em All\\" is another average track. While some may moan and groan about the making of new beats compared to the originals, they only say this because they are used to the original versions, and for obvious reasons, they have been listening to them for years now, but in time they will see the new versions are much better. High points would be \\"My Block\\", \\"Catching Feelings\\",\\"Thugz Mansion\\",\\"Changed Man\\", and both versions of \\"Fair Xchange\\". Now this CD has a flow to it that is awesome, highly recommended to any hip-hop head. Best rap album I have heard in some years. 2Pac does it again.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Alright, so I got the Audioslave cd the day it came out. Let me just say this... it's the BEST album I've heard for a while. The vocals are flawless, the guitars and drums are amazing, and the finished product is well worth a listen. The sound is definitely new, and rather unique... I've never heard anything quite like it. It's definitely worth the money to buy it, it hasn't left my cd player since I got it!
B0000062Y2|5.0|It was the best show to go see in the seventies. It was fantastic, great reveiws, and music. I own the orginal soundtrack. It was and is the most moving show and if they put it on the screen again I would make a trip to go see it again and again.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Solid.  That's word for this album.  I find it hard to find a song I don't really care for.  Tom Morello is a guitar-god(I love you Tom!) and a couldn't say enough for Cornell, with a truly revolutionary voice.  The guitar effects and the structure of the songs is incendiary.  A definite buy for any rock fan.  Quite a debut cd.
B000002UZ4|5.0|If you were in your teens as i was when the PSB were hitting the charts from the mid '80's on, you had probably been dancing to their tunes anytime you entered a disco, been assaulted by their music anytime you turned on the radio...and mostly would have loved them for being so out of the British marketing rules.<BR>WEST END GIRLS hit big in the USA (# 1) in 1986.<BR>LOVE COMES QUICKLY and SUBURBIA are stereo-oriented, IT'S ALRIGHT and DOMINO DANCING are just made for the dancefloor, BEING BORING and JEALOUSY prove you can be a dance group and yet come up with ballads (or something quite close to them...).<BR>WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS is a tribute to big-brassed tune...<BR>You really can't risk not to own this one!
B000005L86|5.0|Congo Bongo was video game i played on my atari, but this cd is fantastic roots reggae.  I think lee perry oversaw this.  The person that crafted the liner notes to the album did a exemplary job explaining the importance of this band, reflecting much knowledge and respect (plus a taste for some really creative collage photography). I'm not a roots head, don't rock dreds, and regrettably, have never visited jamaica.  But I love low-fi reggae and dub, and this is perfect; there is a harmony of two voices, one high one low, great dubbed out effects in some places.  If you feel old school b. marley, augustus pablo, the abyssinians, etc. you'll probably like this.
B000002UZ6|5.0|It was inevitable, after 3 extra-successful albums, Tina came up with this hell of a compilation.<BR>I am not going to review all the hits all the world knows about.<BR>Thanks God the label decided to include also WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER HERO (her smash from Summer 1985) and the too-quickly-discarded single BE TENDER WITH ME BABY.<BR>If you decide to buy this, just be aware you get 4 new tracks:<BR>the '90's version of her classic NUTBUSH CITY LIMITS, very disco-oriented...could have been better, though...<BR>Then the previously unreleased tracks appear at the end of the playlist: WAY OF THE WORLD is the typical Tina's ballad, LOVE THING is as rock as Tina can be and I WANT YOU NEAR ME is reggae-flavoured.<BR>And all of them deserves being on such an important collection.<BR>Tina Rocks Once More!
B000065V9P|5.0|Gabriel's lyrics have always been somewhat personal, despite abstract notions in his earlier works (especially those with Genesis), but Gabriel makes his emotions obvious in Us. It's even stated in the liner notes that most of this album is about relationships, particularly his divorce from his wife Jill, and his romantic involvement with Rosanna Arquette. This results in some of the most passionate vocals ever, exhibited in songs like &quot;Come Talk To Me,&quot; &quot;Digging in the Dirt,&quot; and &quot;Fourteen Black Paintings.&quot; This might've been his return to pop music after disappearing from the commercial spotlight after So, but he certainly made his long-awaited return (before promptly vanishing again) a rather dark one.
B000066NW0|3.0|The album is solid, with catchy tunes and a couple of great songs here and there (though her lyrics fail miserably at times - awkward and out of place). &quot;I'm with you&quot;, &quot;Mobile&quot; and &quot;Nobody's fool&quot; are notable mentions.<br />What I do not get about some of the people in here is why are they comparing her to the likes of singers wirh more life and music experience. Listen to this album like how you would treat an individual. Yes, her lyrics might sound cheesy at times, yes she might sound like she's already got it figured out but isn't that how teenagers are? Just listen and remember that this is just ONE girl's point of view how 17 feels like. And there are 17 year olds of the world that write Sk8ter Boi and even sKaTeR bOI. We know better and yes it's annoying but that's what they're doing. Her album is just to show you her world, that's all. Would you prefer it if she tried acting all grown up at her age?<br />She isn't a musically inclined genius but her debut album is good enough from a girl her age. At least she's putting her music out there at such a young age. <br />Give her time.
B000066NW0|4.0|I'm not a punk. I'm not a teenybopper. I'm not a classification. I'm not a blah blah blah. I'm a music lover. I listen to whatever sounds good...cheesy pop or \\"real music\\". I don't ever listen to anything just because it's \\"cool\\" or avoid stuff because it's \\"uncool\\". ... So I will say, I think Avril Lavigne's album Let Go sounds good.<BR>  Image aside, Let Go is a good album. There are some cringy lyrics (using the most basic vocabulary, suggesting that all us teens talk like thickos). Some very good tunes though, which I think is the ultimate neccessity for a good song. Lyrics don't come near. And boy, can Miss Lavigne sing. Apprently, she's tiny, but her voice sure is strong. Highlights: 'Losing Grip' (aggressive and emotion filled) 'Complicated' (the most unoriginal song in the world EVER, but so ... catchy) 'I'm with You' (a good slow one).<BR> As for Avril herself...well, I didn't come here to review her image, but if you listen to the album without thinking of her and her silly schoolgirl lyrics (a bit of a difficult task, but it'll do wonders), you'll see it's a very unoriginal, but GOOD album (whoever said you had to be original to be good? Although it's better if you are, but still...give the public what they want.)
B00005U2LM|4.0|Sometimes it's hard to be impartial when reviewing a band/group/artist you really like. That is the case at hand, but I must admit that this is by far the weakest album by Wu-Tang. I couldn't wait to buy this as soon as it came out, but I heard the complete album before its release and wasnt too happy. Wu-Tang is known for their unique, dark beats, but this album is commercialized as far as beats go. Don't get me wrong though, the lyrics are tight, typical Wu style. The two people that make this album good, Method Man and Inspectah Deck. A suprise in this album is the improvement of the not-so-good Cappadonna. Ghostface is Ghostface, bringing the random, yet hot verses to this cut. U-God &amp; Raekwon have seemed to decline lyrically over the past few years, but still do a decent job on the Iron Flag. <BR>RZA &amp; GZA both remain solid, and RZA has even improved lyrically. RZA's best work is still on Wu-Tang Forever. Masta Killa isn't on the album that often, which really isn't a good thing because he could have displayed his improvement. (For an example of this, check out Mortal Kombat by Afu-ra.) Below is the track rating (1-5):<br />In The Hood: 5<BR>Rules: 5+<BR>Chrome Wheels: 3<BR>Soul Power: 1 ( The beat is so annoying)<BR>Uzi: 4<BR>One Of These Days: 3.5<BR>Y'all Been Warned: 5<BR>Babies: 3<BR>Radioactive: 3.5<BR>Back In The Game: 4.5<BR>Iron Flag: 4<BR>Dashing: 4.5
B00006RU5B|5.0|Ony great Musicians like Chris Cornell and the Rage guys could ever record such phonomenial tunes. This album is even better then when I first heard Nirvana\\"s Teen Spirit. The Grunge scene is back again. Once you have played this album from Audioslave it takes you back to the Grunge days in Seattle. Brilliant vocals from Chris Cornell. I can't even begin to describe how successful this album will be. I have been a HUGE Soundgarden fan for years, but this can't even compare. Please I encourage anyone who admires great music, to really check this out. If is well worth the money spent. I wish they stay together forever and I hope they get the show on with Pearl Jam, that would be like a tear from an eye dreaming. Chris Cornell ROCKS!!!!!Bin Yang
B00005QG9J|5.0|Normally I listen to Blink 182 or The Prodigy but this CD made my day. After hearing &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;11am&quot; I knew that Incubus would be part of my vocabulary. When I first got it I didn't care much for it, but one day I slipped it into my car CD player it blew me away. There kind of music makes you relax and take a break from life and its problems. Even if your into rap and hip-hop you should give this CD a chance. You may be suprised. Not everyone likes this kind of music at first, but like me I had to take a chance and it became a part of my life. Just try it. Sometimes your music tastes change.
B00006JDVV|5.0|Matthew McConaughey lights up 'Reign of Fire' in his best performance since 'U-571'! Which if you've seen 'U-571' you would find unbelieveable, inless of course you saw 'Reign of Fire' in theatres as I did. But besides Mr. McConaughey the dragons look as terrifing as ever but at the same time dazzling. So from the extordinary acting (Christian Bale,Matthew McConaughey) to the spectacular special effects and graphics (dragons, sky divers, castles etc.) 'Reign of Fire' is HOTT!!!
B00007E8V4|1.0|If you didn't know the reason for the title of this album \\"steal this album\\" is because these outtakes from the toxicity session where stolen and placed on the Internet (um-mixed or mastered) over 6 months ago..now with that in mind this is the reason the band does not care about this album is because the songs are non-album material, so don't be fooled into thinking this is a new system of a down album THIS IS NOT..take the bands advice and download this album
0066214122|5.0|\\"Prey\\" deserves five stars, not because its the Great American Novel, but because it's as perfect an example of the Michael Crichton Science Fiction Thriller as one could imagine. If you liked his last ten books, you'll love this one. If you're already lukewarm to his work, \\"Prey\\" won't convert you.<br />Any fan of Crichton will recognize the basic dynamics tensions and characters that drive the story. There's the Good Guy Scientist/Technologist. There's the Overreaching Ambitious Predatory Female (a former VC this time, rather than a lawyer-- one must move with the times, after all). There are a couple Bad Scientist/Management Types. And, finally, there a variety of lesser characters, variations of Ensign Expendable on Star Trek, the person you'd never seen on the show before who beams down to the planet and gets to look behind the quivering fanged rock. I almost called them \\"ancestors\\" of the good ensign, but they inevitably get killed off before the can reproduce, bloodying the various set-piece action scenes that commence after the set-piece tour of the remote facility slash science tutorial. Where's that critical piece of gear that will kill off the baddies once and for all? Oh no! It's not here in the super-secure control center, it's in the outbuilding. Someone must go and get it. Do the creatures have their own hiding place? Will it be found in time? Will a reluctant team member possibly lose their nerve at a critical moment?<br />Strangely, you know the answer, but the suspense will still kill you. Like \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"Prey\\" is really a variation on the teen slasher film. In movies like \\"Friday the 13th,\\" the story line can be summarized as: Teens Have Sex, Teens Get Killed. In \\"JP\\" and \\"Prey,\\" that's been modified (evolved?) into People Do Science, People Get Killed. The science in question this time is a mix of nanotechnology, molecular-level manufacturing, and self-organizing systems. This makes \\"Prey\\" the unlikely conclusion of the Year of Books About Emergent Behavior (see Howard Rheingold's \\"Smart Mobs,\\" Mark Taylor's \\"Moment of Complexity,\\" Albert Laszlo Barabasi's \\"Linked\\"); but at least we go out with a bang.<br />This may sound cutting, but it's not really criticism. I know it's a formula, I know the story arc, I know that we'll see a version in the Cineplex 24 in Christmas 2003. And yet I buy the book the first day it's out, stay up until the wee hours finishing it, and enjoy myself greatly. Now the real suspense begins: who will direct the movie version?t Emergent Behavior (see Howard Rheingold's \\"Smart Mobs,\\" Mark Taylor's \\"Moment of Complexity,\\" Albert Laszlo Barabasi's \\"Linked\\"); but at least we go out with a bang.<br />This may sound cutting, but it's not really criticism.

B00004Z459|5.0|One of the best rap/rock bands I ever heard.<BR>I knew that when I first saw them open up for<BR>Orgy and Disturbed at Lupo's in Providence R.I.<BR>a few years back I knew they would make it big.<BR>They are an awesome live band with alot of energy.<BR>I didn't bother buying the remix album because I<BR>don't like remix's.I love the original songs<BR>just the way the are.The album is a must have<BR>for every rap/rock fan out there.
B000063DHL|5.0|I remember hearing this album for the first time on a record. Man did that record sound like crud, but I still loved the songs anyway. This Iron Maiden album is more mellow than earlier releases, but surpasses Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, and Powerslave in overall consistent song quality.<br />Caught Somewhere In Time: Not that good and certainly not that bad. I think it deserves a B and eases you into the better songs that are to come later.<br />Wasted Years: This song has a positive message and in general is a very good song. The vocal hook is something you can sing along with. Musically it may not be one of the most impressive but still it deserve a solid B+. &quot;Stand up and face your fears. Realize you're living in the golden years.&quot; (Quote may not be entirely accurate) <br />Sea of Madness: Well, it sure has a memorable guitar riff but damn I can't remember the lyrics without cheating and looking. That has to say something about a song. That doesn't make it awful or anything, but much like Caught Somewhere In Time this is one of the weaker songs on the album and that is not that weak at all. B.<br />Heaven Can Wait: I really love the sound of this song and it really kicks but many the whole band gets involved with background vocal and &quot;Heaven Can Wait. Heaven Wait For Another Day&quot; kicks in. This is a very strong song, but not quite blowing up my &quot;skirt&quot;. B+.<br />Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner: Man, what a weird song. It has one of the best Maiden guitar riff beginnings and then kicks in a very fast-paced vocal flavor from Bruce. I guess they were trying to create the running/speed feel to the song. The tune really captures you and almost makes you feel like you could be the one pushing for the finish. Another not quite A song, but a B+. Very good song, but nothing amazing.<br />Stranger In A Strange Land: What a song this one is. It really reminds me of somebody who has just become completely jaded and sick of the way the world works. Perhaps not an inspiring song but a great one. A.<br />De Ja Vu: This is probably the weakest song on the album, but is not horrible at all. It doesn't even come close to being as bad as Acacia Avenue or Gangland on Number of the Beast. You guessed it. It is about De Ja Vu. B-.<br />Alexander The Great: This is another awe inspiring Maiden epic. Again, like Hallowed Be Thy Name from Number of the Beast and Rime of the Ancient Mariner from Powerslave, this song is one explosively long and &quot;lovely&quot; piece of metal. Hey, and according to my history teacher brother, it is historically accurate. So if you are a history student or history buff, don't watch the History Channel or read a book. Listen to Iron Maiden's synopsis of the life of Alexander the Great. A++
6302763835|5.0|How can you miss with Clint Eastwood saving the day. One of his first roles (albeit a tiny role) in this sci-fi classic. Wanting to save the world from hunger a scientist (Leo G. Caroll)injects animals with a nutrient. A Trarantula escapes and grows to giant size to reek havoc on cattle and men. John Agar, a staple of the 50's monster movies, helps to rid the world of this menace. One of my all time favorites. Once again with all the super cheese on DVD, whats the hold up with transfer for this great oldie???
B000002KHB|5.0|I believe that anyone who is a serious listener / player in different styles from Rock, Fusion, or any other type of music must have a copy of \\"Machine Head\\". As in my point of view,  is one of the milestones of rock history, particularity Electric Guitar history. <br />Tracks like \\"Highway Star\\", \\"Smoke on the Water\\", \\" Lazy\\" have classic guitar work, that no serious guitar player nor a music fan should miss. The album has a blend of Rock'n'Roll, Rock, Heavy rock, classical Bach style and elements of Jazz, all molded together in a form that is known to be Deep Purple. One of the great things about Purple, that they were unique in their own style,  to an extent that they have never been cloned by anyone else. This was due to the fact of their virtuosity as players and the great mix of styles and different elements in their music. <br />It is the ultimate representation of Blackmore/Lord/Paice/Gillan/Glover or what is know as MKII, and a forever classic that should be in every serious music fan's library. If there was more than five stars to rate, I wouldn't have hesitated.
B00000APLB|4.0|Love You Live was recorded and released in 1977, reaching number 4 in England and number 5 in America. A double album culled from the Black And Blue tour, it took the the band out of a commercial slump that had begun with Goat's Head Soup and culminated with Black And Blue.<br />Kicking off with a blistering Honky Tonk Women, the band shows how good live they can be. Billy Preston grooves on Fingerprint File and Tumbling Dice, while Ian Stuart shines on Hot Stuff, and his fantastic finger flourishes on the reinvented Get Off Of My Cloud are superb. Keith Richards and Ron Wood are excellent here, and Wood, the new member of the band, shines on Hot Stuff and Star Star. You Can't Always Get What You Want is okay. It's not as good as the one on Flashpoint.<br />Disc 2 kicks off with a scorching Mannish Boy. The guitars shine behind Mick's smoking vocals and wailing harmonica. Little Red Rooster and Around And Around are awesome. It's Only Rock 'n' Roll rocks thanks to some new, Chuck Berry-inspired licks. Brown Sugar is top-notch, and Jumpin' Jack Flash and Sympathy For The Devil close the album with style. Sympathy is a little different, more like the Ya-Ya's version. It's less of a Mexican samba and more of a fast blues.<br />As a live album, Love You Live is incomparable to Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out, but it's still worth a listen. The only problem is that there were many great songs from the tour that should have been included, e.g, Midnight Rambler, Fool To Cry, Angie, Street Fighting Man. Still, as a whole, it holds up pretty well.
B0000024JA|5.0|yo this was a classic wu solo album its freaked out by method man tical 2000 was weak but this one was ill i love almost every song every hardcore hip hop or wu fan must own almost every track is banging<BR>best tracks:bring the pain, all i need, release yo delf
B00007E8V4|4.0|This third album from System of A Down consists of tracks that go back to 1995 and have not yet been released officially.  The songs are not second rate, but merely did not fit the style of Toxicity or the self titled album.  It is a good mix of great songs, but lacks an over-all flow.  This is to be expected from a compilation though.  The various styles used generally lie between those of the other two albums as well as some very new sounds, such as the mellow but powerful &quot;Roulette,&quot; an acoustic change of pace.  By no means can this album compare with Toxicity, but it is not meant to.  The official site notes it as a bridge between Toxicity and the next album, a role which is well filled.
B000005Z0G|5.0|Tupac Shakurs second album \\"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.\\" (1993) contrasts with his first in which he was more poetic, in this album he applies more of a gangster rap feel to it. Pac confronts alot of people including Dan Qualye former vice president of U.S. who was trying to get pac's music censored at the time. \\"Holler if you hear Me\\" the lead single starts off the album strong, then interlude has Pac rejecting authority, stating hes going to do whatever he likes, a concept he carried all througout his career. \\"Last Wordz\\" Feat. Ice Cube and Ice-T, had three of hiphops biggest names, collabrating, its a good track, and Pac lays the nicest verses. \\"Souljahs Revenge\\" continues the hardcore pace set. \\"Strugglin\\" feat. Live Squad is one track never felt. The most upbeat track which almost seems out of place on an album that had been full hardcore to this point is \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\" this is a preview of what Pac would would be dropping on later albums, as he developed as an artist. Tupac comes across really strong and positive on this strong while talking about difficult real life problems. Would call it a Classic pac track and it would later start off his greatest hits album. \\"I get Around\\" feat. Digital Underground is one of pacs earlier tracks where he talks to the ladies, its kind of silly, but its upbeat, and relaxed. \\"Papa'z Song\\" is about growing up without a father, which was Pacs situation and many peoples situations. Very powerfull track, which is not hard to relate to when you grew up like that. \\"5 Deadly Venomz\\" feat. Apache, Treach and Live Squad closes off the album. This was one of the early albums I got, and though its not a classic like his later works, it is a really good album, and back in 93 it was one of the best. Still like to pop it today almost ten years later, and listen to a younger Pac, because even then he was starting to display the potential which made him a legend.
B0000025JT|5.0|One of Barbra Streisand's best album and a very briliant pop album. this songs are still shining today. has someone not yet heard of the song : &quot;woman in love&quot; ? Unless you hate disco, i truely recomend this LP.
B000075BFK|5.0|Tupac Shakurs latest post-death album \\"Better Dayz\\" continues the legacy of hiphops most loved MC. Another double album, twenty five tracks in total with guest appearances from well known artists like Trick Daddy, Nas, Mya, Tyrese, his crew the outlawz, Big Syke, and more appearances from less artist like T.I., B.D.I., Kimmy Hill, Nutso, A.Hamilton, Mr. Biggs, Buckshot, and BB brothers. Executive produced by Afeni Shakur and Suge Knight, some of the producers include 7 Aurelius, Johnny J, DJ Quick, BRISS & Jazze Pha. 1st single is \\"Thugz Mansion\\", second is \\"My Block\\" (remix). Recordings from this album come from the period 1994-1996, the last two years of Shakurs life. As a Pac fan who is followed him from the beginning, been waiting for this album ever since his last recording \\"Untill the end of Time\\". Album starts with raw thugged out tracks like \\"Still Balling\\", \\"When we ride on our Enemies\\", \\"F**K em all\\", classic pac emotional, angry in some cases and always entertaining. On \\"Mamas Just a Little Girl\\", Pac shows his softer side, with inspirational thought provoking music. \\"Street Fame\\" is another hardcore track, next comes \\"Fair Exchange\\" an upbeat track, where Pac talks to the ladies, \\"Late Night\\" is a laid back mellow party track. \\"Ghetto Star\\" and \\"Thugz Mansion\\" feat. Nas Acoustic close off disc one well. These 13 tracks alone could make a complete album. \\"My Block\\" (Remix) the albums second single is a track about the ghetto, and growing up poor, track is thought provoking and reflective track, one of those tracks you can replay over and over again. Next comes \\"Thugz Mansion\\" that track you will hear on the radio, produced by 7 Aurelius, another nice track. Next comes \\"Never Call U \\"B**** again\\" feat. Tyrese, nice Rap/R&B collab track. This is followed by the title track \\"Better Dayz\\" which uses Isley brother vocals, which at the moment is my favourite track. \\"There you Go\\", \\"This Life I Lead\\", \\"Who do you Believe In\\" all standout on Disc 2, and the albumis closed well with \\"They dont give a F*** about us\\". Beats, Vocals, Lyrics, and Production tight all throughout, making \\"Better Dayz\\" another classic from raps legendary MC.
B0000025HG|3.0|i expected a lot from this album, but was truely disapointed with the result. As the song &quot;enough is enough&quot; this  LP is a non-sens, they are no connections between the songs, or worse, into them.
B00005JL78|5.0|Well some people found the storyline too confusing, but after seeing this film in theaters, I was convinced it is one of the best films of the year. It's a pretty long movie with an awesome plot. The storyline keeps you guessing, and even when you think it's over, it's not. All your theories disappear once the next phase appears. It's definetly a rush, and will keep you intensed until the very end. It's the fugitive in the future. I recommend this product to it's fullest
B00006RU5B|5.0|I can't believe my ears!  What an album!  As a life long worshiper of all that is Chris Cornell I admit to being a bit concerned about how he would work with RATM but WOW this is unbelievable.  Right from the first FX riddled gtr riff on Cochise right through to the end this album pushes the boundaries of contemporary rock music. The album sounds as you would expect it too, It sounds like RATM playing the tunes and Chris in his soundgarden mode battering out the vocals. MUST BUY!
B00006NSZ5|3.0|When Eminem is placed beside another rapper, he usally steals the show. But how about when he's placed beside a Who's Who list of rappers on a soundtrack? The answer is still yes.<br />Simply, get the album for the Eminem songs because all of them are dope (well, duh). In fact, \\"8 Mile Road\\" is even better than \\"Lose Yourself\\", a song that radio will never get tired of. Other good songs are Young Zee of the Outsidaz with \\"That's My N For Real\\" and a rejuvenated 50 Cent with \\"Wanksta\\". <br />But like all soundtracks, there are a few missteps. Macy Gray gives us \\"Time of Your Life\\", an R&B song that disrupts the hip-hop feel of this album, plus she went out of style with the year 2000. Rakim's verses on \\"R.A.K.I.M.\\" are decent, but the chorus and production are both terrible. And Nas gives an uninspired performance on the sluggish \\"You Wanna Be Me\\". But it's funny that the very next song that follows is from his rival Jay-Z, who shines so bright on \\"8 Miles and Running\\" (with Freeway) that it proves my theory that Hova gives his best performances everywhere but on his own albums.<br />So, to sum it up, there are some good songs and some bad songs on this soundtrack, but the good songs make the album a little worthwhile.
0886461251|4.0|I began this book with the intent of it giving me something to read for a class assignment.. I figured i was going to dislike it very much, and just pretend to read it. The way that Heller mixes fact and comedy blows me away.  The details and descriptions of characters and places in this book are almost like watching a movie. Each character is drawn well, and very defined-- I began to feel for a few of them, and reading doesn't usually do that to me.  There were a few parts of profanity that I wasn't totally getting a feeling for, but other than that it was good, and well worth the reading. My favorite character happens to be one by the name of Major Major. It is quite the story how he got the name, which you will have to read to find out. His character stuck with me from the first introduction.  This book is about crazy people: You're crazy if you want to stay in the war. You're crazy if you want to leave, because you know you won't be able to. I definately give Heller kudos on this book, and I plan on reading more by him.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|I love the sound of old guys laying it all on the line...  this record's got that in spades.<br />Great CD and a big improvement on American III: Solitary Man, which was only half a good record.<br />Of course nothing compares to the first American Recordings for beauty and power....   Pick that up before you try this one.
B000070WJE|4.0|Robbie's fans won't be surprised that he's once again re-invented himself with a new style.  While &quot;I've Been Expecting You&quot; differed only slightly in format from &quot;Life Thru a Lens,&quot; &quot;Sing When You're Winning&quot; and &quot;Swing When You're Winning&quot; both marked extreme departures for Robbie.  Both, however, were wonderful and showed a great deal of flexibility for the singer.<br />The same can be said for &quot;Escapology.&quot;  The style is much different from any of Robbie's previous releases, but this is not a bad thing.  The album's a great listen straight through.  My only reason for giving the album four stars instead of five is that the new style is just a bit too radio-friendly for me.  Perhaps this is Robbie's continued attempt to break into the US music scene.  In any case, buy &quot;Escapology&quot; and be rewarded with something new and refreshing.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Not enough words to write about this album, except thank you for releasing these songs all of us system fans have been craving for a while now. Great cd, Only wish they could have added storaged and snowblind. Nonetheless,  If you are a SOAD fan, these unreleased songs will not dissapoint you, I promise. Great Job!!!
B00006RU5B|4.0|After a long wait, and a will-they or won't-they push and pull between band members and apparent management conflicts, Audioslave has finally released the best new album of the year.  It's not RATM.  It's not Soundgarden.  It's a blend of complementary styles.  It's something new and exciting, and it gives me faith that real rock still exists!  The record ranges in sound from hard-driving instruments and wailing vocals on &quot;Cochise&quot;, to a combination of beautiful melody, lyrics and vocals on &quot;I Am the Highway&quot;.  Add this disc to your collection -- you will not be disappointed!
B00007E8V4|4.0|If you love System Of A Down, you'll love this cd. No review needed.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Overall the series is good. One thing missing is the subtitle for the English language.
B000002P5W|5.0|After the debut,\\"Are you Experienced\\" masterpiece was released, many of us fans, when hearing of the follow-up to be soon released were apprehensive that another disc by Experience could come up to the high standards that the first achieved.  Keep in mind that this music of Jimi's was not of the world-wide acclaimed genius as it is accepted today!  Afterall, this was well before the hearing of the famous anecdotes about Jimi from other guitar-heros, ala Pete Townsend; who admitted, that he was warned by friends that this 'American' was ripping off his 'moves'!  Monterey Pop Festival (1967) hadn't happened yet and all we fans had to go from was this amazing record and a few 'in' DJ remarks that this first record by the 'American' that made his mark in England with English side-men, was something really, really, special!!!  Hearing the first record was 'earth-shattering' even when compared to the already obtained, mind blowing, \\"Fresh Cream'!!!  [Where} was this music going?  Wherever it was, I wanted to go along with it, support it, and maybe, just maybe, witness it in person!!! \\"Is it for real\\"?  \\"Can this be performed live\\"?  \\"Can you imagine seeing it live, stoned\\"? 'Mind Blowing' was never more an fitting description to \\"Are You Experienced\\". <br /><br />So, now news of a second record?  How can it compare to perfection?    The 'sophomoric' curse had bestowed its' ugly head far too many times with other artists to discount this possible scenario.  And besides, it was ramblin-jack's feeling that if Jimi and co. never made another record, then that was alright with me as \\"Are You Experienced\\", hit a mark of excellence that I felt could never be repeated.<BR><br />  So, here I am driving down to the local 'Gemco' in my '57 F-100 to buy the second (ha ha) attempt from Hendrix.<br />After paying my [$] plus tax I brought it home, and put \\"Axis: Bold As Love\\" on the turntable.  Hmm.. Great Album Title...  <br /><br />Side one was less than halfway through before I wasconvinced.  \\"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus\\"!!!  This record was not only landmark, but it was deeper than the first!!! There was more to say, Jimi and company were 'teaching us' something here.  \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\"?  Oh my God, play that one again\\"!  \\"Little Wing\\"? \\"If 6 were 9\\", whoa, wait a minute, wow, shades of \\"It's Alright Ma, I'm only Bleeding\\"!   \\"Castles Made of Sand\\"?  Unbelievable!  And the humor on this one!!!  Jimi is not only for real with his technique, but a masterful song-writer.  The record met and exceeded my expectations!  It was impossible to imagine that Jimi's Music would ever be referred to as anything short of genius!  So now we have twins, a dynamite pair of recordings that have \\"Smashed\\" into the arena of Rock Music. Can the world of Rock ever get better than this?  Well time has answered this question...
0553381709|5.0|The &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series keeps getting better. The unpredictable plot, coupled with convincingly consistent, yet complex characters and narratorial voices kept me on the edge of my proverbial seat.<br />&quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; brings Martin's artistry to new heights as he continues to make surprising twists to the plot, logically built on previous events. The fact that the narration often refers to events and conversations long past makes for a smooth and easy read that keeps you informed. Martin obviously knows exactly the power of his prose, as he uses these references to guide the reader's expectations in such a way as to surprise even the most cynical and rational reader.<br />The politics of Westeros continue to fall apart as alliances are broken and wars are won and lost. Events set up in previous books come to a head, only to leave the reader anticipating the answer of dozens more questions that the answers presented pose.<br />All in all a great read, and highly recommended to any fan of serious fantasy. Additionally, I recommend it to anybody that wants to read about cloak-and-dagger politicking that doesn't leave a cliche'd taste in the mouth.
6300267881|5.0|The Exorcist is the scariest movie ever no matter what version you see it in. I prefer &quot;THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN&quot; myself, but any version will do. I love this version. It is expertly well made. It has great acting, great plot, great story, and very scary music. This movie is a part of the unholy trinity of movies. The Exorcist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby make up this unholy trinity, so I suggest while you are here, might as well buy the unholy trinity. Like I said, doesn't matter wich version you get, but I would recommend THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN over this one, but it doesn't matter which version you see, it's still the scariest movie ever made, and don't let anyone tell you differently.
0375823360|5.0|This trilogy is definitely one to read. All the books are very fast-paced and interesting.
B0000524CY|5.0|This is the scariest movie I've seen so far. Yes it is even scarier than Psycho, Halloween, and The Shining. This is based on a true story, so there is definately nothing scarier than real life. I fully agree with Robert Larson in the fact that this is THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE! This film also is very disturbing, and has great plot, great acting, great story, and bone chilling music. This is the bench mark on which all other horror movies are scored. This will probably never be topped. Not even The Ring could top this. This is definately the scariest movie I've seen, but in order for this film to scare you, you have to take it seriously. Watch this one alone in the dark for the ultimate experience. THE EXORCIST IS THE SCARIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! IT'S NOT AN OPPINION, IT'S A FACT.
0767817648|4.0|\\"Blue Thunder\\" is an experimental police helicopter planned to keep LA safe by the time the Olympics come to town (this flick came out a year or two before the '84 Summer games).  Clothed in armour plating, boosted by powerul, turbo-charged engines, and carrying a 20MM rotary cannon in her nose, Blue Thunder is a two-man, flying SWAT team.  Muscle aside, the chopper also bristles with sophisticated surveillance gear centered around a computer that can hook into any other mainframe in America.  Though Thunder has been evaluated throroughly by the US Army, the authorities want one of LAPD's own pilots to test-fly the chopper across LA's skies.  <br />The pilot, however, is Murphy (Scheider), a burnt-out flier who drove gunships for the army in Vietnam.  After catching a dazzling demonstration of Blue Thunder's power (on a mockup town full of white and red dummies symbolizing by-standers and terrorists), Murphy learns that the army's chief test-pilot is FE Cochrane (McDowell, keeping a lot of his accent despite playing an army colonel), his commander in Vietnam, and a brutal sadist.  Cochrane aside, Murphy has other problems - mostly involving unfavorable psych evals, and a suspension resulting from their failure to support cops in the ground in a botched attempt to save the life of a controversial city politician.  Nevertheless cleared to fly the chopper, Murphy and LAPD flight observer Lymangood (Daniel Stern) fly outside their assigned plan and, using the chopper's electronic gear against its developers, learn of their darker intentions for the super chopper (without giving away anything, let's just say that this flick has some strangely prophetic ideas on the \\"Homeland Security\\" issue).  Recording proof against Blue Thunder's developers, and hoping to hold out long enough for his girlfriend to contact the media with proof that will ground Blue Thunder for good, Murphy hijacks the chopper and finds himself targeted by everybody.  Other cops and the USAF soon find their hardware isn't enough against Murphy, meaning that Cochrane himself will have to finish the job, setting the stage for an epic low-level chopper-dogfight among the city streets of LA, looking sort of like a car chase from one of those 70's cop shows, only using helicopters instead of that \\"Gran Torino\\".<br />\\"Blue Thunder\\" is an excellent movie.  The flight scenes are fantastic, the special effects are great and everything is held together by an edgy electronic score and cinematography taht highlights the story's paranoia (if you saw \\"The Insider\\", you've got the idea).  More than that is how much fun the characters have with their roles - the light banter between Stern and Scheider and Warren Oates (as Murphy's boss) keeps things going until we actually get to see the super-chopper in action.  Even then, the script builds up to Cochrane and Murphy's battle-royale, straps you in and never lets go.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When I lost RATM I seriously was at a loss musically and I did not think that the slow coming Audioslave would be up to par with RATM. And they are not...they are amazing in their own way.RATM can't be copied but nor can this cd...its amazing on a different level. I suggest if you like good music you buy this albumn now...NOW...GO NOW!!
B00006X06U|5.0|Although a life-long fan of Joni, I was skeptical about the concept of orchestral versions of her songs.  In fact, the results here are sublime.  The selection of material from her vast canon is adroit, the arrangements are very true to the spirit of the originals while adding even greater depth to their impact, and Joni's voice has never been more richly expressive.  These discs are absolutely essential for any Joni fan, and really for anyone who loves good music.
0066620996|5.0|Great concept for a study and book.<br />There are so many books ut ther on how to make yourself more successful and effective at business and the few I have tried to read just could not keep me turning the page.  Collins' book is different. The writing is crisp and clean and his anologies from the business world to personal life resonate and keep the book moving.  And because the boot is well footnoted, a lot of the details of the study (and sources) are available at the end of the reading and not scattered throughout the text, bogging it down.<br />The book reads quiker than one thinks and is well organized.  I recommend to anyone with the slightest interest in how successful businesses operate.
B00006LLJ4|3.0|I found the movie very stylish and enjoyable but the plot is based on a fundamental logical error. <br />We are to assume that the precognitions are all genuine. Then, how on earth does Max van Sydow's character generate a precognition in which Tom Cruise's character commits the murder?? <BR>The only reason TC's character even KNOWS about the victim (and hence ends up in the flat at exactly the right time) is through the precognition he sees secondhand. <br />Compare it to this: I show you a precognition of yourself walking to a park near you, digging under a particular tree, and finding a gold bar. Then sure, you may well go and look exactly there at exactly that time, since you think you may find a gold bar there if you do but ONLY because you saw the precognition. <BR>In other words, if you had not seen a precognition of yourself looking there, you would NOT have dreamt of even going to the park! Hence there could have been no precognition of this event (which would NOT have taken place).<br />The only way this could work is if the precognition is faked, which contradicts one of the important premisses of the movie.
B00006JDVV|4.0|I have to admit, I thought that this movie would ....<BR>I thought it would just be another monster movie (with dragons).<BR>I was surprised by the fact that it was actually good!<BR>The plot is actually decent, the acting is good (bale and Mcconaughey are great)and direction and special effects are top notch.<BR>   Bale and McConaughey are in top physical shape,but look much grungier than their usual \\"pretty boy\\" images.<BR>DVD is fun with cool animated windows, and decent bonus features.<BR>over all a great movie to own.
0613027825|5.0|Although Scott McCloud admittedly didn't create the book for web developers, it is a MUST READ for any serious (and not so serious) person creating a website.  \\"What happens between the frames\\" in a comic strip is very similar to what happens between clicking from one page to the next online.  What is the user thinking?  What is going through their mind?  What are they expecting to see while the next page downloads?  Are you delivering on that promise?  Are you meeting (and beating) their expectations? Plus, this book gives you a great understanding of character development and story development (both horribly missing online). I cannot recommend this book enough - plus, it is easy to read as it is entirely in comic format.
B000059T5O|5.0|John hammond has paid his dues and played with all the big dogs,<BR>like john lee hooker and muddy waters.<BR>  this album is gritty delta style blues with a muddy waters feel to it.<BR>   Tom Waits' Lyrics are like something out of an old Robert Johnson tune, Murder,The Devil,Booze, its all here.<BR>fans of oldschool blues will love this, and if you are a fan of Hammond, you'll definitely like it.<BR>a must to own!!
B00000JPYD|5.0|Unlike some of the other reviewers of this album, I feel the added &quot;live&quot; tracks ARE essential.  Any group can be great in the studio (Beatles), but to get on stage and reproduce what you've recorded, chop for chop, is the mark of a true musician, in my opinion.  These live tracks show that Robin Trower is such an accomplished musician.
B00000JPYD|4.0|people always have something negative to say about Trower , like that he was a hendrix ripoff, I think this is ridiculous.<BR>Trower was a great guitarist and deserves a spot in the list of great guitarists from the 70's.<BR> Bridge of sighs is without a doubt his best studio album.<BR>the title track is perhaps one of the best songs of its time.<BR>A little bit of sympathy is also one of the better songs on the album.<BR>     people who appreciate wild guitar licks and great musicmanship will love this album.<BR>     definitely worth owning.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Unlike the other reviews of this album, I feel the live tracks included ARE essential; as we all know, some groups (Beatles) are great in the studio, and some are great live.  Robin Trower is one of those that should be heard live, and these tracks prove without a doubt that he CAN reproduce on stage what he's recorded, chop for chop.  To me, the true test of a musician is, how good are they LIVE?
B00001OH7G|5.0|Rory Gallagher was one of the greatest guitar players who ever lived,It is a shame that his life ended so early, and also that so few people know about him.<BR>   This live recording captures the intensity of his awe inspiring ability with a guitar.<BR>   &quot;cradle Rock&quot; is a great tune with blazing fast guitar that will satisfy the most critical listener,while &quot;tattoo'd lady's<BR>catchy chorus will have you humming it all day.<BR>   If you are a fan of great guitar blues, this belongs in your collection. NO guitar player should be missing this album in their collection!
B0000028RR|5.0|Ok, Zach,Tom,Brad and Tim have alot of money,but they can still be against  the system.And the most important thing is that they care about the poor people.Rage Against The Machine are saying things that the american goverment don`t want people to talk about.Tom Morello`s guitar playing is fantastic,Zack De La Rocha raps very aggressive and Timmy C and Brad Wilk plays funky and aggressive.If you like hard rock you must buy or ...this album.
B000001F6S|5.0|Most people have only heard &quot;I'd love to change the world&quot; by Ten years after, and when you say &quot;blues&quot; in the same sentence as &quot;ten years after&quot; most people get a quizical look on their face, the simple truth is that they were a blues band that evolved into a blues/Rock band.<BR>    This live album Perfectly demonstrates this point.<BR>My personal favorites on this recording are &quot;goin home&quot;, &quot;woodchoppers ball&quot;, and &quot;I may be wrong, but I wont be wrong always&quot;.<BR>    Alvin lee's guitar playing is some of the fastest you will ever hear, especially on &quot;goin home&quot; and woodchopper's ball&quot;.<BR>    the rhythm section deserves a medal for keeping up with Lee.<BR>they are all skilled musicians and deliver some great drum and bass solos.<BR>   all together this is an album that all blues lovers and guitar players should own, and if you've only heard &quot;I'd love to change the world&quot;,you owe it to yourself to hear the best of their stuff.
B00005J4HH|5.0|This is the second best album I have got the pleasure to listen to. Only beaten by Radioheads Ok Computer. Origin of Symmetry is real space rock that you have never heard before.All the songs are alternative rock classics...
B00007E8V4|4.0|Taking in their last album, and considering this new material with the material on Toxicity, one can see why SOAD chose not to incorporate these songs into their vision for Toxicity. The level of political expression is so far above what they normally place on their albums, its evident they were looking for their pearl in the bunch to place onto the album and keep these for later. The songs here also tend to be a lot faster with a lot of heavy guitar and a quick beat, as opposed to Toxicity's sweeping differences among each track.<br />This album has some awesome songs on it. Innervision, the single they've released, A.D.D, Mr. Jack, I-E-A-I-A-I-0 are but a few. One hears the full range of talent present in the band also..from the quiet songs (Roulette, Streamline) to absolutely ripping tracks like Nuguns and Boom!. For any fan of SOAD this is a must have album, it just has too much great material on it. The new listener would be better off to partake in their first two albums before picking this one up; so that they can see the true vision SOAD had for their previous albums, and their true art.<br />Admittedly the songs ARE a little short, but thats to be expected for a collection of songs that weren't ever really meant to make it onto an album.<br />All in all an awesome album..now lets let the band get back into the studio to work on what they want to work on, or go on tour.
B000024D4R|5.0|Who was born in a house full of pain.<BR> Who was trained not to spit in the fan.<BR> Who was told what to do by the man.<BR> Who was broken by trained personnel.<BR> Who was fitted with collar and chain.<BR> Who was given a pat on the back.<BR> Who was breaking away from the pack.<BR> Who was only a stranger at home.<BR> Who was ground down in the end.<BR> Who was found dead on the phone.<BR> Who was dragged down by the stone.<br /> Great music.Great lyrics.Great album.
B000002J20|3.0|Ok, so if your a literati type your just not gonna like this. This is music that caters to SONIC verbosity rather than lyrical acumen. Yes is the polar opposite to the Velvet Underground. If you don't dig instrumental music do NOT buy this. This is music that swings for the fences, and theres nothing wrong with that...once and a while.
B000066BYE|4.0|I can`t believe that this is a album with b-sides.Here is another album that makes muse the best band in the world.The songs on Hullabaloo is not as good as the songs on Origin of Symmetry or Showbiz, but they are too good to be b-sides. If you are a fan of muse, get this album.
B000003S0F|2.0|If you want to own just one King Crimson CD, this shouldn't be the one! And even if you are an avid KC aficionado, Islands is worth skipping. <br />This album was recorded at the end of the period between the break up of the groundbreaking 'Court of the Crimson King' band and KC's new, powerful rebirth with Fripp, Bruford, and Wetton at its core. During this time Fripp was frantically trying to keep the original KC spirit alive, but its time had passed and no amount of effort could recover it. Over the course of the three albums produced in this period (In the Wake of Poseidon, Lizard, and Islands) you can hear the band struggling for identity, and progressively loosing its way. Islands is a culmination of this lost period for KC that Fripp himself recalls as, \\"a time of desperation.\\"<br />Though all the music composition on Islands is attributed to Fripp (as is also the case with In the Wake of Poseidon) none of the songs are exemplary, or even typical works. Additionally, the band lacks all of the spontaneity and improvisational vigor that characterizes any incarnation of KC at its best.<br />I suppose the die-hard KC / Fripp fanatic will feel compelled to own Islands, or even The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles, and Fripp (an absolutely awful album!), but if you have any doubts, heed them. Your money could certainly be better spent.
B00001SIES|5.0|Together with the doors, are you experienced, generation terrorist and rage against the machine is this the best debut album I have heard.
B00005JK8K|2.0|This movie is a very big let down....I couln't wait till it came out in stores, rented it and now regret doing so. It had horrible acting, horrible stunts and a horrible over all plot. It was a very big let down to what I thought it was going to be like after seeing the theatrical teasers.........
B000002H2H|5.0|Fight Fire With Fire sure does open up with a light acoustic riff, but this is one thrash-fest.  Metallica is the best of the 80's thrash metal bands, but one thing goes very unnoticed by fans of the new Metallica: Dave Mustaine.  Mustaine was booted out of this band before the release of Ride The Lightning because of arguements.  He fueled the riffs and awe-aspiring solos behind tracks like the concert favorite (and best song on this album) \\"Creeping Death\\", the haunted, freakish \\"Call of Ktulu\\", and the title track.  After Mustaine, the band continued on it's thrash fame course, while Mustaine formed Megadeth and soon ranked along with Metallica and Anthrax in the thrash Olympics.<br />   All of the history aside, this packs quite a thrash pack, with Lars Ulrich's drumming much better than on the previous album, \\"Kill 'Em All\\",  and Cliff Burton's bass standing out more than on the other Metallica discs.  One more thing about this album (despite the poor production, which hinders the vocals) is James Hetfield's singing, which sounds different than on the other albums, kind of like the singer's [voice has lowered].  This one is a true kick in the face, and no one has yet perfected the mastery on this album better, except Metallica themselves (whose subsequent \\"Master of Puppets\\" is better than this one).  If you like thrash metal and sheer guitar mastery, buy this one and you'll love it. I guarantee it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Brilliant!  This is the music hasn't been since \\"The New Yardbirds\\"!!!  Audioslave has stepped up to carry the mantle of Led Zeppelin as the one true SUPERGROUP!  Cornell's vocals bring both edge and empathy to one of the most groundbreaking rhythm sections in music history.  Having transcended the sum of their parts, Audioslave gives a nod of homage to is predecessors, Soundgarden & RageAgainstTheMachine, and forges ahead into territories previously unimagined by artist and fan alike.  Anyone who isn't moved by this album should be checked for a pulse, because this is groove beyond!
B00006M183|5.0|I gotta wonder about someone who would review this album just two days after it's released. True, there's something to say for first impressions, but one should let an album sink in a bit, especially a Pearl Jam album. Like BINAURAL, I was a bit confounded by RIOT ACT and wasn't sure if I liked all of it. It's apparent to me now how good this music is.<br />Pearl Jam deserve props for following their own muse and not sticking to a tried and true \\"Alive\\" or \\"Jeremy\\" formula. They are continuously mining new territory. And they still rock.<br />The most surprising thing here is the prominent role of new drummer Matt Cameron (formerly of Soundgarden). He has a number of songwriting credits on RIOT ACT and plays a bubbling rhythm guitar on \\"You Are,\\" one of the best songs on the album if not THE best.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is a perfect DVD for the slipknot fan. It has phenomenal video and sound quality, unbelievable that it's live. They used over 30 cameras to film this DVD and it sure does show. This DVD includes a nice 15-song set performed in London. In addition to this, it includes 5 of the 'knots music videos. One word to describe this DVD would be &quot;incredible.&quot;
B000001FFJ|2.0|But I think this album is extremely overrated. It just doesn't do much for me. Not too exiting. I dig BONE MACHINE and MULE VARIATIONS and I consider HEARTATTACK AND VINE to be quinessential Waits. But I'll only listen to \\"Downtown Train\\" and maybe one or two others before I've had it with this tedious album. Sorry if you'd prefer me to jump on the critical bandwagon, but it's my honest opinion.
B000063NPX|5.0|When I saw &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in the theater, I had a rare and magical experience:  I felt like a child again watching an enchanting Disney movie.  In fact, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; seemed even better than the Disney classics like &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; that were such a wonderful part of my childhood.  The animation is absolutely gorgeous--particularly the waltz scene, which feels incredibly three-dimensional.  The songs are beautiful, singable instant classics.<br />Despite the animated characters, I felt like I was watching an old musical.  The movie opens with a scene reminiscent of &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; with our heroine, Belle, singing on a hilltop about wanting more out of life.  The &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; scene, featuring a Lumiere (the Maurice Chevalier-inspired singing candlestick), dancing dishes and champagne corks popping like fireworks, reminded me of the Busby Berkely musical extravaganzas of the '30s.<br />A big appeal for me is that Belle is a much different heroine than the Disney princesses of my childhood.  Belle isn't looking for a man to rescue her from her life of drudgery.  She loves to read and longs for a more interesting life.  She already has the &quot;town catch,&quot; Gaston, wanting to court her, but she's having none of it.<br />Belle's escape from &quot;her provincial life&quot; begins when her father, a kooky inventor, doesn't return from his travels.  (He has sought shelter from a snow storm in a spooky enchanted castle and is being held prisoner by the Beast.)  Belle tracks down her father and, out of concern for his ailing health, takes his place in captivity.  The Beast, who has been placed under a spell, wonders if Belle might be &quot;the one&quot;--the young woman whose love will return him to his original human form.<br />The enchanted furniture, candlestick, clock and dishes added lots of fun characters to the traditional story.  Cogsworth, a stuffy clock, andLumiere, the match-making candlestick are a great comic duo.  Cogsworth's romantic advice to Beast about wooing Belle is especially funny:  Give her &quot;flowers, chocolates, promises you don't intend to keep.&quot;<br />Gaston, meanwhile, wants to woo and wed Belle himself.  He sings about his he-man attributes in one of the funniest ode to a redneck that I've ever heard:  &quot;I use antlers in all of my decorating,&quot; Gaston sings about himself.<br />When Gaston realizes that Belle loves the Beast instead of him, he stirs up an angry mob to head to the castle.  In another twist on the traditional fairy tale ending, Belle ultimately rescues the Beast--not the other way around.<br />&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is a delightful classic whether you are a child or a grownup who knows how to feel like a child at times.
B000067CPX|4.0|This album isn't as immediately appealing or as energetic overall as the three albums that came before this (their best ones). The guitar work is very good, such as on the sparkling \\"Dosed.\\" \\"By the Way\\" is pretty funky, but Keidis quickly wears out the words: \\"Standing in line to see the show tonight . . .\\" \\"Throw Away Your Television\\" has a great bass line. \\"Cabron\\" and, to an extent, \\"On Mercury\\" are nice Spanish-flavoured tunes. \\"Tear\\" and \\"Warm Tape\\" include synth passages (along with other songs) and are 2 of the best in this set. Perhaps the best cut is \\"Venice Queen,\\" a song that evolves into different song like another album closer, \\"Transcending\\" from ONE HOT MINUTE (probably my favorite Chili record).<br />I don't know, this album just doesn't blow me away like their earlier stuff.  It's often subdued, though somewhat psychedelic, and less funky than what we've come to expect from the Peppers. Maybe we shouldn't hold it against them for doing something somewhat different. They should've found a better album cover though. Uugh.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The new Audioslave cd is the most amazing and original cd released in the last 10 years. It is one of the few cds you can put in and listen to 14 straight awesome songs. Chris, Tom, Tim, and Brad are the perfect combination. Chris is back to peeling paint off walls with the best voice in rock history while Tom, Tim, and Brad are back to hitting you with that hard nasty sound only they can bring. You will love this cd if you are a fan of Soundgarden, Rage Against The Machine, or just in your face incredible rock. I totally recommend it. Check it out.
B000069CWE|2.0|I was extremly impressed with \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and was impationtly wating for this Release. I got it the first day it came out at 10 am. Needless to say I wasn't to pleased. <BR>Mike Shinoda, who did the whole thing, screwed it up. Hyrbrid Theory came out with screaming, good guitars, and GOOD MUSIC. Then the remixes came out and most of them are either to \\"Rappy\\" or \\"Techonoy\\" or something. The hard-rocking Forgotten was turned into a slow techno rap song. In the End was runined. And there was only 4 songs I was pleased with, \\"with you remix\\" \\"one step closer remix\\" \\"crawling remix\\" and \\"cure for the itch remix\\".     I recomend it for anyone whos a fan of techno or rap. Head Bangers will haft to wait for their next album.
B000075BFK|5.0|Words cannot describe how good this album is, compared to all the hyped nonsense of pop music out now. It will make you think do to the fact that it is a very deep album. No album ever released can compare to the energy of this album, it is a must for any fan of Hip Hop or great music with substance. Not since 2Pac's, 'Me Against The World' album has there been a hip-hop album with such deepness and truthfulness as this one. A five star album hands down!<br />This 2Pac album is worth the money, so do not wait, get it now.
B00005A0RI|5.0|Charlie Haden is one of my favorite musicians ever. His ability to improvise from so deep in his heart and say so much with just a couple of notes is simply amazing. I have heard people say (including musicians) that Charlie is not so good. What they mean is that he's not impressive, because he doesn't show technical virtuosity on the bass. I am a bass player, and yes, I could sit down and learn a Haden solo in 10 minutes. But that is not the point. The point is he IMPROVISED IT - He came up with a beautifully melodic and evocative solo in the spur of the moment, and therein lies the true artistry. This CD is a breathtaking collection of Latin American boleros, used as the springboard for the most evocative, sublime and beautiful playing that you could get anywhere. Gonzalo is an absolute genius, and Federico Britos' violin playing is simply marvelous. I feel elevated when I listen to this!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is really more of an adult movie than a kiddy-flick. Although I didn't see anything that a child *shouldn't* see, other than the incredible animation &amp; a hilarious donkey, I'm not sure how much is in it for kids. Most of the humor would (at least I hope) be above their heads. But, for adults, there is never-ending humor and every time I watch it, I catch something I've missed before. I absolutely LOVE this movie. Mike Myers &amp; John Lithgow are great but Eddie Murphy rocks as the donkey....by far the funniest character in this movie...but he's supposed to be.<br />Please, please, please let there be a Shrek sequel!
0385508417|1.0|Sorry, John.  You wrote such an unredeemable character that I could never begin to root for him.  Luther (and his family) is so far above it all that one hopes it all comes crashing down.  He &quot;disses&quot; everyone from his secretary to his neighbors to the police to the firefighters ... even Scrooge had respect for hard-working people! Then, in the end, sure enough he chickens out.  What a coward!  And in the last chapter it is revealed, &quot;Luther hates cats.&quot;  Now, there's a surprise!
B00005QZWI|5.0|Exactly like previous reviewers said. It is a pity that such a beautiful melody is absent in 99% of the soundtrack and only present as a brief orchestrated passage towards the end of the CD. I hope that The Two Towers CD fixes that... or that another version with more music from the movies (like in Braveheart BSO) appears... Actually, I came to check this page in search of that missing piece... Other than that, an awesome achievemt. Highly recommended. As gorgeous as the movie itself.
B000066NW0|5.0|They say she's not PUNK enough, and sounds like Alanis, and should not even be near a music studio.  BUT I SAY THAT AVRIL ROCKS!... And please stop comparing her to that dumb girl Britney Spears who doesn't even know how to sing at all.  I say Avril is BETTER than Britney.  True to her words, she is 'anything but ordinary' compared to that bland blond Britney.  Buy the album by all means.
0790743213|5.0|This movie, given three Academy Awards in 1959, was one of the best Hitchcock suspense movies, with great chases and wonderful settings for Cary Grant's spying.  <br />Besides the fact that it is a great movie, Hitchcock was faced with a difficult decision of choosing Gregory Peck or Cary Grant for the role, and I think he made the right decision, because he had the unique style of choosing.  I was glad at his choice and everything else Hitchcock did, because he was the one that allowed this movie to get three Academy Awards.  <br />So, I hope you enjoy this all.
0688156819|5.0|This is a great collection of morbid, twisted little tales.  If you are  one for dark humour, this is for you.  This is in the same vein as Gorey, though often not quite so dreary.  Highly recommended in this genre.  Brief but satisfying sick humour fun.
B000066NW0|5.0|This album is definatly one of my favorite ones. I bought this CD a few months ago and it's rarely left my player! Avril has actual talent and for an 18 year old (16 when she wrote most of these songs) she has some great lyrics, on top of that the music behind the words rock also! There are no bad songs on this album they all are just fantastic, you wont find yourself skipping over any songs hardly at all! Its refreshing to see artists like Avril, Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton who actually have some talent and can write their own songs getting more and more airplay over wannabes like Brittney.
B000075BFK|5.0|Like always 2pac's lyrics are penetrating...he touches on every aspect of life through each and everyone one of his works, and Better Dayz is no different.  I must say, this album really does do justice to his legacy.  And of course you can't go wrong with one of the greatest Pac/Outlawz songs: They Don't Give A F*** About Us, on an album.  This album is a must buy, if you want to get away from all the commercial bs out there right now...what more can I say, 2pac is and will always be the GOAT.
B00006LFGD|1.0|When was the last time Streisand actually got in the studio and recorded a new album?  It is sad to see a once-stellar artist in such decline.  Everything she releases lately has been released before.  She adds a couple of new tracks and depends on her loyal fan base to buy it up.  No thank you.  Barbra, please get in the studio and give us something new.
B000002AZ8|4.0|&quot;Vitalogy&quot; is not my favorite Pearl Jam album but &quot;Immortality&quot;, which was not written for Kurt Cobain, is probably one of their best songs (the best one ???); and I love &quot;betterman&quot; as well. Nevertheless, if you are new to P.J you should own &quot;Ten&quot; before that one.
B00003OSTV|5.0|Picking up not long after I, CLAUDIUS leaves off, this film puts us in the latter epoch of the rule of Nero.  Peter Ustinov's memorable portrayal of the eccentric (and probably downright mad) emperor is how most of us picture him these days.  In fact, Ustinov might be the #1 reason people should buy this epic.<br />The story depicts the plight of the early Christians.  It is true that they were persecuted and tormented after Nero blamed them for the great fire of Rome.  The film tends to be pro-Christian and anti-Roman, but it does do a good job of presenting a few notable Romans as just and virtuous.<br />Of course, in this day & age non-Christians are not so prone to feel sympathetic with these early practitioners of the religion.  After all, by far & away more Pagans and Muslims were killed by Christians during the Crusades than Christians killed by Pagans / Romans (not to mention all of the Protestants burnt @ the stake by the Catholics).  That is even including the genocide under the reign of Diocletion.<br />That said, there is a broader message that lies in this movie, and that is the tendency towards cruelty and violence that has haunted man since the beginning, religion & politics or not.  The film does an agreeable job of detailing this facet of human existence, and it's something that even the greatest cynics can't help but appreciate.<br />The single best aspect of QUO VADIS? is that it takes us back to ancient Rome.  The sets are lavish & spectacular.  The representations of the Roman bathing rituals and victorious TRIUMPHS are exceptionally accurate.  We also get to observe the likes of the orator Seneca, the apostle Paul, the Praetorian guard leader Tigellinus and the future emperors Nerva and Galba.  Wonderfull stuff!<br />Aside from Ustinov, most of the rest of the acting is stilted.  As far as the all-important \\"screen-presence\\" goes, Robert Taylor scores a resounding zero.  He over-acts his part & displays no dynamic at all.  All of his lines come out in almost the exact same tenor, and he tends to talk too fast.<br />Despite the less-than-stellar acting, I would highly recommend this film to all persons who are even remotely interested in Roman and / or Christian history.  Here is a film that will take you on a journey thru the ages and will drop you off @ the Year of Four Emperors.come out in almost the exact same tenor, and he tends to talk too fast.<br />Despite the less-than-stellar acting, I would highly recommend this film to all persons who are even remotely interested in Roman and / or Christian history.

B00006LFGD|5.0|Josh Groban and Barbra is doesnt get any better than this!
B00006IU73|5.0|I read a reveiw of Porkupine tree on Amazon a while ago. The reveiwer said that the band has been threatoning to write a fantastic almum for ages but never quite got there. Well here it is.  Why this band is not mainstream I will never know. <BR>Buy it.<BR>Listen to it.<BR>Love it.<BR>Go.<BR>Now.
B000001E3V|4.0|There is no question that this was a supercharged band when they performed at the Fillmore East on October 23 & 24th of 1970.  They had helped George Harrison with his classic All Things Must Pass, jammed with the Allman Brothers and recorded a scortching double album with Duane Allman.  Plus there were all those drugs...<br />Simply put, if you like Clapton the blues/rock guitar player, this album will offer endless delights.  He is, truly, at the top of his form, backed by a fiery rhythm section, who seem to have a special empathy for Clapton's every turn of phrase (and vice versa).....<br />BUT, and this is a big but, something went awry when they put this expanded and changed edition together.  Evidently, this was remixed from the original multitracks, and, in this case, I believe it's true, because the sound, compared to the original L.P., is lifeless and flat.  I have no idea how this could have happened.  I still remember when I bought the original L.P. and put it on for the first time, I was amazed at the clarity and electricity of the sound.  I thought live albums were supposed to sound tough, but with this album I felt like I was standing onstage with the band, with an unbelievable crispness and warmness.<br />Because of the wondrous sound and spirited performances, this has remained one of my all-time favorite live albums.  So imagine my excitment when I discovered that a remixed expanded edition was being released.  I couldn't imagine how good this would sound.  I remember exitedly taking it home and putting it on.  But it not only didn't floor me, it just sounded sterile.  I thought my mind (and ears) were playing tricks on me, so I pulled out my old album for a critical comparison.  Sure enough, the album blew the CD away.<br />I'm not one of those who claim that good old analog is better than digital, I've heard too many digital remasters that were beautifully done and blow the analog version away to believe that.  But there are cases where, for whatever reason, the L.P. does beat the CD.  Now, I never bought the gold disc version of the original album (wish I had); I'd assume that Mobile Fidelity did it right.  But whoever Jay Mark is (remix engineer), he misses the mark, badly, on this release.  <br />Again, this is not only one of the great live albums, this is Clapton at his pinnacle of guitar playing.  If your serious about experiencing this great album, I'd recommend seeking out the original double L.P. or finding the gold disc.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|To me rajaz is the best camel cd they've done but this cd comes  very close,  since buying this cd a couple of months ago,  this music gets better and better, just like Rajaz.  To me camel have matured very nicely and because certain members of the band have changed,  they have still kept there style and still very much camel.  Certain groups out there have never managed to acheive this.  There music tells a story, so each cd from camel is completely different.  Nod and a Wink,  have gone one step further with Andrew Latimer playing more of the flute.  One track which may get certain mixed opinions is Foxhill,  sounding like genesis,  with either Caravan or Stackridge style of english lyrics or wit.  I quite like this track,  but some may find this not very camelish.  A similar track comes from Camel's Breathless cd, Down on the Farm,  which sounds very similar.<br />To me this cd is well produced and instrumently excellent with plenty of variety. Andrew has done very well on this cd and strong performances from Colin Bass and Guy Leblanc on keybourds.<BR>To Camel fans who have not heard this cd, will not be dissapointed.  To people who have a couple of camel cds who wish to add to there collection,  it is a must to have.<br />I can only conclude in my opinion,  this cd shows the maturity that Camel have become,  which is one of the best progressive rock bands of today keeping their style of music alive.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Amazing album considering the factors, BEST GUITAR PLAYER ever Tom Morello uses his amazing talent to kik all A$$, along with chris cornells powerful vioce(i was very upset at the Letterman show) finds its way to your ear and infiltrates. i only wish that everybody had a copy.
B00000ILDF|1.0|I remember seeing the first of the trailers for the third Alien movie, known as Alien 3 in movie theaters.  I could not wait to see this movie when it came out.  Boy, was I disappointed.  This movie is uninspiring, boring, and just plain depressing.  The end of the film has an ending from another film that I won't mention here that looks like it was pasted onto it, because the writer and director didn't know how to end the film.  <br />The great continuity that exists between the first and second alien films is completely lacking in this third installment.  David Fincher should stick to directing music videos.  The logical idea for a third alien film would have been to find the true homeworld where the aliens came from which hasn't been addressed in any of the four alien films.  The theme of corporate greed over human safety and Ripley's survivor instinct is forgotten in this film, which makes it an imposter of a movie.<br />I own the DVD of this movie, but the medium does not provide much, unless you're interested in seeing this movie in French.
B00006F2TV|5.0|This was a pretty good movie.  I never really got into the comic book scene and I wasn't interested at all in seeing Spiderman.  I'm pretty happy that I did see it though.  The movie was great.  The acting and storyline were especially good.  This movie is full of suspense, action and even a bit of romance.  Even if you're not a Spiderman fan, I'm sure you like this movie.
B000050FEN|1.0|I've seen my share of graphically violent films.  Some have artistic merit and some don't, but Seven is the most disturbing movie that I ever saw.  I would never see this movie again, and I would recommend to those who haven't seen it not to see it.  <br />Director David Fincher is a disturbed man, and you can tell that he REALLY doesn't like his characters in this movie.  I don't know how anyone could come away from this movie feeling good having seen it.  This movie does not deserve a rating from me (I gave it one star only because I had to), only a warning not to see it.
076781326X|5.0|My kids watch this every other month, I can't believe the depth of the performances, I see something new on each viewing.  I don't own too many movies that I don't tire of viewing, and this is one of them.  The score is magnificent, and the extra material is interesting for one viewing anyway.
B00005MAM2|4.0|Akira was, although a bit confusing, an altogether amazing film.  Though some of the characters could have used a little more depth, I realize that it was trying to focus on Tetsuo and Kaneda, the two main characters.  I loved Tetsuo's power corruption, I thought it was very well displayed and brought upon(though the large, walking toys scared the pee out of me).  Frighteningly deep, mixed with realism and dark overtones, this movie is excellent for those who love to ponder the meaning of life.
0790731452|1.0|I am writing this review long after actually watching this movie but the long lasting impression is undying.  This movie is horrible, throughout the movie I did not know whether to laugh or cry.  Laugh at the fact that this movie was actually made or cry because I had wasted... on renting it.  At no point during this two and half hours did I find the humor (a term I use loosely) the least bit interesting.  The humor was just not funny and although it was a spoof the plot was still ridiculous. It is sad to see such a wonderful ensemble cast just be thrown away on such an unfunny script.  I do not recommend this to anyone not even someone with an extremely dry sense of humor.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Magic, magic, magic, oh my!  A delightful transport to the wonderful new world created by Ms. Rowlings.  Thank her and the movie producers and stars for simply marvelous entertainment for a couple of hours.  Earnestly awaiting book #5, and can't wait until &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; comes out on DVD.
B00006LFGD|3.0|Being a long time Streisand fan, like quite a few others I have almost all the cuts on this album already, obviously apart from the two new tracks. I am a little dissapointed that for Barbra's 4oth anniversary with Columbia a little more thought could have gone into the selection and packaging.<BR>Columbia's other 2oo2 release &quot;The Essential&quot; had most of these duets already and it seems a little soon to bring them out again. Instead of the Manilow track it would have been great if she could have reteamed with Gibb and/or Diamond for just a one-off collaboration? The album graphics also leave something to be desired...the same photo of Barbra with Barry Gibb, twice?? Why not use some rare outake shots from the &quot;Guilty&quot; and &quot;No More Tears&quot; sessions. I understand that Warner Brothers will not allow Josh Groban's name to be used in conjunction with the publicity for the album, but they wouldn't allow a photograph of him with Streisand either?<BR>Thankfully the mastering is better than that on &quot;The Essential&quot; and it does come up with one gem that people may not be familiar with : the stunning version of &quot;One Less Bell To Answer/A House Is Not A Home&quot;, a duet with herself from the underrated &quot;Barbra Joan Streisand&quot; album.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I think this cd is great. You can hear a lot more middle-eastern influences in this album. Lots of these songs are incredibly quick and are over befire you even know whats goin on. You can tell that this cd was a compilation of unreleased tracks (that's not a bad thing).  buy this album. If you've heard \\"innervision\\" on the radio, you havn't heard anything. There are much better songs on this album. (A.D.D) This CD is the absolute definition of PURE ROCK FURY.
B00006RU5B|5.0|What was once thought to be 'Civilian' and then thought to break up, canceling shows in the U.S., has now formed into Audioslave. The remaining members of Rage Against the Machine and the lead singer from Soundgarden have combined forces to create a new, original and fantastic sound. The lyrics are loud, and the guitar work of Tom Morello are still amazing. Not to mention a still awesome Brad Wilk on drums with the combination of bassist Tim Commerford. Any Rage/Soundgarden or metal/alternative fan will love this cd!
B00006RU5B|4.0|I think this album has a great sound.  it is so cool that the Rage guys and Chris Cornell hooked up to form Audioslave.  With their successful musical backgrounds, the band will certainly produce great stuff and a huge fan following.  The song Cochise is just awesome!
B00005JL96|4.0|I loved this movie so much that when it came to the theater i work at i went to see it 8 times. one of those times i took my<BR>mother and grandparents. they loved it almost as much as i did.<BR>i cant wait for it come out on dvd!
B000075BFK|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST RAP ALBUM OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IS ONE OF 2PAC GREATEST POSTHUMUS ALBUM AFTER HIS DEAD MOST OF THE SONGS ARE GOOD OUT OF 26 SONGS 3 OF THEM ARE OK THE REST ARE GREAT SONGS BUT THEN AGAIN IS 2PAC WHAT COULD YOU EXPECT RIGHT FROM THE GREATEST RAPPER.THIS ALBUM IS WORTH EVERY PENNY. SO BUY IT YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED AND SUPPORT AND SHOW LOVE FOR PAC.<br />R.I.P. UNTIL 2003
B00006BTCA|5.0|Well, I saw Interpol in concert a few months back and was mesmerized by their sound. I immediately thought of Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, Bauhaus and My Bloody Valentine, all in one band. I strongly recommend this album, I got it after the show and just can't get enough of it. Later, a friend said to me &quot;it is a musical past back in a new form.&quot; I'd rather think of it as music in its best form.
B00007E8V4|5.0|When an album of just old stuff and unreleased material can be this AWESOME.  What more can be said.  These are the most four talented guys in the music industry today.  It is addictive to say the least.  Track 8 might be there best yet.  But the whole CD just is simply put 'A Work of Genius'.  I cannot wait for their next studio album.  Not since the Beatles has a band come together in such perfection with such socially seering lyrics. We would be wise to listen to their message and respond in a positive way.  Listen or we may all be in the true System of a Down soon.  ROCK ON!!!
0030839939|5.0|The books, despite being older than me, is still THE text book in solid state (same way as Led Zep is king of classical rock). Comprehensive, NO look-up-in-the-text kind of problems and thorough. People always wonder why there is no second edition of this book, simply because there isn't a single book which can meet its high standard.<br />Apart from that, you need a good teacher to teach this book. I took course in advanced solid state and used the same book, didn't even had a feeling of k-space. But later was blessed to take the course again with Aschroft. Not only he is an excellent researcher, but extra-ordinary teacher. Rediscovering solid state again was fulfilling with one of the best teacher and one of the best book to follow.
B00000JMQE|5.0|The thing with this movie is YOU CAN'T COMPARE IT TO THE JUDY GARLAND CLASSIC.To me this wasn't ment as a sequel to the 1939 version.If people would stop comparing it to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; I mean don't get  wrong The Wizard of Oz is my FAVORITE  movie but this movie makes it seem that OZ is more real.This movie is MUCH more scarier to the Judy Garland Dorothy.Sit down and watch this DVD but DO NOT I REAPT DO NOT COMPARE IT TO THE WIZARD OF OZ.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Combinacin explosiva la de Cornell y los de RATM, con este proyecto dan un buen ejemplo de que hay mucho rock por delante
B00006RU5B|5.0|This CD is everything its cracked up to be. it is rage against the machine for people who are fans of soundgarden. Chris Cornells voice works so well on top of the amazing guitar from Tom Morello. This album gives tom morello the little push he needed to get himself know has one of if not the best guitarists of the last 10 years. it doesnt matter wether you prefer rage or soundgarden when you buy this cd you will not be disappointed.
0385484518|5.0|I received &quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; much sooner than expected and in good condition.  It is a wonderful book!!  I highly recommend it to everyone but, especially to all men. It is one<BR>of the best books written about men getting in touch with their<BR>&quot;softer side&quot; and about not being afraid to show their feelings.<BR>Beautifully written!
B00007E8V4|5.0|This blow me away!!!!! As all know this is the songs that were left out for the album \\"Toxicity\\". Well i think probably this cd is cooler than Toxicity. When u think of Shavos dark bass sound, Darons groovy guitar sound, Johns rythm drums and Serjs vocals (ohhh my odin...) this probably one of the greatest bands out there now days. If u liker this one then u should check out Their self-titled album, Toxicity and some of mudvaynes releases. Please go buy it. Ur doing yourself a big favour.
B0000508U6|5.0|i recently got around to buying both &quot;a rush of blood to the head&quot; and &quot;parachutes&quot;.  both of these albums are just astounding.  &quot;parachutes&quot; is brilliant, touching, and endearing.  i am currently really into track 9, we never change.  not only is chris martin's voice very emotional, the music itself is subtle but nearly hypnotic.  this album, also, has that certain british sound that you can't quite explain but you know when you hear it.  i guess that is why coldplay gets the radiohead comparisions...<br />bottom line, i love this album because it obviously came straight out of this band's heart and soul.  and that is what makes wonderful music, as far as i am concerned!
B00006JDVV|3.0|The whole premise for this movie is cool.  The old legends were true--there WERE dragons back in Midieval days.  They also killed the dinosaurs, brought on the ice age with their ash, and starved themselves into hibernation.  Then one day some engineers dug too deep (as engineers always do in these kinds of movies) and the whole world went to pot.  <br />Cool concept, huh?  Too bad there wasn't much beyond that.  I was ready and rarin' for lots of action, but there was very little, and it was sporadic and not even that great.  The plot is okay, not very original, and was pretty entertaining for one viewing.  I don't know if I could sit through it again, though.<br />In short, this is one of those movies that looked really cool but proved to be a let-down.  My advice?  Watch it once (if you like this kind of movie) before you decide to buy.  I know I won't be owning this one.
B00000260F|2.0|This is a by far Beck's worst album. Made in the mid-80's this music is combined with too much synthesizers and not enough of Beck's guitar. <BR>The vocals range from sub-par to poor.<BR>I gave it two stars for the tracks &quot;People Get Ready&quot; with Rod Stewart on vocals and the other &quot;Ambitious&quot; the only two tracks that actually show off Beck's trademark licks.<BR>Pass on this cd.
B00006RU5B|5.0|As a huge Soundgarden/Chris Cornell Fan i have been eagerly awaiting this album. Although when i first heard about the Cornell/Rage collaboration i was very unsure how it was going to 'work' with Soundgarden and Rage having two excellent but completely different sounds. My first reaction on listening to the album was ...WOW!!!<BR>Morello and the boys have still got the trademark Rage funky riffs but Chris' influence has mellowed and 'chilled out' the sound. Chris' vocals and lyrics are as fantastic as ever, and i love the fact that they have included a few 'Euphoria Morning' type tracks. Not only does Chris's voice send shivers down the spine, but i think it's given Morello, Wilk, and Commerford a chance to create a more chilled out and relaxed sound.   <BR>The Other tracks (Cohise, Set it Off and Gasoline to name a few) are also amazing. It's hard to describe but it is like Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine have been split down the middle and joined together... in a way that has enabled them to create a totally new raw, funky, soul-type grungy sound that incorporates the best of both Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine.<BR>This is a fantastic album, one of the best this year, by far and is a must for any Soundgarden/Cornell/Rage fan... or any other fans of such highly skilled musicians/lyricists as these guys.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!
B000070WJE|4.0|The fact that Robbie Williams is a relative unknown in the United States is not only unfortunate, its downright criminal.  After \\"Sing when you're Winning\\" featured some weaker songs than we heard in \\"Ego\\", Robbie returns with a more mature album that features many different styles of music. Robbie rocks hard in \\"Song 3\\", mellows out in softer tunes such as \\"Sexed up\\" and shows off the LA lifestyle he's been living in \\"Hot fudge\\".  If you're a fan of many diverse types of music, you can't ask for anything more than this. Robbie mixes alternative, rock, and brit pop music onto one album. This CD is a winner all the way, and hopefully will finally be recognized by Americans.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is the best 2pac album i've got. I really feel for the struggle he was going through. I am proud of his abition and profession in his artistic music. This album has wicked tracks  all of them are good, especially Holla at me, Life goes on, I ain't mad at cha and Check out time.He is truly a legend and you know biggy is not as good as him, R.I.P Tupac amuru Shakur
B00006LLNU|5.0|( ) comes with no song titles, no lyrics, no mention of band members or the instruments they play. There are vocals, but no actual words. There are no production credits. There are only blank pages with the faint image of haggard tree branches and bushes. The intention of this approach is to strip the focus away from everything but the music.<br />The band's previous album, _Agaetis Byrjun_, was a more accessible and upfront work with lush orchestrations.

The music is the inkwell, but the listener is the poet, scribing one's own fable to Sigur Ros' winter phantasmagoria. From the time when Play is pushed onward, the world evaporates into a monochromatic vista that slowly billows over the real world. The frosty tone of the music is as visceral as winter's listless sigh, but it is not an unpleasant cold -- it is more like a warming chill from a lover's breath across bare skin, or a sip of searing coffee after a long time out in the cold. (Dallis Bros., not Starbucks.) The vocals are radiant, wordless in a manner recalling the Cocteau Twins -- a ghostly, androgynous falsetto that could make every withered tendril on the snowy canvass flourish with vitality. Songs build and shift with at a glacial pace, and yet everything seems to end far too quickly.<br />I can't discuss individual tracks because I've never paid attention to where one ends and one begins. The album is split into two parts, each four tracks long. To me, the ( represents the hopeful and heartening side, replete with beautiful pianos, each note evoking the crystalline tears shed at a hero's funeral, at once elegiac and uplifting.

6305736650|5.0|I've seen people attempt to put into words how great this film is, and none of them had ever come close.  I'm certainly not about to start...<br />Casablanca is a must own.  You'll be proud of it.
0553502271|4.0|The Testament is a surprisingly decent if somewhat prosaic novel by the ever-popular John Grisham.  To his credit the author breaks away, if only slightly, from his proven yet over-exercised formula of legal dramas.  The Testament branches out into areas of morality, religion and greed.  On balance the author succeeeds in capturing the reader's attention.  I liked the book despite myself.<br />The beginning of the story starts off very well. The death of a multi-billionaire/monster is eagerly awaited by his completely dysfunctional children and ex-wifes.  The rich geezer is looking go to the hereafter with his malicious streak intact.  After his death a legal battle takes place, and the hunt for the man's illegitimate daughter ensues.  The trail soon leads to the jungles of Brazil (think snakes, bugs, disease).  Okay so far.<br />But then one of the lawyers becomes wrapped up with this daughter's belief in God, her self-sacrificing existence, and within a matter of days his entire life, albeit a pretty miserable life, is reformed.  Contrived?  Yes.  Does it ruin the book?  No, not especially.  But such life-transforming dramas are best left to more talented writers than Grisham.  And the entire adventure in the wilds of Brazil was surprisingly well done.  Perhaps Grisham should write adventure stories instead of going for the deep, human values stuff?<br />Bottom line: an enjoyable if uneven novel.  Grisham fans will not be impressed.  All others should find it entertaining.
B000070WJE|5.0|This is Robbie William's most ambitious and cohesive release to date.  No wonder he has been signed to one of the biggest deals in UK history!  He covers lots of subjects.....fame, love, society, etc....he is in fine voice....emotional at one point and full of grit on another.....lots of great band work also...lots of funky beats, fast rockers....a pleasant release for anyone who likes great music!
B00006RU5B|5.0|For Soundgarden fans, this album has great new songs showcasing Cornell's signature style, while at the same time pleasing die-hard Rage Against the Machine fans with full-on rockitude.  Tom Morello's riffs in \\"Gasoline\\" and \\"Shadow of the Sun\\" are spactacular, and don't forget the now famous \\"Cochise\\" track, a great blend of Cornell and Rage.  <br />     With a good mix of hard rock (\\"Cochise\\", \\"Gasoline\\", \\"Set it off\\") and bluesy ballad-esque songs like \\"Getaway Car\\" and \\"The Last Remaining Light\\", this album is sure to please!
B000065V41|4.0|Released in 1992 'The Muppet Christmas Carol' is a TRUE CLASSIC.  Brian Henson directs a true masterpiece, a great tribute to the genius of his father.  The Muppet Christmas Carol remains astonishingly true to the Dickens classic.  Michael Caine delivers a fantastic performance as Ebeneezer Scrooge, the mizerly, bitter old man who's anger at Christmas and all it encompasses touches everyone around him.  On Christmas Eve Scrooge is visited by three spirits who show him the true meaning of Christmas.  With Kermit as Cratchet and Miss Piggy as his wife and the ensemble cast of the Muppets filling all the other pertinent roles this is a fabulous film for the entire family.  There is something for everyone in this wonderful, magical film.  With the exception of 'The Muppet Movie' the 'Muppet Christmas Carol' is probably one of the most spectacular muppet movies to come out of the Henson studios.  I am dissapointed that this film is not widescreen, however, you cannot miss this opportunity to own a great film which will enrich your life and those around you.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series tells the story of one company, Easy Company, from the first few days of trainging through the end of WWII in a powerful and real manner.  This story has a way of bringing you into the story and helping you understand what the young men of this era went through to save the world.  You'll laugh, cry and gain a humble respect for the men and women of this era.<br />Thank you to Spielberg and Hanks for doing this.  Thank you to Ambrose for working with the real men, who served in WWII with Easy.  I wish I could shake every man's hand and just tell them thank you for giving their heart, soul and life towards Easy's effort.<br />Everyone should see this series.
B00006RU5B|5.0|To all of those RATM fans out there and to everyone else I have only one thing to say... BUY THIS CD! This album has the power of Rage but introduces a new, more mellow sound that fits perfectly with Cornell's voice. I have been a Rage fan for a long time and wasn't too pleased with the idea of a new band but after hearing the album I am glad that Chris and the guys have gotten together. Also, this is a cd that is worth BUYING and not downloading as it is packed with extra features. Overall this had been a great step for the musicians involved and I hope they keep it up.
B00003BDXG|4.0|I must say this movie is great.  The movie starts off a little slow but once it gets started it keeps on going.  The movie does glorify the concept of violence.  It also explains to us that sometimes society feels the need to explain violence.  This is explored in the short lasted TV interview toward the end of the film(I will leave it a surprise).  This movie follows two killers through their rampage across country.  The duo can be compared to Bonnie and Clyde in many ways.  I gave the movie a four because it is hard to get into.  I must say I tried to watch it several times before I was actually able to watch the whole thing.  For anyone who buys it, stick with it and you'll get into.  I know I did.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I just want to say that if you like rock then you should buy this cd. The cd is packed with melodic powerful music and tons of bonus features that no fan wants to miss. If you are a Rage or a Soundgarden fan then you will love this. Rock on guys!
0380002930|5.0|I must first praise Richard Adams for the complete originality of this book.  Adams introduces you to the rabbit culture telling you of their stories and the way in which they live.  When a rabbit warren is in danger some flee to find a new home and other wait for impending doom.  I have read this book twice in my lifetime and it still amazes me, it gives you the feeling of courage.  You can tell by reading this book Adams has done his homework on the lives of wild animals.  When our teacher first told us of this book I thought I would hate it.  With no humans in the book (or only briefly mentioned) I thought it would be hard to relate to the characters(the rabbits).  Adams does a fine job of bringing rabbits up to our level.
6304118406|1.0|This film is clearly a directors attempt to take full creative license at the expense of the paying customer. I hope Stone has gotten this woe-begone attempt at artful representation out of his system... If a director wished to make an artistic comment, would choosing the so-called story of two gratuitous pathelogical murderers be the proper vehicle? This perhaps would've worked in the 60's, but lets get with the times Mr. Stone...and STOP wasting my time...chump!!
B000066NW0|5.0|Ok, like all the reviews I read for this had people who were complaining about whether or not this girl is a punk or not (most of them said not)  Personally I don't think she is and I think she is just as fake as anyone in the industry.  But, that isn't the question.  The question is \\"was the cd good?\\"  I think that while she may not be a punk the cd was really good, and I loved almost all of the songs.
0375707972|5.0|This is not a fun book, and there is no happy or easy resolution. It is also carefully structured to establish the dilemma of postwar Germany coming to terms with the Nazis. The main character is symbolic of Germany. He falls ill and is saved by a mysterious woman, Hanna. He returns to thank her and is both attracted and terrified of her. They become lovers and he struggles to manage Hanna's swings from sensual caring to vicious cruelty. She then vanishes and he moves on with his life, only for her to reappear as a former Nazi on trial for war crimes. He struggles to come to terms with this, but in fact never really does. The trial exposes the corruption and hypocrisy of the accusers, whose self-righteousness conceals their own complicity. Finally, many years later he must deal with her continued existence and his inability to come to terms with their shared past.<br />This is a difficult and thought provoking book. Literally very simple, but metaphorically very complex. It gives no easy answer to the questions it raises, and that of course is its intention. Two things it is not are Nazi rivisionism or a Holocaust story. It deals with Germany's attempts to come to terms with its past and the scars that linger. Devastating, a must read.
0060523794|3.0|Consistent with Gerstner's cold and impersonal management style, \\"Elephants\\" is a clinical and sterile analysis of the author's days at IBM. What is surprising is that while living in the eye-of-the-storm through this mostly tumultuous period in IBM's extraordinarily rich and often bizarre history, Gerstner writes from afar, more an outsider looking in than the leader credited with the turnaround.<br />It is the success of the System 360, which carried IBM for decades and helped entrench an already insular and isolated culture, that was the villain, claims Gerstner. IBM needed to get in touch with the customer, get focused, and get back to the basics of execution. This is all true, and provides some interesting reading and insightful observation, but it leaves the reader yearning for more of the infighting and political maneuvering that was occurring both inside and outside the boardrooms. Those not familiar with IBM's unique culture will chuckle at some of the sparsely used anecdotes, while insiders will be disappointed in the virtual absence of any of the real drama that occurred, especially in the early months of Lou's tenure. Always the politician, names aren't named except for fleeting praise for select individuals. While Gerstner closes by claiming his deep love for a devotion to IBM, he still comes off as the perpetual outsider.<br />Perhaps one of the more interesting elements of the book is not what is told, or even what is left out, but rather what yet cannot be told. That is, five-years from now, will Gerstner's grand but unfinished plan to transform IBM into a services company still be considered a brilliant and bold strategic coup? Or will many of the changes in IBM over the past decade be simply attributed to adroit realignment of employee-related benefits and retirement benefits and long overdue expense reductions? We'll have to wait for Sam Palmisano's book to find out.
B00006RU5B|5.0|With a pounding monolithic and grandoise entrance, Audioslave announce their arrival with Cochise. It will be hard to escape any RATM / Soundgarden parallels on the opening track, but this is not RATM, it's not Soundgarden either. This is Audioslave. Cornell tells us he's not a martyr, not a prophet, he's right. He is the Voice.<BR>Rolling along next with a shuddering guitar hook is Show Me How To live. Held together with a steady Brad Wilk beat, the experience is building.<BR>The ante is upped with the next track, Gasoline. Spellbinding guitar licks by Morello , this band are truly on the front burner now, and we're only three tracks in.<BR>The first of many welcome surprises by this quartet is the thoughtful What you Are. Cornell demonstrates here how good his voice actually is, the anthemic chorus, hopefully soon to be belted out at an auditorium near you.<BR>Like A Stone is the next pleasant surprise, one of the stand out tracks here. It clearly belongs to Cornell, but along with a sumptious guitar line blends into an instant classic. Creed and other pretenders to the throne, this is what you're up against. Typically dark in lyrical content, but it's the softer side of Rock on display.<BR>A thumping Timmy C bass hook supplies the edge to Set It Off. Typical Morello trademark slice of guitar, it is one of the harder tracks on this rollercoaster of an album. <BR>Never has Chris Cornell's voice sounded so majestic and peerless on Shadow On The Sun. As many have said before, man, can this boy wail.<BR>I Am The Highway is another gem, displaying here the sum of all the players, a mellow swirling piece of musicianship. Again, a surprise considering earlier products by the quartet.<BR>The next two tracks push the work on further. Exploder is what you would expect on previous pedigree, reminiscent of vintage AC/DC. Hypnotise follows, with an alarming guitar backdrop that cuts through Brad Wilks frantic drumming.<BR>The slightly weaker Bring Em Back Alive is still wortha listen, once again Cornell utilises his vocal range to good effect, and this the prelude to another fantastic Audioslave impression. Light My Way just has to be a single, to bring it to a wider audience. Slightly mellow (again) but underpinned by more Morello twists and turns.<BR>The penultimate Getaway Car is a bluesy and pleasant affair prior to the final track, The Last Remaining Light. Cornell urges us to stand alone and greet the coming night, anything you say Sir. It harks back to Euphoria Morning but again it's a unique slice of what is Audioslave.<BR>Audioslave the Band, and Album was worth the wait. 65 minutes of a new sound, it's mellow, but yes it does rock , and so do Chris, Tim, Brad and Tom.
B00006L3S3|4.0|Only four stars.  That is not for the material, but for the remix.  The instruments do indeed sound clearer and more distinct than they did on either the LP release or the original CD.  That, like on the IMAGINE remix, is a much-needed improvement.  My issue is with the vocals.  John Lennon employed a delay effect (OK, he used it to death, to be perfectly honest) on his lead vocals to such a degree that it became his trademark (listen to Paul McCartney's vocal on \\"Let Me Roll It\\" from BAND ON THE RUN, a song written to John).  While there were times that one could argue against the effect, it is immediately identified with him and his music from this period.  Hearing these songs without that distinctive vocal effect is a bit like seeing AMERICAN GOTHIC without the pitch fork.<br />Now, about the music.  This album came out in 1973, following the abominable SOME TIME IN NEW YORK CITY.  MIND GAMES was a return to form, and enjoyed a much warmer reception.  Several of the songs on this album are among my favorite Lennon compositions.  \\"I Know\\" is a strikingly beautiful ballad with wonderful backing vocals.  \\"Tight A$\\" shows the sense of humor for which John was so famous and was sorely missing on his previous album.  Like others who have reviewed this album, I love \\"Meat City\\", a frenetic rocker that doesn't take itself too seriously.  The rest of the album is just as good.<br />My advice is to buy this remixed version to hear the drastic improvement in sound quality of the instruments, but do not part with your LP or previously-issued CD version.  Besides, comparing is half the fun, and in all fairness, the vocal delay was a bit overdone.  But it just seems to belong there now.<br />If anyone associated with the remixing should read this, please use restraint on WALLS AND BRIDGES.
0066214122|3.0|As in all Michael Crichton novels, the heart of this novel is Crichton's fascinating scientific speculation--in this novel about the implications of Nanotechnology.  Nanotechnology is the science of manufacturing microscopic machines.  This novel speculates about what might happen if this technology ran amok.<br />I've read nearly all of Crichton's books, and this one is remarkably different from the others as regards the writing style.  This novel is not written with Crichton's usual detached, third-person style, moving periodically among characters.  Instead, the narrative is in the first person--everything is seen from the perspective of one protagonist, who slowly, gradually, realizes the horror of the situation in which he finds himself.  The overall effect of this change in style is that the book is a much easier read than most of Crichton's other work.  In fact, it is fair to say that more than most of Crichton's other novels, this one is a real page-turner.  Mostly he does not sacrifice depth for this, and he does achieve a higher degree of clarity than in some of his other novels, notably &quot;Timeline.&quot;<br />Some of Crichton's scientific prognostications are (as usual for him) absolutely fascinating.  He clearly and convincingly explains how nanotechnology may come together as a fusion between mechanical and genetic engineering, and computer science.  Unfortunately, in my opinion in this novel he goes a bit too &quot;far out&quot; in that I did not find his speculation about the ultimate conclusion of the technology to be plausible.  Most Crichton novels pass the &quot;plausibility test&quot;--even &quot;Timeline&quot; did an acceptable job of suggesting a convincing scenario in which time travel might be possible--a difficult task indeed.  While I found some of Crichton's speculation about where nanotechnology might lead to be fascinating, some parts of this speculation seemed forced and ultimately not believable.  This lack of plausibility dropped this one to three stars in my opinion.<br />The ending of the novel is also not very satisfying.  Crichton could have done better.  Spoilers omitted here.<br />Despite the flaws mentioned here, this book is a ripping good read and every Crichton fan or lover of science fiction will want to read this one.this one to three stars in my opinion.<br />The ending of the novel is also not very satisfying.

0345413377|1.0|Why this book has received the awards and acclaim it has is simply beyond me. I loved The Golden Compass, and liked the Subtle Knife, but I would rename this third volume The Unsubtle Author. It is simply the most disappointing ending to a series I have ever read. There are holes in the plot big enough to drive an alternate universe through, thematic inconsistencies (how can the angels envy humans' material bodies if they are made of matter, too?), and worst of all, Pullman bashes us over the head with his anti-religion message, tacking on platitudes (Don't worry! Be cheerful!) to try to end his book on a positive note. His anti-authority/pro-knowledge message is ruined by the fact that nearly every piece of knowledge the charcters receive comes from some authority figure: a father, or an angel tells them about the nature of the spectres, or of \\"god\\", and they accept it without question?  This is the quest for knowledge?  Even at the end, they are still relying on magical devices rather than their own intellect to tell them the truth.  The climax of the book tries to equate carnal knowledge with intellectual knowledge, and that is, to anyone who has ever taught a hormonal 7th grader who can't focus on school work, as Pullman would say, \\"a lie.\\"
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is a fine adaptation of Michael Shaara's &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; which was a long-time best selling novel about the Battle of Gettysburg.  It is wonderfully done.<br />This film beautifully chronicles the clash between two of the greatest armies of all time at the pivotal battle of what was the greatest war in history up to that time.  Both sides are portrayed sympathetically, honorably, and honestly.  There is no &quot;Politically Correct&quot; Confederate-bashing here, although the film does not ignore the contradictions in the Confederate cause.  General Longstreet muses that &quot;I can never really think of those boys in blue as the enemy ... we broke the oath...&quot;<br />Some of the acting in this film is first-rate, some is not.  Tom Berenger is wonderful as General Longstreet, Martin Sheen is splendid as Robert E. Lee.  Jeff Daniels does a fine job as Col. Joshua Chamberlain.  Richard Jordan, as General Armistead, is absolutely unforgettable, both as the bold, inspiring general and the wistful, sorrowful warrior reluctant to do battle against his former friends.<br />Occasionally the film indulges in a bit of lengthy speechifying by the various characters about the war and related issues, but in this film that is OK, and I thought that this added to, rather than detracted from, the film experience.<br />This is a film that respects the viewer and does not try to push any particular political agenda--which is a surprise since Ted Turner was the moving force behind the production.  The battle scenes are extremely well-done and the accompanying musical score is a definite plus that adds to the pace of the film.<br />This is a film that you'll want to watch repeatedly over the years.  It faithfully follows Shaara's fine novel, rarely departing from it, and tells a great story in a respectful and sometimes inspiring manner.
0805062971|5.0|Has anyone here read Grendel AS WELL AS Fight Club? The two draw remarkable parallels when one looks at the underlying themes. Nihilism and the style of writing and humor in these two books are what make them identical. Anyone who has read either book should definitly read the other. By the way, Grendel is written John Gardner, and it is Beowulf told from Grendel's point of view.

B000063DHL|5.0|Out of all the Maiden albums this is the most melodic with some really beautiful riffs, great songs which just plain rock and an album which was undoubtedly the finest hour for guitarist Adrian Smith(guitar god).<br />Sadly however this album rarely gets a mention and is completely overlooked on Maidens latest live set, I will concede that this album is the most 80s like but I think class of this magnitude is timeless.  Songs from this album could vastly benefit Maiden's live set as they unbelievably still include songs like Sanctuary and Wrathchild which sound awful with Dickinson's voice, could you imagine Paul Di'Anno trying to sing Aces High or Flight of Icarus, please don't even try, hint hint Bruce!<br />CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME<BR>Quality opener, a song with a great drive and a good chorus which you'll be singing in no time.  The great drive in the song is the sort of thing that would have you unknowingly speeding if driving.  A great solo from Adrian that reaches for the stars in middle and great vocals from Dickinson throughout.<br />WASTED YEARS<BR>(Sings) So understand<BR>This was Maiden's attempt to go Mainstream searching for those<BR>radio years.<br />Ok this isn't my favourite song on the album because it's sounds like such a direct attempt for Maiden to get with the mainstream, tut tut.  What I love about Maiden is you don't see them on t.v and the Joe public is completely oblivious to them stuck in a world a mindless catchy, substanceless pop.  I shudder to think what would've happened if Maiden went mainstream.  All in all it's performed well with Nicko pulling off some unreal drumming patterns, a nice opening riff and good lyrics but it's not groundbreaking and it's far too soft, ohh Maiden, what were you thinking?<br />SEA OF MADNESS<BR>Now this is more like it, a darker tune with some heavy guitars which symbolise the madness theme and some strong bass to match.<BR>Again the lyrics are top notch but the real high point is in the middle when thesong bursts away from the darkness into some beautiful melodies followed by bass lines from Steve to die for, magic, love Bruce's little ooooh, ooooh,ooooh during this part, he soars for the high notes.<br />HEAVEN CAN'T WAIT<BR>This ones a mixed bag in that it's soft song and all in all quite a forgettable tune.  However the famous sing-along in the middle is unbelievable and turns a mediocre song into a great one, this should be on the live set all the time.<br />THE LONELINESS OF A LONG DISTANCE RUNNER<BR>Wow. Best song on the album and one of Maidens all time classics.  The riff is one of the best of all time, the lyrics brilliantly sum up the thinking of a sportsman (I use it to motivate myself) and the drive runs along like the runner.  The explosion in the middle is a masterstroke, kind of a pure victory riff, it's just magic.  You'll love it if you any kind of sportsman, even if your not.<br />STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND<BR>This song has a great feel to it, really captures the emotion of the lyrics.  This is Dickinson's best performance on the album not to mention the solo in the middle, OH MY GOD!<BR>The lyrics are top quality as always from Adrian Smith and this is his best ever song.<br />DE JA VU<BR>Dave and Adrian team up and create this little gem that is easily the most forgotten song on the album.  A great fast number with fantastic drumming from Nicko and great lyrics, love 'cause you know this has happened before' great energy and emotion from Dickinson. The lyrics possibly touch on having lived before, classic Maiden type subject make this a great song.<br />ALEXANDER THE GREAT (356-323 B.C)<BR>The classic Maiden epic album closer, the lyrics fit perfectly with the historical theme. A very grandiose drive/riff which suits it's theme perfectly fitting great drama, action, tragedy and victory on to one song, brilliant.

B00004WGAI|5.0|This was a brillant adaption without any of the Hollywood fluff.  The \\"film\\" stayed true to the novel in many respects, especially the \\"Gypsy\\" scene (spoiler--please read the book to get the full import of this scene--LOVED IT!) . . . Dalton played Mr. Rochester with sensitivity and the young lady who played \\"Jane Eyre\\" brought strength and dignity to the role.  This film did not disappoint me at all!
B00007E8V4|5.0|With System of a Down you could see a potential for corruption by the corporate music empire, but fortunately... that didn't happen. Instead they came out with this album which is so anti-commercial... you can't help but notice it. The content should be judged by the listener so I'll just leave it at that. It'll be worth your fat dirty dollars, trust me.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I ordered George Harrison's final album, \\"Brainwashed,\\" without having heard a single track, and I'm glad I did.  Although his voice sounds a little thin at times from the throat cancer that would tragically take his life in November of 2001, the overall sound of the CD is terrific, and the song selections are classic Harrison.  \\"Rising Sun\\" reminds me of the Beatles, or at least the way the Beatles would sound if all members were alive and performing today; a masterpiece of a song.  George also does a cool remake of a 1930 song I hadn't heard before, \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" (co-composed by Harold \\"Over the Rainbow\\" Arlen).  Great guitar work throughout the CD, wonderful tight harmonies by all, super contributions from George's son Dhani, and a CD I recommend without qualification.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I rate this DVD pack as 4.5 with a tilt towards 5.  <BR>It is simply a very hearty well-characterized series, that plays out the evolvement of the Band over the course of 4 years ... from Basic Training in the States through D-Day to the Bulge, sweeping into Germany, concentration camps and the eventual liberation of Berlin.  Although obviously made for TV and not the big screen, it's a &quot;followup&quot; of Saving Private Ryan by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks .  <BR>A distinct highlight is the Extra Features, especially the interviews of the actual surviving members of the Band ... who still carry so much of the feelings and memories of their days over there.  Our thanks to all our fathers and mothers who did their best to keep this continent free from blatant insane oppression.  <BR>The impressions - many very deep - that this series left with me are too many to relate here, but I strongly suggest that we all go out and buy this keeper, for ourselves and future generations.  Like the documentary series &quot;The World at War,&quot; this is a must buy.  Be prepared to feel dismay, intense dislike, compassion, sorrow and many other things as you view this set.
B00006ZSAD|5.0|Great! I love Beth's voice, it's beautiful. Probably any Portishead fan will like this, although there is a big difference between Portishead and this album. Portishead is rather cold and distant music, this CD is much warmer, which is caused by the music. Portishead always sounds very sad (it makes me think of rainy streets in London), Beth solo (ok, not solo but with Rustin Man) has a different touch. Hard to name it. Sorry.

B00005JL3A|3.0|This movie is a no-no except for those who expect only bashing and crashing. You won't like it unless you don't want a good script, just eye-candy and kung-fu. Milla Jovovich is somekind of a Superwoman with a temporary amnesia and the movie is filled with errors that were just about impossible to miss. The director is the man who made the Mortal Kombat movie, so if you saw it you know what to see in this thingie.  <BR>If you liked the video game though, you might like the because it follows the pattern and Ms. Milla shows more than just her attitude...
B00007E8V4|5.0|This cd is awesome.  SOAD is my favorite band and they have created another great cd.  I was going to try to recommend some other cd that you would like along with this but it is impossible because they sound so different from everyone else, especially in this cd.  It even sounds a lot different from their other two albums but don't let that stop you from buying it.  Its still SOAD so its impossible for it to be bad.  I really hope they go on tour so I can see these songs live.

0790733900|5.0|This movie is anything but cool. The characters are rough, foul, and awkward. The setting is realistic and harsh. It takes place in the scorching sun and humidity. There's many a scene of sweat and overheating men. Luke, though, is cool. He's the figure of composure; he's classy, smart, proud, and witty, but he rarely talks, keeping aloof. Or he's independent free man who won't let anyone get him down.<br />There's a scene when he bluffs his way to victory in a poker match, thus his nickname &quot;cool hand Luke&quot;. Another scene has him fighting with another inmate until he's nearly unconscious, but he never surrenders. Yet another has him eating 50 eggs in an hour for a bet, and he doesn't give up. And I think this is the metaphor for the rest of the film. You can either see him as a cocky stubborn man, or more appropriately, a man who won't give up his freedom. He's thrown in prison and chain gang labor for a case of petty vandalism during a drunken stupor, yet he never utters a word about it, even during the most humiliating or painful punishment, but his conviction and sentence are hardly a matter in this film. Here is a man who is troubled and dysfunctional (as the story slightly exposes), but is already in an advanced state of personal freedom. Though he'd like to be living a normal life, searches for it, and deserves as much, he doesn't need it. He's spiritually and mentally invincible, and eventually it leads to his ultimate fate.<br />Cool Hand Luke is a marvelous film. It's one fourth romantic, three fourths gritty reality. Paul Newman and the gorgeous cinematography are the romance. Newman nearly carries the film. Here's this movie star, a charismatic leading man who liberally uses his smile to get himself through scenes, but he immerses himself into his character. I think Luke is one of the greatest, most complex male characters to grace the screen, and Newman is really the only actor who could ever do him justice. But he isn't playing Newman, he's playing Luke, every inch of Luke.  He IS Luke, he is this renegade rebel, this charming dapper Dan, and this tragic everyman.  Newman's supporting cast is superb, in one of the best acted films I've ever seen. George Kennedy is incredible as the only sizable supporting character, though the rest of the cast do their utmost to fit their roles, especially the various sinister and slimy wardens, and they do it beautifully. No actor wastes his time on screen. They create the atmosphere.<br />I just have to mention the dialogue. This is one of those films with incredible dialogue. Nothing is sappy or soupy. It embraces wit and logic, a lovely razor sharpness, and a down to earth realism. Every sentence is perfectly placed, there are no superfluous words, every character with they're own style that still allow them to sound like real people. End of dialogue discussion.<br />This film is simple. It's simply told, simply filmed, and on the outside it's a simple story, but I think it delves a lot deeper than at first appearance. It's unpretentious. Without us knowing it paints an environment, it paints a setting. It's a movie with certain faintly stylized points and flourishes, with a bit of a Southern storytelling air and lilt to it, and a definite love for fun. But it's intense, from the acting, to plot twists and character developements, to minor &quot;action&quot; sequences (a movie populated by inmates and movie stars has to have some excitement), it has incredible depth in it's subtle symbolism and it's layered messages and it's performances with their emotional tapestries. Thus, it has an immense replayability quotient.<br />This is drama at it's finest. It is a complex intriguing film that can get under your skin in it's rawness, but can still entertain you, and send you into that dreamy mesmerized state of being in awe of a film and the characters portrayed in it.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I haven't much to say since I have to get off the net, but I will say this - This cd is must get for people who have never listened to Soundgarden or Rage Against The Machine and for people who are currently one of those fans. With the new singer its great! and its also good if you have a play list with Ratm and Audioslave playing. Its wicked!. Anyways I got to go now.
B00006JDVV|3.0|Okay, take a step back gentlemen, because the lady here is going to put her two cents in. <BR> I am a big fan of films that give a glimpse of what the future may be like (example: Mad Max, Terminator, yada yada) I like the story buried within this film's script but the pace was less than pleasing. I would have liked to have seen more of the early struggles between man and dragons, even if it were flashbacks.<br />One thing that did annoy me about this film..the mumbling! I can't tell you how many times I had to rewind a scene just so I could understand what was said. A hint love..talk a wee bit slower when you have a thick accent like that!<br />Overall, I enjoyed the film. The special effects were good, the story, while lacking in details, and dialogue lacking in depth, still kept my interest. I also believe all the actors gave a fine effort...and speaking of fine! <br />We have THREE that's right, count em', three gorgeous men in this film that should make the ladies want to rent this flick at least once! <br />Christian Bale - Okay not really diggin' the hairy look but hey what can you expect it's like the end of the world. I'll always remember him from Little Women and the delicious role in American Psycho. <br />Gerard Butler - One word ladies; Atilla. Those of you who didn't see this man in that original picture made by the USA network, get your backend to Blockbuster now! Those of you who have seen it, you all know you wanted to invade his tent and conquer that Great King of the Huns!<br />Matthew McConaughey - I'm still recovering from how beautiful this man's body has become! In fact, I'm still purring! And that whole \\"..bring down the beast\\" line made me melt into a puddle on the floor, I don't know about y'all but he definitely does it for me..<br />Bottom line. I think the guys will dig the violence, and special effects, and we ladies will just enjoy a bunch of sexy men running about looking to woop some dragon tail..<br />Nothing too special about thismovie. I don't know if I'll buy it, but it's a good weekend rental.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|MIB 1 was one of my most favorite movies.  So I bought MIB II.  What a total dissapointment.  One of the worst movies ever made. The acting, script, almost everything except the special effects where poorly done.  This is total hollywood trash at its worst. <br />I fell a sleep during the movie - that's how bad it was.  <br />This one might even get sold at a discount retailer.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Okay, I'm going to make this review short and sweet.  Mainly because all the stuff I would like to say has been said by many, and I don't want this review to look like a repeat.  I loved Nirvana when I was in junior high, I loved them when I was in high school, and I still love them now while I'm in college.<br />I can't help but feel somewhat disappointed with this greatest hits collection.  There's 14 songs.  Now, for a regular album, that's a nice number, but for a greatest hits collection, I was expecting a few more songs.  Yes, these are the ones that have been played on the radio and on MTV (a time when MTV actually played music videos!  Those were the days!).  A lot of their best songs are the ones that never got air-play.  It's amazing how some of the junk today gets non-stop air-play and some of Nirvana's greatest songs never did.  Just look at the album, &quot;Nevermind.&quot;  Every song on that album is pure gold, and a couple of them never even made it on the air, as with the other albums.<br />The new song, &quot;you know you're right,&quot; while it is a very good one, it's not their greatest one.  In fact, my fear is that the radio is going to play it so many times it's going to become annoying.  (&quot;Higher&quot; by Creed, anyone?)  It's a great song, but that's the only extra feature to the album.<br />Maybe I am only looking at what's NOT here as opposed to what IS here.  Don't get me wrong, these are all great songs and I'm glad they made it on the album.  I was just expecting a little more, I guess.  Am I happy with it?  Of course.  Could it have been better?  Yes it could've.  But then again, that's the case with most things.  Guess sometimes we just need to be happy with what we get.<br />I'm just thinking this could've been so much more, and I get the feeling I'm not the only one who thinks so.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Rising from the ashes of two of the biggest groups of the 90's, Audioslave's debut is nothing short of great.  Mixing hints of Rage's fury and funk with Soundgarden's amazing vocals.  Highlighted by the pounding &quot;Gasoline&quot; Audioslave is what music should be, an escape.  Songs like &quot;Like a Stone&quot; and &quot;I Am The Highway&quot; show off the ex-Rage members range musically while Chris is always there with solid vocals.  Fans of both bands should be happy that they are making music this good.
1558216847|5.0|The reviewers who don't believe that this is a true story have never talked to actual survivors of Soviet prison camps, nor read any of their stories - they belong to the group that do not believe that German death camps existed. Shackleton's story of his voyage in a small open boat through the roaring Fifties, and then his walk across uncharted mountains on the island of South Georgia, sounds equally unbelievable.<br />Many books have been written by survivors of the Gulags, unfortunately not many in English. This story is heart wrenching in its descriptions of the hardships suffered by the group in their quest for freedom. Undoubtedly some details may have been embellished, and actual facts were forgotten. After all the survivors spent four weeks in hospital in delirium after reaching India. <br />Some reviewers doubt that the few inhabitants of the wilds of Mongolia and Tibet, encountered by the group, treated them so kindly. Many stories about the hospitality of the villagers in these remote hamlets  have been written. They do not believe that the Soviet camp was so lightly guarded. They did not read very carefully, the conditions described make it clear that escape was almost impossible. Devil's Island was lightly guarded for the same reason.<br />I believe the story and find it a remarkable testimony to the intense desire for freedom. By all means you should read it.

Because of its optimistic message, its simplicity of meaning and language it is easily read, quite popular amongst youngsters, all together accounting for its status as a bestseller.<BR>It is a fable in which a young boy by the name of Santiago is called to go in search of his &quot;Personal Myth.&quot;  It is a journey of exploration, of self-discovery, narrated in a language of symbolism, dreams, and mysticism.  The message Paulo Coelho wishes to share with his readers is that everyone should be able to interpret the events encountered throughout our existence and be able to follow them in search of the ultimate fulfillment and meaning in life.  We should not be afraid to follow our destiny, our dreams, everything is possible as long as we really want it to happen, and what is to be avoided is to sacrifice fulfillment to conformity.  The treasure is not what is to be found at the end of the journey, but the journey itself and the wisdom acquired in the process.<br />   &quot;Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse<BR>   than the suffering itself,&quot; the alchemist replies.<BR>   &quot;And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes<BR>   in search of its dreams, because every second of the<BR>   search is a second´s encounter with God and with<BR>   eternity.&quot;<br />Paulo Coelho himself is a non-conformit, a writer who himself went on a long search for his personal fulfillment.  His success relies much in telling people what they want to hear (an illusive reality), using a language that does not speak to the brain but rather to the heart.  His writings follow similar lines as other writers such as Livingston, Carlos Castaneda, Ben Okri, John Redfield, Deepak Choppra, Rodney Ballenden, Merrick Rosenberg, all of them in search of a way of life which will enrich the meaning of existence and bring a message of hope.
B00004NHCC|4.0|At this stage of her career Vaughan was often put in front of larger bands; here, however, she's working just with Jimmy Jones's trio plus three horns: tenor saxophonist Paul Quinichette, flautist Herbie Mann &amp; the great trumpeter Clifford Brown. The arrangements are by Ernie Wilkins, though the tracks aren't in fact highly &quot;arranged&quot; in feel.<br />Sarah Vaughan's voice was of course at its freshest &amp; loveliest at this point, &amp; it's truly mesmerizing no matter what the material.  Or perhaps I should say &quot;despite the material&quot;: there's an odd mix of classic songs like &quot;September Song&quot;, &quot;April in Paris&quot; &amp; &quot;Embraceable You&quot; with material that hardly was up to that calibre. &quot;Lullaby of Birdland&quot; is a great tune, but it's an instrumental: the lyrics superadded to Shearing's melody are truly atrocious, &amp; Vaughan's near-operatic voice can't do much with rhymes like &quot;birdland&quot; and &quot;word-land&quot;, or phrases like &quot;magic music we make with our lips when we kiss&quot;. &quot;Jim&quot;'s lyrics mine the same kind of helpless pathos one associates with some of Billie Holiday's setpieces, &amp; Vaughan's reading has some noticeable Holiday inflections, but it's not exactly a great tune, with a wretchedly clumsy B section lyric (rhyming &quot;call it quits&quot; with &quot;breaking my heart in bits&quot;....ouch!). -- All that said, Vaughan's superb on the material which actually can sustain some interpretive weight.  &quot;April in Paris&quot; &amp; &quot;Embraceable You&quot; are both done at dead-slow tempos &amp; are very lovely; &quot;Lullaby of Birdland&quot;, despite the rotten lyrics, also has an excellent bit of scatting on it.<br />The band is rather mixed.  Herbie Mann is pretty undistinguished, tooting away rather vaguely &amp; not showing much ability here as an improvisor.  Quinichette was one of the most faithful of Lester Young's imitators--he was often dubbed &quot;the Vice-Prez&quot;--&amp; while he doesn't set a foot wrong here, on the other hand does nothing especially distinctive, with a softness &amp; blandness that compare poorly with the wonderful foggy, misterioso inwardness of his role model's playing.  The unquestioned star on the disc is Clifford Brown, whose perfectly focussed &amp; poised solos completely outshine the efforts of his companions except, of course, Vaughan herself.<br />A very good album, despite its imperfections.  It's a pity that the relationship between Vaughan &amp; Brown wasn't sustained beyond this one album.  Listeners who want to hear more of Brown's work with singers are directed to his work with Helen Merrill.
B00003CX5P|3.0|This movie is essential to the Star Wars fan!  However, those who have not seen the light will find the movie to be slow at times, a little like a soap opera where if you miss something you won't understand what's happening later.  Typical to Lucas, the effects are something beyond belief, or more accurately, they make you believe...
B000063NPX|5.0|The DVD sound and video is excellent. My daughter loves it and so does the entire family. A MUST BUY.
B00005JKG9|5.0|I'm so happy this has finally been released on DVD - and what a transfer - fantastic widescreen format, clean, crisp, and the best way I've ever viewed this movie. Deserverdly so, seeing as GGR is such a great movie.<br />Even though direcror Foley's commentary on Disc 1 (widescreen) is definitely worth listening to, it isn't particularly insightful. The commentaries on Disc 2 (full screen) are better... it's good to hear input from Baldwin and Arkin, but I'd have loved to have had the Jack Lemmon commentary from the original laser disc version included as well.<br />The extras are good, in their way, but it would have been great to have heard from Mamet himself, and get more insight into the movie/play, even though the stuff about salesmen is most certainly interesting and a worthy addition.<br />There's also a cool Easter Egg on the second disc, but that's for closers only.
B0000251W3|5.0|This is the all time classic Maiden Album.  Even the artwork is my favourite out of all their albums.  The full spectrum of music from driving metal to entrancing harmonies create an incedible listening atmosphere. The entire band's performance is 5 star with the MVP being shared by Bruce and Nicko.
B000002NZO|4.0|There's not a lot of talk about this album in general. When discussions aboout Genesis occur, rarely do you hear \\"Yeah! Trespass! Man! Great!\\" It's a very underappreciated album.<br />It is also an album I had to discover circuitiously. I was only 1 year old when it was released, and I was still playing in mud when Gabriel left Genesis for a solo career. It was through Gabriel (particularly through his huge MTV hit \\"Shock the Monkey\\") that I would eventually find \\"Trespass.\\" Genesis, and progressive rock in general, is shocking in comparison to today's rock. By pop music standards, Genesis are accomplished musicians. The compositions are complex and not mono-chord monotonous. Some are continuous pieces without a repeating chorus. Time sigantures change and moods swing within each song. Pretty much unheard of by today's standards, which is sad.<br />\\"Trespass\\" is a beautiful album. The music is melodic and can almost be described as 1970s-baroque (I think classical music fans are likely to appreciate progressive rock - the 2 genres are pretty similar in form). The songs tend to be on the longer side (above 6 minutes) which is standard for Genesis up to and including \\"Selling England By the Pound.\\" Some of the lyrics show their age. They're whimsical, almost mythological at times. They sometimes dance on the border of inspiring and corny, but they never topple into the realm of the intolerably ridiculous.<br />The last song on the album, \\"The Knife,\\" has a beginning keyboard riff that will occupy your braincells without mercy. It is one of Genesis' best songs. An interesting thing about it is, without knowing more about the band and their members, it can come across as a serious \\"heroic\\" song about war and martrydom. It has that much passion, and that little subtlety. Once when I was walking with a friend, the song popped into my head and I, without thinking, sang outloud the memorable line: \\"Some of you are going to die, martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide.\\" The person I was walking with did a double-take and wanted to know which department of propaganda I pulled that one from. Explaining that it was just an old Genesis song confused the person more (most people of my generation can't help hearing \\"Invisible Touch\\" when the band Genesis is mentioned, and the band's history is hard to relate to anyone completely unfamiliar with it). I thought about it more, and realized that the song could be easy to misconstrue, but was that a strength or a weakness? Maybe both! Nonetheless, \\"The Knife\\" is a great song, and the fact that it is not subtle adds to it immeasurably.<br />It's hard to believe that only 5 guys made such nice noise. they hadn't perfected their craft yet, but they were very close.provide.\\" The person I was walking with did a double-take and wanted to know which department of propaganda I pulled that one from.

B00007E8V4|5.0|The eastern-europe-LA-west-coast-american band is back. I must say i've been waiting with heavy anticipation for this one, ever since I listened to Toxicity for the zilljonth time and thought \\"what in the world will they do next time, hope that album dosn't sound crap compared to this epic?\\" I really didnt think they could make it. <br />They're debut System of a Down was heavy pollitical and fast grinding guitars. Next comes Toxicity, a brilliant melodic eruptic rock and hardcore epic with, IMO, milder lyrics. I thought probably the next one would be even softer and melodic, closing in on girl-rockband Creed(tm). Then songs from the album leak on to the internet and from there to some radiostations. I thought, oh well, good rock but crappy sound(mp3=bad) and a bit of a spoiler. Then a few months later, out comes \\"Steal this album\\", the name and brilliant cover art propably referring to the idiots who leaked out the tapes. I buy it (didnt steal it :), put in in the hi-fi, and we're off. <br />    Chick N Stu, fast grindcore with repeating lyrics ala Shjerj style..i'm thinking good song, kinda funny writing a song about pizza. Next song....i'm sold. Innervision, first single I think, brilliant rythmguitar madness and melodies. Bubbles, Boom, Nuguns,A.d.d.,Mr.jack better, better, better, better. This goes on and on and ends on a goozebump high octave rising Streamline rollercoaster. Streamline is  a positive single, Mr. Jack could be but it's propably got too strong lyrics. I-E-A-I-A-I-O single. Bubble will be a single I think. This record also has a lot more political and stronger lyrics than Toxocity, which shows  guts in the hyperallert post-11.september america in my oppinion. <BR>    <BR>    This album is not good. Ive had in in my hi-fi since I bought it. It does not go off, it will not. I just got Audioslave recently wich is good but it just dosn't fit in my stereo 'cause I just cant take the SOAD CD off. My life is System of a Down now. It is my east and my sun. This is a bloody masterpiece. And its better than Toxicity.
B00007E8V4|4.0|these are songs that could have been on &quot;Toxicity&quot; but weren't because they didnt fit in with the mood of the album. <br />by absolutely no means are these songs that weren't good enough. in fact, maybe even better than toxicity. sure there isnt the radio hit &quot;chop suey!&quot;, but the first single from this album &quot;innervision&quot; is a much more interesting song. other great tracks on this album are &quot;A.D.D.&quot; and &quot;I-E-A-I-A-I-O&quot; which are politically charged, like much of SoaD's music. &quot;Roulette&quot; is an accoustic song that was written like 7 years ago. its also one of the better tracks. there really is no bad song on this album. &quot;F**k the system&quot; is pretty cool, although there are no real lyrics to it aside from the title which is repeated many, many times. <br />if you are a fan of System of a Down and think this is just a bunch of songs not good enough for the other album, then think again. <br />if you haven't heard much of the band, this is a great album to listen to first.

0066214122|4.0|As part of a broad public discussion, not a specifically scientific one, Michael Crichton reaches into the deep thick darkness of our future with his new book, &quot;Prey,&quot; and viscerally pulls out some issues, some potential realities, with his poetry-prose, that are so central to our continued breathing and cognition that we are well advised to ignore the obvious scientific weaknesses of many parts of this book.  The issues he brings up include the development of nano and bio technologies, artificial life, and swarm and emergent behavior.<BR> The plot of &quot;Prey&quot; is formulaic in many respects, following closely in the footsteps of books such as &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; which was the first real story about artifical intelligence, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and, of course, &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;<BR> In ignoring these varied faults, as we read &quot;Prey,&quot; we sit quietly on this beautiful dark night and get a glimpse of the deeper issues that glimmer, simmering, on our nearest horizon.
B000075BFK|5.0|If you like tupac go buy the album i think it's good The only bad thing about it is that they put nas on it and they were enemies they made it look like they were firends and they weren't but over all it's good go get it
B000069I1H|3.0|Buddy-buddy movie comes with star-star concept.  That's what I thought about \\"Showtime\\" when I watched its trailer.  And the fact is, it was.  <br />As director Tom Dey united Jackie Chan with Owen Wilson in \\"Shanghai Noon,\\" he again makes a combination of Eddie Murphy with Robert Deniro.  As \\"Shanghai Noon\\" is passable entertainment (but not definitely the best of Jackie), so \\"Showtime\\" is again passable entertainment with not-so-good Eddie and not-so-good DeNiro.  Plus, in the fashion of \\"Lethal Weapon\\" series, they added Rene Russo.  But it's no wonder; for the two of the screenplay writers, Alfred Gough and Miles Miller are responsible for \\"Lethal Weapon 4.\\"  Too classic.<br />Anyway, \\"Showtime\\" shows how these two stars Murphy and DeNiro crack the case of secretly-made deadly weapons, which can easily tear down a house.  Along the investigation, you see ambitious TV producer Rene Russo take advantage of Deniro's blundered case, and use the most unlikely pair as the feature of her new reality TV show named, why not, \\"Showtime.\\"  <br />Basically \\"Showtime\\" -- I mean this film itself -- should not be taken too seriously.  Though the film has something to say about the media, it knows it is also part of the media, so it doesn't pose any serious questions before us.  It rather is intent on making use of the pair, which, however, works very sporadically.  Humor is there, good-natured feeling is also there, but these feelings just fail to be felt by us.  In short, the film lacks chemistry.   Usually delightful Rene Russo ends up with being clithed and banal, and bad guys are just bad guys without any menace or dark humor.  Willaim Shatner appears as a guest, almost as himself when he did his own police drama 20 years ago, but hey, how many people remember that?  For some reason, they decided to include a cameo of one famous lawyer JC, but what we need is some other things or people, something that would enliven the whole show.  <br />Actions are staged decently, withexplosions and cars and a big dish, but the fact that these actions are impressive means these two stars are really wasted, having lost their opportunity to impress us.  You have no irresistible chemistry between Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in \\"48hrs,\\" which made the latter an instant star, or comical feelings generated between Charles Groding and Robert DeNiro in \\"Midnight Run.\\"  \\"Showtime\\" is just an OK film; it is enjoyable to some extent, but fails to offer anything refreshing or inspired.
B00001OH7U|5.0|The already established 'thin white duke' continued his 'fame' with the single release of &quot;Golden Years&quot;, a warm, but tepid dance song that introduced the fantastic &quot;Station To Station&quot;.  The title track clocks in the lengthiest of his songs and provides a series of bridges and chorus changes that surpassed anything he had done to date.  The entire sound is more bluesy with the power-ballads &quot;Word On A Wing&quot; and &quot;Wild Is The Wind&quot;.  &quot;Stay&quot; is is the funkiest and most 'blue-eyed' of the set, while &quot;TVC15&quot; simply delivers a well written novelty tune.  This set was more of a second version of &quot;Young Americans&quot; rather than a new direction, but if it's not broke - don't fix it.  That's pretty hard for soemone like Bowie to do, considering how many 'costume changes' he goes through each year.
B00006RU5B|5.0|From the moment i heard about this SUPERGROUP the hairs on my neck stood up - and when i listened to the album i almost exploded with joy - Take Soundgardens deep tones and soulfull tunes and add a large slice or Rage thumbing bass drum guitar combo and u get THE BEST ALBUM OF 2002!!!

B00005JL2O|5.0|Goldmember is the best film of the Austin Powers franchise. One of the highest grossing comedies of all time, making $77 million in its first weekend! You'll see Britney Spears, Tom Cruise and many more. The Austin Powers franchise is one that will not die out anytime soon. I recommend you buy this and make a collection of the Austin Powers movies. Very entertaining and exciting to watch.
0316666343|4.0|This is the first book I have read in a long time in which I actually ached for the characters. Susie's family becomes so alive and real for the reader. After the first chapter (the most painful one to read) I was hooked. <br />The cover of the book pretty much sums it up, with a single house hanging from a charm bracelet. Even after Susie's death, her focus is on Earth and her family, not on heaven. This is not a book about heaven--it's about life. Sebold's depiction of heaven is unique and fresh, but most of the novel centers around what's happening on Earth to Susie's family and friends. The poignancy of the book lies in her dilemma--trapped in heaven, she experiences the Alice in Wonderland phenomenon--she can watch her family as they begin to heal and move on without her, but she's forever stuck on the other side of the glass, the divide between the living and the dead. This dynamic creates a heart-wrenching, bittersweet narrative and a truly memorable piece of literature.<br />I'll agree that the end of the novel seems a bit of a stretch, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. However, I still think that ending was necessary to tie up some thematic loose ends. Overall, Sebold's writing is top-notch. I recommend The Lovely Bones to anyone who ever muses about life after death. This book has a lot of substance to it. If you thought it was pointless, try rereading it, because you probably missed something.
B00006LSM3|3.0|Without a doubt, BRAINWASHED contains, consistently, George Harrison's greatest bunch of songs since ALL THINGS MUST PASS, both biting and moving in that simultaneous way only Harrison was capable of. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to give the album an honest listen, since Jeff Lynne managed to mutilate nearly every track by smothering them  with his gruesome trademark of subpar bubblegum mush (save for \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii\\" and the cover of \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\"). Why was Harrison so enamored with this jerk? Lynne ruined the Traveling Wilburys sound, giving the albums a sugary gloss entirely at odds with their (semi)acoustic appeal, and now he's done his best to ruin Harrison's swan song. If you thought CLOUD NINE was overproduced, avoid BRAINWASHED; while the songs are much better, the sound quality is borderline unbearable.
B00006LFGD|1.0|Barbra, Barbra, Barbra. Following your not-so-essential collection earlier this year, we are given another rehash of a career with no more life. How can someone so intelligent with such a great  voice have so little creativity? Your albums have been mundane since whatever came after Guilty(Yentl doesn't count, it was a soundtrack!). You had the chance to do something with yourself. Do whatever you need to do, but please let this be the last compilation! And by the way, a duet with yourself is not a duet.
0060523794|1.0|Louis Gerstner's book does more than make short shrift of the company's greatest software challenge, that is the crisis with OS/2. The book also completely avoids any mention of the greatest moral crisis to grip the company when in February 2001 the world learned that IBM had become Hitler's willing efficiency expert during the Holocaust, from 1933 to 1945. IBM technology organized the concentration camps and the Extermination by Labor campaign. Instead of simply owning up to the history and apologizing, IBM, under Gerstner, blocked access to records, launched a disinformation campaign, refused to apologize to survivors and consistently claimed the firm simply had no information on the topic. The Hitler-era crime and the 21st Century cover-up forever tarnished IBM. Yet Gerstner has conveniently deleted the entire matter from his chapters. The elephant danced around the topic completely.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|Unfortunately MIIB did not deliver as well as the orginal, but it still has lots of action and comedy. The movie basically flopped at the box office compared to the first MIB film. The feel of the theme just didn't come back while watching this movie. I'd be suprised if there will be a MIIIB, Men In Black is being pulled to the ground and trangled and cannot compete against films such as James Bond 007 and the Jurassic Park films. Steven Spielberg should work more on his other movie franchise's instead of MIB. I recommend that you don't buy but rent this movie. Not great enough to add to your DVD collection, rather rent MIIB. We all have different opinions and this is mine.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin disbanded a while back, before the tragic death of their beloved drummer, John Bonham. And while everyone is praying for a Led Zeppelin reunion, I don't need one. Led Zeppelin lives in our theatre. Okay, not really. I'll explain: I'm a technician for our school's theatre and, in between shows, we love to crank out the tunes, be it Metallica, Guns N Roses, The Eagles, AC/DC or Ozzy Osbourne. But most of the time, the CDs lying around the CD player (hooked up to the theatre's sound system, of course) are everything less than satisfying. However, we all agree: Led Zeppelin IV is one of the best albums of all time. We play it whenever we can because, quite frankly, all the songs are good. Nah, scratch that. All the songs are AMAZING! The disc opens with \\"Black Dog\\" which gets you groovin'. It's a great hard rock tune that we all sing along to (while one of us tries to play the song on guitar). Next is \\"Rock & Roll\\", the perfect blend of 50s and 70s rock. A great rock tune that you can actually dance to. The third track is \\"The Battle of Evermore\\", which happens to be my personal favorite on the disc. The folk-influenced melody functions great with Jimmy Page's amazing guitar skills. Rob Plant's lyrics are very cool, containing references to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" (\\"The drums will shake the castle walls, the ring-wraiths ride in Black\\"). Sandy Denny's backing vocals are great too (too bad she would die eight years later in a tragic staircase accident). And speaking of staircases, next is what most Technicians consider to be the best song of all time: the immortal \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" (one considers it a sin to skip this track). So much has already been said about this track, so I won't babble on about it. However, it can be said that this song, along with Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb\\", can be considered the best songs of all time. For all you record collectors, we've now arrived on side B of Zeppelin IV. The track that kicks it off is the strange hippy-esque \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" (another Tolkien reference). It takes some getting used to, but we all agree that it's an essential Zeppelin tune. \\"Four Sticks\\" follows and features some great bass by John Paul Jones. This is a strange one. It doesn't know whether it wants to have you relax or rock out. I have mixed feelings about this song, as do much of my friends. \\"Going to California\\" reprises the folk style started on \\"The Battle of Evermore\\". And where \\"Evermore\\" was mystical and epic, \\"California\\" is a common folk song, dealing with real-world topics in favor of \\"The Queen of Light\\". Another one of my favorites. And now your trip is over. The album closes with the epic \\"When the Levee Breaks\\", which showcases Bonham's drumming and Page's guitar. A unique piece, this tune deals with the destruction of the Earth. What a way to end the album! Someone I know once said \\"Every Zeppelin tune has its own sound, and can be easily identified because of that.\\" For that matter, you'll never confuse \\"Levee\\" with anything else on the album, because of its uniqueness. This album is part of a list I am compiling of essential albums needed in our theatre to play between shows. So far, this, AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\", and Queen's \\"Greatest Hits 1 & 2\\" have made the list. More will follow. Our tech staff agrees, this is one of the most essential albums you'll ever own. <br />Buy it now and play it loud.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|The movie was fabulous which everyone already knows. What also is fabulous is the extras on the 2 Dics DVD set. The most interesting part is probably the entire movie making process. From the start of creating the story to the finished product of actually going on the computers and animating the characters. The original story which is done in storyboards and narrated shows that the original story was far from the finished product. They changed many aspects of the plot and characters to make it just right. Pixar put a lot of work into this DVD as with their others. I cannot wait for their next film Finding Nemo to be released.
0780021150|3.0|Peter Lorre was the highlight of this film.  But, after watching this film, I am confused as to what exactly was so horrifying. I see far more horrifying images on the nightly news.  Peter Lorre's character is never fully developed - as a viewer you have no insight into his dementia. It would have been a far better film to have been better informed as to his past insanity. If you are expecting a modern psychological thriller - you will be disappointed.  It may be impossible for such an old film to have the intense psychological impact of modern films.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This is what true fans of SOAD have been waiting for. All the good old b-sides we pulled off MX and KaZaA have been mastered and studio recorded. This isn't only a collection of (pardon this) \\"old new songs\\", it's a testament to the fact that tracks that don't make it on disc the first time around may just have a second shot.<br />-Johnny Zero-
B00005YW4H|4.0|I heard the first track ..., saw the CD was reasonably priced, and bought it.  Jones voice on the first track along with the instrumentals is REALLY REALLY good.  I agree with others when they she gets my vote for Best New Artist.  Unfortunately none of the following tracks can  measure up to the first stunning track.  The rest of the music is pretty good if you like soft relaxing music.  The more country inspired songs were interesting.  My only complaint would be that the other tracks are not as good as the first.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album was amazing.  The contrasting styles made it interesting to listen to.  Tom Morello has to be one of the greatest guitar players ever, and he showed it on this album not only through his crazy guitar sounds and larger than life riffs, but through the diversity of the styles he plays in.  He can go from a riff-heavy song right into a very bluesy song.  Chris Cornell is amazing as always and I espically liked the way he sounded on the slower songs.  The rythem section is amazing as always with the solid drumming of brad wilk and the great bass playing of tim commerford.  This is an amazing album.  It should be in your collection.
0553260111|5.0|I thought this book was really good.  Robert Ludlum is a good author.  I read this book right before the movie came out.  I think one of the things I liked about it was the characters and what they go through in the book.  Jason Bourne is my favorite character in this book.  The emotional things he has to go through are interesting, and educational at the same time.  I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes Robert Ludlum, or spy thrillers.
B00006RU5B|5.0|It was exciting to first hear about the merging of these two powerful musical forces, the very funky, very heavy riffs of the rage rhythm section and the strong, unusual, yet very natural melodic writing and voice that is Chris Cornell.  The final result was amazing!  I could tell there was chemistry as soon as I heard the demos leaked on line, and when I heard the final production for the first time, It felt like the arrival, and beginning of something huge!  The songwriting is extremely mature, yet satisfying to the primal urge just to hear something that really rocks.  &quot;Show me how to live&quot; is a great example of the band's effective use of space and true equality among members to create a powerful whole song.  The prosody between the lyrics and mood of the music, the anger and confusion, just blows the listener away!  And the album is a very complete whole, the saddening mellow &quot;Like a Stone&quot;, and the soulful bluesy &quot;Getaway Car&quot;  provide perfect balance to the searing anger of songs like &quot;Exploder&quot;.  I give it a 5 out of 5!
B00007E8V4|5.0|THE FIRST SONG IS ABOUT PIZZA! HOW FREAKING GREAT IS THAT? I am a big SOAD fan ever since their self title album came out. Their music makes most other bands seem so generic and boring. Theres never a dull moment with SOAD though. Especially on this album of never released tracks and rarities. \\"F**k the System\\" is a cool agressive SOAD track while \\"Mr. Jack\\" is reminiscent of slower SOAD tracks like \\"Spiders\\" and \\"Aerials\\".<br />System of a Down is not what you want to listen to if you just want to chill out and relax. This is \\"GET THE F**K UP AND BREAK SOME SH*T\\" music. Gotta love this Stuff.<br />PLAY IT LOUD. PLAY IT LONG. AND PLEASE STEAL THIS ALBUM!!!
0066214122|5.0|I read the first part in Borders and figured I may as well by the thing.  Took it to Starbucks the next day and polished the rest off.  Crichton does not relent and takes you nonstop through the world of nanontechnology.  You are still kept guessing up until the last act, but smart readers will probably figure out what is happening before hand.  Nonetheless there are enough surprises, relevations, and crichton's signature &quot;technology excerpts&quot; to keep you going and make you feel involved and understand the nature of the technology the characters are against.<br />Highly recommended.
B000069HKH|3.0|Give Bruce credit, because let's face it, the idea of writing a rock n' roll song cycle about the aftermath of September 11th seems like an impossible challenge from the get go.  Will it be unintentionally exploitive?  Will it be maudlin?  Will it be too wrapped in the flag?  Fortunately, Bruce manages to avoid all of those traps.  However, if you're listening for one or more definitive songs that can stand with his previous songwriting triumphs, you won't find it on The Rising.  While Bruce does justice to the cause in his lyrics, too often the music and chord changes are just not very interesting.  Great songwriting is an art and a craft, and good intentions sadly do not substitute for that special combination of lyrics, melody, and arrangement. <br />Perhaps it would have been better if one of his advisors had talked him out of the song cycle concept, and encouraged him to polish up just one or two September 11 songs for inclusion on a full-length CD.  The Rising sags under the heavy weight of melancholy and introspection that rightly accompanies September 11th, but tends to smother a Bruce Springsteen/E Street CD.  And the PR for the CD, which claims that this is the first studio Springsteen/E Street band CD since 1984's Born In The USA is wrong; even 1987's Tunnel of Love was more of a band collaboration than this.  The Rising is mostly an extension of Bruce's solo period, with a few Clarence sax solos and E Street flourishes thrown in.<br />Bruce obviously still has the desire to write great songs -- why else would he try to tackle the subject matter of The Rising -- but he clearly writes best what he has lived firsthand.  Trying to speak for those who suffered in various ways in the aftermath of the horrifying terrorist attack is taking on quite a bit.  It's not that his songs do not ring true, it's that they fail to work as great songs, at least by the standard that Bruce has set.
B000066NW0|4.0|Reading the reviews of this album and you'd think it was rubbish - but it's not.  I think what has happened is that a young talented artist who hasn't quite found her niche has adopted this persona of a sk8er (yeah ok that bit sucks) as it was probably the closest image to her 'sound' - this has nothing to do with her ability to write a song, play an instrument, or perform as an artist - so lets leave the fashion criticism to Vogue.<br />I won't pretend that all the songs are fantastic, but if you relax, and enjoy the album for what it is - commercial teenage soft rock, you might find out you are in for a treat!<br />As far as the lyrics go - it's basic stuff - but it gets the point of the story over, and as in Sk8er Boi turns out to be quite an enjoyable 3 minute-odd.<br />Put simply - you like Sum41? you like Complicated by Avril? you'll love the album .... no real diversion from track to track, but enjoyable nonetheless.
0871137380|5.0|First I wanted to see the movie, but I decided to read the book first.  First when I picked up the book I thought it was going to be long and boring full with facts!  Oh boy was I wrong!! This book was more entertaining than fiction!  It was so good.  Mark Bowdin covered everything from the ground to the air.  He also put the thoughts and facts of the somalins which was good.  If you are thinking of reading this book you better do it because it is the greatest!!!!
B00006V9A0|4.0|Ok, Nirvana is the greatest band of all time if you were to ask me. I bought this CD expecting some hidden tracks that had never been released. I was a little sad when there was only one new song and the rest was just a compilation, but everyone needs a Nirvana compilation anyway, so go out and buy this CD.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This was a very good CD but not their best. It was not what I expect the follow up to Toxicity to be like. To me they sounded alot different in alot of their songs. My personal favorites on the CD were \\"Mr. Jack\\", the first four songs and the last seven. The only weakness on this CD was that they sounded alot different then normal. Still a great CD for all those System of a Down fans out there. Their self-titled album is their best. Go out and buy this CD right now.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I have read the book at least ten times so I know most of the sayings. Let me tell you there were probaly 5 sayings identical to the book. It had half edited scenes which became annoying and it added goofy scenes which made no point. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because some of the scenes were pretty cool.
0894803123|5.0|this book is a must have. it tell you all about ice cream, and ben and jerrys, and has a lot of recipes too. they have many different types of recipes, any thing from eggnog icecream, to kiwi icecream. i have tried a ton of recipes out of this book and they are all really really good. my favorite is the oreo mint.
B00000I41J|5.0|This is one of my favorite Jazz Cds of all time. The beauty of the opening lines of Autumn Leaves will just knock you out..guaranteed. Miles Davis is unbelievably cool on this recording and Cannonball's Alto solos are stunning. Sam Jones and Art Blakey provide a powerful bottom to all the cuts and the piano of Hank Jones is understated and tastefull. What an incredible performance ..every cut is a gem. Deserves 10 stars.
B000075BFK|5.0|This is definately one of Tupac/Makaveli's best albums. I've been a do or die fan ever since he dropped 2pacalypse Now, on us all like a bomb. His words are like spears that hit you in the heart, you gotta feel every lyric when you listen to his music. He may have died but he's a legend & legends never die they live Eternal in all of our hearts forever. Tupac was a true legend & his spirit will live on in the hearts of his fans forever. R.I.P Pac
B00005JKCH|5.0|This was a great movie as you probaly know. The story follows Peter Parker through his life as a genetic wonder. He made a couple stupid moves but he turned out a super hero. The only problem is the Green Goblin's suit was dumb and Peter shouldn't have turned Mary Jane down. The end fight was pretty cool to. I give this one 5 stars because this was a great movie. You will like it a lot.
B000075BFK|5.0|He's done it again! Even though he is gone, Tupac's music is still vibrant and fresh. Both albums are really good. My favorites songs are Thugz Mansion and Never Call You Bi*ch Again, but all the other songz R good too.<BR>If your a Tupac fan or just a hip-hop fan I highly recommend it.I'd say it's better than 'Until the End of Time'. Get it now<BR>!
B00006RU5B|5.0|Finally, after 8 years of grunge and rap metal wannabes, comes the best album I've ever heard. Such a bold statement from a certified music junkie may sound crazy, but this album has been the best thing that's happened to me this year. Working in music retail around the time \\"grunge\\" broke was pretty exciting. It was odd how many great bands were coming out of Seattle at the same time. Soundgarden being my favorite. Alongside all the grunge happenings, Rage Against The Machine were kicking ass on their first club tour after signing with Epic. I remember how blown away me and my friends were when we saw Rage for the first time in a small club with about 20 other people. A year or so before that, we saw Soundgarden rip it up at a sold out show in a much larger venue. Both shows are 2 of the best I ever witnessed. I remember also seeing both bands at the 96 Lollapalooza and watching them perform back to back. Little did I know that 2 of the best bands would someday converge to release the best album I've heard since Nirvana's In Utero. To me, this is a combination of the best of both bands. Most of the true Soundgarden fans refer to Badmotorfinger as the band's best. Superunknown was good, but I remember listening to it and being slightly disappointed. Good songs, not great songs. And don't even bring up Cornell's solo album. I love his voice, but I know he can do a lot better. And he has on this masterpiece. Rage's intense output was incredible, but I had to be in a certain mood to listen to them. A lot of the songs were kind of one dimensional. That's not the case on this album. I have to say that my expectations have been smashed. This is what any true fan of hard alternative music has been waiting for. When you hear this CD, you're going to really fully realize how horrible music has been the last few years. Rick Rubin has got Cornell singing his ass off, the way we all want him to, and the band rocking out like never before. Track after track is a new revelation.Most people have heard Cochise already, but it doesn't stop there. Show Me How To Live, Gasoline, Set It Off,Light My Way and Exploder, deliver the thunder you would expect from this group, but What You Are, Like A Stone, and I Am A Highway, are low key gems that stick with you for weeks. Shadow On The Sun starts softly, but finishes in a beautiful, brutal eruption. The band gets experimental with Hypnotize, but not in a bad way. Getaway Car sounds like a long, lost song from the Temple Of The Dog sessions(which is fantastic), and The Last Remaining Light is the kind cool, weird song Soundgarden always delivered. The bottom line is, there is not a bad cut on this CD, and you will be doing yourself and mankind a favor by buying it for yourself or a loved one. This is the Album Of The Year, and The Album Of A Lifetime for me.
0060012331|5.0|This is the story of Maurice, a cunning 4-year-old talking cat, and his gang of intelligent rats. Together with Keith, a stupid-looking kid who plays the flute, they travel from town to town, doing the plague-of-rats-and-rat-piper trick to earn some pocket money.<br />It works perfectly well, until the rats develop a conscience. They agree to do it one last time and head for &Uuml;berwald, or more acurately for the small village of Bad Blintz. There they soon realize that something is amiss. Food in the village is rationed, rat tails are rewarded 50p a piece and strangely, there isn't a single \\"keekee\\" (regular rat) around. Teaming up with Malicia Grim, the mayor's silly daughter who thinks she's living in a fairy tale, they are determined to uncover the mystery.<br />The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents easily stands among my favourite Discworld novels. With a story that sometimes reminded me of Mrs Friby and the Rats of NIMH and a humour echoing that of the Bromeliad, where Pratchett observes our silly human world through the eyes of other creatures, and where rats have names such as Hamnpork or Dangerous Beans because they liked the sound of it but didn't understand the meaning, it is as intelligent and sensible, sometimes scary, even sad at times, as it is hilarious. And David Wyatt's illustrations are just too cute!
B000005Z0G|5.0|While Tupac Shakur didn't hit number one on the album sales charts until 1995's Me Against the World, it was his second album, 1993's Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. that ultimately thrust the Oakland rapper into the pop world, a place the superstar would remain until his untimely death on Sept. 13, 1996, six days after being shot in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas. <br />As an album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. was heavily informed by the Public Enemy sound, a barrage of layered samples and in-your-face beats, much more so than his debut album, 2Pacalypse Now. Shortly after the release of that first album, controversy surrounded Shakur after a 6-year-old boy was killed by a bullet discharged during a fight in which the rapper was involved. <br />Despite that, Strictly yielded a couple of hits that were embraced by the mainstream. \\"I Get Around,\\" an uptempo, feel-good pop song (that was essentially a Digital Underground piece fronted by Shakur), is arguably his best single. \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\" was another crossover hit from the album and featured Shakur at his most genuine. \\"I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me/He had me thinkin' black was the thing to be,\\" he rapped. Apropos that Shakur's mother and father were Black Panthers and community activists. <br />In a bid for commercial success, Strictly was filled with guest appearances by everyone from Ice T and Ice Cube on \\"Last Wordz\\" to Treach of Naughty by Nature on \\"5 Deadly Venomz.\\" <br />1993 was a banner year for Shakur, and with Me Against the World yet to come, his career was just beginning to take off. In addition to this breakthrough, Shakur was also receiving critical praise for his role opposite Janet Jackson in John Singleton's film Poetic Justice. That Shakur proved himself to be not only a popular musician but a genuine talent as well makes his death that much more tragic.
B00006CXXU|4.0|A good album by one of the better voices world wide. OK, it's a good album, but I don't think this will be HER album. I expected more from this. Maybe I'm a bit dissapointed, I was waiting for more funky-hip hop music. There is a lot os Soul! And there is a lack of Spanish tracks...CHRISTINA!, Spanish fans need more than \\"Te quiero\\", \\"Ritmo\\" and \\"Puerto Rico\\". Please, bear in mind next time!! Thanks a lot!! <br />P.S. Listen the track called \\"GET MINE, GET YOURS\\" WHOA!, FANTASTIC!.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album is a definite must have for any hard SOAD fan or any rock fan for that matter.<BR>I didn't know what to expect when i was going to buy it until i heard it and i was totally blown out of the water.  Personally I cant get enough of these guys.  Listening to them makes me want to go punch something mainly as a result of the driving rythems and melodies, but lyrically these guys are deep and everything that they have to say is extremely and deeply heartfelt.<BR>All of the music on this was unreleased material and if i didnt hear that from someone who worked at a music store i would have had no idea at all.  <BR>I would have to say that i think that this truly is the best compilation of songs that they have
0375414053|3.0|I listened to both on tape.  However I found Nanny Diaries to be very sad, not funny at all.  This one was funny, sure she panned other women in the work force, but some of them deserved to see themselves as others saw them.  She did a fantastic job of showing how to try to juggle and not have it all work out.  I think many a working mother may just decide it isn't all worth it after all.
B000075BFK|5.0|This one must be added on the list of all his greatest works. Every word he spoke came out with lots of emphasis and the words are those you would want to hear, many rappers are missing that today. 2pac continues to show his unique mind and how he has mastered aspects of human life. Great Work Pac![.]
6305265666|5.0|Of all the Cinderella movies I have seen this is the best.<br />Drew is very captivating and charming as Cinderella, but Anjelica is marvellous as her stepmother!!! I really enjoyed this movie. <br />If you like Cinderella story, you MUST buy this one. You will not regret. The very best version of the Cinderella story ever. I recommend.
B00005ASOC|3.0|I agree with most of the praise AND insults below.<br />This is a highly enjoyable film, very well made. Great sets, acting, music. But it's also highly manipulative -- a paint-by-number Hollywood tearjerker, full of cliches, that pushses all the buttons.<br />Have you seen the trailer? Then you know EVERYTHING in this film. The trailer told the ENTIRE STORY, including how it ended (so many trailers do that, it seems).<br />Here's what you get from the trailer: A black teen genius in the ghetto befriends a reclusive white writer. Writer teaches the teen in return for keeping his secret -- where he's living. Proving his mettle, the teen gets transfered to a rich white school, then he gets stereotyped, and falsely accused of plagiarism by a somewhat racist teacher. Looks like he's done for. But then the white writer gains courage (through the teen's help) to leave his shell, and vindicates the teen genius to much applause. Break out the hankies.<br />It was all in the trailer -- the entire film -- all 136 minutes of it.<br />This is also one of those films that can't decide on an ending. It \\"ends\\" several times. You think, okay, that's it. But new endings keep getting tacked on. Like the director couldn't settle on an ending, and so uses them all, each meriting still more tears.<br />I disagree with some of the below remarks that this breaks some stereotypes. The smart black ghetto kid, vicimtized by a racist \\"system\\", has been a cliche since the 1960s.<br />Still, I enjoyed the film. Like E.T., you know the whole story going in, but it's so well made you still like it.<br />PS: There's a MAJOR BLOOPER in this film.  The teen is told that if his copying was with Forrester's permission, that that \\"would be different.\\"  NOT!  If he had Forrester's permission, if would not be copyright infringement -- it would STILL be plagiarism.  Think about it.  If you buy a term paper from someone, and hand it in as your own, you have the author's permission -- but it's STILL plagiarism, no?<br />I wonder if the filmmaker didn't know this, or did but hoped that the audience would miss it.arism, no?  <br />I wonder if the filmmaker didn't know this, or did but hoped that the audience would miss it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I am buying this on half.com, but I think I might just call in sick for Thanksgiving tomorrow, rent it, and stay home and watch it again. I can't wait 5 days for it to come in the mail!!<BR>I am a bit frightened by how much I loved this film. I don't rent movies very frequently, and heard about this movie on a listserv. I vaguely remember when it came out, but it seems like there was other stuff going on around that time ...<BR>Set in 1988, an obvious adoration for Sam Raimi's \\"Evil Dead\\" is apparent throughout Donnie Darko, from the eerily similar skin-crawling mood to the obvious hat-tip when Donnie takes his girlfriend to see \\"Evil Dead\\" at the movies.<BR>Donnie is forced to endure one ordeal after another by Frank, a demonic man-sized rabbit that torments him and controls his life. Frank saves Donnie's life early in the film by appearing to him in a vision, leading him out of his house, and warning him of the end of the world, which will happen in approximately 6 days. Shortly thereafter, Frank compels Donnie to commit a series of destructive crimes, including vandalism and arson. The repurcussions of these evil acts eventually completely destroy Donnie's sanity.<BR>I have read others say they were confused by the ending, but I think the ending makes perfect sense. Sometimes there are worse fates than death.<BR>The deleted scenes of \\"Watership Down\\" add a literary level to the movie, but the movie does just as well without them. <BR>Those interested in time travel, theoretical physics, the space-time continuum, horror movies, schizophrenia and related psychological conditions, updates on themes from classic movies, love stories with unhappy endings, apocalyptic visions, 80s music, and twisted black humor will LOVE this movie.
B00006JL1Z|3.0|Great to have many of the songs finally remastered, but I question why a couple of &quot;single edits&quot; were used instead of the full-length album cut, especially for &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and &quot;Over My Head&quot;.  And the way the &quot;live&quot; cuts were picked had me puzzled:<BR>a live version of &quot;Big Love&quot; was included (instead of the hit version off &quot;Tango In The Night&quot;), yet the live version of &quot;Silver Springs&quot; from &quot;The Dance&quot;, which had huge radio play, was passed over for the version from &quot;25 Years - The Chain&quot;.  Still, it's great to hear songs like &quot;Songbird&quot; and &quot;The Chain&quot; remastered.  Now if the label would only release remastered versions of &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; and &quot;Rumours&quot;.
B00003CWOL|5.0|The reactions this film gets has always amused me. Devout Catholics declare it is insulting, and blasphemous. If they would simply take a minute to LISTEN to the message Kevin Smith is trying to bring forward, they would find themselves sorely mistaken. He himself was born and raised a Catholic. He knows what he's talking about. I had to laugh watching this film because I have never before seen a motion picture that dares to be this blunt. It is crude at times (Particularly where the Prophets are involved) but how many pot head post-teens aren't crude? It's REALISTIC. Everything they say in this movie is so startlingly bold, and blunt, but above all true. Religion should not be about stipulations, and restrictions. It should be about faith. As Serendipity says...<BR>&quot;You people don't celebrate your faith. You mourn it.&quot;
B000002VMD|4.0|Ain't it funny? This CD hit the spot and the mark where her previous studio album failed.<BR>It was indeed word of mouth due to the movie, but you must admit that most of the material provided by Whitney is far superior than the one she cut for I'M YOUR BABY TONIGHT.<BR>And she only sings 6 tunes on this one...<BR>I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU started the whole commotion, reaching # 1 and spending time there as one of the most longeve hits.<BR>The David Foster production is impeccable.<BR>I feel quite strong in saying this has become since then Whitney's signature song.<BR>The cover of Chaka's I'M EVERY WOMAN is updated to the '90's thanks to Clivilles/Cole supervision, and has become another dancefloor fav.<BR>QUEEN OF THE NIGHT is produced by Babyface and brings out the rock side of Nippy.<BR>Lisa Stansfield, Kenny G. &amp; Aaron Neville and Curtis Stiger contribute with other nuggets.<BR>A great original soundtrack album.
B000001E18|3.0|As anyone will tell you, this album represents U2's \\"experimental\\" period of the early nineties. Unfortunately, the thing about experiments is that they may succeed or they may fail, and while Zooropa contains some of the best material U2 have ever done, it also contains some of their worst, making Zooropa a frustratingly uneven effort. On the plus side, there're two achingly beautiful ballads, \\"Stay\\" and \\"The First Time\\", hilarious \\"Numb\\", excellent \\"Lemon\\" and a mildly interesting opening track. On the minus side, there's boring mediocre ... like \\"Some Days Are Better Than Others\\" and \\"Babyface\\", and \\"Wanderer\\", which has great lyrics and Johnny Cash on vocals but sounds more like a lame karaoke cover than anything else. \\"Dirty Day\\" and \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car\\" sounded great when played live on ZooTV tour, but here they're somewhat let down by a dry, lifeless production. So basically it's a fifty-fifty split between hits and misses, but I still give it three stars just because the good stuff is really excellent.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is by far my favorite band, and this cd is just a perfect reason why.  Every song is PERFECT!!  The best song of the whole cd is Eulogy.  I can listen to this cd numerous times in a row and never get tired of it.  Maynard is a master of vocalists.  The instramentals are teriffic.  I can't fully express the bliss involved in listening to this cd.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album can only be described in one word, \\"Amazing.\\" She co-wrote & produced 14 songs and expresses herself as deeply as possible. \\"Stripped\\", truly is a reflection of Christina Aguilera. Every song has its own touch and feel to it, not like most cliche albums where there may only be two songs that would stick out and the rest which all sound the same; NO! this is different each song has it's own lesson to learn and story to tell. Like most reviewers each customer had a very special place in their hearts for the tear-jerking ballad \\"Beautiful\\" in which the song title does truly describe itself. The fast moving pop-oriented, \\"Loving Me For Me\\" shows off her spice girl, butt kicking, girl-power intellect and tells the world, \\"BACK OFF WORLD IM A GIRL AND I LOVE ME 4 ME.\\" We all as well know the sheer dirtyness of the debut single of ,\\"Dirrty.\\" She truly outdid herself wth this album especially with her soulful tune with Alicia Keys, \\"Impossible\\". But don't listen to what I say the tracks that I described are not even 10% of how good this sophomore LP is. Get this album and don't mis-judge what others say; oh yeah! Kelly Osbourne girl you really need to stop dissing Christina so please SHUT UP!
0375414053|5.0|It was my life, and the insane life of most of my friends (only looking ten times as good and making 100 times more money)!  Only pre-partum militant feminists (and men) wouldn't understand it - the rest of us have deal with our own Momfia, judgemental coworkers, and Motherhood Court every day.  It was such a relief to see someone else, in another country, living through the same nonsense.  The Cinderella ending was a bit of a shock, but darn it, that is what escapist fiction is for - I wanted her to succeed and escape even more because I know I can't.  No working woman should have kids without reading this book - not that it will help, but at least they'll get fair warning.
B00006LI4D|5.0|Ray Brown and Jazz Alley in Seattle had a fine tradition. Ray would come in every year for two consecutive weeks and have a different group each week. One week it might be SuperBass with Ray, John Clayton and Christian McBride and the next it might be as it was last year Ray with Monty Alexander and Russell Malone. It was, unfortunately his last appearance which featured the latter group. Ray was his amazing self, Russell Malone, a brilliant guitarist with a clear understanding and appreciation for the jazz guitar's R&amp;B and BeBop roots (listen to his version of &quot;At Last&quot; on a Houston Person CD and you will hear the R&amp;B roots in spades!), and Monty Alexander, whom I had recently enjoyed with his group on a QEII cruise to England, was the ideal accompaniment. This was, in my mind, the best group Brown had ever brought in to Jazz Alley. Keep in mind previous groups featured Geoff Keezer, Stanley Turrentine, Larry Fuller, Jeff Hamilton, Kevin Mahogany and the &quot;Sermon-like improvisations on every solo&quot; of Gene Harris. I haven't heard this CD yet, but I am sure it will be one of my great treasured memories of Ray Brown, Russell Malone and Monty Alexander.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave have finally released the long awaited &quot;stunning&quot; album.<br />The articulated torent of hard-core rock accompanied by the melodic and astounding vocal capablities of Chris Cornell.<br />A must for anyone with taste...<br />:o)
6302642256|5.0|The movie is great!  My dog is the Black labrador, the one catching frisbee in the beginning of the movie.  His name was Ben.  He placed fifth in the world at the Gaines Frisbee Dog competition.  He was hit by a car the next year.  He was an amazing animal. This is the only footage we have of him.<br />Great movie!
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is a very good album and has great songs on it. It's the sound of Rage mixed with the voice of Soundgarden. These 2 forces make an incredible duo in there new debut. This is a great buy for rock fans. You won't regret it!
B00004TR2G|5.0|Although John Williams had been making inroads in the movie/television musical composition biz, it was his score to the Spielberg classic that cemented his status as one of the best in the field.<br />A landmark album, &quot;Jaws&quot; possesses what is, without a doubt, the most ominous and thrilling trio of notes in motion picture history.  This release on the 25th anniversary of the film is a treasure for music fans, as well as lovers of the cinema.
B00006RU5B|5.0|With the amazing riffs of Tom Morello and the mind blowing vocals from Chris Cornell this album easily gets album of the year from me.  Audioslave also mixes in that bluesy classic rock sound that I haven't heard since I bought Aerosmiths:Get Your Wings.  Missing out on this album really is missing out on a true masterpiece that was perfectly done.
B00005JK8K|1.0|I hate to be so cynical, but does it bother anybody other than me that one of the few recognized mainstream contributions to modern U.S. culture by a native American group has just been hijacked by Hollywood? Why did they have to make the star a caucasian? When I saw the trailers, I almost walked out of the movie.  Then I realized that I hadn't come to see Windtalkers, but was about to see a moderately thoughtful movie.  Spend your money elsewhere.
0679720200|5.0|I took upon myself to read L'etranger(that's French for those in the unaware) after seeing the glowing recommendations of others on Amazon and countless people listing it prominently in their Listmania lists. I had read similar books containing a highly disenchanted and disjointed protagonist such as A Clockwork Orange and Fight Club(both excellent works). However, The Stranger, albeit a short work, adds more fuel to the fire of disillusionment in the person of the enigmatic and mysterious Meursault. Camus galvanizes this novella noir with his uncanny use of existentialism to bring attention to the smells, sights, and sounds of the beach and the countryside and Meursault's oneness with nature and conversely his nothingness with God.<br />The Stranger proves incredibly unconventional and simple, yet paradoxically complex and compelling. There are times when I wanted to shake the catatonic Meursault and shout, \\"Wake up!!\\" It seems as if he's almost stoically sleepwalking through life and his highly questionable decisions. He proves totally devoid of conscience and emotion - enigmatic and remorseless to the end. Worth a read - unlike any other work of fiction you will ever read.
0425098478|5.0|The One Minute Manager is a book that MUST be read by anyone on the payroll of a fortune 500 company -- especially since there are more than 7 million copies in print.  But is it really worth five stars?  Well, let's see...<br />Published in 1980, the One Minute Manager is the story of a hypothetical manager and his hypothetical employees, being interviewed by a hypothetical interviewer who is out to learn how to become a better manager.  Through the interviewing process, the interviewer uncovers that the One Minute Manager has developed a three legged process for managing *the behaviours* of working adults.  Specifically, the three main components of the One Minute Manager process are:<BR>1) One Minute Goal Setting<BR>2) One Minute Praisings<BR>3) One Minute Reprimands<br />Throughout the book, the One Minute Manager and his employees frequently use metaphors to clarify the why's and wherefores of the One Minute Manager process and its value-add to an organization.  Shockingly, most of the examples used to clarify the value of the process draw on behaviour modifcation techniques used on animals (in the book: a whale, a pigeon, and a puppy), recalcitrant children and even a terminally ill alcoholic.  Not exactly the types of paragons I am trying to emulate in my professional life.<br />The real problem with the One Minute Manager is that the authors, Blanchard and Johnson, evidently believe that a reasonable way to develop a process for managing people is to venture out to the extremes in finding test cases for how best to change behaviour.  And in theory, this can work.   But in the One Minute Manager the process breaks down in most real-world situations because the One Minute Manager process *requires* a binary world (i.e., black/white, off/on, correct/incorrect).  Especially for the One Minute Praisings Praisings and Reprimands -- my experience in the complex world of modern business, is that there frequently does not exist one right way to do things and that good/bad, better/worse, and best/worst cases are often not uncovered or agreed upon for years (example: Time Warner &amp; AOL merger).<br />What is good about the book is that Blanchard and Johnson have marketed a process that neccesitates engaging both manager and employee in objective setting and driving the success of the business (very TQM/Deming of them).  They also encourage folks to praise themselves -- something I have found that many do not do in the workplace.  The most poignant part of the story uses the following joke very effectively (paraphrased): &quot;If you don't blow your own horn sometimes, eventually someone will use it for a spit-toon&quot;.<br />So given the above, why the five stars?  Well, there are three reasons for this:<BR>1) The One Minute Manager is unique in the business book genre in that it employees a parable (i.e., no new data or primary research) to put forward ideas/concepts for managing people -- somewhat strange that two *supposed* scientists would take this approach<BR>2) I have personally been an employee of someone who, while I worked for her, became a One Minute Manager by reading the book (this manager overcame her mere average incompetence and quickly became ludicrously incompetent), so realize that in the wrong hands, this book can make the lives of employees a nightmare<BR>3) Too many folks in business have bought the book for you not to<br />Net/net: FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED.  Read this and know what other corporate types know if you rely on your paycheck for shelter and food, and have even the slightest interest in being happy and succeeding in corporate America.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Hey all you &quot;Rage&quot; and &quot;Soundgarden&quot; fans.  So there is life after break up.  If any of you hardcore fans are looking for a &quot;Rage against the Machine&quot; or &quot;Soundgarden&quot; alternative then you are looking in the wrong spot.  However if you are looking for hard, rocking, bottom line good music then look no further.  Tom Morello still offers up hard biting licks and Cornell offers up his sultry and sensual revved up voice.  All in all it wasn't what i expected, but in that sense....I'm glad.

B00005MAM2|5.0|Make no mistake. \\"Akira\\" is the first great anime known in the Western World. Wired Magazine included it in a list they made of the 20 greatest sci-fi movies of all time and you can definitely see why. It was, at the time, not just a great story that made live-action cinema jealous, it also was a milestone in technical merits, merging for the first time the purest Japanese tradition with some western accomplishments in animation. This two-disc edition is also the one you need to get. Finally, with re-mastered sound in THX, you can feel the pure pleasure of just kicking back and listening to that amazing soundtrack. It also has some very good (although old) documentaries about the whole making-of process. The \\"glossary\\" option is highly recommended for those who are not familiar with the story, and for all of you aspiring animators out there, there are literally tons of sketches and original drawings from the creators. As for the language, I strongly recommend skipping the English-dubbed version, which is very lame. The best option is to hear the movie in the original Japanese soundtrack and putting on some English Subtitles. By the way, how about throwing in some Spanish subtitles as well the next time? I'm seriously thinking about starting a crusade in favor of language diversity for Region 1.<br />In conclusion, you can't call yourself an anime fan if you haven't seen this one. I'm by no means an expert on the genre, but I certainly know that \\"Akira\\" is an ineludible reference. As for the edition, it's clearly the best one available. Maybe it could've had more stuff considering the fact that it takes two discs, but the image and sound quality will definitely blow you away. See (and listen) for yourself.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I preordered this cd before it came out with a little hesitation as I hoped it would not be a posthumous second rate album designed to lure fans in.  I was not disappointed.  It is stunning, easily on a par with All Things Must Pass.  Listening to it both elates and saddens me as the music is so moving which makes the loss so much harder.  Thank you George for this wonderful gift to the world.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This truly is one of Christina's best work. Not even her first cd could compare to this one. This one has much more heart and soul put into it. While \\"Dirrty\\" might of been a bad first single, \\"Beautiful\\" shows what this album is really like. From the song \\"Fighter\\" to \\"Beautiful\\" to \\"The Voice Within\\" to \\"Infatuation\\", Christina shows a variety of vocals. Some are wonderful ballads guarenteed to cheer you up if you're in a bad mood. Some are ones that you could just dance to. Christina is nooooooooooo comparsion to Britney. Christina has a better voice along with better lyrics. While she might dress a little...trashy, this cd is nothing like her image. This is a great gift for anyone, including yourself. Christina deserved her Best New Artist Grammy in 2oo2 and she totally deserves a Grammy for this cd. After all, if Alicia Keys, who has major talent, dueted with Christina, well doesn't that prove this cd is worth listening to?
B00005QG9J|5.0|I urge anyone to purchase this album. yes, it is a step down from the previous work incubus has done, but it is still amazing. this cd has become more mellow then preceeding make yourself and SCIENCE, but any band can slow down and take it easy. heh, maybe living in Hawaii has something to do with it. cd starts with nice to know you, which is quick slow, quick slow, and then comes circles which is pure drop d ecstacy, along with some celtic instruments. wish you were here is a great song and reminds one of the ocean and accurately depicts it too. just a phase has a crazy long intro and then beautiful lyrics. 11am is a nice, slow reminiscent song. blood on the ground has resonance of anger oozing out of it, and the flow of the song is fantastic. mexico is an acoustic song, not really appealing. warning shows the skill of DJing, guitar, singing, and writing all in one. echo is one of the most beautiful love songs ever written. have you ever is a faster, more metal sounding song. are you in has a kind of house sound to it, something to chill out to. under my umbrella is quick and witty. aqueous transmission has an eastern oriental sound to it with many instruments from that region and also celtic. very unorthodox. but very peaceful. overall, morning view is a great cd and makes a great gift!

0553579908|5.0|If I were a king in a time long ago and there was an author with the genius of George R.R. Martin he would be required to write and present something to me everyday. The man is brillant! I have never read a series so realistic and enjoyable as this one. It's kind of sad when you get finished because you know there are no books out there that really even come close to this man's tale. And it takes him two years to write one of these large novels. Well let me say no more about that and go into the content and what makes this second installment just as good, perhaps even better than The Game. If you are looking for books to hold you in the wait for the next George R.R. Martin novel I recommend the following: Any book by Ms. Robin Hobb, (the books are excellent) The Hedge Knight found in the book 'Legends' (this is a short novella about a hundred years before a the events that take place in a game of thrones). Any book by Tad Williams. These books are the most closely related to A Song of Ice and Fire.<br />On The Content:<br />A Clash of Kings starts right where The Game left off of course. It is longer and just as good as the last installment with new and interesting characters like Theon to make up for those characters who got the block in the last book. And no one is safe from it in this book either. Who will get it? And the title lives up to its name too. The kings do clash in a very nice battle at the end that is just one of many things Martin weaves into this tale. I do not want to spoil anything for those of you who may not have read this yet. That would be a cruel thing indeed. A must read as are all the books in A Song of Ice and Fire. The only bad thing is will Martin ever finsih the tale...?

B00006RU5B|5.0|With the ultimate band ,Rage Against the Machine, splitting there was no hope for music to reach the hight that rage delivered ever again.  If you buy Audioslaves self titled debue album you will recieve the same thrills of Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk with a suprisingly fitting vocal experience by Chris Cornell.  The legend of Zack De La Rocka will never be beaten but upon hearing Audioslave there is no other band that could even compete.  If the rating could go up to 20, 30, 40 stars Audioslave would get the 40 and any other band would sruggle to reach 10.<BR>    BUY THIS ALBUM
B00006RU5B|5.0|Awesome is the only way to describe this record. They start things off right with Cochise, the first single off of the album. Other than that, major highlights are Like A Stone(Great song with a great guitar solo), Bring Em Back Alive, Light My Way, I Am The Highway and Getaway Car. Every song on the record is great, but those are personal favorites. This CD is a MUST HAVE.
B000002JKA|5.0|I first got this album when I was 16 years old (21 now). I listened the first 15 mins. and put it away for about a year. I couldn't accept what I heard, wasn't ready for it, but that all changed a year later when I really gave 6:00 and Caught In A Web proper listens. Instantly hooked from Mike's signature 6:00 opening. Erotomania will blow your mind, this should be textbook for time changes and chord progression. I've not heard anything like it since. Lifting Shadows has perhaps the strongest Labrie vocals (not in pitch and volume, but in control). I think James is a fantastic singer. Some might complain he falters but that's human you know? His voice is the DT voice, gentle yet capable of those Halford yells. I concur that Awake is their heaviest album but that's not a bad thing, is it? The only low point of Awake would be the meandering Space-Dye Vest. <BR>Indeed Images had it's moments in Another Day and my all-time favourite DT song, Surrounded, but on the whole this album is more BALANCED. Their most popular, Pull Me Under, was in my opinion mediocre (by DT standards) DT is SO together here. You have some people saying DT overdo it on the technical side, ignoring the song, that's ... DT albums are showcases of superb songwriting. They are songs that you can hum along to, right? It takes years of unimaginable practice and certain amount of talent to reach such standards, and if hard work is a fault, well.... the only people who hate solos are those who can't OK? Shredding is an art, but you have some people try to compensate incompetence with 'feel' or something ridiculous like that. \\"Oh, Malmsteen's a poseur, I dig the guy from Creed, now he's got feel.\\" (??!!) A guy who runs a marathon can also run 100 meters, but not the other way around. Dream Theater is made up of SUPERIOR musicians, that is what they do, if they sound like they're showing off, it's because they CAN.<BR>Is there anything DT plays that they don't sound like experts? Rock/metal/jazz/blues/classical...been there done that, and with the BEST of them. I mean they play Metallica better than Metallica did. Dig JP's jam with Steve Howe. JP is easily the best rock guitarist in the world today, both technically and creatively. Unlike most others, he actually knows how to put his 7th string to proper use. Those who disagree are probably still mourning the loss of guitar wizard Kurt Cobain. DT also turned me on to Queensryche and King's X, two other incredible groups. OK for newbies to DT (it's never too late) BUY this album, then get 6DOIT and Scenes From a Memory. Each album has something different to offer, and that's been said a million times but you'll believe it when you hear it. Though if you dig Linkin Park, or Limp Bizkit, or some nu-metal...then don't bother.
B00005JKCH|2.0|I can't get over how bad this movie is, and I know this is the last time I give one of these re-hashed Marvel guys a break.<br />One more long, significant pause as Toby wetly contemplates his boring new powers. Another cringing romantic moment. Yet another wet look from Toby. Wow! Really awful animation!<br />I think it would help if you were seriously drunk, since the action won't look so terrible, and you'll simply sleep through the rest. I, however, was almost sober.
B00004XMSN|4.0|There are as of today 42 reviews here of THE BISHOP'S WIFE, and while all rightly speak of the glowing warmth of this confection of whimsy, it should also be noted that other elements besides the simple story line contribute to its success. While it does feature Christmas scenes, they are not essential to the story, but merely a marketing ploy by the maker to increase theatre attendance and box office sales in what was normally a slower time of attendance.<br />The warmth and quiet joy that so pervades the movie is due not only to fine acting, excellent direction, and lavish yet fitting sets, but also to an inspired musical score. The casting of an Angel to come to earth and help an Episcopal Bishop to ostensibly build a cathedral when funds are short, could not have been better than the one and only Cary Grant. His natural urbanity, and suave good looks and demeanor were perfect for the role. The character of 'Dudly' had to walk a narrow line between earnestness and a perfunctory fulfilling of duties and Mr. Grant easily found the exact blend of dignity with warmth. The rest of the cast is up to his caliber with David Niven the starchy Bishop, Loretta Young as the neglected wife of the title, and a first rate supporting cast, including such scene stealers as Monty Wolley as the Professor.<br />Fantasies of this type require a very deft and light hand in order not to become maudlin and saccharine, nor so light as to have no substance. This film does have several layers of thought and director Henry Koster must be given the lion's share of credit for this. While there were five men involved in the original script and rewrites, it is the director who must primarily account for the tone of a film, and the tone here is bright and ennobling.<br />Composer Hugo Friedhofer is perhaps the second person most responsible for the overall cohesiveness of the theme as he creates lovely melodies to compliment the various scenes. The main theme with the credits and especially thatwonderfully exuberant yet polite theme for the ice skating scene are works of art in themselves and stand well along side the 'inspired' singing of the perfect harmony of the Mitchell Boy Choir in the church scene. Such 'heavenly' tones would be impossible to form in a boy's choir today in our crass day and age. It is amazing to see how much social attitudes have changed in just the short time since 1947, of which this film is a sort of time capsule. <br />Often overlooked by the audience are the settings for the players since, like the background music, they are not supposed to intrude upon the story and actors. Here we have a wonderful set of designs, especially of the interiors, which often include ceilings in view, so that we believe that the story is taking place where intended. The fine atmosphere created of gray winter days is wonderfully offset by the lighthearted designs used in the outdoor scenes, especially the skating pond in the park. The romance of the setting even in the cold of winter causes an easy suspension of disbelief, as we must note that doubles are used for our principals while skating. Today you would have canned Rock-N-Roll with deafening amplification rather than a popular band. Instead of 'Sylvester' the cabby filled with warmth and gratitude for the beneficence of the Angel and the Bishop's wife, we find bullet-proof barriers and surly drivers.<br />While it is nice to credit Cary Grant with the bearing of an Angel, the Biblical fact remains that no angel is recorded to have visited man in fleshly form since the Bible was completed, for that inspired Word of God is what is intended to guide us today. And it is an offense to Angels to portray them as so \\"not cold and not hot\\" as to imply their being incomplete, wandering, lonely creatures for whom we should have sympathy. Loretta Young was a beautiful woman, but no true Angel since after the Great Flood of Noah's day would consider ever envying a mortal or coveting his wife. This stratagem is used to create a false 'love' story in the plot to create the title character and to attract those given to the personality cult then surrounding Miss Young. This contrivance at odds with fact was created as a marketing tool to appeal to the ladies, and not with regard to Scriptural accuracy. The fact that while Jesus' birth is recorded in the Bible, but nothing like Christmas is ever mentioned there, further shows that the movie is intended as a fantasy and should be viewed only on that level. Thus the church represented in the film does not represent the accurate message of the Bible, even as the \\"Shepherd's Song\\" scene and the mention of Sylvester's descendents \\"rising up and calling him Blessed\\" is a warping of the true context of the Holy Scriptures.<br />This film is the more remarkable today in that there are no creations anything like it (save for a sad remake), and due to the disintegration of the moral fiber of our society, there will never be any things like it in this System of Things. God wants our days to be happy and gay in the original meaning of that word, and not with the corrupted meanings so prevalent today. Watch the film for the contentment it leaves you as you envy our forebears the more innocent and at least Godly-oriented lives they cold then enjoy. During the Great Resurrection to come we will be able to welcome back to a restored Paradise Earth all the people who made this delightful film into a world then having the genuine, noncommercial atmosphere that our loving God intends for us. Seen in this light, this film is an unintentional foreshadow of some things to come!
B000063UR1|4.0|It's a Nice film. The new edition DVD is a big improvement. Some of the commentary is very interesting, as there's a lot more to talk about in the way each shot is made with old optical effects, rather than saying \\"Here's Joe; he and this computer here is how we made the whole movie\\".<br />The other content is a bit light.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I am a huge Rage Against the Machine fan, and was extremely disappointed that Zack de la Rocha left.  I was then happy to find out that they were continuing with Audioslave.  Honestly, I didn't care how Chris Cornell sang because I was in it for Tom Morello.  I have to say the guy is the most talented guitarist in the business.  He can do friggin anything with his guitar.  As always there is the assurance that all sounds were made with drums, bass, guitar, and vocals.  So I was also hoping he didn't go all soft.  Well, he didn't and his style is still there and doing great!  Plus, I got the added bonus that Cornell is good also!  So take it from an RATM fan that has never listened to Soundgarden - this album is great and there is nothing to be apprehensive of.  Every track is good with its own unique style, but still blends in with the rest of the tracks.  So just buy this cd.
B000075BFK|5.0|Honestly, this is the best album of unreleased material that has been released since his death. This album is a cross between Me Against the World and All Eyez On Me. It carries the same variety as AEOM. But it offers the same depth and heart-felt vibes as MATW. And, not to mention, it is great for the price. Keep in mind that this is a double album. I must mention that 3 songs on this album have been released on soundtracks (but you probably don't own those soundtracks no way.) And 2 songs are remixed (they appear twice on the album). So you still get 20 'unique' unreleased songs for your money. I definately recommend this album if you are a Tupac fan. If not, I suggest you pick up '2Pacalypse Now' and 'Me Against the World' to really get to know 'him' first. Regardless of what ANY other reviewer says, Tupac, you definately get 5 stars from me. What other man on Earth can die and produce this much UNRELEASED MATERIAL (6 albums, including 3 double albums)? You will live forever through my soul!!!
B00006RU5B|4.0|I had bought this album 2 weeks ago. And the first time Î listend i didn't really liked it. Because I was a RATM fan, and because of that I missed the sound of Zack's voice. <BR>But when i listend it a couple of times. I was beginning to appriciate it.<BR>The first 10 numbers are great and it was as an explosion to my Stereo and then the last numbers were verry soft and I am still disliking that part of the cd. <BR>But the Solo parts of Tom morrelo are the best and that makes the cd a masterpiece. It is good that Chris Cornell didnot picked up his gitar and played it in the band, because he can´t play guitar as good as Tom. But his voice is beatifull to listen too.<br />Conclusion: Its an Verry Verry Verry good album. But i think if they are playing a couple of years together they can do better.
B00007E8V4|5.0|First of let me warn you System will not be touring for this album(let us all take a second and mourn). This is a really good CD. It's not as good as Toxicity but it's better than the self-titled debut. Some of the songs are a lot eaisier to figure out but some are just plain wierd(Chic'N'Stu) but who ever said weird was a bad thing.<BR>Chic'N'Stu-The strangest song I've ever heard. Serj keeps going on about pizza. \\" Pizza Pizza Pie \\". But who knows it could be about advertisment causing therapy?<br />Innervision-Starts out good and heavy. It may be about finding what's really inside you or the government.<br />Bubbles-Another song that starts out good and heavy. Something about a power struggle. Good song.<br />Boom!-Very political song(about bombs.Kinda agree with them .). You can tell very easily. The song starts out with Serj(or Daron) speaking. Also talks about trying to find to find a way to peace.<br />Nuguns-Pretty good song.Maybe about Armenian genocide?<br />A.D.D.-Also known as American Dream Denial. Mostly about war.<br />Mr.Jack-Awsome song!Starts out slow but is still cool.<br />I-E-A-I-A-I-O-Best song on the CD. The song title is just the soud of the chorus. Cool screams. Serj makes this weird sound that will crack you up every single time you hear it even though it's supposed to be serious.<br />36-Very short song. I mean really fast. Pretty cool.It's 0:46 seconds long. about telivision.<br />Pictures-Pretty Mid-Eastern sounding. Serj goes \\" Ba Ba Ba Baa\\".<BR>What does it mean?<br />Highway Song-Second best on album. Kinda slow in begining.<br />**** the System- Awsome song. Can't write out song title not aloud. Serj again is making insane noises.<br />Ego Brain-Starts out acoustic. Pretty cool<br />Thetawaves-Really cool song. Pretty fast singing.<br />Roulette-Increadable! All of it is just acoustic guitar with vocals. Really cool meaning. Makes you want it never to stop.I'm serious this song is breathtaking.<br />Streamline-Was on Scorpion King Soundtrack. Pretty cool, nothing to brag about.<br />   This is an awsome CD. Go out and buy it if you want something to hold you of until the new one comes out. Keep on rocking.

But seriously, this is the way you can enjoy the live version of Journey.  My contention is that most people who don't like Journey either lack the taste for good rock and roll or they have never heard the band live.  The latter think that Journey did a few songs which the don't get or like.  But once you hear this DVD you could change your mind.  As for the Journey faithful, I don't have to tell you that you want this DVD.  You already know that.

B00006LSM3|5.0|George Harrison's posthumous `Brainwashed' is, simply, a truly fantastic album. After his death, the album was finally put together by long-time friend Jeff Lynne and George's son Dhani. They have also done a brilliant job.<br />`Brainwashed' mainly consists of very Georgish, melodic and bright pop songs. It also offers some folk traditions and a touch of blues. Despite of his difficult illness, George's voice sounds amazingly good on the album. His slide guitar is at its best, too. <br />`Any Road', `Stuck Inside a Cloud' and `Rising Sun' are the elite of the pop material whilst `Vatican Blues' is nothing short of a blissful three-chord tune. `Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea' is pure folk fun. Although there are as many as twelve songs on the album, only `Run so Far' lacks top musical quality.<br />The title track is a chapter in itself. Differing from the other - mostly positive - songs on the album, `Brainwashed' is an angry cry against the world's madness. It is about how the world and today's societies destroy people's natural creativity and make them run after fame and fortune. Altering the people's minds starts in the childhood, continues at school and goes on and on. Whereas love, warmth and friendship would be all that a human being needs, they are left with holy idols like Dow Jones, Nikkei and Footsie. The rest of George's message is coded into a 3-minute Krishna prayer in the end of the song.<br />Although this is an album made by a dying man, it is hard to find bitterness in the music. But he does refer to `Bullshit Avenue' in the title song. By this he probably means the sidetrack, onto which people are directed by the money-stimulated societies. After all, it is relieving to feel that George had peace of mind and he left the material world in a brave fashion.<br />George Harrison may have disappeared from the physical reality, but he will always be with us through his music. `Brainwashed' is a great remedy, should you suffer from missing him.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This CD has not left my CD player since I bought it. The combination of two of the best bands of the last 10 years is an absolute dream. The sound is familiar yet completely different to RATM and Soundgarden's individual output and it completely blows the competition away. If you are one of those people that think the Backstreet Boys are talented, listen to this to hear what a non-manufactured band sounds like and come to the conclusion that there's currently no band out there (except perhaps U2, Foo Fighters and Red Hot Chilli Peppers) who come even close to matching the musical quality of this fantastic new band. Let's hope there's many more albums to follow.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Great rock album  with a great sound  can't wait for lives !!!!

B00004ZAV3|3.0|But unfortunately, there are some painful exclusions. &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; anyone?? In my opinion, if you wanted to release a 'best-of' compilation by the Beatles, you'd have to release them like they did with the Red album and the Blue album of the early 1970s, but that would seem kind of pointless. <BR><BR>This CD is filled with great songs, but overall it's a cash cow.
0066620996|5.0|In times of economy downturn and falling quarterly profit, reducing workforce and defaulting inventories seem to be a quick answer to restore corporate health. Unfortunately, they often destroy the weak foundations on which many corporations are built today. The advices and rescue efforts from management gurus often fail to work. This leads one to wonder if there are better solutions. And there are. According to Mr. Collins and his research team, companies who make the leap from good to great can survive and even prosper during tough times. <br />The research findings are so simple that one may find them hard to swallow. But that's precisely the point. One of the most powerful formula in the world is not a complex integral but a simple equation: E=MC2. <br />I think the findings are best represented as a framework for businesses to operate. They enable business owners and managers to analyze both the financial and humanistic aspects of their business. Making money is important but we all know it's not the only reason why we are in business. Passion, customer values,  social contribution, etc. are some additional forces. This book helps to link them together and allow the organization to make the transformation from good to great.<br />What is lacking is specific techiques to practice the framework/principles. However, there are plenty of books and management gurus out there who can help. It will be up to the readers to select and use what work for them. This book is not an answer for all but only for those who want to become great!
B00007E8V4|5.0|ok, i just bought this cd yesterday and after listening to it about 15 times, i'm still anxious to listen to over and over again. This is definitely the best SOAD cd out yet, because there is so much variety, because the songs are songs that didnt make it one the first 2 cds, so the results are, crazy, catchy tunes, and a couple slow and even acoustic tracks. I had to laugh some at the lyrics, and the high pitches of Malakians voice.Also, there seems to be alot more types of guitars used in this and it sounds really good, even my dad liked \\"Roulette\\", the only acoustic track. Some songs that stick out to me were Chic N' Stu, Roulette, Streamline and Highway Song. I'm not saying the rest of the songs are bad, they are very good and very catchy, i find myself wanting to sing the songs all the time. Anybody who hasnt already heard any System of a Down should get this cd, and anybody who likes any of their songs or has any of their cds, BUY THIS CD. YOU NEED THIS CD. Why are you still reading this, go buy the cd and enjoy it...
630460288X|4.0|Sylvester Stallone is John Spartan, the infamous \\"Demolition Man\\" of the LAPD, a one man SWAT team with more brawn than brains.  In the near future, Spartan botches a hostage situation involving a one-man crime wave named Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes).  Though Phoenix is caught, all the hostages are killed.  Both Phoenix and Spartan are convicted and sentenced to cryogenic suspended animation - Spartan for 40 years, Phoenix forever.  Spartan is re-animated in the less near future decades later for an impromptu parole board review.  By now, the city is cleaner, neater and much more polite (everybody carries personal locators imbedded in them and are monitored at all times; bad langauge is punishable; guns are completely outlawed - it's like Singapore and \\"Rodeo Drive\\").  Ruled by the sage Dr. Cocteau, everybody speaks in full sentences and call each other by their full name - all the time.  In other words - it's a time that neither Phoenix nor Spartan belong in.  Mysteriously, Phoenix manages to end run the security devices holding him in - escaping into a future ill-equipped to deal with him.  When Phoenix singlehandedly wipes out a squad of future-cops sent to reel him in, PO Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) comes up with the desperate idea of re-animating Spartan, thinking him the only one capable of taking Phoenix down.  Spartan finds the new era a shock - meat is outlawed, corporate franchises operate at every economic level (witness our heroes enjoying an elegant dinner party...at Taco Bell!?!?) and pop-culture is devoted to old commercial jingles.  He also finds that plain old poverty survived the brave new world - with a tribe of starving bandits eking out a bare (if un PC existence) in the old LA sewers behind the oddly named Ed Friendly (Denis Leary).  While committed to icing Phoenix (for good this time) Spartan also pursues an odd link between Phoenix and the seemingly sage Dr. Cocteau, the architect of this brave new world.<br />Though it's big and loud, there's more to this action flick than Joel Silver pyrotechnics (this is opposite of \\"Swordfish\\" which was supposedly was about cyber-crime and terrorism, but instead really was about big explosions, rapid fire weapons and skin).  Instead, the flick slyly creates political correctness only to have both Phoenix and Spartan blast it to pieces - when Phoenix compares Cocteau to an evil version of \\"Mr. Rodgers\\", you'll know for certain.  If you had to read \\"Brave New World\\" in school, you'll find some references linking the flick and the book, but mostly it's about weak and polite people getting beaten or thrown through plate glass or simply running or fainting away in cowardice at the slightest sign of danger.  The script is great, having the future citizens speak in a new age style of speech in which they dish out such howlers as \\"dump your hormones\\" and \\"what is your boggle\\".  Stallone is great as a pirahna out of water, completely out of his league in a future that has no 4-letter words.  But Snipes is also great playing the hyper-everything Simon Phoenix in an over-the-top performance that hints at how much fun the \\"Blade\\" movies could have been.  Sandra Bullock threatens to steal the movie playing the little-girl adult character of Lenina Huxley (one of the flick's more overt references to \\"Brave New World\\") whose loyalty to the new age masks a nostalgia for the old ways (with their action, their big, unsafe and inefficient cars, and their idiotic catch phrases \\"Take this job and shovel it!\\" and \\"let's blow this guy\\")  Any way you cut it, a fun flick you should blow (away) some time with.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Although I loved 'Genie In A Bottle,\\" I have never before purchased a Christina Aguilera album.  This album, however, is a major exception.<br />First off, let me say that I did not rate this album a 5 because I do not care for the filler material ... the multiple intros ... of which there are three on this album.  I also do not care for rap, and this album could have certainly done without the likes of Lil Kim.<br />Aside from this, all I can say is 'Wow!\\"  This is really a great album, and it sickens my stomach to hear people try to compare Christina to the likes of Britney Spears.  Britney Spears has zero, nada, zip singing ability, while Christina is just incredible.  She actually has talent beyond a sexy body and gyrating hips.<br />Thankfully, although Lil Kim contributes to the song, \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" she doesn't totally destroy it.  Still, I think this song is just another typical radio song ... no real meaning whatsoever and no staying power.<br />'Walk Away' is just fabulous.  The piano, the rhythm, and the sultry bluesy singing sounds a great deal like Alicia Keyes.  It is one of my favorite songs on the album.<br />'Fighter' reminds me of Janet Jackson's 'Black Cat.'  I cannot wait to see the video for this song.  I think Christina is just going to bust out with this one.<br />'Infatuation' has a very Latiny, get-on-your-feet-and-dance kind of sound.  I really like it.<br />'Loving Me 4 Me' is okay.  It is very slow, almost too much so, and it is one that I can live with or without.<br />'Impossible' is Christina's collaboration with Alicia Keyes.  I think that Alicia must have been a great inspiration to Christina on this album since a lot of the songs remind me of Alicia.  This is a very good song.<br />'Underappreciated' is typical radio waste material.  I do not care for it.<br />What is there to say about 'Beautiful?'  It's simply beautiful.<br />'Make Over' is one of my least favorite songs on the album.  It's too No Doubtish and hard for Christina's voice.  It's really a waste of her talent in my humble opinion.<br />'Cruz' is a pretty song, but it just somehow seems to come up short.  It does not have the depth that I know Christina is capable of.<br />'Soar' also seems to fall short.  It is okay.<br />'Get Mine, Get Yours' has a great beat.  From the get go, it makes you want to dance.  It just has that funky erotic just-get-down-and-do-it beat.<br />Although 'Dirrty' is a popular radio hit, I absolutely do not like it.  I can hang with the video since Christina is just sexy, sexy, sexy and exciting to watch.  The song by itself is just noise.<br />'The Voice Within' is another diatribe about following your dream and listening to the voice within.  While a pretty song, it just seems ... well, empty.<br />'I'm OK' is excellent.  The beginning of the song sounds like Styx' 'Madame Blue.'  The words are beautiful and chilling, and the synchronistic guitar playing really touches you.  This song makes me want to weep.  If you were abused as a child and witnessed your mother being abused also, this song will really touch you.  This is the most poignant song on the CD, and I feel that it really should have been the first release.  I guess catering to the hip-hop, shake your booty crowd sells more CDs; but it's really not representative of the depth and sincerity of this CD.<br />'Keep on Singin My Song' seems kind of empty and flat to me also.  The endless loop-de-loop of \\"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\\" is also tiring.  Good singers just have to know when to quit.<br />People with talent like Christina really should take the time to commit to an album full of great songs that will be lasting.  The filler, intro, hip-hop trash needs to go.  We need to get back to decency and to the heart in our music.  I think it is for this very reason that Celine Dion has been so popular.  She knows how to sing about love and mean it and make you feel it.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Though I admit I'm not really a big fan of country/bluegrass/old-time spiritual music, there's just something about this album that I really enjoy and gets me in a happy mood whenever I listen to it. Now I will admit that some songs are quite boring and get tiresome very quickly, but a few songs not only give this album its well-deserved 5-star rating but also makes it whole-heartedly worth buying. You Are My Sunshine, I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow, I Am Weary (Let Me Rest), In the Jailhouse Now, and especially Angel Band are the best songs on this whole collection and give it its down-home feel-good country feel to it. If you are even a slight fan of this kind of old-time music you should definitely give it a shot or even if you're just like me and you want to know what all the fuss is about and why in the world it won the best album Grammy (which by the way was well-deserved considering the lackluster competition it was up against), then I dare you to pick this one up and listen to it thoroughly all the way through. Sure the above mentioned songs make it worthy in every sense of the word, but the other songs aren't really slouches either and strengthen the album as a whole. This is one collection of music that everyone should definitely own. All I have left to say is to just buy this album and prepare to be blown away.
B000002B7O|5.0|This one is my favorite Ozzy album.<BR>It's got alot of classic songs and this album<BR>is one of his most popular albums.Over the mountain,<BR>Flying high again,Believer,You can't kill rock n roll,<BR>Tonight,S.A.T.O.,Diary of a madman,Little dolls.<BR>I listen to this one all the time,I just can't get<BR>enough of Ozzy.My favorite song on here is Diary of<BR>a madman,if you don't own this album you are missing<BR>out on a classic rock n roll masterpiece.Ozzy rules!!
B00007E8V4|5.0|System of a Down has done it again. Although this album isn't new material, just a collection of old unreleased songs, it's as good as the others. <br />I got this CD yesterday. Since than I've been listening to the songs and their lyrics. I kind of enjoy the album better when my CD player is on shuffle. The order the cd is in makes it sort of repetitive. I suggest you play it in it's natural order and if  you don't enjoy it that much just shuffle the songs. Or if you're one of those people who only listen to 3 songs out of an entire album because they are hits don't buy the CD at all. Go buy yourself respect for an artist by listening to an entire album.<BR> <BR>The songs are pretty short on this album. Each song is around 2 minutes and something seconds. There are a few songs around 3 minutes and one song totaling in 4 min. and 9 sec. Don't get me wrong, the songs are not in any way affected by their amount of time.<br />In the end, I reccomend you buy this CD. That is if you are into System of a Down. You won't be dissapointed.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Can I give it 10 stars???<br />these remastered recordings are remarkable andthe new music proves that at 60 Barbra sounds as good as ever! The new manilow duet is a pop hit made for radio!<br />I would pay the price just to have the duet she does with her self on One less Bell to Answer/House is Not a Home.<br />If you are a good friend buy 10 like I did for all you friends for Xmas A true multigenerational Superstar at nher best!

B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave is quite possibly one of the best CDs, if not the best CD, of the year. It combines Rage Against the Machine's awesome guitar, bass, and drum beats with Chris Cornell's unique voice to become a great CD. Despite the fact of being able to listen to the CD without skipping a song, Audioslave brings back good memories of RAM and Soundgarden. So be sure that if you don't have it yet, to make sure it's a stocking stuffer for you or any other person you know with good music taste.
B00006J9OV|5.0|This is a traditionally staged version from the Met. Somebody complained about the slow tempi by Levine, but, I think this tempi also works fine. All the Wagner's opera could be conducted in different ways and, if you like this tempi or the other, it's all up to your musical taste (e.g. Bernstein's slow Tristan is as much appreciated as the fast Boehm's). It's not like Solti's magnificent CD set, not even better than Armin Jordan's conducting in Syberberg's film version, though, I have nothing to complain about it.<BR>The cast in this production is impressive. Weikl, Moll, Rootering, all the legends are here. There would be no one who could portray Kundry better than Meier, both physically and musically at the same time. She is terrific, expressive, powerful, above all, beautiful. Jerusalem is okay. Vocally excellent, but, not a good actor... well, at least he is good looking.<BR>The video transfer could have been better, while the sound is excellent and includes DTS. Thank God it didn't fall in the hands of dreadful Pioneer Classics! Image Entertainment could have done a better job?? There are optional subtitles in five languages including the original German. This set includes some special features &amp; booklet with pictures. Nice presentation.<BR>Now there are two DVD version of Parsifal. Me, being the biggest fan of Parsifal, I got them both. Which one is better? It's a hard question. Musically Syberberg's film version has no comparison, otherwise both are so great and so different. Get them both!
B000075BFK|5.0|Tupac's best album. it's that simple. Buy it! Ignore Dalton Higgins' stupid review.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt is a band whose music I had never purchased before.  Over the last several months, however, the band has STEADILY released one hot single after another off of their most recent album, Rock Steady.  With each new single, my curiosity and interest in Rock Steady grew, until one day when a friend played the album for me.  After hearing the album in its entirety, I instantly bought it.  <br />Let there be NO DOUBT about it: there's a reason this band is as hot as they are in today's music scene.  This is an enormously talented set of musicians.  Rock Steady is nothing but fun, through and through, from the first all the way to the last song.  The tunes on this album are irresistible.  Gwen and her boys are passionate, talented, and charismatic performers.  The production on the album is superb.  Rock Steady is unquestionably a product born of veteran musicians who began with raw talent and abundant energy and have learned a few lessons from the fruits of success. <br />You've heard the hit singles.  If you like those, then you'll definitely enjoy the rest of this album.  From start to finish, No Doubt's Rock Steady will be candy to your ears.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spider Man is a great movie because it tells that he can jump from a tower to another and showes you how strong his web is.And it also showes you that he do not stop when the green goblin attacks him.

B00006GFAB|4.0|I agree with another review, \\"ALMOST the Very Best.\\"   \\"I Want You\\" and \\"I Stole Your Love,\\" although great tracks, could have been left off in favor of a couple of 80's tracks.  Where's \\"Heaven's on Fire,\\" which epitomized the band's 80's sound? Or, \\"Tears are Falling?\\" While not their best song, it was a well known 80's track ( I didn't want to say 'hit').  How about \\"Domino?\\"  These tracks would have balanced the collection while still maintaining a core set of tracks from the makeup era. After \\"Greatest Kiss\\" do we really need another collection primarily of seventies material?  Point being, there's more to Kiss than the makeup era.  True, the late 80's Kiss era (\\"Crazy Nights,\\" \\"Let's put the X...\\", etc.) was the low point, although \\"Forever\\" is classic.  Nevertheless, Kiss' music has always been HIGHLY underrated, so this collection cannot get anything less than 4 stars.

B00006RU5B|5.0|They've done it again, (for the first time). Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine have achieved to make the best rock album of 2002. This album rocks! Cornell and Morello are off the hook! Morello's sounds are something that I have never heard before, not even on any Rage album. Cornell's lyrics are the best of the year. He also shows off his range in songs like &quot;Cochise,&quot; &quot;What You Are,&quot; and &quot;Bring Them Back Alive.&quot; I bought it the same day it came out and it hasn't left my cd player. I urge any real rock fan to buy this album because it achieves everything that the bands of today are not really able to. It is a breath of fresh air. BUY IT TODAY IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T.

B00006LIRI|3.0|I have to echo the sentiments of others and say this is a good &quot;Best of&quot; CD, but could of been soooo much better. <br />Omitting &quot;Walk On&quot;, &quot;Elevation&quot;, &quot;Lemon&quot;, and &quot;The Fly&quot; is criminal. You can also make a case for &quot;Wild Horses&quot; and &quot;Please&quot;. Some of these songs charted and should be included at the very least as &quot;B-Side Remixes&quot; or something, i.e. &quot;Elevation -- Tomb Raider Mix.&quot;<br />I agree with another reviewer that the &quot;B-Side&quot; remixes to this CD leave you feeling extremely flat. Not much excitement even for a true fan. &quot;Miss Sarejevo&quot; and &quot;Hands Across America&quot; would have made the second disc better and given us a couple of better songs on the first disc.<br />The DVD that comes with the Deluxe Edition is a joke and left me wondering...&quot;why?&quot; One of those rare moments where I think the U2 marketing machine took advantage of my obsession with this group.<br />Still, it is in my collection and will be played quite often. New CD comes out in 2003. Here's to the start of another decade from the best rock band on the planet....
B000002LQR|5.0|It's hard to resist the Red Hot Chili Pepper's charm.  Over the course of seventy minutes or so, the listener is taken on a journey through everything the Pepper's have ever accomplished with perhaps a glimpse of what is to come.  Blood Sugar has everything.  From hardcore rap rock to melodramatic love ode's to mindless filler to monster guitar riffs to radio friendly superhits to sexual fantasies to eclectic grooves, it's incredible how much experimental variety is contained in the album.  The Pepper's have always experimented with new sounds, but never to such a broad scope.  Nowadays, they are more mellow whereas back in the 80's they were more chaotic.  Blood Sugar has elements of both, and while not all of it sounds quite comprehensible, there's enough great tracks to more than make up for shortcomings.  Overall, the definitive Red Hot Chili Peppers album is Blood Sugar Sex Magic.
B00007E8V4|5.0|AWESOME. As if Self Titled and Toxicity wernt enough, Steal this Album comes out with the same unique system of a down sound but enhanced.... ALOT. As with most of the tracks on their previous albums most of their songs are Political, but that dosn't matter. The more Political the better. <BR>If you like System of a Down Go and buy this NOW if you dont GO BUY IT ANYWAY its the best.
B00007E8V4|5.0|If you liked the older CDs you have to buy this one. In some of the songs are alittle different than what we have heard before.<BR>In some songs there have less of a heavy metal approach and almost like a soft rock. But they still have those songs that you can rock hard to. I really suggest you buy this CD
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is an awesome CD. With the intergalactic guitar magic of Tom Morello laid out over the red hot barn-burning funk of Timmy C and Brad...accented by the one of a kind Cornell vocals, this album is sure to be a heavy hitter in the music industry this year. Some of my favorite tracks are Shadow of The Sun, Gasoline and Set It Off (written as a dual tribute to Martin Luther King and the WTO protests).<BR>Although, there is a bit lost without Zack de la Rocha, this is still a killer album and a must for any diehard Rage Against The Machine fan, such as myself.<...
0151008116|2.0|The power of the Booker Prize to promote mediocre works is impressive. This novel is sometimes amusing, but often careless and self-indulgent with loose writing. It's a fantasy with one character and that character not deeply known. It's pretensions of religious insight are more flashy than wise, and too often the author seems to be straining to keep the story going with pointless invention. This is far from the best among current novels.
B00005JLZL|1.0|In the tradition of such rip-offs of Dead Man Walking, like the Sharon Stone downer Last Dance or the Clint Eastwood race against the clock True Crime, Hollywood yet again rehashes the man on death row plot formula.  This time washed up, just-looking-for-a-paycheck director Alan Parker-who once made decent films like Midnight Express and Angel Heart, and one great creative experience known as Pink Floyd The Wall-takes two time Oscar winner turned Hollywood sell-out-or is he just being used and thrown out by the big city-Kevin Spacey and makes about the most bland uninteresting cliché filled ruckus of a film against the death penalty, The Life of David Gale. <br />David Gale (Spacey) is the head of Death Watch, an advocacy group against capital punishment.  He's also a college professor who we learn has some dark tendencies, like sleeping with one of his students in a drunken stupor.  After being accused of raping this damsel in distress, David basically loses his life-his wife leaves him, he loses his job at the college and as head of Death Watch, and he becomes even more of an alcoholic than he was before. <br />The problem with The Life of David Gale is that his life is not all that interesting.  The film is obviously trying to make him human with his sexual desires and failures.  But really it just makes him seem pathetic.  There's this laughable scene where Spacey is stumbling through the streets, trying to act drunk, and I just couldn't keep a straight face.  What happened to the Kevin Spacey that gave such a darkly humorous performance in American Beauty, to the Spacey of the cripple Verbal Kent or the detective of the stars in L. A. Confidential? <br />What we needed here was to see David in his heyday, fighting against capital punishment, displaying his passion and his reasoning, and his fall from this.  The filmmakers try to achieve all this in one scene where he faces off with the Governor of Texas on TV, clearly a jab at President Bush (and rightly so),where he wins the battle with his wits, but loses the war because of his elitist need of being all high and mighty instead of trying to win the debate. <br />Bitsey Bloom, Kate Winslet's overly melodramatic reporter, is just as shallow a character as David.  Are we supposed to sympathize with her just because she cries numerous times?  If this role isn't a staged ploy for an Oscar for Winslet, I don't know what is.  To top it off, Laura Linney's disease ridden victim when David goes forth with his pity lay just brings to mind a certain image with a certain quote, \\"Chloe looked how Meryl Streep's skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around the party being extra nice to everyone.\\" (Ed Norton as narrator in Fight Club).  If you watch the film in question that indemnifies 90's pop culture, you'll know what I mean. <br />The biggest problem with The Life of David Gale is its obvious attempt to focus solely on the theme of being against capital punishment.  The reason Dead Man Walking worked so well is because we got to know the two main characters so well, there was humanity in Penn's murderer, and this is what screamed that the state's function is not to kill people.  Here, these are just caricatures and we don't really care for them. <br />Aside from Dead Man Walking, another good example of a film against the death penalty that doesn't force its cause on you is Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark.  It's about many things, from fantasy to sacrifice, and has a message, but in the end it doesn't force it on you, it makes you think, it raises questions. <br />With The Life of David Gale, Kevin Spacey follows a dud with a dud-following up last year's K-Pax that was Hollywood alien cliché nonsense.  After taking home the Best Actor Academy Award for American Beauty, Spacey's either sold out to Hollywood, or he's being used.  All I can say is:  Mr. Spacey, let's start being a little more selective.  You can still get the big paycheck and make a good movie! <BR>  <br/>After the film was over at a recent advanced screening, I said to a couple of people next to me, \\"That was awful.\\"  They said they liked it and especially the twist at the end, which from my perspective doesn't really add anything to the film.  Well, there you go, the verdict is in from the average movie going audience.  I almost feel bad because I can't say anything good about this film, except that I agree with it politically-I don't want it to seem like I'm smearing this film for the sake of smearing a Hollywood big budget film...but folks, this is K-Pax Redux.  If you like the same Hollywood garbage force-fed down your throat over and over again, by all means, rush out to see this film. <BR>  <BR>Alternative Recommendations:  Dead Man Walking, Dancer in the Dark, The Usual Suspects, American Beauty, Fight Club, Pink Floyd The Wall, Angel Heart, Heavenly Creatures

B00005JLEU|5.0|To begin with I can't help but agree with all the accolades for this movie.  English version or not, this plays as well as any picture I've ever experienced.  Over 40 years ago as a boy, I was enchanted by a special animated film (of who's name I can't remember, and I've never found again). The film was about a young boy learning to be a man. He was taught by a wise man, wizard, sensei or something like that, in ways that changed his view of the world and his perception of himself.  The challenges he faced were very \\"Eastern\\", (yet still universal) and the philosophy learned has carried through my life to this day. Spirited Away is the type of movie that can have this kind of effect on young viewers.  The positive experience we can draw from movies like this, can't be compared to banal animation films with dancing tea cups, and weak lessons in PC morality.  <BR>    Unfortunately Disney wants to control the animation market for young children.  Its pathetic efforts in the releasing of Spirited Away, and the previous Ghibli Studio movie Princess Mononoke, provide compelling evidence that Disney fears the intrusion of quality competition into its US marketplace.  I had to drive over 100 miles to see Spirited Away because Disneys maximum release was 151 theaters, and that was only for a week.  I would encourage any anime fan or any discerning parent to buy the DVD or video when it is released.  If you should get the chance to see the movie on the big screen, don't miss it, its a real treat for the eyes and the mind.
0062502174|4.0|Wow, what an amazing read...I too have read this while I was going through a very rough patch in my life, moving around, quitting jobs and finding new ones, dealing with the fact that my fiancee is not coming home for another 6 months from treeplanting, not really sure what my point is in life, etc,etc.<br /> Needless to say, this book is overloading with wisdom and lots of excellent perceptions into following our dreams and realizing ones wishes will one day come true :)<br />It definitely has helped me through and realizing that no matter what happens in life, you've got to follow your heart.<br /> I laughed, I cried and now I'm passing it onto my little sister as she is going to be living hundreds of thousands of miles away from any family member. Hopefully she'll cherish it as much as I have.
0151008116|5.0|This is a story that will make you believe in God. And so Martel begins his book. Reading such a statement, I certainly had to see if the story is indeed worth such a life altering claim.<br />Martel has cleverly and convincingly brought together a Zebra, a Hyena, an Orangutan, a Tiger, and a boy, on a life boat. Nature's takes over and man and beast are brought to the same common denominator. Who will adapt? Who will survive? How?  <br />It must be said that this book has a deeper meaning I am still resolving. However, since the story kept getting more fantastic and weird, it was all I could do to just keep up with the plot. Martel makes some poignant remarks regarding the search for God and other reviewers have hinted the struggle on the life boat is merely an allegory. <br />Ultimately, I just enjoyed it because it was a fun and interesting story that was just so bizarre. I still can't believe Martel was able to pull this off. <br />I hear he is currently working on a novel about an elephant in a submarine.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This Remastered compilation offers some of Nirvana's best songs with a sound like never heard before.  True audiophile Nirvana fans will appreciate the tighter bass, higher dynamic range, and openness of Kurt's vocals that this cd offers.  Comparings songs such as &quot;come as you are&quot; with this cd as compared to the studio release Nevermind, you will notice a substantial improvment in every aspect of the audio range. Notice how the background symbol is more evident, the kick drum is more snappy and kurts voice even more raspy.  This is a must have Nirvana cd if you have a half decent stereo and want to enjoy one the the best bands ever the way they are supposed to sound.
B000002VC5|3.0|Buy it if you're a prog-rock fan, but it is wat to boring with quite a few bad songs. There are, although, a couple good ones: tracks 3, 4, and 5.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Every track on this remastered &quot;best of&quot; cd gives audiophiles a chance to hear Nirvana like never before.  Comparing tracks such as &quot;come as you are&quot; on this cd compared to the studio release Nevermind, you will notice tighter bass, higher dynamics, and an openness in Kurt's vocals like never heard before.

B00007E8V4|5.0|System of a Down has always been different and ahead of the pack with their music.  They take one step farther away with Steal This Album.  The album, consisting of unreleased songs, is practically a continuous album, giving you no time to catch your breath, which was a problem for me.  More then a few times I couldn't tell where one song ended and another one started.  I would glance at the CD player and it would be on the next track.  Here is a track by track listing, with a rating out of 10<br />Chic'N'Stu-Probably not the best song to start the album, its hilarious, with seemingly no point at all, but its got some good parts to it.  I would have started with something more serious.  <BR>Rating: 7/10<br />Innervision- The new single, this song is amazing.  Combing great rythms and the Serj Tankian's usual amazing vocals, this song packs it all in and gives you a kick<BR>Rating: 9/10<br />Bubbles- Another song that has the short, kick you in the a** feeling.  This one is good, with the same beat as track 1 shown by drummer John Dolmayan near the end.<BR>Rating: 8/10<BR>Boom- Very political, parts of it are great, parts are boring<BR>Rating:7/10<br />Nuguns- One of the best songs on the CD, with amazing harmonizing by Daron Malakian.  Great song, worthy of being a single, but probably on the heavy side.<BR>Rating:9/10<br />A.D.D.- Another political one, great song, with Dolmayan putting opposite and very staggering drum beat.  Great stuff.<BR>Rating: 9/10<br />Mr. Jack- Currently my second favorite song on the album.  Amazing passionate singing by Tankian near the end. THe song takes a big dive at the end as they turn it into a joke.<BR>Rating: 9/10<BR>I-E-A..- This one is probably the strangest.  It combines very heavy strange rambling, and also a Jewish rabbi-type chant in the middle which is incredible.  They are the only band that could do something like this.<BR>Rating: 8.5/10<BR>36- Well, its 36 seconds long, just to say that<BR>Rating: 5/10<BR>Pictures- Another one thats short and sweet, I started to get bored here, it all sounded the same.<BR>Rating: 6/10<BR>Highway Song: One I didn't get into as much yet, it'll take me a while, but its a very good song<BR>Rating:8/10<BR>F**k The System: Why?<BR>Rating:3/10<BR>Ego Brain: SLower song, with a more \\"rock-y\\" feel to it.  Great vocals as always.<BR>Rating: 9/10<BR>Thetawaves: The whole purpose of this song is too set up Roulette.<BR>Rating: 6/10<BR>Roulette:  Simply amazing.  Amazing Harmonizing, amazing vocals, amazing guitar.  Done deal, best song on the album.<BR>Rating: 10/10<BR>Streamline: Great song, AMAZING vocals by Tankian, and a great solo by Malakian.  Nice bass playing at the beginning by Shavo.  This song ends a great album, that seemed to progress towards the end.  I hope they quiet down a little bit, but never lose their energy.  Great album, take a listen.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When Christina Aguilera first dropped into the spotlight of teenage stardom, it was carefully molded. With the exception of her amazing voice, she was a carbon copy of all those other Mickey Mouse Club girls. But with this album, she brings it back to home, stripping everything (yes, including clothes) to make a wholesome and true album. Christina proudly holds writing credits on just about every track on this, her sophomore album, and even produces one. She shows her true colors with songs like \\"Keep on Singing My Song\\" and with a heartfelt confession to her father in \\"I'm Okay\\". Even though this album comes with a flurry of gossip on her seemingly barren body, there's one thing that holds very true: Christina Aguilera is no longer a little girl, and Stripped shows you the triumphs and pains of a young woman living in the harsh industry that we call music.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is exactly what one would expect from a combination of the instumentals of Rage Against the Machine and the voice of Soundgarden, Chris Cornell.  This album rocks, even though it is not politically minded like Rage.  The lack of rap is different and refreshing.  Buy this album for sure; it is a good purchase.
B000075BFK|5.0|Yo its great to here Pac again, ive been waitin for this album since the last one said he had another coming out. I loved Pac since be4 he died, well to me it seems as tho he didnt die with all these cds comeing out.

0393039765|5.0|&quot;fight club&quot; is an amazing mixture of dark, sarcastic humor and the human spirit. <br />i saw the movie &amp; immeditelly ran over to the library to check the book out. while they end differently, both are amazing works, however the book, as in most cases, is better. <br />its disturbing and chaotic and beautiful and i suggest to everyone to buy a copy of it yourself. (its on MY wish list!)<br />&quot;i felt like destroying something beautiful&quot;<br />ps. for those of you, like me, who go crazy when the narrorator in a book is never given a name, i'll do you favor. the narrorators name is JACK
B000002KB8|4.0|I'm listening to the LP as I write this...what a difference 32 years makes! I bought the album as a college freshman in 1970. In those days, people at school were in \\"competition\\" to build the loudest, bass-butt kickingest audio system possible. The litmus test for said sensory marvels was the Black Sabbath album: the music was loud and primitive. Add this album (disc) to your collection. Its a very good listen.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|I can listen to any Accept CD and enjoy it. However, this album is heads above the rest of their work. \\"Balls To the Wall\\" gives it all to you; ripping-fast motivational rants like \\"Winners and Losers,\\" melancholy \\"Cold Winter Nights,\\" and Udo growling the song \\"London Leatherboys;\\" nobody can turn a raspy gutteral voice into great music the way Udo Dirkschneider can! And not a lot of mid 80s metal bands had the guts to pen a song like \\"Lovechild,\\" about a guy coming to terms with his gay lifestyle. <br />There is a two CD set out there that includes this album along with \\"Restless and Wild.\\" \\"Restless and Wild\\" is a really good album, and if you want a basic \\"best of\\" Accept collection, it's a good buy. If you are starting to get quite an ear for Accept and plan to get a thorough collection of their music, the extra concert tracks on this particular album are quality enough to shell out the extra dollars for this CD separate from \\"Restless & Wild.\\"<br />If you haven't listened to this band before, this CD is the perfect introduction!
B000075BFK|5.0|When I went to the local ... store to pick up this 2pac double-disked CD, I really didn't know what to expect. Could the rap legend live up to the All Eyez on Me standards or would this be just a waste of money by some greedy producers. So I popped it in and was very surprised. <br />First off, the rhymes are off the hook. The lyrics to most songs are incredible and he flows like the best ever. Second, the beats are catchy for the pop fans yet hard enough for the gangsta fans out there. <br />I throughly enjoyed the material on both CDs. It seemed like 2pac was more R and Bish on this CD then any other one but hey, he sounded good, different, and unique. Nice breath of fresh air. <br />There are a number of keeper songs on these two, but maybe a few I didn't care for, but not many. I liked Better Dayz, Never Call You ***** Again, Fair Xchange, Fame Thugz Mansion, and those are just off the top of my head.<br />Overall, this is a tight CD. It's not as good as All Eyez on Me but that's the best CD of all time in my mind, so that would be difficult to top. This is however a nice listen and a must buy for all rap fans of all ages.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Alright, this certainly does work as a fine sampling for a casual fan. All the big hits(save for one classic 1974 recording that went all the way to #1)are present, and in chronological order. The way I see it though, in order for this to be truly comprehensive, there simply needed to be a third disc of material(not a bonus disc with four songs).<BR> Alright, I might as well come right out with it.. where the heck is \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\"?? So, Elton and Bernie didn't write that one, so what?? It was #1, and with all the history of Elton and Mr. John Lennon, sharing the stage at Madison Square Garden on Thanksgiving, 1974, you'd think it would be here.. I'm sorry, but even with just two discs to work with, that one should have somehow found it's way on here. Now, I will also say, even with just a two disc set, \\"The Last Song\\" would have been a nice touch, just to round out the later years a little better. \\"Written In The Stars\\" is a fine ballad, and \\"This Train Don't Stop There Anymore\\" is great, but were either of these songs really hits, especially the latter?<BR> <BR>Anyway, as I said before, a third disc really should have been included, considering the fact that Elton already had three hit collections, plus 15 years worth of highlights(1987-2002), that had not been rounded up, until this point. I can understand though, why he ended up going this route; this puts him out there with other greats, who have recently released two disc sets, that span entire careers(Billy Joel, Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, Bee Gee's), and a third disc would have made it that much more expensive. So, this does give someone the general picture, and manages to be a great listen.<BR> Still though, one can't help but long for some of the hits that were left in the dark.. As I mentioned before, \\"The Last Song\\", \\"Mama Can't Buy You Love\\"(a top ten hit, btw), \\"Blue Eyes\\"(#12), \\"Kiss The Bride\\", maybe even \\"Simple Life\\", or \\"Club At The End Of Street\\", and keep in mind, these are justthe singles; what about \\"Pinball Wizard\\" or \\"Song For Guy\\"?<BR>In any case, his devoted fans already own what albums they find necessary, and will probably pick this up just to add to an already complete collection, and this should hopefully introduce him to a whole new generation; so, I guess it really manages to be a can't lose situation.
B00006CXXU|5.0|First Of All XxxTina has grown up you can tell to her more mature lyrics on the songs she has definetely grown up you all may think she's a slut why just because she dresses like one she's not! she has a nice voice she should sing with Mariah Carey!! so yeah this Cd is good to listen to when you are depressed!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney, her third album, almost a completly different style to her previous and debut albums and shows in songs such as 'Lonely','Let Me Be','Bombastic Love'<br /> She is trying to get a message across that is she is not quite a girl anymore but more of a woman and she wants people to treat her as an adult and this shows in songs such as 'Not a girl' and 'Overprotected' and her raunchy and quite shoking 'Slave 4 U'. A lot of these songs have more of a mature approach than on other albums.<br />She sings the classic song, 'I love rock and roll'. And it seems she always feels a need to cover a song on each of her albums. She says this song is a reflection of herself and what she was going through at the time. And personaly, listeneing to this album really makes me wonder what she's really like.<br />My favourites on the album have to be 'Overprotected', 'Slave 4 U',& 'Boys'. Overprotected is a song I know I'll always like, it's quite well done with the 'ACTION!' bits, Boys is quite funky and different and a nice dance type of song and very catchy,and Slve 4 U the same, but is quite disturbing with her dancing to it.<br />Overall a great album, and, again, a different sounding album to her previous ones, so if you liked her other two albums you may might want to think about buying this since it's such a different style. She's also been critisized for having a 'potty mouth' on this album, but it's nothing compared to Christina's new album ' Stripped'. The only 'bad' words used here is 'damn' and 'hell', so don't let that be a reason not to buy this album.<br />I give it 4/5 stars, she looses one star for trying a little too hard to prove her point of growing up.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Wow. That is one word of many that i could use to describe Audioslave. The album met my expectations(which were extremely high) and went even further than i thought possible. The album starts out with rockers like Cochise and Gasoline, then enters into a new melodic sound not heard by Tom Tim or Brad before. But the album never lets up. Songs like exploder and Light my Way keep you thouroghly rocked. Then the album ends on The Last Remaining Light which is one of the best songs on the album. But the most remarkable part about the entire album is how well the chemestry is. Songs like getaway car and i am the highway show off the fact that this record is not a mixture of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden, but it is Audioslave.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is AWESOME!! Chris Cornell has one of the best voices in music...put that together with the blasting sound of Rage Against The Machine and it's unbelievable! BUY THIS ALBUM!!
0375823360|3.0|As a teacher and a lover of good books, I have conflicting opinions of \\"His Dark Materials.\\"  For pure \\"good read\\" value, I would consider this series on par with the Harry Potter series: not great literature, but well-crafted and compelling.  Unlike the Potter series, which borrows heavily from many different existing characters and works, \\"His Dark Materials\\" is pure and original in its imaginative scope.  Characters are very realistic, each possessing the same mixture of good and bad qualites we all possess. The plot twists and turns in a manner that is completely unpredictable. For these and many other reasons, the series is remarkably realistic for a fantasy piece, but this is where my problem with the series begins.<br />Like Judy Blume before him, Mr. Pullman and his publishers have decided to market very controversial material to minors without providing warning to parents as to just what the books contain.  While Blume's books contain realistic and often graphic depictions of teen and pre-teen sexuality and other controversial topics of interest to young people, Mr. Pullman has decided to use this blending of realistic and fantasy elements to take on religion.<br />I am not a religious person myself, but even I was shocked by the lack of respect and even contempt for anything resembling organized religion that Mr. Pullman displays in this trilogy (except Shamanism, with which he doesn't seem to have a problem). Ironically, the knife Mr. Pullman uses to skewer religion is anything but subtle. I could cite multiple instances of his treatment, but to do so would ruin a good story for those interested in reading it.  Let it suffice to say that anti-religious sentiments pervade the series to the point that religion itself is the \\"dark force in the universe.\\"  I found this premise fascinating, but then I am a thirty-something year old man who can enjoy a story without automatically accepting its underlying premise. I worry that many of the young people who read and enjoy \\"His Dark Materials\\" will find this literary Trojan horse so compelling that they actually rush to embrace the Trojans as they appear from within.  Parents struggling to provide religious and moral training for their children are done a disservice when authors like Mr. Pullman write a book the purpose of which is to undermine those very efforts.  For the record, I am not assuming Mr. Pullman's intent with regards to the intentions of his trilogy.  I actually saw an interview with him on television in which he spelled out the anti-religious underpinnings of \\"His Dark Materials.\\"  <br />To sum it all up, I'm not for censoring anything. The story is a good one. I really enjoyed it. I just don't think it should be marketed to young people.  It should, instead, be marketed to adults who bring some additional wisdom and perspective to the work.<br />I understand that a movie version of \\"His Dark Materials\\" is already in the works.  If you think the protests of the super-conservative religious types were loud when the Potter craze began, wait until the vast numbers of religious moderates join the fray when they find out what their children have been learning about God and religion in Mr. Pullman's wildly popular books.  Let's hope the film industry is responsible enough not to market this film adaptation directly to children.  Okay, I know I'm not being realistic.  It won't be long before we see the assassin priest, decrepit God, and gay angel couple action figures in our local stores along with the picket signs of many good people whom Mr. Pullman purposely intended to insult and offend. They, of course, will look like narrow-minded, intolerant idiots and Mr. Pullman will become the media's latest downtrodden first amendment crusader.  He will also be a multi-millionaire.<br />Well played, Mr. Pullman.
0060523794|2.0|The title of this book says it all: elephants don't naturally dance, it takes years of cruel training to make them do it, and in the end, there aren't many customers for the show.<br />IBM's revenue record in Appendix C of this book also says it all: Gerstner has the worse revenue growth record of any IBM CEO, and that is despite the the Internet boom, despite the ERP boom, and despite the acquisition of such big players as Sequent, Lotus and Tivoli.  Some turnaround, mate!<br />More than once in this book Gerstner cites the pleas of others: \\"You owe it to America to take this job.\\"  It's hard to see what he has done for America during his nine-year tenure...  Where once there were many readers who wanted to learn about SNA, CICS, RPG/400 and other IBM inventions, today there seem to be no IBM technologies that a sufficient number of people are interested in to propel a manual even in to the bottom of the amazon bestseller list.<br />For the story of Gerstner's tenure at IBM is really the story of IBM's hollowing out, of an extraordinary sell-off of IBM's assets to the short-term benefit of shareholders, of whom Gerstner was one of the biggest.  As one of the IBM UK CEOs during Gerstner's reign, Barrie Morgans, said of Gerstner's skill at cutting costs and inability to boost sales: \\"Well, anybody can slash and burn.\\"  Gerstner says on page 87 that the dismissal of the EMEA head, Hans-Olaf Henkel, was for subverting his memos to employees.  It wasn't: Gerstner got rid of Henkel because Henkel dared to tell Gerstner that one of his strategies wouldn't work..  There is no reference here to the classic case, Churchhouse v IBM, which was heard in a US court.<br />Gerstner also dismisses, in a page or two, the needs of employees in terms of benefits and pensioners.  He simply says they were unaffordable; and yet he has no difficulty in negotiating an extraordinary compensation package for himself.  And of course, as one of IBM's biggest shareholders, the more he could screw down the employees' packages, the more he himself benefitted.  Never in IBM history had their been such a huge disparity between the compensation of the CEO and that of the lowest worker.<br />The truth is that Gerstner sees himself as an elite -- ever the McKinsey consultant (and by the way, there were McKinsey consultants crawling over IBM throughout the 1990s, yet he fails to give them much credit in the book)...

0060523794|1.0|Very early in his reign at IBM, Gerstner gave an interview to Fortune magazine, which subsequently wrote an unflattering profile of the man and the company.  Unable to believe that the publication had revealed any of the truth about him, Gerstner was livid.  Shortly afterwards, IBM stopped all advertising in Fortune.  It was an expensive loss for the magazine, particularly as IBM was relaunching itself with the costly 'Solutions for a Small Planet' campaign.  We'll never know whether the two events were linked, but the magazine industry certainly took on board the message that if you publish an uncomplimentary article on IBM, you'll lose a major advertising customer.<br />In this book, Gerstner portrays himself as a private figure, reluctant now to make speeches, answer analyst questions, or do interviews.  He hopes that his written account will be the definitive version of his life at IBM.  It's hard to find any other: as soon as he arrived at IBM, he forbade all other executives from writing about their IBM careers.  (Shortly before that, IBMers such as Jacques Maisonrouge and 'Buck' Rodgers had published their stories.)<br />Gerstner admits in the book that he's into amassing personal wealth -- and with wealth comes status, something he craves even more.  I don't think he cares much about society or about employees.  The fact that he spent a number of years at the head of a cigarette firm (obsessed with market share, by the way) indicates that he had few qualms about the impact of his firm's products on the customer or society.  Set against that, the foundations of his recently acquired 'passion' for education seem insecure.  But then the english Queen gave him a knighthood for that.<br />This book is a reasonably frank account by a man largely insensitive to the blight he cast on thousands of lives.  My guess is that whether you buy this book or not will make no odds to him -- his personal fortune is too massive to notice -- but if you're influential, he'll carevery much what you think and say about him.

0375414053|3.0|Kate Reddy seems to be Mrs. X from The Nanny Diaries.  The longer I read the book, the more I felt that she made these choices herself, and hundreds of thousand of moms across the world struggle to do what she does, but without the help of a maid or a nanny.  I did enjoy the details and the metaphors throughout the book, and it held my attention all the way through, but I have very little sympathy for Mrs. X, uh, I mean Kate.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Rising from the ashes of Rage Against the Machine, Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk join with former Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell to form a Super group for the new millennium.  This album is just what us rock fans need.  Audioslave's self titled debut alum is long on big-bottomed riff rockers like \\"Set It Off\\" and the debut single, \\"Cochise,\\" not to mention tuneful, panoramic, radio-ready ballads like \\"I Am the Highway\\" and \\"Like a Stone\\"-songs that seem certain to send cigarette lighters aloft in stadiums across the globe.  The Audioslave album is filled with those blasts of unidentified flying feedback that Rage fans have come to love.  But there's something else as well-something we've never really heard from a guitarist like Morello before.  Blues licks.  Jazzy runs.  Bursts of Pagey bluster (Jimmy Page like Riffs [led zepplin]).  But, dont fear because Morello still has plenty of Rage left in him.  Cornell sounds like a god on this album.  Theres nothing left to say, but GO BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006IU73|5.0|It's been a while since I have heard an album that I just can't get enuff of. New prog at it's absolute best. The album at times rocks loud ala Dream Theater, without overdoing it,but also has the most amazing vocals and harmonies that stick in your brain. Short songs that are very accessible to the point of being- pop? Naw I didn't say that. Anyways this cd belongs to anyone who appreciates prog or britpop or just plain good music.A must buy for 2002.
B00006YXEK|5.0|Yes, the album is great. Only regret that there's not more of it, but maybe there will be more of George's late career work released in time. (And maybe \\"All For Love\\" too, someday.) But the deluxe edition packaging needs some praising. <br />This is a primo box package. Beautiful Dark Horse logo in glossy black on flat black with title and signature in George's own writing. Have any critics commented on his \\"By George Harrison\\" byline? The inside of the box is \\"wallpapered\\" with Oms. <br />The poster isn't really a poster so much as a fine photo of George (Hawaii? 2000?)as opposed to CD booklet sized image. The Dark Horse sticker is a little something extra, nothing more. So many \\"critics\\" are complaining about the DVD. Why? Yes, it is short but it is incredibly well crafted, with great interviews. I wish the whole lip syched \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" were included, since it obviously exists. <br />BUT the best part of the whole deluxe box is the \\"autographed\\" guitar pick. Even if you are not a guitarist, you have to appreciate the collector's value of this little, last Fab memento. As if saying, \\"Here's a pick for you to keep while I'm gone to remember me by.\\" And for nonbelievers, it will be worth far more than your old Beatles cards and lunchbox in time because it is a limited edition. <br />But what's with the album cover anyway? Is it really just saying that we are all mannequin/dummies with our televisons turned on? I prefer the box set cover.
0783114893|5.0|One of the greatest and most misunderstood horror movies ever, The Hitcher represents a high point in the careers of the majority of the cast and crew--Robert Harmon never directed this well again, Eric Red never wrote a better screenplay, the score by Mark Isham is superb. Most people seem to think that the killer, played by Rutger Hauer, has no motive, even the people who LIKE the movie. Those who don't like the movie frequently harp on it's lack of realism. To really appreciate The Hitcher, you have to realize that it's a coming of age FABLE disguised as a psycho killer movie. You heard me right--a COMING OF AGE FABLE. When Rutger Hauer gets shoved out of the car at the beginning of the story, he recognizes potential in C. Thomas Howell (note the loving and amused glint in Rutger's eye) and becomes his self-appointed mentor, spending the rest of the movie educating him, passing the psycho torch as it were. This idea is consistently and brilliantly developed, climaxing (pun fully intended) in Rutger Hauer's sacrifice at the end of the movie, followed by C. Thomas Howell's obligatory \\"post-coital\\" cigarette. Frankly, it amazes me that so many so-called critics, who are paid good money to deliver a cogent and intelligent analysis, could have so completely missed the point of this movie.

B00006RU5B|4.0|From the beginning, I didn't think Cornell would fit. But there are several tracks on this CD that get me just as pumped as Rage did. But there are also some slow, jazz-like songs that I don't like too much but can respect. All in all, if you want some Rage-like songs with a Cornell twist, this album's a must have.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|With as good as the first movie was, this one is just as bad.  Not enough Tommy Lee Jones and too little story. Some nice special effects, but all that takes is money and it can't carry a film.
B000069AUI|5.0|this cd has become one of my favorite albums. i listen to it when i go to sleep and it puts me into such a state of relaxation. The Scientist, Clocks, and Warning Sign are all works of art. even though coldplay is a lot like radiohead (another amazing band) they still are original enough to keep me interested and i am really starting to love these guys.
B000075BFK|3.0|2pac's new album is okay, i felt dissapointed when they changed up the beats for his new album. This album is his weakest album out of all his albums because in his older albums, you can listen fully without skipping tracks. My favorite songs in this album are STREET FAME, GHETTO STAR, THIS LIFE I LEAD, and THEY DON'T GIVE A ...ABOUT US. <BR>p.s. be on the look out 9/13/2K3
B00006JLP4|5.0|Both my seven year old daughter and I found Lilo and Stitch to be a great movie.  I personally like it for the theme, the Elvis music, and the way the characters seem so \\"normal\\" in comparison to fairytales.  Yet, even with the real world theme, they bring in an alien and lighten the movie up with it, adding flare and comedy.  It's definately one of the best Disney movies ever made, especially because they went out on a limb a little and loosened up...used words like \\"stupid head\\" and small amounts of violence...it made me feel like my daughter wasn't getting a warped version of things for once, even with the singing alien!<BR>Also, the plot seems to help children who are from dysfunctional backgrounds, and may not relate to a fairytale.  These children need something to relate to and this movie can definately provide that for them.<BR>My daughter liked it because of the \\"cute\\" Stitch and the fact that it was staged in Hawaii, one of her favorite places.  <BR>She has it on her wish list for xmas and has been anxious for that ever since seeing it in the theater in July.<BR>BUY this MOVIE....it's GREAT!!!! sUPERB!   Fabulous, exciting, and IMPORTANT!
B00006RU5B|5.0|SO MUCH POWER, SO MUCH TALENT. YOU MUST GET IT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO IDEA ON WHAT YOUR MISSING OUT.  THERES THE SUPER ENERGETIC COCHISE TO BLOW THINGS UP, THEN SHOW ME HOW TO LIVE AND GASOLINE KICK YOU IN THE FACE. THEN YOU GET TO BEATIFUL MELODIES, WHAT YOU ARE  AND LIKE A STONE.  THEN MY FAVORITE TRACK, SHADOW ON THE SUN. AFTERWARDS COME THE BEST SONGWRITING ON THE REST OF THE SONGS, GET IT!!!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This mini rocks--it's what Private Ryan could have been (so close!).  The DVD is wonderful, with some very nice features.  Only complaint: the Field Guide intro calls WWII &quot;The War to End all Wars&quot;.  History buffs will say &quot;Oops!&quot; and move on.  You must buy this.
B00006LFGD|5.0|\\"Be My Guest,\\" appropriately enough, was the song that Judy Garland used to introduce her guests on the \\"Judy Garland Show \\" in the early 1960s. On \\"Duets,\\" Barbra Streisand struts out 17 duets sung over the course of her career (and one sung with herself ... the unfortunate \\"One Less Bell to Answer\\") with a roster of guests ranging from the impressive Garland herself to the less impressive Don Johnson. \\"Duets,\\" though a compilation of material available on other discs, is in fact a revelation for Streisand fans. This is not the Diva we've come to expect, but rather a (surprisingly) generous Streisand who helps her partners to shine. She plays the hostess with the mostess with complete grace and charm. For the best of these singers, a duet with Barbra becomes a proving ground, a badge of honor. Hers is not an unathletic sort of singing, and the vocal calisthenics she dishes out are not easily returned. But mostly, thanks to her small kindnesses, they all manage to hold their ground.<br />The collection opens with a new duet with Barry Manilow, \\"I Won't Be The One To Let Go,\\" and it proves one of the best selections here. I won't get into issues of whether or not Streisand's range is declining, or her vocal dynamic is less sonorous than it was thirty years ago. She's sixty years old, for heaven's sake. This duet is extraordinary for its level of elegant, straightforward singing by these two veterans of pop music. It's a good song, with Manilow at his best: tasteful and restrained. Streisand seems to take her cue from him, and though her performance seems to lack the kind of bravura we've grown to expect, the simplicity she brings to her singing (a few simple arpeggios) is refreshing. Not unsurpringly, she selected her duet with Barry Gibb, \\"Guilty,\\" for the second selection. Gibb managed to package all of Streisand's vocal eccentricities, and her range from torch singer to supper club entertainer, into a pure pop package. \\"Guilty\\" sounds better than ever.<br />The third entry here is the famous duet with Neil Diamond. It remains, perhaps, the most impassioned (even romantic) of all of them. It is a great combination of Streisand's incredible sound against Diamond's gruffer, nearly-spoken singing. His voice is strong enough to hold its own against her longer-held notes, her octave-high jumps and other calisthenics. This duet with Neil Diamond marks a type of duet that is typical in the overproduced, string-infested world of \\"Barbra Land.\\" She'll duet with a male singer who basically holds the line of the melody while she performs balletic vocals around him, usually providing a vocal backdrop of sheer acoustic beauty (an example would be that darn humming of hers that seems so ... sexy).  The format usually works well for her. This singing/speaking dynamic dominates her duets with Kris Kristofferson, Bryan Adams, Don Johnson, and unfortunately, Frank Sinatra.  \\"I've Got A Crush On You\\" with Sinatra is a disaster from the start, when they decided to sing in two different keys! Streisand dragged Sinatra into Barbra Land with overproduced harps and strings, new arrangements, and his aged and tired voice sounds bleak. Barbra (in her own key) wraps his charmless performance in gold ribbons. She ended up burying him. She really wouldn't do it to anyone else. Don Johnson, strangely enough, sounds great. With nothing to lose, he gamely follows where she leads.<br />Most of the singers here are pretty happy in Barbra Land. Johnny Mathis and Michael Crawford give amazing peformances. \\"Enough is Enough,\\" with Donna Summer, remains one of Streisand's and Summer's finest vocal performances-- an amazing feat of singing. The idea of female solidarity is continued with \\"Tell Him,\\" a duet with Celine Dion. Dion is clearly in thrall to Streisand, but still unwilling to let her Diva get a note in edgewise. Unfortunately, theirs is a shout-fest of sorts--with a little singing in the midst.<br />The zany, early Streisand is represented in her duet with Harold Arlen on his \\"Ding, Dong the Witch is Dead\\" from \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" It was campy then and it's campy now. Perhaps she has recognized the power of her early camp persona--it undid a generation of earlier Divas. But not Judy Garland. The Garland duet remains the center of this collection. Streisand recalled in liner notes for \\"Just For the Record\\" that when she clasped Garland's hand during the duet, the older singer was shaking. I'll bet she was. Every time something went wrong for Garland during the 1960s, her managers and producers would torment her by threatening to bring in Streisand to replace her. But if Garland was rattled, Streisand wasn't. Her singing with Garland was brilliant, even natural on this early outing--if only because Garland let her have the stage.<br />The Garland duet is placed on this compilation just before Streisand's duet with Josh Groban. Is this a passing of the torch? Don't think so. This is one of the least successful duets on the recording. It is Groban, this time, who is shaking, in fact, he seems scared stiff. In \\"All I Know Of Love,\\" Groban is given the pretentious Italian lyrics, which he performs in aria-like bursts of singing. Barbra seems to pretend he isn't there. Like the 16 singers who preceded him, he had the chance to shine, to prove himself against the big voice, but he just didn't make the cut.with Harold Arlen on his \\"Ding, Dong the Witch is Dead\\" from \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" It was campy then and it's campy now.

B00006LJ72|4.0|Was there really a need for this 4 -Cd set? Probably,yes, for those people who became fans of Enya recently and want to sum up her career up to now. But for those fans,like me,who are more than just casual fans, we already own EVERYTHING on the 4-CD set(except for the Video of &quot;Silent Night&quot;).I think every hard-core Enya fan would have been pleased to get a single CD of all of her B-sides,non-Cd tracks,etc. rather than  getting all of her singles imported.I don't understand why some things were left out(where is the hauntingly beautiful &quot;I May Not Awaken&quot;?????)while including so much material that is on all of her CD's. Will I eventually buy the 4 CD set? yes,but it is not a top priority. Instead of releasing this, why didn't they get Nicky Ryan  to finally get around to releasing Enya's video collection on DVD,which the rest of the world has had for over a year now (except the U.S. &amp; Canada) with no release date even in sight????
B000060OWV|5.0|This is one great album. Don't buy it until you have time to listen to it several times at one sitting, because you will want to play it over and over. It just sounds great. Ford's playing is crisp and smooth. His voice is a little thin for the blues, but still sounds good. Something For the Pain, Indianola, and You're Gonna Be Sorry are terrific blends of jazz, rock and blues. A lot of jazz and blues guitarists get a little out there in terms of improvisational riffs. On this album Ford plays straight ahead melodies that are fun to listen to. You'll wear out the ol' air guitar listening to this one. Enjoy.
B00006YXE4|5.0|Most of my favorite music artists are pushing retirement age, and furthermore, are looking it.  It makes me feel a bit old, it's true, but it's great that these folks are still out there, giving us some wonderful music.  <br />The advent of the DVD has made some really nice things possible.  Those of us who unfortunately did not see Mr. Clapton on his last tour have the unprecedented opportunity to have both an audio and video record of the show, in one compact, tidy package.  What a nice gift from Clapton to his fans, and what a great price.  If you are considering purchasing this new live album, you should definitely buy this package, as for just a few more dollars, you get all the tracks from the audio package, PLUS Billy Preston's Will It Go Round in Circles on a very well-filmed and recorded DVD.<br />Just a few observations: The band is great; they're all consumate pros, and certainly do not disappoint.  Guitarist Andy Fairweather/Low, keyboardist Greg Phillingames and and bassist Nathan East have been with Clapton a long time, while reletive newcomers (to Clapton's band) Billy Preston, David Sancious and Steve Gadd certainly need no introduction.  These guys are the Cream (pardon me) of session men, and provide Clapton a wonderful bed over which to lay his distictive guitar and vocals.  Clapton's dressed like your dad in his his Miami Beach best, and the band follows suit.  These guys may dress like old men, but they play like angels.<br />There are really no surprises or revelations.  Clapton rarely even speaks, preferring, I guess, to let his music do the speaking.  And it certainly does.  All the songs, but particularly the selections from Pilgrim, convey a warm, intimate feel.  The songs all sound well lived-in, and wash over you like a clear mountain stream.  The sound is very good, but sometimes the detail on the keyboards and 2nd guitar are lost.  That said, the sound is warm and inviting, making you truly feel like you are sitting in the audience.<br/>This man clearly has nothing to prove.  This is about the music, plain and simple.  One can't help notice that Clapton seems a bit detached. He rarely smiles, rarely looks at the audience, and rarely speaks.  But I guess he doesn't need to.
B000002MJR|5.0|I'm not much of a rock fan. The only Dire Staits song I was familiar with was \\"Sultans of Swing'-- which is not on this CD. But I heard \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" on an airplane audio system and I liked it so I bought this CD.   <br /> Wow! I was surprised. This is a great CD -- mellow and bluesy at times; rocking at others, with lots of great instrumentation -- horns, drums, piano, and guitar. I couldn't understand the words to any of the songs, but they sounded nice -- and if I missed the significance of any profound, life-altering lyrics, well, what the hell, I liked the music.  <br /> I liked the crowd noise (some don't) on this live album which gives an immediacy to the music and I liked the long, loose interpretations of the songs -- some of which run to about 10 minutes. Dire Straits is a top notch band. I wished I had paid attention to them 20 years ago.
B00005M989|3.0|This is a great overview of Prince but,It doesn't have rare gems or b-sides. I would buy The Hits/B-sides. This is great money to spend.
B00007E8V4|5.0|Hey, if you've been anxiously awaiting this CD as I have, you will really be happy once you fork your [$$] over for it.  Roulette has rapidly become one of my favorite System songs...  If this stuff was really supposed to be on Toxicity, I'm happy they kept it off and sent this CD out, it's great and is a welcome addition to my CD collection, right down from Audioslave :)...
B00005U122|5.0|This is how a concert Dvd should be done!  Great camera work....  Great audio....AND ABOVE ALL, NO INTERRUPTIONS!!!    Roger Waters and the band were excellent.   Great live concert.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This album is definitely Christina's best. Although I dont think it shows off her voice as much as the first album does, it does however, show her versatility.  There are tracks on this album which will appeal to everyone. There's rock, pop, ballads and R'n'B.  If people are expecting it to sound like 'Dirrty' then Im sorry to say but Dirrty is the only track on the album that has that flavour.  'Im Ok' is clearly a very personal track to Christina as it describes her personal life while she was a child (she is literally crying on this track!) 'Beautiful' &amp; 'Impossible' are very simialar tracks in terms of soul. As Impossible is writted, produced and arranged by Alicia Keys, it sound very much like her type of music (piano). 'Get mine, Get Yours' is a song about double standards and how women can get labelled but men are seen as 'studs' if they do the same thing.  'Infatuation' has a very Spanish feel to it and describes her ideal Latin Lover! Overall it is a very good album and she deserves credibility due to her writing, producing and arranging skills shown on this album.
0316666343|1.0|A friend of mine literally forced this book on me to read this weekend, raving about it.  The bad reviews here have just confirmed my own impression and I'm not going to bother finishing it.<br />The major flaws are a dull, pallid writing style and characters as flat and cliched as the cast of a fifties' sitcom.  There is not a single person in here I care about, least of all the murder victim.<br />People ask why this book is such a hit. Because many readers can't recognize decent writing and like the idea that even the most heinous tragedy can be made painfree and feel good; after all, the victim is telling her story from heaven and the people she's left behind are getting on with their lives.  If Oprah wrote fiction, this would be it.  I loved the title by one of the reviewers, 'Touched by an Elbow.'  That sums it up, perfectly. <br />Atleast, this book was lent to me.  Paying money for this?  Now that's pain.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Small, sleak, and smooth.  The PS2 memory card holds up to 8mb of memory and can save quite a bit of games to it.  Its easy to carry around to friends house or travel with.  Has your basic funtions, and if your a EA sports football fan, you'd better buy two...
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie is so awesome. It is exciting, and way cool. I had read the book twice before seeing this movie, and they are both really good. I would totally reccomend the book, too, but for people (like me) that don't really like spending their free time reading, the movie gives you a good idea of the story. This is a really awesome movie. The special effects are way cool, and the casting is totally perfect! This is a great movie to see. And, on this DVD, you could watch it again and again! Even if you're an adult, you should still see this movie. People who say Harry Potter is for kids must have never actually seen or read Harry Potter. Some of the stuff in this movie MIGHT scare kids, but, hey, it just makes the movie more exciting to have some action in it. Anyway, this is a great movie, and I totally recommend it, no matter how old you are, or wether you like or dislike the books.

B000002L7V|5.0|From the intro from metal's Ed McMann {someone introduces Dio as \\"the king of Rock and Roll\\"} through the ultimate master work - the track \\"shoot Shot\\" in which Dio sings; \\"When someone points a gun at you just say shoot shoot, I don't care anymore\\" is worth the cash load alone.  The above lyric never got Dio in legal trouble though it was out at the time of the Judas Priest hearings and the Ozzy controversies.  I am a tenth level magic user & DM in D&D.  At all D&D gatherings this record is played repeatedly.  Many folks will comment that this record is not cool because of the line up but if one listens to the entire back Dio collection one will realize that it is Dio that is Jesus & not Ozzy or any week back up band of high school drop outs.  Dio knows that good lyrics revolve around D&D, dragons, pixies, and magic.  Dio never strays from this form, thank God.  This record makes for perfect nights with the girlfriend of your dreams - if \\"magic\\" doesn't happen between a man & a woman with this record playing loudly in the backdrop then it's Viagra for you my comrade.
6301797906|3.0|This movie was almost worthy of the book, and was deserving of 5 stars, until the last 60 seconds. Then Ma Joad gives her \\"We're the people\\" speech (which ends something like \\"We're the people, and the people keep a'goin'\\" or \\"We're the people, and the people keep on\\" or something like that). Then the music track swells inspiringly, and the film ends on an upbeat note.<br />HUH? Grapes of Wrath was NOT an upbeat book. The story was one of despair, and at the end of the book the Joads were in very dire straights indeed -- no money, no food, no shelter, and Tom on the lam from the law. The ending of the movie -- which other Amazon reviewers have inexplicably praised -- completely distorted Steinbeck's message.
B000066NW0|3.0|Okay to everyone who bashed the poor girl.....did you ever stop to think that maybe she DOES know how to skateboard and she is not a poser??  Do you know her personaly to say if she can or can not?  Get a life and stop bashing others, it only makes you look imature and stupid.  If you don't like her style just simply don't listen to her, change the station...is it really that hard?  Even though she may seem a bit like pop, she has her own style and I think she is better than the puppets of the pop world that all look the same. At least she is a individual.
0880389052|5.0|This book is the amazing begining to one of the best series ever written. The dark elf trilogy books are not actually the first book's written in the series. This Trilogy is actaully a prequell to the Icewind Dale trilogy; however I would recomend you read this trilogy first, you are not going to ruin anything if you read them the other way though. I know a lot of people who have read this book and they all loved it. Character development is great esspecially Drizzt (best charcter of all time)The story is very quick theres no long dragging on boring stuff. Salvator has some of the best action scenes I have ever read. Do not skip this book take the time buy it and I promise you before you know it you will be back in the book store buying the next book.
B00007E8V4|4.0|For being nothing but a collection of out takes this album definately has a feel of its own. It has plenty of the political and psychological type tracks you've come to expect plus some other suprises. All the songs are pretty d*mned catchy and fun to listen too. Malkavian also does a lot more vocals on these songs than the other albums. Also I was suprised to find how well this is mixed. These are NO demos, these are complete studio works and a lot of the songs actually blend into eachother. The album as a whole is well produced and structured without a lot of holes that I expected to find. So dont worry about this album sounding like it was recorded in a garage. If anything these songs may even sound cleaner than most others by them. Which may or may not be so good.<br />1. Chic n' Stu: The most rockinest song about pizza ever made with a good bit of insight on the advertising industry. Pretty silly and reminds me of Weird Al even at times. Probably not the greatest opening track but deffinately more off the wall then most of thier stuff. Malkavian actually gets the first words on this album.<br />2. Innervision: apperantly this is the radio track off the collection. Its good and catchy but not really spectacular.<br />3.Bubbles: another one that may get a lot of attention. The melodies and harmonies really take front on this song. Same with a lot of the others on this cd. <br />4.BOOM!: a political song about war bonds and the tragedy that comes with supporting military actions. Children dying, families in trauma, that sort of thing. Good track, has some spoken word vocals which is new to the band and isnt really heard in the other albums. Good track with a catchy chanting chorus.<br />5. NuGuns: I think this song is about the right to bare arms in the US. Pretty much explains that weapons are used more likely to kill than to defend ones self. The music is really great too.<br />6. A.D.D.: This may be the most political song on the album. About how most civiliansfeel about thier government and how the government makes it seem as if its people are backing everything they do through the media when in fact \\"we dont give a [darn] about your world and drunken power\\". One of the best songs on the album. Makes you want to protest something.<br />7. Mr. Jack: I think this song is about a drug bust or something that has to do with undercover officers. Bassically stating the oppinion that cops are pointing guns with no real reason too. Kind of slow. Good song but not too great.<br />8. I-E-A-I-A-I-O: This song could very well include Surge ranting faster than any other song they've ever done. Each verse is a total tongue twister reminiscent of 'Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Pickled Peppers' with some political twists in it. Nice dramatic chorus. Yet another keeper.<br />9. 36: less than a minute long. Nothing speacial. Pretty angry. I dont mind it much but it leads right into...<br />10. Pictures: I have no clue really what this song is about. I should probably have listened to the album more before reviewing it. I'll guess it has to do with reality TV and how stupid it is. <br />11. Highway Song: Im not too into this one. I was never too into 'needles' either though so maybe im just choosey.<br />12. ... the System: Nice cheesey song with a lot of nonsense vocals. Serge sings in his silly voice throughout with '...the system' every now and then.<br />13. Egobrain: Acoustic SoaD! This is actually a really nice song. I like it a lot and its another one of the tracks on this album that is totaly unlike anything on thier other albums. I like it.<br />14-16. Thetawaves, roulette and streamline are all probably the most personal songs by SoaD. They all blend into eachother and seem to be about personal relationships rather than society or spirituality. Great way to end an album. 3 closing songs.<br />All and all I'd say that you should get this cd. Its full of great songs and really could classify as the 3rd SoaD album. I think the reasonthese songs didnt make it to the albums was because they didnt fit the theme rather than they weren't good enough, because some of my favorite songs are on this cd now.<br />Buy it...  Enjoy.

B00005JL3A|2.0|You know I have heard a lot of people love this movie, but when I watched it I was utterly dissapointed.  I have played every Resident Evil game that has came out and I loved every single one of them.  One of the things I liked about the game was the well developed plot.  This movie does a horrible thing to that plot.  First the movie is about a a virus that allows the dead to come to life as zombies that wander lifelessly feeding off human flesh.  First the mansion would have been better left off the movie entirly it served no purpose other than to give us a few glimpses.  Whatever they did to the police teams was atrocious and it still leaves me confused.  The movie throws you into a situation where the police are holding people hostage during a raid on the house.  I must say the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent special effects, but they do not make up for the mutilated and awkward plot that was created.
B00006CXXU|5.0|... The tracks are all original. Inventive and artistic. Her voice is amazingly powerful and strong. She sings with authentic passion hardly inherent on other 'artists'. She is honest. Well, thats what the album is all about. Stripped. One has to let go of so many coatings and trappings in order for our true genuine essence to flourish. Thats what Christina did. And thats what we must do. Rock on!
0451160916|4.0|I watched the movie before I ever had read the book and the only thing I hated about the movie was the lack of details.  When I found King had wrote the book I bought it immediately knowing King is the king of details.  The book is about a family that is hired to take care of a hotel, in the desolate winter desert.  King introduces us to a almost supernatural type of cabin fever that takes place and the young boy that possesses some type of supernatural power.  The tension mounts and the book always keeps you wondering.  A great read for anybody who enjoys suspense and horror.
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is so beautiful.  The most psychadelic of their albums no question, this album is also Tool at their peak.  It's like they took too much acid and then wrote all of their songs...maybe that's why so few think of it as their masterpiece...it's at such a maginificent height that it's hard to comprehend...<BR>It's beautiful, give it a chance and you'll love it.  It's no question my favorite album of all time.
630503723X|3.0|While I lived in France, I had a chance to see this film in it's uncut verison. I had thought by buying this DVD, that I had in fact had the orginal uncut film. Not quite! I was somewhat disappointed by the missing/removed parts which were very important to this film. I hope this is of some help to you?
B00007E8V4|5.0|Following up on Toxicity, System of a down comes out firing with Steal this album. Although i found the first two Cd's better, This is a f**kin awesome CD. Metal fans, BUY THIS ALBUM!! F- the system!
B00005JKJA|5.0|True to form, David Lynch has directed another controversial masterpiece that is will stun and shock some, absorb and mesmerize others, and infuriate and frustrate the rest. It is a film that will elicit strong and binary reactions: few will rate this movie as \\"average\\" or simply \\"OK\\". Like the rare novel that lurks in the fringes of your subconscious, \\"Mulholland Drive\\" will not easily go away. And like great poetry, \\"MH\\" succeeds not in telling a story, but in leaving sufficient doubt to provoke and stimulate, forcing the viewer read between the lines and to insert their own conclusions.<br /><br />The plot? Suffice to say it is a story of love gone bad, of murder, deceit, and humanity at the depraved pinnacle of Hollywood sleaze. Complicated, nonlinear, convoluted, and garish, it is definitely not your average big screen tale of good guys and bad guys with simple, happy (or even conclusive) ending. It includes the patented Lynch surrealism bouncily freely from dream to reality. While initially the actors seem to be playing their roles like some bizarre \\"Father Knows Best\\"-on-acid 1950's camp, by the end, it all (well, most all), begins to make sense, and the bizarre behavior falls nicely into the ultimate story line.<br />If you're looking for a simple, linear, mind-numbing piece of eye-candy, don't come here. There are plenty of one-star reviews to read that capture the frustration and absence of coherency many will feel. But if you want to give your brain a workout in 21st century noir, and enjoy watching a film a second (or third) time to pick up the pieces missed the first time around, \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is your ride.
0812550706|3.0|This is not going to be a popular opinion, but I didn't like this book and can't figure out why it's such a classic.  Basically, genius kid is recruited by interplanetary military and trained in the art of war so that he can destroy an alien species deemed to be a threat to earth.  Meanwhile, back on earth, genius brother and sister of genius kid post op-ed pieces on the internet and quickly attain worldwide followings and more or less control world politics.  These are all little kids, and they don't get much older in the course of the book.<br />There are two main problems for me. First, I don't like books where the characters end up being world political leaders and changing the course of history.  Most books with this kind of plot are incapable of capturing the charisma and brilliance that such people actually have, and so I'm never really convinced that these characters could have accomplished these great feats.  That's the case here, too.  There just wasn't anything about the kids - other than that they didn't sound like little kids when they talked - that seemed especially brilliant or interesting or charismatic, or that could have enabled them to accomplish the things they did.  There was a bit more effort in that area with Ender, but his brother and sister seemed completely unconvincing to me.  There was no way in which they didn't sound like ordinary people.  <br />The most interesting part of the story was Ender's trials at battle school, where his teachers manipulated him into isolation from his friends.  The detailed descriptions of his victories gave some small credence to the claim that he was intelligent, but nevertheless were not overly shocking in their brilliance.  Still, this part of the book was pretty interesting and kept me reading.  It wasn't until the last quarter of the book, where all the kids wound up being world famous leaders and changing history, that I was annoyed at the silliness and unlikelihood of that.  <br />The second problem Ihad with the book is that as sci-fi I didn't find it speculative or original enough.  It was an action-driven book with a relatively simplistic inter-species war theme, and a less than surprising \\"surprise\\" ending. I don't want to give it away for those who might actually enjoy this book, but I'll just say that the whole thing was just not very sophisticated sci-fi. If the kind of sci-fi you like is more along the lines of Vernor Vinge or Neil Stephenson, complex and speculative, then this is probably not the book for you.
B000070WJE|3.0|Is this Robbie's big American breakthrough album?  I don't think so.  The tunes aren't as<BR>immediately catchy as some of his earlier stuff, but it does sound more American - more<BR>Californian really - which isn't surprising in view of the time he's been spending in LA. <BR>In fact, some of the references might alienate his UK fans - does anyone outside of<BR>California know where El Segundo is?.  Still, Robbie is Robbie, the music reflects his<BR>charm and is even touching at times - and anything that makes you smile is worth a listen,<BR>isn't it?  So, a transitional album; let's hope the next one is the charm.

6304500831|5.0|Walt Disney died when this animated movie was still being made. And it was released in 1967, months after Disney's death. And animated movies all started with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. And this movie is kind of like both Tarzan and George of the Jungle all in one. As the movie opens, a panther named Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot) finds a lost man cub all along in the jungle. So he brings the baby to a pack of woods and about a few years later the baby now growing into about 5 maybe 10 years old man cub named Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman). But Mowgli has to go to a man village because a tiger named Shere Khan has return to the jungle and is going to kill Mowgli because he hates hunters with gun and fire. But Mowgli wants to stay in the jungle, and finally Bageera gives up a lets him be on his own. And he meets a bear named Baloo (Phil Harris). Shere Khan is not in the mvoie until about the middle to end of the movie. So little time for a villian if Shere Khan is a  villain.
0066214122|4.0|I read this book over two days.  It's definitely a page-turner in the same league as The Andromeda Strain or Jurassic Park.  But best of all, it gets down to the science of &quot;science fiction&quot; in ways I think some of his other novels (Disclosure, The Lost World) seem to have neglected.  While it's not &quot;hard science fiction&quot; (e.g., the sample computer code in the novel doesn't even make an attempt at looking like a recognizable programming language), it has enough scientific detail to keep the SF fan interested.  The characters are also surprisingly well-thought-out, especially for a Crichton novel (where the characters are normally not nearly as important as the concepts).  All in all, I would recommend this book to SF fans who were interested in a good read, or any reader who is interested in being introduced to Crichton's writing.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This album is a composition of B sides, from 1995-2001. This album is everything you expect from the LA based Armeinan metal group, but is missing quite a few B side songs including:<br />1: Metro (a Berlin cover)<br />2: Snowblind (a Black Sabbath cover)<br />3: Blue<br />4: Dam<br />5: Johnny (Really weird great song)<br />6: Shame (a compilation cover with Wu Tang)<br />7: Legend of Zelda (Yes, a nintendo game cover)<br />Innervision was the first single on this album. Produced by Rick Rubin, who is one of the best producers ever, and Daron Malakin, (lead guitarist). These songs were revamped from originals after Daron was mad that B sides were being shared online, and sounding terrible. Remixed and produced, this album of 16 tracks proves to be a little hint where System is going musically. There are at least four different \\"covers\\" for this album...It's worth every cent!
6304698658|5.0|I've watched this at LEAST once (usually two to three times!) every year since it came out and I love it!It has no dull moments, it's completely relevant, and it never fails to get to me till I'm in pain from laughing!I'd call that a &quot;Classic!&quot;
B0000669JL|4.0|THe original reggae pioneer Bob marley.  The album pretty much explains itself.... all the hits.  Great way to get into Bob Marley if your just startin to get into him, and a great cd if your not new but want all the hits on one cd.
B000075BFK|5.0|This CD is the best.  Almost all the songs are good.  I you are a Pac fan You'll luv it. You GOT to have this one.
B00000J7J4|3.0|The first pop release from the legendary santana. As always the guitar guru blows the mind with his skills. But this time around he brings some friends for the ride... Lauryn hill, everlast, dave matthews band, rob thomas etc. Some of the songs are pretty catchy and well produced such as \\"maria maria\\", and \\"Turn the lights on\\" with everlast.  Personally im more a fan of his older releases, but respect the decision of progression.  If your looking for a classic santana album this is not for you, if your just getting into santana then this is good to ease you in.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Mark keeps it sharp and to the point in \\"The Ragpicker's Dream\\". Knopfler continues to paint pictures so vivid - stories of  relationships, a foreign man working in a foreign land..etc. Very roots-oriented and downright great music. MK plays with a range of different emotions, and gets down having fun in doing so. Also, I marvel at the way he plays guitar. He's one artist playing genuine music. My favs on this album are \\"Why Aye Man\\", \\"Hill Farmer's Blues\\" and \\"Coyote\\". One of the best albums of 2002, along with so many others. Peace - JG
B00005NTN5|4.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time!  If you don't particularly like lesbian love scenes, then you might want to skip the beginning, but if you do, enjoy!  Wow!  Two gorgeous ladies make a steamy, sweltering love scene.<br />Aside from that, this is a great gangster movie.  After the beginning the focus is on what happens to the mob money.  The end becomes a game of cat and mouse you will not soon forget!

B000067J1H|5.0|It is seldom that a movie comes along that leaves such an impact. This is why I believe that \\"Fight Club\\" is one of the best movies ever. It is a movie that lays out some philisophical ideas about life, yet the audience doesn't have to believe in them in order to see what the writer and director are trying to say. But the movie isn't just that. The story is layered, and all elements to the story hold significance. The character named Marla (unlike in most movies) is not a love interest that is only used to increase running time nor to add spice. Marla plays a much bigger part in the story than even Marla (and the audience) knows. At the beginning of the movie Edward Norton says, \\"thats when I realized, the bomb, the gun, the revolution, had something to do with a woman named Marla Singer\\". Most audience members forget these lines the first time around, that's why audience members may think that its all about Tyler Durtent's philosophy. Tyler Durdent's philosophy is unique, truthfull, but flawed at times. The movie takes note of this when Edward (\\"Jack\\") is caught as the only guy with common sence. So you can't say it's a movie that pushes a belief. The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions and begs to be viewed many times. Audience members may draw their own conclusion on \\"Fight Club\\". Yet in the end one thing is certain, all \\"Jack\\" wants is Marla, and that has nothing to do with Tyler. Ebert thought this movie was \\"silly\\", Berardenelli called it a modern day \\"Clockwork Orange\\". Not everyone will understand, but the ones that do will love this movie.
B00006M183|5.0|It's amazing how every negative review of this album was written within two days of it's release. It's as if the reviewer listened to the album once, maybe twice, then passed judgement on it. An absolute sin for a record reviewer.<br />Upon first listen, Riot Act sounds good, but not great. There is no &quot;breakout single&quot; on this record. So what? I don't need a major radio hit to convince me that an album is good. I want an album that is good from start to finish, not just a record with one track that I can listen to over and over again. Riot Act is a solid rocker all the way through. You just have to give it a few listens to realize it. The only negative thing I can even say about this record is that &quot;Thumbing My Way&quot; and &quot;Arc&quot; are out of place and could have easily been tossed into the B-Side pile. This CD is in constant rotation in my carousel. It absolutely rocks.<br />If you are still complaining that Pearl Jam doesn't put out records that sound like &quot;Ten&quot;, you need to shut up and go play &quot;Ten&quot; again. You are not a Pearl Jam fan. You are a &quot;Ten&quot; fan.
B00006RAKP|4.0|This was apparently released to cash in on the compilation craze, that began with The Beatles: 1, and continues with Elvis: Number One Hits. <br />It is sad that they didn't spend a  l -i -t -t -l -e  time searching for the original masters, and cleaning them up a bit.  The sound is just okay.  Maybe someday they'll get someone like Steve Hoffman to work his magic on these songs.
B00004D3C1|3.0|Look this is listenable but I find it a bit to monotonous. The music is very laughable for what reason I can't pin down. Would not expect you to enjoy this CD if your a fan of Kyuss or Orange Goblin. Has a more garage rock sound. Personally I suggest you skip Fu Manchu. Now if you can find Cuda (two of the members from Bongzilla, a real stoner rock band) then you will see what Fu Manchu only wishes they could be.
B00005NB0H|5.0|After wrapping up their North American Tour in 1969 (including a performance at Woodstock), The Who were eager to get home and unwind. 'Live At Leeds' was recorded at Leeds University for that purpose - to give people a taste of the band at their ease, live. This &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; features all the songs they played (although 'Tommy' is resequenced to fit on one disc, annoyingly) that night, and it is, quite simply, the best live performance ever.<br />The Who played with such a relentless energy live that they were simply electric. While the Rolling Stones (the only band on the same level at the time) kept their roots firm in a languid menacing blues-rock until around 1975, the Who were unforgiving in their straight-sliced hard-edged violent rock'n'roll. Keith Moon's wild flailing at his drum kit was evenly tempered by John Entwhistle's stoic stance on the stage, efficiently pumping out the only 'lead bass' lines in rock'n'roll. Pete Townshend's guitar lines were free to be as wild as they need, not so much anchored by the rhythm section so much as bolstered. Rodger Daltrey's voice screamed and rattled, the inspiration for countless hard rockers to come. While these seemingly irreconcilable differences would tear them apart as time went on, in 1969 they were unstoppable.<br />Live At Leeds opened with John Entwhistle's &quot;Heaven And Hell&quot;, which is classic Who - rattling drums, rollicking bass lines, killer guitar. This feeling of bare rock'n'roll extends to such a powerful extent that even older rock standbys like &quot;Fortune Teller&quot; and blues standards like &quot;Eyesight To The Blind&quot; and &quot;Young Man Blues&quot; get the infectious hard-rock treatment. Reviews of this show tell of how the crowd stood for two hours straight, electrified right down to the epic ten-minute-plus version of &quot;My Generation&quot;, which slides almost miraculously into &quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot; (the finale of &quot;Tommy&quot;) and an inspired guitar-drenched finale in which Pete Townshend literally plays off of his own echo from the rear wall. The Who had by that time perfected the rock opera 'Tommy', and while the performance at the Isle Of Wight does have more energy behind it, this version isn't anything to sneeze at, either.<br />The Who in 1969 were at their peak in terms of live performances. And while their studio work would go on to be better and better ('Who's Next' in 1971, 'Quadrophenia', their masterpiece, in 1973), this is the best you'll ever hear them live. And, as a result, it may well be the best, most raw, most powerful live performance ever.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Johnny Cash is at his best when he is telling stories through his music.  This CD has some really good ones starting with the title track &quot;The Man Comes Around&quot;, which is based on the account of the four horseman of Revelation.  Other good stories can be found in &quot;Give My Love To Rose&quot; and &quot;Streets Of Laredo&quot;.<br />As he has on the previous American Recordings CDs, Cash tackles some interesting covers, most notably &quot;Hurt&quot; from Nine Inch Nails and &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; from Depeche Mode.  On the surface, these sound really odd, but in that way that only the Man in Black can do, he makes them work.<br />The low points of the CD are &quot;Sam Hall&quot; and &quot;Danny Boy&quot;.  In contrast to the melodic and touching covers of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; and &quot;First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, &quot;Sam Hall&quot; is terribly out of place.  Not every cover that Cash attempts works out, and that is the case with &quot;Danny Boy&quot;.  With those two exceptions, though, it is an excellent effort.<br />The instrumentation is simple.  If you enjoyed the way the songs were done when Cash teamed up with Willie Nelson on VH1 Storytellers, you will like these songs.  I recommend this CD to anyone wanting to try something new.  You will not come away disappointed.
0066214122|5.0|Jack Forman didn't think it could happen to him, he was a leader in the programming field, with a team of young programmers at the hottest company in the field, but to his surprise he was let go, given no choice by the company bigwigs who used Jack as the fall-guy in the shady dealings that were going on.<br />Now, a house-husband, Jack is getting the kids ready for school, taking his son to soccer practice, and getting their meals ready while his wife Julia is working for Xymos, a leader in the technology field.  Things are okay for awhile, but slowly Julia starts to change...her moods change fast and furiously, and she gets home from work later and later, until an accident sends Jack on a mission to uncover the truth about his wife, and the company she works for.<br />Taking a job for Xymos, Jack begins probing fellow employees for information on the company, but nothing could prepare him for what he finds at the lab in Nevada, a lab where a techno/bio experiment has gone horribly wrong.<br />Jack and a group of researchers become trapped in the lab by an unidentified force, a force driven by the lust for flesh, a swarm-like force known as PredPrey.  <br />As the swarm keeps the group captive, Jack and his workers find out the swarm is of the utmost intelligence, and it was man-made.  Xymos is the behind this creation, and Jack's wife Julia may be a key player in this nightmare.<br />Jack and his workers must do battle in a war where the swarm must be destroyed, or mankind as we know it will never be the same.<br />`Prey' is an awesome thriller; fast-paced, expertly written, with a nightmare plot ripped from today's headlines.  From page one you are held captive as the plot twists and turns, never exposing too much, until halfway through where all the secrets start coming together.  The book keeps picking up speed to the exciting, surprising climax.<br />What can be said about Michael Crichton...the man is a genius, he takes a what if plot and makes it totally believable.  As in his other novels, Mr. Crichton keeps the reader stunned with every turn of the page.<br />This is DEFINITE MUST READ NOVEL!<br />Nick Gonnella
B00005JKPF|5.0|Following in the tradition of great movie sequels like THE GODFATHER PART 2, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and T2, the sequel to Marvel's action blockbuster X-MEN looks set to not only outdo the original in terms of incredible action, great characters and amazing special effects, but also reach the heights of a \\"Better than the first one\\" sequel. And like many series, this one looks set to be much darker in tone than the first one. Almost all the cast have returned; Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Halle Berry as Storm and Ian McKellen as the metal-moving menace Magneto. According to the previews, the action ante has been considerably \\"Upped\\". Fans who were disappointed at the first one in terms of nose-bleeding excitement will be happily surprised says Director Brian Singer. Singer has also said that this one will centre more on the other mutants in the first one (Rather than just Wolverine) and introduce some great characters from the comics including Nightcrawler, Beast, Gambit, Jubilee and Iceman. Fans (Myself included) are very excited about what looks set to be one of the most amazing films of 2003. That said, the first X-MEN was a great action film, and the ever-present law of diminishing returns is a major factor. But with such a great ensemble of talent on board, this one looks like a bonafide winner.
B000002UJQ|5.0|a truly great cd, in fact, i think it could be one of the greatest ever. buy now.
B00005B36H|5.0|To start off Lateralus is almost 80 minutes of great music.  When i first listen to it i knew something was there but i couldn't grasp what was going on.(thank god) After each listen i felt the musicianship of the band grow on me.  Hearing Adam's guitar and Justin's base, mix and match im astounded.  Then Carey's drums are like no others, octopus style, unique beats.  Each have their solos through-out the album and then come together showing their true musical talent as a band with lead vocalist Maynard to form what can only be TOOL.  Maynard's voice on this album gives power and emotion which in turn makes his lyrics sincere and to me inspirational(ex.  Lateralus - &quot;...ride the spiral to the end and you may just go where no ones been...spiral out, keep going...&quot;).  I'm not going to express how i feel about each song, you get your own fulfillment.  What i can say about the album as a whole is that we are human beings, we are emotional, why hide what we really are. I hope you phathom the power to get Tools album Lateralus and experience it.
B00005RFAI|3.0|Pink can really sing, better than most singers out there right now. &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot; is a tight a** album, she shows her vocal range, vocal talent, and vocal ability on it. That CD automaticly gets 5 starz from me. But &quot;M!SSUNDAZTOOD&quot; only gets three from me. To me, she only shows her her talent on a couple of songs, &quot;Family Portrait&quot; which is the best song on the album (the most R&amp;B-esque), &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot; &amp; &quot;Get The Party Started (Remix) (which isn't even on the album, but is tied into it). She should really consider switching back to her R&amp;B style. People fail to realise that Pink's only SOLO single #1 (in the U.S.) came from her R&amp;B stage! &quot;Most Girls&quot; hit #1. NONE of the singles off of her current album have broke into the top 3.<BR>(GTPS hit #4, DLMGM hit #6, JLAP hit #8)* I'm certain.<br />Please don't take this review the wrong, I'm not a hater, as a matter of fact Pink is in my top 10 female singers. It's hard for me to write negatively about her, believe me. But, If she still continues to make music in the Rock/Pop genre, and I like at least some of it, I will support her to the fullest! :) <BR> <BR>3 STARZ

0792841344|5.0|If you want to see Phantasm, I highly suggest that you rent it or buy it for DVD instead of VHS. The DVD, has so many extra features, including lobby cards, behind the scenes, commentary, the Phantasm theme song, which is the disco version. I listen to it so many times because it is so good. There are many more features as well. Well, the movie is good itself. A boy, Mike, is living with his brother. He goes into a graveyard one day and is just hanging around riding his bike, and stuff like that. He than sees a man, a very tall one, lifting a casket into the truck which is extremely heavy. The boy wonders how this man can be so strong. He also wonders why the man is taking the casket AWAY from the graveyard. This puzzles the boy. That is only the beginning of his horror. Stuff happens such as monsters in his room, ghouls, and dont forget the flying balls! I don't want to give to much away  but this movie is definetly 5 stars. *****
B000002BBY|5.0|I was watching Robbie williams singing the other night, all of the sudden he started singing the cover \\"WONDERWALL\\".<BR>Well you hear tousands of robbie williams fans singing along with him the whole stadium. .......I gives you chills just to hear it. you can even feel the emotion in the air. <br />this album is recognized by millions of people no matter where you live. Instead of playing the british anthem in soccer games they really need to play wonderwall, the new brit anthem.<br />It tells me that this album broke all the barriers. This album started all the brit scene. it was my interest in rock and roll, while you were listening to boy bands and absurd rock, we were listening to a movement that still goes on. Oasis is the driver of this bus, it gave us the chance to listen to placebo blur coldplay and many others. It taught us that rock is not about how you look, or how cool you look in leather pants while you music stinks and have no structure, or how bad you look with a baseball cap and full of tatooes, while you music is already forgotten. is all about good old rock and roll. I am so tired of listening people say they look like the beatles, but really they i am sure have just about the same greatness. Listen what all the reviews tell you really, and get it because you will love this one forever!  <br />Yes SOME MIGHT SAY they are very arrogant but they made the music to back it up. <BR>BEST band in the world[well placebo is behind them a bit]
B00006M183|3.0|A Riot Act. People Riot for several reasons. To loot. To commit crimes they wouldn't commit alone. A mob makes people feel powerful. When your five hundred you feel bigger and greater. A riot can ensue for many reasons. Mainly it grows from a dissatisfaction with ones station in life, judicial practices, civil inequity. One begins to grow tired of the hypocrisy of life and the government. On the cover we are greeted by a king and queen who have been killed and left as bones it seems after a riot of the people. Who were probably dissatisfied by their government. Is this a message to Mr. Bush? Maybe. <br />This record  is  a riot act. Not to say it's entirely political, it's not. It seems eddie focuses on all the right things in this record. Only eddie can get away with such lyrics as &quot;It's been said so many times, but can't be said enough, all you need is love.&quot; I believe him. His simple harmony and slurred voice just say it so honestly that you would follow him down that road. This  record for Pearl Jam is a ressurrection from the decent but nothing special Binaural, and  does not  give in to today's standards in music.  Pearl Jam has always written music from the soul that drives the band. There are reasons why they have lasted as long as they have. Since their debut many bands  have  come and gone and yet they strive in success (on tour not television) Fans remain true because the band has remained true to the fans. There are many gems on this record that remind me of the best songs on Binaural such as Thin Air and Nothing as it Seems. Pearl Jam has always been a mix of the mellow and harder rock of yester-year. <br />I have taken a bit of a hiatus from PJ's songs and have returned to this record with a renewed love for the band. Every song has it's own hook that I simply adore. It's an album with heart and  honesty written all over it. It touches on some political aspects facing the world today and although PJ has always seemed disconnected from the world, and in a world all their own, they emerge briefly to comment on Mr. Bush and the politics of our Post 9/11 world. This is a band that has a history and legs to continue just like Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones, etc. <br />This record continues  their legacy and it's something they should be proud of.<br />If you are new to PJ. Check out their other records and maybe a live bootlegg or two.<br />For more polital thoughts in LP form. Check out<BR>Project 86:Truthless Heroes

B00006YXEK|5.0|It's pure paradox, the last and the best album with a very clear and rich sound. Is just George. A great R'n'B production, fresh and clear. Everybody talks about Lennon's lyrics, but, did anybody stop to listen, I mean, really listen what Harrison said? Is just humanity, is poetry, living poetry talking about life and its meaning, even the cover he makes of \\"Devil and the Deep Blue sea\\" fits like a glove in this album. Is the deepness of a soul that knows that's leaving the case where spent all those years knowing that will remain - as we all - forever. Is a witty, sarcastic, deep, funny, loving record. Not for tumb seekers, not for people hungry for a death myth, is music to understand a little bit more the meaning of life. Thank you George, God bless you
6302516919|5.0|This was a great movie based on the book by Stephen King. A guy, which I think is a dork, found a car, Christine, at a junkyard and fell in love with it right away. He insisted on buying it. And that's what he did. His parents were angry with him, which was the beignning of this car madness. He got mad at them, of coarse. Soon he gets a hot girlfriend that his best friend likes and Christine gets mad because he loves someone else. That stops soon, cuz he begins to fall for Christine and reject his girlfriend. He seems to hate everyone, except Christine. Then, when Christine gets dented or something, it can go back to new. This movie sounded stupid to me at furst, but I rented it ayways. I really don't like cars and I wondered how a car could be scary.But I was wrong. It turned out to be one of my favorotes! So, see it!
B00005JLIU|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie as a kid and now as a bid kid.  Wholesome entertainment with an actual plot, good acting and singing.  I never tire of watching this film.  Recommend to all!
0151006903|3.0|&quot;I don't know what to make of my life,&quot; Baudelino tells historian Niketas upon rescuing from the sack of Constantinople in 1204.  He then proceeds to relate the entire story, hoping that an outside listener can provide him with some clarity.<br />I really wanted to like this book better than I did.  I generally love the combination of history and fantasy, and the middle ages is one of my favourite time periods.  But a lot about _Baudolino_ left me cold.  While there were portions of the book where the writing really flowed and was quite engaging, as in the lyrical descriptions of Baudolino's love affairs, there were whole chapters that seemed to be no more than lists of wonders -- as one character said, &quot;If I hear one more thing about topaz, I'm going to throw up!&quot; I had a very hard time relating to any of the characters;  they seemed very two-dimensional.  And the middle parts of the book appeared to me to be a bunch of only vaguely related events that only served to pad out the number of pages.  I know that life often seems to be made up of random events without much relationship to each other until seen from the persepctive of time, and I know that this is in a large portion what _Baudolino_ was about, but the read was not enjoyable until the last two or three chapters when things began to come together.  I truly shared Baudolino's experience of slogging ahead on an arduous journey in order to reach the revelations of the last pages, but I really prefer my books to be more entertaining.<br />If you're looking for another _Name of the Rose_ or Foucault's Pendulum_, this isn't it.

B00006FDCD|5.0|This was one of the best horror movies I ever saw. It had a good story, good cast, and good scenes. It's about a group of kids in a club called \\"The Losers Club\\" and are constantly being picked on by class bullies. They all begin to be stalked by a killer clown, which is really light. The clown's name is Pennywise and he has been around for thousands of years terrorizing and killing innocent children. The kids finally kill the clown and that day, they vow that if IT ever comes back, they will return to kill it. <br />And IT does come back. 30 years later. Then they have to kill IT, before IT kills them. <br />I dont want to give anymore away, that would just ruin the story for you. <br />When you watch the movie, be sure to look for the character Stan! Isn't he hot?
0385720920|4.0|\\"Choke\\" may not be Chuck Palahniuk's best novel, but it's certainly his funniest.  His previous novels had their moments of humor, but \\"Choke\\" really turns it up a notch.  This book's graphic, nihilistic prose and Palahniuk's talent for coming up with the perfect sentence had me laughing almost nonstop throughout.  Of course, since this is a Chuck Palahniuk novel, there's also a message buried below the strange plot and twisted humor.<br />\\"Choke\\"'s hero, Victor Mancini, isn't really a hero at all.  Rather, he's a brilliantly crafted antihero, who seems to represent the cynicism and aimlessness that are often associated (rightly or not) with gen-xers.  He's a med school dropout who works a horrific job at a simulated colonial farm, goes to sex-addiction workshops to pick up chicks, feigns choking in restaurants to get people to send him money, and spends time assuaging his guilt by visiting his mentally deteriorating mother in the hospital.  Oh, and he just might be the Messiah.  To go with Victor, Palahniuk has also assembled a memorable supporting cast: there's Denny, Victor's chronic-masturbator friend; the collection of stoners who work with him at the farm; and Paige Marshall, the \\"Doctor\\" who lets Victor in on the secrets contained in his mother's diary.  Or does she?  In Palahniuk's world, the next big surprise might be just a page away.<br />\\"Choke\\" may also be the easiest of Pahlaniuk's novels to get into.  The pacing is quick, and there are enough savagely funny scenes to keep you turning the pages to get to the next one.  In between the funny parts, though, there's plenty of Palahniuk's typical examination of identity, perception, and societal roles.  I think that's what I like most about Palahniuk's fiction: it's highly funny and eminently readable, but often thought-provoking at the same time.  I really don't think you can go wrong with any Palahniuk novel, but I would put \\"Choke\\" and \\"Invisible Monsters\\" at the top of my list.  Highly recommended.

0767830555|5.0|Director Martin Scorsese (hot off of his critical breakthrough Mean Streets) directed this film that was destined to become an all time landmark in American cinema, and announced to the world the acting genius of Robert De Niro.  De Niro plays psychotic cabbie Travis Bickle; an ex-Marine who takes a job driving a taxi because he can't sleep.  He is driven to be a vigilante by seeing the ceaspool the city has become, while trying to protect a young prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her pimp (Harvey Keitel).  Screenwriter Paul Schrader wrote the character of Travis Bickle so vividly, and De Niro perfectly captures the essence of this psychotic man living in a world decaying around him.  Peter Boyle, Cybil Sheppard, and Albert Brooks also star, and look for Scorsese in a small role as a man following his cheating wife (the exchange between him and De Niro has quite a lasting effect).  DVD extras include some interviews and trailers, but I would have loved to hear a commentary from Scorsese and/or De Niro.  All in all, Taxi Driver may not be for everyone, but those who have never gotten the chance to see this should consider seeing it.  The final ten minutes are some of the most gripping and chilling scenes in all of American cinema.
B00003CXAY|5.0|i'm writing a review because<BR>i think these movies are brilliant cultural critique,<BR>brilliant sweeping history, and some of the most beautiful art objects i've witnessed in my lifetime.<BR>and there are these people with their reviews at the top. whine ing and moaning about some kind of cropping or something. obviously spoiled and useless. . . if they really cared they'd tell everyone how wonderful these films are  because they could actually make a strong and important difference in a deteriorating world if they were introduced more widely into the mass disgusting marketplace. <BR>and if the people in the mass disgusting marketplace (see amazon) weren't all worried about nit-picky and obsessive spoiled rotten crap .  . . and were actually worried about the planet and the rotting mental environment of 3 or 4 destructive consumer-oriented generations.
B00006AUIG|1.0|This movie is really boring. It's not good on atmophere, it has lousy acting, and terrible script and well this movies reeks on all levels. It is almost as dumb as Jack-O. This is not worth seeing, buying, or renting. You'll be a better person for not seeing this movie. Trust me you're not missing anything. Go back to the slasher flicks, because they are even more interesting than this moad of ...! Even Faust is a better choice than this load of filth!
0375414053|4.0|An exhausting but very good read. As a single childless woman it made me simultaneously want/never want children and want/never want to get married!! As confused as I felt about those issues, the book did help me realize I never want the kind of life Kate has...no matter what choices I make in the future.<br />As far as the writing style, it's breezy and laugh out loud funny, and although it's a long book you can finish it in a few days. You can really picture Kate and her family/coworkers/etc. and you want to know what happens to them even after the book ends...Kate is really fleshed out as a three-dimensional character. You are equally sympathetic and frustrated with her, much like friends in real life!<br />But more than being a critique on the never-ending \\"can you have it all?\\" debate, I think this book serves as a testament to how materialistic and competitive so much of our society has become. Gone are the simple pleasures like dinner with a family or a good book. Everything in Kate's World has to be bigger, better, more expensive, faster etc. And I don't think it's just because she has guilt over feeling like she's not there for her kids. I think it's because our world is getting out of control, valuing all the wrong things (at one point, Kate ruminates over the fact that no one -- not even the men in her office -- get home in time to have dinner with their kids).<br />I think one scene that best illustrates this problem is one where Kate is having friends over for a Sunday lunch. In an attempt to impress them, she insists on trying to cook a fancy meal from scratch. She also plans to wear a Donna Karan sweater. Of course in the craziness that is Kate's life, she ruins the meal and the sweater and the day is a bust. Why didn't she just wear jeans and a T-shirt and order a pizza for pete's sake?

B000002NHN|5.0|I first heard Loreena McKennitt's song The Highwayman a couple of years ago in my English GT class, due to the fact that the words were written by the poet Alfred Noyes. I can tell you that I was just blown away! Her songs are incredibly different from today's pop and rap culture and instead derive from ancient roots that are just as haunting today. I have heard most of Ms. McKennitt's other CDs but Book of Secrets (which is the one I own) is the best! Especial favorites on the CD are Marco Polo because of its earthy, Eastern tones and Night Ride Across the Caucasus.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie goes on my top ten list.  Black Hawk Down is a great movie and if you haven't seen it yet I'm going to tell you to buy it NOW!  It is sad and tells the story that didn't really get out.  First I heard the movie was going to be pretty gory so I read the wonderful book by Mark Bowdin (highly recommended) and that book was awesome so I just had to see the movie.  The movie was pretty gory like I had heard but it tells and shows you what happened and how it must of felt like being there in Somalia on the October day in 1993!  GO SEE THIS MOVIE! YOU WILL BE THANKFUL YOU DID!
0394800389|5.0|Since my son was 2, he's now 3, we've been reading this.  It is one of his favorite books!  He really enjoys the tweedle beetles and Mommie gets to practice speaking clearly and pronunciating correctly.  It's almost a test for me, but so much fun!  Reading this book allows the parent to practice using tone when reading...children associate stories with the voice their parent uses while reading.  Dr. Seuss's method of rhyming really gets a child's attention.  This book has been a wonderful experience.
B00000DQWT|5.0|I have listend to this soundtrack millions of times and NEVER get tired of the tracks &quot;Chris&quot;, &quot;Daulton Lee&quot;  and &quot;This is Not America&quot; (both instrumental and vocal versions).  Pat Metheny blew me away with this soundtrack.  Without it, the movie would have been much less than what it was.  This is a must for any film score collector, or synthesizer lover.<br />David Bowie's vocal on this is my favorite song ever done by Bowie.
6301442962|5.0|The film begins with the supervisor of the parade assigning people to their posts. Isn't it always difficult with people hired for a one-day job? Then we see her daughter, raised as a sensible, rational little adult. As compensation for her failed marriage, or a symptom of the failure? Some say you should never lie to a child, like telling them about Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, or other legends. But doing so prepares them for life: they will be lied to by rulers, advertisers, employers, friends, and relatives. Get used to it, kid!<br />The story is that the real Kris Kringle shows up to play Santa Claus - which he does to perfection. He is \\"too good to be true\\". This film contrasts the legends to the realities of adult life. What would happen if everyone spoke the truth as they knew it? Is this film a warning against forcing children to grow up too soon?<br />Susan Walker tells Santa Claus what she really wants: a home with a backyard where she can play. Isn't that what every child should have? After happily married parents? One scene shows Mr. Macy shaking hands with Mr. Gimbel; is this a comment on world conflicts? Another scene discusses the \\"guilt complex\\" of giving away gifts. Does this explain the charities of Carnegie, Rockefeller, and the others?<br />The story continues with Kris Kringle brought into court for a sanity hearing. Anybody who doesn't believe in Santa Claus, or lawyers, should see this. Yes, the scenario is rigged, just like a lot of life. Or maybe some court cases? Does public opinion affect trials like in this film? Do political bosses advise judges in real life? How do you think judges get appointed? Kris Kringle's lawyer persists in his defense, even at the cost of his job. He will defend ordinary people against their oppressors. The political boss explains the economics of the Santa Claus legend, a fact that cannot be denied.<br />Since the Post Office has a ton of dead letters, they decide to send them to the courtroom. His identity isthus authenticated by the US Government! The ending is drawn out, but little Susan finally gets her Christmas present. \\"You have to have faith\\" says her mother. And another happy ending to a Hollywood movie.<br />The saddest fact is that Natalie Wood never lived long enough to play the mother in the remake. Real life doesn't always have a happy ending.

There is real talent here.

039472903X|5.0|You will be so glad you bought this book. You get tens of thousands of dollars worth of &quot;genius consulting&quot; for so little.<br />I suspect you are like me, and like most marketers, you're always looking for better ways to improve your ROI. I've read at least a dozen of the top marketing, ad writing, copywriting books out there. Scientific Advertising, Copywriting That Sells, and Ogilvy on Advertising are superior.<br />Ogilvy on Advertising is the best. Written in David Ogilvy's British sense of humour it is enjoyable. This is not a textbook. Every point of advice (and there are many) is well-founded in fact and is time-tested. The book is jam-packed with illustrations of the tips and opinions on how to write/design better ads. And even on what bad ads look/read like.<br />The only two chapters not useful to me were on Getting a Job in the industry and building an agency (these would certainly be profound for any individual pursuing either of these ends nonetheless.) Other than that, I'd stop reading my review and buy this book today. Within 30 minutes of reading Ogilvy on Advertising you'll be sketching out better ads - as I did.
B00004HYLF|5.0|ROMANTIC WARRIOR is the jazz-rock quartet's swan song, and do they ever go out with a bang!  Chick Corea and Co. kick things off with \\"Medieval Overture\\", a jaunty yet spacey number.  Lenny White stirs up some funky magic with \\"Sorceress\\".  Check out the interplay between Corea and DiMeola in this one!  \\"Romantic Warrior\\" is Chick's passionate tribute to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.  There are some excellent solos here from Clarke, DiMeola and Corea.  Next, we have the rockish \\"Majestic Dance\\" with some beautiful chord progressions.  Stanley Clarke contributes \\"The Magician\\", which has a childlike quality to it.  Handbells, alarm clocks, and slide whistles are used effectively here.  Last is the album's tour-de-force, Corea's two-part \\"Duel Of The Jester And The Tyrant\\" (which made me want this CD so badly).  Chick plays the synth so beautifully and deftly, while his fellow bandmates interplay with him beautifully.  This CD is a definite must-have for RTF fans like myself.

B00000JMQE|5.0|I wasn't born until 2 years after this film came out theatres. When it came out on video in the early ninties, my mom and I always used to watch it with me. I'll be honest, this movie always used to scare the bejesus out of me. But I thought this was a well done, no, that would be an understatement, a TERRIFIC movie. It was nice to see the return of the ruby slippers. Although, the part that scared me most was when Mombi put on that scary head that she put on when she went psycho. I always used to cover my eyes.<br />It was also nice to see Dorothy's old house in the ruins of Munchkin Land. And Dorothy's confusion as to the Munchkins whereabouts. I guess the reason why I like it is because a girl is the hero. I'm a boy, so I've always been intrigued by heroines. Especially Dorothy. This is one of the greatest movie sequals of all time. What would be even more amazing would be a triqual.
0440178002|5.0|I don't want to be one of those long winded reviewers so I'll keep it short.<br />Shogun is a beautiful read.  Very few books I've read have been as powerful.  It is definitely one of my favorite books and it competes with other classics such as Lord of the Rings (although they are not of the same genre).<br />The book is a wonderful journey and deserves to be read.
B00004Y7SF|2.0|First, let me just start off by saying that Christina Aguilera possesses a beautiful voice. Whether she knows how to use it is another matter. Some of the songs on this album are startlingly beautiful. Those being the simpler tunes. The ones she goes insane on, riffing her voice for all it's worth, are the ones that drag it down. Her voice would be SO much better suited to a simpler style. Playing tricks with your voice does not make you a good singer. Apparently no one has taught her this. So all in all...a poor album, with massive potential. Come on Christina we all know you can do better.
B000002C1V|5.0|Yes, kings (as Rush said some years ago), Floyd were the kings of their era, and this record serves as a farewell to that very much beloved era.<br />A lot has been said about Waters departure, his apparent solo-work in this record, Gilmour's anger, etc. But the most intriguing for me is the fact that this record has some tracks left-off from The Wall sessions which complete the circle plus some other ideas Roger added while writing/recording this one.<br />This is a master work on its own, but linked to The Wall, makes it even better. As you can tell, in &quot;The Final Cut&quot; song, it is &quot;Pink&quot; (the character from The Wall) who cries out loud for liberation through &quot;the final cut&quot; but is afraid of it. Beautifully painted both lyrically and musically (Waters is still one of the best lyricists around while Gilmour stands out as one of the most talented guitar players in the rock'n'roll world), the whole record keeps unity and musical flow.<br />Sax and guitar solos, the usage of piano and Roger and David's voices make it a Pink Floyd work, no matter what anybody says, a not-as-usual one, but still, with the Floyd flavour all-around.<br />One of the best records (and most misunderstood ones) amongst the whole Floyd &quot;back catalog&quot;. Please bear in mind that although excellent, most of those old recordings have their own signature (Animals is very different from Meddle or Saucerful of Secrets but great anyway), and The Final Cut is not an exception.
B00006M183|5.0|This is Pearl Jams greatest record ever, a must buy for everyone.<BR>Its like Pearl Jams White Album or Sargeant Pepper, its a really mature record, you can see how theyve improved along the years.

B00004UEE5|5.0|I love Mahler!  I have at least three recordings of every symphony and enjoy what each concuctor/director brings out of this composer's genius.  However, watching the Fifth performed by the CSO is a real treat.  I believe the brass in the CSO still sets the standard for orchestral playing.  In fact in the first few bars you will see why Adolf Herseth is heralded as THE greatest orchestral trumpeter of all time.  His playing is technically flawless and beautifully passionate.  He IS the best.  The entire orchestra is warm, rich and vibrant.  I enjoyed every aspect of this performance.  The interpretation is extremely romantic yet not overdone and the playing is tremendous.  Brass players MUST see this performance; however, woodwind and string players will love this as well.  Is there a better clarinetist than Larry Combs?  This is a fabulous performance.  Don't miss it!
0783235607|5.0|Although this landmark Hitchcock film is over 4O years old, it still manages to instill the shudders!  Many factors contribute to this fact.  The performances are first-rate, especially that of Anthony Perkins: he was forever identified with this role (is it any wonder?) and Perkins was practically type-cast as movie audiences relished savouring his playing of demented Norman Bates.  The black and white photography is another factor towards the film's perennial success.  If this had been filmed in colour, it wouldn't have nearly the intended impact.  Thirdly, there is the classic, terrificly creepy musical score by Bernard Herrmann which is, in a word, unforgettable.   Janet Leigh is natural and effective in her playing of Marion Crane: when she takes off with that $4O,OOO, the audience goes right along for the ride!  Even Hitchcock's daughter, Pat, is cleverly cast as the receptionist at the Phoenix bank, and she somehow lingers in the memory - definitely a Hitchcockian touch: we remember &quot;Teddy&quot; and &quot;aspirin&quot;.  Handsome John Gavin is a bit wooden as Sam, but then so is Vera Miles as Lila (is that a wig she's wearing?): they seem destined to be together after the fade-out. Even as a kid, I thought the bedroom of Mrs. Bates was grotesque: hearts, artificial flowers, cupids and all - and that imprint on the bed....ugh!! The scenes in the Bate's motel office are brilliantly acted in every respect: with Leigh, Gavin and Balsam respectively.  As Arbogast, Martin Balsam is memorably honest in his playing and his death scene is particularly jolting. Concerning Lila, Sam &amp; Marion's whereabouts,  I love the scene where Arbogast says to Lila &quot;...but I don't believe you&quot; - Lila replies thusly: &quot;I don't care whether YOU believe me or NOT!!&quot;  When Mrs. Bates appears to be very much alive according to Lila, John McIntire is memorable as the gruff but essentially tender-hearted sheriff.   Eerily, he questions just who is buried in her plot in the local cemetery? - which gives the film an obviously intentional &quot;false twist&quot;  Lurene Tuttle, that great veteran character actress plays the sheriff's wife who insists that Mrs. Bate's was buried in a dress of &quot;periwinkle blue&quot; (!). Most every horror fan knows that Leigh (and thousands of women) refrained form taking showers after seeing this film upon its initial release in 196O.  Janet Leigh's &quot;blood&quot; was actually Hershey's chocolate syrup going &quot;down the drain&quot;!  The Joseph Stefano script is - if not brilliant - interesting: it was adapted from the novel by Robert Bloch.  Said to be inspired from one Edward Gein, an eccentric Wisconsin bachelor who, after his domineering mother died, went &quot;psycho&quot; in his secluded isolation. Creepy.
0385508417|1.0|What started as a lighthearted and thought provoking account of the commercialism of the Christmas season, ended with a too tidy wrapping addressed to &quot;Hollywood - make me an offer.&quot;  Grisham's sudden entry of the Peruvian boyfriend and the concerns of the Kranks is simply too strange and distracting for this holiday plot, no matter how supposedly sarcastic its intent. Skip this waste of talent.
B00005AFVR|4.0|The amazing stuff here is that there´s not even one bad moment in this entire double CD! What you got here is exactly the same as the DVD (but with a few less songs). If you know the DVD&lt; you know that this CD is a must to have.<br />The energy in this show (actually, the best of two shows realized in Madison Squared Garden in 2000) is unbeliavable! THIS IS A ROCK AND ROLL BAND!
B00006ADFL|5.0|This is a deeply moving, amazing, and disturbing real story of a horrific murder perpetrated by two teenage girls in New Zealand... and it's no wonder that after making it, Peter Jackson was noticed and given a shot at \\"Lord of the Rings\\". It's worth seeing regardless of whether you're interested in LotR. While watching it, though, remember that real life wrote an even more shocking \\"sequel\\" to the story: instead of sitting in a prison cell, one of the teenage murderers, Juliet Hulme, is now a bestselling millionaire author of (of all things) murder-mystery novels, writing under the name of \\"Anne Perry\\".
B000069HKH|4.0|The Boss and The E-Street BAND: the chemistry is unbeliavable.<br />THE RISING is a return to form, a grandious one.

B00005JKCH|1.0|It is simply amazing to me that this film has been as successful as it has.  It is entirely unoriginal and very derivative of two previous &quot;super-hero&quot; films, namely &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Batman,&quot; and is not nearly as convincing.  The script is poorly written with ham-fisted dialogue and Tobey Maguire's flippant portrayal of Spider-Man is irritating. Basically this is a Hollywood rehash cloaked behind hype and special effects.

B00006YXEK|5.0|In an era when mediocre actresses who are even more mediocre singers are musical superstars, this final work from George Harrison is indeed a welcome sight. This intriguing disc, to my ears, is a musical hybrid of George's massive All Things Must Past and his unassuming, self-titled 1979 album. George's appealing mixture of sarcasm & sincerity, not to mention an incredibly astute musical acumen, makes Brainwashed a most rewarding experience.<br />Many of the tunes seem to have forbears in George's catalogue; a revisiting of favorite Harrison themes. That is not to imply that any of these exquisite songs are mere retreads, they are refinements. \\"Any Road\\" is as wonderfully melodic as any Beatles tune, and the ukulele is delightful. The message of reincarnation (at least to my ears) reminds me of \\"Heading For The Light.\\" \\"P2 Vatican Blues\\" is as sardonic as \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" with some great guitar work & an especially strong Harrison vocal. The confessional \\"Pisces Fish\\" is lovely & reminiscent of \\"Fish In The Sand.\\"<br />\\"Looking For My Life\\" is an absolutely gorgeous song; amazingly, it's still not as good as \\"Rising Sun\\"! This must rank as one of George's greatest compositions, as well as one of his greatest guitar solos. It just stays in your consciousness! \\"Marwa Blues\\" has some atmospheric guitar work and very dreamy quality. \\"Stuck Inside A Cloud\\" has the typical Harrison touch with silky guitar work and a hooky melody.<br />\\"Run So Far\\" has that Indian sound that graces so much of George's work. George's voice is again in great shape. \\"Never Get Over You\\" is so incredibly moving that it's almost difficult to take on the first listen. George obviously loved his wife; from what I've read about her, it's easy to see why.<br />\\"Between The Devil & The Deep Blue See\\" is in the Harrison tradition of taking cover tunes (Got My Mind..., True Love, Hong Kong Blues) & making them entirely his own. \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii\\" reminds me of \\"Soft Touch Baby\\": a very warm, charming song that invites images of Polynesian beaches.<br />\\"Brainwashed\\" has depressingly accurate sentiments about the states of materialism & conformity (two modes of behavior that Harrison rightly criticized his entire life) that seem to engulf this planet. Musically, it's the child of \\"Living In The Material World\\" and the Ravi Shankar Chants of India album. George's sincere spiritual beliefs shine; personally, I don't profess any religious beliefs, but such is George's passion, it makes me WANT to believe.<br />The extras that come in the cool Dark Horse box are pretty nifty. The guitar pick was a wonderful idea. Jeff Lynne's production is suitably more restrained than in times past & Dhani Harrison will be a musician to watch in the near future. Incidentally, when are we going to see the rest of George Harrison's back catalogue re-mastered?ry warm, charming song that invites images of Polynesian beaches. <br />\\"Brainwashed\\" has depressingly accurate sentiments about the states of materialism & conformity (two modes of behavior that Harrison rightly criticized his entire life) that seem to engulf this planet.

B00007E8V4|5.0|When i first heard that System of a Down was coming out with a new cd of unreleased songs from the Toxocity sessions, i was worried that the cd would not be very good.  These songs were rejects, but when i heard this cd it gave me a better appreciation of the Toxicity album.  These new songs are every bit as good as the ones off of Toxicity or their self titled cd.  This cd has has a wide variety of sounds form the thrash on boom! to the acoustic Roulette.  This cd has the songs with the catchy chorus like aerials in I-E-A-I-A-I-O and has wonderful lyrics in Chic N' Stew and Mr. Jack.  This cd does not sound like a cd full of rejects.  If you are a System of a Down fan, then this cd is a must have.  If you do not like their first two albums, then you probably will not like this one either.  I think that it is a must have cd, but that is only my opinion.
B000075BFK|4.0|I am biased just like everyone else, consequently my opinion will probably not parallel yours, so I will keep this brief.    This is definetly one of his worst albums, but it is still superior to 99% of the other [weak ones] out there, hence the 4 stars.  Recycled lyrics, abrupt mood shifts, an appearance by Nas and some very un-Pac beats combine to produce a contradictory album that wanders aimlessly.  Most of the lyrics and some of the songs (ie. Late Night, Who Do You Believe In) I have heard before on the illegitimate underground compilations such as Thug Passion etc.  It felt wierd to plunk down twenty bucks for this, knowing that a portion of my hard-earned cash was going straight to Suge's next pair of Gucci boots and also that I could easily just download the whole album for free.  Nevertheless, the trooper in me shelled out the money (I think its a Gemini thing).  So far, I like the following tracks, in no particular order : Changed Man, Mama's Just a Little Girl, Fair Xchange, My Block remix, Thugz Mansion and Better Dayz.  The new lyrics are good, and, together with Better Dayz, the My Block remix, an appearance by Mr. Biggs, two good photos in the booklet, and, quite frankly, the fact that it is a genuine Pac album makes it a good buy.  ... overall, this one is for the fans, and Pac would not be proud of this if he was still alive. <br />P.S. If you're new to Pac, may I suggest the albums : 7 Day Theory, All Eyez on Me and Me Against the World and the tracks : Str8 Ballin, So Many Tears, Ambitionz az a Ridah, Until the End of Time, Fright Night, Happy Home (underground version), Krazy, Hold Your Head, Life of an Outlaw and pretty much every track on Disc Two of All Eyez on Me.<br />P.P.S. There is a short secret track on Disc Two of Better Dayz.<br />P.P.P.S Read Machiavelli's \\"The Prince\\" and the \\"Tibetan Book of the Dead\\" to evolve your understanding of Pac's lyrics.<br />P.P.P.P.S 'Tupac Amaru' was the name of an Indian in South America who rebelled against the annexing Spaniards.  The name means 'shining serpent' in Arabic.  He was decapitated while his tribe looked on....
0446310786|5.0|This book is absolutely brilliant.  I've read the book three times in my life, at ages 13, 18, and 22.  With each reading I gain a better appreciation for the storyline, the author, and the moral beliefs that are challenged within these pages.  There are few books that increase in complexity the more they are read, and this happens to be one of them.  Harper Lee seems to speak to readers of all ages, and no matter how many times this novel is read, the reader will never cease to feel compelled by the message that it delivers.<br />The story is narrated by Scout, the daughter of Atticus Finch, a criminal defense attorney in the Deep South who is assigned to defend a black man in his trial for raping a white girl.  The novel tells the story of how Scout and her family endure the threatening ridicule from their community for Atticus' loyalty to this man.  While Harper Lee delivers the message that black people were discriminated against in the Deep South, the more notable message was the struggle that whites endured when they chose to side with the blacks.  There are some extremely comical moments in this book involving Scout and her brother.  Therre are also several other interesting sub-plots that help describe the morals, beliefs, and problems in the Deep South during that period of time.  Though, my favorite part was Atticus Finch's closing argument during the trial.  His monologue constitutes some of the best pages of literature I've ever read.<br />This was the only novel that Harper Lee ever wrote.  Maybe it is best that she never published again.  There's no way that she could have ever topped this novel.  Not many authors can.  This novel will always remain a permanent member of my book collection, and I'm sure I'll be reading it a few more times in my life and gaining something new ever time.  Everyone should read this book.
B000069HK2|5.0|I'm not going to write a song by dong review, but i will point out some songs that stand out in my mind. &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot; is definently the best song on the CD, mostly because it has great lyrics and there isn't too much screaming. &quot;A box full of sharp objects&quot; is another good song because even though it does have the screaming, it still works. There are a couple of songs that i think they use a little too much screaming, but if you listen to the lyrics, it makes the song well worth it. All and all, The Used has put out a 5 star CD, complete with all the emo requirments; screaming, mumbling, and GREAT lyrics
B00005OAIE|4.0|Personally I think the album [is great] but if your not into blaz don't be suprised.  It's like a new groove coming out on the edge of jazz and blues.  Young adults getting sick of all the hate rock rap and rangle just needing a little smooth groove.  The antithesis to antithesis is no oppinion at all.  A player in for the playing and only the playing and not haveing too much of a rant about anything except life and how ... good it is to be alive even with the little aches and pains.  Maybe a touch cynical but that is the hand we're dealt.  Hey this guy kicks the building down with The Razors Edge. 4 stars only because it ain't for everyone five stars because I love it. ...
B00005JL0I|3.0|The psychedelic technicolor on this DVD was worth waiting for. It's worth keeping for the pictures alone, but then there's the fabulous music (including the immortal Audiophile wet dream \\"Look of Love\\" sung by Dusty Springfield playing while Ursula Andress seduces Peter Sellers, and also the equally immortal Tijuana Brass and Burt Bacharach), and the incredible star actors who do a fine job under the circumstances, especially Niven, Sellers, Allen, and Andress. There isn't much of a plot, almost zero continuity, loose ends galore, and total chaos in parts, but in the end the goodness of the parts makes the whole worthwhile. It's a miracle, maybe, but it works. Oh, and I need to mention the sexy girls, the macho guys, the incredible costumes, the gags, the props, ad infinitum. Apparently part of it was filmed below the Playboy club in London from which they got lots of extras.<br />While worth keeping, this is obviously not a \\"great\\" movie in any sense, so I'm surprised at all the 5 star ratings. Fortunately they tend to balance off the unfair 1 star ratings. I enjoyed this more than both \\"Austin Powers International Man of Mystery\\" (which kept me wincing) and \\"Our Man Flint\\" (which seemed rather short, hollow, and cheap...low budget obviously...). I'd actually give Casino Royale 3.5 stars if I could. It's easily better than the other spoofs, and ALMOST a great movie in its own right. When you understand what the producer was doing, and how the film was made, that's a miracle.<br />If you want to see the \\"real\\" Casino Royale plot, the TV version from the 1950's is included, unfortunately cut a few minutes short I've read here.<br />The documentary by the director who ultimately got the unenviable job of glueing this all together (Val Guest) was instructive. It's a miracle this movie was ever finished. The producer (an ex-agent) simply hired a number of top directors and ordered them each to do their thing. There was no \\"book\\" (the actual book was to be ignored sincealmost all the material in it had previously been used in \\"serious\\" Bond films). To make it worse, Orson Wells refused to do any significant amount of acting with Peter Sellers (who he considered an \\"Amateur\\"), so their scenes had to be spliced together. Though Val doesn't explain this, that might have led to Seller's sick-out, when then led to having Sellers fired, so they had to figure out how to complete the movie without Sellers. That's really a pity, because Sellers is actually an outstanding actor and does outstanding work here (much better than Wells, in fact). He's only topped by Niven. (And despite what Wells seemed to think of himself, I consider even Casino Royale better than any of his \\"serious\\" movies...Orson Wells is the most overrated actor and director in history IMHO, but he does a adequate job here as a bit part actor.)
B00007E8V4|5.0|If your like me you heard Toxicity and thought holy crap, that was amazing, but so different from there first cd.  Where can they go from here.  What could serj do w/ his voice? All your questions are answered in this amazing cd.  Id heard all the songs while looking to get toxicity from the internet, so there was no real surprise, but if you like Serj's voice, and youve always thought they;re lyrics could be funnier, you will LOVE this cd.  It does have itss erious songs, but overall its a trule amazing cd from 4 truly amazing artists who just wanted to give there music to the world.
0425152251|5.0|This was possibly one of the greatest novels i have ever read. From start to finish i was enthralled by the details and references to philosophers. I found Socrate's section most interesting. Upon completing this book I found myself inspired to learn more about philosophy and have since studied greatly other various methods of thought. I strongly recommend this book to even those who have no interest in philosophy whatsoever, because at the start of this book I did not.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The self-titled Audioslave album is not another 'Limp Bizkit' record, it is a powerhouse of emotion, talent, good solid rock music. Their first single, Cochise was only a glimpse of what this band is capable of. Tom Morello proves that even with out Rage Against the Machine, he is one of the most accomplished guitarists of our day. Brad Wilk and Tim Commerford bring some amazing rythm to the music with their unique playing, and Chris Cornell is sure to blow your mind yet again, with his powerful lyrics and heavenly voice. They could be the band that saves rock, and with bands out like Papa Roach and Blink 182, thats something we REALLY need.
B00006GFAB|2.0|If you're a die hard Kiss fan, you probably already have all these songs, so don't bother with the CD. If you're not, don't bother with this CD. It's full of rather unimaginative, derivative 70's rock, absent the spectacle of their stage performances. If you like Kiss & don't have many of their CDs, then get this one ... it'll do until you can afford the others.<br />Personally, I'd go for concert footage in surround sound, or even music videos. This CD experience was flat, a disappointment. Perhaps I've just grown up too much since the 70's and need to trip back to my youth. Even so, for this genre, I'd prefer Def Leppard--more verve, more creativity, more driving power. More interesting.<br />But choose your own poison ... how you want to blow your hearing is none of my business. This CD just doesn't rate high enough for me to risk tinnitus for it!

B00005N91B|4.0|I wasn't very impressed by Basic Instinct the first time I saw it, but having recently gained a new appreciation for Verhoeven's work, I decided to give it another look. I wasn't disappointed; this is a terrifically goofy, fun piece of work, that serves as marvelous entertainment if you don't take it too seriously. Sharon Stone is solid (in the one of the few roles I've seen her do where she actually acted), and Michael Douglas is surprisingly good, playing a nastier variation on all of his \\"middle-aged-white-male-who-sleeps-with-younger-women\\" roles. There's subtext here, if you want it, but you don't have to look for it to enjoy the movie.<br />Verdict: It outdoes Brian Depalma, which is saying something.
B000059HCN|5.0|Requiem For A Dream is just one of those movies. It is one of those movies that sticks with you for days, weeks, months, and years after you watch it. As you watch it, you become hypnotized and can't think of anything but this blur of images pounding on your brain, one image after another. It is an experience like no other.<BR>   <BR>   Requiem For A Dream, based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr.,  is the story of 4 people; A woman, her son, his girlfriend, and his best friend. This woman, Sarah Goldfarb, played amazingly by Ellen Burstyn, is the lonely, T.V. addicted mother of Harry Goldfarb, played by Jared Leto, a drug addict who wants to make it big in the dealing business, Tyrone C. Love, played surprisingly well by Marlon Wayans, his best friend and partner in crime who misses his dear mother, and Harry's girlfriend Marion Silver,  played well, as usual, by Jennifer Connolly, a severely depressed artist who plans on starting her own business. <br />   During the summer, everything was perfect; Harry and Tyrone were making hard cash, Marion had ideas for her store, and Sarah had a place in the sun outside with the other old ladies of the apartment building. Life was sublime. Total bliss. Then Sarah recieves a phone call from her favorite game show, which says that she is going to become a contestant. She is very excited, not knowing that she will never ACTUALLY be on the show. She decides she is going to wear her favorite red dress but cannot fit into it. After several diets, she decides to try diet pills.<br />   Then comes the winter. Harry and Tyrone's business is failing due to a shortage of drugs and money to buy drugs. The money gradually disappears, and everything falls apart. Now Harry, Tyrone, and Sarah are all hopelessly addicted and dependent on drugs. Marion is performing sexual favors for people in order to make money for Harry's business. All this leads up to a disturbing and shocking conclusion. This movie is truly a masterpiece.<br />  This movieis the one thing that really convinced me, never in my life, to do drugs. Not some cartoon they might show you in health class, or one of those pointless \\"this is your brain on drugs\\" commercials. A remarkable film. Truly remarkable.<br />Requiem For A Dream (Unrated Version)<BR>Released in 2000<BR>Starring Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connolly, and Marlon Wayans<BR>Rated R for intense depiction of drug addiction, graphic sexuality, strong language and some violence. <BR>Originally rated NC-17, uncut version is UNRATED.
0812550706|5.0|I'm sure when it happened. Maybe it started as far back as when Jules Verne and H.G. Wells first began reflecting our society through the mirror of alien worlds, but at some point in the last century a surprising trend became evident: The most brilliant minds in the literary universe were writing science fiction. No book emphasizes this point more then Orson Scott Card's &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, one of the most chokingly powerful books I have ever read (and as a librarian, I've read quite a few).<br />&quot;Ender&quot; is comparatively underread, though, because its story of one boy's redemption in the face of unspeakable crimes is disguised as a rollicking space-story. So if you are one of those people who as a rule stick to just one genre (or as a buddy of mine told me the other day: &quot;I'll read anything but science fiction&quot;) please, PLEASE don't let that stop you from reading this incredible book. And if you do give it a chance, please don't read anything further about the plot; the full impact of Scott's genius is best felt with no prior preperation (that's why I haven't given a plot summerary). When he finally pulls all the threads of the story together, you'll feel like you've just slammed into a brick wall.<br />This is a novel that stays with you forever, warning you of the ease of losing your soul , and filling you with hope if you're looking to regain it.<br />Absolutely not to be missed.
6304806426|5.0|The English Patient is one of the few films where you can find excellence in every aspect.The film is superbly made:acting,cinematography,art direction,musical score,costume,editing,direction;all of these pieces were crafted by the best in their fields.I believe attention was given to every detail by the director A. Minghella.<BR>The acting by the three principals:Fiennes,Scott-Thomas and Binoche is so good that you forget that they are actors and you only see their characters. I have to disagree with some reviewers, in that in my opinion the best acting in the film belongs to Kristin Scott-Thomas.Her portrayal of Katherine is complex,true to the personality of her character. I remenber Janet Maslin's review in the New York Times in which she said that the film set up sparks with the grand entrance of Scott-Thomas(Katherine).<BR>This a film that deserves viewing;deserved all the nine Oscars it won and the few ones it did not win.

B000075BFK|5.0|Another double album from Tupac 6 years after his death Hmmm. Is he alive? Is he dead? I think all of these issues should be cast aside and people should concentrate on the music.<BR> <BR>This album shows Pac to still be one of the best MCs in history. As always he demonstrates his diverse talent rhyming softly on melodic tracks like \\"Fame\\" to spitting bullets at his once friend Notorious BIG and the Bad Boy Family. Beefs that have thankfully been left in the past.<br />The Oulawz make another great appearance on this album, a group who are truly underrated. Every track that they feature on with Pac they manage to compliment his venomous style. If you enjoy it I recommend 2Pac + Outlawz - Still I Rise.<br />One track that truly needs a mention on this album is \\"Thugz Mansion\\" with NAS. Here Pac and NAS show that good MCs don't need big beats to rhyme on with this mind blowing acoustic track which demands to be listened to again and again. I hope Interscope decide to release this on single because truly mad. <br />Overall another excellent album go and buy it!!!!
B000075BFK|4.0|May be most of the listeners think that 2pac is dead but i am sure he is not,any way about this album it is great but it is not like untill the end of time,i think in this album 2pac have changed his style by songs like Never call u bich again and fame and others,anyway enjoy it .
B00006CXXU|4.0|Just as Christina says in her opener, \\"Here it is, no gloss, no pretense, just me...stripped.\\" No, not naked. And yes, that's exactly what the cover leads you to believe. So do the liner notes. Yes, I would think that Christina would have done a little better, ... Well, nonetheless, I did purchase the CD. I have always appreciated Christina's voice, and I was hoping that maybe she was starting to use that great voice correctly. It was showcased in Lady Marmalade, so I decided to check this CD out. The CD opens with the 'Stripped' Intro. My first sentence in this review pretty much sums it up. Then you move into her R&B duo with Lil' Kim 'Can't Hold Us Down'. My first thought: she's still her little white trash self. My thought afterwards: Christina did a pretty good job with that song. Pretty impressive. I moved to Walk Away, which is one of the highlights of this CD. That track leads right into 'Fighter', which is also another highlight. Linda Perry, writing for Pink? This to me has an angrier 'Just Like A Pill' feel to it. And it's also, to me, Christina's better answer to Britney's 'Stronger'. I hope that this will be Christina's third choice for a single. Then we have some Spanish crap that I really can't stand. Loving Me For Me is a very nice song, but to me it's just a filler. Alicia Keys then takes over, accompaning Aguilera during 'Impossible'. Very motown, very Alicia Keys, very 'How Come You Don't Call Me', but no Alicia screeching. Great vocals from Christina. 'Underappreciated' is some 70's disco mess I always skip over. 'Beautiful' is such a wonderful song - I'm very glad to know this is Christina's next single choice (much better than her nasty, trashy, mature 'Dirrty') I'm not big on 'Make Over', but I really do enjoy 'Cruz'. It's just a let go song, and it shows how real and normal that Christina can get. No vocal gymnastics getting in the way, just plain stuff. 'Soar' is a very great song, with a very nice gospel choir in the background. 'Get Mine,Get Yours' and 'Dirrty', I can't stand... 'Stripped' Part 2 is basically the same as the Intro, just shorter. 'A Voice Within' is decent, but just a filler song again. My personal favorite is 'I'm OK'. This is such a personal and deep song from Christina....  Absolutely wonderful, and very chilling lyrics and music! 'Singing My Song' is a very long, but very inspiring track. It's a gospel, conclusion track to 'Soar' and 'Beautiful', to me. So, above all, the point of this review is to prove that Christina has moved away from her teeny-bopper self (Thank God) and gotten into some more mature things. Some of them a little too mature, but still. This album, to me, shows a great mark of improvement, and reassures me that we'll be able to hear more out of this great woman in the future.

The plot itself isnt your usual Hollywood fare: guy discovers a portal that leads to straight to the inside of John Malkovich. Puppeteer guys girlfriend uses to portal to initiate a transexual affair with puppeteer guys female colleague - using John Malkovichs body. A stunningly assured piece of work from video director Spike Jonez who toys with just about every conception of modern cinema there is. Cameron Diaz shows what a talented comedy actress she is, John Cusack carries off the male lead with distinction, John Malkovich is sporting as himself, but for me the films real star is Catherine Keener who smoulders with provocative sexuality and femme fatale appeal. Jones has very light touch, and although Being John Malkovich is a highly unorthodox film, you cant help but get [pulled] into the movie, which at times adopts a sort of Dogma-real-life- shaky-Handicam approach for a documentary-like authnticity. I dont generally buy a lot of movies but this is one to keep and watch on a regular basis. Great gift, in fact.
B000075BFK|5.0|this cd is off da hook..some things are questionable like the acoustic of thugz mansion with nas, but the song is mad. every song is good on the cd..it is a must buy for regulars and new commers...
B00003CY6M|5.0|MY GIRLFRIEND AND I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF THIS MOVIE.  ALTHOUGH THE PLOT IS PREDICTABLE, THE STORY AND THE MUSIC MAKE YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH THE MAIN CHARACTERS AND THE IDEA OF THEM FINDING EACH OTHER.  IT ALSO SHOWS HOW PEOPLE CAN ACT WHEN DRIVEN BY LOVE, WHICH IS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT RIDICULOUS.  <BR>JOHN CUSACK PLAYS A GREAT MAN UNDER STRESS AND KATE BECKINSALE IS JUST THE SWEET GIRL EVERY MAN WOULD LIKE TO HAVE.  A GREAT MOVIE, HOWEVER I DO NOT RECCOMEND THE MOVIE FOR A BACHELOR AND HIS BUDDIES.
B000001GLK|5.0|In one word - breathtaking.  Simply the best version of the Beethoven piano concertos ever recorded. Gorgeous orchestra sound and phenomenal pianism.  Pollini is wonderful.  Do not miss it!
6303114946|5.0|Some friends of mine and I discovered this movie one day on cable, and it has become one of my all-time favorites. The acting by all participants is incredible. The conflict between father and son that arises is poignant. Josh, just wanting to be a kid and play a game, is played incredibly well by this young actor. You don't even have to like chess to enjoy this movie, but that's because this movie isn't really even about chess. Its about being a kid. All the more amazing because this movie is based on a real person.

B00006RU5B|5.0|With almost 3 years having passed since the last Rage Against The Machine Album being released, Audioslave has taken the throne and have come to kick royal ....  With Chris Cornell taking the place of Zack de la Rocha, the voice of grunge mixes with the speaker exploding guitar licks of Tom Morello to become the most anticipated release of the year.  If you don't own this album, what are you waiting for? Stop depriving yourself and get it immediately!
B00005OCMR|1.0|I caught a glimpse of this re-issue. Well, if you really liked the original movie you'll love this, but the movie itself was about as briliiant as Disneys \\"Black Hole\\".<br />It's a laughable attempt to capitalize on the 80's video game craze, and is just about as good as the 70's cb craze movies (breaker breaker good buddy!).<br />To each his own - the DVD is pretty, but it's about as bad as \\"sci-fi\\" can get. It's a just plain stupid plot. ...
B00006AG5N|5.0|After years of exposure to tasteless tabloid stories, hideous impersonators and slanderous accusations of racism and cultural theft, finally the focus is switching back to what's really important - Elvis' music and that incredible soulful voice. <br />The sound on this cd, as others have mentioned, is miles ahead of previous Elvis greatest hits releases, especially the 50's mono tracks. It is a great introduction to Elvis, but like any &quot;hits&quot; collection, leaves out many many great tracks that display his incredible versatility and the diversity of his musical tastes - gospel, country, blues, ballads and soul/funk. <br />Where to go from here? Well the array of different Elvis titles can be confusing and a little overwhelming. If you can't afford the box sets, sort the wheat from the chaff with this little gem: the book &quot;The Rough Guide to Elvis&quot; - You won't regret it!!
B000001EKX|4.0|Hotter than Hell is the 2nd KISS album and the production is much different from their debut. Dark and sludgy, you can literally hear and feel the cold winter they spent in New York creating these songs. Got to Choose is much slower and Sabbath-y<BR>than the live version. There really isn't a poor cut on the album. Mainline and Comin' home are two classics, as is Goin' Blind. Ace once said that KISS practised in an unheated loft in NYC and used egg crates for insulation. Hotter Than Hell provides a glimpse into Kiss's world before they were millionaires- a world of complete indifference to what they were trying to do. Only the 4 of them and a few others believed.<BR>Fortunately, times were to change.<BR>I love this album for the FEEL. Next to Destroyer, their best.
B000002505|5.0|I don't know why every person who has written a review for this CD is launching into a whole paragraph of rhetoric and using profound sentences to describe it. Dudes this is not a 'literary' contest. Anyways, this is an amazing piece of music. Superb engineering (Taking into acount that the cd was produced in the 70's)...especially the experimentation with the cross fades during the guitar riffs in one of the songs. The music is overflowing with emotion. I havent heard such powerful gutar work ever in my life. I don't know why this album did not become so famous? I had been wanting to listen to it for nearly 4 years and I finally did. Well in simple words, it blew my mind. It has kept me awake for 2 days. Needless to say I am only 19 years old but I know enough about music to know what I am talking about. <BR>I hope all of you out there who are reading this review will buy this cd, as it comprises of priceless compositions. \\"This life is divine\\"...enjoy it while it lasts.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave is the first modern super group to combine the sounds of great 70's band like led zepplin and pink floyd while keeping the same funky funk of rage against the machine. this cd is a must for all alternative music fans and mainstream rock fans alike
B000075BFK|5.0|what more could i say?it's a huge album!!!! buy it!!
B000002MY3|5.0|When this album was released it caused a sensation and ultimately it is not difficult to see why. Alanis takes angst to new levels as she voices her anger, frustration and general disillusionment with the world. What is startling though is how universal such an intensely personal album has become. The youth of the 90's seem to be able to empathize greatly with Alanis' feelings and have used these songs to voice out their own dissatisfaction against society - be it against ex-boyfriends, parents or just the world itself.<br />This album is raw and powerful. Alanis does not, by far, posses one of the better voices among female solo artists today, but her voice has an edge to it which uniquely suits her material. Indeed, in some tracks there is minimal accompaniment for the raw angry vocals seeming to paint a One person raging against the world type of picture. <br />Ultimately, you can say that this album is far from ground breaking or original - but there was never its intention in the first place. It was meant as a personal expression - of anger, disgust and frustration. What it did become, however was the voice of thousands of similarly angst-ridden teens as well.

B0000026TD|5.0|A lion's roar sets the tone for this continuation of Andreas Vollenweider's ever-evolving creative vision.  This music for electroacoustic pedal harp, cheng, synthesizer, solo voice, chorus, percussion and a variety of other instruments is so unique and multi-textured that it tends to defy description.  If pressed, I'd term the offerings on this album a fusion of the best of jazz and New Age elements with flavorings from Africa, the Orient, and somewhere far off-planet.  Energizing and calming, ethereal and grounding, tantalizing and satisfying, it is an unexpected blending of extremes into a truly artful soundscape that transports you to a world free of woes and full of magic.  Beginning with \\"The Trilogy\\" and \\"Down to the Moon\\", Vollenweider continues his musical journeys here, and then enhances his signature sound in ever new and intriguing ways in \\"Eolian Minstrel\\", \\"Book of Roses\\", \\"Kryptos\\" and \\"Cosmopoly\\".
B0000024RQ|5.0|After Dylan's 1962 effort, there was talk of Columbia dropping Dylan, but thanks to some clever maneuvering from John Hammond, Dylan got his chance to show what six months away from then girlfriend Suze Rotolo could do to one's creative spirit.  <BR>Dylan was never more focused than on this album, recording an incredible cannon of work, most of which has still not seen the light of day.  Given the exhaustive amount of work to choose from, it's not surprising to find a well-rounded album that leaves no room for filler.  It's a genuine LP at a time when singles were the norm, and albums were usually ways for the &quot;unhip&quot; to catch up to date with past singles.  <BR>Suffering from the six month absence of his girlfriend, Suze Rotolo, who focused Dylan's Guthrie-esque love for the &quot;underdog&quot; into a compassion for the civil rights movement, is very much at the center of this album.  (Not to mention the cover, where she appears with Dylan)<BR>Already under criticism from some of the Greenwich Village folkies for going &quot;commercial&quot;, Dylan reworked his album to include more overtly political songs like Masters of War and Talkin' World War III Blues.  <BR>But the genius of this album was it's ability to remain innocent and subliminal, despite the obvious implications and finger pointing intended.  Dylan absorbs all his influences and refines them into an authentic voice of experience and truth, despite being 22 at the time.  <BR>Freewheelin' transcends the limitations of time and place, propelling Dylan light years beyond even his hero, Woody Guthrie by divorcing himself from becoming one voice.  <BR>From the beautiful melodic bliss of Don't Think Twice, It's Alright to Bob's remembrance of his first love in Girl From the North Country; there is an obvious humanistic element of love and innocence rarely found in the folk singer of the times.  <BR>The records benefits a great deal from John Hammond's deliberate attempt to under produce the album.Most songs were recorded after 2 or 3 takes, and so being, capture the real essence of Dylan's music and message through the rawness of his undisciplined guitar playing.  <BR>Blowin' In The Wind, A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall, Oxford Town, and Masters of War all became classics of their time.  Profound insights into the state of mind of the time, when Nuclear War seemed almost inevitable.  <BR>This record is recommended for people of all tastes and backgrounds.  It's one of a few that truly transcends all genres and constraints of time without feeling contrived.<BR>Dylan was never more focused, and never more enthusiastic and full of hope as he was on this album.  A genuine masterpiece that tells not only the story of rock 'n' roll, but of America itself.
B000001ES4|5.0|This is music celebrating the human heart and spirit in all their many moods.  With a good mix of lively songs and sweet, slow ones, this CD can make you dance one minute and cry the next.  The music was composed by Norwegian Rolf Lovland, and is orchestral in nature, featuring Irish  violinist Fionnuala Sherry, Lovland on piano, piper and whistler Davy Spillane, oboist Simon Emes, hardanger fiddler Annbjorg Lien and others.  Lovland takes his inspiration from a variety of sources--Celtic, Scandinavian, Baroque, classical and his own modern sensibilities, as well as the talents of Sherry and the other musicians.  The grace and simplicity of his arrangements and the heartfelt emotion with which they are played make this music very memorable, and very special.  When you listen to it, even on the worst of days, it's nigh impossible to look about and not see beauty all around you.  This release is my favorite of Secret Garden's albums, and I recommend it most highly!
B000002KDO|5.0|Master of Reality is known as one of the most<BR>popular albums,next to Paranoid.All the songs<BR>on here are awesome.Sweat leaf which is the most <BR>popular song,After forever,Embryo,Children of<BR>the grave which is another fan favorite,Lord<BR>of this world,Orchid,Solitude and Into the void.<BR>It is also one of their heaviest albums and it<BR>is a major influence on alot of musicians,<BR>including me.For every Ozzy/Sabbath fan I <BR>highly and strongly reccomend for you to own<BR>this album,a must have for every die hard metal fan.
B0000025QC|5.0|For me, this release and the other early work of Andreas Vollenweider defined New Age music.  Artful, complex, imaginative and ever-changing, \\"Caverna Magica\\" is the second in a trio of complimentary recordings that bring to life the magic and mystery of our world through the eyes of an artist of rare depth and clarity.  The first and third parts of the Trilogy are \\"...Behind the Gardens--Behind the Wall--Under the Tree...\\" and \\"White Winds\\", respectively.  All feature Vollenweider's signature sound of dreamy, jazzy electroacoustic pedal harp and cheng, accompanied by voice, synthesizer, a wide range of gentle percussion, \\"UFO\\" (unidentified finedrawn overcast) and occasional contributions from other instruments.  This is true music at its finest--playful, intricate compositions that are soulfully performed and ingeniously constructed, flowing one into another through an ever evolving succession of moods.  Vollenweider has this to say about his art: \\"The making of music, dancing, painting--creativity--all of this has so much to do with the ongoing process of `finding oneself', or better, of searching for the things that give us such an individual, complex, and miraculous depth of emotions...ideas...dreams...\\"  He calls his endeavors \\"wonderful adventures\\" and \\"seeker's journeys\\", and relishes \\"making this music and bringing it to its listening friends.\\"  And indeed, Vollenweider and his fellow musicians have found riches within and many friends without.  In an era where the dumbing down of the New Age genre has resulted in a plethora of mindless dronings of ambient whitenoise, this album stands as a reminder of what meditative electroacoustic music can truly be.   If you like this release, try its two companion works as well, either separately, or as packaged together in the two CD set \\"The Trilogy\\".  To follow Vollenweider's continuing evolution as an artist, try the next albums he recorded: \\"Down from the Moon\\" and \\"Dancing with the Lion\\".
0743464117|2.0|I found the HBO series rivetting...so I rushed out and bought the book.  Speilberg and Hanks tell a much better story than Ambrose, even if they glossed over the truth a bit.  In the series, the soldiers do come off as real heros.  In the book, they just seem like whiners.  I was surprised at how much Captain Winters goes on and on in the book badmouthing officers both above and below him in rank.  In his opinion only Captain Spears and himself seem to be worthy of any credit for the 101st's achievments.  It get's tiring hearing soldiers go on at length about the greatness of their company.  The producers of the series were right to minimze this...it just seems tachy to be still complaining about other soldiers 50 years later.<br />The letters of a private Webster are quoted at length, simply copied page after page into the book, so much so that his name should have be under Ambrose's on the cover.
B000077VPU|4.0|ABOUT THE FREDDIE MERCURY TRIBUTE CONCERT.<br />Ok... Let me start by saying that I watched this concert a couple of weeks after it's original broadcast day, and to this day I still think of how great it was. At that time in 1992, I lived in Colombia and I was in middle school, and after the show was on TV everybody in school was saying that they were blown away by this concert.<BR>I can honestly say that the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert was the biggest musical event of the 90s (and perhaps -and to my own judgement-, the greatest concert in music history). Besides, where else were you able to find artists like Metallica, Roger Daltrey (The Who), Def Leppard, George Michael, David Bowie, Guns N' Roses, Robert Plant(Led Zeppelin), Elton John, and of course Queen. All in one bill!!<BR>The greatness of this show is not based on the just the \\"name\\" of the performers, but because all of these artists gave the best of themselves to give their own send off to Freddie by stepping on his shoes, performing to his crowd, and singing his songs. Although some of them came close, none of them were able to equalize Freddie as a performer and a singer.<BR>As a Queen fan this concert gives you a lot of mixed emotions of sadness and joy. There are moments where you want to cry and others where you want to jump out of your seat and sing your heart out. No other concert like this would make you feel more like wishing you were on this crowd of 72.000 people at Wembley stadium.<br />About the DVD:<BR>I'm giving this DVD 4 stars for not including the first part of the show. Metallica, Def Leppard, and Guns N' Roses gave <BR>KICK-ASS performances, while Extreme gave an excellent Queen Medley which was the perfect \\"appetizer\\" of this great show.<BR>However this DVD includes the rehearsals of the songs on the second part of the show. It also includes a very poignant documentary about the show itself with commentaries from the performers and the members of Queen about how this show was organized. <BR>It also shows some of the video clips that played on the giant screens during the show while the stage was being set for the next performer. Some of these clips weren't show on the original U.S. video version.<br />Whether you're a Queen fan or not... whether you already own the VHS version or not ... get this DVD!! It's worth it and I guarantee... YOU WON'T EVER FORGET IT. If you are a Queen fan, grab some Kleenex because you will cry.
B00005B36H|3.0|Sure this is Tool, but we wait too long for such a great band to put out such a misguided effort as this...<BR>\\"Aenima\\" was well worth the wait after \\"Undertow\\"; it gave Tool a fresh sound and really made them live up to their namesake. The album was a journey (much like Nine Inch Nails' \\"The Downward Spiral\\") and kept you entranced throughout the entire experience.<BR>I can only assume that Tool was trying to mimic this experience in \\"Lateralus\\", but they fell rather short. The songs are for the most part rather tedious, and they don't allow the members to fully showcase their enormous talent. There were only a few decent songs on the album; again, a huge disappointment as every song on previous albums kicked rear. Even the \\"hidden song\\", which I can only assume was meant to sound creepy, was a joke.  I don't know, after hearing this I'm far more anticipating the follow up to A Perfect Circle's \\"Mer de Noms\\" than I am to Tool's next...
1586210912|5.0|This is the best book on Finance I have read. Excellent observations and suggestions in the book. Truly explains the difference between rich person and poor person's mindset. A Must Read.
B000002H33|5.0|.....that for whatever reason Metallica refuses to release any more masterful metal albums such as this.  Perhaps because of their producer, Bob Rock?  Ever since he came in, Metallica albums have been going downhill in quality, due to the fact that he wanted to capture more of their &quot;concert sound&quot;.  I guess this means that he no longer wants them to write songs with three or four guitar overlapped tracks, use less double bass or whatever else enabled the band to stand apart from so many other metal acts.  Or perhaps it's because they want to sell out (as if they don't have enough money already), or maybe even from old age so that now they're producing rockabilly tunes.  Who knows.<BR>Anyways, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; was the first Metallica album I picked up, and to this day stands as my personal favorite.  More than any other album does it showcase the full talent of the original (better) line-up, although &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; is pretty close.  This is also the only Metallica album where every song is excellent; no filler here.  Now, to a degree it does mimic other early Metallica in presentation, with the acoustic intro on &quot;Battery&quot;, the down-toned &quot;Sanitarium&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Orion&quot;, this still added up for a recipe of success in a provocative metal album.  &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is definitely the most recognizable song in the album, with some of the greatest riffs ever written, especially the breakdown about halfway into the song (and why, in concert, they often end the song right before this is another great mystery of Metallica).<BR>While many are saddened that Metallica has fallen from grace, writing garbage that should be on some rock and roll album not even worthy of their name, at the same time we should be greatful that albums such as &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; were released so at least we have memories of what a revolutionary metal band they once were...
0783240236|5.0|Along with \\"Psycho\\", this is definitive Hitchcock. With no music score, a terrifying tale is spun around a woman (Tippi Hedrin) who pursues a man to his home on the seacoast town of Bodega Bay and immediately birds begin acting strangely. Then violently. She becomes trapped at the home he shares with his dominating mother (a wonderful Jessica Tandy) and his little sister (a young Veronica Cartwright who grew up to be in \\"Alien\\"). Mitch (Rod Taylor) is single and is amused by Melanies'(Hedren) phony aloofness to him. But the birds start attacking in frighteningly unexpected mass attacks and everyone starts reevaluating their situations. Truly astonishing bird attacks are realistically done and the film becomes a sort of sci-fi survival story. Is it the end of the world? What is happening? These questions are disturbingly unanswered and the film does not end. Melanie is seriously attacked as the birds have invaded the house and Mitch, his mother and sister have to lead her away to the car and to an unknown future as their surroundings are covered with all manner of birds....waiting to strike again. Just an incredible film and the soundtrack alone of birds flapping and screeching will shred your nerves.
B00000FCBC|4.0|Alright, so this is the first Metallica album I bought since &quot;...And Justice For All&quot;, and for the most part I'm impressed.  At least with the second cd- I heard the &quot;Garage Days&quot; tunes from old tapes my friends had and I've been longing for a cleaned up collection of these tracks; well here we go.  However, what was a really nice surprise were the 5 tracks that followed, from &quot;Breadfan&quot; to &quot;Killing Time&quot;, which were B-sides that I'd never heard before, all with sounds reminiscient of the great &quot;Justice&quot; days.  Luckily, the songs on this disc were so good that they kept the album from getting less stars due to....<br />...the 1st disc. Not at all impressive, this disc represents the &quot;new&quot; Metallica: slow, weak, weighed down by ballads and an alternative/rockabilly sound.  This disc collects dust in my collection while the second disc is in the cd changer in my car.<br />All in all, &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; is a great album; normally I'd say stay away from any album released after they cut their hair, but this is an exception.  Then again, the songs that made this album so good were originally produced before their visit to the salon...
0783225849|5.0|The definitive Hitchcock film along with \\"The Birds\\", \\"Psycho\\" may not be as scary as it once was---but it's still an undisputed masterpiece of suspense and shock. Janet Leigh swipes $40,000 from her boss and heads out of town to escape her problems---the chief of which is her clandestine affair with her lover(John Gavin). After a nerve wracking journey, she finally pulls into the Bates motel for the night during a rainstorm. There she encounters Norman Bates, the nervous and twitchy proprieter, played by Anthony Perkins in the role that haunted him the rest of his life. Marion (Leigh) regrets her theft and plans to make things right the next day. But Norman is sexually attracted to her and spies on her through a convenient peep hole as she prepares for a shower. Then \\"Mother\\" intervenes and stabs Marion to death in the shower in what is probably the most famous scene in American film history. Gavin and Marions' sister Lila (Vera Miles) begin investigating Marion's disappearance by posing as guests at the motel. \\"Mother\\" is an enigma to everyone and they soon learn she died years ago under odd circumstances. Norman is suspiciously uncooperative and his bizarre private world begins to unravel. A detective snooping around on the couples' behalf meets a nasty death from \\"Mother\\" as well. The murder set pieces are designed to shock as is Lilas' gruesome discovery in the fruit cellar of the Bates' creepy old house. Bernard Herrmanns' famous shrieking score is still chilling. Acting is good (though Gavin is rather bland) but it's Perkins' show here and he is memorably effective as a truly disturbed psychotic. I don't know anyone who hasn't seen this but for anyone who hasn't it's a classic and should be seen at least once. The whole film is one big conversation piece from start to finish and a must for collectors.

1563898586|5.0|Think the Avengers or the JLA of the late 19th century. Mother England needs protection, so MI5 enlists those with proven courage under fire. They are: Mina Murray(Harker) of &quot;Dracula&quot;, Alan Quartermain (an Indiana Jones type character from pulp novels), the reluctant Captain Nemo from &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, Jekyll and Hyde, and Hawley Griffin, the Invisible Man.  <br />Of course, this isn't a typical adventure. It's a mystery, teeming with cameos and reference. When compared with writer Moore's other works, it is surprisingly humourous and lighter in subject matter. Moore does darken some of the charcters though, reminding us that Captain Nemo is an Indian prince embittered with England, Quartermain is an opium addict, and the Invisible Man ... well, just read it and see. <br />The art is, as always with Moore's works, reflective of the time period. The comic panels usually look like Victorian era etchings, which makes for a nice effect.<br />Overall, it is a great read, leaving you satisfied for having done so. More to the point, it will leave you desperately awaiting the live action movie this summer, starring Sean Connery as Allan, a role he was born to play. <br />Come on, it's Alan Moore. Just buy the sodding thing already.
0316666343|1.0|After reading all the positive professional reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. But, after reading the &quot;real&quot; people reviews, I decided not to. Especially after reading one review that said this book was &quot;as shallow as Bridges of Madison County&quot;. THAT book received rave professional reviews as well, while I thought it was the most inane piece of drivel that had ever wasted printing paper. Though I enjoy fiction, I still like substance in my reading. I'll pass on this one.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Tribal drums.  Thunderous bass.  Crushing riffs.  Primal screams.  And this is only the first track.  \\"Cochise\\", the first single from Audioslave's self-titled debut album, kicks the album off in a fury of guitars, drums, and vocals not heard since the days of greats like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin.  The standard set by this ferocious opening track is raised higher the further one gets into this album.  Featuring a plethora of muical styles, it appears that this most unlikely musical combo  has gelled into a powerful new entity.  Audioslave takes hard rock to new limits, showcasing singer Chris Cornell's(Soundgarden) soaring vocal lines over  killer grooves and monster riffs laid down by Tom Morello, Brad Wilk, and Tim Commerford, formerly of Rage Against the Machine.  Songs like \\"Show Me How to Live\\", \\"Gasoline\\", and \\"Exploder\\" are exactly what you were expecting to hear from this group.  These songs are equal parts RATM and Soundgarden.  That is definately not a complaint.  However, the real highlight to this album is not the balls-to-the-walls rockers, but the soulful, insightful ballads, most notably \\"Getaway Car\\" and \\"I Am the Highway\\".  Odds are, the Rage boys would have been shot on sight if they played these at a Rage rehearsal, but with the dynamics and grace of Cornell's vocal stylings, these are perhaps the most refreshing tracks on the album.  These are nothing new to Cornell, but the others must be amazed at how good it feels to stretch out musically.  <BR>But this album is much more than the RATM/Chris Cornell show.  It's the birth of Audioslave, and nowhere on this album is that more apparent than in the 3 songs not heard on the leaked demos, \\"What You Are\\", \\"Set it Off\\", and \\"Hypnotize\\".  \\"What You Are\\" is one of the most powerful pieces on the album, combining introspective lyrics with a great musical track.  \\"Set it Off\\" sounds more like Deep Purple or Zeppelin than any Soundgarden or RATM song, with a fury all its own.  Last but not least is \\"Hypnotize\\", a really intriguing track.  On first listen, I was really confused.  This was really new musical ground for everyone concerned.  It sounds basically like a techno track played by actual musicians.  But after a couple of listens, it just fits.  It's fresh, exciting, and really grabs your attention in the middle of the album.<BR>I suppose this wouldn't be a fair review if I didn't have a complaint.  That said, there was a track on the leaked demos called \\"Turn to Gold\\".  Where the hell did it go?  This was just an amazing song, complete with one of the coolest solos I ever heard.  Hopefully it will appear on a future album.  But this is really stretching, because I honestly love this CD.  Its so good to hear Chris Cornell singing with such entusiasm.  And how bout the Rage boys?  I alway knew they had it in them.  When I first caught wind of it, I was skeptical, mostly because I was really afraid Chris would rap.  But this is exactly what I expected.  Super tight rhythms, thunderous bass, killer riffs, and powerful vocals.  All in all, this is an amazing album.  Don't compare it to Soundgarden or RATM, cause this isn't any of those.  This is Audioslave.  This is something fresh and interesting in the world of crappy rock music.  This generation will finally have a guitar hero and a frontman worth of emulating.
0679720200|5.0|I'm a psychologist, so I especially like this book for Camus' portrait of psychological alienation from society. Also, I thought I might not like having a new translation of this classic text, but I find I do like it. Camus was influenced by Andre Gide, and I think Gide's Immoralist and his Lafcadio's Adventures both complement the psychological themes in Camus' stranger, so I pass those recommendations along. If you get into the Stranger, reading Camus' earlier draft version of his first novel, published as A Happy Death, is an interesting undertaking that I enjoyed.
B000075BFK|5.0|It was worth the wait and delays. this cd has so many hard beats. disc 1 is incredible. \\"still ballin\\", \\"when we ride on our enemies\\", \\"f*** em all\\", \\"street fame\\" all have the best beats ive heard since all eyez on me. the only real bad song on disc 1 is \\"thugz mansion\\" with nas. why would his mom put nas on his cd. the beat is terrible and doesnt go with the lyrics. disc 2 isnt as good but has some tight songs. the best would be \\"thugz mansion\\". 2pac is so real on it and anthony hamilton did a good job on the chorus. if u dont believe 2pacs alive listen 2 the \\"outro\\". 2pac fans might be skeptical but this cd is one of his best. go and buy the cd and make one more 2pac cd #1. <BR>by 2pacs #1 fan
B00005RHGL|4.0|I went to see the film when I was 19 with a friend just out of pure boredom.I went in anticipating a watered-down Hollywood movie where all the actors have mullets and bad southern accents.I left the theater dumbstruck by it's beauty.<BR> This is my second favorite western after &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;--a very CLOSE second.If you don't feel any romanticism for the old west after watching this movie,well,you just ain't human.The acting is top-notch,the set design is brilliant,and the costumes are perfect.This film was so good,that it just ruined Kevin Costner's subsequent &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; for me.&quot;Tomstone&quot; went almost un-noticed in late '93-early '94,but it has gained a great reputation of the years.I found it funny at the time when all of the critics complained of all of the mustaches in the film.I'm surprised they didn't complain about all of the six-shooters and cowboy hats!
0060090383|5.0|My first Keyes book was Watermelon, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but which left me with a sense of something missing. It kind of deserved the title \\"chick lit\\" or \\"beach reading.\\" It dealt with some serious situations, but it was basically fantasy. That's OK, I like escape reading.<br />Rachel's Holiday, however, had what Watermelon was missing: the bite of real life. The plot is summarized many times here, so I won't bother to repeat it. What I liked was Ms Keyes' ability to write a book about something serious, addiction, without losing her sense of humor, romance or fun. <br />\\"Lost Weekend\\" treatments of addiction are a dime a dozen. The ability to write about serious material without sacrificing what makes pleasure reading fun is far more rare. <br />I'll never forget the story of mild-mannered Neil, for example, who just likes \\"a few with the guys on Saturday night.\\" But then Keyes is so often hilarious that I laughed out loud every other page. <br />Helen, Rachel's nemesis of a sister, is always good for a funny scene. And then of course there is the romance with Luke, plus the sexy guy Rachel stumbles across in rehab....I even dreamed I was in the Cloisters, making friends with the brown sweaters and arguing with Sister Josephine.<br />I hope Rachel will play a role in the other sisters' stories. I liked her character and I'd love to see her story continue to unfold.<br />This was definitely a stay up all night read, so be sure to wait for a long weekend or holiday before starting this one. Also, beware of eating while you read!
0151008116|5.0|If I can say one thing about this book it is this, it will be unlike anything you have ever read.  Our main character Pi tells our writer that he has a story that will make him believe in God.  A tall order, as Pi is a practicing Catholic, Muslim, and Hindu.  The story Pi tells is an amazing one.  Now at first the idea of a teenage boy shipwrecked on a life boat with a tiger, a hyena, a orangutan and a zebra seems almost ridiculous to say the least, but trust me, it's anything but.  I read this book in one sitting, it had me that hooked.<br />The feel of this book is almost indescribable, yes it's surreal but by stripping down life to its' most basic elements (survival, strength, weakness, compassion, cruelty, resourcefulness and faith), it makes painfully clear how fragile our existance truly is.  I can't predict what you will believe after it's over, I know however you will be thinking about it for some time.  You will just have to read this one for yourself, now.
0060007737|5.0|Marketing guru Al Reis has again teamed with his daughter, Laura, president of their consulting firm, to bring us another book on marketing. This one focuses on branding, an area that has been misunderstood and misused for years-by some impressive companies. It's quite an educational experience to see how marketing giants stubbed their toes by violating one or more of Reis' Laws.<br />Why focus on branding? According to the authors, \\"Marketing is brand building. The two concepts are so inextricably linked that it's impossible to separate them. Furthermore, since everything a company does can contribute to the brand-building process, marketing is not a function that can be considered in isolation.\\" The branding concept should be of interest, therefore, to every executive and manager. <br />The book itself is unique. It's a slightly different size than the typical 6 X 9 business book. It's a paperback and very lightweight. HarperBusiness has produced a book that's so light, you can tuck it in your briefcase to carry a book with you without it being a burden. And the cover is orange. When's the last time you saw an orange business book? You might expect this book to be a bit contrarian, in your face, and maybe even a little disrespectful of all those marketing giants. You won't be disappointed. It's plainly written, not complicated, and may even appear simplistic at times.<br />The first part of this book presents chapter after chapter, explaining each of the 22 laws and giving examples of how companies have complied with or violated the laws in creating their brands. The authors pull no punches, providing evidence about how brands have won or lost, how they have built or destroyed companies, based on their understanding and application of Ries' Laws. The experiences shared can serve as valuable lessons to any company of any size.<br />The book as it is titled is finished at page 110. At that point, the authors take us on a journey through The 11 Immutable Laws of Internet Branding. This is a bonus you wouldn't expect, since it's not referenced in the title. There is a small-print reference on the cover, but these hints don't do justice the 125 pages of internet-focused content. With more space devoted to the emerging issues of internet branding, you can imagine the depth and challenging commentary you'll find in this half of the book. A comprehensive index completes the book.<br />This book will raise some eyebrows and perhaps embarrass a few anonymous marketing managers who made costly errors. More importantly, readers equipped with the knowledge and insight from this book will have a better chance of doing the right thing with their brand development in the future. Read this book before making any branding decisions and save yourself a lot of grief . . . and money.
B00006HBUC|1.0|Scooby Doo (the dog) looks fake and too computerized in this pathetic and distasteful movie to the popular Scooby Doo cartoons. Scooby Doo-The Movie might be rated PG, but it does contain some gross humor and mature content. That's not to say that it is a totally filthy movie, but it could've been a lot more appropriate than it was. The scene in which Scooby Doo and Fred are having a farting contest (?) is a bit distasteful. Also, unlike the Scooby Doo cartoons on TV, this movie might be a bit frightening to the younger set since it does have some scary stuff in it. So parents have been warned! This movie was just too gross and stupid to be a wholesome family entertaining picture. Sorry. That's just how I feel. It doesn't offend me a whole lot, but as a self-proclaimed family movie, I wouldn't recommend it for families.
6303269842|3.0|Maverick is an excellent example of why silly humour works but stupid humour doesn't.  It is at its best during the verbal and physical sparring between Mel Gibson and a likeably feisty Jodie Foster, but also occasionally plumbs the depths of incredibly unfunny ridiculousness.  Viewers familiar with the previous films of Gibson and director Richard Donner will appreciate the 'in' jokes liberally scattered throughout, and there are also some cameo appearances from a plethora of well-known country and western personalities.<br />Western movies aren't produced in such great numbers as they once were, so the setting is a refreshing change from the generic cityscape so often used in comedies.  Donner pokes fun at the dusty landscape and makes use of its well-worn stereotypes, but also hits some uncomfortable home truths, such as the displacement of native Americans.  <br />But the spatial setting is only peripheral to that all-consuming game, poker.  Bret Maverick wants to enter the All Rivers poker contest; the stumbling block being the entry fee of $25,000.  As it is, Southern belle Annabelle Bransford is all too willing to relieve him of what cash he has.  Chaperoned by respected lawman Zane Cooper they set off on a madcap money-hunt through the Wild West, helping stranded missionaries and avoiding old foes out for vengeance (including an unbelievably stupid sequence involving a Russian archduke with a penchant for killing). <br />The plot meanders along for three-quarters of the movie's length until suddenly we are bombarded with multi-layered double-crossings, which may require a second viewing to satisfactorily disentangle.   However, the final twist in the tail is likely to leave the viewer with a grin, just as it does Bret Maverick.
0790742780|4.0|I first saw this movie a couple years ago and enjoyed it.  I didn't see it as a film about \\"white middle class rage\\"; I simply saw it as a film about any person's rage, be they white, black, latino, asian, or any other ethnic group.  There are times I feel like Michael Douglas's character-angry, frustrated, and ready to take out anyone or anything that gets in my way.  Of course, life is too short to be pissed off, which is conveyed at the end

0066214122|4.0|Although he will never win the Nobel Prize for literature, Michael Crichton is, to my mind, the only readable mainstream writer. That he also happens to be one of the most successful - and richest - does not in any way cheapen that. His writings, from the start, have been highly technical, and certainly a lot more meaty than the standard bestseller fare. The fact that he has such an exceptional history in sales owes more to his ideas (bringing back dinosaurs, anyone?) than to his actual writing style or crossover potential. Crichton has long had a knack for taking hot contemporary issues (American-Japanese relations, sexual harrassment, airplane problems) and turning them into interesting, learned, and highly readable novels. He continues this trend with his newest book, Prey. Of course, Crichton does enjoy his mainstream success while juggling complex material for a reason: his books are inevitably fun, fast-paced and exciting, and highly suspenseful. He writes in such a way that his books are almost impossible to put down (I read the great majority of this book in one marathon early morning session - staying up until 7:30 in the morning - because I absolutely could not pry my fingers away from the book.) Crichton tackles a new - and emerging, though not exactly prescient - subject in this novel: nanotechnology. While this is not as exciting or appealing to the average Joe as dinosaurs, it has the Janus-esque virtue of being appealing to the tech nerds who read Crichton's books - and is also written in such an exciting and invigorating way that the normal, everyday reader won't care. Narrarated in the first-person, this book starts out slowly, as Crichton novels tend to, as we see life through the eyes of an ex-computer programmer - now an unemployed stay-at-home dad. One must admire Crichton for taking risks in his books: despite his well-earned reputation and instant commercial potential, he still tackles complex and controversial issues such as gender roles in domestic situations. The protagonist of Prey takes care of the kids, cooks, and shops while his wife works late hours, is consistently late, and sometimes never shows up at all. Eventually, he begins to think she is having an affair - all of which adds up to an interesting subplot for the book. The book is somewhat oddly paced, as it starts out slowly and then, very suddenly and without warning, drops right into the main action part of the book - which goes on almost non-stop for roughly three fourths of the novel (not to mention Crichton's frequent technical discussions.) Still, this is a book that I think everyone can enjoy, as it is written very appealingly, while also incorporating some very provocative and interesting concepts. It may be easy, in light of the long and storied history of literature, to dismiss Crichton as a mere template writer (his actual prose has never been anything to write home about), but I think that, in today's almost totally stagnant literary climate, he serves a useful function: introducing complex, technical subjects to the masses. There hasn't really been a writer who has done that consistently since H.G. Wells. We should be thankful for him. Prey is an immensely exciting and quite worthy novel, a distinct improvement over his last book, Timeline, that all fans of Crichton, and all of today's readers, would be rewarded by picking up.
0380789035|4.0|I approached this book with some trepidation. Although I'm a huge fan of Gaiman's writing, I was afraid that the scope and length of the novel would leave something wanting - it clocks in at nearly 600 paperback pages, close to twice as long as his next-longest book. I was scared that like so many other authors I have enjoyed in the past, he had succumbed to the terrible author's disease where they write in bulk and all their editors are scared to make any cuts.<br />I was wrong.<br />Neil Gaiman shines again, cementing himself firmly as one of our best modern authors, and one with a tremendous range. &quot;American Gods&quot; has elements to appeal to fantasy, horror, mystery, and spiritual readers, as well as a plot evoking the classic road novel. I would normally be frightened to utter all those genres in the same sentence, but Gaiman makes it all gel together. It's a vast work that will leave you awed.<br />That's not to say I don't have a few slight criticisms. Although the book is very tight and doesn't have a lot of padding, I can't give it five stars because I simply start to feel overwhelmed by books over rughly 400 pages...I, as a reader, start to lose steam, which ultimately makes me lose some interest. Also, it's worth pointing out that those new to Neil Gaiman should read something -else- first...&quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot;, &quot;Stardust&quot; (novel or graphic novel version), or my personal favorite, &quot;Neverwhere&quot;. These are equally fascinating, but less lengthy or intense, works that are simply more accessible. You might even try a couple of &quot;Sandman&quot; collections (to which, it must be admitted, this novel bears the most similarity).<br />On the other hand, if you've read a couple things by Gaiman already, this is a great book to try. It makes a lovely summer or holiday read, and it's tremendous fun to play &quot;identify the old-world god&quot; as you go along.  Here's hoping Neil Gaiman continues to experiment, and to enthrall us with his incredible imagination. Very recommended.us with his incredible imagination. Very recommended.
B00000DHRX|4.0|This double-disk George Michael collection definitely keeps the hits coming with a large amount of top 10 hits. Of those hits, seven #1 hits are present including \\"Careless Whisper,\\" \\"Father Figure,\\" \\"Faith,\\" \\"One More Try,\\" \\"Monkey,\\" \\"I Knew You Were Waiting For Me\\", and \\"Praying For Time.\\" I mainly bought this album for just a couple songs. The big one being \\"Careless Whisper\\" which still stands as my all-time favorite 80's ballad. I received a pleasent surprise though when I listened and realized just how many great songs George Michael had. \\"Jesus To A Child\\" is a gorgeous *but lengthy* ballad and Michael's vocals are stunning. \\"Kissing A Fool\\" *a #5 hit from his debut* is another stand-out and who can forget \\"Faith?\\" My big complaint is the version of \\"I Want Your Sex\\" that is included here. I much rather would've had Part 1. That's the reason for the 4 star rating. Also, I believe one disk would have been sufficent. The few filler tracks that are here could've been left off. But despite these complaints, the album is definitely worth it! Also, if you like late-80's music, I recommend greatest hits albums by Debbie Gibson, Roxette, and Expose.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I went to a Strokes concert at Roseland Ballroom last friday. After the less-than-inspiring opening act had finished, after Jimmy Fallon (who is a lot less humorous on a stage in front of 3,000 people, especially when you can't hear his jokes)  and Jack Black had finished their disappointing surprise apearances and after the DJ had finished playing an hour and a half of migraine-inducing house music, I realized why i spent 40 dollars on a scalped ticket, 15 dollars on train tickets, and another 20 on ridiculously expensive venue-bar cigarettes and beer. THE STROKES WERE QUITE POSSIBLY THE BEST SHOW I HAD SEEN, EVER. their album may sound a little more poppy than fans of their main influences--early-punk rock bands like clash and ramones--might like, but their shows are pure adrenaline and rock and roll. though their set lasted little over an hour, by the end i was soaked in sweat, exuberant and spent. if you dont think this review is going anywhere, you may be right. but heres the message im trying to convey: the album is damn good by itself. it stands alone quite well as a piece of studio-recorded musical accomplishment. i have very diverse music tastes. (the last show i saw was Badly Drawn Boy. i get into morcheeba, joni mitchell, supreme beings of leisure and sense field, jack johnson, john mayer, counting crows and hundreds more.) a lot of the stuff i like wouldnt really be classified as rock, but the strokes hooked me. their energy belies the catchy, melodic pop below the guitar riffs. i had listened to it and enjoyed it before going to the show. but after the show, every song i hear brings back a memory of the show and sounds that much more alive, raucus and beautiful for it. in other words: BUY THE CD, BUT DON'T MISS THE SHOW!!!!!!!
0099588110|5.0|Angela Carters book the Bloody Chamber can only be described as sparkling genious. Carter writes with the combination of the classic fairy tale, and magical realism, incorperating elements of gothic horror,and subversive sexuality. She weaves tales of sinister locations, fearsome monsters,and powerful heroes to leave the reader with a slanted version of an old moral. Her interpretations are brought to life by her powerful descriptions and modern settings. Her stories are proof that this genre can still terrify off screen. The Bloody Chamber is truely one of the finest pieces of gothic liteature of the century.
B000075BFK|4.0|This album has good beats and rhymes but I've noticed that it is a lot less agressive than past Tupac albums...there seems to be a complete change of attitude...seemingly more positive and whatnot...I like the second disc a lot more than the first one..the one thing I don't like this album is that it is kind of repetitive..and I agree..where are is all this new material coming from?...
078062999X|5.0|Never seen the whole play done until now. Most directors lop off sections, but Branagh is the first, in my experience, not to shy away from what some see as the boring parts. This feels like a completely new piece, instead of the play that I've read dozens of times.
B00005JL78|5.0|Like on my title, Steven Speilberg's \\"Minority Report\\" is arguebly the best damn sci-fi movie ever made! It's not very dark or cryptic like \\"The Matrix\\" or Speilberg's brillant \\"A.I.\\", but it's almost a mirrored look into our upcoming future, that's why Spielberg wanted the movie set in 2054. From 2002, that's 52 years from now. Many people said that our future might not look like that in the future in \\"Minority Report\\" 52 years from now, but come on, it could. Maybe we might reach the evolved state where we can invent better technologies within days in the future (I hope you guys understand what I'm saying). Think about all the advances in the future that we might accomplish, we might accompish them very fast. Well, enough with my techno-babbling. Let's get down to what also makes this movie so freaking great. Tom Cruise gives his best work since \\"Born on the Fourth of July\\", you can just see how drenched into character he's in of the role of John Anderton. And that scene with future superstar Colin Farrell as Det. Danny Witwer, where he stops the ball rolling of the table, and Tom Cruise says \\"The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.\\" What a great line!. The movie is set in the future where we can prevent crime before it happens. When the process started the murder rate has been down 0% for 6 years. Instead of having a cop travel through time and preventing the crime, (which would have a scientific risk of having time altered) they rely on phychics known as pre-cogs. Which are connected to head gear in a contained compartment, they lay in a pool surrounded by fresh water that puts them in a comfortable trance to pick up readings of soon to happen crimes. In the movie John Anderton (Cruise) has been framed for a murder he was-about-to-commit, which sparks a terrific mystery brought together through great directing and writing. The use of psychics is a very interesting exploration of the future of law enforcement. The supporting cast that includes Max Von Sydow, Lois Smith, Tim Blake Nelson, Peter Stormare, and the excellant Samantha Morton as the Pre-cog Agatha, a homage to the legendary mystery writer Agatha Cristie, all of the performers are great. Speaking of mystery, this movie feels like a classy mystery. Which is also one of the other reasons what makes this film so original. It's like \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" (1941) meets Phillip K. Dick, who wrote the short story for the basis of the movie. \\"Blade Runner\\" which is also based on a Phillip K. Dick story which was also brilliant, but a little too out there. \\"Minority Report\\" is a movie that really doesn't go overboard, but stays on the board that is meant to stay on. Like all the good things i've been talking about the look of the future in the movie, this future looks errie and convicing. The movie is dark, but not end-of-world dark; But a kind of prediction on where our future is heading. Not only that but it's a great movie. With great suspense, great action, great cinematograhpy, great dialogue, a pulse-pounding musical score by the legendary John Williams, a great script by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, great performances, a great Tom Cruise, and above all, a great Steven Spielberg. Spielberg will always be on the top of his game. THIS WHOLE MOVIE IS GREAT!. It is #1 on my list of sci-fi movies like \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (1968), \\"The Matrix\\" (1999), \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" (1966), \\"A.I.\\" (2001), and both Terminator movies. The greatest sci-fi movie ever made!.Period.

630438551X|3.0|Okay, what didn't make sense is how the movie can take place in modern day and still have Shakespearean language. In some parts of the movie this takes away the whole beauty of Shakespeare. Unfourtunatly whenever they make a movie out of a Shakespeare play, it isn't really that good. Clair Danes played a good Juliet, Leonardo Dicaprio wasn't that good of a Romeo(sorry for anyone thats a fan of his).Although I must say this version of Romeo and Juliet is better than the one that they made back in 1968, thats why I am giving this version 3 stars.
6301442962|5.0|I first saw this film when I was 13 years old and it instantly became one of my favorite films and is still so 20 years later.  On the surface the film seems somewhat unbelievable.  The story of a man who thinks he is Kris Kringle (aka Santa Claus)somehow convinces major department stores that they should put the interest of the consumer above their own interests and then attempts to prove in court he is the one and only Santa Claus is somewhat unbelievable.  However, the great cast, the well written story and the time this film was released, just after WWII, makes the story seem almost plausible.<br />I really enjoy the final scene in the film in which Fred Gailey, the attorney who defended Kris Kringle, is commenting to Doris Walker on the believability of Santa Claus when he notices something in the corner that makes him reconsider the statement he is making.  This scene is so important because it shows the hypocrisy that man can have.  Here we have  man who has encouraged others to believe in Santa Claus and even defended a man who claims to be Santa Clause even though he may not believe in Santa Claus himself and now he is forced to reconsider his beliefs.<br />I have seen the 73 and 94 remake of this film and while I did enjoy the 73 version &amp; hated the 94 version neither are better than the original.  There is a 1956 version of the film called MEET KRIS KRINGLE that is never aired and not available for purchase that I would like to see.  I saw a clip of that film and the actor that portrays Kris Kringle seems far less believable than Edmund Gwenn.  The actress the portrays Susan seems a little older and no where near as charming as Natalie Wood.  However I would still like to see the version if for no other reason I can then say I've seen all 3 remakes of this film.<br />I purchased the didgitally remastered VHS version of this film and found it be an excellent product.  Great picture and sound.  I really enjoyed the orginal trailer.  I wanted to purchase the DVD but found that it offered nothing different than the VHS version.  This film deserves special features. Behind the scene footage and a documentary would be nice.  Several of the actors and actresses are still alive including Maureen O'Hara that could provide commentary for this film.  So until the DVD producers add some more material to this DVD I will just use my VHS version.ase the DVD but found that it offered nothing different than the VHS version.

6300216039|2.0|I read the play Romeo and Juliet in my Shakespeare class, and thought is was a very good play. But when I saw this movie I was very dissapointed. The acting in the movie is just HORRIBLE.On all the parts, it is either overdone or underdone.And on top of that,they cut out alot of dialogue toward the end.I think there is a reason why Shakespeare wrote these plays for the stage. I would reccomend the version with Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Daines over this one.

B0000542D2|4.0|This is one of the great films from the 1960s and should be seen by everyone at least once during their lifetime. <br />The film has held up very well and the editing still looks innovative nearly 40 years later.  One thing that is very noticeable with this set is that the music has been digitally remastered and the sonic quality of the songs is markedly different from the dialogue in the rest of the movie.  <br />The extra disc provides a lot of insight into the making of the film and the whole Beatles scene.  Everyone from Richard Lester to the tailor and hairdresser on the film talk about their memories.  Klaus Voorman gives an interesting interview where he shows drawings that he made during the early years of Beatlemania.  There is also a documentary on the first disc that repeats clips from some of the interviews on disc 2 but most of the insights are unique to this special.  <br />Despite the fact that there is a lot of bonus content, even more would have been appreciated.  While there is an interview with the man who designed the film's movie poster, an actual gallery of posters and lobby cards would have been appreciated.  It would have also been appropriate to include theatrical trailers for the film.  This set does include DVD-ROM content but I did not have access to it so perhaps these things are located there.  <br />Other things that could've been added to disc 2 include deleted scenes shown in &quot;You Can't Do That! The Making of 'A Hard Day's Night'&quot; and the &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot; intro that was added to the film when it was re-released in the 1980s.  Richard Lester's &quot;Running Jumping Standing Still&quot; film should have also been included since it's mentioned so much on the DVD. <br />For fans of 1960s cinema or the Beatles, this set is a keeper.  Here's hoping &quot;Help!&quot; gets similar treatment someday.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|this movie lack all attraction to the public because the bad edition of the scenes, the history is a mediocre play of the writer . the especial effects are lost in the threshold of profesionality. the drama drown with its awful documentation to the viewer. wich a half of hour of seeing the movie fall to a deep sleep and enter in the desperation to get out the cinema but didnt because of the money he spend and he had to wait the terrible anghish of the time remaining to arrive to my bed and trying to erase the terrible image of &quot;the beautiful mind&quot; please dont make a terrible film like this again to avoid wining the lord of the rings, wich is a new zeland film
B00007E8V4|3.0|OK there is a simple reason these songs weren't on the last studio release. They are not that good. I gave it a 3 because I am a huge System fan. But to be honest this disc was a let down. They did the classic SOAD move and over produced these tracks. I had some of them from the Net- Intervision, Streamline, and F the System and to be honest they re-did them from what I already had, and the versions I had were better then the ones on this disc. Why fix something that isn't broken. Save yourself the money and download these songs from Kazza

0761536434|5.0|This is a very engaging read, especially for those who grew up in the 60-70's. A veritable trip down memory lane.  Only one can hope that this author or others pick up the topic and write the histories of some of the contemporary players such as Sony as well as the very well know development houses that  developed Civilization, Doom, Quake, the RTS genre players, etc.  Aside from &quot;Game Over&quot; and &quot;Zap&quot; I think the shelves are kind of bare.

B0000025DV|5.0|I am lucky enough to come from the city that E.L.O was formed in ( Birmingham,England).I have all of E.L.O`s music and they are my favorite group.Jeff Lynne is most underated writer/producer  and this i do not understand.When listening to albums like On The Third Day,Elderado and Out Of The Blue,it feels like Shakespeare himself wrote the lyrics.Out Of The Blue is a masterpiece and the fact that Jeff Lynne only took two weeks to write it is quite amazing.A concerto for a rainy day is superb,the way the music blends in with the weather sounds is very clever.Jeff Lynne wrote ALL the lyrics and music on his own,not just Out Of The Blue but all the other albums,apart from a couple of songs.Out Of The Blue is a must have album and out of all of E.L.O`s albums this is the best produced.
B00006LFGD|3.0|Alright. The VOICE is still intact, and there's no denying that thrill when hearing her sing a new song -- even if that song is a pop banality such as either of the 2 new duets included here. Among the new pairings, Groban wins hands down in being a formidable vocal partner for Streisand, though there's no emotional connection, while Manilow's croon is fairly innocuous in this context. The other tracks, all available to fans before, sound terrific with the remastering.  Performance-wise,  the Mathis duet remains an underrated joy of overproduced but thrilling pop, while for sheer instinctive bravura, Garland towers above all others, unless you count Streisand herself in the great \\"One Less Bell to Answer/A House is Not A Home\\" medley.  And the packaging graphics are pretty hip, especially compared to the last few albums.  But still, I would have rather waited a year or two for a real sophisticated and exciting duets project with new performances from beginning to end, rather than the obligatory slick stocking stuffer offered here instead.  Nothing wrong with most of the the music inside, but a shame that we may never hear Streisand opposite, say, Aretha Franklin, Tony Bennett, Linda Ronstadt, Elton John, Bette Midler, Luther Vandross, James Taylor -- someone who has the chops, maturity, class, personality and pop savvy to spark and illuminate what is still one of the best voices in pop music today.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|I love music of all decades, but I don't see how the Beatles were ever popular.  The songs are just bad.  There is so much better music that came out of this decade.  They have bad voices, and there isn't anything that they sing that comes out in the right note.  It sounds like they just found four guys on the street, and told them to sing, without ever practicing.  To me, they just sound out of sync, like a Kindergarten play.  Each time I hear one of their songs, the lyrics sound more ridiculus each time.  How did these songs ever reach number one?
1586210912|2.0|This is probably the worst personal finance book I have ever read. I almost gave up after page 20.  The style and flow is horribly kindergarten and the ideas so rudimentary that it's hard to believe anyone agreed to print it.    RDPD contains a very basic thread which tells you to maximise your asset growth to cover your outgoings (duh!) and then goes on to tell you something about how Kiyosaki became a millionaire. Exactly what is true and how one should start geting rich is pretty hazy. Financial details are thin and his methods vague at best.    It's more of a motivational perk-me-up than a useful guide to making money and achieving financial independence.  If there is something positive to come out of the book, it's Kiyosaki's constant preaching that a house is just as much a liability as an asset and buying the family home early on in life can seriously impede your ability to achieve financial independence through leveraging your balance sheet.
B00006RAKP|4.0|I must say that this is definetely the best collection of Elton John songs.  If you are a fan of Elton, this is a great album to get.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is because there are a few songs that I don't care for, however, it is still a great album.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Anyone who seriously dislikes this film is without the ability to feel.  I will stand by that whole-heartedly until someone can tell me why I'm wrong.<br />If not, they're just squeamish.  Requiem is a glimpse of what happens when hope clouds the mind and narrows one's line of sight.  The message of the film, much misinterpretted by the majority of the reviewers on this site, is not blatantly anti-drug.  All four protagonists are driven by dreams, working toward happiness the only way they know how.  None of them stops to think about the means by which they are trying to get there; the ends they desire will justify anything they have to do along the way.  Or will they?<br />Aronofsky's cinematography is fantastic.  His \\"hip hop montages\\" that string together the parallel plots are aurally and visually refreshing, although semi-reminiscient of Pi's pill-popping sequences.  The soundtrack is gorgeous and deeply moving, most notably the chilling \\"Summer Overture\\" that begins and ends the film.  Everything about the movie is beautiful.  Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Connelly pull off their parts superbly.  Hell, Marlon Wayans is surprisingly incredible as Ty, Harry(Leto)'s right hand man.  I can't say enough about the quality of this film.<br />There are scenes that, no matter how often I replay them, strike a chord within me that brings a wave of tears to my eyes.  The emotion is the real star of the story.  Do yourself a favor and watch it.  If you are not deeply moved, scarred, or changed by it in any way, please tell me how, because I simply cannot understand.

B00006M183|4.0|Ok, let me get a couple of things straight from the outset. Im a huge Pearl Jam fan, and I didnt buy this album expecting, or wanting, to hear 'Ten' part two. In that respect, I wasnt disappointed. This certainly isnt a rehash of anything theyve ever done before: Pearl Jam cosistently branch out into new musical directions without sacrificing their artistc integrity or failing to showcase the remerkable talents of each and every band member that got us all interested in the first place. Sadly though, this certainly isnt Pearl Jam's best album. Its not their best since 'Ten', or their best since 'Vs', or better than 'Vitalogy' or 'No code'. Dont get me wrong, its not their worst either: it has wonderful moments. But let me tackle this in detail.<br />I was struck at first by the way the albums two opening tracks act as a kind of simulacrum of the No Code formula. A slow opener, building into a racuous, full throttle rocker for the second track. Its a formula that worked perfectly in 1996: sadly, 'Cant Keep' and 'Save you' just arent anywhere near as good as 'Sometimes' and 'Hail hail', precipitating unwelcome comparisons. Despite this, 'Save You' is a great track, and the albums only real straightahead rocker. After all this negativity, now would be a good time to bestow some praise on one man: Matt Cameron. He contributes more to this album than Binaural, and im massively impressed. Many people forget he penned some of the best Soundgarden tunes, and hes well up to standard here. 'You are' is my favourite track here: a truly stunning song which takes Pearl Jam into uncharted waters, a really strange song that Ive fallen in love with irrevocably. Thanks to this Id honestly say its worth buying the album just for that track. Unfortunately one great track doesnt make a wonderful album. What we have here is a good album. 'Cropduster' and 'get right', camerons other compositions, are superb, 'I am mine' really is great, as is the folky 'thumbing my way', which once again shows us just what a diverese, talented songsmith Vedder is. Elsewhere, half full, and all or none provide other highlights. Its a good album, but i cant help feeling if it had all been up to the standards of you are or I am mine, it could have been their best. Still worth buying, even for the casual fan. Pearl jam continue to evolve and immpress, but theres an essential fire that has gone.hows us just what a diverese, talented songsmith Vedder is.

0066214122|3.0|I'm a big MC fan and have greatly enjoyed all of his previous books with the exception of Terminal Man & now, Prey.<br />The problem with his latest is that it is a bit close to the now typical MC scenario. We know the protagonist isn't going to die because MC chose to write the book in first person. When the hero describes the players in the scenario, we as readers literally pick who is going to suffer the book's titular fate and who is not. (For the record, I was right about the victims!) We then turn pages to see how close we were to our predictions and also to see how gruesome their particular fates are going to be.<br />This is normally escapist fun but this book is a shade too melodramatic and formulaic to reach that level. Also, while resurrecting dinosaurs on a large scale & traveling to another dimension/time is obviously not plausible, MC truly made it seem like these advances in technology were right around the corner. The technology here - nanobots \\"breeding\\" and turning slightly malevolent in their choice of sustenance while the protagonist happens to be the only person able to stop them - is just too far away to make it seem like this is possible; this book is a shade too clearly on the science fiction portion of the literary spectrum. The final fate of some of the book's characters is pretty far out there.<br />I will say that I shivered and got itchy while reading the book & that I had to read it in one sitting just to see where it was going. I also enjoyed one portion that seemed nearly lifted from 'Aliens'. However, this is the 'Star Trek 3' of MC's oeuvre - wait for the paperback and its sure-to-be-lurid cover if you simply must read it.
B000066NW0|5.0|Ill agree, Avril isnt exactly hardcore punk, but does that really matter? Her music is enjoyable to listen to, and it really makes you wanna dance and sing along with the music. If you've heard any of her songs and have enjoyed them, I think you'll really like this CD.
B00008DDXL|5.0|When I first went to see this film in the theater, it had been a while since I read the book, so I came to \\"Harry II\\" without any clear recollection of the plot, and expected, from the hints I'd read, something really \\"down\\" and scary.  Well, scary it can get--the whole basilisk sequence is definitely not for people who get nervous around snakes, and don't even *consider* watching if, like Ron Weasley, you're afraid of spiders!  Yet in the end this film, like its predecessor, reaffirms plenty of positive values--courage, selflessness, quick thinking, honesty, loyalty. Harry and his friends must stand by gamekeeper Hagrid and Headmaster Dumbledore in a time of trial, deal with a charismatic but not at all truthful new Professor (Kenneth Branagh doing a wonderful turn, with lots of charm and a great wardrobe), and solve the mystery of who, or what, is leaving students literally petrified all over the corridors of Hogwarts School.   <br /> <br />The young stars are even better this time out than they were in their first outing; Daniel Ratcliffe (Harry) suitably serious and focused, Emma Watson (Hermione) a perfect prodigy, and Rupert Grint (Ron) displaying a genuine gift for comic emphasis.  All the old cast is back--Professors McGonagall and Snape, Harry's rival Draco Malfoy, quidditch-team captain Oliver Wood, Nearly Headless Nick the Gryffindor ghost, Ron's older twin brothers Fred and George, Harry's horrible Muggle kin the Dursleys--and there are a few new ones too, including Hermione Grainger's Muggle parents (briefly seen in the bookshop in Diagon Alley), Draco's sinister but stunningly handsome father, Mr. Weasley, mistress-of-the-greenhouses Professor Sprout, a new ghost named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the bathroom where she died (and provides an important clue in Harry's quest for the answers), and the magically preserved sixteen-year-old self of the mysterious Tom Riddle, who attended Hogwarts 50 years ago.  The special effects are, if anything, even betterthan they were in the first movie--that basilisk is worth the price in himself, not to mention a flying car, Dobby the house-elf, and a second chilling Quidditch match.  The one scene I had feared--Harry's discovery of caretaker Filch's obnoxious cat, Mrs. Norris, after the mysterious petrifier has had its way with her--turned out to be nowhere near as bad as I had expected.  Despite its length, time literally flew--there's never a moment of boredom.  <br /> <br />You will want to think twice before letting very young or sensitive children view \\"Chamber of Secrets,\\" but for all the rest of the 90% or so of the known world that's \\"just wild about Harry,\\" this is a must-see. And a must-buy, now that it's on video! <br /> <br />
B00003CXCW|5.0|Any film fan has to see the image quality on this DVD.  This is one of the most scrumptious and involving black and white transfers ever.  The blacks are dead black, the whites and greys gleam, and the gradations of light are breathtakingly nuanced.  Every frame is crisp and clear when it should be, and there isn't a scratch or speckle.  I've seen Sunset Blvd. in all sorts of formats, from 35 mm museum screenings to the mushy VHS released years ago;  this tops anything.  I'm a Billy Wilder fan, but I was never dazzled by his visuals until I saw this disc.<br />I do have gripes with the extras.  The &quot;Making of...&quot; documentary seems skimpier than befits a film of this stature.  Granted that nearly all the major participants are dead, but most were interviewed extensively over the years;  indeed, when the Sunset Blvd. musical was hyped, Wilder was all over the media, so surely clips of him could have been used.  And near the end of her life Swanson was often on talk shows, especially when she was plugging her autobiography.  Among the more interesting extras for hardcore fans are the film's trailer, which features alternate takes of several shots, and two versions of the infamous deleted morgue opening scene (with some silent footage from it).<br />The real disappointment is the commentary track by Wilder biographer Ed Sikov.  His is the kind of commentary that drives DVD fans to despair:  it's of the &quot;Hey-look-at-that!&quot; variety.  Sikov is either telling us what we are seeing on the screen or what we are about to see;  unfortunately, he doesn't do much more than that.  He gives very little background on the production, very little analysis.  I know this isn't a scholarly Criterion release, but surely there could have been some fresh insights, some depth here.  What was Swanson like in her silent films?  Why was the Stroheim-Swanson collaboration Queen Kelly (excerpted in Sunset Blvd.) a disaster?  Did De Mille and Swanson ever work together?  You'llnever know from the commentary track.  (The documentary fills in a few of the gaps, but unsatisfactorily.)  And Sikov's failure to identify silent-star Franklyn Farnum (the monkey's undertaker)in his commentary seems a weird lapse.<br />But there are plenty of books that can give you the info missing from the extras.  What matters here is that is a stupendous film in a lustrous transfer to disc.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I ought to say, &quot;wows 'em for the first time&quot;--you don't need to have read the books to enjoy the film (I hadn't, though after seeing it I went out and bought #1 and #3 (#2 being OS at my bookstore)). I haven't been so caught up in a movie's world since the first STAR WARS of venerable memory. The cast, except *just per-haps* for the theatrically glowering Rickman, is splendid, the settings are gorgeous, and oh, the SFX! The quidditch match alone is worth the price. <br />Some reviewers take Columbus and his screenwriters to task for not following the book exactly, but I think they've improved upon it. The means by which Harry and his pals first happen upon Fluffy the three-headed dog, for example: instead of a mischievous poltergeist, it's moving stairways that land them in the forbidden corridor--visually far more delightful. And the scene in which Harry and Ron play &quot;wizard chess&quot; with pieces that bash each other foreshadows the full-size game perfectly. On the other hand, where they *have* remained faithful to the original, they've done so, for the most part, with exactitude. My gripes are very minor: for example, I would have liked a brief scene in which the several Weasley brothers were formally introduced to Harry (there is one in the book, but in the movie I didn't realize Ron had brothers till I saw their names in the cast roll). <br />This is definitely a movie for the whole family, though the smallest ones *may* find Fluffy, Hagrid, Lord Voldemort, and the chess game scary. And having been through a rather stressful three weeks the first time I saw it (in the theater), I found it to be just the remedy I needed. For a couple of hours I could completely forget what had been turning my life upside down, and worry about whether Harry was going to fall off his broom when *it* did! If I could give this video *ten* stars, I would.  It belongs in every family collection.
B00007E8V4|5.0|i'm suprised nobody has reviewed this album yet.  If you are a soad fan, this is a definate purchase.  there is nothing *new* here so if you don't like them, this prolly won't win you over.  don't mistake this album as a &quot;b-sides&quot; release of stuff that wasn't good enough for their full releases.  from start to finish they continue to amaze.  i've only listened to it a few times all the way through, but there are already songs stuck in my head ;)
B00005JL95|5.0|When I saw this movie advertised as being \\"PG\\" rated, I couldn't understand why an animated film would labor under such a restriction. On the other hand, considering that almost every Disney animation has its scary bits (think the Wicked Witch in the studio's very first full-length animated feature, \\"Snow White\\"), maybe it's overdue. <br />Stitch (so named by Lilo, the six-year-old Hawaiian girl who buys him from the State pound under the misapprehension that he's a dog) is really Experiment 626--an intelligent, all-but-invulnerable, six-limbed, blue-furred, keen-eared, grotesque-yet-loveable genetic construct designed as a living war machine (his creator, alien scientist Jumba Jookiba, says he will be inevitably \\"attracted to large cities\\"). Condemned to a prison asteroid by the Galactic Council, he escapes in a stolen police boat and ends up on Earth, hotly pursued by Jumba (paroled for the purpose) and a Council observer, the monocular Pleakley. Here he becomes a member of the \\"ohana\\" (family in Hawaiian) of Lilo and her big sister/guardian Nani, who are struggling to stay together despite interference from Social Services, while Lilo uses fantasy and acting-out to cope with the apparently very recent accidental death of their parents. Unable to leave the sisters' little island (his molecular structure is too dense to cope with water), and therefore thwarted in his need to find a \\"large city,\\" he eventually bonds with Lilo (a touching scene occurs in her bedroom when she tells him about her parents and asks if he too has lost loved ones--\\"I hear you crying in your sleep,\\" she says), and after a couple of hilariously failed attempts to be a \\"model citizen\\" on the order of Lilo's hero, Elvis, he redeems himself by rescuing her after his nemesis, Captain Gantu of the Galactic Space Navy (who resembles a giant whale on two legs), more or less inadvertantly kidnaps her. A delightful montage of \\"photographs\\" under the closing credits suggests that he and the sisters, with Nani's would-be boyfriend David, social worker and ex-CIA agent Cobra Bubbles, and the two exiled aliens, eventually form an \\"ohana,\\" with holiday celebrations together, picnics on the beach, and even a trip to the Mainland to visit Graceland. <br />Some of the aliens, like Jumba and Gantu, may scare the youngest kids, but probably not if they've already seen and enjoyed \\"Shrek\\" or \\"Monsters Inc.\\" (Others are small and cuddly, resembling beloved stuffed animals.) One very positive alien is Madame President of the Council: though not human or conventionally female in appearance, she's referred to as \\"she\\" from the beginning, and may remind adult viewers of certain teachers from their past--strict, yet just. The sequence in which David and the girls introduce Stitch to the joys of surfing is particularly well done, and the pursuit of Gantu in his small spaceboat by Nani, Stitch, Jumba, and Pleakley in a bigger one, is full of thrills and thunderous background music. There are plentiful humorous bits, like Jumba and Pleakley's attempts to blend into the background and the denouement of Bubbles's past. I would personally have preferred more Hawaiian and original music in the score and less Elvis, but that's a personal quirk.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Some reviewers stating Jones's influences are unfair with Eddie Brickell. Jones owes her a lot , specially her very personal phrasing so musical and slightly childish. Jones' s choice of songs also reminds me of Brickell's greatest hits.
B000031WD9|1.0|I was advised by a friend who is in my age group (early 30s) that this is one of the funniest movies ever made. It isn't. I gave it as much of a chance that I could, but once it got to the scene where Nadia the exchange student is undressing on the webcam and pleasuring herself on that dude's bed my suspension of disbelief just couldn't hold out any longer and I shut it off.<br />Look, you can have gross-out scenes and sophomoric sight gags in a comedy all you want so long as you balance it with some smarts in the script-writing. Too much barf and not enough bite. Pass.
B00005BCOK|4.0|\\"Westworld\\" was Michael Crichton's first theatrical film as a director and it sounds a theme that is found in many of his novels and films, to wit, the mistake of humanity relying on machines rather on themselves (e.g., \\"The Andromeda Strain,\\" \\"The Terminal Man,\\" \\"Jurassic Park\\").  However, the film starts off at the other end of the spectrum as two best buds, Peter Martin (Richard Benjamin) and John Blaine James Brolin), head for Delos, an \\"amusement\\" part where all of the people and animals are robots.  The amusements are strictly oriented towards the male of the species, who get to choose between Roman World, Medieval World, and Westworld.  Peter and John pick the last one, obviously, and spend their days out-drawing the local robot gunslinger (Yul Brynner) and \\"seducing\\" the gals at the saloon.  Clearly this is just the concept of home appliances taken to a new level, all in the name of harmless recreation.  Then, of course, something goes terribly wrong.<br />You really do not want to get more into the technological explanation for why the robots turn on their human masters, because one of the commonplaces of these sort of stories is that those who tamper with nature or create some other afforntery to human dignitiy through technology are always smart enough to do something like create robots (or clone dinosaurs) but still stupid enough not to build in simple safeguards (ask me how to build a safe Jurassic Park someday).  The motivation for our willing suspension of disbelief for this logic of this film comes not from our understanding of robotics, but rather from the glint in Yul Brynner's eye when the rules for the game are suddenly changed in his favor.<br />\\"Westworld\\" is not really a horror film because our sympathies are never really with Peter and John, who have shown disdain for the robots in their conquests both on the streets and in the bedrooms of Westworld.  Early on there is some nothing of what fun it would be like to be a \\"real\\" cowboy, Roman or knight, but these two clowns are making a lot less of an attempt to be a real cowboy than the guys in \\"City Slickers.\\"  By the time Yul Brynner has become faster on the draw, the tawdry male fantasies of the two male visitors have made them less than human in other eyes.  Not that Westworld is the real West, which Crichton makes clear by having Yul Brynner dressed just like his character in the classic Hollywood Western \\"The Magnificent Seven,\\" but Peter and John clearly have no respect for anything beyond their bloated self-concepts.<br />Crichton's direction is certainly competent, and the chase sequence creates some nice suspense (especailly since we are not really rooting for the humans by this point).  Brynner's performance is mesmerizing, especially once he gets that gleam in his eyes and goes after the boys (think of him as the \\"Terminator\\" of his generation).  Three years after \\"Westworld\\" a tacky sequel, \\"Futureworld\\" was produced, retreading the original in a different setting.  \\"Westworld\\" was one of the biggest science fiction box office successes in the dark days before \\"Star Wars,\\" which is even more impressing considering the film was made for a little more than $1 million.r knight, but these two clowns are making a lot less of an attempt to be a real cowboy than the guys in \\"City Slickers.\\"  By the time Yul Brynner has become faster on the draw, the tawdry male fantasies of the two male visitors have made them less than human in other eyes.

B00006JIA4|4.0|Good buy, but like other Queen \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilations this disc doesn't have their '70s FM hits like \\"Spread Your Wings\\" and \\"'39\\", and features glaring omissions of \\"Love Of My Life\\", \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" and \\"Get Down, Make Love\\". Those songs are what Queen should be remembered by and what made Queen famous, rather than afterthoughts like \\"Body Language\\" and \\"The Invisible Man\\" (included here).  It is ridiculous that so many key tracks are omitted in a 3-CD set.  None of the songs here are bad, but they're not necessarily the ones that gave Queen such a following.  Young fans won't fully \\"get it\\" with this compilation.  The wait for a comprehensive package continues.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This band is perty damn funny.  The music is so good you'll want to sing it out loud, but can't in public because of the lyrics.  The skits between the songs get a bit boring after awhile, but they're fresh for the first few listens.  Soon you'll be skipping to the songs, though, which are classic, and generate great rock-and-roll emotions in the listener.  I can't wait for their next album.

This album is absolutely perfect. From former reviews of mine you can see that I hand out 5's a lot, therefore making this 5 a bit of an understatement. I think I'll give it a Seven... an Eight. A Ten. Ten stars for a gorgeous CD worth spending the high amount CDs are sold nowadays, and not just downloading and burning.<br />I could go song by song, explaining how each one touched me, but I'd rather not bore you with such words.<br />The followup single for &quot;In My Place&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot;, is probably the only song on the album I don't like as much as the rest. Even though it ended up being a favourite song by most, I found it to be a bit dull. It lacks a peak point. Nonetheless, it's not as if skipping track 4 is difficult.<br />Just to show you nothing's perfect.<br />Well, except for 90% of this album.
B000070WJE|5.0|Robbie's brand spanking new album, Escapology, is simply amazing. A brilliant blend of rock and pop, mixing old Robbie flavas with brave new ones. As always Robbie's tunes are heart felt and sung with brutal honesty. \\"Come Undone\\" is catchy, witty and full of robbisms! While \\" sexed up\\" is a beautiful ballad that provokes emotion even in the steel-hearted. If you liked Robbie's other work, especially I've Been Expecting You then this is for you. If you didn't then this album cannot fail to convert you into a true Robbie fan.
6305508550|2.0|As a movie about the absurdities of cubicle-life (especially in software companies), this movie might resonate a bit better with software engineers, but in general it was a big disappointment.  <br />Plain and simple Office Space should be lot sharper and funnier than it is. <BR>The subject of office life is loaded with opportunities for truly funny comedy, but this movie only generated a few laughs (usually of the wry, snickering, `who-does-that-remind-you-of' kind).  Most of the stuff you've seen before, and even 9-to-5 did a better job of it.   <BR>Stephen Root, a truly superb comic actor from `NewsRadio', is unrecognizable here in both physical appearance and talent.  <BR>Jennifer Aniston is equally wasted, so badly that I thought surely this film must have been made before she became a star (wrong, OfficeSpace was made AFTER her success on Friends; can't understand why she agreed to be in such a mediocre flick).  <BR>The only saving grace was the always excellent Deitrich Bader (from The Drew Carey Show), but even he couldn't save the worn jokes or the meandering plot.   <br />I saw this movie when it was shown at work (yeah, some companies have a sense of humor about themselves), so I can say it's better than working, but I sure wouldn't pay to see it or rent it.  You'll get more laughs out of a week of Dilbert cartoons.

B00000AD94|5.0|Just when I thought that prog rock was dead, along comes Spock's Beard with this awesome, at times off the wall, CD.  Being in my 40's, I grew up with the great prog rock giants of the 70's (ELP, Yes, Genesis, etc...), and have only been mildly amused at the bands since then that have incorporated prog-rock 'musings' into their sound.  It is great to hear a respectful nod to the past, with an infusion of pop to make what some consider a dead art into a living and breathing thing again.<br />Thanks, Neil, for keeping the dream alive and not skating into oblivion with the 'flavor of the day' when it comes to 'todays music'.  SB stuck to their guns, and made a classic prog rock CD that will have this diehard fan pulling it out on a regular basis.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage's debut album is absolutely mindblowing! This is their best album and i think one of the best rock/metal albums of all time. With Zack's rapping, raging political messages blasting out over Morello's amazing, gripping metal guitar riffs and the funky bass lines of Timmy.C with the great drumming of Brad Wilk put into the equation,it creates a fantastic mix of funk, metal,punk,hardcore and hiphop. Every song is great and very memorable in it's own way but i think the best songs on the album are: freedom,bombtrack and bullet in the head.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Surprisingly, this is one of the best of the pop albums that came from the batch of pop singers in that year (NSync, Backstreet Boys, Jessica Simpson, ext).  The chorus are pretty catchy.  The only bad songs here are: Dear Diary,When Your Eyes Say It, and Don't Go knockin on my door.  I know her voice isn't great, but in here she shines.  The other albums (Baby One More Time and Britney) never quite match up to this one.
B00005RHGK|3.0|I heard alot about this movie before it cme out, so I watched it as soon as it came out on video. Like I know some people have already said the first 1/2 hour or so is great! Really chilling. Then you get the [stuff] about that psychic old lady and the \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" song. I really think that should have been chopped out.<BR>Then you acctually see the monster. OH MI FREAKING GOD! Its so [bad]! They should have just kept it covered up, and not let eople see it.  THAT would have given it a more creepy sence. Instead you get to see the most unbelivable FLYING monster ever.<BR>Rent it, dont buy it. Watch it though, if just for the first 1/2 hour.
B00006CXXU|4.0|After hearing this cd a couple of times, I must admit it is an improvement from her first one.  There are great songs in this album.  The only one I truly dislike is &quot;Keep Singin' my song&quot;.  It's way too boring.(Seems I'm one of the few people who liked &quot;Dirrty&quot; with Redman.).  Also, I'm not too fond of the interludes.  All in all a great work.  One on the best pop cd's of 2002.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars.
0783244320|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies I have seen.  It is ranked in the top 10.  Overall it is about 5 actors and a actor roadie (who is tagging along for the fun of it) who are mistaken, by aliens, for their characters they play in the hit tv series 'Galexy Quest'.<BR>I 100% assure you that you will love the movie.  Well, enjoy!!!
630289915X|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life is a very special film.  Meticulously and perfectly structured, it tells of a seemingly simple story of a small-town banker - his life and tribulations.  Part of the time, it is comedy and romance, and it turns dark and melodramatic in the middle.  The storytelling is never straightforward - it starts out with narrations from the third party with flashbacks before getting to the present.  When the angel intervenes, the story takes a turn to the surreal.  James Stewart is perfect in the role of George Bailey, with a wide range of emotions.  Watch him closely in the scenes at the bridge and after running out of his mother's boarding house.  The entire cast, the script, and the direction that weaves through many layers of details are flawless.  The cynics might slight the feel-good, homely happy ending, but overall, this film should rank among the best in its era just for its artistic merits.
B00006LFGD|4.0|I agree with just about everyone else on here: enough with the recycled packaged hits. Two best of collections in a year--that's a bit much.<br />But, this cd is great. It showcases the wonderful voice and the precision that Streisand has as a singer; no other vocalist can match her.<br />I think a CD of b-sides is a great idea. And maybe a collection of Streisand singing some great jazz standards a la Joni Mitchell or Diana Krall. And whatever happened to that CD of songs from movies she mentioned in her One Voice concert?<br />I only hope she continues to put new recordings out there!
B00005RY7X|5.0|this album is a rock album in the purest form. i'm hearing lots of 'is this guy for real?' after listening to this album countless times, seeing him live and talking to him, i must say [heck] YEAH this guy is for real![.] If you can listen to 'she is beautiful' or 'party hard' or 'i get wet' without atleast AT LEAST getting a smile on your face you seriously need to cool it since you forgot how to have fun. This is not a joke and it's not silly or dumb. This is primal, elemental, straight forward, simple rock and if you scoff at simple music think of the Ramones who are one of the most influintial rock bands of all time with 1-2-3-GO... and 3 chords. This album has limitless replay value, I've had it for almost a year and it's still one of my favorites and his shows are out of this world with so much energy.<BR>If you want a gritty, primal, fun album by all means get this.<BR>If not, get it and try to have fun.<BR>(By the way, I am starting a campaign to replace good-bye with PARTY HARD!...)<br />so PARTY HARD!...
B00003CXCW|3.0|Long awaited, much anticipated, Sunset Boulevard rises on DVD, for a whole new generation to marvel and wonder. Billy Wilder's classic film, dark comedy, sad social commentary on how the Hollywood machine eats up people  without thought, looks impressive in this format. However, the DVD ultimately disappoints by offering a smattering of bonus features not worthy of this piece of cinema.<br />Telling the story of a deranged, May-December romance between a has-been movie star and a hack writer, Sunset Boulevard was one of the first films to bite the hand that was feeding it, and left a gaping wound in the process.<br />As Glenn Close firmly states, Norma Desmond is one of the best drawn characters in human history. She is comic, tragic, melodramatic, and ultimately insane, a depth of a role any actress should have eaten up. But, it's Gloria Swanson's shining moment on the screen. Her command of the role, her subtle insanity, is the mark of a masterful actor at work. Who tires of watching her famous staircase decent, her decent into delusion?<br />William Holden also nails his role. Without him, this film would be off kilter and unbelievable. He's asked to play a struggling writer, a lover, and a sarcastic wiseguy through this picture. Much credit should go to him, and Erich von Stroheim, for tour de force performances.<br />While the film holds up extremely well, the DVD 's bonus features are somewhat lacking. The documentary, while revealing, is somewhat short. The best part of it was hearing the reflections of Nancy Olson, even more beautiful now than she was in the film. The additional commentary, by Billy Wilder historian Ed Sikov, is sporadic. When he does speak, he does illuminate certain features, but not nearly enough. Perhaps a better choice would have been Sam Staggs who wrote the definitive book on this movie, \\"Close-up on Sunset Boulevard\\". And why wasn't Nancy Olson included on the commentary? Certainly she would have much to add about the making of this movie.<br />The film easily scores a five star rating, they don't get much better than this. The DVD brings it to a three star rating, but don't be swayed. If you are a fan of the movie, the DVD certainly must be added to your collection. If you are not, rent the DVD and enjoy, and pity, the tragic life of Norma Desmond, created by a Hollywood system gone wacky, which, I'm afraid, hasn't changed all that much.movie.<br />The film easily scores a five star rating, they don't get much better than this.

B000021YQV|2.0|If you're as bummed out about the state of metal today as I am, then this album will give you a little hope.  Most metal today is just a showcase for morons who don't know how to play their instruments or sing - if you can call the howling and growling of today an attempt at singing.  Ironically, it is very similar to the  state of metal when losers like Poison were popular, except everything now is ultra-heavy instead of sugary-sweet.<br />Anyway, SOAD actually is able to craft some songs that are heavy, yet intricate and skillfull.  If you've heard \\"Arials\\", then you've heard the best song on the album.  There are 3 or 4 others that are good, too, unfortunately there is just too much thrash and not enough skill.  The saving grace is the singer, he has a unique voice that stands out from the crowd and actually is singing (although he howls a bit on the first song, but its the only one).  The guitar work is mediocre, mostly thrash with an occasional melody thrown in.  Drumming is standard metal, not a drum machine but not exactly Tool either.<br />If you're a fan of todays metal then you might be turned off by the attempt at real melody and good singing.  But if you're waiting for another Tool, then this may be too hard for you.  It inhabits the uncomfortable middle ground between pure agression and aggressive music.  With a little improvement in musicallity, System could become the Metallica of the 2000's - and not the Metallica of \\"Unload\\", but the Metallica of \\"Master of Puppets\\".  The question is, are they afraid of being labeled sellouts like Metallica if they try to change?<br />My Rating:<BR>**    <br />My Scale:<BR>*     Weak, maybe 1 or two good songs, lots of filler<BR>**    OK, throw it in the car or MP3 player for long trips<BR>***   Good, several excellent songs, still needs some work<BR>****  Excellent, a classic that I will listen too for years to come.<BR>***** Awesome.  The entire world will be talking about this album for the next 10 years.

630026999X|1.0|They  say  horror  movies  are  a  test  of  your  wits  and  your  endurance .... and  this  movie  does  that .... but  not  in  the  way  they  may  have  intended  it  to  be . The  acting  is  so  diabolical  you  begin  to  wonder  why  the  hell  did  you  put  your  money  to  waste  on  a  movie  like  this . The  acting  is  so  hilariously  bad  that  when  friends  and  family  interrupt  and  start  talking  about &quot; think  I  ought  to  mow  the  lawn  tomorrow , what  do  you  think  dear &quot; you  gladly  give  your  opinion  just  so  you  can  get  away  from  the  terrible  film . <br />Now  when  you  think  of  a  George  Romero  film  you  think &quot; Oh  this  might  be  good &quot; because  of  such  classics  as  The  Living  Dead  trilogy  and  Code  Name  Trixie ( The  Crazies  to  you  and  me ) and  the  amiable  Bruiser . But  then  this  just  really  tears  your  heart  out . Again  I  go  back  to  the  acting  and  how  poor  it  is  but  you've  just  got  to  see  it  to  believe  it . I  mean  how  do  these &quot; actors &quot; ( I  use  the  term  loosely ) sleep  at  night  knowing  they  made  a  turkey  like  this . Actually  I'm  being  cruel - turkeys  have  better  taste  than  to  watch  this  tripe<br />Avoid  at  all  costs - Please  I  beg  you  don't  submit  yourself  to  this  torture
B00001ODHJ|5.0|Ahh-ha-ha-ha, just when you thought it was over, director Sam Raimi, irreplaceable star Bruce Campbell, an' the dreaded Book of the Dead came back one mo' gin for a exciting, hilarious an' \\"groovy\\" sword-and-sorcery epic filled with over-the-top action an' hard-to-resist one-liners. I mean, c'mon now, anybody whose seen the essential original 'Evil Dead' an' the far superior 'Evil Dead 2' should know that the third installment would hafta be somethin' bizarre an' really outta this world. Well, trust me, it is all'a those things an' a bag'a chips, an' if you ain't seen it, brace yourself.<br />For one thing you got Bruce Campbell, who reprises his role as Ash, the shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed department store clerk from S-Mart's housewares division. Having been time-warped to medieval England, he is believed by King Arthur an' the men an' women of the villages to be the chosen one, sent from the sky to help rid them of the hideous \\"deadites\\". When he screws up the initial (an' much safer) plan to legitimately remove the Necronomicon from the cemetary deep in the woods, he ends up unleashing an army of skeletons, all resurrected from their tombs an' led by \\"Evil Ash\\", his polar opposite, who makes a triumphant return after making a brief appearance in 'Evil Dead 2' as his reflection in the mirror. Yeah, alright, I know it sounds weird, but, damn, get into it a lil' bit, will 'ya? <br />If there's one series of films that wouldn't be anything without its main star it's the 'Evil Dead' movies. By the third time around, Bruce Campbell should know he's become entrenched in the role of Ash, and all his cheesy macho heroism too. Nobody, but NOBODY could deliver these lines with such gall an' such bad-a$$ appeal like he does. I mean, alright, check this out. I'm 'bout to give you an example of jus' how damn cool this movie really is, so pay attention.<br />When \\"Evil Ash\\" first appears, after completely splitting off from Ash's body, they come face-to-face in the woods. \\"Evil Ash\\" begins mocking his counterpart, calling him \\"Goody-little two shoes, goody-little two shoes...\\" an' slapping him around like a punk. Ash stands there putting up with it for a few seconds, an' you're probably thinkin', I know he ain't gon' let this fool do him like 'at, right? Then outta nowhere he holds up the double-barrelled sawed-off shotgun an' presses it into \\"Evil Ash\\"'s face which in an instance turns pale, then blows him to kingdom come. As smoke curls outta the gun barrel, Ash looks at the corpse an' says \\"Good... bad... I'm the guy with the gun.\\"<br />Good God Almighty, that is the BEST an' most knowingly CHEESY line EVER written in the history of cinema! An' I love it! In fact, one complaint I have about the Bootleg Version is that line has been changed to sumpin' much less cool. Speaking of which, my reccomendation to anyone who is a fan'a this movie is to buy the single-disc Anchor Bay edition as well as the Bootleg Director's Cut on DVD, so you can get the full breadth of both visions. The picture quality on the Bootleg Version is not as good, but, hey, thas' why is' called \\"bootleg\\", you primitive screwheads! From an artistic standpoint, I think the director's cut is far superior, as the final battle scene is more broken down into tactical maneauvers from both sides, an' you get to see more of the puppetry with the legions of skeletal warriors. In the theatrical version, the battle scene is jus' kinda splayed at you all at once, an' you can hardly even tell whats' goin' on, an' whose winning. Also, I agree with Bruce Campbell that the original ending is far more appropriate an' was a nice lead-in for the fourth installment if there is to ever be one.<br />Well, to conclude this unholy mess of a review, 'Army of Darkness' is one'a my all-time favorite movies, an' I hope to God that Bruce an' Sam get together to continue Ash's zombie-killing legacy. Originally, the prospects of making a fourth one looked pretty bleak, since 'Army of Darkness' flopped at the box-office, an' the studios refused to greenlight another 'Evil Dead' movie. But, with all the fanfare an' love, not to mention HUGE box-office receipts, Sam Raimi is getting with the 'Spider-Man' movies, an' especially considering the millions of loyal fans the 'Evil Dead' films have gained since '93, he may have the final say. An' the talk that I'm hearin', is that after he completes the next 'Spider-Man' movie, they may begin work on another 'Evil Dead'. Let's hope so. But now I'm wonderin' with two completely different endings to 'Army of Darkness' planted in people's minds, which one would they follow up on? I guess we'll hafta wait an' see if it happens.
B000075BFK|5.0|This cd is better than 99% of the stuff out there today' It has everything from his raw stuff like 'When We Ride on Our Enemies''. To the soft 'My Block''. This cd will go over well with any Pac fan'and his soft songs will bring in an even bigger fan base. As for Nas being on the   'Thugz Mansion' track I wish I could be [mad] cause he was on that song, but it's just got a great flow... and if u cant stand him u can listen to the non acoustic version which is just as good if not better'. Overall I loved this cd'.  'As for the where are these songs coming from' 'your best guess would be from his unfinished studio outtakes' from the Editorial Review  any true Pac fan is just thankful his music is still around and we don't care where its coming  from.. Lets just hope it keeps coming!!! This is a must have cd, so go out and get it NOW!!!!!

B00005NGZX|5.0|With their brutal hardcore metal riffs and their scretching black/death/grind vocals Converge, again, makes its mark on music with this masterpiece of heavy music. Combining the whole of the metal genre into a singular piece of music, Converge creates a momentus release with the complexity of math metal mixed with the rage and angst of hardcore. With some of the best vocals and guitar riffs in modern music, \\"Jane Doe\\" blows the listeners away. With the brutal opener \\"Concubine\\", Covnerge shows off their ability to play great music. With \\"Hell to Pay\\", they took a softer and slower approach than normal, but it somes off as a very thought out pattern of doom meets grind. \\"Homewrecker\\", my personal favorite track, is a sonic approach at all that is heavy and evil. Loud and fast as hell. \\"Phoenix in Flight\\" and \\"Phoenix in Flames\\" are both amazing tracks that show off the technical side of Converge. The closer, \\"Jane Doe\\", is my second favorite track. With its perfected musical approach and the vocal assault it truely shows mastery of the genre. \\"Jane Doe\\" is an amazing album that should be purchased at all costs and listened to as often as possible.

B00005YTFG|1.0|The woeful acting from Kidman is what lost me, not the sets, costumes, singing, editing which I thought were passable. I am yet to watch Nicole Kidman convince me of a character or her ability to act in any movie she has done. To Die For was her other majorly overacted, overrated attempt that springs to mind. Her method is stoic, forced, almost unnatural. Her screen emotions ALWAYS look like they were read from a teleprompter. She needs to let go and cut with what she \\"thinks we want\\" as opposed to letting us see what we want. We NEED to feel it is she who is really crying, dying, laughing, hurting, loving as many wonderful actors are capable of doing. Nicole is just unable to capture my heart or mind in any film she has done. She tries too hard with every line, every look...all heavily exaggerated. A true craftsman should not have to try so hard and when done right it is flawless, effortless and completely natural no matter what the unlikely and corny subject matter (I totally believed Sigourney Weaver was going to kick some Alien ass as Ripley!! Tom Hanks was truly in space making that movie Apollo 13!! For God's sake, I believed the horses in Braveheart were really killed they did such a great job falling down on cue!!) But I cannot believe Nicole Kidman. Funny thing about the word acting. We know you are acting, but we don't want to feel anything other than what we are seeing could be real and true. We simply do not want to see the mechanics of human acting such as emotion and voice training. She is so methodical in her delivery, it is like she is practising pulling faces and lines in front of the mirror.<br />I am sure she is a lovely person and great Mum to her kids with many other talents to take on the world with.....but she is not an actor. Moulin Rouge is lost in the tragic trash category in my opinion because of her.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I am sure that I wont be saying anything new here, but i do feel i must give my own 2 cents worth. Band of Brothers is the most stunning and realistic piece of war movie i have eevr seen, it is obvious since Tom Hanks' role in Saving Private Ryan, that he has been deepply moved by his role in it, and he has desires to show more about what WWII was about. I have a profound and deep appreciatin for the men of the armed forces that fought for us in WWII, their selfless and heroic acts are too numerous to mention, they have done so much for us, and provided our country today with the heritage it now has, and us young twenty somehtings are riding on the coattalis of that and taking it for granted and the security we have. Band Of Brothers gives an amazingly accurate portrayel at what the war would have been like, let's face it, war is not a job any normal, sane person would want to do, and it isnt pleasant by any means, and these men did what many thought impossible. Band of Brothers shows how ugly war can be for both sides, and how much it can affect our lives.<BR>The work done by all the actors was superb, their acting ability was incredible, and they have done very well at capturiong the ugly pain that war inflicts on anyone close enough to it. The movie is terrific, accurate to no end, and the men in it are truly heroes. I had a chance to meet with a veteran of WWII and i got to talk to him briefly about his various tours of duty and the work he did, he had many medals, and was active in many wars after that, he wasnt a warmonger, or one who wanted to kill, he was amazingly gentle, and yet he had fought many times, in WWII, korea, and Vietnam, and his tales were closely matched to what Band Of Brothers portrayed, a grand thank you to all the men and women who has kept our country safe from tyranny, both past and present<BR>A very large tahnk you as well to Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg who have worked hard at keeping the memory ofd this horrific event from fading away, thanks again to everyone who made this movie possilb,e it is greta, your money wont be wasted

6304806418|2.0|This is one of or if not Madonna's most boring and uniteresting films that she has ever done.  The film had high expectations and the first night it was released in theaters the place was packed.  By the second half of the film more than half the audience was asleep.  I was getting pretty bored myself.  I think this is a lacklustre movie and a waste of money.  The entire film is nothing but song and at the very end there is finally some dialogue.  That was the dialogue that won Madonna an accolade.  If you must see this film expect to yaaaaawn all the way!

It is one of the \\"Dover Thrift Editions,\\" which reprints classics for between $1.00-$1.50, so we have no excuse for not being literate and culture.  This book, however, has the feel of a pricier classic.  The cover is tasteful and evocative of yuletide.  The typesetting and printing is high quality.  I have never seen any faint ink, or skipped words, or typos in any of Dover's publications.<br />But any book is about the story, and not the format.  This story of human redemption is deservedly a classic.  People can change, and anyone can improve, and that is the message of the season.<br />Dickens' genius is not only his vivid description, but also his thought compression.  It is only 68 pages long, so it can be read in one setting.  I try to do thins, since the story has greater force if it is swallowed whole, without any commercial breaks.  It is the pinnacle of Christian Fantasy.
B000000HTM|5.0|Well after the issue of this fantastic space and dark album, with a lot of reverberations, great organ lines by Banton (this musician supporting the exceptional performance of Peter HAMMIL together with Jackson's sax, close to some experimental Canterbury),they settled the definitive style togther with Magma, a great reference also for the Neoclassical French school/Zeuhl Music, which found his way after publications like these, by giving an improvement in the following decade as long as a new complex style of PROGRESSIVE MUSIC took shape (Univers Zero, Dun and sometimes After Crying and Minimum Vital in their dark moments as well).Afterwards the experimental prog bands brought something special in the progressive field by means of their fresh ideas.<BR>Coming back to this work by V.D.G.G., I like to remark the importance of the incredible final suite &quot;Plague of Lighthouse Keepers...&quot;, which is one of the most original and influential of the last 30 years, this being one of the best prog pages of all time!!<br />Highly recommended, not only for the lovers of dark prog music!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I find that life is rather dull in the time between releases of any album that Chris Cornell sings on. Whenever a Soundgarden one popped up -- whew! RELIEF! JOY! Even his solo album gave me strength and peace of mind. Because every other artist and every other musical gimmick of the day is just not delivering the goods. <BR>Now that AUDIOSLAVE is out, I'm jolted back to life and jamming to an album I can honestly say that there may not be a bad song on it. Every now and then I miss some of the guitar work of Soundgarden -- the Rage guitarist is loud and good but just not quite as &quot;special&quot; in tone as perhaps Kim was able to paint for us. But on the whole -- I'd have to say Thank God for Audioslave! I highly recommend it.
B00005UW7V|4.0|I first watched this movie right when it came out on tape and I was shocked.  The storyline follows a robotic boy.  The company that creates the robotic boys tells the family, before their purchase, that if they ever decide they don't want the boy, he will have to be destroyed.  The mechanical children are hard wired for one family and one family only.  Well as you can guess the family ends up deciding they don't want the boy.  Instead of doing the humane thing by taking him to be destroyed they abandon him.  This boy spends the entire life of a world trying to become human so his family will love him again.  I must say this movie left me with a disturbed feeling in my stomach an while I didn't like this feeling much I have to respect the movie that caused the emotion.  Spielberg has outdone himself with this movie.  I usually do not like his films but this one is well developed and it makes you think about things.  You know I have heard people say the movie is too long and I don't think so, I thought it moved smoothly.  A great movie for anyone to watch.
B0000027I6|3.0|\\" Man is a hunter. To legislate against his instinct is folly.\\" -R. Waters <br />The instinct of man in his need to perform as a predatory animal can be viewed well beyond that of hunting for the sake of food.  The desire to have more, to take more, and to kill for more can also be viewed from this same precipice. So if legislating against Man's instinct is folly, then what does that leave Roger to rally against?
B00006X06U|5.0|Great new versions of wonderful songs.  It's nice to have an artist that isn't afraid to try something different, especially with her own material.  This is especially rare today.  <BR>Keep up the great work Joni.<br />A fan since 1974.
B00007E8V4|4.0|Txicity had all filler songs this cd has more longer and thoughtfull songs, more like the self titled. If any body tries to copy these guys, u wont succeed.
B000002I53|5.0|I bought my first copy of this when it came out and played it on a portable record player living in a rooming house in Minneapolis. It floored me then and it floors me still 42 years later. I've listened to it hundreds of times (and on better and better sound systems) over the years and I always play it straight through. It is perfection and can be listened to softly or full tilt. I prefer full tilt.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Dont listen to magazine critcs take it from a fan like me, this cd is way better than all that you cant leave behind.
B000002ADT|5.0|Yes, I insist, this is the Best Jazz Album Of All Time. You have Miles Davis, the best Trumpet player since Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, arguably the best Tenor Sax player ever, Bill Evans, the best Piano player since Thelonius Monk, Cannonball Adderly, one of the best Alto sax players since Charlie Parker, Jimmie Cobb and Paul Chambers, one of the best rhythm sections ever. All of these extraordinary musicians are at their peak improvising original music in an emerging post-bop idiom. What you have here is so fresh and beautiful you will be enjoying it for the next forty years as I have been for the past forty years.
B000002HRE|5.0|My favortite metallica album, has my favorite solos, lyrics, and Metallica is on the cover why wouldnt u want it. The solos are amazing and thoughtfull on this cd, Kirk Hammett is GOD.
B000000Y2F|5.0|Here you have Monk at the peak of his Genius and Coltrane coming into his own. These sessions with Monk no doubt prepared Coltrane for the extraordinary work he would soon do with Miles Davis. And then the Genius he established with his own quartet.<br />This album is on my all time best list. The only question is how do you file it: Under Monk or Coltrane.
B000002HMH|5.0|Every metallica album kix ..., every metallica song kix ..., they are masters of freaking out there fans with something totally new and different, I love it.
B000070WJE|1.0|...the one on the album cover I mean. Musically this man couldn't escape out of a paper bag. At least his clinky little tunes used to have the power to nauseate, notably Rock DJ. His new album, whilst less offensive than the previous two is only so because of its uniform blandness. It is to your lasting credit America that you give the third most/least talented member of dire boy band Take That the short shrift he deserves. Britney looks like Patti Smith next to this plonker.
B000063DHK|5.0|I have Maiden in Rio, Maiden in Japan, A real dead/live and Live after Death. The last one is the best of all, and the Slavery tour was the biggest of all the Iron Maiden tours, here we are appreciating Maiden in is peak of its popularity.<BR>I specially like Ace High, Revelations and the Rime of the ancient mariner is a pitty that they do not play those song anymore.
B00001QEBQ|4.0|This is definatly a good Disney that deserves to be remembered. It doesn't follow the traditional story-line of Disney movies. It is new and creative. It ditches the romance and features a female heroine that actually is a hero. She saves China! Another thing is, this is the only animated movie my 11-year-old brother likes. Quite an accomplishment. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because it lacks the traditional music that all Disney movies posses. There are some songs but they aren't very memorable. But, overall, this is a wonderful Disney film that should be treasured for many years to come.
0792844890|5.0|After being a Spaceballs fan for so many years, this DVD was a treat.  Especially a treat is seeing the movie with Mel Brooks's comments as voiceover.  Who knew that the &quot;planet&quot; where the Winnebago crash-landed was actually done in Yuma, Arizona?  All in all, a great buy, and very much worth it over the VHS version.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Besides Nirvana,At the drive in is probably my second favorite band of all time.Everything fits together perfectly on this albulm.The lyrics are the most amazing peices of art since nirvana.I also like At the Drive in's underground appeal as well.I dont know if i would call this punk,alternative,or anything.But the main idea is that its an excellent cd.Im sorta disappointed that they broke up,but Sparta and Mars volta are pretty good too.Yes,at the drive in will always have a special in my harddrive.
