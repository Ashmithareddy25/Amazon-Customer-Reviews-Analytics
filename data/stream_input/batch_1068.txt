B001EN71DG|5.0|Not having looked at other reviews I'd wager that everything that can be said has been said.    This is the best trilogy of all time.  A modern American myth that borrows elements from many different genres to create an original piece of art.  Watch these three and then, if you're like me, check out the prequels, the novels, the games, the comics, the television shows, etc.  I can't get enough of the Star Wars galaxy, thank you George Lucas!
B0042JTDXK|4.0|If you listen to Illuminations after not having listened to Josh Grobin for some time, you might think his new work is a departure from his earlier music. If you plop it in your five disc changer along with all of his earlier CDs you can get that Illuminations is a logical evolutionary move for him. The more \\"operatic\\" songs connect the CD to his earlier CDs. The more contemporary songs take his work in a bit of a new direction, but also provide a connection to the contemporary songs on his earlier CD.     To become and remain successful, artists must remain faithful to their art, their niche in the music kingdom, the listeners who underwrite their success. They must also remain fresh, re-invent themselves, renew themselves, continue to grow, without devolving into charicatures of the themselves or, worse, another artist. Listening to an artist's new work should make you want to listen again to his earlier stuff - with new ears.     Josh Grobin is a great young artist. He has, thankfully, a long career ahead of him. As long as he continues to explore his talents as a singer, song-writer, producer, pianist, percussionist, actor, artist, genuinely nice young man, we will be able to look forward always to his next work and know that it will refresh our appreciation of his past accomplishments as well.
B002ZG999U|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I was happy to see Arnold Schwarzenegger back where he belongs: In film.  Sylvester Stalone looked pretty fit for a guy who is in his sixties.  I liked the fact that all of the major action stars in modern film were in this movie from Jason Stathom, Bruce Willis, Terry Crews, Jet Li, and Mickey Rourke.  All of these men made a great combination for a movie and I hope they get together again for another film.  Hopefully, Arnold will finally be out of office by then.  Overall, this movie not only had a great set of actors, but it also had great fight scenes and explosive action sequences that kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie.  If they make a sequel, I am definitely seeing it.

044654759X|3.0|There used to be a day I'd greet each new Nicholas Sparks book with excitement and an eager desire to put everything else aside until I'd read the book in its entirety.  Then a pattern began to emerge, leading up to my current feelings of quiet acceptance that, yes - the story would be engrossing and yes, I'd cry, but there was no hurry to get through it.  This led me to the decision to listen to Safe Haven on audio during a long car trip to and from my folks house for the holiday.<br /><br />In some ways, I appreciated the book more this way.  The story took longer to unfold and I felt less rushed to get to the \\"crying\\" parts of the book, but also, it showed some glaringly slow parts.  I liked the characters of Alex and Katie, but found their interaction to be a little cliche.  There were some pretty tired jokes made and the dialogue wasn't as witty as I remembered Sparks being.. all in all it felt just a bit transparent, which disappointed me since I loved the relationship in, for example, The Notebook.<br /><br />Overall, Safe Haven is a worthy addition to Sparks' list of books, but not one of my favorites.  I wouldn't recommend the audio, even sitting in a car for 12 hours wasn't enough to keep my interest going at times and I found myself drifting off to sleep, or switching over to listen to music. I think I would have enjoyed the book more had I actually read it.
0525951652|4.0|The first of a promised trilogy.  Focus is on the early 1900s detailing a vast array of characters affected by the coming Great War (WWI) which helps along the process of women's suffrage, trade unions, topples nobility and the rise of the Bolsheviks in Mother Russia.  WWI focus is less on the battles and more on the suffering.  The very end of this 1000 page tale shows the aftermath of the war and the ominous foreboding of another World War to come. TRIVIA: Woodrow Wilson was the first president to leave the U.S. on official business according to the book but Wiki claims it was Theodore Roosevelt.  CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOT POINTS: B; SETTING: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN READ: September to November.
0545128285|5.0|Instead of giving the overall book a review, I'll review each story separately.     The Wizard and the Hopping Pot: 5 out of 5. This is because it's a very enjoyable tale about a cold-hearted wizard who learns his lesson. The references to Harry Potter are also enjoyable. To quote the editorial long review of the 5 tales on Amazon, \\"the kindly old wizard at the beginning of this tale reminds us of Dumbledore quite a bit.\\" Dumbledore's commentary (a nice touch) is hilarious because of the sugar-coated fictional version of this story presented at the end of it. I loved how it said that Hermione Granger translated this book. It made it seem more of an authentic wizard's story book.     The Fountain of Fair Fortune: 5.1 out of 5. This tale, in my opinion, may win the prize for the best written down fairy tale of all time. J.K. Rowling's beautiful illustrations to it are a treat to look at. The tale itself is well written, like all of them, and its characters are very real. It really makes the task of climbing up the hill to the Fountain seem extremely hard. I loved the ending, too. It was very unexpected. Dumbledore's commentary is at its highest point here, describing the catastrophic attempt to put the play on at Hogwarts. It's also interesting having one of the Malfoys complain about the story.    The Warlock's Hairy Heart: 4.5 out of 5. This particular tale is a bit more gruesome than the others. It should not be read to the easily frightened. It depicts a warlock who thinks that falling in love makes people act foolishly. He finds a way to prevent himself from falling in love, but after meeting a talented and rich witch, his mind might not stay the same. The rest of the tale I'll let you read. It also has frightening illustrations, once again, like all the other illustrations in the book, drawn by J.K. Rowling. She is a very talented illustrator; it's very difficult to draw a human heart accurately, and she pulls it off.     Babbitty Rabbity and Her Cackling Stump:4.9 out of 5. An award should go to this one for having the funniest title. The story here is that our amazingly smart fairy tale king orders the execution of all wizards and witches and then orders a wizard to be his personal wizard despite the previous order. After hiring a fraud, it seems like this charlatan can pull it off, until a poor washer woman named Babbity cackles, leaving the king impatient to learn magic and a very bad situation for the charlatan. Dumbledore's commentary on form-changing wizards makes one think.    The Tale of the Three Brothers: 5 out of 5. This story I won't bother giving part of the plot away, since anyone can either read Harry Potter 7 to see it, or hear it in the movie. It's a very interesting tale though, and Dumbledore's commentary is riveting. It offers a new history to the Elder Wand.     My overall rating of the book is a ......     4.987987 ..... out of 5. This book adds the perfect finish to the Harry Potter series!!!
B0044XV3QY|1.0|I can't comment as other have on the movie since I haven't been able to watch it yet. The problem is definitely with the discs (or, perhaps the player). I've had two different copies of it and both had the same problem. I have tried them on 2 different BluRay players, both Sony's, one an S370 and the other an S570. Both have all of the latest firmware and neither is over a month old.<br />With both machines it takes nearly a minute for anything to show up on the screen. And then it's a message about the disc being made with the latest tech. Eventually that screen disappears and the screen is black. At this point you're likely to give up, but if you leave it alone for a couple of minutes you'll eventually get the opening logo.<br />Basically it just takes too long for anything to happen, not just at the beginning but any time you select from the main menu.<br />I cannot recommend this release to anyone. In fact I urge you not to buy it until such time as the studio apologizes for treating their customers so badly and send out a fixed version.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The final Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, is an adaptation of the darkest book in the series. It only makes sense that the film is also going to be the darkest of its series. Harry Potter 7 was felt by the production crew to be so complex, despite not being the longest book in the series, that they reached a decision to split the film into two parts. So far, the first part, despite being out for only 8 days, has grossed about $400M. Now, onto the actual review! Im spite of the decision to split the film into two parts, everything still couldn't be included. It's best to judge it only as a movie, like the others, rather than as an adaptation of the book. My rating of the movie is 5 out of 5 stars. One of the reasons is that the characters have greatly developed from what they once were. Character development is always very important to anything that has characters, and no character development usually makes you not care about the characters at all! An example of this is Severus Snape. In the first two books and movies, Snape is purely hateable. There is a bit of humor behind the fact that Snape is so detestable. For instance, Snape makes up new rules just to have an excuse to take points off Gryffindor. In the third book and movie, it shows that Snape wasn't always to blame though. One time, he was almost killed, as a prank. In the fourth, it's shown that Snape is a spy for Dumbledore. In The Order of the Phoenix, despite the fact that Snape is even worse to Harry than usual, without him Harry would be in a much worse predicament than he was, at the end of the book (and film). In the sixth one, it's very obvious that he's evil. For those who haven't read the book, I won't spoil it, however Snape is still more complex than good or bad. Another example of character development is the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. My final example is how Dobby came from being a miserable house elf who usually got Harry injured in his attempts to help him, to a worker at Hogwarts. Dobby then strives to return the favor. Another reason this film merits a 5-star rating is the little touches added to the adaptation. For instance, the scene with Harry and Hermione dancing, after Ron leaves. Another such touch is the animation going with The Tale of the Three Brothers, when it is read aloud by Hermione. The film ended perfectly, leaving you wanting more. Nevertheless, it's very aggravating that we'll have to wait about 7 months to see the next one! In my opinion, the film was made stronger by introducing the Hallows themselves in this first act, rather than squeezing them into the second and making it look like an afterthought. The acting, for the next example of the film's rating, is superlative and stupendous. Every single person was perfect for their role and, if I were the director, I would not cast anyone else. The visuals are also great, ranging from black gloominess to a busy ministry to nice beaches and to snowy forests. These are only a few reasons why I think Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows earns a 5-star rating.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Okay, never mind that you've seen the plot before; this is a fun,action filled movie that at times had me gripping my husband's hands tight enough to hurt. The premise is almost cliche, although it is loosely based on an actual incident. Due to the incompetence of two railyard workers, a train carrying toxic materials takes off without an engineer and heads for a densely populated area of Pennsylvania. If not stopped, it could kill tens of thousands of people.    The two main characters are played very ably by Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. Washington plays an experienced conductor who has been pink-slipped by the RR company. Pine plays a brash young, newly trained conductor who still has a lot to learn, and he doesn't actually appreciate Washington's character pointing it out every time he goofs up.    Okay, forget that you know the two characters will develop a mutual respect and work together to heroically stop the runaway train, thereby saving Washington's job with the RR company. This is a fun movie to watch and the suspense is palpable. Nor does it pull all the expected cliche strings- it does miss a few here and there. It was a fun movie to watch and even though I knew how it was going to end, the suspense in seeing how, exactly, they stopped the train kept me on the edge of my seat.

B003WTE886|4.0|A great CD. It has a wide variety of music. From very country ( Back To December) to very pop(Speak Now). All the songs are pretty appropriate for all ages, except for maybe \\"Better Than Revenge\\" But all very good definitely worth buying. Best songs on the album . . . Back To December . . . Haunted . . . Mine. For all everyone raves about \\"Sparks Fly\\" I don't like it very much at all. Worth listening to. All her songs are not about boys either. Very Refreshing.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|A fantastic dvd series. A must have for any WW2 buff. The direction they took in this series I liked somewhat better. You got to know the characters on the fly. Instead of building it up over 1 or 2 episodes. Cinematography was top notch as usual. I enjoyed it from start to finish.

B002BWP49C|5.0|YES, I was a late bloomer when I finallydiscovered the Twilight books. I was never one for reading, let alone these sort of books.  I ended up reading all 4 books in two weeks. I have watch the 1st two movies at least 10 times so far.  Its pretty bad that I am starting to know the actors words before they say them in the movies!!  I was also NEVER a big book reader.  I hope that Stephenie Meyer will continue to write more books on these characters from Twilight. (Bella, Edward, Jacob, Alice, Charlie, Renesmea etc...I fell in love with this entire family.  I hope and pray Mrs. Meyer will publish the book called Midnight Sun, Edwards story version. PLEASE!!!!      Stephanie Meyer THANK YOU for being, as far as I am concerned, the VERY BEST Author and story teller around. When I read your books I felt as if I was watching the story unfold before my very eyes.  I cound not put the books down.  I found myself reading till well after 3AM and then still not wanting to stop.  I actually cried  when I was done with the last book.  Especially when it said THE END!  Please dont let this be THE END.    I recommed everyone..of any age, I am in my mid 30's and LOVE THESE BOOKS!!  BUY them, read them, watch the movies I know you will enjoy them!!  Read the books first..it makes the movies even better.  Hope you enjoy a much as I have...
B0046JLTCE|5.0|With Ivan Moody's melodic yet hardcore voice, Zoltan Bathory's insane guitar solos, Jason Hook's rhythms, Matt Snell's amazing bass, and Jeremy Spencer's hardcore drums you can not go without buying this special edition box set. Five Finger Death Punch is one of the bands that is quickly rising to the top of the metal charts. This is a great purchase for any hard rock/metal fans out there. This is especially great for collectors. Definetly worth the $16!

0439023521|2.0|Suzanne Collins has created such a stir in the world of young adult lit that I finally felt compelled to read the Hunger Games after one of my most sophisticated of friends recommended it.    The story is tired and unoriginal. While Ms. Collins touches upon very important themes of our day, the characters she creates are one dimensional and fail to achieve the depth necessary to sway readers' hearts. The scrappy tomboy; the lovelorn chivalrous hero; the brutish killing machine; the winner who became the town drunk, victim of his own success; the denizens of the Capitol whom we are led to believe are nothing but a bunch of shallow, self-absorbed fashionistas who have the money, technology, and stomach to maintain the rest of the country in indentured servitude.  The scenario she creates - a postapocalyptic totalitarian government dominating the rest of humanity through... seriously, Reality TV ?? is ludicrous and laughable. Katniss at once playing to the cameras against the horror of children fighting other children to the death is a blatant attempt to tug at the reader's heartstrings but lacking in any emotional substance. It's a cheap thrill that I'm sorry so many readers seemed to have bought into.     Then again, perhaps the Hunger Games is merely emblematic of how much our society has bought into Reality TV. Unfortunately, this does nothing to help the child victims of war, whose predicament the author purports to be highlighting.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|I think director David Yates did as much with the material as could be expected. He got their best performances yet from the three stars, there was a little more humor than in the book (very welcome) and the outdoor locations were imaginative and in some cases majestic. All the vital plot ingredients were there to prepare viewers for the grand finale in part 2. Having said that, I found this an unsatisfying movie just because I wanted to see Part 2 immediately, not in 8 months' time. It's not that I don't know what happens, it's just that the first part of the movie resolves nothing. Once we see Part 2, it will be possible to pass a judgement on the whole. This instalment was good, but rather like trying to rate a meal when all you've had is the appetizer.    A warning: as is apparent from other reviews, this movie even more than the others relies on the viewer knowing the story in some detail before watching it. If you are a Harry Potter fan (like me), no problem. If you haven't got a good knowledge of the story so far, either bring yourself up to date with it up to the end of book/movie #6, or don't waste your time watching this one. It won't mean a thing to you.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The three *The Lord of the Rings* films [all directed by Peter Jackson] have clearly made film history, chiefly due to their marked overall excellence. This film trilogy, shot entirely in New Zealand, is breathtaking at a minimum. Here, I'm reviewing the *Special Extended Edition* [as opposed to the much shorter Theatrical Version] of the second of these films on DVD, *The Two Towers*.<br /><br />I'm sure that the story is familiar to most who would show an interest in this film but, for the unindoctrinated, the overall adult fantasy trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien chronicles a group of travelers which includes a wizard, two men, a dwarf, an elf, and four hobbits, ergo: \\"The Fellowship\\". They are traveling because two evil wizards have joined forces to eventually conquer and enslave all inhabitants of Middle Earth. At the behest of these dark and nefarious sorcerers are orcs, trolls, wargs, and other heinous minions.<br /><br />One of the hobbits [Frodo Baggins] has inherited a magic ring from an aged relative [Bilbo Baggins, of *The Hobbit* fame, a fantasy written by Tolkien for young people] and it soon becomes clear that this is *The One Ring* which rules all other magic rings of power within Middle Earth. It was created by The Dark Lord [Sauron, the more powerful of the two evil wizards] but it was inadvertently lost for many years. As The Ring [which can render one invisible, with certain negative caveats] ultimately ends up in the hands of Frodo, it becomes his quest (along with the rest of The Fellowship) to destroy the ring at Mount Doom, a huge volcano which lies within Sauron's sinister and well-patrolled realm of Mordor.<br /><br />In *The Two Towers* the viewer is brought back into the tale just after a partial dissolution of The Fellowship has occurred. This nuance is a deviation from the first film [*The Fellowship of the Ring*] which is a very linear tale. Here, the story diverges into three or more directions: the journey of Sam and Frodo to destroy The Ring; Aragorn's development as a warrior and as a prospective King, and; Gandalf the Wizard's plan for dealing with the Evil sorcerers, Saruman and Sauron.<br /><br />One could rightly say that this film has no beginning and no end, being derived from the middle book of a trilogy; however, this movie stands on its own, especially in the Special Extended Edition version which is being reviewed here. One could watch this film with no knowledge of either Tolkien's trilogy of books or the other two films of the series and still enjoy it. If it doesn't actually have an ending, it does still feature a *conclusion* of a sort. I don't think viewers are left hanging.<br /><br />Director Peter Jackson, the cast, and the crew got ever more proficient as they produced these three films. Jackson sort of viewed his task as making one long film, thus the scenes were not shot in sequence, quite typical of film-making, but noting also that most films are not nine hours in length. Naturally, many changes were adopted within the scripts of all three films as time rolled along... and thus each movie clearly became better than its predecessor.<br /><br />I think that most of the *MAGIC* of this film trilogy came from Jackson's inclusion of multiple technologies and special effects techniques - he did not wholly depend upon Computer Generated Images but when he did they were effected in post-production with absolute perfection.<br /><br />Additional film magic was manifested through Howard Shore's magnificent classical filmscore for the trilogy. There is little doubt from my view that the soundtrack from this second film of the series was the greatest of the three. One of the outstanding segments includes singing by Isabel Bayrakdarian, a terrific Canadian soprano who is currently my favorite of all. The *Rohan* score is equally inspiring.<br /><br />Of course the Special Extended Editions contain much more original music than the theatrical versions and it's all a great joy to the ear, even including the gloom and doom facets of the three soundtracks. They are available as three individual sets: [[ASIN:B000BNI90O The Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring (The Complete Recordings)]], [[ASIN:B000IZJZIK The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (The Complete Recordings)]], and, [[ASIN:B000V6BE6M The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (The Complete Recordings)]].<br /><br />Perhaps the most important facet of my review is to encourage you to not bother with watching the theatrical versions of these films on DVD, and this is especially applicable if you've never read Tolkien's books. The theatrical versions are very good but they were meant more for theaters to collect from patrons for two showings per evening rather than to convey the details of Tolkien's complex story. The Special Extended Editions are perfectly edited to be both impressive and informative but they are never boring.<br /><br />WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! *The Two Towers* provides us with an exciting Battle at Helm's Deep between Saruman's minions and the men of both Rohan and Gondor [the elves help out too], as well as the Ents' assault on Isengard, the Tower of Sauron; the continuing flight of Frodo and Sam into Mordor itself in an effort to destroy The Ring, and; all the dangers and hazards which befall Aragorn, Legolis [the elf], two of the Hobbits, and Gimli [the Dwarf]. The story jumps around from place to place (and from story to story) but it's all quite well-done and coherent. Since Tolkien depicted several towers in Middle Earth we cannot precisely say this for certain but, it would appear that *The Two Towers* are those of Saruman and of Sauron -- or at least Christopher Lee thinks so and so do I.<br /><br />Every facet of this film manifests the cutting edge of every aspect of film-making, from the technology, even extending to the acting [and motion capture] of Andy Serkis who plays the creature Gollum, who really develops in this second film of the trilogy. We get to experience a broad range of acting styles from Orlando Bloom (who was cast for the role of Legolis fairly fresh out of acting school) to the venerable Christopher Lee [Saruman] who has made more films than anyone else that I'm aware of. To a person, all were magnificent in their perfectly cast roles.<br /><br />Fans of the trilogy should also be aware that even though the character Denithor [Steward of Gondor] does not appear in the theatrical version of *The Two Towers*, he does show up in this Special Extended Edition. It's also a chance to see Boromir [Denithor's eldest son] again and the segment is quite a good one.<br /><br />This is probably a good juncture to detail what one gets in this boxed-set edition. There are two DVDs which make up the film and there are *multiple* sound tracks which can be brought up on each of these, depending upon whether you wish to watch the films themselves or listen to various available commentary tracks [for example, a track of cast member running remarks as the film progresses]. Two more DVDs make up the total of four: these two are the appendices which beautifully depict exactly how this film was made, cast and crew interviews, details of the musical score, and so on. All this lasts for at least as long as would the film itself and it's all quite fascinating and well-done. Finally, the set comes with a small pamphlet inside which is a sort of map of what to look for on the DVDs and where.<br /><br />I can hardly convey an adequate number of positive comments about this film except to say that the final film [*The Return of the King*] is even better! I cannot state that this is the best film I've ever seen but I can honestly comment that I've never enjoyed any films *more* than those included in this Special Extended Edition trilogy.<br /><br />Highly recommended.acks.

B003NHRGSQ|5.0|I loved this book I finished it in like a day i hope the series keeps going!!!!! Such a good ending, a real cliff hanger.
B004BSEKH6|3.0|I'm going to give it a chance.  I took advantage of the 'special price' on Amazon; so I don't feel bad about the purchase.  This cd has all of the elements of hip hop meets pop.  I'm not a Nicki Manaj fan; however I prefer her singing voice over her rapping persona, voice, or whomever she is while recording.  I'm up to track #9 and so far, I've skipped one song.  I'm glad that she did not come with the hard beats; which would have been too much for her squeaky voice.  I gave it three stars, feeling as some of the other comments; that the guest appearances' tracks were a little more enjoyable (exception> Your Love and Right Thru Me).
B0009XNUK0|3.0|I got this, rather than greatest hits or #1's and then regretted it.  A lot of his music is classic for all time, but a lot of the stuff on this double CD is not, in fact, essential, at least not to me.  I should have gone for a more compact and limited compendium.
0817439390|5.0|Love the pictures and explanations.  This is great for anyone who is breaking into the DSLR market and wants to use them like they were meant to be used and not as a \\"point and shoot\\" camera.
1439133948|5.0|This installment in the Vorkosigan universe was more along the lines of earlier entries. Less romance, not a great deal of danger, but a number of good involving mysteries to keep the story moving along nicely. Well written, as always. The opening is a textbook example of how to immediately hook your reader.     Good Stuff!
B002ZG98Q4|5.0|I have been a fan of disney ever since the little mermaid first came out, and have been a fan of the 2d since. And the one that stood the top in all the 2d animated movies of disney was Beauty and The Beast, which truly was worthy of its oscar. It had the magic of story telling that would wish you were in a fairy tail story. Sadly since then I have not seen any disney animated film worthy of an oscar not less to say but the magic was gone. After the 3d came in, I liked Toy Story but again no magic, and I personally didn't like \\"UP\\" although people liked it but I didn't. However, this is the first 3d animated movie that I WOULD SAY, has brought back the magic of disney again. I can't describe it but the magic is back and in 3d. if it were to me, I would say that this is going to be a big hit and I hope it wins an award.   Not only is the story good, but also the characters. Its laugh out loud funny, the characters suit there roles perfectly, and you won't get bored. It is a good family movie, and I would recommend it to everyone to watch this movie. You would remember again the disney magic when Beauty and the Beast came out. And you would surely like this one too.
B00005K3PZ|3.0|I think most others have had a much more favorable response to this performance and interpretation than I have.  It has the ingredients to be a great performance, but it falls quite short of that.  In its favor, anything that Carlo Maria Giulini does is worth a listen, especially his Bruckner.  He brings to this symphony a genuine understanding and reverence for Bruckner's astonishing music.  The symphony gets off to an exceptionally strong start with the first movement, which is done better than any other performance I've heard.  It's urgent, white-hot, and Giulini plays up the stresses and dissonances in the music more than most performances, setting up the rest of the symphony *really* well.  And then it's all downhill from there.  The second movement, one of the most spiritual movements Bruckner ever wrote, lies flat and inert, two-dimensional rather than three-dimensional.  The third movement has no bite or urgency at all, it's more like a frolic.  And the fourth movement, with the cuts observed (which totally disrupt the structure), seems in a rush to just get it over with, missing so much along the way.  It's too bad, because I really think Giulini is capable of much better than this.  Certainly his Bruckner performances grew more imposing as time went on, culminating in the overwhelmingly magnificent performance of Bruckner's 9th with the Vienna Philharmonic on DG--a must if you haven't purchased it.<br /><br />Fortunately, there is a GREAT performance of Bruckner's 2nd available, and that's Karajan's performance with the Berlin Philharmonic on DG, available as a part of his boxed set, or as a single disc if you look for on the website that maintains a remarkable Arkiv (hint hint).  While the sound is less than optimal, the performance is stunning and moving beyond words.  Anyone who suggests that Bruckner's 2nd symphony is anything less than a masterpiece has not heard Karajan's white-hot, passionate, deeply spiritual, and tremendously moving performance.  Those who love Bruckner must hear it.  Horst Stein's recording with the Vienna Philharmonic on Decca/London is also very good, but certainly not in the same league as Karajan's definitive performance (though not definitive recording).Those who love Bruckner must hear it.

142311339X|5.0|The Lost Hero totally fulfilled all my wishes and desires for it. It's still Camp Half-Blood (even if Chiron is especially cranky and unhelpful in this go-round), but it's not just more of the same. We're not so far into the future that Percy and Annabeth are former legends, nor are we so close to the end of the last Percy book that we have to sit around and watch them make out all the time. They're not even main characters in this story, just cameo characters. The addition of the children of all the minor gods makes everything a bit more hectic and crowded and crazy, but the explanations of the various gods and their traits are still there. Not only do we get Piper, Leo and Jason as new characters, but there are a bunch of new potentially important folks back at camp as well.     I couldn't have asked for more, and I doubt other fans of the Percy Jackson books could either.      It's a bit more complicated, a bit more multi-layered, and a bit longer than the Percy books. But then, the characters (and the original Percy fans) are also a bit older. New readers will fare just fine without having read the Percy books (so far), but I have a feeling that won't be the case for much longer. And Percy fans will love the continuation of the Camp Half-Blood story.      Book source: Philly Free Library
0439023491|5.0|A fabulous book with unexpected turns. When I purchased the first book, \\"the Hunger Games\\" the clerk looked at me and said \\"buy it and you won't be disappointed\\", I wasn't and I got the following two thru Amazon... read and you won't be left out...M
B000035P5E|5.0|Donald Sutherland does an excellent job in this spy thriller/WWII era drama.  You at once REALLY like the character, then hate him; yet,as the tale evolves, I almost hope he succeeds because he is so careful, articulate, and cunning.  Then he bcomes almost the sociopath in lack of conscience, and his activities and deceits make him the perfect despised villain.  Kate Nelligan really deserves commendation for a beautiful job in this movie.  She is a beautiful actress, and her depiction of this character is so good, I found myself \\"in her mind\\" during parts of the movie. MOST ENJOYABLE!!
B000001ELD|3.0|Ain't a big fan of Gene Simmons but the music on this album is good. Gene Simmons is a 1978 solo album from the bassist and vocalist of American hard rock band Kiss. It was one of four solo albums released by the members of Kiss on September 18, 1978. The other albums were released by Ace Frehley, Paul Stanley and Peter Criss. The album reached #22 on the US Billboard album chart, making it the highest placing of all the four \\"Kiss\\" solos of 1978. It was certified platinum on October 2, 1978, having sold 1,000,000 copies. Although he is the bass player in KISS, on his solo album he played mainly electric and acoustic guitars, leaving the bass duties to Neil Jason.  The album features guest appearances from several well known performers, including Aerosmith's Joe Perry, Bob Seger, Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen, and Cher. Though an unknown at the time, backing vocalist Katey Sagal would go on to a successful television career, starring on such programs as Married with Children, 8 Simple Rules, and Lost.  Simmons re-recorded \\"See You In Your Dreams\\" because he reportedly wasn't happy with the way it was recorded on Rock and Roll Over.
B000X9UCEW|5.0|I recieved this CD recently. The service at Amazon is great. I have just discovered this artist while listing to Pandora, the internet radio. It is a combo of new age and classical. The sound is soothing and exciting. Top of my play list!
B00000AFDW|5.0|I feel this album was a way for KISS,---scratch that I mean Paul and Gene to make a lot of money. Gene and Paul seen how successful the Farewell Tour turned out having Ace and Peter along for the ride and decided to make an album. And if you are an Ace Frehley fan this screws with your head. In other words I feel it was false advertising.  Following Kiss highly successful 1996-1997 reunion tour, Psycho Circus was marketed as the first studio album by the band's original lineup since 1979's Dynasty (as Peter Criss did not participate on 1980's Unmasked). As with Dynasty and Unmasked, however, many of the songs were recorded by uncredited players. Guitarist Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss were used sparingly, with Criss only playing drums on \\"Into the Void.\\" (He had also played on only one Dynasty song.) Frehley played on only three songs from the album (not including vocals). In a radio interview with Eddie Trunk following his departure Criss stated that only \\"Into the Void\\" featured instrumental contributions from all four members.  Regarding the lack of cohesion in the group at the time of recording, Stanley stated \\"We tried to do a Kiss album, and it was an ill-fated attempt because there was no real band, and continued by adding \\"For a band to make a great album, it has to share a common purpose, and we didn't have it.  Despite the controversy, Psycho Circus debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200, selling 110,000 copies in its first week of release, and was certified Gold by the RIAA on October 22, 1998. U.S. SoundScan sales of the album total 479,000 copies. \\"We Are One\\" peaked at #4 on the Showbizz Magazine (Brazil) radio chart. Thus the album is not by the original line-up. But if you are a true KISS fan it must be in your collection.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|If you read this book, and still think afterwards that evolution is merely a theory, you clearly haven't read the book carefully enough.  Incredibly persuasive evidence.
B000005RY7|5.0|KISS Killers is personally my favorite album. This album is a must have for any KISS fan. Not only is it rare it includes four tracks that you can't get on any other KISS studio album. Although a hits album it still feels like it was all laid down for this one cover. The only down side of this album is that, even though Ace Frehley is on the cover he had nothing to do with putting it together. And his god like musicianship can't be found on tracks 1,2,7, and 8. Bob Kulick took over lead guitar for this album, and even though not Ace he did a kick a** job at lead. I strongly recommend this album to anyone.
B000084T18|5.0|The album that kicked off a movement and 50's  been trying to recapture the magic ever since. Many Men, Poor Lil Rich, If I Can't, Patiently Waiting, Back Down and of course In Da Club, production line up is crazy, and Fif is on his A Game. One of the last real hip hop classics that really changed the game
B00000AF95|5.0|Animalize is the 12th studio album by the American band Kiss. In a continuation of the commercial resurgence begun with Lick It Up, Animalize was certified platinum by the RIAA on December 12, 1984. It was the highest-selling Kiss album since 1977's Alive II.  The album marked the only appearance by lead guitarist Mark St. John, who replaced Vinnie Vincent in April 1984. St. John would be forced to leave Kiss during the subsequent tour after being diagnosed with Reiter's Syndrome. By November 1984 he was out of the band; the third lead guitarist to exit the band in two years.  When asked what 'Animalize' meant, Stanley said that people were starting to become more like computers and that \\"making music by pressing buttons\\" was no fun.  Mark Norton (aka Mark St John) stated that when recording this record, he had utilized his Rockman gear, and that heavy equalization was used to take the \\"Boston\\" sound out of the recording.  Throughout the years, \\"Heaven's on Fire\\" has been the only song from the album played regularly on live performances. One of my fav's, my opinion this album should have come post Lick It Up.
B0007P3582|4.0|This album gets hated on way to much, sure it wasn't up the standards of Get Rich, but overal it was a very solid album, with 3 huge singles. Outta Control, Gunz Come Out, My Toy Soldier, Baltimore Love Thing, God Gave Me Style, I'm Supposed To Die Tonight. Fif shows versatility and his hook game is top notch, album bangs from start to finish with only a couple minor road bumps
B000001ELF|5.0|My favorite solo album out of the four, Ace Frehley is a 1978 solo album from the lead guitarist and vocalist of American hard rock band Kiss. It was one of four solo albums released by the members of Kiss on September 18, 1978.<br />\\"New York Groove\\" rose to #13 on the US Billboard chart, the highest showing for a Kiss single since \\"Beth\\" in 1976, until the song \\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\\" a year later reached #11. The album itself reached #26 on the US Billboard album chart. It was certified Platinum on October 2, 1978, when it sold 1,000,000 copies.<br />The album featured Anton Fig on drums, who would later perform session work on the Kiss albums Dynasty and Unmasked, as well as become a member of Ace Frehley's post-Kiss band Frehley's Comet. Fig, along with Will Lee, who played bass on three tracks on this album, would become permanent members of Paul Shaffer's band on Late Night with David Letterman and The Late Show with David Letterman.<br />It was also the highest selling out of all for solo albums.

0312600844|5.0|There is an inverse Bell Curve formed by a strange proportion of people who either loved Freedom and Gave it 5 Stars or hated it and gave it 1 Star.<br /><br />If you like Franzen's style then you will probably like Freedom. It's not for everyone.  Then again neither is his late best Friend David Foster Wallace.<br /><br />I would give it a whirl online by previewing some pages first before picking it up.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I really like Franzen's characters and his character driven literary style.
6304084145|2.0|I just was able to view \\"Mayerling\\" recently (2010) on the wonderful TCM channel with rather mixed  emotions.The star cast most certainly good actors with some exceptions,but for this movie horribly  miscast. The hyped great \\"Love story\\" didn't exist,certainly on Rudolf's side,for him it was just  another \\"fling\\".Marie Vetsera was a TEENAGER (not an obvious older woman)when she met Rudolf and  soon found herself pregnant by him.Countess Larisch,herself a former mistress of R.helped her to  get an abortion- which in those days was a risky endeavor in any case.The abortion was botched but  the couple was not aware what would be in store for both of them.To \\"recuperate\\" Marie and R.had  themselves driven to the estate of Mayerling,where after approximately a day or so,Marie literally  bled to death---Rudolf must have been in absolute terror and turmoil with no way out-finally he  decided to take his own life.After the couple were discovered the Hapsburg elite and Secret Police  (yes,Virginia-even in those days Austria had them)decided to cover up this,to them,cataclysmic event  It would take too long to write what happended to the body of this poor girl--but from that time on  our fairy tale story was born----Rudolf \\"shot\\" first Marie and then himself because he thought   that they never would be allowed to marry.Ha!!!Of course to this day not a word of any pregnancy-  or the truth of what really happened at Mayerling.It makes one wonder---------
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I really didn't want to see this movie but I am so glad I did! It is funny, sweet, heart tugging, colourful good fun! The characters are so well developed I quickly saw them as real people, that little boy scout is the cutest boy scout ever, and the colours and visuals are magnificent. The story line is perfect for children and adults. A gem of a movie
B000ATQYT2|4.0|This is such a great film, and my wife and I look forward to watching it every Christmas season.  And yet, there is always the grousing (primarily by me) about the fact that we have to watch it in full screen \\"pan and scan\\" mode in order to get the entire film, including the scene with Scrooge and Belle and the song \\"When Love Is Gone\\" (which we both agree is critical to the story... not to mention that it's the best song in the soundtrack).    For those who doubt whether the song was really intended to be part of the teatrical release, I would politely point out that the song is reprised around the dinner table at Bob and Emily's house at the end of the film, PLUS, it is featured as part of the music over the closing credits, in a version that was clearly designed for radio airplay.  So, an essential part of the film as it was initially conceived and executed has been inexplicably cut from the widescreen version available to fans.  Why?
B0046IGOIO|5.0|I saw The Doors four times live in concert. Belive me when I say this is an excellent show.Albert King's guitar work is outstanding.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Coming from an action film expert, Finally, a very well done movie.  Hit Girl makes a hit.  Did not know that movie came out in Blu-ray already.  Ordering it after I write this review.  Start to finish- not a dull moment.  Hit Girl should have been \\"Kick Ass\\".  Hoping that they come out with part 2.  Definately keeping an eye out for that one.  If your thinking about it- STOP and Walk the walk- to your local electronics store and pick up the movie.  And do me a favor.  Do this movie some justice and pick up the Blu-ray version.  And oh!!! by the way, \\"YOUR WELCOME\\" in advance.
030726999X|4.0|Book was a lot cheaper than in stores.  It was supposed to arrive in 2 days, ended up being about a week.  That was OK simply because I had to finish the 2nd book still.  The pages on the book aren't straight, worries me a bit.  Seems fine though and is hard cover version.
B0018AK9RA|1.0|This album is so far beyond bad, I don't even know where to begin.  This is a contender for worst metal album of all time.  That is, if you can even consider it a metal album, since most of the songs are plodding keyboard ballads.  Make a compilation of the slowest, mellowest, worst songs Judas Priest has ever done, and it will be far superior to this slab of vomit.  This album makes Turbo and Ram It Down sound like metal classics.  Seriously!  If Rob Halford had collaborated on an album with Billy Joel, I would expect it to be better than this.  I don't know how Tipton and Downing can even look in the mirror.  Guardians should be appointed for the members of this band, because they've obviously all gone senile and lost the capacity to use rational judgment or manage their own affairs.  And anybody who says this album is even tolerable listening material has to have all their opinions about music disregarded as non-credible.  I WORSHIP Judas Priest, but this album makes me want to shoot myself in the head.
030745455X|5.0|Brand new book, got for a lot cheaper than a store.  Came in the 2 days for shipping.  Loved the book!
B002VPE1B6|3.0|The movie would be great, except for the Blue Ray problems.  We have an Insignia Blue Ray player and Avatar is not playing right on it.  It's not limited to LG or Samsung, it's everything.  It keeps skipping and/or stopping completely.  It's very frustrating.  You may want to find an internet version and watch it there.  Not worth buying the Blue Ray disk.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|This season was great!  I don't care what the other reviews have to say!  I thought the Bowland storyline was great.  I wish they didn't depart at the end of the season.  I gotta say that I am pretty tired of a new family every season.  People don't move that quickly in a neighborhood like that!  A lot of the story is very far-fetched, but it is my guilty pleasure!  So I will wait another year until the next season comes out on DVD.
B003L77GG0|5.0|I have watched this show from the very first episode.  I have truly enjoyed every episode of season 10 so far. I my humble opinion this is by far the best season.  This season finally made want all the seasons on dvd.  The sets normally cost 59, 48 or 42 dollars.  They were too pricey for me to catch up or so i thought. Thank God I decided I wanted the sets during the holiday season. I waited for Black Friday hoping for a deal. I found the perfect price and  acquired seasons 1-9 of this show from Best Buy on Black Friday for $ $9.99 each. Now I can watch this show whenever I want. This is still no consolation I will miss the show when it ends.  I  will also miss the actors that made this show great. I wish them the best in their future endeavors.  I will watch all the  seasons (especially season 10, if I can find it for $9.99 next Black Friday )with a smile on my face.

0307278255|5.0|I noticed the other day that a new word has entered my lexicon--\\"Lahiriesque.\\" I used it when I was trying to describe just how wonderful a particular book (The Rain God by Arturo Islas) was to a group of friends. My friends, all of whom had read Unaccustomed Earth and Interpreter of Maladies, immediately knew what I meant--a work of the highest artistic order, with precise images, no word out of place, psychological nuance and sharp depictions of emotion, thematic depth, and separate stories somehow orchestrated to make a clear aesthetic and emotional statement. \\"Lahiriesque\\" pretty well means literary perfection.     And really, perfection is just about what Unaccustomed Earth is. And I'm one of those English teachers who'll almost never give students a 100 because no writing is perfect. Lahiri would get a hundred.    Lahiri's best piece is the title story, \\"Unaccustomed Earth,\\" a tale of a father helping his daughter to cope with the loss of her mother. It's a beautiful, sad but gentle, story that ends with an image that guides the book. Other excellent stories include \\"Year's End,\\" the story of a young man's difficulty dealing with the death of his mother and his father's new family, and \\"Going Ashore,\\" the story of two young lovers' different paths in life. Together, they speak to the experience of loss, to the difficulty we Americans (immigrants or not) have establishing and maintaining roots, and to the struggles we have of maintaining relationships and personal direction. All of the stories sparkle and build upon one another. Together, they make a true and beautiful collection.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|This movie has a great rating on RottenTomatoes.com from both \\"pro-critics\\" and viewers alike. This movie has a great deal of feedback from people on Amazon, who love it too...but why? I thought this movie sucked.<br /><br />I like Science Fiction and grew up reading Larry Niven, watching the original Star Wars trilogy, loving Aliens (perhaps best sci-fi movie ever), and playing a lot of \\"Star Frontiers,\\" which is D&D in space (I played A LOT of normal AD&D too).<br /><br />Now I have never seen Firefly, but this is a movie that should be at least good on it's own merits somewhat right? But it's not, it's really really bad. My gut even wants to give it one star, but that should be saved for really really bad movies, I could at least sit through this.<br /><br />First, it's a diluted, dilapidated version of Star Wars. I won't accuse it of being a rip-off or a copy (and I don't think it was intentionally-although others may know better) However, the captain was so much a crappy copy of Han Solo, even the clothes and the pistol belt and well, just about everything, it was painful to watch. Of course that role of the rouge (hidden idealist) captain is almost an archetype now, which makes it even more silly and what's even worse is the archetype big strong loud guy on the ship (name is not worth remembering) and the token black girl (wait, no, they're not worse, the captain is the worst offender). More than that, What's with the contemporary clothes, ESPECIALLY the Hawaiian shirt worn by the pilot, how silly is that? Reminds me of Dex's silly dinner in \\"Attack of the Clones,\\" and the stupid cigarettes and other references to current popular culture.<br /><br />Next, The acting was poor, and so where the props.<br /><br />The technology was silly and there are more efficient ways to do certain things with current technology today. I am talking here about certain vehicles and weapons and communication, etc.<br /><br />And finally, the thing I think that might have been the dumbest were the \\"Reavers.\\" There is no explanaition given (I doubt there is a good one anywhere) about how people that have gone so mad that the cut their faces, use projectile weapons that fire blades and spiked balls (in an age of inter-planetary space flight)and fight and act like Neanderthals can operate, pilot, or even maintain, space ships...yet they're some terrible force.<br /><br />The rest of the movie was more passable...<br /><br />I am welcome to comments to open my eyes to the light...but I can't imagine what they could be, and I know I am not alone because I read a few other reviewers that had similar complaints as mine coming in.planaition given (I doubt there is a good one anywhere) about how people that have gone so mad that the cut their faces, use projectile weapons that fire blades and spiked balls (in an age of inter-planetary space flight)and fight and act like Neanderthals can operate, pilot, or even maintain, space ships...yet they're some terrible force.

B00000JGHL|3.0|Rate: 6<br />Viewed: 6/04, 5/05<br /><br />5/05: Forget everything in City Hall.<br /><br />Instead, focus your eyes on Al Pacino who is at his thrilling best.<br /><br />City Hall has been Al, Al, Al all the way through.<br /><br />What a mesmerizing performance Al Pacino gave as the corrupt mayor John Pappas. The best part of the film is Pappas' funeral speech which is a moving one.<br /><br />Whenever Al Pacino appears, City Hall is on a fast pace. When he is absent, everything comes at a standstill.<br /><br />The story is an interesting one with a lot of politics involved. It's a bit of a labyrinth to navigate through, needing some clarity at times.<br /><br />Although inconsistent, John Cusack plays an intriguing character, and Danny Aiello does enough to make his role to work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Bridget Fonda still can't act, failing to live up to the demands of the material.<br /><br />All in all, Al Pacino is vintage in City Hall.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This is my favorite Blu Ray in my collection. The video and audio quality are absolutely amazing and the the extras...well, there are just too many to list.

B003NFM3JU|3.0|I thought this movie had a few great 3D moments which made great viewing. Exactly the reason why I bought a 3D TV for Home. But, the movie itself I thought was not suited for the PG rating it's given. My 6 & 7year old boys can watch Iron Man 1 & 2 and understand the plot / storyline. With this movie they were forever asking \\"Whats going on Dad...\\". Great graphics, good storyline, but dialogue not designed for children under 13. Extra star given for the 3D effects.
1601252463|4.0|The advanced players guide is a must have addition to any PF game.  The new classes seem well balanced for the most part.  At first glance, some of the new classes looked a little underpowered but after really getting stuck into tactical play, hidden strengths emerged which make all the difference.  In the hands of a lazy or inexperienced player, a witch will get herself slaughtered very quickly... an experienced player however will make any one crossing her very sorry indeed!    In addition to new classes, there are new prestige classes (8), new paths/variations for most existing classes (anti-paladin anyone?!), feats (160+ including metamagic and team work feats), spells (150+), equipment, armour, weapons, magic items, artifacts and optional rule systems (combat maneuvers, hero points and traits).    Yes that's a lot!  The best thing is because so much effort went into the play testing period - they are all well thought out, robust and a balanced addition the existing system.    The danger of this book is that there is so much new information to digest.  We have taken the tactic of allowing PC's immediate acccess to any modification to the existing classes but a slower introduction of the new classes and prestiges.  Feats, spells etc are introduced slowly anyway due to their nature of acquisition but a new class brings a whole pile all at once.  Try introducing multiple classes all at once and I guarantee your game degenerates into a rule quoting, book referencing, 6 way argument...!
B003O85W3A|4.0|So, so good. My favorite is still Funeral, but maybe because I've only listened to the Suburbs a few times. What I love about Arcade Fire is that every song is different than the last.  I tire easily with other bands because their music sounds the same across an album. AF is so much better.
030014332X|5.0|Introducing a young child to world history is hard enough, and in my search for a book that is both engaging and honest to the audience I have been disappointed with what I've found.  However, Gombrich's Little History is one gem in the rough.  In the preface of the Yale University Press, 2008, edition I have, the granddaughter describes how her grandfather, E.H. Gombrich, came to write the book this way: \\"A young publisher with whom he was acquainted asked him to take a look at a particular English history book for children, with a view to translating it into German.\\"  Apparently Gombrich had no formal training in history, yet set out and completed his own rendition of the topic in six weeks shortly after \\"My grandfather was not impressed by what he read\\".    There are at least three relatively popular books that set out to introduce young children to world history, including this one.  It is helpful to compare this one is relation to the other two I am most familiar with.    V.M. Hillyer, the first headmaster of the Calvert School wrote A Child's History of the World in the 1920's.  Perhaps this was the English history book Gombrich was asked to translate?  If not, I suspect Gombrich may have seen it and perhaps even modeled his own after it.  The organization, length and topics are very similar.  A notable difference in the original Hillyer edition compared to Gombrich's attempt is that it is riddled with what today can only be considered offensive, racist and outright dangerous cultural perspectives of people and civilizations.  The Calvert School has published a more recent edition with much of the offensive language removed, but it still largely assumes a Judeo-Christian readership, which may be just as unacceptable for the non-religious.  In a nutshell, Gombrich does at least as good a job if not better in telling the world's story without offending and without assuming any particular world view.  Note, Gombrich does not leave God entirely out of the story, but has done so in a way that does not make religion the central, driving force.    The Story of the World by Susan Wise Bauer is a series of four volumes on world history.  Each volume in the series is roughly the length of Gombrich or Hillyer's text alone.  Unsurprisingly Bauer's series covers a lot more specifics and detail than Gombrich and Hillyer and unlike Gombrich's, Bauer's is targeted as a textbook for history in school.  In fact, Bauer's series is unsurprisingly popular with home schoolers with little else in the market to choose from.  Bauer too has probably seen Hillyer and Gombrich's books and been influenced by them.  Her first volume starts off in a similar manner in explaining what history is.  Bauer is less careful about separating religious myth from scientifically verified history, which can be a turn-off for the non-religious.  However, careful instruction from a well informed teacher or parent can help offset that drawback.  The bigger difference is in the quality of the writing.  Gombrich and even Hillyer are far more effective at telling the story and, Gombrich especially, are much more effective writers than Bauer.    If the goal is to introduce world history to a young child and help stimulate interest in the subject, Gombrich's A Little History of the World is an excellent choice.  Furthermore, many children's nonfiction books would be condescending to adults, but not only is Gombrich's engaging for a child, it is still mature enough for any adult looking for a good introduction to the topic.  It is divided into 40 short chapters of about 3 to 6 pages in length, each covering a particular time period or major historic event.  It's conversational style lends itself to discussion, questions and thoughtful consideration.  For a subject that could span thousands of pages to satisfactorily meet everyone's view of what is important world history, Gombrich aims and sets out to limit the scope.  Arguably much of the interesting and important worldhistory is left out, but as the granddaughter tells us, from the Turkish edition, Gombrich admits \\"that this book is not, and never was, intended to replace any textbooks of history that may serve a very different purpose at school.  I would like my readers to relax, and to follow the story without having to take notes or to memorize names and dates\\".    To answer those who feel their own favorite event, period or region of world history was neglected or glossed over, I think J.M. Roberts' comments in the 5th edition of his New History of the World aptly help to appreciate the limitations on any attempt at writing a book on world history.  \\"I cannot but write as an elderly, white, middle-class, British male.  If that seems a shortcoming too grave to overcome, other approaches can be found, but the reader must weigh them, too, in similar scales before he or she comes to a judgment.\\"

B00003CXBK|4.0|This movie has a feel that is not found in Miyazaki's other movies. It has a powerful and dark message - I'd say it's definitely more adult than some of his other films. Of course, the movie is beautiful and the journey it takes you on is totally worthwhile and unforgettable. It's something you need to experience if you're a Miyazaki fan!
B0042JTDXK|1.0|As a rabid Grobanite of ten years, I was REALLY excited for this album. Every time Josh goes into an experimental direction, I LOVE it, and in the past, the songs he wrote have always turned out to be my favorites.    To say this album was a disappointment would be an understatement. The lyrics literally made me HOWL with laughter. To be honest, the first time I listened to the album, I was totally confused. I thought, am I listening to the right album?     And then it clicked. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED!    There was this one night, Josh was sitting in his new Manhattan penthouse, bored out of his mind, playing around making amateur recordings on garageband. He realized he only had ONE CD-R left, and he couldn't decide if he wanted to record a love letter to Paul Simon, or an audition mix tape to send to Webber and Sondheim and the like... so he compromised and squeezed them both onto one disk. Then his new manager called demanding new material. In his pot brownie induced stupor, Josh accidentally put the wrong disk in the envelope. The actual album he was working on, the amazing album that he's been slaving over for four years is in Paul Simon and Andrew Lloyd Webber's fan mail bags.    That's basically what it sounds like to me. His broadway audition mixtape smashed together with a love letter to Paul Simon. And that sounds like it could be really cool, except it's totally not.    I'm going to pretend this didn't happen and go back to \\"Awake.\\"

But also a little nervous because the first two books were so good that I feared disappointment.  I shouldn't have worried:  Kate Morton does not write a bad book.  In fact, I consider this her best!  Good job!

0061433047|5.0|I was, like many long time Terry Pratchett fans, a little worried how good this book would actually be, given Terry's condition. I was really happy that it turned out to be excellent. I was laughing out loud in places (a regular occurrence with one of his books) and was turning pages as fast as I could read them. It was great to read about Tiffany's adventures again, and thoughtful for him to tie in the whole Granny Weatherwax team, some of the Ankh-Morpork characters, and tie up a few loose ends, including one important one for Tiffany too. In all, I really enjoyed this book. I've got my fingers crossed of course that there will be a few more yet.

B0044XV3R8|1.0|Why on earth would they split the three versions across two discs? For me it ruin the viewing pleasure having to get up swap discs. The story differences aren't that spectacular, the opening scenes showing an over crowded earth and explaining Jake's brother funeral. Some of the scenes on the planet actually ruin the continuity of the battle scene.    I didn't want to give it any stars

0765326353|3.0|This is the first book in The Stormlight Archive. Sanderson is obviously much indebted to Robert Jordan in the scope of the novel, but I do not see that he particularly copied the elements of the fantasy world or the nature of the characters. Like many fantasy novels of epic scope, Sanderson takes quite a while to establish the functioning of the fantasy environment and to build up a stock of characters. Getting to where I particularly cared about any of the characters or felt swept up in any of the action scenes took a few hundred pages. From the beginning though, I was impressed with some of the elements of the society, particularly what can be done with Stormlight (this leads to some really awesome battle scenes!).<br /><br />The society has some interesting quirks with regards to gender. Women can be quite powerful, especially since they are the only people who can read. Yup. It is shameful for men to be much educated; reading is especially dangerous. Way to alienate much of your audience, Sanderson! (Just kidding) Seriously though, I was unsure how to feel about this: glad to see women given power or irritated to find yet another world where some things are women's work and others only for manly men. Women also (at least in Alethkar, where most of the book is set) have to cover their left hand, their 'safehand' in public; to do otherwise would be indecorous. That's a little weird. I know weird fashions happen. I could accept the hands needing to be covered, but why only one? A concession to the fact that a woman with covered hands couldn't actually do anything? Other quirks in the society that would be good to know are that the people reverence lighteyes (blue and probably green), who form the aristocracy, and that spren, spirits of sort, are attracted to pretty much everything (firespren to fire, rotspren to an infected wound, etc.).<br /><br />The characters are, obviously, numerous. The back of the book (as I mentioned earlier) detailed only three: Dalinar, Kaladin and Shallan. Dalinar is the uncle of the King and a High Prince of the powerful country of Alethkar (blah blah blah). He is a warrior, but one who endeavors to do the right thing, rather than to show up others and increase his own wealth. Visions he has been having of what may be the past have started eroding his credibility, even with his own sons. He and his eldest son, Adolin, are interesting men who I look forward to learning more about in the future. Dalinar definitely took a while to grow on me though; his macho man stuff did not particularly attract my interest, but his visions made for good fun, along with his ideals (especially in comparison with all of the jerks in Alethkar).<br /><br />Kaladin is Stormblessed, which basically means he is one lucky s.o.b. He also can wield a spear something fierce. He was the first character I really grew attached to. His manly, spear-wielding abilities definitely had something to do with it, especially when packaged in a young man (where do I sign up for one of those?), but what really interested me was something else. He attracts a windspren, which is a sort of spirit thing. This is not a common occurrence; it shows he has some sort of power, and, well, I love powers. Kaladin gets thrown down about as low as a man can go on the totem pole of life (since women are on an entirely different totem pole). Thankfully, he has the strength and awesome new powers to start pulling himself again. I would probably read the sequel just to find out what happens to Kaladin.<br /><br />Shallan is one of three female characters to receive a decent amount of page time. She is a young girl whose family has fallen on incredibly tough times (they're being hunted down by creditors and some kind of fantasy-world mafia). She travels to meet the king's sister, a great scholar, to become her ward and steal a powerful artifact, with which she should be able to save her family from utter ruin. Shallan appealed to me at first for her sharp wit, but soon irritated me with her whining. All through the book, I flip-flopped about how I felt about her character, for those exact reasons. She could be an awesome character once she increases her own sense of self (yes, I know how hard that is) and becomes a force to be reckoned with (which will be aided by her burgeoning powers).<br /><br />While I did enjoy this book, I recommend it with caution. It is long and, as observed above, reading it takes a long, long time. These fantasy novels generally attract the kind of nerds who will enjoy them (like me!). I do not think Sanderson has quite got it yet. For example, a number of characters are introduced and go through scenes which have no impact (that I could tell) on anything within this volume. While they may come into play later, it is a bit clunky and made getting into the book that much harder. Nevertheless, I think there is definitely promise in this first book and hope that the series can fulfill that.er whining.

B001UAPVDU|3.0|It's not bad for the price, and the album art is worth it alone. As everyone has been stating, this CD really showcases Lady Gaga's vocal abilities. However, as far as Lady Gaga material goes, it isn't necessarily a must-listen. If you're a collector (and more importantly, a Gaga collector) be sure to get it. To the casual listener, skip it.

B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|The Band Perry are a new country trio who are going to have a very long career in country music judging by this fantastic debut!<br />It includes the massive hit single If I Die Young,which has sky rocketed the band to an impressive level for newcomers to country music.<br />The rest of the songs are mainly uptempo and mid-tempo,such as You Lie,Miss You Being Gone,Postcard From Paris,Walk Me Down The Middle and the incredibly catchy Independence.<br />The album ends with the sorrowful Lasso.<br />Kimberly takes the lead vocals on all songs with brothers Reid and Neil providing the harmonies.<br />Plus all songs were co-written by the three of them.<br />The album is produced by Nathan Chapman(Taylor Swift) and Paul Worley(Lady Antebellum) which will give you an idea as to what their sound is like.I can see The Band Perry in the future having the same kind of success that Sugarland and Lady Antebellum are currently enjoying.<br />Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this little gem.
B0013XW2A4|3.0|I enjoyed reading this since it's an icon among banned books.  The story was entertaining, but there were long stretches of blah-blah-blah which I just scanned through.  Had absolutely no idea of what the author was saying, and didn't care either. It was interesting to read about the coal mining, though, and the description of the town and surrounding area was quite good (gloomy, depressed).  As another poster observed, the book is full of \\"typos\\" like deity/deny, and/arid, finger/linger, knows/knobs, etc.  That was annoying, but the book was cheap so I guess that's what you get for cheap.
B004AQR29C|2.0|I was ready to love this movie - and yes, I know it is an action movie. Crank was an action movie but the chase, fight, leap, run scenes were interesting and well choreographed. AND it had some story. This movie was like a constant tumble down a hill.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|You're at the store holding Keane's latest CD in your hands. The album art is cool, the song titles catchy, the stickers on the front claim it's \\"a game changer,\\" and some of the songs even feature other artists. You've liked Keane's stuff in the past, even if it has been a little all over the map as far as styles go. But so far everything seems to be telling you this will be a good CD.<br /><br />Lies. Run. Just run away. Hide your cash and credit card in your wallet, then hide your wallet with your grandma, and make her promise not to buy you any CDs this holiday season, if only to make absolutely certain she doesn't accidentally purchase this one because it has cool album art, catchy titles and a sticker on the front saying nice things.<br /><br />Others have said it in their reviews but I'll repeat the same frustrations here, only with bullets!<br />--There are only 8 songs on the CD, which sucks even more when you find out the first \\"song\\" is a 90 second instrumental waste of space<br />--Of the guest artists, one speaks Japanese the whole time so you can't understand her and the other uses lines like \\"Hard to separate my past from a rhyme, Cos how can you separate milk from lime\\"<br />--None of the songs are memorable enough to save the rest of the CD, and some repeat the same phrase over and over again, making it seem even more like this was (poorly) thrown together at the last second<br /><br />Do you like Keane? Don't buy this CD. Do you not like Keane? Don't buy this CD.

B004E4NFSW|5.0|Long ago, two armies clashed over the fate of Greece -- and three hundred (or so they say) Spartans repelled the Persians in a climactic, self-sacrificing battle.<br /><br />And the adaptation of \\"300\\" is a stunning one -- literally stunning, since it bombards the viewer with larger-than-life characters, smashing visuals and tight direction. It goes a bit too fast for its own good, but it's a truly epic film that takes the historical war movie to another level -- all the more so because it actually happened.<br /><br />As the introduction tells us, the Spartans were the ultimate warrior people. Babies were inspected for weakness or faults, and killed if they had any; as they were growing up, they were taught and toughened by a savage regimen. Their only true hope was to \\"die beautifully\\" for their land.<br /><br />A Persian messenger arrives, telling King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) that the god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) wants the Spartans to bow to him. Leonidas' response: shove the Persians into a pit. But before he can go to war, he must consult the corrupt priesthood of Ephors and their beautiful Oracle. She predicts that Sparta will fall and the gods forbid war at the approach of the Carneaian festival -- courtesy of a hefty bribe from a Spartan traitor.<br /><br />So Leonidas takes out three hundred of his best men, along with their nervy Arcadian allies, and begin trouncing the Persians. But they are being sabotaged, both by a hunchbacked outcast and by a treacherous councilor, whom Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is battling. And so at Thermopylae, Leonidas prepares for a final battle against the monstrous Persian Army -- knowing that their story of freedom will live on.<br /><br />This is not a \\"sensitive\\" movie where you have any appreciation for the bad guys -- it's a glorification of three hundred soldiers who died for their land and freedom. It just wouldn't work otherwise. It doesn't blindly adore the Spartans -- we see their darker side in their \\"weed out the weak\\" policy -- but it does appreciate them. They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.<br /><br />And it's done in a manner appropriate to its comic book origins -- grimy, bloody and epic, but with a stylized look that is almost like CGI. The battles are shockingly good, and full of fantasy-ish creations like the monstrous creatures or the silver-masked Immortals. Even a wall of corpses. But we also get some beautiful visuals as well -- roiling seas, sunlit battlefields, Spartan cities, and the drugged Oracle in her white veil.<br /><br />While the script gets a bit over-the-top at times, it's hard not to be moved by dialogue that can be darkly funny (\\"It's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare\\") or stirring (\\"He did not wish tribute, nor song, or monuments or poems of war and valor. His wish was simple: \\"Remember us.\\" That was his hope, should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be\\").<br /><br />Butler and Headey are simply great as Leonidas and Gorgo -- they're both strong, passionate and fearless, and they both do a great job in their separate storylines. But the movie is filled with good performances -- David Wenham as the narrator, Dominic West as a disgusting traitor, Santoro as the decadent, arrogant god-king, and many others.<br /><br />This version contains both the regular and high-def versions, and apparently contains a small wealth of extras -- featurettes about the history of Thermopylae and the 300 Spartans, photo galleries, info on the Spartan culture, commentary, deleted scenes, and info on Frank Miller (who, of course, wrote the original graphic novel). It's sort of the decorative icing on a cake -- not necessary to enjoy the film, but it makes it just a bit better.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is a unique, stirring, stunning movie that pushes the action-movie envelope, and gives a thrilling edge to a real-life story of overwhelming power. A brilliant movie.
B002ZG98FU|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  Screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna bit off quite a bit more than she could chew by attempting to top her excellent 'Devil Wears Prada' with the weak romantic-comedy, 'Morning Glory'. Immediately one must suspend one's disbelief by accepting the idea that there is a morning talk show called 'Daybreak' on a fictional TV network called IBS. McKenna posits this 'Daybreak' as a competitor to the real-life 'Today' show. We're asked to accept that Daybreak has been chugging along in fourth place in the ratings for quite awhile and is peopled with co-hosts such as Paul McVee who happens to have a foot fetish (I've heard of egotistical newscasters but no network would keep a pervert and sexual harasser on their payroll under any circumstances).<br /><br />  I also found it odd that Jerry Barnes (Jeff Goldblum) would give Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) carte blanche to fire an anchorman without review from the top office. After all, she has no experience as a producer on a big TV network and she's just been hired. When she cans McVee, everyone seems relieved that she takes the big step in firing a pervert. Where was Barnes in all this? He seems like a strong executive but is content to delegate his authority to the point where he allows a young upstart to make big decisions such as firing a co-host without his input?<br /><br />  Even if one accepts the cartoon world that McKenna offers up here, the bulk of Morning Glory features the unfunny attempt on the part of Fuller to convince legendary anchorman Mike Pomeroy to \\"lighten up\\". Unfortunately, Harrison Ford has little to work with in the character of Pomeroy. He's introduced as an even more embittered Dan Rather type who self-righteously insists that morning talk shows are way beneath him. We're treated to his bromides past the midpoint of the film and Ford's depiction of Pomeroy as a churlish misanthrope with that gruff Clint Eastwood voice, wears out its welcome quite quickly.<br /><br />  The dopey romance between Becky and Adam (Patrick Wilson), who whines about his significant other's workaholic ways, does little to lighten the heavy handed banter between the two principals. The comedy actually doesn't get going until about three quarters of the film is complete. That's when Coleen Peck (Diane Keaton) and the rest of the Daybreak team (sans Pomeroy) decide to throw caution to the wind and now work completely out of the box. This is the only real fun part of the movie. Mike Malloy as Ernie the weather-caster, steals the show when he gets to do the weather while riding a Six Flags roller-coaster. There are a few other mildly amusing bits such as Peck going toe to toe with a Sumo Wrestler.<br /><br />  After Becky berates Pomeroy for the umpteenth time, he finally decides that sitting on his laurels is simply a strategy to indulge himself in a prolonged campaign of self-pity. So Pomeroy drags Becky upstate where he proves to her that he's not a has-been: Pomeroy lands the exclusive story of the governor's arrest on corruption charges. Somehow, this short breaking news item is enough to bump up the ratings so that Barnes doesn't have the cancel the show. It takes one more dressing down from Becky after Pomeroy reverts to his misanthropic ways. Now all is well in TV land. Pomeroy makes a great omelet and the ratings go through the roof! You would have thought that screenwriter McKenna would have come up with some better ideas to illustrate Daybreak's resurrection, instead of the mundane arrest of a sitting governor on corruption charges and an aging anchorman showing off his cooking skills.<br /><br />  Rachel Adams is her usual perky self and gives a fun performance as the intrepid junior producer. But coupled with the dour Ford, the relationship between the two is veritable kryptonite. When all is said and done, Morning Glory has little 'glory' at all. And come to think of it, it's not very funny either!dopey romance between Becky and Adam (Patrick Wilson), who whines about his significant other's workaholic ways, does little to lighten the heavy handed banter between the two principals.

0547258305|5.0|I really liked this. It's a great idea to look at what your life would be like if your special gift was the ability to kill with your bare hands. The twist is that the person with this gift is a young girl. Well written, really explores the topic and yet tells a great story of forgiveness, acceptance, finding one's gifts, and finding love. I picked it up as a fun fantasy read and ended up thinking it's a definite keeper.
0785125965|4.0|I am surprised by some of the comments of World War Hulk.  Personally, I liked it.  However, I should admit I am not an avid follower of the Hulk so maybe it is a \\"traditionalist\\" issue?<br /><br />Hulk has returned home to exact punishment for all that happened on Planet Hulk.  He found happiness and it was taken from him.  Those that did it shall pay.  Even though he is technically the villain and is going to cause mass destruction; I found myself rooting for the big guy.  Especially after reading the civil war series; certain proponents of the Super Hero Registration act received a serious beating.<br /><br />Some may comment about the lack of plot to the story.  I can see this but I wonder how much plot does large scale revenge require?<br /><br />Hulk and the warbound against the heros of Earth.  Much destruction and bodily damage occurs.<br /><br />The ending is a little surprising mixed with a little clich&eacute;.  *spoiler alert so skip to the next paragraph if you care*  Who exactly is the Sentry?  My first introduction was the Zombie series which didn't say much.  As I have said I am not a follower of the series so I don't know him.  He appears to be the yin to Hulk's yang.  They are friends and Sentry seems to have the ability to make Hulk relax.  This friendship adds to the intensity of the final fight.<br /><br />The artwork is exceptional and greatly adds to the story.  Don't worry about a plot.  This is one battle royal and if you can accept that, you will have fun with this story.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|This is Kanye West's \\"The Wall.\\" To call this a musical masterpiece is no exaggeration.  Just as the opus \\"The Wall\\" by Pink Floyd totally redefined what rock is, and dealt with the perils of superstardom, Kanye West does it in \\"Fantasy.\\"  I know of no other musician that works as hard, and layers as much sound into his work.  Like \\"The Wall,\\" he adds samples and effects to the music to further his narrative. There is no \\"radio single\\" here although there are massive layers of hooks.  I get the feeling he purposely spread his hooks throughout the album, intentionally avoiding the creation of a single, to maintain the coherence of the work. This music is best listened to as one complete work, much as \\"The Wall\\" is.    Despite Kanye's antics outside of the recording studio, he is a genius.  His tormented relationship with the public and inability to deal with his own music talent brings to mind Pink in The Wall.   Perhaps it takes this level of dysfunction and passion to create a musical masterpiece.  When compared to all the other pap that currently attempts to pass as music, Kanye West is head and shoulders above the rest.  This album will go down as one of the top 100 in history. While others are content to crank out simple emotionless, flimsy pop songs, Kanye West can do nothing less than build layers and layers of sound into his work of art.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Well first you have to some what like the show but, if you just watch at least the first season you should be hooked, the cast just works together so well, makes you wish your job was like cool like there's. I wasn't a fan of the show the first time I watched it, but like I said watch  season one you will be hooked and then you will be on Amazon buying all the seasons Like I did, can't wait till then season six comes out and hope they never take the show off the air, it's a great show.
2839905809|5.0|If you are going to read one business book on design, innovation and business models this is the one. I plan to give a copy to each of my adult kids.<br /><br />Business Model Generation brings together a simple but compelling framework for organizing business models with a wide range of frameworks and techniques from stragegy and design thinking. It includes important ideas around multi-sided platforms (two-sided markets for you economists), applications of design thinking, scenario plannning ... It is a powerful integration of these ideas, one that most people will be able to act on. The book also has an excellent website at [...] and the collaborative approach to authoring and validating the book is fascinating - some 470 people from around the world contributed to the book.<br /><br />I read this in parallel with Cory Doctorow's new novel Makers[[ASIN:0765312816 Makers]] and the two books riff off each other in interesting ways (the fictional company Kodacell could be seen as a scaling of the business model generation method). It is worth thinking about what happens in Makers while imaginging new business models.<br /><br />I do have some questions about the book, and a few reservations.<br /><br />Why no index? In a book like this an index is necessary, and the designers could have used this as an opportunity to innovate a visual index, perhaps using mind mapping.<br /><br />The design. I have long been advocating this kind of visual design for business books. Reading this one I had some reservations. The book is influenced by PowerPoint and web design and has some of the weaknesses, see [[ASIN:0961392169 The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint: Pitching Out Corrupts Within, Second Edition]]. I had to work hard to integrate the information and ideas in the book into a story. I am glad that the authors and designers took the approach they did, but this approach to books needs a lot more work before we really understand how to use it.<br /><br />Depth and originality. There is little that is new here. What is powerful is the way in which so many current ideas are integrated. I am not an expert in all of these areas, but where I do have some deep knowledge, pricing for example, I found the content thin and in some ways misleading.

B003WTE886|5.0|DON'T LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS THAT SAY BAD THING ABOUT THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE REPLAYED IT SO MANY UNCOUNTABLE TIMES IN MY CD PLAYER AND WHEN SOMEONE TELLS ME TO TURN IT DOWN OR OFF, I TURN TO MY IPOD (WHICH HAS ALL OF THE SONGS ON IT, BTW) HERE ARE THE RATINGS OF EACH SONG...............<br /><br />Mine- amazing, as most Taylor Swift song are. 5/5<br /><br />Sparks Fly- aammaazziinngg! really sweet. 5/5<br /><br />Back To December- a really beautiful song with rumors going around that she wrote it about Taylor Lautner. I believe those rumors because in the song, she sings \\"I miss your tan skin.\\" totally Taylor L. he played Jacob in the Twilight movies. Jacob is tan. She is apologizing to him for breaking up with him.4/5<br /><br />Speak Now- Amazing! a great song about barging in on a wedding to tell the guy that he is marrying the wrong girl and he realizes that and says hes glad she came. 5/5<br /><br />Dear John- This one is just okay.........Joe Jonas got off easy! I usually skip this track, it's almost 7 minutes long! 3/5<br /><br />The Story Of Us- A break-up rock song.

B002XTBE8I|4.0|After a 5-year hiatus, Eminem returned in early 2009 with [[ASIN:B00192M9FC Relapse]] promising a second album tentatively titled Relapse 2 later that year. As Relapse 2 began to materialize as a completely different album and realizing his promise would go unfulfilled, Eminem re-released Relapse as Refill featuring a second disc with 7 additional tracks. What began as a nice gesture, turned into a double-dip marketing scheme. Most fans don't want to purchase the entire album again for the additional seven tracks, so I'll say this before you read any further: If you already have Relapse, I'd recommend acquiring these seven tracks through a different source. If you don't have Relapse (a CD which I awarded 5 stars in my Amazon review), then it's worth your money to get Refill.  Relapse was a challenging album that it took me a while to warm up to. It took me even longer to listen to these seven tracks consecutively. The first time I tried to listen to them, nothing really caught my attention and I didn't return to it for a time. The more I listened to it, the more that stood out, and the more impressed I became with them. While not all perfect, these are pretty impressive songs that weren't just tossed onto a second-disc as an afterthought. While some sound like they were taken directly from Relapse, others fall somewhere in between the sound of that album and [[ASIN:B003KUSUG8 Recovery]].   The first track \\"Forever\\" is actually a song by new rap star Drake that features a verse by Drake himself, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, and Eminem. Between each verse is an auto-tuned chorus by Drake that gets repetitive pretty quickly especially when it's used five times in the song. I don't listen to very much hip-hop, but I was entertained by Drake's verse, while I found Kanye's verse pretty weak and even a bit embarrassing. Lil Wayne's verse is catchy and memorable, despite how out-there it is. I doubt he was very coherent when he was recording it, to be honest. With all bias aside,Eminem's verse puts these three to shame. Working with a little over a minute, Eminem's verse is one of his strongest ever; lyrically, it's strong as one would expect but his delivery is what's really impressive. He goes all out here, making keeping up with him virtually impossible. The \\"you dealing with a few true villains...\\" part is hard to say quickly let alone rap as fast as he spews it. I applaud him for this. While this is not technically an Eminem track and it takes over four minutes to get to him, it's worth the wait and you'll likely find yourself returning to the song, if not just for his verse. (5/5)  \\"Hell Breaks Loose\\" features Dr. Dre and is probably a better collaboration than \\"Old Times Sake\\" from Relapse. Dre changes up his rap style a bit for this track, but it works. Even with Eminem sporting the fake accent, it's a strong track. (5/5)  \\"Buffalo Bill\\" is the weakest track on the album. It's got a weak, annoying chorus and Em sounds a bit like Cypress Hill at the beginning of the track. With that said, even as the weakest track it's still got multiple listens from me. (4/5)  \\"Elevator\\" was the single from these seven tracks and it's got the catchiest hook of the seven, so it's clear why. It's one of the most appealing songs, the one that first grabbed me from these tracks. (5/5)  \\"Taking My Ball\\" is juvenile, ridiculous, and immature but is one of my favorite songs on here. Sometimes it's clever, sometimes it's simply childish; a lot of people will shake their head over it, but I love it.. (5/5)  \\"Music Box\\" has a thumping bass line throughout the song that makes this track unbearable through earphones, but sports one of the strongest chorus' of the seven tracks. Lyrically, it's more of the same rape/murder/stalking theme from Relapse. (4/5)  \\"Drop the Bomb on `Em\\" sounds like an outtake from [[ASIN:B00006690G The Eminem Show]], which is not a bad thing at all. Out of Eminem's solo tracks, it's probably the strongest of the five tracks. It's definitely the furthest in style from Relapse. (5/5)  Eminem's intention of supplying fans with these seven songs to hold them over until the next album was a nice gesture, but he should've released them as an EP rather than repackaging it with an album almost all of his fans already have. These tracks are worth having and I give him credit for not double-dipping with sub-par material. If you're an Eminem fan and you don't own Relapse then buy this...You'll only spend a couple extra dollars at most. If you already own that record, I'd recommend utilizing an alternative source to get these tracks.  REFILL (7 TRACKS): B+  RELAPSE (ORIGINAL ALBUM): A-  (My review for [[ASIN:B00192M9FC Relapse]] can also be found on this site)
142311339X|4.0|Jason knew the moment he woke up with absolutely no memory of who he was at the back of a school bus ,that something is seriously wrong. And then there is Leo, who claims to be his best friend and Piper, who is supposed to be his girlfriend-both of whom he doesn't remember. But when Annabeth tells them that they are children of Greek Gods and Camp Half Blood is the only safe haven for children like them, they have no idea what to expect next. As one bad news follows other there are rumours of a missing hero and a God who is supposedly kidnapped by unknown forces. Jason, Piper and Leo are three of the seven heroes of the Great Prophecy and they have to complete a dangerous new quest by the Winter Solstice before the evil wakes.<br /><br />Better than any of the other books by Rick Riordon, there is not one boring moment in this book. Admittedly the book gets a bit predictable by the end but like the author's previous books this one too is an action packed page-turner. This book too makes us revisit all the Greek myths with a modern twist - this one has Medea as saleswoman and Aeolus, the master of winds, acting as the weatherman of the Gods. Even the characters are well defined .<br /><br />Jason is the natural leader who has the right plans and keeps up the spirit of his companions. He may be confident from outside but inside he is totally confused and anguished, trying to remember who he really was. Piper has an uncommon ability to charm speak people to get what she wants. But all she really wants is to talk to her father without interruption for more than thirty seconds. But the character I liked most would be Leo who hides his anger and sadness behind humour, having the unique power to control fire. He saves his friend from the jaws of  death and is also excellent with mechanics.<br /><br />Favourite Quote:<br /> \\"...... To be perfect, you have to feel perfect about yourself - avoid trying to be something you are not.\\"<br /><br />Overall:<br />A must read, best Rick Riordon book!<br /><br />Recommended:<br /> To Young Adults and to all Fantasy loversYoung Adults and to all Fantasy lovers
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|This is the start of one of the most amazing fantasy epics of all time.  I have read tolkien, goodkind and others but this is the BEST story full of memorable characters.  There are commoners and kings all heros and villains, some both at the same time.  It is well worth the time to read ALL the books.  Can't wait for the tenth and final book.
B003ZDZ22U|5.0|This is another really good cd by miley. There are fast and slow songs on here but mostly upbeat and fun. My daughter loves this and can't believe how good it is. If you have liked her stuff in the past you will love this. I would recomend this for any miley or hannah fan. Buy it.
B00005QGAX|5.0|Bad is definately one of my top 2 favorite MJ albums, in competition with his History Collection album! Of all the songs I only found 3 that were unoriginal to me because they were on his History album which I owned way before ever buying Bad out of Wal*mart. Those 3 songs are Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, and Man in the Mirror.      One of the biggest highlights of this album has got to be Just Good Friends! I never knew Stevie Wonder could sing so good. My mom even told me when she was growing up grandpa and ma owned his albums and would put them on and everyone would dance to them:D Thats awesome. Its strange because the only songs I ever knew by Stevie were Superstition and...well thats it. Now I know tons of his songs and even have alot of them on my MP3 player! Its also very interesting to know that Just Good Friends is based on his style of music. It and Dirty Diana are defiantely my favorite songs on this album.      Speaking of Dirty Diana I have to confess. I was never big on Rock and Roll. If anyone is to blame for why I like rock music now it would have to be Aerosmith and Prince. Dirty Diana adds to this interest in a new genre with its catchy guitar riffs and MJ's story on a golddigger who seduces him for fortune and fame. It has come to my attention by someone on youtube that Dirty Diana might be MJ's answer to Princes Darling Nikki which is also a really kicka** song. But I think the songs are too different to truelly compare.     Everyone knows Smooth Criminal from MJ's weird movie Moonwalker. Not many people know Speed Demon though. Speed Demon was a strange, but funny video in the movie Moonwalker where MJ transforms into a anamorphic rabbit and rides a motorcycle to get away from insanely crazed fans and enemies. Its a really cool song and if you like it the video makes it even better. Leave Me Alone also had a video on the movie Moonwalker. It's probably the weirdest and most surreal of the videos, but the songs holds a message. The song is basically MJ telling the annoying media hacks who made up stories of him to f*** off. Its not one of my favorite songs, but still good.     Liberian Girl and Another part of me were good songs, but didn't do too much for me.      An interesting addition to the CD are the interviews with record producer Quincy Jones who helped MJ with his Off the Wall album and the most popular album ever; Thriller. It was very interesting listening to backstory and information on the album. One thing in particular that peeked my interest is that Prince was originally ment to do a duet with Michael Jackson for Bad. I know this to be true for the Batman album as well. It would have been really awesome to hear a duet between two of the greatest men in the music industry. Other artist like whitney Houston were supposed to be on the album as well, but somehow things didn't turn out right. Between each interview track theres a song that was scrapped from the original Bad album and I see why. The best of these songs is Streetwalker which is pretty good, but compared to the songs that did make in onto the album it doesn't hold up well.     Bad is definately a must have for MJ fans everywhere. If theres any album that shows that MJ is truelly a musical genious its Bad. I also recommend his History album.
193413712X|1.0|I should have realized that the 5-star reviews were by other authors or people of that ilk.  I don't see how this book won a pulitzer, much less made it to publication.  Just a mess of jibberish and I took absolutely nothing away from it.
0385342047|3.0|I thought it was cute, but as other reviewers have said, it's a bit repetitive.  Becky never changes, and I didn't expect her to (nor did that even bother me), but I did expect a storyline that centered more around Minnie and Becky's relationship and some funny tales about motherhood.<br /><br />Something else that kind of bothered me - the story took place in late 2005/2006, yet there were several mentions of iPhones and Skype.  Wasn't the original iPhone released in early 2007?  I know Skype isn't \\"NEW,\\"  but were the British really using it so regularly in 2005 that it got a mention in this novel?  And did they have an earlier iPhone release than we did in the US?  I could be wrong, but it just bothered me that they were mentioned in a story dating back so far.  Like I said, it could just be me, but it annoyed me a bit.<br /><br />All in all, it was cute.  I'm a Shopaholic fan, and while I wouldn't want the \\"formula\\" to change too much, perhaps it is time for Becky to grow up a little bit now that she's a wife and mother.  But if Kinsella keeps writing for this series, I'll continue reading...
B002ZG99A4|4.0|The way Stallone recently brought both ROCKY and RAMBO full circle and ended those iconic film series on a good strong note with a solid note of finality was masterful.<br /><br />5 stars to both ROCKY BALBOA-2007 and JOHN RAMBO-2008<br /><br />But EXPENDABLES ?????<br /><br />Hmmmm ...<br /><br />I know it was supposed to be a sort of not-too-serious homage to the action movies of the 80s, but for some reason it did not HIT me the same way the last ROCKY and RAMBO did.<br /><br />Maybe I have reached a point in life where I can only appreciate a movie if there is some sort of deeper message I can relate to based on my own experiences.<br /><br />Perhaps I don't get excited about fireworks (literally I don't), big explosions, gunfights, fistfights and car chases like I did when I was 16 years old.<br /><br />For whatever reason, when it came to EXPENDABLES I could not help but feel that the reason there was so much hype and buzz about the movie was the very special assembled cast of big names.<br /><br />Looking at the 5 minutes of plot and 101 minutes of POW -- BOOM --- WHAM,  I can't help but feel if this exact movie had been made with any other group of actors it would have been overlooked and dismissed as just another forgettable and generic action movie.<br /><br />This movie does have a magic, but it is because of the assembled cast led by Stallone.<br />With any other random cast of actors, the movie would probably not seem as special.<br /><br />EXPENDABLES has lots of flash and energy, but not the same soul as other Stallone movies of recent years.<br /><br />In all fairness, perhaps it is not intended to be really deep.  Perhaps it is intended to be pure escapism action, action, action.<br /><br />If that is the case, the fault is not with the movie itself, but with my frame of mind or expectations I may have had following ROCKY BALBOA and JOHN RAMBO.<br />(both movies that had action but also a deeper meaningful message one can relate to).<br />Note -- I think the scene with Rocky talking to his son outside the restaurant in RB, is one of the most powerful scenes in all of Stallone's movies.<br /><br />I am a big Stallone fan.<br />I respect the guy personally and professionally.<br /><br />Tons of hard work went into making this film that must be respected.<br /><br />We watch his films like ROCKY BALBOA-2007, JOHN RAMBO-2008, Cliffhanger, Get Carter, Lock Up and others at least once per year each at our house.<br /><br />But in the case of EXPENDABLES, while we have added it to our Blu-Ray collection,  I don't think it will be viewed quite as often in the future as our other favorite Sly films.<br /><br />It may just be my tastes changing as I get older that has effected my feel for this particular film.<br /><br />If I shift my mind into a pure action film mentality (the same mentality I may have had 25 years ago watching Arnold's COMMANDO),  I may end up rating this movie higher...  but mentally I'm not that same young guy anymore either.<br /><br />Yeah .....  I think that is a fair analysis.<br /><br />Lastly,<br /><br />I will confess, I think I may have enjoyed the two Blu-Ray bonus feature documentaries INFERNO (the filming)  and FROM THE ASHES (post production)  as much or more than the movie itself.<br /><br />It is interesting for somebody not actively involved in the film making business to see an extensive behind the scenes look at all the work that goes into making a 90 minute film.<br /><br />Yes, we all know you need a script, screenplay, set design, wardrobe, shoot scenes, music soundtracks, editing, etc...<br /><br />We all know the basic concept of how movies are made..... but as an analogy,  there is a difference between knowing how a car works in theory and being able to build one yourself from scratch.<br /><br />The two bonus feature documentaries on the Expendables Blu-Ray go into good detail on the whole process from beginning to end.<br /><br />As good as the movie itself for me personally.
B001O2ZW1A|4.0|I've disappointed of the last 2 Porcupine Tree albums because of their terrible metal hiper-technical sound, but I've found some kind of reward in SW's side and solo projects, falling in love with both Blackfield works and now tasting this beautiful strongly Pink Floyd influenced new work. It's like a sort of homecoming, after a long tortuous trip inside his own mind, giving a chance to its most psichedelic and inmost side.
0800141660|5.0|This particular movie is one I have watched over and over. I don't ever get tired of this version. I have seen others and they didn't have the cast that made this edition so wonderful. It's a movie for years of entertainment and just joyful to watch. It's funny, poignant, sad and best of all, happy endings!!!!
B004BSIJ9Q|2.0|More like some twisted shhhhh mess LOL! Come on Kanye, what happened to that Boom-Bap album you was telling Premo you were gonna make? Premo was right! you side tracked and was thinking about the masses and did some more auto tunes shhhhhhhh! This album sounds like a techno club album LMAO. Make up your mind whether your gonna do real Hip-hop or club music.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I haven't received this yet; but have seen the movie so many times, I lost count. One of the best classics ever and I never get tired of watching it. I actually had this copy a few years ago and lost it during a move. I love the music and all the original actors. Can never go wrong with such a great musical!!!
B0044XV3QY|3.0|Great movie but when you factor it wont play on a lot of players even if they are updated to current firmware and that disks get scratches easy in their cardboard pull out sleeves its not worth more than about 15$.  Disks are loose with nothing securing them from sliding.  For me 2 out of our 3 players wouldnt work, I keep my units up to date with latest updates from manufacturers.  The one that does play it loads slooooooooow, most disks load in 15 seconds, this one takes several mins.  Studio is trying to rake in the money with a triple release: incomplete first release with no extras, current release poorly implemented very bad packaging except for the outer keep case, and a 3rd 3D release.  Disks are not secure in the packaging and can easily be scratched.  A cheap CD pouch would work but why not make good packaging for the consumer up front?  Maybe Fox will do another release down the line that corrects some of these problems. I hope that the manufacturer pays attention to the high number of negative reviews on Amazon.  As far as Blu-ray its a shame the studios didnt see the merits of HD-DVD disks which load much faster and look just as good.  Players are finally reasonable but with the disk issues and disclaimer that comes with many current releases its just sad. Consumers shouldn't have to wonder whether a disk they buy at the store will play on their unit.  You should be able to buy a player that will work period, this is why DVD sales are still strong and Bluray is only slowly being adopted.<br /><br />I have changed my rating on this review from 1 to 3 stars due to the fact that the movie itself is fantastic.  Image quality is gorgeous and this is a sci-fi must have film.  As long as you take care of the disks by keeping them in a seperate DVD pouch you can keep them functioning.  Implementation of this release and the way the Blu-ray disks are stored deserves only 1 star, however due to this being a rich movie experience for anyone who loves Sci-Fi to be fair it balances out a little.<br /><br />My recomedation is to buy this one used on Ebay and keep your disks safe in a DVD/bluray pouch.  It would be nice if they recalled the packaging and gave everyone a descent case that actually protects the disk.  This case reminds me of the cardboard Wall-E case which was also horrible and falls apart.  For something that retails 50 clams thats just not right.  Just my 2 cents, wait for a steal on this one or buy second hand when the price is right.t balances out a little.

1400052173|5.0|What can I say in a review that already hasn't been said?  Henrietta Lacks died of cancer in 1951.  Her cancer cells were harvested and became the origin of a cell line - HeLa cells - that wouldn't die in the lab.  Today, HeLa cells are used world-wide in biomedical research.<br /><br />This happened without telling the family.  And when the family was told, no one bothered to explain the science of cell biology.  They once believed that their wife and mother, or at least parts of her, was still alive in a laboratory, subject to the most terrifying experiments, from radiation exposure to weightlessness in space to AIDS research.<br /><br />Author Rebecca Skloot tells two stories in The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.  She tells the history of Henrietta Lacks, her cells, and her family.  And Skloot also tells the story of working with the Lacks family, particularly Henrietta's daughter, Deborah.<br /><br />This tale is engaging from start to finish.  Well-written, and highly recommended.  It will become a classic, I am certain.  And I expect to see it on college reading lists for decades to come.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|This is definitely Groban's best album. His voice has never sounded better and the style of song is age/life experiences appropriate. Most of the material is Josh's own, which means he is very connected to it. I wish, however, that the lyrics were a bit more sophisticated. A few of the songs are mundane. Hopefully his poetry will progress as much as his voice has! Great job!
B002TLSSXO|5.0|Never thought I would ever be excited by utensils, but these are great!  The quality of the utensils is very high, the colors are adorable and the design of having them elevated so they do not mess up your counters is brilliant and well executed.  Have already bought other sets to send as gifts.

B002RWKSII|5.0|Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin<br />By David M. Beard<br />Editor and Publisher of Endless Summer Quarterly; The World's Leading Brian Wilson/Beach Boys Publication<br /><br />There was 2004's majestic Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE, then 2008's colorful That Lucky Old Sun - both evocative collections in Wilson's catalogue. Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin is an album that is something else altogether; in touching Gershwin's venerable catalogue, Wilson has taken his own unique approach to composing and has actually made Gershwin his own. The result? Wilson's career-defining best.<br /><br />In addition to his role in the band as a vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, Paul Von Mertens assisted Wilson with song selection as well as arrangements and orchestrations. When I asked Mertens about the album, he submitted, \\"Many of these songs are so familiar that they've been played beyond the point of boredom. They've been played into the ground and sort of lost their spark. I'll give you one example: `Summertime'; almost nobody sings the melody correctly the way it was originally written. They take away some of the interesting chromaticism that's in the melody that Gershwin wrote and turn it into a Blues song. What Brian did was - with almost all these songs - return faithfully to the original melody, which is kind of a big deal because a lot of people have been singing and playing these songs incorrectly and the casual (loungy) versions of these songs have become the norm. Hearing the songs done correctly is kind of a revelation. I know that it sounds like good music done well. It's Brian and Gershwin done with a lot of care.\\"<br /><br />The attention to detail in the arrangements of \\"Summertime,\\" \\"Our Love Is Here To Stay\\" and \\"I Loves You Porgy\\" (sung from the original female perspective), and the wonderfully unexpected adaptations of \\"'S Wonderful,\\" \\"I Got Plenty O' Nuttin',\\" \\"I Got Rhythm\\" and \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" make Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin a brilliant assemblage of fully realized songs that are as good as anything available in music today. When asked about his reimagining of \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" Brian said, \\"Well, `Little Deuce Coupe' was like (begins scat singing) - I took it from `Little Deuce Coupe.'  I wanted it to have that `Little Deuce Coupe' kind of Beach Boy feeling.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the song selection is the full realization of two previously incomplete Gershwin recordings, \\"The Like in I Love You\\" and \\"Nothing But Love.\\" The Gershwin Estate had someone take all this music that was in written form and record very basic piano performances of the songs, so Brian listened to solo piano recordings that were just realizations of the chords and melody of the fragments. Band member Scott Bennett returned to the role of lyricist (That Lucky Old Sun) on the two songs, but the two tracks came together very differently. Mertens explains, \\"For `The Like in I Love You' I used a piano improvisation that I recorded while Brian was noodling around after soundcheck on the piano. I was kind of following him around while we were on tour with his knowledge and permission, because he liked to play piano after dinner (and before the gig) up on the stage. I said, `Would it be okay if I just record some of the stuff that you do, and if you have any Gershwinny [sic] ideas we'll take 'em down?' Brian said, `Okay.' That vocal intro is something that he was playing on the piano and I transcribed it and suggested that it might make a good intro for this Gershwin song that he chose; it was in the key of E-flat. I wrote a chart for the Gershwin song with just the chord changes, the band recorded a basic rhythm track and then Brian sang a new melody for it. We tracked the parts that Brian liked and then he created a new melody for it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Nothing But Love\\" was also from a piano rendition, but went through a different process. Mertens expains, \\"That was one of the songsthat Brian had selected based on the solo piano version of it. Darian (Sahanaja) recorded a waltz-time version instrumental demo of that song and had Brian listen to it and we recorded it. Brian created a new melody in Darian's waltz-time version of it and somehow it was just not making it and Brian started to feel strongly that the fact that it was a waltz was getting in the way for him. He said, `I don't do waltzes... It's not workin'.' We had a lovely song so we decided to: 1) lower the key, and take it down a step; 2) If it's hard to sing in three let's just rock it. `Nothing But Love' was really the only song that didn't come to life almost instantly. It wasn't until we did it as a rock song that suddenly everyone's eyes lit up and we were like... `Okay, this is gonna work!'\\"<br /><br />Of the 14-track album Wilson says, \\"If you take it one by one, each song has a different personality and a different texture and different rhythm, and different sound. And each lead, how you have to handle the lead, the way you really feel it - and the way you think George would have liked to have heard it... I squared it away until it sounded like Brian Wilson and Gershwin together.\\"<br /><br />Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin brings together the sounds of The Beach Boys, George and Ira Gershwin, Jazz, R&B - all the great music that came out of Tin Pan Alley.  This collection is for the fan, but it's also for the uninitiated. There is something for everyone to appreciate... including Brian Wilson.  For under the \\"Special Thanks\\" in the album's liner notes Wilson wrote: To George and Ira Gershwin for creating music that inspired a young boy from Hawthorne, California to follow a dream.

1400067936|4.0|I have just finished reading the book, and the two ideas I remember the best from it are that we often take noise to be meaning (=signal) and that we are not as rational as we think we are. Taleb imagines many plausible scenarios where luck is mistaken for skill, or in general noise is mistaken for signal. Also, we have naturally bad intuition for understanding randomness and for calculating probabilities. Maybe the most important mistake we make with probability is thinking just of what event is most likely, instead of the expectation. Taleb gives the example on p. 98 of a game with 999 chances out of 1000 of making $1 and 1 chance out of 1000 of losing $10000. The most likely event is to make a dollar, but this is still a bad game to play!     Another point that Taleb makes often in the book is that humans are more strongly affected by a loss than an equal sized gain, and more strongly affected by many small gains than one big gain. These are not just thought games, rather they are statements about human psychology that could be tested, and in the notes to the book Taleb references a number of works in behavioral economics that might substantiate these claims.    Taleb is especially hostile to business journalists, and calls them his bête noire (p. 58). As I remember, he argues in many places that journalists increase noise and also give interpretations of noise that make this noise look meaningful. This point made a big impact on me because it is something I have felt myself but hadn't heard other people talk about before: at the end of a trading day with a small increase or decrease in a stock index, why bother giving explanations for this? The world is an immensely complicated place, and there don't always have to be understandable explanations for events. I really liked the example Taleb gave of Skinner's pigeons which made up dances when they were fed randomly, which they seem to have \\"thought\\" caused them to be fed.    We are flawed and do not always behaverationally. Taleb talks about bounded rationality which operates by satisficing, an idea of Herbert Simon, and the notion of irrational heuristics of Kahneman and Tversky. Taleb often talks about the problem of survivorship bias: to rationally evaluated a strategy, we should take into account those people who flamed out and are now out of the game. An analogy might be looking at the grades of a university class. The people who are doing the worst will have probably dropped out before the cut-off deadline and thus are not counted. See pp. 147-148.    Taleb says on p. 38 that he has noticed as a trader that \\"people do not like to insure against something abstract; the risk that merits their attention is always something vivid.\\"     The ideas in this book have been forming in Taleb's head for a long time, and one can sense his anger in some of his descriptions of lucky people and people who explain luck after the fact as skill. (He uses the word contempt on p. 131.) But this anger is not a bad thing. I like writing that has emotion behind it.    I can tell by reading this book that Taleb is a real intellectual. Readers could be intimidated by his learning, and might feel defensive about their own intelligence and therefore hostile towards him. The only time I have heard Cavafi quoted before is by Kenneth Clark in the first episode of his documentary series \\"Civilisation\\", however Clark does not have the sharp edges that Taleb has and seems friendlier with his learning than Taleb does. I myself believe that we should value learning for itself and I have disdain for people who don't try to better themselves, but I sometimes felt in reading the book that Taleb would call me an illiterate peasant for not having read the Iliad in the original Greek.
B003XKAZKO|5.0|Yeah the packaging for the \\"Bona Drag\\" reissue is lame, but the music sounds amazing!  Now please remaster \\"Kill Uncle\\" !
B003EYVY04|2.0|What exactly is so \\"Ultimate\\" about these editions?  They don't contain the extended versions of the movie... just a bunch of silly cards and a mildly-amusing booklet with some stills.  There's a couple \\"bonus discs\\" of extra content but all of the content could easily have fit on one extra disc... with room to spare.    No director's commentary, no real effort was put into this. Even the \\"Marauder's Map\\" screen saver is just a twitty little add-on that your kid could do in about 10 minutes... just advertising for the film and a few stills.    I was quite stoked about these editions but now that I have them, I'm wondering why I bothered.
0385338686|4.0|Well, this book was one of the three choices for our February book club book, and do I ever wish that we had chosen this one over _The Godmother_! Not that this was by any means a \\"serious\\" novel, no, it was a typical British Chick Lit sort of book - a little silly, and a lot of fun to read! There were definitely some laugh-out-loud parts to this, that made me wish that there was a movie-version to see with friends. The plot was at times a bit stressful, but overall it was just a lot of fun to read and made for a satisfying way to spend my evening.
B000JQOIJY|4.0|Happy with the product. However, in the description it said that the disk had no scratches just minor bends on the case corners. I played the disk and found that there are minor scratches, causing quick skips in a few songs.
0061537934|3.0|I enjoyed this book - but then, I usually enjoy books told from a dog's P.O.V. As a dog owner, I am definitely the target audience for these type of books! The added car racing stuff certainly gave this book a unique twist, but as a non-car-racing fan, much of that was rather lost on me. I wish that Stein had balanced out his book with some more light-hearted material - ultimately, this was a very depressing book, which was rather unusual for a book from a dog's P.O.V. Some of it felt out of the scope of a canine P.O.V., which was loosely explained by the dog's love of television... but I found that to be a rather weak way of cheating the limitations set by the P.O.V. Overall, however, it was hard to put down, but it would not be a dog-story that I strongly recommend to other dog-book-lovers.
0061729078|3.0|I was disappointed to learn the book was written in 1963 (the year the author died!). Apparently his estate renewed the copyright at a much later date.

B0011ZNAIC|4.0|Wow, the reviews for this movie are brutal, and I'm not sure that I understand why...I watched it with my son and we both laughed - granted, it isn't accurate, and is completely implausible, but do toys really come to life when humans aren't around, as in the greatest kids' movies ever, the Toy Story trilogy? The plot to \\"Bee\\" has been so detailed over the last three years of reviews that I won't go into it, but I will say that little kids are not going to notice if the bees' stripes are correctly animated, etc. I also completely agree that this is never going to be a classic, and it's not roll in the aisle hilarious (although even my son liked the cameos by the singer Sting and Ray Liotta, an actor whose work he's seen on the old 'Just Shoot Me' series) - and yes, it did occur to me, as an adult, that Seinfeld was cribbing a little bit from Woody Allen and \\"Antz\\". But again, we keep coming back to...Do any of these things matter to a five or six year old? Nope, they're just going to laugh at Barry The Bee and his adventures, and here is where I'll personalize the review for a moment: My son is learning disabled, and so I actually don't mind when a movie gets something wrong, so that we can get into \\"By the way, a bee REALLY...\\" stuff. In closing, we watched it, my son asked for the DVD (which I am ordering right now), and I do think that there's an audience out there for this movie. Thanks for reading my opinion! =)
1439107955|5.0|The unfolding `biography' of Cancer by Siddhartha Mukherjee reads more like a great mystery novel than scientific research .   In its scope and depth it is a magisterial opus in the best of the Renaissance traditions; erudite, elucidating, enlightening and in the final pages -  transformative.     The Epilogue - a genuine Tour de Force, recapitulates through time and space the geography of cancer, the whole journey- over  5000 years  old,  of the different stages of Cancer advances and  intervention  seen through  the prism of  Atossa, Queen of Persia, as a case study.   In the process of doing so, we gain new and deeper insight into the inextricably embedded nature  of  Cancer, not only as foreign invasive force but in more intricate and complex way woven into our genetic makeup of us as a human .      Most unexpectedly and brilliantly  narrated,  the last pages of this epic story, draw us , without warning , into a  hospital  room in Boston,  where Germaine Berne faces her  final heroic  battle with Emperor of all Maladies.    In his final reflection on Germaine,  Sid Mukehrjee  beautifully captures the essence of the human spirit.    A must read.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in YEARS and I'd honestly forgotten about it until recently. When I was a kid around 6-8 years old, I absolutely wore this movie OUT! I literally wore out the VHS copy I had. I haven't seen it since the last time I watched that VHS tape, but I can't wait to receive it in the mail so I can sit down and watch it again. In retrospect, it really isn't a movie for kids. Its pretty warped and kind of trippy, but that's what makes it such a beautiful piece of art! I wouldn't recommend it for kids, but it is DEFINITELY one I would recommend to everybody over the age of about 10 or 12!
1401307957|5.0|I don't like to throw around the word \\"inspire\\", but that is exactly what this book is, Inspiring and entertaining. I love art but never thought I could or should even try at my age, \\"cough 40 something\\", to learn. Recently I began to think why not? Like anything else just try and learn. I mistakenly thought that I'm sure like others, that this type of talent should be innate. Well I'm practicing and learning everyday and when I found this book it just helped me to say to myself, \\"see it can be done, I can learn to draw even at my age\\"!
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|they should have stopped at the first movie. i always loved S&TC but they have taken it a step too far. i could barely stand to watch the movie. i love the series and characters but there was nothing of substance or drawing me into this film at all. i could not see myself watching this movie again.
0307454541|1.0|I would have to go some to think of a book that I struggled with for so long, hoping I would hit the part \\"where it becomes interesting\\".  I kept going, because of the best seller status it has enjoyed.  It was even recommended to me by one of the most voracious readers I work with.<br /><br />This is a 600-page book that could have been easily cut to 300 pages.  My first clue should have been the family tree inside the cover and the amount of people in it.  The fact is, most of the details about the entire family have all but nothing to do with the main plot.  More examples of page-filling, extraneous details are the description that seems to go on forever of the retired detective.  OK, so he was in charge of the case, retired and never got it out of his mind.  We get the point.  Then there are details about the woman that runs the small coffee shop, the master computer wizard/hacker that Lisbeth interracts with.......on and on it goes, mind-numbingly unimportant to the main story.<br /><br />It is a sexually violent and disturbing story.  If that's not your thing, skip this book.<br /><br />I got to page 477, looked at my companion across the room, and said \\"do you think I can hit the trash can from here?\\" and hurled it.  I did not care, at that point, who killed Harriet, who didn't, who slept with who, who was going to end up together, why, or how.<br /><br />I should not have wasted my time.  I cannot understand the enthusiasm for this book.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I have just finished watching the entire season of lost again. And I will say once again it was one of the best shows ever with one of the best endings ever. It did not dissapoint me. Thank you to every one involved, it will be a long time before a show this good comes along.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Yo, I can't for the life of me understand how anyone can say anything negative about New Amerykah.  I'm playing this album (track 3 - Me) through my Grado SR325is right now.  Are you serious?  How can you not hear the genius in this work?  You were expecting a Lil' Wayne + Lil' Zane duet?  Open your mind. An open mind opens eyes so you can see, and opens ears so you can hear.  Ears love candy.  New Amerykah is the fix.  No match for your senses.  Marinate on this album for an ounce of infinity.  Then check back to see if your sanity has returned.  If you agree say yessireeeee...
4770031246|5.0|Amazing book, highly recommended. It's better, even, than I expected, as a fan of the justbento.com and justhungry.com sites. Most dishes have an element of meat, but this book is very suitable for vegetarians. It's the kind of book that gives you a main recipe and bunch of delicious variations and/or alternatives, which helps keep things interesting while also getting you familiar with making your own combinations and variations. Brilliant stuff.    The recipes themselves are delicious and easy to make. This is my go-to book for weeknight Japanese food, too, for recipes and inspiration.

B001KO8ISG|3.0|Previous poster said this was as good as X Files.  SOmetimes I think it is better because it has much richer character development.  Without a doubt, the stories told her are better than almost anything I'm seeing on TV today.  My only wish is that they'd continue beyond the 10th year and actually have a series where Clark Kent has fully embraced his role as Superman and we see more development of his relationship with Lois Lane.  edited 16 Jan 2011: I didn't like Lois in this portrayal.  I thought it started off well with them being thrown into the Phantom Zone but I really wanted her to question Clark more about what was going on.  I wanted her to ask the tough questions and I really wanted to see him being more protective of her.  I didn't feel it in this episode.  Nonetheless, he is the one that takes actions to save her.  But, I didn't like that Lois was taken over by one of the phantoms.   It was just awkward. Her portrayal...the way she looked was just awkward.  NOt my favorite Lois moment.
B002VECM6S|3.0|I couldn't get anyone to see this movie with me, but somehow over the awards season months I picked up the idea that it was really a great great movie that anyone would like.  Finally it popped up on HBO and my wife and I sat down to watch it.<br /><br />After it was over we sat there staring at the blank screen and wondering what on earth was the fuss about and how on earth did Sandra Bullock win the Oscar for this?  The Proposal was better for heaven's sake, was that the name of the movie where she was Canadian and had to marry Ryan Reynolds to stay in this country?  Anyhow, I love a good football picture but this one made Michael Oher seem like an idiot, until the Touhys groomed him for football and university life, and apparently taught him to rap too.<br /><br />The main actor Quinton Aaron has a faint vestige of a personality. which the director must have thought suited the character well, for he varies it only slightly.  The rest of the cast, including Sandra Bullock, is fine, even Kathy Bates.  Well, the one actor I couldn't stand was the little boy, Jae Head, who just got more annoying in every scene.  Little Jae Head was good in Friday Night Lights, where he played a fatherless kid whom Tim Riggins took pity on early on in the series...  but here he's been directed to talk like Mickey Rooney on speed.  I hesitate to state here that I don't like little S.J. because people will think I don't like family movies about Republican Christians, because I do.  You can check out hundreds of my other reviews of family films to prove it.  Now also what was with THE BLIND SIDE seeding its cast with people we loved on FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS?  Now that's smart casting!  Puts you in a good mood, until the general vapidity of the movie sinks in like a enema of milk and honey.
B0047G028I|5.0|When I saw this episode...it took my breath away.  It is the most perfect episode I've ever watched on TV.  I don't know how to describe it other than to say...pure perfection.  If there was anything I didn't like about it...it was that it ended because I could have watched more of the same.  This is a series that should not be missed.  What's amazing about this...is that their 100th episode was just as perfect.  For those people who think...ah...this is just a silly show about Superman and the comic book figures he fights...Stop...you're wrong.  This is a character driven show as much as it is a plot driven show.  The producers/writer's have done the rare thing of combining great storytelling on a weekly basis with great/rich characters that you can love/hate.  You see the best of the best (Clark Kent) and the worst of the worst (Lex Luthor) and some people in between. Don't miss this perfection!
B000002KIK|4.0|No matter that this has a reputation for being one of Sabbath's weakest albums -- I think it's a classic.  It's a definite step forward from \\"Technical Ecstasy,\\" and I personally like it even better than \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.\\"  It's that good.  It's more straightforward raw, driving hard rock than either of those two releases.  The production, especially on Bill Ward's drums, has that raw, organic basement level quality that makes the material very real and in your face.  And Ozzy, in his final performance with the band, is at his peak here.  No one sings as emotively as he did and no one ever will again.  Iommi's riffs are electrifying (to quote the liner notes to the Warner Bros. CD version) as always.  Finally, I love the keyboard effects to be found in songs like \\"Johnny Blade.\\"  They have a trippy, drug-induced late '70s vibe that could never be reproduced.<br /><br />There are actually only two songs here that I don't feel are up to Sabbath standards (hence the four star rating) and they are the last two, one an instrumental complete with a saxophone that I felt was a bit much and the other being one with Bill Ward singing, which while not being terrible, pales in comparison to the rest.<br /><br />Still, as a whole this album is absolutely essential to any Sabbath collection with its trademark rawness that was, I believe, a precursor to the New Wave of British Heavy Metal that would explode elsewhere in England in the couple years after this.  Again, a brilliant album.

I adored the idea of this book more then any other book I have read, the idea, the fact Katniss and Peeta had to fake their love but in the end you could start to tell they were falling hard for each other. It was adorable I loved this book and I cannot wait to start the next one.<br />Go Suzanne Collins!
B000F39MAG|5.0|Hence, I begin this review with the said title. Prior to watching this phenomenal production of Roberto Devereux on DVD, I have watched the major scenes from Youtube and was, once and for all, changed for life. Catharsis, if one may call it. I have been listening to opera (mostly Mozart, Haydn, Cherubini, some Wagner, Berg and  pre-bel canto composers like Mehul and Spontini) for a number of years but strangely it was not until the recent phenomenon of social media that thankfully, exposed me to a far greater range of bel canto operas than I previously thought imaginable. Donizetti's Lucia used to be my only world. Now, Devereux has become the universe.    Devereux enthusiasts familiar with Sills' legendary production (both studio and on-stage) would incontrovertibly entertain reservations with Loy's groundbreaking version of the opera. Drawing parallels with the modern world, it is a production that plays on the symbolic, while also having the benefit of focusing on singing, facial expression, use of space, movement and interaction between acting singers. As someone who did not grow up with earlier productions of Devereux, I find myself particularly drawn towards Loy's liberating conception, as it has a peculiar, psychological intensity which I do not find in the more 'traditional' or period-set productions.    Particularly well-made was 'behind-the-scenes', with each interview bringing a unique perspective to the opera and its produciton values. Nothing was left to chance or a moment of whim and fancy - meticulous work was in place, be it the singers, the backstage or camera crew. Nine cameras were employed to capture the entire performance, and from the interview with the video crew chief, it is apparent that he relishes a wealth of experience filming opera as well as a particular love and admiration for Donizetti's arguably greatest masterpiece.    From the interviews, conductor Haider (who was also the conductor of the studio recording made in the 90s) and thelead singers shared intelligent insights on their roles, the roles of their counterparts as well as the opera. Little wonder that the wealth of experience that they brought with them into this seminal production made it a success.    The downplay of bright and piquant colours for a solemn palette likened the cold corporate world to the dramatic intensity and sombreness of the Queen's regime. The final scene is almost black, heightening the sobriety of the atmosphere and the psychological desperation of the characters involved.    The character who brings 'life' to the drama is none other than Elizabeth I and Gruberova trumps with the psychological intensity and sophistication of her interpretation. Whereas singers hitherto had the comfort of 'hiding' behind thick powdered make-up and regalia to focus on belting out the singing, this modern adapation has turned the tables that forces the singer to enunciate the diction, melodic lines and the facial cues more expressively. Gruberova, with her wealth of experience in the role, is more than aware of the change and makes what seems necessary become an art that gives a new dimension to the role - a neurotic, delusional queen that struggles between reason and emotion, power and submission.    Now to the singing. Much has been spilt over Gruberova's vocal decline, but it is more of a speculated myth than an established truth with this production. In the almost apocalyptic finale, she holds the final high D for a near 10 seconds, with no sign of faltering in intensity. Even her studio recording made more than a decade ago did not cut that. A truly astonishing feat and nothing short of a miracle. The finale scene here is exceedingly gripping; my eyes steadily welling with tears, from the opening orchestral prologue that seems to echo an eternal sigh ('un sospiro', in Italian, finally spelt out in the libretto of the succeeding aria) with its plaintive woodwinds and bass harmony.      The tempo of the earth-shattering finale'scoda veers on the fast side, aptly so as it shakes off the poised but weary grandeur (and languor) of those lavish productions that have come to define Devereux for the past two or three decades.     The final aria-cabaletta, one that could very well be crowned the Last Aria of the World, 'Quel sangue', never fails to bring a shudder of pathos and welling of tears whenever I watch and hear it. Gruberova has certainly added a new dimension to the portrayal and stretched the psyche of Elisabetta's character; a character that is the supreme achievement of Donizetti's genius; a genius as such that is able to amalgamate the seemingly paradoxical human condition of abject disillusionment and delusion with relentless strength and resilience of the spirit that, continues to be testimony to the phenomenal power of great music.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Okay, before anyone bites my head off, I'm putting it out there that I watched this movie for the fun factor. I didn't expect it to be scary or realistic. If I wanted that, I would watch 30 days of Night again.<br /><br />Given my expectations, I wasn't disappointed with Zombieland. It was funny and Woody Harrelson was awesome.  He was perfect for this role. Jesse Eisenberg was the classic nerd. I also thought that the zombies in this movie made sense.  They weren't corpses who dug themselves from the ground but actual people who were infected with a virus. Blood and guts don't really bother me but kids who get scared easily should not watch this.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I recently purchased the sonic screwdriver because a group of my friends and I were dressing up as Dr. Who for Halloween. Being that this is one of the only options on the market, I bought this particular screwdriver because I wanted it to light up and make noise. I am satisfied.<br /><br />There are a few problems:<br />1. The nibs that you can remove off the end don't secure very well. As a matter of fact, the interchangeable UV nib wouldn't even attach straight out of the packaging.<br />2. The UV nib never worked. The light is a blacklight, so I'm assuming the UV ink was dried up. Dunno.<br />3. It seems kind of fragile. I wouldn't recommend buying it as a children's toy.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I watched the video with an 10 year old and a 8 year old and they both showed laughter and enjoyment.I would get this video without question.
1416585710|5.0|It's pretty clear to me from the number of reviewers who rated this book with five stars (166) versus the number of those who gave it one star (115, I believe), and the number of reviewers who gave it middling grades (double-digit numbers for 2, 3, 4, stars etc.), that this is a love-it-or-hate-it book.    Lisey's Story is one of my absolute favorite books.      I can see how this can be a pretty hard book for people to like if they're put off by the \\"inner language\\" of Scott and Lisey Landon.  I, for one, loved it.  Another reviewer called it all \\"baby talk,\\" and I really think he was missing the point.  On the surface, some of the words like \\"gunky,\\" \\"babyluv,\\" etc. might seem banal, but when you consider some of the different driving forces in the story (Scott's very disturbing childhood, his love for his brother Paul), you see how loaded a lot of those silly-sounding words are.  Also, any couple who loves each other deeply and has been together for a while develops their own secret language.  ESPECIALLY if one of them is skilled with words in the first place (like, perhaps, a Pulitzer prize-winning author like the one described in the book?) To me, it added much realism.     I encourage anyone who's looking for a new kind of monster to scare them, or a new kind of love story, to read this book.  This isn't your tween daughter's newest Twilight clone.  This isn't a typical love story.     I will admit, the book does start slow.  It took me a little bit to get into it, but once I did, it got under my skin and never left.  I know a book is excellent when I think about it long after I've read it.    I'm not going to do a synopsis of this book (it's been too long since I've read it to remember exact plot lines and whatnot), but I will say that anyone who wants to try reading this NEEDS TO READ IT TO THE END in order to make a definite judgment about this book.
B001N26GFM|4.0|The DVD arrived as stated. I have not watched it yet but everyone says it is a very moving film so I am looking forward to watching it (with hankies Ive been advised)
B004132HZS|1.0|Well, I have to say, I didn't like this. I am a HUGE fan of the original books and the new movie, but for me, one of the things that made it so special for me was that Holmes and Watson could do the extraordinary things that they did WITHOUT the help of laptops or cellphones or other gadgets. So this really disappointed me.
B001HN694K|5.0|Alice in Wonderland is a splendid movie by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp as the mad hatter, and Mia Masikowska as Alice. The special effects are amazing and the storyline is very well-written. The music is effective and overall it is a movie that I very much liked to watch. Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter also play their parts to perfection. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
B001OQCV6K|1.0|Another poor quality blu-ray DVD put out by Warner.  So what is the excuse this time - the film negative from 2009 is poor quality.  The picture quality is below that of a regular DVD - this certainly is not HD.  Problems include grain and picture fuzz, ghosting and bleeding.  Do not buy any blu-ray DVDs put out by Warner.[[ASIN:B001KVZ6LQ King Kong [Blu-ray Book]]]
B003LWN8F8|5.0|I loved it! This whole album is awesome! My favorite songs are Are You Satisfied?, Shampaign, and Numb! :) All the songs are great. This album is definitely worth buying! Give it a listen. ;)
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I have read a lot of zombie books and this one is a keeper. Read it at night it would be a lot more fun that way.
B004CA2HVE|5.0|I did not think I was going to like this album, I was feeling brave so I downloaded it anyway. To my surprise I like every track, I was not a fan of the song \\"Monster\\" from listening to it on the radio, but in the context of the entire album it is a likable song. All of the tracks are reflective in a good way. The emotion from Kanye (not in a sappy way) in every track is evident including the contributing artist like The RZA, Pusha T, etc. A great rap album, the tracks have a great beat and story. Kanye's skills as a producer shine, a far cry from 808's and Heartbreaks. I highly recommend downloading this album if you are a fan of Rap/Hip Hip.
0740748475|5.0|If you have never read Calvin and Hobbes, please start now and get this complete series of them. Calvin is the most interesting and almost typical crazy 5 year old boy, going through the struggles of every day life with his trusty friend and stuffed tiger Hobbes. Girls have cooties, Dinosaurs rule the world, and come to life while he is in his rocket ship. And the only girl Suzie, I believe her name is, who even tries to be his friend winds up getting frustrated and letting him know how things are.    I must say, despite the writer, Watterson, having become a recluse, these books have been the best thing since the Peanuts comics. Most of us have had a stuffed animal talk to us, and that is why this strip of a brilliant and hilarious calibor has stood the test of time. I happened to get mine at Sam's Club for $89.99, anddespite the heavy price even its better than the original $150 price point. If you are thinking about this wonderful and complete set of Calvin and Hobbes, please by all means buy this set. Everything is in full color, like in the sunday comics, and the print is a litttle bigger then the sunday comics as well as the individual books from the past. I read a little every day, to get that extra laugh we all need through the week, and Calvin and Hobbes does that for me.     Worth the price, and has a lifetime of entertainment and is definately for the whole family.
B003NFM3JK|3.0|Its a decent movie....for adults. I have a 7 year old who has seen all of the pirates of the carabean movies and was not scared by them but I will not let him watch this one, its to scary.
B002ZG9788|4.0|This was a good remake -- I liked it better than the original -- but it was still short on story. The special effects were great, the cast was fantastic, and the acting was great. However, after the first 30 or so minutes, the movie sort of felt like the type of video game where you run around a little, encounter a boss fight, run around a little more, and encounter another boss fight...which is too bad. With this cast, and the special effects folks they had working on this, the film had some great potential.<br /><br />Now, that said, I can't say that I didn't like the film. I saw it at the theater, and then rented it. I liked it both times. Not enough to buy it, or see it again for a long time; but it wasn't time wasted.<br /><br />4/5 stars...solid action flick...fun, but not great.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|Great value pack for a game that never gets old, numerous worlds to explore and endless varity through the random world generator.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|I like this version of Robin Hood. It's more realistic than the others. Russell Crowe is a great actor and once again he does a great job. I recommend this dvd!
B0030LYL88|5.0|Think Blackmore's Night fused with Metallica and Queen producing the CD. Excellent. Bought it on a whim, not knowing what to expect and was thrilled. Can't wait for Pt. Two.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|Great movie! Cate Blanchett is perfect as Queen Elizabeth. If you enjoy period pieces, this movie should be part of your dvd collection.
0143118420|5.0|There are things to not like about this memoir. The writer divorces her husband, shacks up with another man while the divorce is still being litigated, and then goes on an all expenses paid yearlong trip to Italy, India, and Indonesia to find herself, God, happiness, and the meaning of life. She cherry picks the religions of the world to create a god of her own making. But how powerful and helpful can a god of our own making be?     From an evangelical Christian perspective, the book is too me centered and contrived. But the book itself was entertaining and the people in the book were interesting. Gilbert writes well, and you feel like you are walking the streets of Italy with her as she heads for the nearest bakery, and you feel that you are on the roof of the Ashram with her in India as she reaches out to the heavens.     I have been to Bali before, so the island descriptions were welcoming and familiar, as well as the cultural differences described. So from an entertainment perspective, I am giving the book five stars because it absorbed me and finishing it was like coming out of a different world, an experience I enjoy immensely.
B002WYH5N2|5.0|I really enjoy period pieces. This version of Pride and Prejudice is the best in my opinion. Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen are perfect as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. This two-disc collection is a nice option to purchase the movie.
B000YB4G32|5.0|IN the interests of full disclosure, this is the sole Killers album I own, so I am, by no means, an expert on their discography.  However, with that aside, The Killers on this album do not disappoint.  The remixes are artfully done, and, owning them both, I would say the Abbey Road Version of \\"Sam's Town\\" is far superior to the original.  Other highlights of the album are \\"Daddy's Eyes\\" which burns with dark, unbridled passion, and \\"Leave The Bourbon on The Shelf\\" is a fantastic song combining multiple aspects of country with the synthetic rock The Killers embrace so well.  \\"Where The White Boys Dance\\" also does not disappoint, showing Mr. Flowers' vocal range and flexibility.<br /><br />Overall, one would be highly remiss to skip this album, as it shows the true artistic talent of the Killers.  One cannot judge an artis by his masterpiece, but by his wastebasket.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Great continuation! The effects and action scenes are great. If you enjoy the Marvel universe, this dvd should be part of your collection.
0060012234|3.0|Russel Middlebrook believes that he is the only gay teenager at his High School. However, he finds that a popular baseball player, Kevin, is also gay and there are more than just a few gay teenagers at his High School. In an attempt to share secret struggles and find new friends, they create a school group under the title of The Geography Club. At the same time, Russel helps out his friend by going on a double date with a girl. Believing that this would only be a one time thing, Russel feels pressure by his friend to go on another double date. Russel also joins the school's baseball team, secretly to be close to Kevin, but finds he is actually quite good and even wins his first game for the team. Soon after Russel's new found popularity a rumor is spread that he is gay and has started a gay club. Not only is Russel's popularity in jeopardy, but so are old and new friendships, as well as his secret of being gay.<br /><br />It was very refreshing to read a novel by a male and the main character is male. This does not seem to be very common to do this in young adult literature. However, this book was very disappointing. I came into this book with high hopes but found the characters to be a bit flat. For example, Russel states that he is struggling as a gay teenager but the conflicting and painful emotion was very absent. It would have been nice to read more about Russel's feelings and struggles. However, as this is the first book in a series, I will read the next book(s), The Order of the Poison Oak, to see how Hartinger grows as an author, as he himself is a Gay author.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I'm a big fan of period movies. Pride and Prejudice is a classic. This restored edition has a great picture and sound quality. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are perfect as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. I recommend!
145150506X|5.0|Edgar Allan Poe is one of my daughter's favorite authors.  With many stories by the famous author, from \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\"I recommend this to any Poe fan.  Also great for a gift.
B001QGRIO8|5.0|Deeply satisfying on all levels!  I started off screening this series for my daughter and fell in love with the books myself.  Putting them down was not even an option!  Once I picked the book up, it held me in its beautiful caress until the end.
1439133948|5.0|Anybook, that upon completion I start over again is a well written story. Was it the best in the series? Who knows. The one thing I do know is that I did like revisting Raven Durona, I especially enjoyed that it was a nice long vist. :D
B00008972S|5.0|Contains the original screenplay as well as a lot of other really interesting memorabilia. Good sound and picture quality too.
0316098337|4.0|I have to say that this is truly an incredible read.  I would honestly rank it among the types of books one would read as a college English Lit major.  When I looked to see what the reviews were after reading it, I was so surprised to see that so many gave this 1's.  I personally give it a 4 and here's why.    I think the author truly captured the perspective of a 5-year-old and how they would take in their world.  Currently having a 5-year-old myself, I completely find the character believable.    The storyline is gripping being both heart warming and wrenching, along with bittersweet, traumatizing, beautiful, hopeful and cathartic.    Some people had difficulty with the language and I think one actually said \\"do five-year-olds really talk that way?\\"  The answer: some do, especially if they have a mother who's been through an incredible emotional trauma as Jack's mother had.  I think the language used was appropriate and added to the overall feel the book was trying to portray.    Another comment was that Jack went from being very simple to having deep, profound thoughts.  Guess what?  Kids have a tendency to be that way.  I can remember a time when my nephew, all of 4-years-old, came right up to me and asked if I believed in God.  I broke my answer down in very simple terms so that he could understand it, but the things he said back to me, which I could tell had not been spoon fed to him, were just amazing and I could not believe that we were having the conversation we had.    And yet another comment went on to say that the book didn't delve into the happenings enough (i.e. the abduction, Old Nick, etc.).  How many 5-year-olds do you know that fully grasp the gravity of everything that goes on around them?  That's part of the point.  Jack doesn't realize everything.  His world is Room and Ma and all the things they use to occupy their time.  His mother is doing the best she can to establish a \\"normal\\" for him and explain the \\"good\\" even though they are in a trulybad - very bad - situation.  The fact that Jack never really fully grasped that is amazing.    A very interesting thing I realized was that, halfway through the book, the only character's name I knew was Jack's.  There are only a couple characters whose names we really learn, showing how a kid may think of the people around them (my 5-year-old just put two and two together that my first name really isn't \\"mom\\", but that's just what he calls me).    The mother in the book is an incredible character.  The things she endures, the way she teaches her child to \\"handle\\" it, and the breakdowns she has along the way just make your heart hurt for her.  What people have to remember is that this woman was really just a child when she was taken, and virtually a child when she had him.  I think that considering the circumstances, she showed incredible strength and endurance.    I really loved the interaction Jack had with his grandmother and Steppa, especially Steppa since he's really the first positive male influence he's had.  Bronwyn sounds like she needs a few more time outs, though, and Jack himself appears to need some socialization therapy.  Again, mentioned in the book but not fully discussed, but who would discuss that with a child his age?    The one issue I had with the book was that the language was more in \\"British\\" English than \\"American\\" English even though the story took place in America.  I understand that the author is Irish and this is probably a big reason why.  I can't say I would do any better writing about something happening in Ireland.  Not a huge deal - still beautifully written - just something that kind of kept me from giving it 5 stars.  That, and the ending seemed a bit flat for me (however, not sure what I really expected). It definitely gave the reader closure, though, which I truly appreciate.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I absolutely love this book with all my heart! It is my favorite book of all time. I read it sophomore year and couldn't put it down. I higly recommend this book. The storyline is great and the characterization is wonderful.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|At first, I didn't want to read Room, even though I had heard so many good things about it. I am the mother of an almost-five-year-old and thought it would be too hard, that I would project myself too much into the mother's character and it would be too hard to bear thinking about some of the things you have to think about, reading a book like this.    It turns out that I am so glad I read this. It made me reconsider how I mother my son, how we should all parent our children, and what to be thankful for in this life. The story, as told through Jack (the five-year-old's) voice, is poignant, repellent and compelling all at the same time. Jack has the same curiosity, absolute commitment to literal meaning, and coping rationalization you see in all five-year-olds. When something doesn't make sense to him, he tries to make it make sense, in whatever way he can. I see this in my own son, and just like Ma in the book, I sometimes don't realize how much my son has understood about something until I hear him vocalize his misinterpretation of the situation or event.     I have read some other reviews that question the mother - how she \\"goes away\\" into deep depression at times during her confinement; how she acts and the choices she makes in the second half of the book. All I can say is I wish I could be the mother Ma is. She demonstrates so much patience, creativity, and concern for her child in the midst of bleak and frustrating circumstances, both in Room and in the trying situation she finds herself in later. Without giving too much away, I will say that having people question your parenting and the choices you've made for your child is one of the most maddening parts of being a parent; I can't imagine what it's like to have your choices questioned when you have gone through a harrowing ordeal and done your level best just to maintain your own sanity and that of your child. I think one of the biggest messages everyone should take from this book is that being a \\"good\\" parent means making the best choices you can at the time, given your unique set of circumstances.    This was a quick read - I finished it in a few hours - but there are so many things about the book that will stay with me for a long time. Some of Jack's observations and the way he describes things are both funny and profound at the same time. I highly recommend this book for moms. It is not gruesome or disturbing and there's no abuse of the boy involved, which was one thing I was wary of when I considered reading Room. It is a great story - one that asks a lot of questions, answers some, defers others, and overall paints an amazing picture of maternal love and human resilience.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|A hilarious children's movie in which a rat sits on a chef's head and directs him how to cook delicious meals for others! 5 stars!
B0044XV3R8|1.0|Returned this poorly packaged dvd due to major scratches.  I liked the fancy hc book style, however, the cardboard pullouts has got to go.  My 1st disk was fine, the 2nd skipped and the 3rd looked like it met sandpaper.    Say the least, I asked for a refund and will not get one until it comes out in a better package.  And, no, I did not buy the 1st release knowing it was going to be re-released in extended.  It was a given ;)
B00318COS4|5.0|I haven't played a nice game in a little while as there simply isn't anything good out there since Myst, Pharaoh, Baldur's Gate and the old Tombraider series. This one has me finally playing all night again. It's cute, nice graphics, fun, lots of not-too-easy puzzles and fun gameplay. Also, there are no long, boring dialogs, everything is explained in pictures with a nice, industrial soundtrack.<br /><br />PS I got this through Steam, not through Amazon.<br /><br />EDIT: I played it all in about 7 hours, so it's a little short... But well worth it.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! It has something for everyone in the family - sports, drama, family, inspiration...  This was such a great deal, I ordered some for Christmas gifts. They came in perfect condition & quickly.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|Someone has called \\"The American\\" a sort of modern-day western. It does have much in common with some of the classic films of that genre. There is a very real sense of impending violence and doom that permeates this film. George Clooney is great as Jack, the hitman-gunsmith who is given one last assignment before retiring. Although there is a very slow-pacing through much of the film when we just watch as things quietly unfold, often with little or no dialogue or action, this is a strength rather than a weakness. Some people have said they find the film boring and too slow. It is not Bond or Bourne but a rich character study that takes it's own time unfolding. The location filming in Sweden and Italy provide plenty of visually stunning scenery. Violante Placido is also gorgeous and she provides plenty of sizzle with several nude scenes. I may learn Italian and go back to Italy again!! One of the most unsettling aspects of this film is that you are never too sure of people or their motives. It keeps you guessing and doesn't make a real effort to explain very much. It also seems to be a departure from a typical Hollywood film and has a real European flavor.
B00122OCNQ|5.0|I was upset by the one-star review that was given to this great album by a reviewer who states that he has never heard it. Every Doors fan needs to hear this. The bonus tracks are great, too.
1439107955|5.0|This beautifully written book is not only the \\"biography of cancer\\", but also a chronicle of our fears about it. Other reviewers eloquently refer to it as \\"the monster in the closet\\" and as a \\"relentless, wily, elusive enemy\\". The book is illustrated with evocative stories of people battling cancer. Ever since \\"Love Story\\", the tragic young person (athlete, woman, child) dying of cancer has become an iconic figure in our culture, comparable to the Christian saints and martyrs of days gone by. The headscarf worn by cancer sufferers who had lost their hair through chemotherapy is an emblem of their suffering. Everyone refers to them as heroes and the word \\"brave\\" is frequently used to describe them. Yet my feeling is that they would rather have the choice not to have to be brave and not to have to be heroes, but instead have a cure or a treatment for their disease that does not require them to suffer. Our society has given cancer an iconic status, and keeps empowering the \\"monster\\" through fear. Its \\"morphic field\\" just gets bigger and bigger. What Dr. Mukherjee describes masterfully in his book is that morphic field.    Imagine this book written in the fourteenth century about the black death or in the nineteenth about tuberculosis. Six hundred and fifty years ago the black death wiped out half of Europe: 75 million people died. In the nineteenth century tuberculosis killed far more people than cancer. The plague in the fourteenth century and tuberculosis in the nineteenth were as iconic as cancer is today, the \\"disease of our generation\\". When the key to cancer is found, the monster in the closet will have a whole different face, and future generations will shake their heads at chemotherapy and radiation, the \\"primitive\\" methods their forebears used to battle this disease.    Neither Dr. Mukherjee nor his readers are likely to be aware of the 200-odd mice that have now been cured of cancer in 10 experiments at 5 different accredited university laboratories, including two medical schools. Though the cancers were known to be 100% fatal, almost all the mice in the experiments survived to full life-span cures, and when reinjected, showed immunity to the cancer. Because the means of the cure was something not recognized by either pharmaceutical companies or orthodox medicine, the researcher has been fighting an uphill battle for decades to obtain funding, laboratory access, and experimental mice. However, the experiments are real, quite inexplicable, and not yet part of the official biography of cancer.    And now Amazon has another book that offers a large ray of hope to cancer sufferers: [[ASIN:1604074310 Embrace, Release, Heal: An Empowering Guide to Talking about, Thinking about, and Treating Cancer]].
B004BC7MRM|4.0|A good album without any drunken party fluff , yeah that stuff was fun ten years ago but, we all know Kid has moved to the southern rock side of life . If you like sitting back(maybe with a cold one) and hearing some good southern style rock then grab it up .For the more country than anything review, make sure you look at what country is before you say this is country. Kid may show his Hank influence and even have Zac Brown and Martina spotlight on here, but it's blues and southern rock not country.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|When \\"monster\\" first caught my attention, I knew there was going to be a decent album coming.  I had no idea that it would be this good.  It is apparent that Kanye is continuously expanding and developing his arsenal of tools and talent. He truly has one foot out the door of the traditional hip hop box.

B001B4JVKE|4.0|I love Katie Melua, and this is a great CD. But the DVD would not play in my DVD player, or in either of my computers. Apparently it is a European type, which isn't made clear in the description (at least not for us non-electronic types). I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known, and there is no way to get my money back now that I have.
B002VECMAO|4.0|Seeing Clooney in hippie hair was classic and had me laughing in itself.  This movie is funny in an undertoned way.  I thought I wasn't going to like it from the bad critic reviews but suprisingly enough enjoyed it.  I don't like in your face funny movies and this one has an undercurrent of comedy in it.  This is a smart, funny movie movie!
1400052173|5.0|This book is written very thoughtfully.  It's interesting to hear the background and see how the family is doing now.  I would have never known about the HeLa cells if I didn't read this book, and clearly HeLa cells are very well known in the science world.
0446195529|3.0|David Baldacci has struck me as uneven in the past and \\"Hell's Corner\\" solidifies that opinion.<br /><br /> This is one of his poorer efforts.<br /><br /> Make no mistake: it is readable and is fine for a long plane trip and a couple of hotel nights.<br /><br /> But the story is just plain boring and unbelievable.<br /><br /> Oliver Stone (a/k/a John Carr) is back in the good graces of President Brennan and is commissioned to unravel an international crime syndicate. Before he can start on that project - and the prologue here does play a minor role throughout the story - he is put to work on an explosion in Lafayette Park, across from the White House and a place Baldacci fans know well.<br /><br /> Stone is paired with Mary Chapman of MI6.  Ridley Weaver, NIC Director, is more or less out to get Stone, which is nothing new. The FBI, ATF and others are all involved, but Stone feels that info is being withheld from him.<br /><br /> The story, unfortunately, becomes quickly predictable. Stone figures out something. Someone is killed. Next. There is supposed to be suspense here, but I felt it was more like slapstick. For 300 pages, the story meanders along. A shooting here, a shooting there. The members of the Camel Club are frozen out, then brought in; frozen out brought in. Stone gets in hot water - Stone gets out of hot water.<br /><br /> There's simply no suspense here.<br /><br /> The last 150 pages or so slip from one unbelievable plot twist to another.<br /><br /> If Baldacci weren't such a smooth writer, I would have set this aside before finishing. As it is, the conclusion is so dumb, that I wouldn't have missed anything.<br /><br /> A lot of people may be more forgiving of Baldacci on this outing than I am. I found \\"Hell's Corner\\" boring.<br /><br />Jerry
0316077054|5.0|Amazing, this book was simply amazing. Kami and Margie's writing styles blend together to make this irresistible southern gothic come to life.    Beautiful Darkness was my most anticipated book of 2010 and it definitely deserved that anticipation. From the very beginning of Beautiful Darkness I was hooked. The town of Gatlin and all of the characters flourished in this astounding sequel.     Lets talk some more about the characters. Liv was probably my favorite character in this book. I love people with accents so obviously she would be my favorite. Liv was definitely a good addition to the book. She is the typical know it all everyone loves. She is like the Hermione Granger of Beautiful Darkness! I also love Lucille. Yes one of my favorite characters is a cat, but this cat is seriously awesome! I don't really know why I love Lucille so much, but she kind of makes the story better for me. I always laugh when Lucille just shows up next to Ethan.    At points it got a little slow, but only for brief moments. Otherwise the writing was better than most.     This book was excellent. I recommend everyone to read this book even if you didn't like the first in the series.
B002QB1910|5.0|I got more than I was expecting from this album. It was brave, raw, no apologies. Great writers, contributors, producers, and it's Rihanna at her best. I don't skip a single song when I put it in my car, but there are songs I always skip to because they make me feel something I can't otherwise explain.<br />Great music, but get ready for something more intense.
B001CC7PPI|2.0|I purchased Rear Window - The Universal Legacy Series for my wife as it is one of her favorite Hitchcock films.  What a dissapointment!  The transfer on thie version is jerky and very grainy.  After watching this for 10 minutes, we went back to the dvd version we recorded directly from cable TV, and that copy isn't the best, but certainly was better.  If I had seen 30 seconds of this copy first, I would have immediatley dismissed it.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|An album that had (say) \\"All Of The Lights\\", \\"Monster\\", \\"So Appalled\\", or \\"Runaway\\" as its best track would be worth listening to. This one has all those and more. It's clever and witty and Stendhal-esque and tragic, and I actually laughed, and actually cried. Maybe you will too.    Also, at $4, it has no competition as the best deal on all of Amazon.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|Fantastic album, not as good as the previous one, Room on Fire, but twice as long and still absolutely ear-candy. Highly recommended. Notable songs include Razorblade, Ask Me Anything, and Fear of Sleep :)
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I've been a fan of Ken Follett for years and have been looking forward to this new release.  Now I still have to wait.  Sure, it's a big \\"book\\" for $20 but how in the world can that be justified when I'm unable to lend it to friends and family as I could a physical book?  Either the model has to change and the ability to \\"lend\\" a book must be implemented OR the publishers have to come to grips with the fact that selling a \\"single user\\" book cannot support a 20 dollar pricetag.  I'll either borrow it from the library or just wait for the price to return to earth.
0307473708|2.0|Jeff Lindsay definitely likes his alliteration.  It is a device that becomes overused in the book, especially in the sentence that contains six \\"d\\" words in a row.  This is where the editor should have tapped him on the shoulder and got him to exercise some restraint.    It's clear that the writers of the TV show are mainly responsible for the quality of the storytelling, because the source material is woefully undeveloped and shallow.  Aside from the inevitable differences in characters and events, Dexter is somehow \\"guided\\" to the right places at the right time, including the scene of the denouement, by his Dark Passenger, his evil side.  The reader can only assume Lindsay is hinting at a psychic or otherwise supernatural talent here.  The TV show wisely jettisons this and replaces it with good old-fashioned police work.  Anyone expecting a good police procedural here will be disappointed.    The writing starts out with an absolutely terrible couple of pages, full of ramblings about the moon.  It then settles down somewhat, but there's often a goofy sentence or two that take you out of the story.  Dexter seems to have an odd sense of humor, different than in the TV show, and almost British in its eccentricity.  It's affectation, and again, bonus points to the TV crew for toning it down.  One example of questionable writing is when a feeling Dexter has is described as \\"a silk scarf with spiders legs\\"  Huh??    At 340 pages, the book falls short on depth, characterization, and structure.  Dexter spends much of the book trying to decide if he is the Tamiami Killer or not.  He decides he isn't, something else happens and - unbelievably - he is questioning himself again.  It would be nice if this mystical or existential claptrap was replaced by hunting the real killer.  More disappointment for fans of the show in that Angel is barely in the book at all, and isn't even given the courtesy of being a rounded-out character.  Rita and the kids are also pushed way into the background, and given just a couple of scenes.  Dexter's family life here is little more than an afterthought.  The TV show has more time to play with in developing the characters, but there's no reason to come in sixty pages short of the usual novel length with this little plot or character development.    Also, sorry to break it to you, but Dexter doesn't really get into any tight scrapes with being found out.  LaGuerta and Doakes have their suspicions, but that's about it.    Although the overall effort is weak, it's not absolutely terrible. All in all, a pretty breezy albeit vapid read, perfect if you have time to kill and don't want anything too involving.
B001GM28HO|5.0|If Gwen Stefani got you thru high school or you reveled in how Madonna (while mild by today's standards) shocked us with her sexuality in the 80's, cut thru the hype and buy this album. Lady Gaga is following her own rules and ambitiously paints a musical picture and standard of performance no one else could pull off and few would be brave enough to try. I wouldn't get this album for a 12-year-old, but once you're 15 you probably know about everything she comments on anyway & while there are a couple tracks I skip when I'm listening for lyrics, this is a great, fun album that will stay a notable piece of music history.<br /><br />The lyrics are good, sometimes brilliant, the music is engaging, and the album has a very clear message: indulgence with no apologies.
B004498KPU|3.0|Watched Michael Jackson's Vision over the Thanksgiving Day holiday and was disappointed. Not in the quality, for each video was fine. I didn't experience the grainy effect that others have, but in the fact that most of the videos (especially disc 1) were encased in this thick black box which in turn causes the video to look very small. Michael was meant to be enjoyed in a large view, whether it was a short film or in concert live. Michael would not have cheated his fans if he was allowed to oversee this project and Sony basically ripped off the fans with this project. Now I am not so sure if I wlll get the album \\"Michael\\". The one song I did hear, which was \\"Breaking News\\" definitely sounded like someone else was singing the song with snippets of Michael in the back. Michael should never be in the back on his own song and if this is the case with one song, what about the other songs. There was a reason why they were unreleased in the first place. This video project with all of his short films in one set was a good idea but was poorly executed. The fans should have been surveyed beforehand on how they wanted the short films to look (clarity vs format). One would think that with today's technology they could have delivered on both fronts. Also \\"Ghosts\\" should have been the full version. Sony has now put everyone on notice to be very selective on future offerings from them concerning Michael.
0316067598|5.0|I enjoyed this book, I got it on Wed, and finished it Saturday night and I am not a big time reader.  The story was well told, and as a person that enjoys military books I have no complaints about this one.  It also makes some of the elements of the new Medal of Honor game seem more real when compared with reality.
0812550706|5.0|I read this, for the first times, as part of an undergraduate literature survey class in fall of 2000. It continues to be one of my top 10 favs of all time and probably my favorite scifi book. I have read it twice more since then and continue to enjoy it every time. OSCard sets the standard for military scifi. The world he has created is mazing in its scope and realism.  It does contain a lot of scifi jargon and may be difficult for a first time scifi reader. More experienced readers will find the availabilty of an entire comepleted series refreshing. OSCard is still adding to the Enderverse but enough published material is available to be able to read for some time.<br /><br />As a teacher this is one of the selections on my annual summer reading list for high school sophomore World Literature.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We've had Blokus for at least 5 years and we still love it. It is a game of strategy for two to four players.<br /><br />The object of the game is to place as many (or all) of your plastic tiles on the Blokus board. The only rule is that you can only place your next tile corner to corner with one of your other pieces. So as more pieces get placed, there is less room to put your pieces (and less space for your opponents as well).<br /><br />Each tile has a point value so at the end of the game, the bigger and the mroe tiles you have left, the higher your score. The person with the lowest score (and therefore the most tiles placed) wins.<br /><br />My daughter started playing when she was four and has developed a better strategy watching others play and has grown a little older (she is now 6). My 11-year old is a tough player and understands the intricacies of placing his tiles while blocking my moves.<br /><br />It takes great spacial thinking and strategy.<br /><br />There are a lot of little pieces. When we are done playing we use a Ziploc baggies to put the tiles in by color so that the next time we want to play, they are all ready to go and we aren't missing any of them.<br /><br />If you want to play with only two players, each player can use two color sets. If you want to play with three players, each player takes turns placing a tile from the unused color set. That way, the board still fills in.<br /><br />This is a great price. When I originally bought it (and many additional sets as presents) it was never offered at a discount.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love this show! My one qualm with the DVD is that there could be more extras included (mostly because the ones that are included are fun) but otherwise great.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|This album continues the same discourse as THE FAME. Tracks are just as good, arguably better & more consistent, than the first album. The tracks they released as singles are the hottest & most commercial of this bonus track release, but if you liked THE FAME don't hesitate to pick this up, too.
B000063DI9|5.0|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988) is a powerful hard-rocking album that manages to have a friendly melody to some of the songs, such as CAN I PLAY WITH MADNESS (very addictive chorus), THE CLAIRVOYANT, MOONCHILD, and to an extent, THE EVIL THAT MEN DO. What is different with this album as opposed to Powerslave is the lesser amount of heaviness to the sound. This album and Somewhere in Time aren't as heavy as Powerslave, which is fine, but I prefer the Powerslave sound. This album is awesome (5 stars), but I thought I'd compare two different sounding albums to show the direction taken from one of the greatest heavy metal bands of all time. This album is very unique, in that it fuses melody with heavy metal, and probably attracted a wider audience. Oh, and did I mention MTV's influence? Some of the band members cite this album as their best work. I can live with that, but prefer Powerslave. Still, this album gets my praise. 9.5/10
044654759X|5.0|This book is so great, I couldn't put it down!  Once you get to the end chapters there is no way you can stop reading until it is finished!  I loved how it pulled me in and didn't let go until the end!  This book is a Christmas gift for my Mom and I can't wait for her to read it so we can talk about it!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I agree this \\"Star Trek\\" is very entertaining eye candy that relies to much on CGI effects.   However, it was fun and entertaining.      I agree with Matthew T. Weflen \\"Matthew Weflen\\" (Chicago, IL) and all his technology praise.  (I'm a Trekkie and not a Teckkie and could never have done the great job he did describing its great technological advances.)  They are right on.    I agree with L P \\"lilip\\" (Los Angeles)'s \\" . . .  Star Trek: The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, and Voyager are all rendered invalid, because a couple of writers . . .\\"      This movie has no relation with the Star Trek universe at all but to rip off the name for ticket and DVD sells.    But I do have and easy fix for future sequels to this movie to bring it in line.    First, J.J. Abrams' needs to sit down and watch all 600+ episodes of the 4 series and all the previous movies to wake-up to the critical importance of Vulcan and that you can't wipe it out of existence and still have a Star Trek storyline.      Second, fire his two writers and never use them again.      How do you undo the damage Mr. Abrams has done?  Easy, Hollywood's done it before!  Do a \\"DALLAS\\".  In the opening scene of the next movie have Kirk come to on the floor of the bar and say, \\"WOW, what I dream I just had.\\"  And try again.      This movie is like two earlier ones Hollywood put out I can mention as examples:  James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" and Michael Bay's \\"Pearl Harbor\\".  These two movies had nothing to do with either the Titanic or Pearl Harbor.  They were just backdrops to love stories.      As, I have told other's, \\"You want to see a great movie about the Titanic, watch \\"A Night to Remember\\", want to see a great movie about Pearl Harbor, watch \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\".\\"  But those two by Cameron and Bay are just great love story movies with famous backdrops, and with little accuracy to those backdrops.      The same holds true with this movie.  If you're a \\"Trekkie\\" like me, enjoy the film for the eye candy it is.  Just remember, it is just a good bang-bang shoot'em up using the Star Trek universe as a backdrop.  Watch the earlier Star Trek movies and series for true Star Trek.      Want Hollywood to correct itself.  Boycott any future ones by Abrams.  Hitting Hollywood in the pocketbook ALWAYS gets their attention!      So, enjoy the movie, it has great special effects, great new actors, and great picture quality.    But Star Trek, it isn't.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I guess we are all entitled to having an opinion. However, if you can't hear the greatness in Sigh No More, we must have little or nothing in common! This is one of the most creative, melodic, energetic and inspiring records I have heard in years. I was happy to hear the group dropped their opposition to doing a radio edit on Little Lion Man, that enabled this exciting new band to gain the much deserved (and needed) exposure in cities across America. During a time when there isn't much on the radio that requires an increase in volume, Mumford & Sons fills that void and provides much needed relief. This CD is deep! There are several, if not many songs that show mature song writing and a unique combination of London Pub music, American Folk Rock and pure rock energy. Listen to The Cave, Roll Away Your Stone, White Blank Page, Thistle & Weeds and Winter Winds. That's at least a half a dozen tracks that will get heavy rotation on my iPod for most of 2011. Thumbs up and five stars.

0671759159|4.0|My friends no doubt thought me crazy for reading Peter Lynch's 15-year-old investment book. Anything about the stock market that's printed on dead trees must be outdated, right?<br /><br />Not entirely.<br /><br />Certainly many of the individual stock recommendations are no longer applicable, because companies, industries, and regulations have changed. This book predates Sarbanes-Oxley. (That's what makes this a 4-star review.)<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book is informative on two counts. First, as a sort of professional biography, in which Lynch recounts his experiences as a stockpicker. And second, as a manual describing how to research public companies.<br /><br />One can always learn from history, and Lynch's observations about \\"The Great Correction of '87\\" are instructive for those wondering how to invest in the current climate. Chapter nine is called \\"Prospecting in Bad News.\\"<br /><br />People and companies can learn from mistakes. But it's equally important to learn from other people's successes. The Great Correction of '87 did not herald the end of civilization, nor did the Great Recession. The lessons on how Lynch and others prospected their way to success through the recessions of the '80s and '90s are still instructive to us today, even though we are no longer able to follow his suggestion to buy Chrysler. Even if we wanted to.
0143118420|5.0|Pure amazing!  I got sucked in to it on the 1st chapter.  Goes in to a lot of detail so if you get bored with that kind of thing this may not be a good book to you.  I thought it was beautifuly written.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I've only read a little of the book but i'm lovin' it.  It's so mysterious and tragic so far.  I'm ten years old and this is the best book of my life.  Riordian does a great job on all his books.  People say I should read the Harry Potter series, but I HATE it.  Nice job Rick!
B002RWKSII|2.0|the enigmatic chord changes of brian wilson, and gershwin? but who knows about some ham-handed redo vocal of old tunes that you wish sinatra were singing; oddly, first and last bits are pure beach boys of a classic, way too briefly, the rest is pap, and i was hoping for some bit of surf's up
1603580557|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone new to systems thinking written by the person who has probably contributed the most influential thoughts. I enjoyed it and finding myself returning to it frequently as I continue to utilize/process these concepts in my daily thought life.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I'm one of those who hasn't yet read this book. So far, I've been able to see the movie and then read the book and that works for me - I don't want any visions of anything in my own head to ruin the movie for me. Reading through some of these reviews, maybe I should have read this book first.<br /><br />But having said that, I really love this movie. The first time I saw it, to be honest, I was quite bored with all the camping scenes and could have done with some more of the wedding, instead. I didn't realize that Bill was marrying Fleur from the tri-wizard cup until the second time I saw it. And there's a tiny bit of conversation that gives the impression that Bill's now a werewolf himself and learning things from Lupin, who's going to become a father soon, at least that's what seems to be implied. Would have loved more info here!<br /><br />Also, I had forgotten some things that happened in the 'Half Blood Prince' and watched it closely before seeing the 'Deathly Hallows' the second time. Three of the characters looked the same to me, so that was confusing and I'm not sure why Mr Malfoy was acting so scared and timid around Voldemort when he'd always been so bold around him before. And I'm still holding out for Snape to turn out to be one of the good guys! And did we *really* lose Mad Eye? We didn't see him killed, maybe he's recuperating somewhere while we're all watching Harry and Hermione camping? No idea.<br /><br />The humor in this film is excellent, I didn't really think there would be much to laugh at in this installment. The scene with all the Harry's was hysterical, then George with the toothbrush stuck in his ear, that guy just has to stand there wearing that goofy expression and it's hilarious. Then comes the polyjuice potion. The guy playing Harry was absolutely perfect with his expressions and body movement, it cracked me up just seeing him turn and walk away.<br /><br />And the ultimate sign of a great movie is when the entire audience says 'ahhhhhhhhhh!!!' when it's over, everyone wants to see more!e wants to see more!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I really liked the part when they fought the dragon towards the end of the book, but I also think that the author should of written more books because they were really good.
B000WTDUQK|5.0|I recently had to read a portion of this boook for one of my grad school classes; I enjoyed that first chapter so much that I decided that I HAD to read the whole thing, and I will someday.  It was a great price and the book is in great condition.
B003X2O6KW|1.0|Although I didn't like Kanye's previous two records, I liked Late Registration and - based on the glowing reviews for this one - decided to get it on the day it came out.   My big issue with Kanye and his music is that he's using his talent to inspire future artists to see that the path to success is to use the n-word like it's a conjunction, drop F and Mother F-bombs throughout every song, and, of course, refer to women as bitches or 'hos (unless it's your mother).   Apparently, Kanye's intimidated enough critics around the country that they not only gloss over his juvenile lyrics, but give him high marks for this garbage of a record (5 stars from Rolling Stone; 10.0 from Pitchfork???).  While I'm not too well versed in hip-hop, last time I checked it's still considered music.  I am certain that any non-hip hop artist singing about bitches, 'hos, being rich, getting head, dropping F and MF-bombs, and using an offensive slur in every song, would be universally canned by critics and rightfully ridiculed by the press.   I keep hoping that the bar for hip-hop artists gets raised above these trashy lyrics and critics start holding artists like Kanye West to the same standards as everyone else in the music industry.    I despise hearing people say the 'n-word' and cannot understand why it's used so freely and publicly by some of the same people who would turn on any white person for saying the word even once.   It's beyond hypocritical and the tired rationalizations (\\"we can say it to each other\\", \\"it ends with an 'a'\\") have become lame excuses.    While I hate George Bush for a lot of reasons, it's hard to reconcile how the person who publicly called him a racist on live tv (\\"George Bush hates black people\\") can release record after record filled with nothing but racial slurs and sexist comments.    Bottom line:  This is  another Kanye West cd; it will sell millions; he'll make millions; and we can all look forward to a whole new generation of rappers being just like Kanye.   Sorry for sounding preachy.   I was hoping that the critics were rewarding him for his growth and maturity as an artist, but could not have been more mistaken.
0743277465|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from this book at all. I was surprised that there are actual techniques included that can be utilized. I am impressed with the author's breadth of understanding here and will implement these techniques myself.
B003XX2PD6|5.0|Deerhunter has went all the way with this album. This is by far their best recording in an impressive history of musical output. Every song on this album standouts. The music soars and rocks with an ethereal feel that can only be matched by such greats as Radiohead and Pink Floyd. with this album Deerhunter has reached the ranks of the greats.     My belief is they will at least earn a few Grammy award nominations for this album. It should be a contender for Album of the Year.
B0044KU7KU|4.0|The problem here is that their last album The Black Parade was so good. That being said this album isn't bad, but it's not great like their last effort. Most of the songs here are enjoyable to listen to. From start to finish it's a good album.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|When the first edition of Avatar was released, people gave bad reviews complaining that it wasn't in 3D and that it didn't have features. Now they release it again with it packed with all the features that you all wanted, yet you still complain. The first release was lousy, I admit. But didn't we all know that they were going to release a better editon in the future? If you really wanted all of the features without buying the first one, then you should have waited until this edition came out, no matter how long it took. If you are complaining about how you bought the first edition and feel \\"ripped off\\" because they are releasing a better edition, here is a little advice. Don't buy it, it's that simple! They never said that they intended for everyone to buy the first edition, and then get more money by releasing another and making you buy that one. They are not \\"making\\" you buy it, it's all your own choice. Stop flooding this page with bad reviews complaining about something you don't even have. This is for people who HAVE the product or have a review of the movie itself. Because of these dumb reviews the overall rating gets pulled down to where it shouldn't be. There is no business giving a review of something you don't even have.
067144901X|1.0|I was so blown away by the effusive reviews on these books that I bought both full sets for my 17 month old grandson and one set each for my other four grandchildren, ages 18 months, 2 and 3 years, to give as Christmas presents -- all these children have many books and are read to on a regular basis.  I was very disappointed -- I wish I had my money back!! The 17 month old bats the book away with his hand when I pick it up to read to him -- he will only listen to a bit of the \\"Doggie\\" book because I make all those tiresome dog \\"barking\\" sounds. The pictures are so simplistic -- a few sketchy lines -- that only the 3 year old can make sense of them. I have noticed that all the children are drawn to pictures of real photo-looking pictures of children and animals. and they all love Margaret Wise Brown because the words and pictures are something that they already know about and recognize. If you want books that children will love to read over and over, look elsewhere.
B004ASVS0E|5.0|On my first listen, I thought it was a pleasant addition to the catalog of Christmas from pop musicians but then I left it on repeat in my car CD player and realized it is much more than that. The songs on this album are pretty standard fare but it is the arrangements that really make them stand out. The Arabic-tinged God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen alone is worth the price of admission but it was really the reinterpretation of the Coventry Carol as a war chant that blew me away. Even a Victorian warhorse dirge like See Amid the Winter's Snow gets new life and exuberance. Every song benefits from Ms. Lennox's vocal style of enunciating each word clearly and precisely. The poetry of the original lyrics really shine through.<br />The only track that I could live without is the only original song, Universal Child. I really don't get that one.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|Over the past 9 years Norah Jones has become a permanent fixture on the landscape of popular music. all her albums have been solid with outstanding musical textures and fantastic vocals. This collection shows Norah's versatility and ability to blend with a variety of different types of musical artists.    On these duets Norah goes from hip hop to country to jazz, pop and more.     My favorite tracks are \\"Blue Bayou\\" with M. Ward - I love this ethereal rendition of this great Roy Orbison tune. \\"Creepin' In\\" with Dolly Parton has long been a favorite and \\"The Best Part\\" recorded by El Madmo (Norah's band) is just fantastic.    This is a must buy for any Norah Jones fan and is a great for anybody looking for something with variety and texture.

0671027344|5.0|I have read alot of books...I guess you could say I am a book worm ,and five years after first reading this book to this day I can still claim it is still THE BEST book I have EVER read. If you have ever delt with drugs,or felt misplaced, I feel like you can relate to charlie's story. I read this book within one day. My boyfriend bought me a copy when I was 16 and to this day I have no idea where it is because it has been passed so many times from a friend, to a friend ,to a friend...it's that good.So my suggestion to you would be to Read it because, it's amazing!
031603973X|5.0|If you look up this book on a book seller site, it will say Pop-Up book.  But calling what Chuck Fischer does with paper pop-up is like saying the ocean is a bit wet.  He calls it paper engineering and that is a much more accurate term.<br /><br />Fischer has retold Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol with magically intricate paper art.  Each page unfolds to amazing figures that leap off the page.  The images are amazingly detailed and take the reader to Victorian England.  Each page also has an insert booklet where the reader can read related chapters from Dicken's novel.<br /><br />Fischer has done images for the title page (a Victorian London street scene), You Will Be Haunted by Three Spirits (a ghost trailing chains and weights, The Ghost Of Christmas Past (a spirit rising from a candle), The Ghost of Christmas Present (a harvest king with a magnificent feast is portrayed), The Last Of The Spirits (a towering black figure which fills the viewer with awe), and God Bless Us Every One (showing Scrooge and Tiny Tim in a glorious conclusion)<br /><br />Chuck Fischer is an artist whose designs have been replicated world-wide in paintings, holiday ornaments and home furnishings.  His designs include wallpaper and fabrics in the permanent collection of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.  He has done six previous paper engineering books.  I was lucky enough to get a copy of his glorious Angels last year.  These books are destined to become family heirlooms for the joy they bring to the viewer and are highly recommended for all readers, whether young or young at heart.
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|Ok so here is my review on the Blu ray box set. I really enjoyed all of the movies. The picture quality on all the movies are superb, as well as the audio. I do like the extras that are included, I also enjoyed watching the bonus disc Captain's summit. The only thing that is keeping this box set from a perfect score. Is that they could have spent a lil extra time to do a set up like they did with the blu ray version of Star Trek (TOS) and had the option to play the theatrical and the extended versions instead of just giving us the theatrical versions. I can't help but think that they are gonna re-release that way some time down the line anyway if the paramount's history with Star Trek is any indicator... I was gonna hold out on buying this box set because of my theory, but I fortunately stumbbled acrossed the Blu ray version of this box set for $30.00 so at that price I acted like a frog and jumped on it. I hope this review helps.

B0043KK4N6|5.0|I can't begin to express my admiration for the movie after seeing it with my friends today, who also adored it. No adequate words come to mind. And these songs mean even more than they did on Monday when I first purchased this album, after seeing it!<br /><br />I perceived a strong vibe that the underlying metaphor in the movie is indeed a reflection of the current state of music, where performance, theatrics and the smoke and mirrors of a good show are more significant to people than true talent, which Christina most definitely has. How many times has Christina been unjustly compared or overlooked despite those powerhouse pipes simply because someone else can dance better while lipsynching or because they wear absurd and insensible clothing, or because they're prettier? I respected the film so much for making it a point to address that the truth is struggling desperately to survive in this industry.<br /><br />It was just as Vince stated in the beginning; it is all about people who come to see them do a routine lipsynching to the greats, that the legends are of a bygone era, and although their spirit is very much alive in artists like Christina, if we don't appreciate and cherish the fragile essence of their presence among us, they will disappear with the shifting tide, and fade away all too soon with time. We need to preserve people like Christina, not pit them against other females that are NOT in their class, or to report scandals about them and harsh untruths, or cast a deaf ear to their music because it is meant for a creative mind and good taste rather than a club. The true divas are fading away. But their presence will always be known, like that one pure white shell against a beach of sandy brown grains.<br /><br />And the world will know they lived and breathed that legacy. My unconditional respect for Christina Aguilera, who demonstrates to me with each song and each role that she is indeed legendary, and deserves to carry the respect and fortune her talent warrants, before she is nothing more than a fond memory of the last true musician. The last elegant human voice, lost in a chorus of auto-tune.<br /><br />CHRISTINA AND CHER!s nothing more than a fond memory of the last true musician. The last elegant human voice, lost in a chorus of auto-tune.    CHRISTINA AND CHER!
0316017922|5.0|In Outliers, The Story Of Success, Malcolm Gladwell shows research that puts forward the theory that success is a combination of factors.  While intelligence plays a large part, so do birth order, cultural assumptions, and above all hard work.  Individuals must have the ability to see opportunities and then have the skills to take advantage of them.<br /><br />One of the earliest chapters focuses on professional hockey players.  They are overwhelmingly born in the first three months of the year.  Inexplicable coincidence?  No, more likely that this phenomenon is the result of age cutoffs in sports teams, so that those born in January, February and March are usually the oldest on their teams, so more developed and more likely to be noticed.  Those noticed are picked for more advanced teams where they get more training, better coaching and more practice and playing time, all of which give them the opportunity to become better players than those who are left on their first skill level teams.<br /><br />This plays out over and over again when trends are seen.  The dot-com millionaires?  Almost all were born from 1952-1955, when the computer was first introduced to the public, and kids in schools could get hours upon hours of programming time.  Successful musicians?  Most practice hundreds more hours than those who just never quite make it to the top.  Both groups are talented, but one group takes advantage of opportunities and hard work to develop that talent.<br /><br />In one study, bright children in California were tested and tracked for over forty years.  Although all started in the brightest groups, by adulthood they had fallen into the superstars, the average and those who didn't quite make it.  Luck of the draw?  That assumption can be challenged when the facts show that those in the bottom group almost overwhelmingly had parents who were uninvolved in their lives and who didn't help their children focus and refine their talents.  Parenting styles seem to make a big difference.<br /><br />Gladwell has written a thought-provoking book.  His thesis can be summed up in this quote: \\"...success follows a predictable course.  It is not the brightest who succeed.  Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf.  It is, rather, a gift.  Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have the strength and presence of mind to seize them. ...To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success--the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history--with a society that provides opportunities for all.\\"  This book is recommended for readers that are interested in learning how the world works and how we might improve it.well has written a thought-provoking book.

0743435729|2.0|Honor Harrington, now a hero from [[ASIN:0743435710 On Basilisk Station (Honor Harrington)]] is sent with a brand new ship into a tricky political situation.  The world she is assigned to, Grayson, is a literalistic biblical colony world on a poisonous planet, where women are virtual slaves.  Grayson is essentially at war with another system of biblical fanatics, Masada, who treat women like real chattel slaves and also beat them.  Weber spends a lot of page count going over how this political situation developed historically, including a scene with a Grayson admiral where his wives (who cannot vote or own property) are shown as *gasp* intelligent people!    Yeah, this gets a little much even for Hardcore Honor Harrignton, and she takes a convoy out for about ten days.  Guess who needs to bail Grayson out when Masada launches a surprise invasion?  Yep, that's the book.  It's also available at the Baen Free library online, so if you liked the first one, give it a shot.  Personally the misogyny got in the way of my enjoyment of the book, because it felt like Weber was saying 'Here are some worlds that hate girls, Honor will show them girls can be hardcore [military] too!'  This sentiment was spread on way, way, too thick.
B00007GZR5|3.0|I read the book \\"after\\" watching this movie.  As with most books that has a movie counterpart, this is the same -- where the book was much better.  There were several alterations that were not in the book, which I will not state since it would be a spoiler for those that have not watched this.    All in all, the concept that is conveyed still corroborates with all the other sources I have found concerning death, life after death, and reincarnation, and that \\"hell\\" is a personal one that can only be set free by those who recognize this and make the choice to cross over to the light (the other side).    -----    Journey of Souls - Dr. Michael Newton
B00112ASYO|4.0|This toy is very simple: it's a relatively realistic, but small, crocodile. If your child likes playing with animals and likes crocodiles, this will fit the bill. I wouldn't recommend it for very small children, as the Schleish series of toys can have some sharp edges, but barring that, it's worth it. It's extremely durable and is likely to take any abuse your child can dish out.
0143118420|5.0|Life tends to hand you exactly what you need (almost) exactly when you need it. Or so I've found. And this book... This book arrived in my life at precisely the right moment - exactly when I needed it. Loved everything about it. I've heard some people say that the author is a bit too whiney and self-indulgent, but I just thought she was real, down-to-earth, and honest. In fact, I could relate to her on practically every level. And if that makes ME a bit too whiney and self-indulgent, then so be it. :)
B003OWVHVC|2.0|I bought this cd after reading that Aloe's for folks who like Mayer Hawthorne & Eli \\"Paperboy\\" Reed.  Unfortunately, he's not even close. He might be on the Stones Throw label, but there the similarity ends. MH & Eli bring a new dimension to the classic music they so seriously channel.  Aloe's got all the right stuff in place, horns n' all,  but the songs, just aren't all that special.

0545128285|5.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan and when they came out with this I automatically wanted it because it's inspired by Harry Potter and I thought it would be kinda cool to see what stories wizards told their children. My favorite is the Tale of Three Brothers. My brother bought this for me for Christmas and I absolutely loved it. lol. I would definately reccomend this book to any die hard harry potter fan!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Brillantly written, the storyline follows two brothers on their ultimate quest to save the world from evil. Demons, vampires, ghosts, goblins - this show has it all. Even angels. (Thank you, Season Four!) This series has something for everyone.  The writers are clever. The actors engaging. Supernatural has everything - humor, drama, thrills, chills, horror, hope... I could go on. And on. And on. And...  Well, you get the idea.   :)

B004BRP7R4|5.0|If I made any changes to this CD, it would be to strip it down even further.  Groban's voice stands alone without fancy orchestration. But if you love that, this CD has it also, especially the rich, soaring L'Ora Dell'Addio.    Favorites:   Bells of New York City - evoking the melancholy draw of the city's soft undertones.   Higher Window - beseeching another chance, that is probably not going to happen.  Love Only Knows - classic star-crossed lovers, wrong place, wrong time.    Wandering Kind - I thought I'd feel cheated that one track did not have vocals.  Not so.    War at Home - soldiers fighting the long, cruel war of recovery at home.    I could go on.  There is not a track that I do not like, including the 3 bonus tracks available at other sites.    The negative reviews seem to be two-fold - either the listener wanted more of Rubin's minimalist stamp, or the listener wanted more of the same ol', same ol'. Diametrically opposite views.  To each his own, but this CD is my absolute favorite of all of Groban's, and i have them all.  It is a departure I fully welcome, and his voice, well, his voice is The Voice.     If you are wavering, buy it.

B002VECM6S|5.0|What does our legacy leave when our life is gone? Am incredible movie of faith, hope and love. For so many people who call American a Christian nation, I have to ask myself sometime where is the faith, hope and love. Because of the Whitewash (Yes, I am Caucasian) history textbook we were taught so little of the cruelty, rape, murder committed against the Black man. I was not taught about vagrancy laws where a black man could be arrested if he did not have money.  Then he was fined and sold to a plantation owner.  This happen in the 1900's.  There has been so much more that has given many Americans the feeling that other races are expendable. There needs to be healing in America.          Back to the movie. Yes it is extremely inspirational. It has challenge me to think and help those less fortunate. It is a must see and you have an excellent  opportunity to get the movie at a great price with Amazon. Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, Kathy Bates and Quinton Aaron do such a great job acting, there were times I knew my body was in my theater seat, but I felt my heart and emotions were in the actual scenes. The family portrayed in this movie had money, but they knew that these three remain, faith hope and love, and the greatest of these is love.      Louis Goins
184831163X|5.0|The first thing to say about this excellent book is that it is very readable.  I consumed it quickly over a weekend and mostly on public transport.  Fine is an intelligent and generous writer able to juggle concepts from different disciplines without loosing the central thread, or the audience.  This book is also fueled by a (dark) sense of humour and a clear eyed idealism.<br /><br />Are little boys and little girls essentialy different or are the differences between them the result of a world that treats them differently from birth (or even earlier)?  Fine is posing the latter argument.<br /><br />Her attack is two pronged, she is at once challenging the scientific community whose research into the origins of gender difference might be a little bit incautious and one-eyed, in the thrall of new technology and their own historical context, and at the same time she is going after the pop-science, mass media, and self- and parenting-help writers who have turned that science into an industry designed to justify a sexist status quo.<br /><br />This book provides the reader with a lot of joy, when is it not fun to see someone deflate the sort of pompous ass who can co-author a paper with his wife explaining that men are incapable of preparing dinner, but it also going to make readers angry that this sort of 'men are from mars' tripe is gaining credence in schools, universities, and the business world.
0312600844|3.0|This rich and engaging story is almost a great novel. It's well written and many of the characters are complex - even if they appear rather cartoonish early in the novel. The complexity is revealed as the story follows them over the course of 30 years. The problem is the characterization of the women, and for a book with several major female characters that's a big problem. When you are reading Patty Berglund's autobiography, or descriptions of how she is thinking and feeling, you can't forget that the words were written by a man. And a rather clueless one at that.    This book would have been better if it had been less ambitious and the author had left out what he doesn't understand.

B003ES5JDS|4.0|...but that doesn't prevent me from enjoying this knock-it-outta-da-park addition to the \\"DC Universe\\" animated features! The only thing I truly hated about this disc set is Warner Brothers' infuriating \\"half-assed\\" keepcases! (just when we thought they'd learned their lesson with those gawd-awful flimsy-azzed \\"snapcases\\" -- WB's dvd distribution arm needs to be B*slapped 4Real!)<br /><br />Any way, moving on from my rant about WB's shoddy-azzed \\"product packaging\\" -- as I've said, I've NEVER liked \\"Robin\\": I'd always felt Batman didn't need him & that a \\"kid sidekick\\" was too much of a hinderance to him... but I'd especially hated that gawdy-azz costume! But \\"Under the [Red] Hood\\" almost does the character justice!<br /><br />Having long since moved away from being a comics collector, I was unfamiliar with the original story this feature is based on (with the exception of the death of Jason Todd, which I was still around for), but this entry is powerful enough all the same!<br /><br />Despite how much I'd really like to move \\"Superman & Batman: Apocalypse\\" ahead to the #2 spot, in light of the action & moving drama of \\"Red Hood,\\" I just can't bring myself to justifiably do it.<br /><br />Though the wrap-up for this one could've (and should've) been a lot better... and \\"Amazo\\"???? (WTH? -- a whole who's who of baddies DC could've pulled up for the occasion, and they gave us \\"Amazo\\"?) -- even so, I'm still placing this DCU feature right near the front of the line, just below the dynamite 5-star performance \\"Wonder Woman\\" feature. I'm very happy to have this as an addition to my personal DVD library!
0805091742|5.0|This is a very powerful book for a fellow surgical specialist who teaches professionals on the complexity of surgical practices.  Some complexities can be broken down into simple steps that usually involve common sense practices-like washing of hands-a mundane process but one that is so critical in preventing disease transmission.  His stories about checklists in the aviation industry are particularly relevant to someone who sees how easily the human memory falls and insidiously we are distracted when faced with a complex set of tasks during teaching surgical procedures.  The safe surgery checklist from the reference in the book from the WHO has been adapted for my office following this book.  I could not agree more with the authors comment on-\\"you want people to make sure to get the stupid stuff right\\".  This is a must read for a health care administrators, surgical companies, surgical teams, or instructors of complex surgical procedures.

It's also informative for those who have not been exposed to the challenges of a person with Autism.

B0029XFN9O|4.0|Home Alone 2 is a fitting sequel to the timeless 1990 classic, and this transfer on Blu-ray is great! Most scenes are dazzlingly brilliant, and the bit of grain that shows up from time to time can be virtually eliminated by turning your tv's sharpness setting down to zero. The audio options are many, and the film sounds awesome. I bought this in a 2-pack with Part 1 (which also looks & sounds amazing start to finish). I highly recommend this blu-ray!

This soundtrack was flawless on account of the impeccable and angelic super human vocals as well as the correct and perfectly fitting adaptation to the film itself. It is 'Bound' to win many soundtrack awards.     P.S Cher's 2 takes were kickass as well. It's the best [...] bucks u could ever spend!     And if u haven't already. Just go see the damn Movie.

1608201236|2.0|I decided to buy this book and The Hell You Say (Which I want to return) because I want to read more about Adrien and Jake love story and also I love mystery. I ditch the book half-way through because I lost my interest to read it. I'm as good as Adrien sleeping in the car in every roads they take.<br /><br />Mystery- love it,- but the investigation/sleuths are lack of even a tiny minnie sparkle of adventure or thriller. There are adventures but as I said the adventure of sleeping Adrien, ask a few questions and getting shot- that all!. Don't count on their romance or intimate moment at least half way through the book (that where I ditch the book).<br /><br />I give 2 stars for this book because I think it was well writen- but like a life-journal of my boring life.
B003VB5E2E|3.0|I've got all three of these Crossroads festivals and 2010 is not the best of the bunch. Of course Eric is still top shelf, His performance with Steve Winwood on Voodoo Chile was terrific. The other stand outs where Susan Tedeschi's great voice and band. Jeff Beck's version of Nesen Dorma. Beck always is improving and is always doing something new. I know Derek Trucks is capable of far more than just sliding a piece of glass over the strings. There is way to much emphasis on Slide Guitar. I know it's a blues thing, but not every song. Enough already. David Hildago and his boys still light it up. The other great performance was Earl Klugh. Eric needs to allow more jazz players into the fold. Personally I think alot of these roots players are afraid of the musicanship of the jazz players. I missed McLaughlin. Mabey next year Eric, Larry Coryell or Mimi Fox huh? If it's a guitiar festival then lets see some other styles. Frankly there were alot of repeat type performances here. I love BB King with all my heart and he's getting on, but we've all heard The Thrill is gone. We've had enough of Killing Floor as well. To be honest, there are bunch of so called big stars featured here, which I'm amazed have a career at all. All in all it looked like a great event. We must keep the Blues alive and live music alive at any cost. Generally I got the feeling that they just showcased the usual performers because they felt that's what folks wanted. There was not the feeling or performances chosen that equalled that last two concerts. The last two I had I watched and still watched repeatedly but this one just doesn't give that feeling. Better luck next time. I hope the next festival, they might want to find some more innovative and newer talent. I also hope that the veteran players stop falling back on what they did and start thinking of new ideas. They should take note of Mr. Beck and Mr. Klugh. Mike Zinna Huntersville, NC.

Not only was I inspired, but educated on some of the processes the sufferer goes through. Ms. Genova's professional experience and research made this book credible.

B00006EXL5|5.0|This band would have not achieved success if it wasn't for its original promotion crew. I was lucky enough to be part of that team. What do you expect for a first album? This album was raw, edgy, and experimental. It was their first album. MAJORITY of bands don't have mommy and daddy to pay for all the best equipment on the market for them. How many fans out there are willing to give their favorite band money or gear? I doubt many of you have. I have for this band and The Matches. To help get them on their feet when they were on the ground was very challenging. Thanks to people like me, we got this band out there. Once My Chemical Romance had their break through album, I was paid back, but for respect I did accept it.     I've met so many fans over the years who thought Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge was their first album. Well, it was their first  mainstream album. That was a good album. The Black Parade blew it away. All good stuff. A lot of times...for me and I know there's a lot of other fans out there that may feel the same...but the first album is simply the best. It's like watching a movie with a sequel or in a trilogy. A lot of times the first movie is the best, despite the others being good.    Right now, I don't like My Chemical Romance's current album. It's not catchy. Perhaps, it will grow on me who knows, but none of their albums will ever compare to the success of their first album. Their first album gained them respect, which is more POWERFUL than their mainstream achievements. I was happy to be part of it. Peace.
0399156577|2.0|I will start out by saying that if you are new to Nora's books, then you will enjoy this book if you like dogs and descriptions about dog training.      My problem with her book is that it is very typical.  You take a basic outline of a woman who was victimized or hurt or whatever, throw in a serial killer, throw in the all-too-typical and boring love scenes, some banter between the main characters that starts out with dislike and moving to ambivalence then to lust and \\"love?\\", add some pseudo suspense and voila, you have another book by NR. Nothing exciting and nothing new or interesting.      With this book, I quit reading her stories because I know that I won't find anything new or interesting, just the standard fare. The fact that Simon was totally a cave-man, knuckle-dragging kind of guy who didn't know how to express kindness or empathy and wound up looking like the kind of guy any sane woman would run from in a heartbeat totally turned me off to this book.  If this is \\"love?\\" then give it a whirl.
B003ODL004|5.0|Whenever I listen to this soundtrack I feel like I am watching to movie again and again! I can remember each point of the movie with which song was playing and I cant wait to buy the movie when it comes out. I would definitely recommend this soundtrack to whoever has seen Inception, otherwise you might not get the deepness of the instrumental music.
B003ODL004|5.0|When I first saw this movie, there were two things that stood out to me:     [1] The mind bending plot; and  [2] The music    So much so that after viewing the movie I found that the music continued to echo in my mind. The songs create an atmosphere that wants and leads you just to think deeply about different things.    I suppose, given the theme of this movie with its concept of dreams within dreams, the composer really had to dig deep to find the right combination of instruments, beats and music that would embellish the visuals that would be portrayed. I think that Mr. Zimmer has delivered the goods, over and beyond his expected measure.    The tracks, while some may be similar in musical theme, each has its own uniqueness. It should be noted that some of the tracks transform themselves around mid-way. So in some cases, a single track is really like 2 different songs.     If faced with a challenge, you  may find that if you give this CD a spin you may just be inspired to create something great.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|There are much better reviews on this product available here. Long and in depth. So I won't repeat their stances. All I can say is I've been an Alien fan since I was kid and I've owned the movies on VHS, DVD, The Anthology on DVD set and now this on Blu-ray. The difference between DVD and Blu-ray has been discussed in depth already and that is the difference that I see. Clearer pictures in some parts, better audio in others. A huge load of extras with his Anthology. I got it on sale so I paid a fraction of the cost. I am more than happy with my purchase and I really don't see how anyone could make a \\"better\\" version. I don't see myself buying the Alien series again until there is some kind of huge break through in technology that could somehow improve the experience in such a way that would warrant an upgrade of some sort.

B003Z2LAAO|1.0|The video talks about the limited ideas only. It talks about how the river is endangered and how fun it is to play with. It lasts for an hour and seems like very long. Not worth the purchase. The 3D effects are kind of okay.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I can't believe anyone would call this series unpatriotic, or anti-Marine. I obviously can't comment on how realistic it is, but I do know that it never showed Marines as anything more or less than human. They did what they had to do to overcome an entrenched, resourceful and determined enemy and they were permanently scarred by what they experienced. I fail, utterly, to see how that would offend anyone who calls themself a patriot. I sure get tired of people who see a political agenda simply because the American military men are not cut from the John Wayne mold. These men were fully human, and the immense pressure of war made have made some of their behavior hard to look at. But that's not a \\"political agenda\\" and only a true ideologue would see it that way.    For fans of \\"Band Of Brothers\\" ( which I am ) it shows a completely different war fought under completely different circumstances. The European and Pacific wars had little in common except their goal of bringing an end to bloodshed started by a tyrants. It falls slightly short in it's off-the-battlefield character development, but only in some minor ways. Other than this it is a great and engrossing series that makes a fine companion piece to \\"Band Of Brothers\\", although \\"The Pacific\\" is definitely the more violent of two. This reflects the radically different strategic and tactical goals of the two wars, not an arbitrary decision to make the series bloodier.    After watching this series and thoroughly enjoying it, I am even more grateful to the U.S. Marines who sacrificed their lives or were left physically and/or mentally disabled. If the effect of \\"The Pacific\\" was to create sentiment of the anti-military variety, it failed miserably in that regard with me. These young men were the best of America, and they fought battles they didn't ask for with courage and tenacity that 99% of us will never need to display. I am proud to be an American and the father of a U.S. Marine. This series has only reinforced these feelings and entertained me immensely along the way.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Hey, I'm One who usually listens to the Heavy Metal type music (Motley Crue,Megadeth,Disturbed ect.) I gotta say I went to this movie and Loved it and as for the soundtrack even better. I'm just surprised nobodys dissing Xtina for for slight borrowing of Marliyn Manson's The Beautiful people. It's certainly obveious there are parts of Marliyn Manson intrumental tracks in Xtina's version of the song. Either way I found both the soundtrack & the movie both excellent.2 horns up all the way. _\m/
031603438X|5.0|I love this book. I just spent my entire holiday break reading it. Once I started, I could not put it down. The man has a lot of memories and he willingly shares them with his fans. But it comes from the heart, not as a \\"tell all\\" experience. An added bonus for musicians, Keith shares a lot of wisdom and soul related to guitar playing. The book reads in a Keith style rhythm which I would expect from the human riff. If you love music, Keith and the Stones this is a great book for you.
B00377V6J2|4.0|This is a wonderful CD/DVD release...it has the original CD...but the DVD is the exciting bonus here to see these two monsters sit and just play incredible blues and just compliment each other...the one thing that I wish is that they would have released the full hour and forty five mins that were played on Canadian TV...I have a video tape of the whole show(transfered to DVD) and there was not a bad tune on it...btw as previously stated in a review that this was their only time that they played together, back in 1987 there was a B.B. King and Friends special on Cinemax(which I had recorded on video and have since transfered to DVD)that has both Stevie Ray and Albert King playing together on numerous tunes including 2 with just them together with BB's band...you could probably find it on Youtube to varify it...this CD/DVD is the best I think we are going to get tho, so do yourself a favor and step back in time and enjoy the master and his apprentice having a great play together...you won't be sorry.
B004AQR29C|1.0|Seriously!?  Come on people!  Isn't there better ways to spend millions of dollars?  I mean what a mindless killing spree!  There is nothing about this movie that stood out or was anything I haven't seen before.  The story line... I'm sorry what story line!?  This is the crap you get when a washed up actor directs, produces, and is the lead of a movie.  You get a high priced piece of CRAP!  I'm so very happy that I only paid […] for this thing and didn't waste my time or money on it in the theater. Sorry for those of you who did waste their time and money!  If you want a mostly action, no boobs, and no acting movie, then this is PERFECT for you!  If you want some loud noises to drown out your roommate and his girl then this movie is PERFECT!  If you like a story, decent acting, and well just a good movie then just SKIP this one.
0385339100|4.0|If you've read any of his books or seen any of the movies, this one contains all the same strands of fast paced mystery and plot.  Lots of fun to read.  You'll love the protagonist, a thief.  The plot revolves around his scheme to get away with stealing millions of dollars, while framing some very unethical lawyers, politicians, and businessman.  I normally don't read the last 20 pages in a book.  I can't stand that denouement where everyone rides off into the sunset and lives happily ever after.  However, I couldn't sleep, so what the hell.  Man, was I glad I did.  Who would have thought he'd put a major plot twist on the second to last page.  I should have seen it coming.<br /><br />Anyways...LOTS OF FUN!
B003NFM3JU|5.0|If you own a 3D tv this is the DVD you have been waiting for to show it off!  I had heard Zemeckis had done a great job using the technology but this is awesome!  Definitely a must  have.
B003HLM2QO|3.0|I have to admit I haven't been a huge fan of anything Ozzy has put out since Ozmosis, which while good was a little heavy on the ballads, but still a good cd nonetheless.  Down to Earth had a decent sound, but other than Facing Hell there weren't any stand out tracks, and the covers album and Black rain only had a few highlights for me as well, both had weak sounds that I guess is a production thing.  Don't know how to describe it but I didn't like the sound of either album.    As for this one, it has a similar sound to Black rain, which for me is a nagative already.  There are only a couple songs I really like, and there are way too many slower songs.  I like a lot of variety in tempos on an album  Still there really isn't a bad song on here.  Even the bonus tracks, which are both faster songs and should have been mixed into the album for SOME depth are decent, so it's at least a consistant listen.  The only track I don't listen to is the little mini track.  There are a few moments that are new for Ozzy, the intro to Time, and the verses to Life won't wait are a little different for Ozzy.  Scream for me is in my opinion the best song Ozzy has put out since Facing hell.  I'm not a fan of most of the lyrics to Digging me down.  Frankly I don't need to hear Ozzy's views on Christianity, and I'm no bilbical scholar, but I don't think Jesus sold brimstone or fire.  I was ok with the lyrics in the bridge which sounded like someone honestly questioning what they'd been told was true, but the rest of it didn't do it for me.  Maybe if he'd followed that path instead I'd have been more of a fan of the lyrical content.  Still it's an alright song, and probably one of the better ones on here.  The rest of the songs are decent, but nothing really special.    Overall it's an alright album.  It's not blizard, nor diary, nor no more tears, but it's still a decent listen.  In addition to the two bonus tracks I also added the song he did this year with Slash to make a more completealbum.  It's not his best, but it does give me hope that he can at least put out a decent album every now and again, and it's way better than anything Robert plant has come out with at his age.  So I'd say if you're an Ozzy fan definately check it out, just don't expect greatness.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This series was \\"loosley\\" based on King Henry VIII. It was made to depict his reign. Which it did very well, in quality entertainment. In that it met with extreme satisfaction. I was very entertained by the actors, script and costumes. In fact, I was so satisfied with this series that my husband bought the box set for me, which I will view time and time again.......not for accurate fact, but, for entertainment.
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|I am thirty one years old and I simply loved it. My husband liked it too and he's my age. I guess you can never be too old to appreciate the land of fairies, stunning graphics and a story that manages to capture your heart. I wish I was apart of the cast. :) They're so lucky that they get to be apart of such a wonderful production!
B0048IMZMG|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums of the year. I can relate to all of her songs. I got it at a discounted price too! I love Amazon for their rewards.
B00095NX9G|5.0|Pretty everything there is to say about this wonderful dvd set has been said already but this dvd set is so great that I can't refrain from reviewing it.  It's a great value for the price.  The instruction is very well done, Rachel does a great job of explaining the moves, reviewing posture and reminding you not to put too much pressure on yourself.  There really is everything, a lot of really great yoga, a fun strengthening warm up, comprehensive technique drills, yoga for back bending and fast and slow choreography.  I love that her isolations are taught over foot patterns instead of stationary and that she encourages you to work up to arm patterns.  Through out the dvd there are opportunities for layering.  This is a dvd that will be very hard to outgrow skills wise, and even if you get to a point as a dancer where the moves are all easy you can use the dvds to keep up your flexibility and technique.      My only very very very small dislike, that didn't even cost the dvd a star, was that I wish there was more flowing of movements.  I loved the way I got to move in the warm up and wished there could have been a bit of cue and dance portion where you got to dance the moves without doing choreography.  That's just a personal like of mine and probably comes from taking a few ATS classes.      All this to say that Rachel Brice has given us all a very great set to learn from and train with.
1926778103|5.0|In my space travels i've collected many-a-art books, and have a vast collection. Of my large collection of probably 60 some-odd art books ranging from Skillful Huntsman to various Disney/Pixar art of books, i'd have to say this one is definitely one of the better ones you'll find. It's super thick, has color work as well as sketches, all the great start to finish stuff thats great to check out, and yeah it's by Joe Mad who by the way is an amazing comic book artist. I highly reccomend this book, i doubt it will disappoint.
0385732554|2.0|There are too many loose ends in this book to make is a satisfying read for an adult. Personally, I found it vapid and wouldn't give it to a child because it lacks the kind of depth one would want to develop in a tween. Although I've read many good reviews of this book, I'm afraid it seems like a re-run of so many other stories
B000V6BE6M|5.0|I got to listen to this series from a library rental for free on the 18 disk each story readings (you can call your library and they will order it in from another library many times) on a vacation and at home/car! Great for kids and was very relaxing and amazingly well done.
B000JML90Y|2.0|I'm sure this is a very good book...<br />Goodness knows I've wanted to read it for a long time<br />and finally here it is -on my Kindle!<br /><br />Must confess I never got through it all -in fact far from it.<br />The writing style is so incredibly long-winded and Flowery Victorian<br />that I had real trouble getting to the essence of what was being said!<br />Obviously, it's my problem, not Darwin's -I realize that<br />and I simply gave up after a chapter or two<br />but if you are a serious student of biology and evolution,<br />and an avid reader who can plough through the best of them<br />then this may be a book for you.<br />I just had Attention Deficit trouble with it, sorry!
B0000069NM|5.0|This album has been a favorite of mine for years. What's not to like about Scofield with Medeski, Martin and Wood (though it's not marketed as a collaboration)? Great ensemble playing, great tunes, great grooves, an edgy approach without being too way out. When my original copy of this CD got ruined, I bought only a couple of the tracks on iTunes. But I missed the rest of the tunes, so I bought the CD again. And will probably do it again someday. It would definitely be a contender for my all-time top 10 favorite list.
B002ZG9774|5.0|This movie was everything I expected it to be and more... there is nothing disappointing about this movie!!  Went to see it at the theater with my 20 year old daughter who danced for 15 years and we both were VERY impressed.  It was thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end and had a great story line.  With an awesome cast... Cher and Christina were great together and the other actors were great as well.  Hollywood definitely chose the right actors for the right parts... I'll be shocked if this movie doesn't receive an Oscar nomination!
B00427X9WI|4.0|I read the book when it came out, and just watched the movie. I enjoyed it. The very first words spoken by the lead character, Julia Roberts, are about a friend of hers who was called upon, as a psychologist, to aid Cambodian refugees in dealing with their feelings about the many trials they have gone through. Surprisingly, it seemed, they mostly wanted to discuss their men/women relationship issues. From there the story proceeds about her quest to sort out her relationship issues, mostly by developing a relationship with herself, something that she never really noticed was underdevoloped, mostly because since 15 yrs. of age she had either been super involved in maintaining a relationship with a man, or ending one so she could start anew with another.    There are films that deal with weighty issues. This is one about a woman who wants to redirect her life, so that she doesn't define it so much by other people and external trappings. She will not become a Saint. I don't think she wants to be one anyway. She won't change the world (but she does give a woman some money toward the building of a house she needs). Because of these things, I found the movie to be one that I think many people can relate to. If she had made incredible changes in many, many lives, she would be a great person, for sure, but not someone that so many can relate with - someone whose identity invariably become lost once in a relationship with someone else.    She visits some exotic locations. I would have enjoyed seeing some more scenic shots. I thought the tempo of the movie was great. Some might think it slow, but it seems European with its pace, and since the film is about her travels - it seemed fitting.    Some of the spoken parts from Julia (Elizabeth) are word for word from the book. The way the author arranged her words is quite amazing, and worth reading or hearing spoken. Elizabeth Gilbert is a very talented author. Her book is a book about a woman on a quest to better herself, she is indulging herself with this, so yes, it is self-indulgent. If one is looking to watch a film about something other than self-indulgence, I would say to just watch something different.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The movie had a lot of action and very fast. The 2 1/2 hours goes by very quick. They end on a cliff-hanger, but still a good end. Can't wait until the next one.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I never was into Kanye, it was only 808s & Heartbreak that got me hooked on him. What attracted me to him on that album was the rawness and level of experimentation he was was doing. I am glad that he is pushing the limits of his music again with this record. I absolutely love it. So much so that I had to get his earlier albums in order to get more Kanye. After hearing everything up to this point he has release I can say that there are elements of everything in here. Get this album you will not be disappointed.
0060594896|5.0|After being in a funk for a while, I was drawn back into reading when shown \\"The Secret\\". Although inspirational, that book left me hungering for more. I started looking into the works of the contributors to that book and am very happy to have landed on this one. Finally, a self-help book that is practical. \\"The Success Principles: ...\\" is very enjoyable, very useful and very down to earth - removes the fluff. A big thanks to the authors. This book is a gift I've shared with family and friends.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|With each new album she puts out, it takes a bit of getting used to for me. I get so involved with the last one that the new one seems to (for a listen or two) be the party crasher that nobody knows. But soon you find yourself liking this new person very much. This album was no different. I find myself listening to it on repeat on my MP3 player all day sometimes. From beginning to end this one just takes you to wonderful places and opens up musical vistas reminiscent of ancient times and cultures long past.
B001FB5634|5.0|I read reviews about the movie in 2008. It was much anticipated, and, not surprising, since the book was so well-received and it garnered a Pulitzer.<br /><br />I loved the acting all around. Viggo Mortenson and Kodi Smit-McPhee were outstanding. Viggo's vulnerability shone through. How to live in a dying world, but yet keep life going through his son?  He never gives up and nor does he relent. He's like Jacob tussling with the angel.<br /><br />Kodi is the  paradigm of the innocence and confusion of childhood that may or may not lead to pathways of harm.<br /><br />Robert Duvall, as the Old Man, brought the weariness and the sheer weight of living in a world so very changed. Death is seen as a luxury, and living is the real hell that one has to bear for the devastation to the earth. His grief for the loss of his son is tinged with guilt. One wonders if he ate his son.<br /><br />The falling of the trees at once expressed the weariness of life and the anger at such great loss.<br /><br />One also wonders about the loss of thumbs. I say it is a symbol of humans never civilization of any kind: hard to build, to grasp without thumbs.<br /><br />I think what is so captivating is that we know that we humans would behave in all the ways portrayed. Each of us, from this vantage point, want to believe that we would be like Kodi's character and not like the cannibals. But faced with such bleak prospects would we be so circumspect?<br /><br />A truly hauntingly great movie.  Where's Viggo's oscar?

B003XWEQ1G|5.0|A GREAT MOVIE IS SPURRED ON BY INTERPRETATION OF SCHOLARS OF THE TIME THAT THERE MIGH BE A DIFFERENT ORIGIN TO A FAVORITE LEGEND. I FOUND THE MOVIE AND THE CONCEPTS BOLSTERED BY A DISCOVERY CHANNEL LOOK INTO THE LEGEND AS A SATISFYING LOOK AT A CHILDHOOD LOVE. THE DISCOVERY LOOK MAKES ALL OF THE MOVIES AND THE T.V. SHOW JUST AS MUCH FUN ONCE YOU SUSPEND YOUR IMAGINATION. THE MORE THE MERRIER.
B002YH6FO2|5.0|for me she is the last big time Major Female Artist. meaning she was a true triple threat and she covered a whole lot of bases. her influence is felt to this day. this debut album for me is easily her best and the vocals here showcase a Artist who was just starting out on a Career that would be timeless. in truth say what you want about her voice now, but the simple fact is that Whitney Houston never has to do another song and her place in music history was long ago secured. she  had that \\"IT\\" that so few acts ever get to and she also had the songs that complimented her range. She demonstrated on this Set that she could straight up Sing/Sang and the sky was the limit. it is cool to go back and see her rise. i remember starting out doing background vocals for Teddy Pendergrass and Jermaine Jackson. Her Mother Cissy sung with ELvis Presley and was good herself and of course Whitney's cousin Dionne warwick who had a very good career and run so with all that pressure you knew the stakes were high.<br /><br />this album more than delievered and became a standard. Mariah Carey,Christina Agullaria,Mary J Blige,Kelly Clarkson amongest others owe a whole lot to whitney Houston. for my Money Whitney is One of the Mount Rushmore's of Female Artists. this whole album started her Legacy and this set was the making of a Legend.<br /><br />very balanced material and her vocal range was smooth and on point.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I dont know if I am unusual or not, but when Im listening to new music, if the song doesnt catch my ear or pique my interest within the first 30 seconds, then the next track gets played. I dont know that's just me. And, I've always thought that most albums only had about 4-5 decent songs on them and the rest were just fillers. Well, when it comes to this album, I was proved wrong on both of accounts. There were just a handful of songs (out of 18) that just didnt do anything for me within the first 30 seconds and by far most of them are worth listening to. I especially enjoyed her songs with Ray Charles, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson, but then again I'm an old school kind of guy. This is an album of duets sung throughout her career over the past 10 years. Some of these duets, particularly Love Me with The Little Willies, leaves you wishing they would cut an entire album together. Other duets, leave you just asking `Why?'.  I've been a fan of Norah for a long time, enjoying her unique voice and comittment to pure music and voice. These aren't just leftovers from her past albums or merely Starbuck songs you gently brush away as you grab your mocha. These are glimpses into Norah's music mind and her diverse ability to relate to other genre's thru her music.
B003INBOEM|5.0|A perfect blend of humor, tragedy, and asskicking, this is one of the most enjoyable films in the genre that I've ever seen. The story is great, the cast is excellent, and the cinematography is gorgeous. Sammo Hung has choreographed some of the best action in years, during every fight I was slack-jawed with amazement. The moves are amazing and shot with a wonderful camera style that enhances the action instead of obfuscating it with too many cuts or confusing angles. Donnie Yen makes delivering a beatdown look as effortless as swatting a fly. The story is beautiful and gave me a perspective I hadn't seen before into the Japanese occupation of China. It's not often that one gets the opportunity to use the word \\"masterpiece\\" when talking about a martial arts film, but this one has definitely earned the label.
B003INBNXO|4.0|it's been a long time since I've seen a really good kung-fu flick. this one is definitely worth checking out!
1932100660|5.0|I learned about this book from a friend. After reading the book I changed the way I look at food and nutrition. The book is not preachy by any means. The author discusses various studies that were conducted all over that showed the benefits of eating a whole foods, plant based diet, and avoiding animal products all together. The result has been such that my wife and I are now vegan. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in nutrition, has questions about different illnesses, and more.
0740797719|5.0|Here I am an artist with three art degrees... and I never learned most of this information! My main degree was in painting and Illustration!!!! Honestly the most I learned was about cool and warm color and value - that's IT!<br /><br />This book is easy to grasp, pithy and organized in such a way that you can go right to the area you are interested in without having to scan the entire book. I learned more about how to use color and paint light in the hour I ravenously scanned through it than I did in all those years of college. If you wish to learn anything about painting you must have this book!<br /><br />It may seem such a simple subject, but how to set up a palette is one of the MOST confusing things an artist learns. Many times you just pick up a palette that someone else used and wing it until you get comfortable with it. Mr. Gurney actually takes so much of the mystery out of how to choose your palette of colors and how to work with what you have in that palette. This section ALONE is worth the price of the book!<br /><br />Also he explains how our vision works so we can be aware of it and make better choices in how we render color and light in our images - as well as how to pay attention to depth of field! I especially loved the comparison of a photograph and a painting from observation and how much you miss in the photo. Again, this information alone is worth the price of the book!<br /><br />If you are and artist looking to learn how to render an image realistically and believably, this book MUST be in your library. Mr. Gurney has taken information from many divers sources that would take another person years to gather if you could even find these out of print books and information, and he has put it all in a well-organized and easily read book that is so deeply appreciated for its clarity.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Gurney, for all your hard work. This book should become and textbook in any painting class!
1400079144|4.0|Brown continues luring one into the secrets and conspiracies that we just all can't seem to get enough of. The book is up there somewhere between The Da Vinic Code and The Last Cato or Labrynth.   Great night time reading.
B0018LX9T4|4.0|As a submissive girl I found the movie to be a wonderful portrayal of the BDSM lifestyle. Most think it is whips, chains and abuse. The freeing of Lee's character by allowing her to be what she was showed the opposite. It showed the true nature of the lifestyle. Both characters were allowed to be who they were and were so complimentary to each other. The movie showed how they lead each other and affirmed each other's roles. He felt guitly and ashamed of his wants and needs. She, by embracing them freed both herself and him. She was soothed and healed by his control. It was a wonderful movie. The acting was fantastic. I watch the movie frequently.
B004B4RCDE|5.0|Not a big Rhianna fan at all. I love more of the classics,but i was very surprised in a good way with this album.

B003UYUP58|2.0|Siddhartha Mukherjee, The Emperor of All Maladies.  Excellent in an interview, I ordered his book and placed it on the Kindle along with other general reading that interests me.  Unhappily, I do know Greek and Latin.  His explanations of the meaning in Greek of key terms is never quite right, and generally suggests that no one has checked the etymologies that he blithely gives.  Perhaps, one would guess from his name, his love of unnecessary adjectives and his near-malaprop elegant variations are annoying and inappropriate to serious non-fiction (even Simon Winchester is chaste by comparison), but actually he is as much American as Indian, as his speech and biography prove.  The book, at 600 pages, as he said, ought to have been half the length and omitted nothing while becoming clearer and more agreeable to read.  I'd just been reading Felix Rohatyn: Dr. Mukherjee ought to read it, too.  The book is disjunct and repetitive.  When it supplies standard data that Wiki also provides, it is much less to the point and illuminating than good Wiki articles are.  What is worse, I can't get at the Table of Contents!  I'm only half through, and I won't even finish it unless I can get to the last couple of chapters and see whether after all his mere tiring of the reader he actually has anything concrete and new to say.  S&S did a bad job of making this an e-book, besides everything else.

B000H7JCIW|5.0|I saw the first performance of this show at Radio City. What a night! Celebrities galore, if that's your thing. But really the only reason anyone was inside Radio City that April night was Liza Minnelli. And she tore the roof off the place.    I am so glad this show was finally released on DVD and that it is still in stock on Amazon. It is one of many career peaks for this perennially underrated performer. Yes, I know, she's regarded as the diva of all time, but very often her incredible artistry is just given passing lip-service. This woman is superhumanly talented. She needs no bombast. No eye-piercing strobe effects. No silly back-up dancers to distract you from the fact she can't dance--because she CAN dance, and beautifully.    The first act alone was simply Liza. Alone on the vast Radio City stage. And nothing else was needed. First number: \\"Teach Me Tonight.\\" Guts personified, then she was simply at home doing what she was born to do.    Liza Minnelli can do everything. There ain't many of her kind left (if there ever were to begin with).    She's touring again. If you can go see her live, DO IT. You won't regret it. I promise you.    This DVD (and the CD) would be great Christmas gifts for anyone who truly loves the performing arts. I am still thrilled I got to see Liza Minnelli: Live from Radio City Music Hall--\\"live\\"!
B003WTE886|5.0|The amazing price of this item helped to make a 7-yr old's birthday wish come true! She is a serious Taylor Swift fan and we have been listening to the album over and over again ever since. Her grandparents could not afford to spoil her as they normally do and I was able to steal it at a fraction of what it is going for now! I gave it to them and kept the tradition alive of her favorite gift coming from them again this year! Thanks Amazon and your great deals!

He also watches the weather channel, the history channel, and many other highly educational channels that give him a great perspective on the world.  He empathizes with his owner, and with his owner's daughter.  He wants to be a human in his next life.  And, at the end of the book, you will believe that he has accomplished that objective!!!

1439153663|2.0|This story had such potential. But as I began reading The Kitchen House, I struggled. I thought at first that I just wasn't in the mood for historical fiction. So I took a break and then went back to it. But I ended up struggling through the entire book. Although the overall story was interesting, the writing did not do it justice. The story is told mostly from Lavinia's point of view, with several chapters written in Belle's voice. But it didn't feel like these characters were really talking to me. I didn't feel their emotions. The story was told as if it were a third party telling it, rather than coming from the mouths of the people who supposedly lived through this.<br /><br />In addition, Grissom went too far with the tragedies in this story. Slavery, abuse (spousal, child and slave), torture, murder, alcoholism, drug addition, incest, accidental death, rape, and on and on. It seems that every tragedy that could be added to the story was included. If the author would have left out about half of the tragedies, it would have been a more enjoyable book. I get the point: slavery was bad and even the slave owners had major problems. But eventually, it got ridiculous and I found myself skimming to get through to the end.

0743506650|5.0|The first part of On Writing is a memoir that focuses on how the author found his way to becoming a successful author. He starts in his childhood, when he was an avid reader. Then he moves through his adolescence where his writing sometimes got him into trouble, and on into his adulthood when his talent was finally recognized. It's a fascinating and entertaining story that I enjoyed reading.<br /><br />The rest of the book is the author's advice to writers. He begins by describing the tools that every author needs to create his or her story, things like vocabulary and grammar. He also gives advice on plot, character development, themes and so much more. His advice is specific to writers of fiction, although there are many aspects that could be applied to other types of writing. I found it informative even though the writing I do is either business-related or reviews such as this. I'm sure I'll be thinking of his advice as I read and critique books. I expect I'll notice the quality of writing in more detail now.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in writing fiction. King offers some excellent advice. I especially recommend the audio version of the book, which is narrated by King himself. I listened to most of the book, but one of the disks didn't work so I had to get the paperback from the library to read those chapters I had missed. I preferred the audio version.
B00003CXSM|5.0|I love this movie. I have watched it over and over. I read a lot of negative reviews and for that reason I just had to write my own. I don't critique movies based on \\"technical\\" stuff but rather how I feel when I watch them. This movie is supposed to be a romantic comedy and that is exactly how I found it to be. For that reason...I give it 5 stars :)
0439023513|3.0|I read The Hunger Games last summer. It was actually one of my book club selections. I was surprised by how much I loved it because I'm not a big young adult fan. I read Catching Fire soon after, and enjoyed that as well, although not quite as much as the first book. So now comes Mockingjay, the final book in The Hunger Games trilogy. I was very excited to read it and find out how this story would end.<br /><br />I have to say I was a bit disappointed. While I enjoyed getting back to these interesting characters who end up in some very unusual situations, the story itself was not on par with the first book at all. Perhaps it was the lack of an actual Hunger Games inside an arena. There are battle scenes in this one, as the districts fight for freedom from the capital. And the capital resorts to its usual tactic of manufactured man-eating creatures and waves of deadly goo pouring down the streets. But it just wasn't the same without the arena.<br /><br />It's interesting because I read another trilogy over the past year: The Millennium trilogy by Stieg Larsson. With that series, the books got better as they went along. The last book in that trilogy was my favorite. But in The Hunger Games, it seems like Suzanne Collins took a great book and struggled to make it into a trilogy. The last book tied things up, but it felt like that was all it was doing.<br /><br />It wasn't all bad. As I said, it was fun to get back to the characters and the unique environment Collins created for this series of books. And it's nice to have an ending instead of wondering what is going to happen, as I have been for a year! It just wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be.
B003UESJGK|5.0|Love and Other Drugs is a touching mix of melodrama and romantic comedy that will hit the nerve in all of its parts.  Jake Gyllenhaal (Jamie) and Anne Hathaway (Maggie) are the leading actors of the film that appear to be opposites that attract, Jamie is a salesman who pitches and sells pharmaceutical drugs and Maggie is an artist who shoots Polaroids and works at a coffee shop, the tone that most romantic comedies follow, especially after one scene after another; the onscreen chemistry appears predictable.  However, that is not the case after an hour or so because of the well-written and executed scenes attributed to the critical and renowned work of the film's Director Ed Zwick that show an array of surprises and uncanny unpredictable banter that occur between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway.  Indeed, it is a whirlwind of an association as Maggie refuses to accept their arrangement as a \\"relationship.\\"  If one was to compare this movie to others, it may be a cross between a quasi version of Love Story and any Spencer and Tracy film.<br /><br /> With those elements in mind, there are plenty of raunchiness and humor throughout the film, but by the concluding scenes, a tinge of heart-wrenching moments make their appearance and movie viewers may find themselves wanting to reach out for the tissue paper.  And overall, this may be the type of film that may interest any moviegoer looking for a good laugh with as much heart.
0812550706|5.0|Ender Wiggin lives in a future vision of Earth with population bug-like aliens that are trying to wipe out the human race and population restrictions. Two children is the usual limit, but Ender's parents were allowed one more by the government because his sister and brother showed military promise, but had flaws that proved them to be ineligible for service. Ender was teased and bullied at school because of his status as a third child. He severely injured the main bully and was recruited into military training. Ender is only 6 years old. At Battle School, he is isolated and forced to push himself to his limits. He makes some friends and earns a lot of respect, but because he accelerates through the program, some of the other recruits resent him. It eventually gets to a point where those resentful students reach a breaking point and pose a danger to Ender. Can Ender rely on the teachers of the school to protect him or is this just another test? If he survives, can he go on to save the world from these aliens and at what cost to Ender?    Ender's Game is a classic science fiction novel that introduced an interesting, nuanced dystopia with unique characters. Most of the main characters in the novel are children. This makes the dystopia all the more compelling and chilling that children's lives are experimented with and sometimes discarded for a greater good. Ender is in a horrible situation from the start. He is purposefully targeted, isolated, and made to defend himself at six years old. As the novel progressed and Ender grew up, I would imagine him as an eighteen year old because of his mature thought processes and the way he progressed in the Battle School, even though he wasn't even a teenager yet. Each chapter starts with military officials discussing and sometimes arguing about his situation. They assess his progress and seem to have affection and compassion for him, but they continue to push him to be the greatest that they can make him, even at the expense of his sense of humor or his ability to make friends and be happy. Ender is a great character and I really felt for him throughout the book, especially in the shocking last chapter. Ender's siblings are almost as compelling as he is, but in different ways. Peter is older and a sociopathic meglomaniac, while his sister is sweet, but still very intelligent and manipulative. All three of these exceptional children effect the world in profound ways, whether it be good or bad.    The alien species that fight against the humans are another interesting aspect of the novel. Nothing much is known about them until the last half of the novel. These aliens were eventually seen as sympathetic. Heinlein used a similar race of aliens, but used their insect-like look and way of life as a way to distance them from the reader and make it practically impossible for us to relate to them. In Ender's Game, the conflict between human and alien came to be mostly because of an inability to communicate rather than an irrational hatred. It was nice to see a look at the other's way of life instead of just assuming they are evil.    I absolutely love this novel. The language is fairly simplistic, so people of all ages, whether they typically enjoy science fiction or not, can enjoy it. It has something for everyone: fight scenes, political intrigue, aliens, plus it still packs an emotional punch. I consider this required reading for anyone who remotely considers themselves a fan of science fiction.
B0044XV3QY|3.0|IMO, the success of Avatar has hurt films by helping to lower expectations and attention spans. I ask myself how films like Lawrence of Arabia, Spartacus, Ben Hur, The Red Shoes, Scenes from a Marriage, Ran, La Dolce Vita, even Vertigo or Citizen Kane would be received by today's filmgoer or for that matter if those type of films would have even been made if gimmicks like CGI and 3d had been around then?<br />It's impossible to spoil this film because it's been done so many times. Here's what it's about in a nutshell: Soldier infiltrates alien tribe. Becomes one of them. Kills ugly bird. Tames giant multicolored bat. Falls in love with alien girl.Has second thoughts about mission. Switches sides. Becomes leader of tribe, helps them fight off greedy humans. The end.<br />I told you you've seen it before, but, unlike Cameron's past films which always had little surprises at the end, the average filmgoer who's not a total moron can see how this'll end in the very beginning as soon as he hears Jake Sully's voice over, a la Harrison Ford's voice over in Bladerunner that this film, especially the director's cut, makes obvious reference to. The draw to see this film is not what, as in what happens, but in how, as in how they show this film, which is the best use of 3d in any film done since. The biggest problem with this film is that it leaves no room for me to decide what I want to think. This is about as black and white as you can get. The aliens, modeled after all cultures that were overrun and exploited by western civilization, are totally innocent and good, and the despoilers, the earthlings, are totally greedy and evil. in other words, the characters were too one-dimensional for me to care anything for. So when the film kicks into high gear and when the good guys and bad guys started going at it, I didn't care who won but who really cared because it just looked really cool anyway.<br /><br />I've noticed a sharp dropoff in quality American films in the last 2 decades since the emergence of cgi. Thank goodness for foreign films although I wonder how much pressure they are under to dummy down their films with gimmicks to get their movies seen over here. The actors are even getting worse, nowadays who needs to act? Just ask Vin Diesel, the Rock, Cameron Diaz, etc. Really, the main draw of going to see today's film is to have stuff thrown at you for 2 hours.<br />And another thing: Cameron was wrong! 3d has not \\"changed the world.\\" In fact, in case anyone hasn't noticed it, the only movies done (and will be done) in 3d are dumb braindead summer movies. That's right. Can you see someone 30+ going to see, let's say, The Godfather in 3d!!!; Citizen Kane, The Red Shoes, Dr. Zhivago, The Ice Storm, M, The French Connection, Belle Du Jour, Schindler's List, The Battle of Algiers, Battleship Potompken, Bladerunner, etc., (whew) in 3d? Can you imagine directors like Clint Eastwood (who seemingly has no taste for 3d), Pedro Amoldovar, the Coen brothers, Peter Greenaway, etc., alienating their fans by coming out with a 3d movie? And I'd hope that by the time someone hit their 30's they'd look to something more substantial to draw them into a film. I guess next they'll come up with 3d literature, like popups, words that pop off the page.<br />Lastly I want to say this: while I did enjoy Avatar as entertainment, I hope that it never receives recognition for being one of the great films in some future list. That would be a tragedy and a sad commentary on human evolution in my opinion, that we're moving back down the ladder. I CAN wait for Avatar 2!e emergence of cgi.

1439190275|5.0|I bought this book at a local bookstore (sorry Amazon) and I did so as a follow up to the original Atkins book.  If you actually bother to read this (as some reviewers who trashed this book clearly have not), you'll see that the diet advocates lean meats in moderation and emphasizes veggies and good-fats.  Bacon is actually something that this diet tells you to avoid due to the nitrates but if you just can't give it up, find a brand without the nitrates and eat in moderation (if you don't know what the word \\"moderation\\" means, go look it up!).    Here's my testimonial:  A few years ago, my weight was creeping up, as was my cholesterol and blood pressure.  Due to some old injuries that never healed properly, exercise was difficult and my doctor was yelling at me to shape up.  So I followed the doctor's advice - follow the American Heart Association diet.  So I did for five months.  I followed every word, took it VERY seriously and worked out 5-6 days a week for at least an hour a day (I gave myself 1 day off a week).  The results were a complete joke.  I had GAINED weight, by BMI went UP and I had to go up 2 pants sizes.  My blood pressure went up, my bad cholesterol and triglycerides shot up and my good cholesterol dropped like a rock.  I felt horrible.  The doctor again yelled at me and this time I decided to try something that had worked for a friend of mine - Atkins.    The first phase, Induction, is hard.  No question.  But I stuck it out and 4 weeks later, I'd lost 15 pounds, dropped a pants size, had energy I'd never had before and felt so much better!  Two months later, I was 30 pounds lighter, down 3 pants sizes and happy as can be.  After three months, I went back to my doctor who freaked out over the fact that I was following Atkins but once the test results came back, she stopped yelling.  The blood pressure had dropped, the cholesterol levels were better, I had lost weight, my BMI was down - all great things.    Well, that was then, this is now.  Since then, I've been injured (knee) which kept me away from the gym, work got out of hand (read as: too many extra hours, loss of work/life balance), bad foods started creeping back onto the plate, and I stopped paying strict attention to what I was eating. The weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and BMI are all back up (and I know it's all my fault).  So, I'm heading back to Atkins since I know it works for me.  This time though, my doctor is on my side and this book will remind me how it's done.  This diet isn't for everyone but I wish anyone looking to lose weight good luck!
B0036EH3WU|5.0|The Lost show is great!  This box set came with everything in a well packaged set, easy to access, and attractive.  Glad we bought it!
B002ZG999U|4.0|This is a very entertaining action film that doesn't pretend to be anything more than that.  With a great cast of action stars, this movie delivers on what it sets out to do.... save the girl, kill the bad guys, and blow stuff up.  Sit back and enjoy.
B003NFM3JU|2.0|This was a relatively faithful adaptation of the Charles Dicken's Christmas classic with a few seemingly added-just-for-3D visual sequences that were both annoying and slightly nauseating when watched in the non-3D Blu-Ray version.<br /><br />My problem with the movie is that the last thing we need is another faithful movie rendition of \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" perhaps the most filmed story of all time. I was expecting a Disney twist and, I admit, a bit of kid-friendly magic, a la Robert Zemeckis' endlessly charming \\"Polar Express,\\" and instead got Dicksonian-prose (baffling to most children and many adults) and the occasional uninspired 3D shot, clearly done just for the wow-look-at-that effect. (The shrinking to mouse-size scene was nonsensical, never explained, and clearly done solely to add in some more 3D moments.)<br /><br />My son was bored and occasionally frightened and I didn't see any point in using name-above-the-title star Jim Carrey, whom I usually despise, but here just found totally generic. (Again, unlike Tom Hanks, who inhabited every role he portrayed in \\"Polar Express.\\") There may have been much Carrey-esque scene munching and physical angst during the motion capture shoot that created this movie, but little of it comes through in the final onscreen product, which I found dull and not even touching, the very thing the original story excels so well at and why it's been a relevant tale for close to two hundred years.<br /><br />Tiny Tim is barely introduced, and only fleetingly referred to, so our feeling for his disappearance in Christmas future is limited--thus missing the heart and soul of Dicken's story--and Scrooge's redemption is rushed and not at all believable. He seems not a changed man, but rather a still-bitter man now frightened into acts of kindness by an impending demise that never before occurred to him, apparently, despite his wildly advanced age.<br /><br />Taken solely as an animated adaption of Dicken's tale, the movie is so-so, with a fairly faithful plot line, but with little to appeal to children outside the high-tech computer animation. As a Disney movie, the entire effort falls flat and even the much dated, far lower budget, \\"Mickey's Christmas Carol\\" does a much better job of introducing the story and entertaining younger children. This Carol just wasn't very special, and definitely not deserving of the Disney name. A big miss for me and my family., but with little to appeal to children outside the high-tech computer animation.

B003HGKJH8|4.0|modern psychedelic rock that brings together tons of great influences from the 60s and 70s into something fresh. consistently solid and interesting  arrangements.  the modern retro sound can push to the edge of over compression wall-of-sound, but rich with filters and  choice sonic accents.  lyrics not always the deepest, but sound cool. singer channels Lennon timbre at times. CD allowed access to some cool online content.   a favorite of the year.

B0042AEOG0|4.0|I listened to this album and said,  'I hear a good amount of the old Mariah that I miss.' The last of her albums that I liked this much was Butterfly.    She puts a modern spin on songs and to me it 'barely' passes as working (i.e. Auld Lang Syne). One song I feel she strained a bit (don't remember which one, was on the first listen of the album).    But can't complain too much, because the album makes me nostalgic for her work from the early 90's.    And I LOVE the 'O Holy Night' version she included that she did in South LA from her 'O Holy Night' music video in 1999. Been waiting for that version forever it seems...    Nice x-mas update album. Good job Mariah! :)
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I have to say this new version of an old classic is by far my new Christmas favorite.  I think the animation is off the chart and it is very well done.  I think that Jim Carrey was a great addition to this movie and it sets the bar for many other animated features to come.  Great movie
B003EYVXT6|4.0|A Great movie exploring the possiblity of human cloning and the complications in its execution.

B000WPAG1Q|4.0|There is no doubt this girl can sing and anyone who continues to compare her to Britney Spears is tone deaf. The energy level is so high it made me tense. I wish Christina would do more ballads and break up her performances with them to allow listeners over 30 years of age to catch their breath.  It would also be nice if Christina could connect more to her audience instead of just once during \\"Beautiful\\".  But I suppose these things will develop as she matures and with vocal ability like this she'll be around for a long time.

Probably would not order from this seller again, but I trust Amazon. As for the movie itself, it is wonderful.  I wanted in my collection of classics and for my grandchildren.  Too bad it did not arrive.
B00006ZXSK|4.0|I remember being 10 when I saw the trailer for this movie.  I'm 23 and I love this movie more now than I did then.  The characters are superbly cast, the acting is excellent from all the actors, the story is unique even as it tells a timeless story and presents complex themes.  The story is pretty similar to the basic Cinderella story we all know, except towards the end.  There is no fairy godmother save a scene with Leonardo Da Vinci but it didn't matter.  Angelica Huston truly was the evil stepmother, her jealousy towards Danielle was evident in the look on her face as her new husband dies says his last words to Danielle.  Drew Barrymore wins everyone's heart as Danielle who remains good hearted even as everything is taken from her.  Danielle is vulnerable, yet strong and rescues herself--so refreshing to see!!  One of the best movies of the 90s and very highly recommended!!  Only thing is the DVD doesn't have any special features besides the trailer.
B001UV4XFQ|3.0|I'm wondering how many other fans didn't like it as much as they thought they would? Especially if it was your favorite book too. I never thought I would be disappointed with the movie adaption, but I left the theater wondering why they kept Melissa Rosenberg on when she keeps messing up the movies. Twilight & New Moon were pretty good, but Eclipse could have been soooo much better. This is why I was disappointed:  1) The pace was choppy and it didn't flow right  2) The good scenes were not long enough (i.e. fight prep)  3) Bella did not shed a tear and she cried a lot in the book, especially when she realized she loved Jacob and then felt more guilty because of Edward  4) When Bella was kissing Jacob, they should have flashed to her thoughts about what her life would have been like with Jacob (2 little kids with dark hair running into the forest), etc. - so to me that scene kinda of left me deflated  5) Even the fight scene which was pretty good was not as riveting as it could be plus it was too short- i.e. not vampire body parts crawling to find other body parts. I also didn't like Edward almost losing & Bella coming to his rescue. In the book, she didn't know Seth was faking being hurt. Plus they didn't show how fast the vampires could move where Bella couldn't see how Edward was doing while fighting Victoria.  6) I miss Rachele L. as Victoria. The new Victoria was okay doing the sweet parts with Riley, but she was not scary like Rachele was.  7) There wasn't enough dialouge with Charlie & Bella like there was in the books - Charlie is a key character that they should show more  8) There were a lot of lines from the book this time, but sometimes the wrong characters were saying them (Carlisle was saying Alice's lines at the party). Plus I missed some like \\"go fetch a space heater\\" \\"A little stoned. Dr. Fang isn't sure how much pain medication I need\\", etc.  9) I thought MR completely missed the mark with Alice's party ... I liked the dialouge between Jacob & Bella in the beginning and then Alice telling Jacob about the army that was coming... I don't get why MR had to change it all up.   10) MR made Jacob too serious and not as funny as Stephanie Meyer wrote his character  11) I didn't like Bella's speech at the end... she would NEVER want to become a VAMPIRE without Edward. She doesn't realize until BD that she shined in the vampire world. Plus it 'was' a choice between Edward & Jacob... SM said she wanted Bella to see everything she would be giving up.  12) When they lead into BD, how will they explain that the Denali family bailed on them in Eclipse?  13) I think the first kiss between Bella & Edward in the first movie, Twilight, had more sparks   14) the tent scene was a pivotel part of the book, yet Jacob was sitting in a weird seemingly uncomfortable position and it was distracting - they definetely could have done it better    I enjoyed the audio book more than the movie if that's any indication. I did give it 3 stars because it had some good moments. I suppose if I didn't read the books, I may have enjoyed it more ...
0452295548|4.0|It was necessary to have quite a bit of the anatomical information but there were times where it made me lose interest in reading. However, to actually be inside the head of a stroke victim and truly understand what someone may need from others was a revelation. Jill Bolte was also able to demonstrate how the left and right brain really work by describing her experience and this has helped me with my spiritual journey. This is invaluable information gleaned and presented in a unique way.
B000JLPMPS|3.0|This is a reasonably competent oater, but why the critics went gaga over it is beyond me.  The first part seemed to me to be slightly pretentious and even self-conscious, not enough to make it a bad movie but more as a reminder that someone was trying to put together all the old movie themes (I will avoid the term \\"cliches\\") that he could think of.  The last half picked up steam a little, but then it got into pop psychology, or whatever you called it in the Old West if they were calling it anything back then.    I think you could give it a B+, but an Academy Award makes me think that a certain generation of reviewers had never seen a Western before, and thought that they were discovering a new genre.  Or maybe Clint Eastwood has a lot of friends.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I didn't know what I was missing! With the stock fan, 100% load CFD computations would take processor to 62 deg C within a few minutes with lots of fan noise.

B0015DROBO|3.0|This review will be brief and to the point.<br /><br />The plot(s) in this book were excellent.  I thought that it took some twists and turns that I just didn't see coming.  It could be that I was blinded by the grammar (I'm assuming this is due to translation), or all of the crazy promiscuity that seemed to envelope the majority of the second half of the book.<br /><br />Overall I thought this was a good read, I'd heard so much about this book that I couldn't resist purchasing it for the $5.00 or so that it was being offered at.  However, there were some references to Swedish culture that didn't register with me right away (had to look them up), but that's expected in a book converted from another language.  Also, in spots I thought the translation could use quite a bit of work - which is my reason for the 3 stars.<br /><br />Good book - I'd recommend it to friends and I'm sure I'll read the rest of the series.

NOT \\"I'm a free bit baby\\"! I love you Gaga, but if I can find an uncensored version of this CD, I'm returning and getting that.
B004498KPU|5.0|This DVD box set was a gift from a very special friend.I am truly blessed for this beautiful gift, and having all of MJ's short films in one box set. This DVD helps restore what has been lost, and that is our beloved MJ. He is found in our hearts for a reason and that is to LOVE and REJOICE in his work, and remember he has always loved us no matter who we are, or where we come from this I know to be true.<br /><br />When you watch these videos you can see a master at work, his loyalty to the fans, his artistic creativity and moves that only he can do.He has inspired us, made us laugh and cry, awakened apart of ourselves to know \\"we\\" can make the difference by looking at the \\"man in the mirror\\" I am greatful that love was put into this DVD collection, it is remastered, and is high quality. There are clips I have never seen before, \\"The way you make me feel\\" extended, extended version, and 'Gone to soon\\" I have over three hours of MJ videos at my finger tips, and yes the new one of \\"one more chance\\" This video shows a different side to MJ, in fact you verily see his face, but it still has a powerful message in it has do all of his videos.<br /><br />For instance, \\"bad\\" tells a story of how hard it is to get out of a gang, for one boy wanting to get on with his life, but the gang pulls him back. \\"Beat it\\" also shows how gangs life tends to bring about hatred, bigotry, and prejudice all for the sake of territory, and beliefs. \\"heal the world\\" this tells the story of healing pure and simple and the importants of putting our swords down, and embrace each others as if we are \\"One\\". It doesn't matter if we are \\"Black or White\\" we are all from the human race.  And my favorite \\"Will you be there\\" a story how our faith helps keeps us strong through the many storms in our lives, who better to relate this message than MJ himself. Trials, and Tribulation will you be there..\\"Come together\\" as much as I like the Beatles, Mj done this song his way and to me grabs your heart, and soul to watch a very sexy talented man bring together the gift of love. By honoring MJ is to honor his gifts, talents and message of hope, peace and joy..This collection is worth it in some ways it is a gentle reminder of who we are, and how MJ single handedly brought us all together to rejoice in his music and one another..Mend the wounds of hatred, bigotry and prejudice by uniting to one solid force..MJ soldiers of love...ry sexy talented man bring together the gift of love.

B002WCLG3Y|1.0|I heard what a popular game Halo is and was looking forward to the DVD, thinking it would be on the line of GI Joe or the Justice League.  Boy was I WRONG.  The animations is really basic, at first even watercolor like.  The story is told more in pictures than in actual animation.  I did not realize that this was several short stories (around 10 min each) and not a continuing story.  I stopped watching after DUEL, then I decided to give it another try and the watercolors went to Japanese animation type, but still very basic.  The stories were as basic as the animation and I never did finish the whole DVD.  I got it on sale for $2 and feel I wasted my money. Maybe hard core fans will get something out of this, for everyone else I say skip it.
B001C3L32I|5.0|This album is a unique musical journey through time and space in which the Moody Blues sculpted a gem that will endure the pass of time. The five super-musicians find themselves at the top of their either maturity, musical ability and consciousness of the moment they were living, their role on it, and the things they had and wanted to express with their music.<br /><br />With a vague and veiled, but permanent Christian message that seems to endure times and fashions, they all reflect about the same deep dilemmas, accompanied with either other members' top musicianship, creating a perfect body of art that sings and plays for itself as vividly now as back in 1971.<br /><br />The reason why I don't review each track separately or analyze the album musically  is that has been done superbly loads of times by other fellas in this site. You only have to read any of these other reviews and you'll find anything about the album.<br /><br />The only thing left I have to say, and no-one has said before as far as I know, is I really think there is a deep prophetic spirit in their music that makes that even tho' they didn't try to be specific at all about what they were singing about, you'll always find common links in nowadays world's situation and this music. Why? I think I've got the answer, but I can't tell you...
0439023513|3.0|I tried to avoid putting any spoilers in this review... I really did.  But, it's impossible.  I didn't feel like I could say anything meaningful about the book without talking about, you know, what happens in the book.<br /><br />If you haven't read it yet, if you've somehow been living under a rock, and haven't had this book \\"spoiled\\" for you already, heed my warning, and turn back now!<br /><br />That having been said...<br /><br />I loved the people and customs detailed in District 13. The extreme, rigid, scheduled life they lead in order to eke out an existence on the outskirts of Panem, made it clear that being rescued by them was not the answer to all of Katniss's problems. I had predicted that the third book would be when we'd see Gale get his chance to win Katniss back. It seemed like things might be going that way... but seeing Katniss so despondent at being separated from Peeta, I felt very early on in the book that Gale didn't have a chance.<br /><br />How about that crazy President Snow? He's so terribly creepy. The explanation of why his breath smells like blood happened so quick, it was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it kind of thing. His unexpected gift of roses as an intimidation tactic was brilliantly evil. Snow's lies, manipulations and half-truths really get under your skin.<br /><br />I was so very saddened to see Peeta mind-controlled by the Capitol. It definitely made his reunion with Katniss anti-climactic, to say the least.<br /><br />The ending! My gosh, I didn't see that coming. It makes a terrible kind of sense though. After fighting so hard, surviving the horrors imposed on her by the Capitol in the Hunger Games, the whole reason for Katniss to fight is to protect her younger sister Prim. When Prim gets caught in the crossfire and dies in the final battle, Katniss hasn't got anything left worth living for.  I think, in some ways, because their mom completely mentally checked out after their father died, Prim is more like a daughter to Katniss than a sister.  I was saddened to see Katniss vote to continue the Games. I can see why she does it, though. When Katniss votes, \\"Yes, for Prim.\\" it seems nonsensical until you remember that, with Prim gone, Katniss has got this mix of hopelessness, anger and desire for revenge. So, that's why she allows the Games to continue.<br /><br />For me, the very saddest part was the afterward, when Katniss talks about how she and Peeta are living by themselves in the ruins of District 12, still haunted by everything that's happened to them, and how, after many years, she finally gave in and agreed to have children. It seemed to me like she was just going through the motions. Yes, she survived the gladiatorial Games... but she's not really living, just existing. There's no joy in her life. Like Haymitch, she never really recovers from the ordeal she's been through.  Obviously a totally happy ending would be kind of unbelievable in such a dystopian world, but I hadn't expected things to end quite so grimly for Katniss... living in an empty town, in a loveless marriage, with a couple of kids that she was badgered into.<br /><br />In the end, Collins does beat the readers over the head a bit with her themes.  War is really terrible. Violence, also really terrible. The way the media manipulates the story is just terrible. Powerful dictators and despotic governments are, obviously, terrible. By the way, did I mention that war is terrible?<br /><br />Mockingjay is a powerful book!  I really enjoyed the whole trilogy.  But, knowing now that Collins is the kind of tricksy writer who likes to stick you with a \\"feel-bad\\" ending... I'll certainly have my guard up the next time I read something by her.niss vote to continue the Games. I can see why she does it, though.

B0043A0PXU|5.0|Annie Lennox is iconic.  Yes, her voice is begining to age, so are many great wines. There is a musicality to the collection that is rarely heard these days.  She has taken each song and made it a small journey. You must listen to each song fully before making snap decisions.  If you are beyond \\"ADD Pop music\\" give this disc a full listen.
9889979942|5.0|China As You've Never Seen It    Tom Carter's book , China : Portrait of a People provides an insight into the diversity and beauty of the Chinese people. These photos offer a look at the  people of China through the eyes of someone who cares. Tom's epic journey through China  resulted in a a deeply personal pictorial journal and I'm glad that he is sharing it with the world. This is a must read book for anyone who is planning to visit China. It will also make a great gift for someone who is interested in China .    All my life I had dreamed of visiting  China and recently I fulfilled that dream.  I'm teaching English at Liaoning Normal University in Northern China. Before coming to China. I had read many books on Chinese culture and  tradition. but then I came across Tom Carter's book at a friends house. Since I was preparing to go to China she suggested I take it with me. As I began to read the book , I realized that Tom loves  people as much as I do. His ability to capture the essence of a country through photos of ordinary people is uncanny. Through his photos we get glimpses of daily life for most people in China.     As I go about my daily life in China I see Toms's book reflected in the students and the people I meet on the street. When my friends ask me what I like most about China I always say \\"the people\\".  I have never been in a country where the people were so very warm and helpful. I'm looking forward to spending many years in China meeting the people and tasting the wonderful food.   '    PLEASE , DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET A COPY OF THIS BOOK.
B003L77GRO|3.0|Dexter is absolutely riveting.  My son lent me season 1 thru 3. I really wasn't expecting too much from the series.  Boy was I surprised. I then purchased season 4.  I watched it and then gave it to my son to add to his collection.  I am now watching season 5 on Showtime.  It is really addicting.  When season 5 comes out in DVD I will purchase it as a gift to my son.<br />Received the DVD this month (August 2011).  I was very disappointed with the Special Features.  The disc indicates that there are interviews with the cast \\"via E-Bridge Technology, whatever the heck that means.  I was unable to view these interviews which really ticked me off.  I reduced my rating by 2 stars because of  this rip off.  What are they trying to prove?
0670021652|1.0|In Eat, Pray, Love, Gilbert inspired readers by emotionally connecting with them through her personal triumphs and losses. In Committed, her constant bellyaching and condescending attitude distance her from the audience and bury the smattering of noteworthy discourse. By the end of the book, readers will feel more sympathy for her patient husband than the confused and pessimistic Gilbert.     The lack of authority and reliability from the author detracts from the more interesting features of the book, such as the conversations with married women from different cultural backgrounds. She only scratches the surfaces with her interviews and then quickly drops the subject, as if she doesn't know how to process the information. Gilbert readily admits that she is not a \\"professional academic, nor a sociologist, nor a psychologist, nor an expert on marriage.\\" The jumbled facts and figures presented throughout the book are interesting bits of trivia but also incomplete. For all her rants, interviews, and research, Gilbert achieves no clarity. She remains a skeptic until the end and concludes that marriage has changed throughout history and the dynamics of commitment differ between every couple. It required a journey throughout foreign lands and a year's worth of research to reach such an ironically noncommittal conclusion?

1596680296|5.0|This is the BEST book for learning how to knit [top down, one at a time] socks. As a self-taught knitter, I rely on books, friends, and online videos to help me learn new techniques. This was my primary resource for learning socks and I still refer to it often. The instructions are very clearly written with great supporting pictures.     The patterns are great. After choosing your yarn weight and finding your gauge, Budd helps you customize a basic pattern to make a variety of different socks (ribbing options, lace, stripes, etc). There are also a couple more interesting patterns thrown in for fun.     Highly recommended for beginner knitters or those new to socks.
B00405DUYO|5.0|Excellent movie and one wonders, why Jim Carrey in one of his best performances is officially not published with this \\"dramedy\\". Not your \\"typical Jim Carrey family movie\\", definitely an \\"R\\". Dont let \\"REGION A\\" scare you, this IS the right region code for the U.S.
0756665949|3.0|I was very excited to read this when I received it as a birthday present. As an avid Lost fan I was hoping for some interesting backstory on the characters that perhaps the writers had been unable to include in the series. While it's a great, comprehensive resource for the show, it's also poorly edited, with many repeating sentences, sentence fragments, and absent words. I'm also not sure it adds anything for any viewer who has seen every episode.

You get lots of footnotes which explain and interpret what the scriptures say and mean, and how to apply them to your life. You also get over 40 amazing illustrations, a big concordance, articles, maps, notes, and so much more. If you really want to understand the bible, then please don't hesitate; get the ESV Study Bible now! It has everything you could possibly want in a bible. You'll be hooked as soon as you open the first page, it's so awesome. Anyone that doesn't give this bible 5 stars needs serious help. Just ignore the small number of 1 star reviews and take a look at the tons & tons of positive reviews it has gotten, not just here at Amazon but everywhere. This is the one, folks! Oh, yeah, and let me point out that this bible is much bigger than it looks in the pictures. It's about the size of a large Webster Dictionary. So with that said, it may be a bit too big and heavy for pew use.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Sylvestor Stallone with 2 great franchises on his notched belt has finally come into his own as a consumate filmmaker with this brilliant western posing as an action film, 'THE EXPENDABLES'.  I never saw this film in the theatres and its probably better for it because the digital image on high definition DVD lets you see every action sequence crystal clear rather than blurred images.  With director of photography Jeffrey Kimball, Stallone has created the perfect testosterone experience by gathering the greatest action stars of the decade and putting them through seperate vignettes culminating into a climactic ballet of blood making the viewer panting for more.  And out of all this wonderful, blistering action, Stallone pulls off the greatest acting coup for Mickey Rourke as he slows the film down allowing Rourke to do a passionate three minute soliloquy on saving a life which not only shows Rourke's brilliance as an actor but Stallone's maturity as director and mentor to his actors.  With giving each action star except for second billed Jason Statham equal measure throughout its running time and a relentlessly evil performance by Eric Roberts, Stallone has delivered the best action film of this or any other year.  The DVD has an excellent audio commentary by Stallone and a great featurette on the making of the whole experience.  Highly recommended for action fans and lovers of excellent high octane rushes.

1593272200|5.0|A hardcover book, like a textbook.  This book provides excellent information about complex programming tasks in Linux, explaining standards, history and how things have evolved into their current form, along with where things are headed in upcoming (currently un-finalized and assumed) future standards.  It is thorough and comprehensive, and a MUST HAVE for anybody looking to do serious Linux programming.    That being said, the only real complaint I have is that in several sections the otherwise useful and relevant information is scattered out over several pages.  Would greatly prefer to have a synopsis section at the beginning of each chapter with a paragraph or two to refresh the reader's mind about the nature of those items then explained in greater detail within, and without having to sift through those dozens of pages per chapter to get to the right portion.    Still, there is no question about it:  Everything you need is there, it's just that sometimes you have to skip forward or backward several pages to get it all.
0307454541|1.0|I just finished ready The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and cannot understand why it is so wildly popular.  A mystery about murdered women who were tortured (graphically) by a sadist who is carrying on the works of his sexually abusive father. After hundreds of pages, the mystery is solved by a man who has sex with any willing woman and his tattooed partner who has sex with anyone!  Not to mention the pages of useless trivia that made my eyes glaze over.  I'm sorry I read it and I do not plan to read any of the others.

0060594896|5.0|Just about everything you need to know about achieving success in life, wrapped into one book. Simple if you boil it down (decide who you are and what you want to achieve, visualize it, believe it is possible, and then go do it)...but obviously infinitely tougher in reality.<br /><br />Thankfully, Jack not only shares a lot of his own wisdom, he draws in many others for insight. Great stories, great advice. You also get the idea that success is rarely luck. It is A LOT OF HARD WORK. And more, it is a lot of FOCUSED HARD WORK. First lesson, forget what everyone else defines as success.\\"

B00493AD74|1.0|AKA \\"mid. life. crisis.\\" and \\"get. over. yourself.\\"  As far as movie-making goes? Predictable and pure Hollywood-style suck the life out of any storyline this may have originally had\\" Pure smarm-horrible editing, ridiculous vignettes depicting characters \\"thinking\\", \\"contemplating\\"...  Julia Roberts seems to have a constant tear in her eye-so much faux \\"deep thinking\\" and reflection. UGH.  When the tears do fall, it is insincere, boring. Get ready to roll your eyes. When she decides to leave for a year...I almost wished the movie would just end there and we could all wave from the driveway.  The only positive thing...if there is one, about this movie...is that it was less than a dollar (putting the price point slightly above what we all should pay for this-free.)  I knew I was in for trouble in the opening scene when Julia Roberts's Eeyore-style narration, coupled with her riding a bike through one of her mid-life stay-cation destinations, that this movie was going to be just. plain. BAD.  In that regard, it didn't disappoint-the \\"bad\\" was a thread throughout the entire film, with several horrible crescendos involving her life decisions and advice from friends, flashbacks, dances with people that weren't really there...and more narration.  SO ridiculous.   Ok, granted, I have not read the book-but who cares?  A movie should stand on its own.  \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" certainly did what this movie could have done in terms of getting the best out of a book and creating for it a unique film version; even \\"Stepmom\\", which is, in my opinion, Julia Roberts finest hour, delivers this way-and it was also a good movie to boot.  Rent those!  Yes...  put on pajamas and drink tea and reflect on why 99% of us could never afford to drop out of life and buy homes all over the world, replete with bike basket and poorly-chosen soundtrack a la Pearl Jam?!   Oh, come on.  Someone needs to take Oprah out for lunch and introduce her to some real books-great stories, and beg her to stop giving a hand to the drivel that has turned into what people are calling a...(wait for it) phenomenon.  There are so many poignant life stories out there worthy of filmmaking.  Obviously this, in my opinion, is not one of them-or at least, it could have been treated in a way that left the shallow and thin angle out of it focused on the deep layers of the story itself.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I must say that when I first picked up a Brandon Sanderson book it was to distract me while I waited for the next book in the wheel of time series. Since picking up the Mistborn series I have blown through every Sanderson book I can find.     The Way of Kings is an epic start to any new series. Of all the first books of an epic series I have read lately, from Glenn Cook's The Black Company tales of the north, Robert Jordan's Eye of the World, to The Gardens of the Moon by Steven Erikson. The Way of Kings has surpassed each of these founding books. This only speaks of a great tale to come and I for once am happy to wait for the next book if BS continues with this quality of work.
B002ZG999U|4.0|Even for those who are fatigued by the loud, bloody, pyrotechnical messes, and absurd cloned plots of the past few years' thriller movies, THE EXPENDABLES  is bound to please.  Why? Simply because it is a parody of this genre, with a hilarious script of puns written by director and star Sylvester Stallone (with David Callaham, probably the one responsible fro sticking the story line together).  No one really takes this action flick seriously because of the fun the actors are having.<br /><br />It is reunion time for the likes of Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), knife pro Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial arts pro Ying Yang (Jet Li), rasty renegade Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Toll Road (Randy Couture), and Tool (Mickey Rourke) - collectively called The Expendables, biking through another impossible adventure.  The 'other side\\" (villains who are destroying a Gulf island include Eric Roberts, Paine (the impossibly huge Steve Austin), the good/bad puppet General Garza (David Zayas form 'Dexter'), and the general's rebel daughter Sandra (Giselle Iti&eacute;).  There is a lot of body destruction, firebombing, and breathless chases, and for an action drama it is very well paced.  But the pleasure of the film comes form seeing all the famous guys of yesteryear having such a great camaraderie.  There are even small cameos for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger! It is a fun ride with a lot of unexpected laughs as these men make fun of their past films and stereotypes!  Grady Harp, November 10
B003YY7BTW|5.0|The Backup Plan was hilarious, romantic, seductive, entertaining, sweet, and so much more! I laughed, I cried, and I fell in love. Alex O'Loughlin is sexy and an amazing actor, and Jennifer Lopez was wonderful as always. This movie is a MUST SEE (not for guys, it's a chick flick). There are very few films that have the elements of good acting, humor, entertainment, and romance; this is definitely one of them.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|A strange brew of partners, but a wonderful volume of music featuring the incredible and mesmerizing vocals of Norah Jones, \\"...Featuring Norah Jones\\" is a true treat for all seasons.<br /><br />The album begins with a smooth, soulful song \\"Love Me\\" from The Little Willies featuring Norah Jones... then moves into an alternative Indie-style \\"Virginia Moon\\" collaboration of Norah Jones and the Foo Fighters.  The styles are certainly a stretch from the other, but somehow Norah's voice ties it all together in a pretty little musical bow.<br /><br />Perhaps because it's \\"the\\" season, my favorite track is \\"Baby It's Cold Outside,\\" a collaboration of Norah Jones and Willie Nelson, followed by \\"Dear John\\" by Ryan Adams featuring Norah Jones.<br /><br />Any fan of Norah Jones will appreciate \\"...Featuring Norah Jones,\\" but any music lover will, too.  It's a fabulous, relaxing album full of surprises and magical vocals.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I did not think Taylor could match or top her \\"Fearless\\" album. \\"She's done,\\" I thought. \\"At least she was famous for a few years, and we'll remember some of her more famous songs.     Yup, she proved me wrong.     One of the lyrical geniuses of our time, Taylor Swift, has yet another smash hit, \\"Mine,\\" from her new album \\"Speak Now.\\"     The most beautiful song of 2010--so lyrically sound, and here is why:     \\"You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables  Left a small town and never looked back  I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'  Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts\\"     The introduction leads the listener to believe that the song is about a girl who does not believe in love due to a negative experience. Even though this may be true, the boy never finishes college, takes a risk, and possibly leaves the town for the girl despite her doubts.     \\"I say, `Can you believe it?'  As we're lyin' on the couch  The moment, I can see it  Yes, yes, I can see it now\\"     In the pre-chorus, her doubt turns into possible belief as she is on the couch with the boy.     \\"Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?  You put your arm around me for the first time  You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  You are the best thing that's ever been mine\\"     The chorus adds to her belief in love, as she reminisces a memorable moment she had with him \\"by the water.\\" Apparently her father was \\"careless\\" and possibly did not pay much attention to her. For the first time in the song, she admits that he is the love of her life.     \\"Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together  And there's a drawer of my things at your place  You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded  You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes\\"     Time passes and they are \\"taking on the world together\\" which may indicate that they are now married. Only after marriage does the boy find out that the girl she married is \\"guarded\\" because her parents did not have a great marriage. A possible separation or divorce is eminent.     \\"But we got bills to pay  We got nothin' figured out  When it was hard to take  Yes, yes, this is what I thought about:\\"     Her skepticism arises again when there is adversity in the marriage; yet, she resorts to the memorable event:     \\"Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?  You put your arm around me for the first time  You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Do you remember all the city lights on the water?  You saw me start to believe for the first time  You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  You are the best thing that's ever been mine\\"     She goes deeper into that memory and recalls the moment she began to believe in love as a possible concept.     \\"And I remember that fight, two-thirty AM  You said everything was slipping right out of our hands  I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street  Braced myself for the goodbye, cause that's all I've ever known  Then, you took me by surprise  You said, `I'll never leave you alone.' \\"     It is now clear that her parents did not stay married. The fighting escalates and the girl is probably now validating her doubts. The boy does something she does not expect and runs after her, saying \\"I'll never leave you alone\\"     \\"You said, `I remember how we felt, sitting by the water.  And every time I look at you, it's like the first time.  I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.  She is the best thing that's ever been mine.' \\"     For the first time, the boy speaks and he recalls that same memory she alludes to the whole song. Even now, he falls in love with her every time he glances at her. He finally admits that she too, is the best thing that's ever happened to him.     \\"You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter  You are the best thing that's ever been mine  Do you believe it?  We're gonna make it now  And Ican see it, I can see it now\\"     At this point, she finally firmly believes in true love, professing once again her love for him and asserting that she can finally see that they will \\"make it.\\"           Beautiful. Simple. Meaningful. With the divorce rate being as high as it is, this song reminds us of the existence of genuine love. How I managed to write this without crying, I don't know.     Thanks for reading!
B00275EHJG|5.0|recently watched again on dvd after seeing this movie in the theatres this summer. simply amazing. toy story 3 is  both hilarious and heartbreaking, my husband and i both loved it- laughed throughout the movie and cried together at the end.  buy it, watch it, be entertained. the best movie of 2010 in my opinion!!.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I actually pre-ordered the \\"Burlesque\\" soundtrack and how glad I am that I did. In my first listen, I was delighted beyond expectation with Christina's renditions of the Etta James tunes and also impressed with the tunes that she wrote for the soundtrack. Cher's opening tune, \\"Welcome to Burlesque\\" was so well suited for her contralto voice that like her looks, just seems to get better and more smooth with age. Cher's performance of the Diane Warren tune, \\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me\\" in my opinion is one of the greatest recordings of her career. Diane Warren did an impeccable job on the writing and after listening several times, can't imagine hearing anyone but Cher singing it. After hearing the soundtrack several times I was compelled to see the movie 2 days after its release, and once again, could not have imagined this soundtrack to be so well supported by such a film that has all of this enjoyable music, but a movie that keeps your attention and you feel the theatre with that feeling that lacks so much these days. Just saw a musical and left with a feel good feeling that really takes you back. I will continue to enjoy this soundtrack for quite sometime and already am anxious to see the film again!
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|As a life-long Eric Clapton fan, it pains me to say this is one of his worst releases. I understand that the record labels want their artists to come out with new product regularly (especially when that artist has a large fan base that will buy almost anything he creates), but Clapton is a big enough star so that he should set his own terms and only create a new collection when he's inspired....and he clearly wasn't in this case.
B002ZG9774|5.0|A friend of mine really wanted to see this so, reluctantly, I went with... To my great surprise I really liked it - A Lot!!! I just got on the list to be alerted when it becomes available on Blu-Ray. The choreography and eye-candy is really outstanding. The music is really good too. Prior to this I was not a big fan of Christina Aguilera but now realize that she is truly a great singer. I also think that Cher is a great singer and actress, but personally don't like the sound of her voice so that would be my only disappointment with this movie. Still Cher does a great job and I enjoyed her perfomance nevertheless.
0395754100|4.0|ABOUT THIS COLLECTION<br />I bought this collection out of nostalgia. But for my daughter I'm getting these books as separate volumes. It's definitely, as the front cover indicates, a \\"Collectors Edition\\" book for adults: very heavy and with thin pages.<br /><br />ABOUT THE CURIOUS GEORGE STORIES<br />I was born '71 and loved all the books that are in this collection. I don't remember how old I was when we started reading them, but I remember them well. I was and am sensitive and empathetic to a sometimes unhealthy extreme, and I love animals, but I wasn't affected negatively by anything in the stories. Some reviewers feel they aren't appropriate, or have said their children reacted badly to them. As always, try them on your kids at the library first! As for our family, my 3 yr old daughter loves the original books as well as the stop-motion animated versions of \\"Curious George\\" and \\"CG Goes to the Hospital\\" ([[ASIN:B000BT994I Curious George (Collector's Edition)]]) which follow the books scene for scene. She is very empathetic also and hasn't react badly to anything in the stories (and she DID react badly to something in a Care Bears movie!). Incidentally my family liked that stop-motion video as well as the PBS TV series WAY better than the modernized movie [[ASIN:B000GIXEWC Curious George (Widescreen Edition)]].
0486478998|3.0|This book is manifesting tailored for the Republican executive type. Nothing wrong with that. I read an older edition of this book and did get something from it. But it also set me back in my manifesting as well. Why? Because it takes an overly mentalistic approach to manifesting and if you love to think, think, think, this book is for you. I am a thinker, one who is very discerning about the information I take in and receive. At the same time, thinking can only do so much. At some point, you are just rehashing old opinions, talking to yourself unproductively. Yes, it's good to DISCERN and apply thought to examine things when necessary. At the same time, one can overdo it where it offers you no additional value. Just like everything else. The main premise of this book is that you can think or visualize your way to manifesting your goal. But if your underlying beliefs are the same, what good are empty words/thoughts? You can tell yourself \\"Money, money, money\\", but if you have fear about money, you will not manifest it. In the earlier version, the author recommended that you \\"banish\\" those negative thoughts as if they were the plague. But that only made me more fearful as if one negative thought would make bad things materialize right away. I later learned how unfounded that fear was. However, the author is not helpful in his fear-inducing tone.     This book is great if you want to learn about how the law of attraction can be applied in different situations. There are many inspirational stories of people healing or finding success in their life, improving their relationships, etc. And he does give you a good understanding of how we become programmed to think a certain way. However, it is not a good book to help you learn about the law of attraction and how to apply it. It's emphasis is too much on thought and not on feeling, which really helps you to manifest. You can't think or talk your way to manifestation unless the underlying feeling is one of knowing that it will happen.     There are much better books out there that take a far gentler and more pleasant approach to the art of manifesting your desires. They are [[ASIN:1615775285 Telementation: Cosmic Feeling and the Law of Attraction]], [[ASIN:1932073221 Creating Money: Attracting Abundance (Sanaya Roman)]], and [[ASIN:1401907997 Ask & It Is Given]]. I have reviewed all these books and so you may refer to them if you'd like to learn more. Manifestation should not be hard, but easy. There is no reason to take such a difficult approach to something that can be achieved easily.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|..if you already have Avatar you DONT need to buy this version. it only has 15 minutes of added scenes put back into the movie..omg 15 whole mins yipeeee!. i thought they were gona put 40mins back in?...anyways pass on this unless you like the behind the scenes stuff which i dont cuz knowing how its done ruins the magic of the movie for me.
B000SGSU58|5.0|I  have most of the harry bosch novels in hard cover. I've been starting to add them to my kindle to have handy to read again, and donate my books to the library.<br /><br />Now the book prices are going up and up..........why? For example, I have Nine Dragons, in hardcover.....why should an e-copy cost $14.99? Several books I have purchased lately seem pricey, what's the deal?<br /><br />Guess I'll have to keep the bookcases around until the publishers realize we can't afford to buy the new books anymore either!!!<br /><br />so here I am, a consistent buyer, nothing today I feel comfortable paying full price for twice!!!<br /><br />Bev
B00428CPUY|5.0|I now own all 3 crossroad concerts and this one didn't disappoint me unlike what some other reviewers may have commented. I especially enjoyed the Derek trucks / Susan Tedeschi band. I thought a long time ago that they should play together. It's magic! It looks like Eric is trying to look younger by growing his hair long.
B002N5N5QQ|4.0|If you watched the first season you can buy this one right away, the new plot is fresh, it's has a way of not being locked to whatever happened  on the first season but still fells like the natural course of events.. Wont be disappointed..
B0024FAR5M|4.0|Aboslutely got hooked on series one, have purchased series 2 and have order in for series 3.  Hubby and I do not speak a word when we watch!  Fantastic!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This Series is awesome, will not disappoint, lots of blood, guts and great story line too, lots of twists and turns. Sad that Andy (Spartacus) had cancer, but glad to know he is OK, and season 2 is in the works; also check out the new prequel SPARTACUS: GODS OF THE ARENA  January 21st 10pm!!!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|As a connoisseur of Austen books and movies, I was both thrilled and disappointed by this one.  They strayed from the text a bit too much for my taste - demerit.  They rattled off their brilliant lines too quickly - demerit (particularly Keira Knightly).  I was disappointed by her performance overall, although I do like her aesthetically and even cerebrally as Elizabeth.     On the plus side - Matthew Macfadyen made a wonderful Darcy.  Also the cinematography was absolutely lovely, as was the artistic direction.  I felt I was in the right place at the right time, and the costumes and scenes were charming and realistic - not too clean for Olde England.    Overall a good nights entertainment - but not up to the BBC version.  Of course...
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Just loved the movie!  What emotion and heartfelt love between man and dog. Can't believe we didn't hear more about this movie. Perfect for dog and animal lovers!
B004ASVS0E|5.0|Make no mistake about it...THIS is a Christmas cd that will be on favorite lists around the world! Annie Lennox has brought a new, contemporary sound to these mostly classic songs of the season.  The familiar songs are utterly engaging and fresh, and the new songs are stunning, with powerful vocals and unique instrumentation blending the sounds of both the pagan roots of many Christmas traditions and the most contemporary sounds of today's rock and pop vocals.  It is simply a brilliant collection of songs that demands repeated listenings to fully appreciate!
B001AQO3QA|1.0|[[ASIN:B001AQO3QA Alien Anthology [Blu-ray]]]    As many of you may already know, there are two major controversies surrounding this video release. The first revolves around the pricing of this item and unmitigated greed of the movie studio that issued it, and the second is an incompatibility issue with these DVDs and many players from 5 of the most prominent producers of Blu-Ray players in the world - in a word: unplayable    Because of the blatant over pricing of this product on the Amazon USA site and claims made by other reviewers that the UK release of this same item was not having the same incompatibility problems experienced here, I purchased this set from Amazon UK. In effect, at the time I made the purchase, I saved about $30.00, but there was a major catch that had not been clearly outlined - the cost of returns.    I have a Sony BDP-S570 Blu-ray Player, which I purchased new, less than 6 months ago, was from their current line, fairly high end, is running the most current firmware release, and is not listed by Amazon USA as one of the machines that should have a problem with this set of DVDs. However, I was unable to play any of the discs I received. When attempting to play these discs I would get to see the \\"Blu-Ray Disclaimer\\" screen and what I call the \\"Hey look at us - we are the greatest movie studio in the world\\" screen, and then nothing else, no matter how many buttons were pushed, cables switched or options tried or how many times the discs were inserted & removed or the equipment was powered off or restarted, including unplugging from the power supply.    I finally gave up and followed the Amazon UK return process, which allows for an item to be either returned for a replacement or a refund. Well, given the current incompatibility problems and my own experiences to that point, there was no way I was going to go the replacement route and risk wasting more time only to end up with another defective set of discs. So, I requested a refund. Here is where the catch comes in - irrespective of which choice one picks, the policy says it is up to the buyer to pay for the return of the item, and Amazon UK will reimburse the seller for those costs if they find that the problem with the item was a product defect or was damaged through initial shipping. I returned the DVD set in the same box I had received it, in pristine condition and using the same method used to ship it to me, the postal service. I used the least expensive rate offered by the USPS, and it still cost me $14.20 for the return. Amazon UK suggested the item be returned with insurance and tracking, but the USPS said that would require me to use First Class Mail, and the minimum cost for that would have been more than $35.00 (Luckily for me, I did not choose that route).    Nine days after mailing the set back, I received several emails from Amazon UK declaring that they had received the item, telling me they had issued me a refund, and giving me the details of that refund. Firstly, they did give me a full refund of the purchase price, which they broke down and said included their cost of $5.18 to ship the item to me. They then went on to tell me that they had issued me $2.08 refund to cover my shipping costs - that is over $12.00 less than what it had actually cost and even $3.10 less than what it had cost them to ship the same item to me, using their special bulk shipping rates. Basically, what this means is that I have wasted almost 3 weeks of my time to get and return a clearly defective item, no fault of my own, I have nothing to show for it and it has cost me more than $12.00 for the experience. Needless to say, it is highly unlikely that I will ever be purchasing anything else from Amazon UK given the risks involved. You can buy at your own risk!    Finally, come on Amazon, do you really expect us to swallow this huge pile of manure about the disc problem being just needing to upgrade the player's firmware. My player is not even on your list, it is already running the latest firmware and I have over 450 Blu-Ray discs but this one is the only one I am having a problem playing. Do you really expect me to believe that 5 major Blu-Ray player manufacturers are responsible for this problem, but the greedy, sleazy movie studio that produced this piece of crap is not responsible for anything. Are there other new major Blu-Ray releases from other studios having this same problem, to the extent that you are placing disclaimers on you site pages for them too? If this Blu-Ray set had been released by Microsoft, everyone would be shouting at the top of their lungs and pointing their fingers at Bill Gates. If this was a new car that would not run on the current gasoline, would you be asking all the major refiners to change their formulas so that this one new car could be sold and used?  There are standards in place for a reason - why are you ignoring them?     Greed is clearly alive and well in the 21st century. Can you say OINK? - OINK! OINK! OINK!
0810993139|5.0|This book was a great hit with my 6-year-old grandson who read it rapidly and with laughter.  He plans on keeping the book and re-reading it.  He has asked for the rest of the Wimpy Kid books and is exploring other chapter books.  He has discovered the joy of reading books on his own.  This is a priceless gift.
051788710X|5.0|I'm not new to dreamwork but I've only just started reading this book. I read a bit of the intro but skipped over most of the narrative to go strait to the first and second sets of dreaming instructions. I was pleasantly surprised to read some dreaming insights and information in the book that I've not read elsewhere. More importantly, I am impressed with the raw power of dreaming awareness behind the book. Example: Before I even read a word from the book, I slept with the book next to my head. That same night, I had a lucid dream (deliberately inducing lucid dreams is one of the reasons I was interested in the book). The next time I slept with the book next to my head (maybe a week later), I had read the second set of instructions involving dream incubation and some other elements. I had also started a new spiritual journal and had written the word \\"consistency\\" just as a general objective in life, not really thinking of dreamwork. That night, I experienced an unusually high level of \\"consistency\\" in my dreams. I dreamt the same continuous dream all night, even though I woke up once or twice between segments. That is new for me.<br /><br />I have never heard of this author before and I've only read 9 pages so far. But my two dream experiences so far--both of which happened immediately after some interaction with the book--indicates to me that he has achieved some level of dream mastery and captured that energy in these pages. I'm excited to work with the rest of the book. Plus, I got an AMAZING idea that was inspired by the work.
B001HMSFFC|4.0|Great movie. I like the concept of Mr. Big not being the center of the movie. I also like that the other ladies are given a point of view. Samantha is a great character and I love that she was given the opportunity to reek havoc.
B00003CX8Y|3.0|Searching for a Christmas gift for my niece I thought I found the perfect gift with this Disney dvd. However, while it is shrinkwrapped and unopened, there was no outer artwork which is standard in Disney dvds.
B001P2IRN4|5.0|This 2-CD recording of Verdi's Otello from MYTO, a Milanese company noted for its issues of historic recordings, has come up with a real classic, a 1938 live recording from the MET, with Giovanni Martinelli (Otello), Lawrence Tibbett (Iago) and Elisabeth Rethberg (Desdemona).  The re-issue dates from 2005, and at a more reasonable price than many other MYTO releases.<br /><br />What a revelation !  Vinay, del Monaco, Vickers, Domingo, each with their own unique voices and interpretations, are all superb.  (Forget Pavarotti, an embarrassment to say the least).  None of them however quite match Martinelli's intensity and musicality, be it in love or hate.  And Tibbett's Iago is, without question, unsurpassed.  For me, the great discovery in this recording.  Rethberg portrays a delicate Desdemona, loving, trusting, yet strong-willed.  All three sing the notes as written down by Verdi, without some of the added embellishments allowed in more modern versions.  And Ettore Panizza, conducting the MET chorus and orchestra, is a lesson in restrained tension throughout.<br /><br />One note of caution.  This recording has a lot of background scratching and clicking noises as if it was transferred from old 78 rpm discs despite it being a live performance.  A minor distraction for those who are familiar with the work.  Here, they can hear a trio of legendary performers of opera, Italian, American and German, interpreting the roles of Otello, Iago and Desdemona, in Verdi's penultimate masterpiece, but an hindrance for those who are new to the opera.  This MYTO recording is for listeners who already have more modern versions available, and want to hear Martinelli's justly famous portrayal of the tragic hero.  Indeed, a splendid revelation !

0061854549|5.0|Undecided whether to buy this one or not? Just answer one question:    \\"Have you ever read anything from Dan Ariely?\\"    If the answer is no, please invest your money and time on this one, and do it as soon as you can please!! His insights and stories are just mind blowing!! As a plus you'll end up know yourself a little better in a more \\"scientific\\" way (many of his observations are empirical but do have degree of scientific rigor). Sometimes I felt the book is too long but it's not impossible to finish reading. If this is the candidate for your first Dan Ariely book, GO FOR IT!    If the answer is yes, please go look for something else, Dan is very repetitive, if he could retell the same story but focusing on a different aspect of it the book would be a good choice but it seems he can't, and he will retell the same story (believe me) in almost the same way, in the end it becomes a bit exhausting.    Overall, it's a good and interesting theme covered by someone who truly knows what is going on, but if have read Dan before it can become boring really fast.
B000W1V5OC|5.0|Excellent -- was all I had heard it was and more -- Love this group and am sad Tarja and the band separated.  They were one of a kind!
0385493622|5.0|It's the second book I've read by Simon Singh and he leaves me with the same sentiment: how can someone turn such complex themes into great stories so accurately?     Well, if you intent to know, buy this one an the other book by the same author: \\"The code book\\". There's no overlapping between them and the chronology and subjects covered on both books are **VERY** easy to follow even if you're a newbie. The Fermat problem is very interesting on itself but Simon transformed it into a complete experience with love stories, in depth historical background and political and technological breakthroughs this problem involved. There's also a plus: he does that in under 300 pages which pretty amazing by itself. 400 years in 280 pages, that's what you get for the time invested on this book.    My recommendation is: GO FOR IT ***NOW*** you won't be disappointed.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|I've had this disc about a week now and it is one of my favorites. A wide range of music is played on the CD, most at a slow tempo. Clapton's version of Autumn Leaves is really quite good. I especially enjoy his guitar solos in the middle and the last 1.5 minutes of the song. Very tasty. He released a live version of the C. Chaplin song \\"Smile\\" in the '70's which I really like. Maybe he'll record an all-standards record in the future. If you liked his slower tempo J.J. Cale covers, you'll like this one. Highly recommended.
0517548232|5.0|This book presents the basics, the interactions between demand and offer. It's a very short book (200< pages) and is the author has a VERY liberal approach to economy. If you want to read about the other side of the coin go for \\"Predictably irrational\\" and you'll contrast the views and theories on this book very easily. This one is worth every penny.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|First of all... I LOVED Dr. H when it was online...  And even on DVD it is great. It loses little of its charm. (Of course the Vlogs looked more realistic when watched online)  But that's what it is, on DVD... The extras are fun but meagre... The Commentary Musical is... hard to describe. It sounds a bit forced at parts and the singing makes it not so easy to understand all the commentaries, but still a very fresh and nice idea.  However there is one big Minus for this release (hence only 4/5 stars)  The subtitles...  Being German I was amazed and happy when I read that there would be German subtitles so I would be able to show it to my friends with fewer understanding of the English language...  We had a friend over a few days after the shipment arrived...  We decided to switch the subtitles off then after barely 2 Minutes into the Movie...  It was atrocious! Grammar mistakes, spelling mistakes and translations that looked like they had just thrown the text into any online translator and what they got out, they've put on the DVD.  I was a bit disappointed to say the least... Sure it makes the movie a bit more understandable for people who don't speak any English... but with a little effort, or someone who knows German, they could have just proof-read it at least once...  It seems they didn't...  So I really recommend watching it without Subtitles... at least without German ones... I'm not sure about the other languages, but I suppose there won't be much of a difference.
1416972250|5.0|Hiighly recommend reading this book.  I actually liked the last two books better than the first.  I love the way the author allows the reader to engage in the lives of multiple characters.  In addition, I'm a sucker for romance and this book definitely has that.    For any parent who is reviewing the comments you should know that the series includes a homesexual story line of one of the teenage characters.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I received a copy of this CD, Featuring Norah Jones, to review from the One to One Network. I enjoy listening to Norah Jones and the prospect of hearing her sing with Ray Charles, Willie Nelson,Sasha Dobson, and  others was exciting.   After listening to this CD, I was a little disappointed.   It was the mix of songs that I didn't like, or rather the order of the songs. Several songs have a mellow easy song to be enjoyed as background music while having dinner with company.  The hip hop style was next, followed by mellow songs. I would have liked the CD more if I could  play mellow sounds  during dinner and the hip hop and other style of music later in the evening.

I'd rather have spent the time and money on a bad dinner somewhere.  I couldn't finish it, if it was a plate I'd have sent it back to the kitchen........
B0014BEDBQ|4.0|I wasn't that big of a JT fan until I'd seen this show. He has to be one of the most talented entertainers in the world. Everything in this show was nothing short of perfect--the dancers were tight, the vocals were incredible (especially considering his dancing at the same time), the entire band was top-notch, the general theme of the show was original, and the crowd loved it. It's on the top shelf of my collection, and remains one of my most-watched DVDs I own.<br /><br />THEN, I finally put together a 5.1 surround system. I was excited to finally listen to the surround mode instead of the normal stereo mode. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Two words: subwoofer channel. The \\" .1\\" in 5.1 is GROSSLY insufficient. The first song is \\"Futuresex Lovesounds\\", and has that cool synth riff to start it off. I expected the room to be vibrating.  To my surprise, it didn't sound right at all.  I thought something got messed up--maybe my receiver was set in the wrong mode, or the subwoofer got turned off, or a cable got disconnected or something. I must have restarted the song 4 or 5 times changing settings trying to figure out what was going on, and eventually let it play through. EVENTUALLY, I FINALLY heard a wimpy little kick-drum come through the sub, alone. That's it. My sub ROCKS my house for other DVDs (Transformers was incredible), but is barely used for this show.<br /><br />I DO love sub, but understand when the experts tone it down a little so that it doesn't distract from the rest of the show...but this is not rock 'n roll, it's not country--IT'S POP. It's SUPPOSED to have synthetic sounds and is SUPPOSED to sound \\"fake\\" sometimes. Sometimes I wish that some of the \\"experts\\" would retire with their Yanni and let someone else do their job.<br /><br />More recently, I purchased the Blu-ray edition of this show, hoping it would have a resolution--no luck. I will continue to play it in stereo-mode and let my receiver split up the frequencies. To me, it sounds a lot better.
B002ZG98PA|5.0|Disney is very unpredictable. They crank out the movies; some great and some not so great. But their animated movies are a little more trustworthy; most of them are brilliant family fun. \\"Tangled\\" may perhaps be the best Disney Animated production yet!!    Tangled is the story of a girl named Rapunzel (played by Mandy Moore), who was kidnapped as a baby and put in a tower, where her \\"mother\\" (played by Donna Murphy) takes care of her, telling to stay indoors, where it is safe. Now, 18, Rapunzel's dream is to see (up close) the mysterious floating lanterns that are released through the sky on HER Birthday each year. Her mother forbids it. And thus enters Flynn Ryder (played by Zachary Levi). Flynn Ryder is a wanted thief who stole the crown of the long-lost princess. He seeks refuge in Rapunzel's castle while her mother is away. Thus begins a long adventure; seeking the mysterious floating lanterns, escaping palace guards and evil captors, finding true love, etc.    \\"Tangled\\" is full of intense adventure and roll-on-the-floor humor, as well as quotable lines and memorable songs.   Rapunzel and Flynn have great chemistry, clashing and blending in the perfect way.  Secondary characters like Pascel the chamelion and Maximus the horse add so much feeling and humor to the movie.    One of the things I love about \\"Tangled\\" is the depth. The 'bad guy' isn't some large sea monster or scary witch, she's a little bit more subtle, a blend of good and bad.  The scenes switch from suspenseful, to romantic, to funny, to intense, without a single boring moment.  This unforgettable romp is great for all ages, and a brilliant addition to the Disney Princess Movie collection.

0316069485|4.0|We enjoy courtroom drama, and therefore rarely miss a novel by the likes of Grisham, Turow, or Martini. We're also very fond of Connelly's writing, and in \\"Reversal\\" found a drama most of which indeed occurs before the judge, as a 24-year-old murder case has been dismissed and is being re-tried due to new DNA evidence. In a very unusual move, the DA has asked defense attorney Mickey Haller, a character known best as the \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" (for using his Lincoln town car for his office!) to take the case as a special prosecutor. He does, and soon finds himself paired with ex-wife and assistant DA Maggie McPherson, and with the famous detective Harry Bosch, leading man of most of Connelly's works. We're fairly sure as readers that the guilty party is still guilty, but the trial machinations and strategy, much of which we are privy to by way of Haller and his ex's running commentary, make for a fascinating read. A good tale is marred only by an ending that to us was spoiled by introducing new material right near the end that never gets resolved. Connelly hardly needs one book to pave the way for another, so we question his motive for that ending. Otherwise, maybe not the author's greatest nor most suspenseful outing, but an entertaining read nonetheless.
B00000AF98|1.0|Awful.  Almost as bad as Hot In The Shade.  80's hair/pop/pretty boy metal was all forgettable and really embarrassing for rock in general.  Kiss should apologize for putting out this trash.
B0018LMZO4|4.0|Ah, a definite classic from my growing-up era. Great Album, but I'm not sure about the so-called extra tracks that are on this cd. Personally I would have been satisfied with just the normal album tracks, but for the price....excellent value
B000P2A256|5.0|The second album from Maroon 5 is my favorite of theirs. It is different from Songs About Jane, which I never got much into. (Except for the ones you hear on the radio.)<br /><br /> \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\", \\"Not Falling Apart\\", \\"Story\\" and \\"Infatuation\\" are my favorites. \\"Wake Up Call\\" and \\"Can't Stop\\" are both interesting. \\"Little of Your Time\\" and \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" are upbeat and fun. It's interesting that most of these songs are about love gone wrong. Either cheating, breaking up, or losing someone.<br /><br />I'm glad I decided to try Maroon 5. I might not have if \\"She Will Be Loved\\" wasn't on the radio. There really isn't a song on this album that I don't like!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|If you liked Avatar, you should get the 3-disk collection.  I have heard some say to hold out for 3-D, but I saw it in the theatres in both 2-D and 3-D versions - the 3-D version does not add enough to make me want to wait for it.    In the 3-disk set for Avatar, there are many extras worth getting for fans of the movie.  The 16 minutes added to the \\"Collectors\\" extended cut of the movie are very good, and do change my impression of the movie.    (If the change is good or bad, I'm not sure.  But I don't think the \\"Collectors\\" cut of the movie would have done as well in theatres as it makes the movie seem darker and more serious than the original.)    The beginning is very \\"Blade Runner\\"-esque, and you get to see the school and hear more of the story of why they shut in down.... ok, I don't want to give away too much.      The 45 minutes of deleted scenes are fun to watch.  There is a brief love sequence that was edited out of the movie (and it's not who you think).  And there are two very elaborate \\"tribal\\" dance numbers that are worth checking out.  On blu-ray, the movie and the soundtrack are great!
B0014VPFTA|5.0|An excellent album!<br /><br />\\"Gravity\\" is his most popular, thoughtful song in this album. It deals with the touchy subject matter similar to \\"Belief\\". They are both very well done and Mayer even said he knew he'd have to be careful with a song called \\"Belief\\".<br /><br />\\"Vultures\\", \\"Stop This Train\\", \\"The Heart of Life\\", and \\"Slow Dancing\\" are love at first listen for me. The guitar in the beginning of \\"Vultures\\" is great. \\"Stop This Train\\" is so touching. \\"Slow Dancing In A Burning Room\\" is an awesome title and an awesome song.<br /><br />There's the very popular \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\" and \\"Say\\" that are constantly on the radio but I think a few other of his songs need to also make a bigger appearance.<br /><br />All the lyrics and the guitar are meaningful and full of thought. The songs are very deep and relatable. John Mayer did a great job!
B003YUC2FE|5.0|I saw this Toy Story Collection while on-line just browsing for nothing in particular.  We also needed to replace our copies of Toy Story, & Toy Story 2, so we ordered this and it was exactly as advertised / showcased on-line, and for the price it was just plain AWESOME!  If you don't have Toy Story, or Toy Story 2, and you also need to buy Toy Story 3, you'd have to be crazy not to buy this product.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|Although enjoyable, I wasn't as impressed with movie \\"Across The Universe\\". I did enjoy the soundtrack though immensely. Jim Sturgess, Evan Rachael Wood, and Joe Anderson lead the musical.<br /><br />\\"I've Just Seen A Face\\" and \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" are fun to listen to. \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" is an interesting cover because it's taken slower but done very well I think and the one that was obviously different from the original.<br /><br />\\"Let It Be\\" is also a standout. Joe Anderson's cover of \\"Hey Jude\\" was nice. For Wood's songs, I don't think she had enough range for the songs they gave her. I think \\"Black Bird\\" and somewhat of \\"Because\\" let her show she could sing without a noisy background. Martin Luther McCoy's \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" was good and so was Dana Fuchs' \\"Dear Prudence\\".
B000M4RGA6|4.0|This is a movie about Harold Crick who is played by the hilarious Will Ferrell.  Harold is good at many things.  He excels at his job. He's a whiz with numbers.  He's not very good at life.  This is a movie about Harold Crick getting better at life by facing death.  This type of story has been used many times before but has been revitalized by Stranger Than Fiction's fresh approach.    Harold wakes up one morning and hears a voice while brushing his teeth. The voice isn't talking to him so much as it's talking about him. The voice is right about a great many things, and so when it says \\"little did he know that events had been sent in motion that would lead to his imminent death\\", Harold has reason to take it rather seriously.  Karen Eiffel, who is played by Emma Thompson, is writing her new novel. She's been writing it for ten years. She needs to kill off her main character, but can't figure out how to do it. The character's name is Harold Crick.    Stranger Than Fiction doesn't set out to explain how Harold came to be a character in Karen's book, rather it's here to serve as a motivator. Karen Eiffel is Harold's brain cloud or baleful foretold car wreck. Why or how she'll end him matters only to her, for the viewer it's just a question of what he'll do with what time he has left.    This movie is more intelligent than what we usually get from the studios. Nothing in Stranger than Fiction is cookie-cutter or formula driven. It's predictable in short spans, but not in an overall sense. The visuals are playful but the emotional impact is not. Stranger than Fiction is a wonderful cinematic experience.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|I think a lot of people don't like this album nearly as much as his others is because he made the best one already, named \\"Continuum\\". Sadly, it is difficult to beat such an album. Anyways, here's my review of Battle Studies:<br /><br />Interestingly enough, I didn't get into John Mayer until I heard this album. It is more \\"pop\\" than his other albums, which is another reason why it might throw some of his devoted fans off. My favorite albums are Continuum and Battle Studies. \\"Assasin\\", \\"War of My Life\\", \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\", \\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye\\" are some of my favorites. I like the others just as much except for the \\"Crossroads\\" which I know is a cover but I feel it doesn't match the tone of the album. \\"Half of My Heart\\" is okay but I think better songs like \\"Assasin\\" could go on the radio.<br /><br />All in all, this album is a nice listen and I'll enjoy it just as much as Continuum.
0061537969|5.0|I could not put this book down. I am a dog lover but I don't usually read \\"dog\\" books. I was interested in all the main characters in this book and raced to the end to know what happened to them. I laughed out loud at some of Enzo's \\"thoughts\\" and cried at the end. (Mind you, I read while riding the NYC subway where I am usually able to refrain from showing any emotion.) What a beautiful book!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This is by far the best in the series so far. I love all the action from beginning to end and the love story is just amazing I read all the books and seen all them movies and both are wonderful. I also have to give props to amazon, they always get it to me on time
B001EN71CW|5.0|I vaguely remember reading about this series a few years ago.  About how the fan base was trying to save it.  And then it left my mind.  Fast forward to the present, I saw it on the instant watch through Netflix.  I thought to myself \\"if the fans were so rabid about trying to save it, it may be worth the watch.\\"      After watching every episode and crying that it ended to soon, I wanted to kick myself for not watching it when it was on network television.  It is beautiful and dark and funny show.  It evokes so many feelings.  It is just a masterpiece.  I enjoyed it so much, that I asked my mom-in-law for the blu ray set for my birthday.  It is an instant classic for me.
193413712X|3.0|I really feel like I'm missing something here in how this book won a Pulitzer. I thought it was an interesting enough story and the author did a good enough job in developing the two main characters, particularly Howard.  But at various times the story loses it's way (Howard in woods looking for his metaphoric father) and Paul Harding seems to be in love with his own language which to me came off as over wordsy and clumsy at times. I had expected more when I picked it up based on the award.
0140067477|5.0|This book will change your life, if you let the message in. No forcefeeding here like in a lot of philosophy work, just simple pleasureable reading. The beauty of Mr. Hoff's work here is that he explains a somewhat obscure set of ideas with little of the \\"facts\\" we are used to as Americans, using simple characters that we all know and love. Think about it... why do we love Pooh so much? He is clumbsy, doesn't keep good track of time, he eats too much, he doesn't seem very smart,..but...we still love him. This book helps explain why and as I said, if you listen, you will find that you view the world in a whole new way after reading this. You will look for and attach yourself to the \\"Pooh's\\" of the world because they have it right!    If you are looking for a book that will open your eyes to a new way of seeing the work, click on the buy button. If you are familiar with Taoism and want to see it in a more simple form, get it. If you are a synic and wonder why the world doesn't mesh the way you think it should, check this out, it's a cool way of seeing things. Lastly, if you already own this, re-read it. Once you adopt some things from the book, then read it again, a whole new layer of interest appears. Enjoy!    Nice job Mr Hoff.
B00003CWN3|4.0|This movie is extremely difficult to watch, in part because it is based on a true story.  But it is very well made, and it is a must see movie for anyone in the LGBT community or their allies.
B001SRBWN8|5.0|This is the best best best thing I've ever read. It's kind of a religious satire, & your enjoyment of it will be greatly heightened if you have a decent knowledge of the bible- specifically the book of revelations. It's an absolutely excellent read. HIGHLY recommended.
B00170GYB6|1.0|Come on now, this is clearly the worst Schwarzenegger movie of all time. This made his performance in Conan the Barbarian look like he was a classic Shakespearean in comparison. The movie was so bad that our church youth group wanted to leave early - on a mission trip when they would have to sleep on a church floor when they left the theater. I love Arnold over all - minus the last few years as governor when he failed miserably as in this movie. This is so bad that I would not keep it is someone gave me the movie and I would certainly not waste the 99 cents or the time from my life needed to see it.
B004AQR29C|4.0|Okay, it is not Terminator 1 or 2 or the Lord of the Rings, but it was a nice mindless bit of action movie. I was pleasantly (as one can be amidst all the mayhem) surprised because I had read fairly critical reviews. I won't own the movie, but I did not consider it a waste of my life.
B0049VZ2UY|5.0|The Walking Dead raises the bar on zombie related TV Series.  Never have I seen as much graphic content on a TV series except on CSI or Hospital/Doctor show.  FINALLY!!!! A TV station that takes a chance at being graphic while throwing in a pretty good mixed story line of horror, thriller, and comedy.
B002ZG98LO|2.0|No matter how they try to dress it up, this is just a remake of the first Predator.  Why didn't they have more Predators no longer hunting humans on the streets of earth, but a massive full scale war with the army and the twist being they now can take on our form and also they need our women to mate to carry on their race and plan to take over our planet, that would have been more exciting. I tried to enjoy this film but it was so tacky and cliche ridden I thought why the heck did they even bother.  What should have been an all out assault on our senses is just a let down making this the perfect example of just how much hollywood is short changing fans.  Let's hope this is the last Predator sequel, as it looks like leftovers from Outlander and Avatar.  Worth a watch if you must but it's no worthy addition, Predator 2 is still the best of the Predator sequels.
B002ZG999U|1.0|I found this film tasteless and boring with a feeling to why the heck was it ever made, when you see Bruce and big Arnie bow out early, take it as a cue for you to do likewise, even the normally dependable Jason Statham looks bored.  I'm off to rewatch the last Rambo film, that has violently good action, this is just an expendable waste of time.
0316098337|4.0|The author makes a thoroughly unique attempt to bring us into the world of a mother and son imprisoned in a fortified garden shed.  The mother was abducted from a college campus and the son was born out of the repeated sexual assaults that she endured from her captor.  Jack, the child names objects and considers them his friends.  He exists in a room that is probably not much bigger than my son's bedroom.  He is unable to understand or imagine that there is a world outside of this room.  He believes that ants and spiders are real, but that dogs are \\"only on television\\" or not real.  I loved seeing this world through Jack's eyes.  Donogue does a fantastic job of showing us how Jack's mom has created a happy loving environment out of the little she has be given.  She plays games, makes crafts, and does exercise.   Eventually we see just how much Jack depends on mom and loves her.  He is willing to do something that requires bravery and trust most kids don't have at age 5.  I encourage you to try this out this book.  I was not dissapointed!
0451228731|2.0|I found Daemon to be a entertaining read, definitely original and ground-breaking.    but...    Something that really nagged at me and constantly broke my suspension of disbelief: The Daemon is simply too perfect to be believable.     The Daemon's designer in the book, the late Matthew Sobol had a background in Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs). I've played a few.    With MMORPGs -- and with any real world computer program for that matter -- even after beta testing, the games are plagued with glitches, errors, and unanticipated loopholes that clever players can exploit. So real world games see a succession of patches to fix the holes. This is despite running the beta game on a test server with real players prior to official release. There is no replacement for seeing the game live, and played extensively by the full playerbase to expose the ever-present issues that never surfaced during development and trials. Any later additions or developments must also be themselves patched.     This is a fact of life that anybody dealing with computer programs accepts. Programs must be constantly patched and fixed, until months and years down the road, they are near perfect... and then are subsequently replaced by a new program which must itself be patched and fixed.    Contrast this with Sobol's Daemon which is simply perfect on release. No errors. No exploits. No patches.     Yeah, sure.
192076920X|5.0|This book grabs you from the first sentence and doesn't dissapoint all the way to the end. What a great read. I have sold tons of these books recommending this to complete strangers all the time.
B003UYUR10|4.0|This was a great movie.  Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job playing the Prince of Persia in this movie.  I don't really know how else to review a movie other than I liked it.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|but it was written as a YA novel. Not as much depth as there could have been for a story this powerful
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Classic Russell Crowe acting.  He is great at playing these roles.  I have seen him play others and they are good, but not as good as an action role.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Yes, my 3 and 5 year olds love this.  But, so do I.  Not only do I find the theme timeless, and the hero's journey no less powerful than in a \\"live action\\" film, but I relish the planting of these seeds in the minds of my kids.  Much of old Disney fare seems tired in light of our modern (e.g. post-feminist, post-racial) era.  But, the themes in this film, self-sacrifice, self-sufficiency, and remaining true despite loss and peril are well presented.  I remain awed by Pixar's ability to present stories that are both appealing to kids, engaging and humorous to adults, and that convey timeless ethical memes to young viewers.
B0044IJ1S6|5.0|Art (as they say) is subjective and in the case of Tour Of The Universe - Live In Barcelona or even Depeche Mode for that matter you either get the magic or you sadly don't and those who do, and or own this 2 disc set are the lucky ones.    If you were one of the estimated 2.7 million fortunate who managed to catch the boys from Basildon live on this tour as I did from the 13th row in Anaheim you can attest to the fact that Depeche live are more of a revival meeting than a rock concert and what director Russell Thomas has managed to capture in this the Mode's first glorious Blu-ray outing borders on the miraculous.  Unlike Touring the Angel live in Milan which was a seemingly head-spinning attempt to capture the hearts and eyes of A.D.D./MTV addicts everywhere, TOTU is tasteful, thoughtful  and a testament to a director who understands \\"it's about the performance and the music stupid\\" as he approaches the task with the TLC of a man (not unlike long-time Depeche creative genius Anton Corbijn) who clearly knows that the best concert films make you feel like you were there or are able to take you back to the 13th row as this production does brilliantly.    With that said however anyone who knows anything about Depeche Mode's Devotee's knows if you put 10 of them in a room together they'll all find something different to winge about (which may be part of their charm).  Alright so this might not be the earth shaking Devotional, 101, One Night in Paris or as \\"dark\\" as some might like but it's hardly a liability and part of what makes it great.  TOTU showcases a band that even after 30 years continues to surprise us, evolve and mature despite some grumbling by well-meaning fans comfortably stuck somewhere between Black Celebration and Songs of Faith and Devotion.  Perhaps no other moment illustrates Depeche's interpersonal growth more than the fact that Dave (Gahan) goes topless only once in the closing moments of Never Let Me Down Again and returns for the encore in a black tank-top, hey man, as he put it in the bonus features \\"I'm pushing 50\\" so get over it, that's not to say however that he still doesn't have the swagger of a sex crazed snake because he's dripping in charisma (damn him), he's just thrown a sprinkle of modesty into the mix.    Throughout this Olympian  performance it's evident that Depeche, although always cognizant of their fans' needs, is on a never ending journey to also satisfy their own creative. personal and spiritual cravings and in doing so appear relaxed, energized and reveling in the liberation it brings, nowhere is this more evident than in the closing moments of the concert (SPOILER ALERT) where an obvious miscue during Waiting for the Night between Dave and Martin (Gore) becomes a picture perfect moment of how far these two performers and friends have come together personally and professionally.  Kudos to the band for being grown up enough not to fix this perfectly sweet moment in editing.  There's also a spontaneous bit where Dave turns to Martin after a brilliant guitar performance and shoots him a look as if to say \\"Holy s#@t man, that was amazing!\\" Priceless.  Dave loves his mate Mart and unabashedly basks in the wondrous gifts of Martin L. Gore, it's one of the reasons this team still works and why we love 'em.    The 21 song set includes the usual Mode barn-burning suspects and introspective masterpieces as well as 5 tracks from Sounds of the Universe which is fair considering they were on the road promoting their new record, they're hardly clunkers and Wrong will certainly find a permanent place in future set lists.    One minor gripe is that they couldn't find some way to simply included the 5 bonus live tracks, including the soaring One Caress or new comer Miles Away/The Truth Is, with it's killer mind grinding front and center guitar riff into the program as it's a bit of a drag to watch these great performances one at a time and not in sequence, in my book they would have only enhanced the overall experience.      The 5.1 sound is crystal clear and the mix exceptional befitting the outstanding vocal and instrumental performances.  The HD visuals are razor sharp.  The creative but tasteful camera work is brilliant and at times breathtaking although occasionally straining to see the band through a sea of cell phones and cameras brought back nightmarish flashbacks from my Mode  encounter at the Honda Center.  It's nice the band gives the fans that sort of photo/video freedom but when you drop that kind of coin on a decent seat the last thing you want to do is watch the show through cell phone screens, but I digress.    The extra's on Disc 2 are hardly filler as you're treated to a very candid and extremely well produced \\"making of\\".  What is immediately evident in this compelling glimpse behind the TOTU scenes is the bands lack of pretense, they have clearly grown up and the rose colored glasses have been packed away.  And although each member of the band and management team address the personal and health crisis' that befell the unit they're introspective and honest without self-aggrandizement and telling \\"too much\\".  Bonus material also includes two great rehearsal tracks Walking in My Shoes and Wrong, the production videos from the tour as well as the 4 promotional clips for the Sounds of the Universe singles Wrong, Peace, Fragile Tension and the ill advised and stomach turning video for Hole to Feed, which in my humble estimation is the absolute low point in the bands otherwise unrivaled visual repertoire, so if you have a hair-trigger gag reflex you've been warned!    What is truly remarkable about TOTU is that is was wildly successful without a half-dozen singles on the charts, publicity generating scandals or hype.  Tour of the Universe is a testament to Depeche Mode's artistic depth, remarkable talent, dedication, tenacity and honesty; their ever-suffering but eternally loyal fans and the unseen forces that must certainly play a significant roll in shaping and expanding the Depeche Mode Universe.
B000B8QG22|5.0|Good Morning, Vietnam stars Robin Williams playing the character of a radio announcer/comedian who makes the trip to Vietnam and gives the soldiers the morning news by way of humor, honesty and quick-witted cleverness.    However, the entire movie is not *quite* a comedy film.  Every so often, you will be probably be surprised by a few really accurate portrayals showing what it really was like living in Vietnam during the war involving the way the Vietnamese were living.    However the storyline mostly centers around Robin Williams' character getting to know the Vietnamese and communicating with them by walking around town and meeting them.  He even becomes a temporary teacher at one point, teaching the Vietnamese the English language and entertaining them in a goofy manner.    Robin immediately takes an interest in this one Vietnamese woman who initially doesn't give a darn about him at all, but eventually things change later on.    Another storyline element involves the brother of the girl he has an interest in.  He plays a crucial (and surprising) part in the storyline later on and gives one heck of a great speech at the end of the film.    I'm really shocked at a few of those accurate surprises I mention above.  One scene in particular shows an explosion that totally caught me by surprise because of the timing, and other scenes show Vietnamese teens being forced to stand up against a wall and immediately be shot.  These are really shocking scenes to me.      Luckily the really violent and brutally honest portrayal of Vietnam back in the early 70's only takes up a very small portion of the actual storyline.  The movie mostly focuses on Robin Williams' role as the comedian.    Now those of you who've seen Robin Williams stand-up comedy routine, don't worry- he's not nearly as crude in this film as he is during those comedy acts on stage.  I'd say 80% of the jokes in Good Morning, Vietnam are clean and completely appropriate for the entire viewing audience.  That *other* 20% isn't really that bad either.  To sum it up- the film mostly shows Robin Williams just being his typically goofy self.    A movie I highly recommend for the drama and comedy elements, however if you dislike Robin Williams style of humor, it's probably best to steer clear of this one.
B004498KPU|3.0|When it comes to music videos one man who had a strong influence on them was Michael Jackson. There were considered promotional tools (and that's kind of what they are) but Michael changed the way the world looked at them and HIS videos are some of the most memorable ones. Who can forget a young MJ in the red jacket he wore for \\"Thriller\\"? Possibly the most iconic music video there is. Or how about Michael dancing along criminals in \\"Smooth Criminal\\"? And that lean? How about that Black or White video when... I think you get it by now; Michael's influence was not only felt on music itself but also on music videos. It's hard not to think of Michael without remembering one his classic short film.It's great that Michel Jackson's Vision, a DVD collection containing each music video (or short films as Michael liked to call them) made by the king of pop was released. The packaging itself is very nice (I love the 60+ pages booklet and the gold box looks very good) and the idea of having all of Michael's music videos in one place for the fans who want to own them on DVD (some are just fine with YouTube and don't feel the need to pay for this release) is a no-brainer.<br /><br />Visions sounds like a great release and something that fans would be interested in owning, however, the video format is a big issue. Watching them, many of the videos have a black box surrounding them ruins the experience a little I have to say. I wish Sony would have done something about this because it ruins it for many fans and is unfair to them. I won't say more because other reviewers have done so here and gave good descriptions. I also don't quite understand why Visions is not available on Blue-Ray, to me it's not a big deal but I know there are plenty of fans who would have preferred/wanted this on BR (it's Sony who releases this but it's not available on BR?).<br /><br />One of the most unfortunate thing is that the version of Ghost here is the 5 minutes edit and not the full version; it would have been nice to have it here in its entirety and it would've made sense since it's hard to get hold of (there will probably be a future release) and there was enough space. It would also have been best if the original \\"Blood On The Dance Floor\\" was included instead of the mediocre remix. On the other hand it's certainly nice to have the bonus disc with the prison edit of \\"They Don't Care About Us\\", the unreleased videos for \\"One More Chance\\", \\"Say Say Say\\" with Paul McCartney and more along some classic video with Michael's brothers (then known as \\"The Jacksons\\"). Getting unreleased content is always a bonus and it's the case here as well, I think it's good to finally have some of this stuff released, yes there was room for more but this is strictly a collection of MJ's videos. Some of the videos look better than ever whereas others look as if you're watching as VHS tape, for instance \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\". Like other fans, I would have expected better quality from a DVD release but I'm glad to have them (and the video quality is still better than YouTube for me).<br /><br />While it's great to have all of MJ's videos in one place the format issue is simply too big to be ignored : 3/5 stars.e to have it here in its entirety and it would've made sense since it's hard to get hold of (there will probably be a future release) and there was enough space.

It has a similar beauty to such books as Alice Sebold's Lovely Bones and Peter Carey's His Illegal Self (both books I highly recommend) in which the child-as-victim viewpoint in boldly triumphant and redemptive and calls upon the reader to think about the things in life that are most important - the sustaining power of love, of family (though with beautifully broad definitions of this), the beauty of simplicity and quiet, etc.  I think the book also comments on -- and this applies to the other two books too -- the many ways our modern life is its own dystopia. Really in this book, you'll ask, which is the greater craziness? The innocent observations of Jack point all too clearly to numerous ironies which together are a clear referendum on a 21st century materialistic world.    And the book is just so hauntingly beautiful it just stays and sits with you. Today even going to work I thought to myself, \\"my, the world is very loud indeed\\" - an observation Jack makes himself on several occasions.    My only regret about this book - so I say this to those who have NOT had the pleasure yet of reading Room - try to go slowly and savor every moment because every single sentence is intentional and stunning.  However, this will be a challenge because it is a page-turner - but I wish I could have read it for months on end....    Enjoy this book -- these works of art rarely come along. Your heart will be filled.

B00428ZRFY|5.0|Rihanna never disappoints me when it comes to her music and I have been a fan since 2005. This album has no fillers, every song has the potential to be a hit. In fact the 2 single that she has released so far have been just that. HITS. In fact Only Girl (In the world) has been #1 in the world for the past 4 weeks. It also went #1 on the Billboard charts and dance pop chart. The same can be said for What's My Name? it went #1 on the Bb charts also. Please purchase it. I promise you will not be disappointed. She covers all genres of music and there is something for everyone unless you are fastidious. Buy It!!!!
B000S95KTY|2.0|This movie is a fine example of how editing should not be done,  around litterly half of the movie could have been edited out and you would have been left with something better in the end.  The directors edition instead of making an effort to cut scenes that really just slow things down they decided to make the movie even LONGER.  The movie does not have the charm or interest of the TV series that came before it.  It starts off slow, its slow in the middle, they felt that the long sweeping shots of things in space would make people excited but it only slow things down.  For example for several minutes of the film we see the crew just staring at the inside of V*Ger which is not a whole lot to see other then some flashy effects this scene could have been cut down and just shown the jist of it.    Every Star Trek movie after this one does capture the feel of the series it represents and is fun to watch but this movie is really only for those who are die hard trek fans.  though it does not hurt to watch it at least once for Trek Fans but its just in my opinion the worst Star Trek movie ever made its basically two hours of flying through space gawking over V*Ger and trying to communicate with it and stop it from blowing up things.  Yeah really exciting.     They could have taken any one of the episodes of the 3 years of the original series and expanded it into a movie and it would have been better then this.    I would recommend any of the 10 movies that came after this one.  Only worth if if you buy it in a set.
0307454541|4.0|Absolutely brilliant and completely captivating writing.  Larsson was a brilliant writer who created a genius plot.  Unlike most mysteries on the market, this book truly had me guessing until the very last page.  I ended up staying up until 3:00 a.m. to finish the book, only to find out that my hunches of who did it were completely wrong, of course!<br /><br />At times I really liked this book a lot but at times the violence towards women totally creeped me out.  I think that was the point, though?<br /><br />What I appreciated most about Larsson's writing was the detailed plot and characters.  In a typical modern novel an authur might write something to the effect of \\"She had an anger problem.\\"  Not so with Larsson.  In Girl with a Dragon Tattoo, if Larsson wanted the reader to know about an anger problem, he would provide several pages of a backstory which would leave no doubt in the reader's mind as to why she had an anger problem.  Truly, great novel writing at its best.
B0009MAO46|5.0|Haven't seen the first TOY STORY in years. It gets even better with time. It also was the inspiration for me to start writing for animation. I've fallen in love with the genre.  Thanks for helping find my passion, Pixar!
0596805888|5.0|I take this book along to my organic chemistry class, much of the material actually corresponds to what we are learning.  It's an awesome book.  If you are technically minded and like cooking, you'll likely enjoy this book.  Personally, when I cook, I like to read 15 recipes and then make my own dish.  This book is great for both freehand cooks and recipe followers.  Highly recommended!

B0044E9LW6|5.0|What a great thing to have so soon after Ronniie's death, some live stuff from the 1980's!  Dio was one of the first bands I had ever gotten into.  \\"Holy Diver\\" was like the 3rd album I had bought when I first started listening to music.  Hence, the early Dio years holds a special spot for me.  Dio has a lot of great songs on the first 4 albums and we have here, in this 2 CD set, 2 discs full of Dio.  One show from 1983 and the other from 1987.  Dio is awesome live and the rest of the band form a tight unit around the grand master of mysticism.  Heaven And Hell, Black Sabbath, Rainbow, and Elf are very cool.  For me, I thought Dio's solo stuff was really great and I think it is being overlooked at the moment.  Hopefully it will change with this new release.  He is the king of rock and roll!
014241543X|5.0|I am loving this book!  I recently lost my father, I sat in his room with him watching him die.  This book really brought back that day but not in a bad way!  I am grateful for this book!
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|I loved it. I thought the music was wonderful, the characters were wonderfully illustrated and voiced, the film moved at a good pace. It was great ensemble cast. Even though the story was focused on Tiana, the film really did a good job of engaging and making me care about the supporting characters.    But let's get to the controversies:    1. Black prince: At first, I was a bit put off by the fact that Tiana didn't marry a black prince, but I quickly got over it. It would have been nice, but it took decades to get a Black Disney princess so I couldn't complain too much.    2. Is it too dark for children/voodoo: I guess I look at it this way, Disney has always had questionable content in their films. As a child I never noticed it, but as an adult I see it more. For example: as a child Ursula was just an octopus, but as an adult I took more notice of the fact that she was an evil witch. Disney has always had witchcraft in their films, so if you don't want your kids seeing the Princess & the Frog because of voodoo references, then you probably should take issue with Sleeping Beauty, Snow White & the Seven Dwarves, The Little Mermaid, The Sword & the Stone, etc because it all deals heavily with witchcraft.    Bottom line: I loved it. And I think that it is a child-friendly movie. But at the end of the day, parents need to know what their child can & cannot handle. In the end, parents need to decide what is acceptable and unacceptable for their child. But I feel like the movie was fine. All the children that I know who have seen it loved it; especially, the little girls.

B002ZG999U|1.0|Wow, what a horrible movie..........yeah I liked most of the actors in this movie but together they are horrible.  I enjoyed all of these actors growing up but something happened when they put all of them in the same movie.  I do not know how better else to describe this movie...........when it ended I just blinked and thought of what else I could have been doing.
B004BSEKH6|2.0|I write this review after watching Nicki's MTV Documentary just now and having purchased her album.    The long and short of it is this; Nicki is a EXTREMELY bright, talented young lady. She is so very aware of her surroundings and the industry she finds herself now DEEPLY meshed in. She is in touch with music and its heart, which includes an awareness of how beats, lyrics, and sound all fuse together to create an experience for the listener. You can hear from a lot of her cameos in other performer's songs that she is indeed a very quick, witty MC that can hold her own. She comes from humble beginnings, and she very much knows who she is. She wants to be the Lady Gaga of hip-hop essentially, fusing a bit of `glam-rock' element in while drastically altering the stereotypical perception of what makes a good hip-hop artist. Few others would dare attempt such, especially in a culture and industry where women are often not only overlooked, but flat out shunned, regardless of their talents.    All that being said, this album is disappointing. It's not just because the album itself has very little flow to it; that is, there is no \\"picture\\" painted by this album, but more like a collage of random ideas and sounds arranged in fairly random order. It's not just because a lot of the songs effectively deeply underplay her voice range and talent with switching vocal ranges, accents, and melodies very quickly. It's a combine affect of the lack of real lyrical depth in tandem with all the auto-tune effects, along with all the aforementioned issues, that creates a overall poor listening experience and a poor first release.     Listening to this album, I am strangely reminded of that show Cake Boss and the stuff they churn out; while it is certainly an amazing piece of architecture which was produced by nothing less than the most genius within the industry..can you really eat and digest it? Does it even taste good? Does anyone really want to try eating it?  One has to wonder in listen to this album where is Nicki's foundation? As another review pointed out, it's like she skipped over her 'hardcore' era, choosing instead to go straight for the 'look at me now' segment of her career. That may be the heart of the problem with this album...it's like it's out of place, in general; like a soundtrack to a gimmick Barbie Doll, rather than an introspective look into a bright, budding artist. Foundation is so critical in this industry, because without it, there is nothing to 'prove' you really should exist within it, thus making it all the more likely you will crash rather hard, rather fast.    It's like something got lost along the way here...as if an elaborate Wonderland of sound was compiled in each song, but when you look back, the story has no beginning, middle, or end...only a spiral of nebulousness. Some of the songs do stand out as really attempting to put the listener better 'in touch' with Nicki's more personal side, like Dear Old Nicki and Moment 4 Life. But in the end, it gets lost in the mad shuffle and competing sound that is all the auto-tuning, sound effects (often out of place), and over-chorusing, and drown out the depth of the art that is threaded through this album. It's like taking Picasso and covering it with a bunch of pink bows and little bunny rabbit stickers...something potentially Earth-shattering just became a joke.....a concoction for mad consumerism.    I try to keep in mind that she is still a new artist, despite how bright she is, which in itself comes with a learning curve. And as much as I like Lil Wayne and respect how intelligent and witty he is as well, I can't say I really think he would be the best example for an up-and-coming like Nicki to roll with; all Wayne's protégés tend to try to imitate Wayne more and more over time and lose a large chunk of their individuality...call this 'The Wayne effect', when ego gets so large, it encompasses everyone around you, not just yourself, costing you the ability to take criticism and grow from it.    I'm not giving up on Nicki because of this album because I think if you look back on many of the most talented and remembered artists throughout time, many of their first full releases were not their greatest. She became the first artist in history to have 7 different songs on the Billboard 100, all before even having a full album released. That is no easy task, and for that alone she deserves a lot of respect. She has a lot of growing to do before she can really better define herself outside the realm of guest appearances and hype. She's certainly got the smarts and the natural talent.    It is my true hope that Nicki will distance herself overtime from the over-produced, exaggerated hyped side of this industry and return to what her mixtapes display; a large potential for reshaping the landscape for female rap artists...but only if she can push away from the nonsense the industry itself is pushing her to be (including her handlers). She will have to not cave so much to the pressure of her record company and forge her own path. With time and experience, this will become easier. Let's hope she can last long enough in the industry to see that. That road however won't be so easy.
0765326353|5.0|I have been a reader of fantasy for some 35 years and have read or sampled most of the major authors in the genre. I had previously sampled works by Brandon Sanderson, including Elantris, the Mistborn trilogy, and Warbreaker, and considered them good, but not great. I was not expecting much from the [[ASIN:0765326353 The Way of Kings (The Stormlight Archive)]]. I was, to abuse a metaphor, blown away.    The principal reason I loved Tolkein, and still do, is not principally because of the magnificence of his worldbuilding, his love of fine language, or storytelling gifts, althogh these are all part of it.  It is because there was a clear conflict between loyalty, peace, honor, and mercy on the one hand, and lies, cruelty, crudity, and hatred on the other: and the good guys won. Most of his successors and imitators, while they excel in other ways, fall short of the standard he set here.    The world of Roshar with its semi-magical highstorms is distinctive, unique, and crafted in great and loving detail, from the grass which withdraws into the ground, to the crustacean-derived beasts of burden and pets, to the chasmfiends with their four-voiced sreams. The magical spren which accompany such things as wind, fire, rain, life, death, decay, fear, pain, logic, and music are also distinctive.     Sanderson's language is not particularly erudite and doesn't require a dictionary to read. The story moves along without lengthy detours for description or philosophical soliloquy. The characters are distinctive and memorable, and they learn, grow, and develop over the course of the story. Although the shift from one to another at the resolution of every subplot can be a little distracting, the stories of the main characters all weave together and the cast is not unmanageably large. Several minor characters do not appear to be particularly relevant in this one, but can be expected to reappear in later books in the series.     But it is the strong moral sense that Sanderson's workembodies that attracts me most.  The heroes are good without being perfect. The villains are bad without being demonic. While they may have magically enhanced powers, their motivations are human and understandable. The choices that even the good characters make are not always clear, simple, easy, or right.     Rather than endlessly moralizing about honor, Sanderson shows it in such things as the horrified expression on the face of a spirit of oaths, promises, and nobility who looks on a premeditated act of treachery. He has created a fallen world dominated by a hidden evil, but one where a heartfelt whispered vow may bring power that echoes like ten crashes of thunder on the mountains. I want more.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|This is such a great follow-up to Toy Story 2.  It provides closure with one owner and a beginning with another.    I love the fact that it portrays Andy in light of how I wish kids could be - a kid at heart.  It makes me sad to see kids try to grow up so fast and that they think they are too old for toys.      Overall a GREAT family movie!
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis Presley along with Sam Cooke and Andy Williams are the three most superb popular vocalists of my lifetime. Elvis 30 #1 Hits is the very best opportunity now available for either the new or the long-term fan of Elvis Presley to hear Elvis sing as he truly sounded in the studio when he first recorded these songs! Since each of these songs have been remastered, even the die-hard fan of Elvis, like myself, who has heard and loved each of these songs many times before, will hear Elvis sing more clearly and more fully than ever before! Hearing Elvis so beautifully, superbly, clearly, and fully sing like this, along with his outstanding accompanying instrumentation and vocalists, on 30 of Elvis' most popular songs is an extremely wonderful listening experience! Elvis 30 #1 Hits is a most fittting tribute to the truly remarkable musical achievements of Elvis Presley. No other recording artist or band, including the Beatles, can rightfully compare to the fabulous, extensive, and enduring musical legacy of Elvis Presley! Yet an Elvis Presley who was consistently engaged in recording outstanding rhythm and blues music, free of his crippling addiction to prescription drugs, and managed by someone who was primarily focused upon making great music, not solely focused upon making easy money, would have produced a musical legacy that was at least twice as prolific and at least twice as remarkable as the formidable lasting legacy that Elvis actually did create. In the end, Elvis Presley did not highly enough appreciate his own life or his unmatched musical talent. Thus there is an element of sadness about Elvis' short life, because it could have been much more musically and socially productive. There may never again be another voice that is so completely right for rock music, rhythm and blues music, and slower romantic ballads. I most strongly recommend Elvis 30 #1 Hits to each and every person who admires musical achievement and who enjoys popular music. Elvis 30 #1 Hits epitomizes the MUST BUY CD. Upon first listening, Elvis 30 #1 Hits immediately became one of my most treasured compact discs. This cd will be played time after time, and will always continue to bring me, and every other Elvis fan, outstanding listening pleasure.     John
B000NQRR1Q|4.0|The Ninth Gate really surprised me. Certainly, its no secret that Polanski is a talented director, but I never imagined anyone could make a half-way decent movie on the subject of satanism. Movies about the occult invariably degenerate into a scene where a bunch of weirdos sit around and chant gibberish. Then if it is really bad, a monster or something will actually appear, and its all down hill from there. If you dont believe me, check out Ghoulies.    What really impressed me about the Ninth Gate was something that many people did not care for: the slow pace of the story. Too many movies staring high profile actors are in such a rush to get to the ending, and the ending more often that not is maddeningly predictable. Also, Johnnie Depp's performance as a rare book dealer was quite solid. In spite of the phoney tufts of grey hair, he didn't really look  like someone in his 40s. But something about his mannerisms and the cadence in his voice actually made him seem older. The other stand out performance was Frank Langellia, who was amazingly good as a wealthy satanist obsessed with collecting occult manuscripts. Emmanuelle Seigner (Polanski's wife) played the mystery girl, Depp's sidekick who occaisionally exhibited superhuman powers. I think the movie would have been better without this character - or at least without any characters having superhuman abilities. Seigner is a fine actress, but this is the sort of role that noone could pull off.     Incidentally, this movie is based on a novel called \\"The Dumas Club\\". Although Polanski definitely used this book as a starting point, he discarded many characters and scenes and then inserted his own. Even getting away from a strict comparison of character/scene inventories, the tone of the movie was much creepier and mysterious than the book. Almost all references to Dumas and literature were stripped away, while occult elements of the storyline were emphasized. Also, the movie leaves several key questions unanswered, forcing the audience fill in the blanks. For instance, who (in the movie) was responsible for attempting to destroy copies of the Ninth Gate? Or just as importantly, what motivated them to do this in the first place? Unlike many contemporary directors, Polanski appreciates the importance of creating a little mystery for his audience.
B0042AEOG0|1.0|Her first Christmas album has become one of our holiday favorites and it gets played every year.  This effort is a huge disappointment.  What's up with the song \\"Oh Santa\\" - there's absolutely nothing festive about it - yuk.  Instead, spend the $10 on a gift for someone you love or donate it to charity.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Unless you want to listen to someone who is surprised by absolutely everything, DO NOT GET THE OPRAH narrated version of Life.  I was thrilled to find this version, narrated by David Attenborough, who I learned about animals from many specials growing up.  He just seems more natural to me and more of an authority whereas the Oprah version, which costs more by the way, seemed to me the \\"dumbed down\\" version -- no offense intended to Oprah fans.<br /><br />The photography and imagery of this set is truly a sight to behold, absolutely amazing, breathtaking views.  In Challenges of Life on the first disc, we learn how many species have intelligently evolved their hunting techniques, from the cheetahs -- usually lone hunters, these three brothers found strength in numbers by hunting together, they can take down larger prey -- to the bottle-nosed dolphins off the Florida coast who have developed the mud-ring technique, all are incredibly filmed.<br /><br />The set also includes behind the scenes footage.  Throughout the series, you explore all types of animal species from amphibians and reptiles, to birds, mammals, and fish.  Witness the arctic tundra as a lone seal plays cat and mouse with the ravenous orca.  It is eat or be eaten in the circle of Life, and I find myself rooting for both predator and prey.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, I cannot say enough about the photography.  Suitable for most ages, may want to warn some younger viewers as there is a particularly gruesome scene between a sea lion and a great white shark in which the sea lion loses, but most scenes are not so bloody.<br /><br />Educational and exciting, a comedy, drama, action, and even romance all wrapped in one great package.  Nature is so amazing, you just can't make this stuff up.
B003VIW8DK|5.0|Other reviewers have already hit most of the high points of this gorgeous album already... but needless to say that \\"Olympia\\" brings back much of the lush glam rock and genuine depth that die-hard fans expect from Bryan Ferry and his long time collaborators. What a treat.<br /><br />The influences of Brian Eno (as others have said) hypnotically percolate and permeate, and OLYMPIA will easily rank as my favorite album since \\"Boys and Girls,\\" \\"Frantic\\" and even the classic Avalon.<br /><br />Olympia succeeds on so many levels - A massively well produced album that should comfortably stand the test of time.<br /><br />Nobody exudes coolness like Bryan Ferry.
0805047905|5.0|This has to be my 9 month old's favorite book.  He'll sit there as we read it over and over again... and then he wants us to read it some more!  It's too funny!  Great way for them to get familiar with different colors and animals early on!  Highly recommended
B003WO4UIE|3.0|Long story short: If you're a big fan (like me), you have all these songs already which makes this release pointless.  If you're a casual fan looking for the hits, just spend the extra few dollars and buy Anthology which will give you 3x as many songs and covers his entire career (up until 2007 anyways).
142311339X|5.0|The incredible tales of mythology in modern times continues as Rick Riordan's \\"The Lost Hero\\" has recently become available.    In the Percy Jackson series the whole series focused on a prophecy. This prophecy promised to destroy the world without the help of Percy Jackson.  Now in the Hero's of Olympus series instead of one hero, we need seven.      The book starts out with the main character, Jason, waking up on a bus and having no idea where he is or even who he is.  Two of his friends, ones he is sure he has never met try to figure out just what happened.  But in true Riordan spirit they are soon attacked and the three of them discover that they're not just ordinary kids.    They arrive in Camp Half blood.  Unlike Percy, the three children take the news of gods rather well.  Especially Jason.  The funny thing is, is he prefers to call the gods by their Roman names.  Almost as if he is Roman.    All three children are claimed soon after their arrival and it is evident that they are three of the seven from the dreaded prophecy.  As they are at camp strange things happen.  They all have dreams of Hera, or Juno as Jason calls her.  She is trapped.  These dreams are also the first time in a month that the gods have communicated with the demigods.  Annabeth receives a dream from Hera as well.  While the others are confused, Annabeth hopes it will help her find her boyfriend.  That's right folks, Percy Jackson has gone missing.  It's almost been a month.      While at camp, Jason, Piper and Leo, the new recruits, receive a prophecy from Rachel.  For Piper and Leo this means their first quest.  But Jason is sure this isn't his first quest.     The enemy is greater than the last, the dreaded Kronos.  In fact it is a rather unlikely enemy.  And this is only the beginning.  The three of them will set off to try to destroy the king of the giants, the abductor of Hera.      They all have insecurities, which makes them all the more likely, ironically.  There's Piper daughterof the one Goddess she wishes she weren't.  What can she do, if she doesn't even feel comfortable with who her parent is?  Then there's Leo.  Who would want him around?  Nobody ever has before.  He may even be the reason his mother is dead.  And of course there's Jason.  Who was he?  Was he even really a hero.    This is a brilliant beginning to what is guaranteed to be an amazing series.  Riordan is at his finest.  This is a great adventure, one you will not want to miss.
030745455X|1.0|I was in the first row of a commuter flight from Phoenix to Tuscon when the pilot announced we were 14th in line for take off.  I was strapped in; my bag was up above and all I had out was this book.  I was on page 125 and bored already.  Not being able to stand another word, I found a way to pass the time.  I began ripping the book into quarters, 20 pages at a time.  When I was finished I had a stack of over 2000 pages and the stares of a few concerned passengers.<br /><br />If you make the mistake of buying this tripe, try tearing it up.

B003UESJGK|5.0|In the midst of all the holiday hubbub, I grabbed some time to see \\"Love and Other Drugs,\\" an intriguing exploration of love in contemporary times (the late 1990s, actually).<br /><br />Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal shine in this drama about discovering love in unexpected places and with unexpected partners.<br /><br />Jake plays a young man (Jamie) who grew up in with the expectation ( by his parents) that he would go to medical school; instead, he falls into a career as a pharmaceutical salesman.  His goal is to achieve top kudos in this field, which means beating out the competition.  It is a time of Prozac vs. Zoloft, and the release of Viagra.<br /><br />When Jamie  meets Maggie (Anne Hathaway), he expects to have a brief fling.  Instead, he discovers a deeper connection that defies everything he believes to be true about himself.  Because Maggie is suffering from Stage I Parkinson's Disease.<br /><br />I was surprised at how captivating this film was, with no boring moments at all.  While the end may have been somewhat predictable, it was still satisfyingly poignant.<br /><br />A wonderful little snippet of time during the holiday season, filled with sad and joyful feelings...which is why I would give this one five stars.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|When I had heard this movie was coming out I didn't really know that much about Scott Pilgrim.  I saw the trailers and was really skeptical about how this movie would be.  The trailers alone do not do this movie justice at all.  This was the best summer movie that I saw.  It has action, video game sounds and references, awesome fights, and a great story.  Everyone who is in this movie is cast perfectly and there wasn't one moment that I didn't enjoy.<br /><br />The story is about the title character Scott Pilgrim who falls in love with Ramona Flowers.  To date her though he must defeat her seven evil exes.  That doesn't sound like much of a story, but when you add all of the humor and special effects in it turns out to be a lot of fun.<br /><br />I bought the Blu-Ray the day it came out and it has a ton of special features on the making of the film.  The special features make you appreciate how much work went into this movie.  This is one of those films that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it.  Truly a classic graphic novel movie in my opinion.  After watching the film I bought all of the books here on Amazon and was amazed how true they stayed to the graphic novel.  There is however, a lot that was cut out, but all of the jokes come straight from the graphic novel's dialog.
B00004WPFX|5.0|Homework is by far the roughest sounding daft punk album, with the exception of alive 1997, in its entirety comparing the works of discovery and homework seem easy, and many make the assumption that homework is a \\"worse\\" album because it is not as polished as discovery. This however is not true. Homework was daft punks beginning, its  the big bang, its \\"the chronic\\", its the epicenter. What this album has over \\"discovery\\" is flavor, its not for the faint of heart, it has rough, violent sounds. Its raw and uninviting sometimes, but it takes you into a world that transports you to a different realm of thinking. The first time I listened to homework I hated it, slowly however it grows on you the like the sound of waves in the song \\"fresh\\" it means something to everyone and connects the listeners in someway. That's really were homework prevails, it connects people, to something, someone - a memory, a time spent with others, good feelings - bad. Its that homework is so raw and uninviting that it opens emotions in people its harsh, and its difficult to first connect with but in the end it gives the listener and the music purveyor - a connection to a different world and that high of listening to your favorite album over and over again.     Homework, not some type of award winning album, however its much deeper and warmer than anything else you can buy on the shelf.     My favorite songs, \\"Fresh, Rollin, Fidelity, Rock n Roll\\". Listen to the album from start to finish, headphones on, and sit back relax and enjoy the journey.     Im a DJ, I've been listening to DP since I was 11, still nodding my head everyday.
B003XKAZKO|5.0|Don't think about getting this wonderful album, JUST GET IT. There's nothing to think about, IT WAS GREAT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT, and it's EVEN GREATER NOW that it's remastered and including beautiful tracks like LIFEGUARD ON DUTY, and more. The whole lil package is gorgeous and will have you staring at it for hours. If you're not a DIE HARD fan of Steven Patrick, then this is a FANTASTIC album to start or continue with. You won't regret it. Thank you, Amazon!
B0019KC4U4|4.0|This is a review of the 2007 issue of this album. It has a bonus dvd on it, but I haven't checked that out yet. The cd of the album runs to 51:17 minutes long. Musically, this is a concept album because it seems to be about something at times. I'm just not sure what, exactly. Why? Well, the lyrics aren't really engaging...the images wash over me without engaging. On first listen I gave this 72.5/100. On second listen I gave it \\"77.5/100?\\". So, maybe you could split the difference/doubt and call it 75/100?  The best tracks:  Horizons - 1:41 long. Initially I gave this a \\".\\" but bumped up my estimation of it to a small tick \\"/\\"...ranking songs out of 10 doesn't really work for me...a dot signifies \\"not bad\\"...a good thing. Anyway, this is a nice acoustic guitar instrumental...notes are picked...prettily.  Can-utility and the coastliners - 5:44. Pleasant string instruments (acoustic guitar?), woodwind type instrument, bass synthesiser at times, organ, bells, bass (can't make out the adjective I use for this in my notes...\\"reedy\\"?  Oh...I think it says \\"speedy\\"). Drumming is heavy at times.  Supper's ready - 23:05. No, the time length is not a misprint! A track of alternating moods. Has some pretty acoustic guitar notes. Other times there is punishing percussion....good, hard drumming (e.g. 6:33-8:03). Some passages have keyboard, others have got the electric guitar at times (the latter has a solo at one point). Gabriel's vocals have a 'torn' quality to them, if that makes sense. Multi-vocals are utilised at times (at the start there is, I'm guessing, overdubbed acoustic guitar and vocals). There may be an instrument like a tuba played at one point. Have to say that I find the woodwind melody pretty at times (e.g. 14:19-15:34). There are children singing for a bit in this song. The lyrical expression is cleverly written at times. Song has got some biblical references to it, which goes towards it concept, I presume...e.g. \\"666\\" gets a mention in the song. Hmm...I wasunder the impression that LPs could only hold 22.5 minutes of music per side...obviously this song must have taken one entire side of an LP!  A better track (on second listen):  Time table - \\">[.]\\"  4:46 long. Piano, bass, drums.  String notes are very light at times and \\"plinky\\" at other times. Lyrical form is more narrative at the start and therefore more engaging than usual for Genesis. Lyrics are reflective...on humanity, perhaps (I dunno). Song has a musical theatre vibe to it. Also has a Billy Joel vibe to it at times. Sort of pretty at times.   The rest:  Watcher of the skies - 7:23.  Organ and/or keyboard, bass, drums. Proggy, with some heavy metal rhythms to it at times (the bass and drums sound jazzy at other times). The drumming is beefy at times, which perhaps gave rise to my 'heavy metal' observation. Generally a mid-tempo track. Also has a sort of triumphal march vibe to it at times. Sort of grand lyrical themes vibe to the song as well.   Get 'em out by Friday - 8:35.  Organ, bass, drums, woodwind at times. Has a proggy and jazzy vibe to it (especially for the bass?). Nice guitar bits...I'm assuming that the stringed instrument is in fact a guitar. Lyrics have 'student theatre' vibe to them. Maybe they are sci-fi related? In any case, the lyrics seem important...but maybe they're not. Hard to tell just via listening.   Recommendations:  Genesis - From Genesis to Revelation. 9/10. Bee Gees influenced album. Their best that I've heard (heard everything up to \\"Foxtrot\\").  King Crimson - In the court of the Crimson King. 9/10. Their debut album and best to at least \\"Lizard\\".  King Crimson - Lizard. 82.5/100. Maybe has some similarities to \\"Foxtrot\\"...obscure lyrics for a start and a track which must have taken an entire side of an LP!  Pink Floyd - More (soundtrack). 4/5. Good mix of their heaviest rock songs and more experimental tracks.

B002LLE3PY|4.0|This is a review of the release with the bonus dvd disc. Haven't checked that out. The cd portion of this release runs to 59:07 minutes and has three bonus tracks...two of which are alternative takes of the original album songs. Anyway, the music is pleasant and melodic, with a little rock thrown in and a lot of jazz. Sound quality is excellent. Lyrics are punchy but opaque at times...in other words they're poetic, but don't really work on me as a mode of story-telling...which is to say I find that the lyrics just wash over me and don't engage me. Drumming is busy.<br /><br />The best tracks (on second listen):<br /><br />Lady of the dancing water - \\">/\\" (i.e. a small tick)  Pleasant track...has the flute, or something of the sort. Acoustic guitar plays notes. Organ, a trumpet (or some brass instrument) and soothing vocals).<br /><br />Cirkus - \\">[.]\\"  Delicate (tightly strung?) piano. Spanish sounding acoustic guitar note picking. Organ, saxophone, brass, solid drumming at times, bass. Pleasant. Lyrics seem a bit of nonsense to me at times...i.e. obscure and silly. The pretty parts (of the guitar, I assume...my notes are not totally clear here) alternate with eerie keyboard parts.<br /><br />The rest (in chronological order):<br /><br />Indoor games - dinky sounding organ at the start. Sax? Acoustic guitar, bass, electric guitar. The end has a laugh like that in \\"Revenge of the nerds\\", I think...dorky. Strumming on the acoustic guitar is nice, at times...sort of Crosby, Stills and Nash territory, perhaps...whoever did the song \\"Love the one you're with\\" in any case.<br /><br />Hapy family - jazz style track, especially for the piano notes. Weird synth sound, piano, distorted/choppy vocal sounds at start (intentional). Flute?<br /><br />Lizard - comes in at a whopping 23:35 minutes long! This song must have taken an entire side of the original vinyl LP, I'd say...actually, I thought each side of an LP could only hold 22.5 minutes of music! Musically, it seems to be long pieces 'glued' together to with short pieces of music. Has parts you can drift off to, but other parts are cacophanous jazz or whatnot.  Maybe you could say that there are over half a dozen 'movements' in this track. Has piano, bagpipe like synth (?), electric guitar at times. Lyrics at the start of the track, but then mostly an instrumental piece. Outro is carnivalesque and some parts of the track are sort of US style rock music. Some parts have \\"Bolero\\" like drumming, it seems to me.<br /><br />The bonus tracks:<br /><br />Lady of the dancing water - maybe the vocal quality is slightly different here. This version has no acoustic guitar on it. At times, some piano notes suggested Pachelbel's \\"Canon\\".<br /><br />Bolero - might be a candidate for my \\"Jazz Influsion\\" list...it's a jazzy instrumental with the drum beats from \\"Bolero\\", perhaps (the track \\"Lizard\\" also struck me as having a nod to \\"Bolero\\" as far as the drumming pattern goes). Trumpet (Mexican style? Maybe there is a Mexican feel to other instruments too), jazzy piano, sax, tinny piano at times...swirling at other times. As far as the 'tinny' piano goes...maybe it's sort of like tin pan drums? A flute type instrument also appears.<br /><br />Cirkus - the sound doesn't seem to be captured cleanly on this track towards the end. Has some distortion. Has violins.<br /><br />Recommendations:<br /><br />King Crimson - In the court of the Crimson King<br /><br />The Mothers Of Invention - Freak out!<br /><br />Genesis - From Genesis to Revelation<br /><br />The Jazz Messengers - Moanin'.

B001OQCV2E|3.0|Roland Emmerich isn't exactly what you would call a \\"deep\\" filmmaker.  By that, I mean to infer that his films do not necessarily challenge their viewers to ponder anything meaningful or everlasting. Emmerich's attempts, more often than not, are of the popcorn variety. And \\"2012,\\" his latest, is definitely no exception.  In it, John Cusack struggles amidst a cast of thousands to save his family as the world faces its ultimate cataclysmic destruction during the very year allegedly foretold by the mayans.  That's really all that needs to be said. Anyone familiar enough with this director's repetoire should already be fully aware that eye-candy is all his overblown spectacles are about. And in that respect, in much the same unapologetic fashion as \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" this latest foray into the extreme delivers that insane level of outright fun a thousand fold! \\"2012\\" is not rocket science, it's cinematic junk food. It's all a matter of turning your brain off and enjoying the elongated ride this movie will provide you. If you're open to the idea of doing that and forgetting the everyday troubles of the real-life workaday world for a couple of hours, than you're more likely to appreciate it.  Just, please, for the love of everything you hold dear, do not expect high art! If that's what you're expecting to find, believe me when I say, you WILL be disappointed!
0439023521|5.0|Hunger Games is one of the hottest books on the market right now.  It's the story of a ruined, post-apocalyptic society in which north America is divided into twelve sectors and a somewhat fascist government is in place.  To control the population, each year two children are chosen from each district and the twenty-four contestants are forced to fight to the death.     This is a seriously addicting and fascinating book.  The writing is sharp and engaging, and the reader can't help but rout for our strong, quirky heroine, who tells the story in the first person.  She has all kinds of knowledge about the bleak realities of her world, and all kinds of ignorance about things like trust and romantic love.  I read this book in only a few days because I simply couldn't put it down.  The brutality, side by side with the ignorance and innocence is a seductive combination.     I hear talk of Hollywood snapping this one up.  They want to target teens with it, as it's a young adult book, but from what I know of ratings, that doesn't seem likely.  Any time there is violence against children--especially done by other children--and it results in death, is an automatic R-rating.  And let me just warn you, some of the stuff in this book is pretty brutal.       The off-kilter savagery, juxtaposed with moments of tenderness, is just enough to keep the reader turning the pages, and shows the author's ingenuity at her craft.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to read outside the box.  Just don't expect a Walt Disney film.    [...]

B0034G4OUY|5.0|\\"Faster\\" is great! This is how the story goes: After 10 years in prison, Driver has a singular focus - to avenge the murder of his brother during the botched bank robbery that led to his imprisonment. Now a free man with a deadly to-do list in hand, he's finally on his mission... but with two men on his trail - a veteran cop just days from retirement, and a young egocentric hitman with a flair for the art of killing and a newfound worthy opponent. The hunter is also the hunted. It's a do or die race to the list's finish as the mystery surrounding his brother's murder deepens, and new details emerge along the way hinting that Driver's list may be incomplete.    The cast led by Dwayne Johnson (as Driver) & Billy Bob Thornton (as Cop) is great! The directing by George Tillman Jr. (who also directed \\"Soul Food\\" (1997, also wrote the story & screenplay), \\"Men Of Honor\\" (2000) & \\"Notorious\\" (2009) is great!

The film editing by Dirk Westervelt (who also did the film editing to \\"Men Of Honor\\", \\"Brown Sugar\\" (2002), \\"Journey To The Center Of The Earth\\" (2008) & \\"Notorious\\") is great!

0451169514|5.0|How can one even begin and try to describe the book? It boggles my mind to even define it as something other than amazing, if I could only say one thing about it, it would be \\"read it!\\". No better way to experience a book than actually sitting down, opening the cover and reading the first page, that's all it pretty much took when I saw this on my shelf. I had it for at least 10 years and never thought of reading it until I got back on my King kick and this just called my name, it was a great three weeks that I spend absorbed in this and it was marvelous; a rich and deep story that ends up having a life of its own once the last page is read, it lives on in the reader, whether we think about it often or imagine a continuation for the characters, this is more than a book, it's a whole new set of things that you will day dream about and which will invade your daily life, it's not all sweet and funny games though, there is a lot of death and suffering and some rather dramatic moments, some of human doing and others of supernatural origin as it seems, IT is a pillar that connects two worlds together, your conscious and also the subconscious because you will be reaching into realms other than those you are used to when it comes to reading and appreciating things, it will make for some deep thinking, I absolutely loved this book and watched the movie right after, and as nice as it was it doesn't compare to the entire story which was so intricate that it took a book the size of a phone book to keep it together.     It is a story that runs at two different time lines that the reader will hope to see merge together at some point, the past and the present are on a similar course, and that course is set for disaster.  Derry, Maine ( after a while the word \\"Derry\\" gave me Goosebumps simply from reading the name of this strange town ) is in a midst of a story that flips back between 1958 and 1985, at first it was a tiny bit confusing but I got the hang of it by slowing down and taking note of the characters, pretty soon they were so well fleshed out by the writing that I would have swore they were real before I would have to refer to some list to know who they were. Bill, Ben, Richie, Beverly, Mike, Eddie and Stan ( once you read this story you can probably deduce something from a review and the order in which the reviewer picks the in, for perhaps being meaningful in some way to the reader..) are brought together, somehow they get along really well and seem to stand up to the bullies and horrid things that keep happening to them, Derry is known for it's many sad instances, stories from the past mix with new disappearances and strange murders that put the whole town on a curfew, children are dying, ripped into shreds in their own back yards, they are disappearing or being killed by something sinister and extremely mysterious. Here enters Pennywise, King's magnificent invention, a clown that is a bit more than a clown, a harbinger or things to come, some very bad and painful things. I had so many theories about this story as I read it that I must have given my boyfriend a few headaches but he discussed the story with pleasure because he enjoyed the movie but I can tell that I have infected him with the desire to read the beast itself, it's such a meaty, delicious story to sink into, the fact that it was written a while ago makes it even better, it's real as it's far out there, and finding the answers to what IT is was some great fun, it takes an open mind and some time but it's a delicious treat that is not to be missed.  There were so many battles in this, not all complying with the laws of this world but it was a magnificent story that read like the best dessert that one could indulge in, it's something I wanted to re-read soon because it was that good.  Not to spoil anything it's a great read to simply dive into; some kids come across something they survive and it haunts them into their adulthood, they must come back and discover what exactly was pushing them to the brinks of sanity and either end it for all time or surrender to whatever was making them so anxious and scared of. Partial fantasy and part painful reality this was the best of both worlds, a masterpiece from the king of horror.     - Kasia S.

1600610234|5.0|This is a very solid book for anyone who is interested in industrial fantasy art. The artwork is great and it's full of great little tips to help you improve your drawing skills. I'd say this is an intermediate skill level book-- it is not overly technical, but it also assumes you know the basics about how to draw and use photoshop. It's well worth checking out, even if just for the great art in the book itself!
B00275EHJG|5.0|I purchased this movie for my 2 year old son. He watches it at least once a day....and so do I.<br /><br />In saying that, don't take it as a bad thing. I may have seen Toy Story 3 50+ times, but each time I watch it I find a little joke or part of a scene that I missed before that makes me giggle. The movie is extremely creative and well thought out. The plot is simple, yet each scene has so many funny and creative little details in the form of actions, jokes, comments or even toys from your childhood tossed in, it makes it extremely entertaining. Each character has it's own unique personality that when they are all together in a group makes for a very funny movie.<br /><br />If you can believe it, I even have my own favorite parts that I continue to laugh at each time I watch.<br /><br />The normal sequence to movie making these days is to make the original. If it has at least moderate success, they create a sequel that completely ruins the original.<br /><br />In the case of the Toy Story series, Disney does exactly the opposite. IMO, I think the orignal was great, the second was better and the 3rd blows them both away.<br /><br />This movie is GREAT for kids.....as well as adults. If you find an adult that thinks he or she is \\"too old\\" to watch, do your best to make them watch at least the opening scene. I think they will quickly change their mind.<br /><br />This is an easy 5 star rating!

B003Y8YXEO|1.0|These remasters were made from the original 2 track masters. The remasters from 2000 were remixed as well as remastered and are far superior. A new remaster wasn't necessary, especially since this one was a major step backwards sonically. Hold on to those 2000 remasters. These ones suck. It's a shame that this is all that will be available to young folks just discovering John Lennon. Avoid these new remasters.
B0040JHXTS|5.0|As with anything nothing is perfect. But this is close. The original album never sounded better.All the extra cuts on 2 cds are either different versions of songs on Darkness and show Bruce was correct to keep working on them.The original Racing In The Streets had a 32 Ford, a 318 [a mopar motor] and fuelly heads [chevy]Those parts don't go together. He got it right with a 69 Chevy 396 and fuelly heads those bolt together.Other songs were well known, Because The Night Rendesvous and Talk To Me from live shows or given to other artists. Its nice to have studio versions. Then theres the head scrachers like the Promise and honestly most of the other songs that are so good it defies logic on why you would sit on them for 30 years!     The DVDs,The Promise  I watched twice on HBO. The 2009 Live version I would have prefered a full touring band version, Patti and Nils were missed.The real gem for me was the extra songs on part 2 and the 78 Houston Bootleg: house cut. Picture ain't perfect, but that was a jammin concert. Had boots from this period and the sound quality is so much better on this DVD. A real gem.

0838577016|5.0|This is a \\"from the ground up\\" text book that is well written and actually straightforward. Some of the research details are outdated, such as the genetics information, but even that is well rounded in what was understood ten years ago.<br />The authors have put together a very clearly written and clean presentation of what is a very difficult subject matter. This is not for the faint of determination or for the lay person without any biology or anatomy background, however. The subjects range throughout history of brain science to functional assessments of neurological and psychological disorders. Anatomy of the nervous system is detailed and thorough as is the physiology. The chapters are well defined in scope and organized well enough to allow either a straight through read or a more pick and choose section to section based on need for detailed info or interest.<br />Outstanding overall and I'll be looking forward to the next edition as well!

Admittedly, this one isn't quite as powerful, but it still earns a space on your bedside table. An eye-opening story that focuses on the role of women in war-torn Afghanistan. A tear-jerker, though certainly not on the same level as Hosseini's debut novel.
B002SF9Y8E|5.0|First of all, he's Bob Dylan and, as far as releasing material goes, he can release whatever he wants.  Say what you will, but Bob Dylan respects the music.  So it would seem Bob went into that old storage shed crammed with dusty old items, pressed metal wind-up toys, old model train parts and pieces, a box of big colorful building blocks....  And lining the bottom of a rusty old bird cage, he found an old vinyl copy of this album \\"Christmas In the Heart\\".  It was probably pressed in the 1930's or so.  Yes, this will do.  He remastered it and released it just in time for Christmas.      This is a family around the open hearth, chestnut-roasting, big beautiful shiny wrapped presents under a real Douglas Fir, hot chocolate-drinking, watch the snow fall Christmas music.  And, by the way, the best way to listen to it is on vinyl (180g, no less...again, it's Bob Dylan) released by Columbia Graphophone Co. Ltd. (?!).  You gotta look at the photos on the sleeve!      His voice is bad...really bad, to the unaccustomed ear.  But it sounds good to Dylanphiles.  Highlights throughout.  \\"Must Be Santa\\", \\"The Christmas Blues\\" and \\"Christmas Island\\" are worthy listens and a lot of fun.
1400049628|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. If you are a zombie fan it is a must read, and you've likely already done so. If you are not a zombie fan, read this book and you will likely become one. Written in the style of a manual, this book remains entertaining and unique throughout.
0061124958|5.0|Charlotte's Web is a fantastic book about friendship.  I read it with my third grade class every year.  The writing is very descriptive. There are great literary concepts that can be taught using this book, for example: characterization, dialogue, cause and effect, and story mapping.  My students always love this story and so do I.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|this moveie being the 3rd was the best yet.  It was well put together, The only thing I could have done with out was the tears at the ending.  This doesn't mean you should have done it differently, it was truely perfect the way it was.<br /><br />It just hit all the moms in the theatre the same way.  Especially for me.  I have my youngest graduating H.S. this year and then off to college.  There were a few of  us sniffeling.  The movie was truely amazing.<br /><br />Job well done Guys!  Keep it up!!!!
B0018LX9T4|3.0|Truly I think this secretary has a two main serious problems I don't understand. First and most important than nothing, it's I don't know how a wealthy lawyer from the USA has his  office plenty of electro- mechanical typewriters. No one computer or word processor is seen there. Secondly, yes, This poor  secretary have a wonderful fabulous backside for seating during so many  hours of hard work, we agree in that, but most Hollywood actress have these solid attributes and her task it's less painful. It's only this poor secretary logically commits too many errors in typewriting so much paper and it seems she merits to be punished. The lawyer, his chief, doesn't seems to be very passionate for this task, but the secretary yes, very much. I think all the problem should be solved by buying a PC. According my personal experience, a relation based over the basis of this movie cannot be durable, but one never knows, as the men she knows are much less able in beating her than she in typewriting.

0393307050|4.0|Patrick O'Brian's Master And Commander, first in the twenty book Aubrey-Maturin series, follows the travels of Captain Jack Aubrey and the voyage of his first command, the H.M.S. Sophie.    Trouble starts early when Jack realizes that the former captain of the Sophie has taken the ships surgeon with him. Jack, in a desperate attempt to man his ship before its departure the following week, invites Dr. Stephen Maturin, a man Jack has known less than forty-eight hours, to join the ship as a guest to see if he likes life at sea. Stephen, currently down on his luck, accepts and the two start a friendship that will last for years although things start out a little rocky for them as shown at their first meeting. O'Brian writes \\"For a moment Jack felt the strongest inclination to snatch up his little gilt chair and beat the white-face man down with it.\\" Thankfully, Jack does hold his temper and is later formally introduced to Stephen Maturin.    O'Brian bases the travels and adventures of Captain Aubrey on the historical feats of the daring and, more often than not, rather lucky Lord Cochrane (14 December 1775 - 31 October 1860). O'Brian  begins the series during the Napoleonic Wars and has received nods from many historians and literary critics for his historical accuracy and attention to detail.    The action in the book is engaging and full of detail and suspense. As a newly appointed captain, Jack hopes to make a name for himself. Capturing and bringing in enemy ships is the best way to become known as a Naval officer and Jack means to become very well known. Unfortunately, the most exciting battle in the book, between three eighty-gun French ships-of-the-line, and over a half dozen British vessels, is only reported to Jack third hand and leads to a rather anti-climactic ending in terms of action.    The book is filled with adventure, intrigue, and lots and lots of naval terms that the average person just wouldn't know. At times it felt like O'Brian is trying to show off his intimate knowledge of Napoleonic Era Naval terminology, but once you cut through the vocabulary lessons, Master And Commander is a wonderful book with twists and turns that can keep you turning the pages.
B003OF3R0S|2.0|I'm hoping eventually A7X will achieve a solid album start to finish.  As of yet, the whole does not equal the sum of their individual parts.  They've got a good vocalist (for the genre) and an awesome guitarist.  But this latest offering feels lazy and uninspired.  They can do better.
0142402532|2.0|I guess it depends on what you are looking for in a book. If your child is a Matilda fan she will probably love the book. This was purchased as part of my granddaughters' school reading list.  Fortunately, she switched schools and did not have to complete the book.Although she loves to read she had zero interest in the book.<br />Generally speaking the book is well written and intriguing unless of course you are trying to teach your child values (which my granddaughter's parents are). I suspect the school selected the book based on the popularity of the character and not for any other intrinsic usefulness.  I would have preferred another book for my 6 year old granddaughter.<br />We do have the movie, it is not one of her favorites nor mine.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|As a Beatles`fan since 1962, I bought everything of the Beatles material(discs, films, books)they published through the years ! Some objects I purchased twice or thrice(collector`s items etc......).  But today I`m getting quite angry about the super merchandising character of the Beatles`companies(EMI, APPLE, CAPITOL), to pressing more money out of the Beatles`fans, manipulate them  to purchase more and more stuff ? By the way: No doubt - the remastered material is very good quality(incl. covers+booklets) !Why can`t we get the Mono-albums only in that expensive box and not singular like the Stereo-albums? And - why couldn`t they edit the Beatles`albums as hybrids(Stereo+Mono on one CD)with an acceptable prize, like EMI did at the 100.anniversary with the early albums of The Hollies, G.+Pacemakers, Mannfred Mann, Peter+Gordon, etc.... ? I feel some kind of a punished fan, an old fan, spending so much money for the Beatles through all those  years ?<br />So I guess,that`s not the way to treat the many, many Beatles`fans, trying to grab their last dimes ?
0385738757|3.0|I read the first book in this series, The Maze Runner, before I started blogging, so I cannot link to a review of it. So to sum up my feelings about book one now: I read it on high recommendation and as part of my dystopia obsession and was largely disappointed. While it is decent, it's not amazing and the lack of information given to the reader about the actual world outside the test makes it hard to know whether Dashner has a neat, unique apocalyptic view of the future or not. The book basically left me kind of lukewarm.<br /><br />Book two very much follows in the tradition of book one, so I have little to add. The characters did not become any more dear to my heart in this book; in fact, I like most of them quite a bit less. Thomas spends a lot of time being emo because Teresa won't talk to him anymore; then, once she does, he's emo because she doesn't like him and he doesn't like her as much anymore either. That gets a bit trying. And, as much as I generally like for there to be a little romance in my fiction, I really could have done without it here.<br /><br />If you thought escaping the maze meant that you, the reader, would finally get to find out what is going on in the real world in this dystopia, you are going to be seriously disappointed. I had a feeling that would be the case, what with the title including the word 'trials,' which would tend to indicate that this would be another test. Still, I find myself somewhat annoyed at the fact that there is little to no added to what had been learned in The Maze Runner. I realize this is intentional and it leaves the reader feeling much like the kids in the trials: frustrated. And, although I dislike this gambit, I must admit that it works, as I do intend to keep reading the books to find out what's happening.<br /><br />If you liked The Maze Runner, read this with dispatch, because you'll love it. If you just want to know what the heck is happening in this dystopian world, then you could, if you want to, read a summary of the plot and wait for a book where the kids do something real. If you didn't like The Maze Runner, you won't like this one any better.d wait for a book where the kids do something real. If you didn't like The Maze Runner, you won't like this one any better.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|\\"With The Beatles\\" was the first step in producing the Beatles more artificially ? It was the change from Beat to Pop !  Comparing all the Beatles`Albums I must say, from the depth of my heart:<br />\\"Please, Please Me\\" is the best and most true Album, the Beatles ever had recorded ! You can hear a very fresh, young and soulful  kind of music-making ? It was the creative kind of George Martin(Thanks), to produce this LP quasi as a live-LP in the studio, because of only little time and a low budget. So the Sound was getting very more fundamental(bass-drum, drum-breaks and the  more rough kind of their singing, than on the later , more technical LP-productions. That was the excellent way to play the real cool Mersey-Beat, but in a high niveau ! That`s why, \\"I saw her standing there\\" had become  t h e e  BEAT-HYMN  of all , not to talk about \\"Twist and Shout\\" ! But don`t forget \\"There`s a place\\",\\"Baby it`s you\\" and \\"Taste of Honey\\" ? And what about \\"Chains\\" and \\"Misery\\"? That was the time, when the Beatles had to fight for acceptance and fame, and..........They showed, and everyone could feel then their big heart and much fun , in making Music, Music and Music !<br />So I have more fun to listen to this LP, than to \\"Seargeant Pepper\\", wich seems to be only technical work ?  So it`s no wonder, that The Beatles tried to catch that early spirit of making Rock-Music, when they started the \\"Get Back/Let It Be\\" Album ??? But the spirit had already flown away !<br />But last not least, there shall be no doubt:  I like all the Beatles music !<br />But I like some more and some less, whenever I differ ! If I had to go to live alone on an island and I could only take one record of the Beatles with me, I would take the LP \\"Please, Please Me\\"<br />with me !
0756405890|5.0|This book is awesome. You will not be able to put it down. And at the end you will be looking for the next one. It is not out until Feb.2011. But I'm sure it will be worth the wait. As an avid reader for over 30 years, sometimes it is hard to find a new author who will sweep you away. Patrick Rothfuss will do that and leave you waiting for more. An excellent author and I for one cannot wait to read the rest of the story!!!!!!
0307594777|5.0|The \\"Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" was a gift.  After that I was hooked.  I usually only read non-fiction but this trilogy I could not resist.  You just can not put the books down! Every spare moment I devoted to this great read.  I never read a book a second time, but these I just might.  They are ready for me on the top of my chest of drawers.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|I am a typical \\"Dirty Dozen\\", John Wayne, \\"Open Range\\" kind of guy. But a number of years ago I was forced by my wife to watch the A & E production of Pride and Prejudice on VHS. Years later, the story works on me like comfort food. I have given the original DVD set, as a gift many times. This Blu-ray version has been remastered. The audio has been reworked and the soundtrack enhanced. I should complain about the film grain that now appears because of the clarity of the Blu-ray media, or that there are some artifacts visible in some scenes, but this is simply modern media surpassing the film and mastering that the original film was produced on in 1995. The audio clarity is much better, meaning the dialogue is easier to understand; and the remixing of the music bed has a positive effect on the emotion of the story.   Enough of this sappiness. I'm going to go watch Tora, Tora, Tora.
B001IXSU8M|4.0|She is very talented, and has some good songs on this album like Poker Face, LoveGame, Just Dance, and Boys Boys Boys, but she is a very weird person. She's original and unique but her image and some of her song lyrics are just plain strange (and her music videos). She has catchy songs, so music wise I like her.
0765356147|5.0|A great ending to the Mistborn Trilogy. As usual, Sanderson starts off slowly and picks up the pace near the middle/end. Within the book, we see how the team and world has coped with the increasing mists and ash, after the release of a very dark force in book 2. One year has gone by since book 2 and the team has been slowly getting clues about who and what Ruin is. The main viewpoint characters continue to be Vin, Elend, and Sazed, but with an interesting addition...Spook. In book three we see him come into his own through a rebellion in a Western city.<br /><br />I won't say that the book will have you gripped right away; that just isn't how Sanderson works. But once you get immersed, it'll be hard to stop reading. The epigraphs of each chapter are very telling, unlike the ones in book 2, and you will have many of your questions that you've had since book 1 answered. The story is more or less wrapped up in a nice little bow, but has also been left open enough for additional Mistborn stories later on (which, I might add, Sanderson has said one will come out sometime next year). All in all, if you are a fan of Sanderson and Mistborn, you'll enjoy this conclusion.

B002ZG976U|3.0|\\"Burlesque\\" is a visually splendid musical brought down by a severe lack of originality. There isn't a plot point, a character, a theme, a dance routine, or even a song style that hasn't already been seen and heard in other musicals. Take, for example, the moment Christina Aguilera enters the titular club; on stage, a troupe of scantily-clad young women dance lewdly around Cher as she welcomes the audience with a song. She sings about the club. She sings about the girls. She points to the orchestra, which play right on the stage. Watching this, I thought of how good this scene could have been if it hadn't already been done in \\"Cabaret.\\" It also seems as if the music and lyrics are a little too reminiscent of Kander and Ebb. Even the choreography feels like Joey Pizzi and Denise Faye peeked into the teacher's edition of a Bob Fosse dancing textbook.    Aguilera plays Ali, a waitress from a middle-of-nowhere town who dreams of hitting it big as a singer and dancer. Determined to make something of herself, she buys a one-way bus ticket to Los Angeles. While job hunting in Hollywood, she happens upon The Burlesque Lounge, a glamorously lascivious nightclub run by the headliner, Tess (Cher). Although tough, Tess takes Ali under her wing; at the same time, Ali makes an enemy out of a temperamental and boozy performer named Nikki (Kristen Bell). Ali quickly lands a job as a cocktail waitress, and after a lot of coaxing and begging (aided by the convenient sudden pregnancy of one of the showgirls), she gets to take part in the show, which, at Tess' insistence, consists of dancers lip synching to previously recorded songs. But when Nikki stops the music in a fit of jealousy, Ali lets loose a set of pipes the likes of which no one at The Burlesque Lounge - Tess least of all - has ever heard.    Intertwined with this is a subplot involving the failing financial state of the club, pitting Tess against her ex-husband, Vince (Peter Gallagher), whose sweaty skin, matted hair, andruffled clothes give him the appearance of a man who hasn't slept in at least three days. We also focus on a budding romance between Ali and a Burlesque bartender named Jack (Cam Gigandet), the latter offering his apartment as a safe haven after Ali's place is robbed. They spend most of the first and second act playing coy with one another, until that fateful moment when Jack walks past Ali wearing nothing - although he does strategically cover himself with an open box of cookies. Their love is quickly threatened by the arrival of Marcus Gerber (Eric Dane), a suave, magnetic entrepreneur eager to tempt Ali with promises of becoming a star. He also has his eye on The Burlesque Lounge, primarily because that's what's expected of guys like him in movie musicals like this.    All the songs come to life within the context of the stage, each displaying a dreamy showbiz glitziness similar to the fantasy sequences in Rob Marshall's \\"Chicago.\\" It's great to look at, and yet it forces a certain degree of detachment, since, even within the scope of Hollywood outrageousness, it seems unlikely that such a club could ever exist there. Apart from that, no real effort is made to show us something we haven't already seen before. Even Cher's solo number is overwhelmingly contrived. Imagine it. It's after hours. Everyone has gone home. She steps on stage and insists on rehearsing. She then sits on a lone chair, bathed in the glow of a spotlight while a power ballad crescendos to life. And yes, the prerecorded song on the CD just happens to accurately reflect her emotional state at that very moment. The song is called \\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me,\\" and it was written by Diane Warren, known for ballads such as \\"Un-Break My Heart,\\" \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,\\" and \\"There You'll Be.\\"    I will give both the leads credit. I don't need to say a lot about Cher; she has already established herself as an actress, and she has the Oscar to prove it. As for Aguilera, she marks her featurefilm debut with a decent, believable, entertaining performance - decent enough, in my opinion, to warrant opportunities for future film roles. And there's no denying her soulful, resonant singing voice, one of the few decent ones belonging to an ex-Mouseketeer. Unfortunately, all the singing in the world can't save a musical if there isn't an engaging story, well developed characters, and some sense that the filmmakers are trying something new. \\"Burlesque,\\" while certainly pleasant on the eyes, is flat, uninspired, and lifeless.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Just out of sheer observation of how lame society is nowadays, i tend to instantly shun whatever is embraced by the masses.  This may sound ignorant, but it has saved me from watching insufferable crap like \\"jersey shore\\", \\"sarah palin's alaska,\\" \\"the real world\\", \\"nick swardson's pretend time,\\" Lady gaga *vomits*, gay Z, lil wayne, and other talentless hacks that prey on the stupidity of the masses with regurgitated gimmicks.    That being said, I was hesitant seeing this movie everyone was talking about.  But people wouldn't shut up about it, so i went to go see it.  Besides, for years ive been interested in lucid dreaming, so i figured it would be interesting to say the least.    the movie was INCREDIBLE.  I loved it.  I went to see it again the day after i saw it the first time.  Sure, they dont touch on a lot of stuff that you can do in lucid dreaming, but that didnt matter, because the movie plain and  simply kicked ass.  Im getting this as soon as it comes out, it's just one of those epic movies that so many different things happen during the plot that you don't get bored with it.  Highly recommend watching this if you've been looking for a good movie.
0553288105|4.0|Few science fiction writers are as imaginative as Asimov in the realm of differentiating the physical qualities of alien life from that of humans.  The Gods Themselves deals with a parallel universe that includes a life form so original and different from humans yet truly believable in every quality, a testament to the quality of the Asimov's imagination.<br /><br />The story involves power struggles in both universes dealing with a potentially unlimited energy source discovered as a result of the different laws of physics among each universe.  As significant as this discovery turns out to to be, the ramifications of using the pump system that draws energy from these differences proves to be far more daunting.  Asimov tells the story from the views of both universes which are totally unalike in almost every way.<br /><br />Among Asimov's greatest talents is his ability to tell a story based on complicated science in an easily read format.  This is the style of book where one can blast through fifty pages at a time without missing a beat.  With so many science books available, reading any of Asimov's works is always a safe bet, and in particular the Gods Themselves easily rates high.
B000SXOI66|3.0|Needless to say, this is a great classic album.  The way it was chopped into songs without the full endings, ruined the whole thing for me.

B0042AEOG0|3.0|I used to be a huge fan of Mariah Carey's, and I loved her Merry Christmas album...<br /><br />Then she decided to reinvent herself, started focusing on her sex appeal and not on her talent, and basically became someone I don't even pay attention to any more.<br /><br />I thought this album would be better, and would be a return to what once made Mariah Carey great to listen to. I was mistaken. There are a couple good tracks on here, but for the most part, the album just reminds me that this was once a talented artist, and she still hasn't recaptured that which once made her great.<br /><br />I really can't recommend this album to anyone, unless they like the modern version of Mariah Carey.
B00000ILDF|5.0|I think this movie is/was great. That is, extremely enjoyable entertainment. If you like to over critique a film rather than just having liked it for what it is/was, then you can find flaws in ANY film. If you itemize and compare every detail to the others in the series, or to ALL films, then you can't relax and enjoy a movie, even if it is in your favorite genre (this is in mine) you are bound to be disappointed. I prefer to indulge myself and lose myself in the movie. That is what Sci-Fi is ALL about!!!.!!..!...it is a fantasy world...fiction...and when the acting is above par, you can swallow just about anything!!!.!!..!... This installment is different in many ways from the first two, but it continues the story in a refreshing new way. That is how life is, it is not the same all the time, if it were it would be very boring. Diversity is often interesting and/or fun; just like this film!!!  [[ASIN:B00000ILDF Alien 3]]  I enjoyed all the films in this series so much that I purchased several copies/versions ( all four (4) of them ).

1400079144|5.0|I enjoyed reading \\"The Lost Symbol,\\" however, in my opinion this is not a smooth or easy reading.  Since I had heard about Freemasons and Masonic Lodge in my childhood, I was keen on knowing more about them.   This book encompasses many discussions about moral values, philosophy, religion, and the peculiar life style of Masons, which are presented in an attractive manner.  Furthermore, the discussions are seamlessly merged with a thrilling story. Professor Langdon comes across as an ideal person who is an expert in decoding ancient symbols and the reader wants to see that he does not come to any harm.  Mulakh the villain of the story has been painted as the cruelest, merciless brute, who possesses an extraordinary physical strength.  We are neither surprised nor shocked, because we live in a world where cruelty has become so commonplace.     To me the most intriguing part of this book is the description of the interior structure of the building.  There are so many secret places and the doors require a series of keys and passwords to unlock them.  In order to keep the secrets a mystery, Masons have built a very complicated structure.  Such structures were hard for me to visualize even after reading the book.   Right at the end the reader experiences a sense of terror and comes in for a huge surprise.  This is where I feel Dan Brown emerges as one of our great novelists.  Finally, I would like to summarize what I have learned about Masons from this novel:  Free Masons are like Shriners.  Every member of Freemasons is duty bound to take an oath of secrecy and loyalty to their organization.      They believe in the worldwide brotherhood, equality and one Supreme Being.  They have innumerable secret codes, rituals, and worshipping methods.  Their dealings are not transparent to the public.  Masons firmly believe that human mind has an enormous potential and knowledge will help them to expand it.  Their credo is: a fully developed mind can transform the matter.        TheMasons apply scientific principles and logic in all their discussions and think that by understanding the secrets of nature they will obtain the mystical power.  This approach of combining religion and science, in my opinion, is what must have attracted Dan Brown to delve deep into the life style of Masons and spend five years in research finding the meaning of symbols, artifacts and in the deciphering of the code language. The importance of 33 degree in the hierarchy of power has an attention-grabbing explanation. (Dan Brown did research in Smithsonian research center, in Capitol Rotunda, and in many Washington Monuments.  He saw the code language and symbols on the walls of these great places.)   It was a surprise to know that many Presidents were members of the Freemason Society.  This is not a novel for the novel sake but a novel for thinkers. However, the questions such as, why men always are so power crazy still remain unanswered.  Symbols, code language, mysterious ways of celebrations and keeping everything extremely secretive is one  way of holding to power and that is what FREEMASONS did.  I strongly recommend this book if you are interested in a serious thriller.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I love this movie.  I love Neil Patrick Harris's voice, what an amazing voice. I love the music, and storyline.  By far my favorite movie.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|I received this CD to review for the One2One Network and I loved this CD just as I have loved all her other ones!  If you like Norah Jones than buy this CD.  Great music.  Great musicians.  I highly recommend it!
B0027ZEHGO|4.0|We The People think very highly of ourselves.  And why not; from a very early age Americans are told that they are number one; that we live in the greatest country on earth.  America has the strongest military (that much is true up to a point), the best primary education system (not true), the best economic system (despite that fact that it keeps failing us), the best government (highly dysfunctional at the moment), and the the health care system (so not true).<br /><br />That fact is by many objective measurements the United States is no longer number one and while most Americans refuse to acknowledge that fact, the rest of the world is catching on!  We have been coasting on past achievements for quite some time; the evidence is quite clear, and yet most Americans still drink the nationalist Kool-Aid labeled \\"we're number one.\\"<br /><br />Facts are facts, and here is a sobering one: our national health care system is a national disgrace and is failing us.  It is not the best in the world; in fact it is fast becoming one of the worst.  By so many (health) scales Americans are falling behind; we have the worse infant mortality rate of any western industrialized nation--and some third world countries as well--with 6.9 deaths per 1000 births according a 2009 CDC study.  That puts us behind (according to the CIA Fact Book) countries like Cuba (5.72 per 1000 births), Canada (4.99 per 1000 births), United Kingdom (4.78 per 1000 births), France (3.31 per 1000 births), and Singapore (2.32 per 1000 births).  Telling isn't it that all of these nations have national health care?<br /><br />Close to 50 million of our fellow citizens are uninsured, which means they cannot afford to get sick.  And even those of us that have health care insurance are at the mercy of our health care insurance companies and playing Russian roulette with our lives and those of our family members.  The U.S.--according to the CIA Fact Book--currently ranks number 49 in life expectancy behind every other industrialized nation and Israel!<br /><br />Into this breach, this national and international disgrace, this maddening debacle steps Michael Moore and his seminal 2007 documentary Sicko wherein Mr. Moore takes just a slice of the American health care system and dares to compare it with other nations.  Throughout Sicko Moore, in his own determined style, tells the stories of real Americans who have been failed by our (very) broken health care system, but he only scratches the surface of the boil.<br /><br />In Sicko Mr. Moore does not speak in-depth to the uninsured, but tackles instead the insured, those of us who have health insurance coverage, but may soon learn that it is not enough, or that we got sick in the wrong place, or used the wrong Emergency Care service, or were taken to the wrong hospital when our child is sick...The list of strange but true tales in Sicko are at once heart-breaking, sad, maddening, frustrating and tragic.  How could this happen in America to Americans?<br /><br />It can happen because the American (for profit) Health Care System, despite Republican Party platform dogma, and Tea-Party & Sarah Palin Death Panel claims, is broken!  While most Americans are worried that under a National Health Care System the government will interfere in doctors decisions; nameless, faceless, heartless insurance company functionaries are already doing so!<br /><br />In Sicko, Mr. Moore dares to compare our for-profit health care system with the much-maligned (by the political right, and other who advance the cause of profits and states right above human life) not-for-profit Universal Health Systems of Canada, France, The United Kingdom, and brace yourself, Cuba.  In each case he sets about debunking some of the commonly held--in the United States anyway--myths about these highly functional and highly successful health care systems.  What he found will not be surprising to anyone paying attention; and that is citizens of those four nations enjoy free health care and nearly free pharmaceuticals delivered in a humane and timely manner.<br /><br />Mr. Moore also debunks the commonly held American myth that higher taxes means a lower standard of living, interviewing a French couple whose standard of living is every bit as good as an American middle-class citizen, and I dare say better, because they were guaranteed at least five weeks of paid vacation time and had traveled the world with their children.  Despite their high tax rate, the couple showed off an apartment that would be on-par with any in the United States.<br /><br />In perhaps the most controversial segment of Sicko, Moore takes the 9/11 rescue workers, who are unable to receive and afford medical care in the U.S., to Guantanamo Bay Cuba wherein free health care is being provided for the enemy combatants detained therein.  The group arrives at the entrance channel to \\"Gitmo\\" and Moore uses a megaphone to request access, pleading for the 9/11 victims to receive treatment that is on par with the medical attention the \\"evildoers\\" are receiving. Of course he does not gain entrance so the group moves on to Havana, where they receive free medical treatment by providing only their names and dates of birth, and purchase inexpensive pharmaceuticals.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br /><br />At one point near the end of Sicko Moore asks: \\"what kind of people are we?\\"  Indeed, it is a question I have often asked myself.  What is keeping the nation from embracing national health care?<br /><br />Even the casual observer can see that we--Americans--are our own worst enemy.  Despite the statistics, the 60 Minutes stores about American without health care insurance having to visit free clinics, the horror stories that came out during the recent health care debates, and numerous stories done by NPR and other new outlets details the enumerable failings of the American Health Care System, and Sicko, as a society we still cling to the notion that nothing is amiss.  Or if something is wrong it must be the patient's fault.  It is a combination of pure folly, political misinformation, misplaced patriotism & arrogance, self-induced ignorance & fear, and greed that keep this nation from adopting National Health Care.<br /><br />Sicko is just one of many warning bells that Americans have failed to heed.  Our nation, our way of life, our standard of living, are all on the decline.  We as a nation lack the political and social will to tackle our problems head on (when did that happen?) and as a result this festering boil is never lanced.<br /><br />We--Americans--have reached a point where we fear our government (thanks to Ronald Regan, the Republican Party, Rush Limbaugh, festering ignorance, and Fox News employees) more than we do private industry.  And private industry has time and again proven itself less than angelic and trustworthy in American society, yet we seem to by-and-large trust the insurance companies despite all of the evidence that points to the fact they \\"they\\" place profits above human life.

B003XTUZIM|5.0|Lizard and Islands have always been the two Crimson albums closest to my heart, so when I heard they were to be released in 5.1 DVD audio, I was quite thrilled. No amount of anticipation could have prepared me for the acutal experience of these amazing reissues.  Listening to these works, one forgets the technology involved, and is absorbed into the beauty of Fripp's brilliance. One must be forwarned however. Being exposed to such sonic perfection will make ANY mp3 sound flat and weak by comparison. I am currently re-burning all my CD's into wave files for home listening. Now that storage is not a cost issue, I can no longer limit my experience for the sake of portability. Islands, as an LP, or early CD release, has suffered from the wide range of volume in the recording, especially in songs like \\"the letter\\", and \\"ladies of the road\\".  The low volume parts had signal to noise problems, and the loud parts verged on clipping.  This new version has non of these problems.  I was able to enjoy total emmersion into the soundscape, bringing me to tears on \\"song of the gulls\\".  I am so grateful for the geeks holed up in studios producing this kind of work, whether its the beatles or roxy music being reformed.  If you like Islands, this is a must.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|I like the science fiction genre.  I find wonder in outer space, fascination in the prospect of finding life among the stars.  But what if life came from outer space and you know, hung around Earth for a while and interacted with humans?  And what if said life was housed in a concentration camp?  And said life had an affinity for cat food, rubber, and violence?  And said life was intelligent enough to master intergalactic travel yet savage enough to eat raw human flesh?  Such is the premise of District 9 (2009).<br /><br />Story-Line<br /><br />District 9 opens over the clear blue sky of Johannesburg, South Africa as several people narrate the story of how the alien creature referred to as \\"prawns,\\" came to the planet and get stranded here. For months nothing is heard from the hovering ship and finally the powers to be cut into the ship and find up to 1 million \\"prawns\\" starving and feeding off one another and evacuate them to the surface and fence them off in an area called District 9.<br /><br />The protagonist in the violent and bloody little tale is one Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) a mid-level manager who works for the Multi National United (MNU) who has been given the unforgivable task of clearing out District 9 and relocating the extraterrestrials to a newer district with tents.<br /><br />District 9 has become a cesspool wherein the visiting aliens live off each other and human cast-off's.  Nigerian gangs have been allowed to move in and prey off the aliens running black market prostitution and collecting for themselves alien bio-weaponry that can only be fired by the extraterrestrials.  So the Nigerians have introduced voodoo and mysticism forwarding the premise that eating Prawn flesh will allow access to the weapons.<br /><br />While searching one house Wikus Van De Merwe happens upon a black vile which he stupidly opens and it splashes a black liquid into this face.  And over the next 72 hours he changes as the alien DNA supplants his own and he slowly \\"turns\\" into a prawn left hand first.<br /><br />Meanwhile Wikus Van De Merwe's wife Tania Van De Merwe (Vanessa Haywood) is the traumatized wife.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />District 9 is certainly a different kind of SciFi movie, one that ultimately leaves a multitude of questions in is bloody wake.  Chief among these is why the extraterrestrials came to Earth in the first place?  Were they bent on conquest and something happen?  The movie hints that they ran out of fuel, but they demonstrated the ability to make more, so...Second question: with no fuel to run the ship, how was it able to hover above Johannesburg?  Third question: why were these seemingly advanced species content to stay within the confines of District 9.  With their advanced weaponry and obvious intellect, they could have easily have taken over the city, so...<br /><br />Questions aside, I did enjoy District 9.  Sharlto Copley did a stellar job portraying the naïve bureaucrat who while showing an admirable understanding of the aliens, even speaking their language, nonetheless demonstrated little respect for them.<br /><br />As he begins morphing into one of the prawns, and is discovered by the evil heads of MUN, who seek to dissect him (for their own greedy desires of course), Wikus Van De Merwe has to go on the run eventually ending up in District 9.  His transformation from clueless desk-jockey to battle-hardened half human is intriguing to watch because he does such a great job.<br /><br />The metaphors this movie introduces are so obvious I need not point them out, sufficed to say District 9 pulls no punches when it comes to the portrayal of naked racism and violence directed toward our extraterrestrials visitors.  And did I mention exploitation?<br /><br />By the end of most science fiction movies I feel largely disconnected from the story, probably because the action takes place in a land far, far away.  With District 9 I did experience that same disconnectedness and that's thepoint the movie is supposed to leave the audience winded, shaken and thinking about our supposed humanity.shaken and thinking about our supposed humanity.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I was so delighted that I did not order the previous release of just the two-disc edition... because I would have regretted if I did so because of the other stuff that is included in the 3-Disc Extended Collector's Edition.    I really like what they put in here... But I just wished that the contents of the DVD edition and Blu-Ray edition were the same (except for the BD live probably)... I just felt that the studios are forcing us to really buy a Blu-Ray player in order to see all the wonderful bonus features that are exclusive to BD Live.    I also wished that they sticked with the plastic case because the one I got goes with a metal case. It's not very sturdy and it's very sensitive - can be easily dented.    Overall I liked it because of the added features. Also we are given the option to see three versions of the movie. If only they released the extended collector's edition and put the entire movie in one disc and had all the features in the other two... that would've been nice.    Anyway, if you're an AVATAR Fan, you should definitely get this... It's worth it.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I'd give this a 4 star if I were comparing it to the previous books. It's slow to start and lacks the fire of the previous stories. It's still wonderful and engrossing and there were times when I couldn't put it down.
B000S6LT42|5.0|Two full concerts and then peices from three differant areas that tour went,including the first ever stop in China. The documentary is an actual documentary with a mini doc from the Half Time show. I loved it. The Argentina show proved that Rock n Roll is ageless,the crowd is a sea of young people from my generation and I dare say younger,who are acting like its 1967 and Mick is fresh faced. This is the original bad and dirty rock and roll doing it like its meant to be done.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|After seeing the cast on Oprah celebrating their 45th anniversary, I immediately ordered the package from Amazon.[[ASIN:B000Y5JFNY The Sound of Music (Limited Edition Collector's Set) [Blu-ray/DVD Combo]]] It was a great value and enjoyed by our entire family over Thanksgiving. All the extras were well worth it, especially the music box. Great memories...
B004AUGJS8|5.0|We found this movie to be very entertaining and thought provoking. It provides a steady build of suspense. It was interesting that it was based on a true story.   I would recommend this movie to viewers.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I am not always able to know when a Parker/Selleck feature is playing on TV and so I am happy to find this and the others of this series available on DVD. I am tempted to buy all six and be sure to find the seventh when it appears next year. Well written, good entertainment. Not normal pablum that you usually find.
030014332X|5.0|I just bought it last week and have been reading it, yes although I've bought for my kids but I like to read it first then I can share and help my kids to understand it better during reading it. Definitely it is a really interesting books about our world history for kids.
B003TML0VO|5.0|If you're a guitar player this CD is a must for your collection.  I can't even began to explain what he does on this album and I think it will be some time before I can come up with the words.  Buy it, and enjoy it.
B002ZG976U|2.0|If you are a Christina Aguilera fan and want to see her sing then this is a good movie for you. If you want to see something related to modern burlesque then you need to go to a live burlesque show because there is no burlesque in this movie. I'm guessing since the names \\"Cabaret\\" and \\"Showgirls\\" had been used, Steve Antin chose \\"Burlesque\\". It isn't a horrible movie but you have seen the plot many times before. Xtina's acting is passable and it's fun to see Cher even briefly. The dancing is knock off Bob Fosse but Aquilera's voice is in top form and there is a lot of it. It is a nearly two hour long music video. It is a better movie than other pop princess movies like \\"Glitter\\" or \\"Crossroads\\" but not nearly as good as other modern musicals like \\"Chicago\\", \\"Dream Girls\\" or the above mentioned \\"Cabaret\\". If you are interested in real modern burlesque, do a search for Dita Von Teese, Immodesty Blaize, Jo Weldon, Miss Indigo Blue or the Pontani Sisters. As the review in the Christian Science Monitor put it, This movie is about as much about burlesque as \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" is about Swan Lake.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|Desperate Housewives is one of my favorite shows and I am so glad I bought it on amazon! It was fast cheap shipping and packaged carefully. The transaction went very smoothly and would suggest to buy this DVD here.     This is a social writeup
B0040JHWKS|3.0|The good news here may very well be the remastered Darkness.  I can't afford it; somebody please give me one.  Is it better than the 1/2 speed mastered vinyl version?  The CD that I have is pretty darn good, so I'm good.    Anywho, this is a 2 CD set with 22 songs on it.  It's essential for the completist Bruce fan like me.    Out of the 22, there are some that are super and some not so much. Even after reading the reviews, I can't see how this set merits a 5 star rating from anybody.  5 stars is Darkness or BTR.  Or Dark Side of the Moon, or Who's Next, or Year of the Cat by Al Stewart.    I'm happy to see some songs (Talk to Me), disappointed with others (Because the Night), and wondering why some are even in there.    Are you a new fan?  Try everything through 1984 before this one.    Just a comment here: the 1975 Roxy live Thunder Road from the 1975-1985 set sounds so good.  Why not release that whole show?
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Currently the best CPU on the market for highly-threaded applications. Also the best CPU on the market in terms of value (price/performance). The average computer user probably wouldn't notice the difference, but this CPU would run a tad slower than an i7 under \\"general computer use\\" applications. In my opinion, if you want speed, without breaking the bank, go AMD. If you want the fastest processor on the market overall, at any cost, look to Intel. This chip is a beast, and puts out a beastly amount of heat to match...be sure to have adequate cooling (both heatsink/cpu cooler and case ventilation) and a proper power supply before just throwing this in your AM3 system. Also note before buying that this CPU has a 125w TDP, which not all AM3 motherboards can support. Always reference your board's factory tested component compatability chart before making a purchase.<br /><br />The short version...there is nothing subtle about this CPU.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I wish I found this game sooner! I have game nights a lot with friends and we LOVE this game.  The talking/shouting never ends.  It provides us with hours of fun and laughter.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|Not very often are the 2nd seasons better then the 1st, but in this case it was.  This was like a good book that you can't put down.  It had me wanting to watch more from the 1st episode.  The twists and turns that the story takes and the characters are fantastic!  I can not wait to watch the 3rd season! If you have never watched Damages before I would HIGHLY recommend it!
B002ZG98J6|5.0|The movie was very well done. I wish I had seen it earlier while it was out on the big screen. I think it got overshadowed by Avatar. Effects were decent and the story kept moving and kept me entertained. Nice detail in the blue ray.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I hate the high prices of going to the theaters. However, I could not miss this movie in 3D on the big screen. The $11, for me, was worth it and I'm a cheap ass.<br /><br />I'm also a HUGE RE die-hard fan. I love the fact that they change it up a bit with the characters and make new situations for the movies. How boring would it be to see each of the games (which I have played many times over and still love) played out in a movie? I want new and bigger/better scenarios and situations. It makes it feel like you're in a new video game that you don't have to control. You just sit back and enjoy!<br /><br />I think the producers/directors/writers did a wonderful job with presenting Chris Redfield in this movie. They incorporated certain things from the RE5 game into this latest movie (such as the mind erasing jem attached to Claire's chest, the large double sided axe swinging villian, and the fact that Jill isn't really dead!).<br /><br />To me, this is the best RE movie yet and I can't wait for the next one. The movies keep getting better and better. Milla Jovovich also fits the character of Alice very well.
B003YOZNBU|5.0|Not a fan of Westerns usually, but add the element of the supernatural and I am hooked. The only drawback was the fact that after the movie was over, I smelled of gun smoke for days.
0439023513|5.0|I LOVED all three of these books. I will admit, this one left me still with questions and there were certain things that were unresolved. But isn't that life? It doesn't always have a happy ending or even a tragic ending- sometimes its a mix of both with things left undone and deep wounds left unhealed. If you have it set in your mind how things should end, be ready to be disappointed, but you really should be used to Collins completely taking you off guard after reading the first 2 books. She doesn't do the expected, and they'd be boring if she did! Read these books, you won't regret it. And as you do, stop and think about how similar Panem is to our world at large today- and we in the US live much closer to the Capital that we do to District 12. Just something to think about. Thank you Suzanne Collins for writing such a wonderful series!
0439023491|4.0|Love this series. Am about half way through Mockingjay. Katniss is an amazing character. Especially as far as women in novels go. And Collins always keeps her human and honest and she stays consistent to her personality not to just to where the story has to go. I just can't help but think of the \\"Pretties\\" series with the Capitol and the controlling government and the \\"one\\" who changes everything. Especially with the hovercrafts(hoverboards) and the Capitol surgeries. It is very pretty making. That being said there are so many sci-fi novels about government control and rebellion and the \\"one\\" who leads the people. And besides Collins' writing far surpasses whoever the author was of the \\"Pretties\\" series. When I read Pretties I definately felt like it was a young adult book where as this series can be enjoyed by everyone old and young. It has universal appeal and Collins' writing style is very succinct to the point and keeps you glued to every page without being dumbed down. God I hope they do these books justice with the movie version. it could truly be an instant classic. But I have little faith in Hollywood these days.
B0000041TD|5.0|I am a true opera novice. I only recently started listening to Opera after a few weeks ago I was dragged to see one at the Metropolitan Opera.  Didn't expect to love the show or even to grow to love the music, but I did!  When I got home I decided to purchase the Album and got this one as it had great reviews.  I've an Elementary or lower-intermediate knowledge of Italian and this helps someone like me to appreciate this art form even more.  In fact listening actually helps me improve my italian after a while. I don't know anything about crescendos or arias or allegros or why a conductor waves those drumsticks around or whatever- but I can say that there is SO much emotion coming from many of singers voices on this recording.  My friends think I'm crazy when I put it on because we tended to be more of a Rock, Pop and Alternative-Jazz crowd. I just love this album and I've listened to it almost every day since receiving it.
0385737955|1.0|For some reason Thomas is perfect in everything he does. He is super-lucky and really has no faults besides being ignorant of what is going on with the Maze. The author gives an explanation for his perfection later on as simple brilliance, but it's not a very good explanation. Other characters also feel one-dimensional although the cook has some thinking to him.<br /><br />The maze puzzle itself as a concept is interesting, but not so much that the poor quality of the characters can be ignored. There isn't a lot of information given, and it's in keeping with the lack of information provided to the inhabitants of this Maze world. The problem is that none of the other kids seem to have theories about what is going on.<br /><br />This might be interesting for someone who is just getting into sci-fi and/or dystopian fiction, but you would be better off reading Ender's Game.
0061537934|5.0|This is a fast and easy read especially for anyone who likes dogs. It is a different perspective on a story line. A good book!
0441009425|4.0|This is hardcore sci-fi and very dense so not for the casual reader. The plot is fairly complex, and it takes awhile for all the pieces to converge and begin to make sense. The general science concepts aren't too hard to understand though which is a good thing. The author has a PHD in astronomy so the sience is supposed to be pretty good although I don't pay too much attention to those details because the story is what compels me in books.<br /><br />There is certainly never a dull moment in the book despite the feeling sometimes that you've read a lot and for some reason the book is still almost all unread still. The societies in this book are interesting and well-thought out as are the shifts in power.<br /><br />One major problem with the book is how often points of view shift often without warning so it takes a few seconds to figure out that the focus is elsewhere. The shifts get less jarring as the book goes on as characters meet, but in the beginning it can be very off-putting. It's a pretty good book though and great for people love hardcore sci-fi (I like, not love, to read them).
B0024FA9IM|2.0|Back when I watched this movie when it was first released, I remember thinking it was quite fun.  I had the chance to watch it again recently, and was looking forwards to doing so.  Unfortunately, there was very little about the movie to enjoy.  The acting was weak, the characters uninteresting and under-developed, the plot was simplistic and the conflict not particularly exciting.  The quality of the environments varied from obviously fake, to pretty nice looking.  All in all, it was a barely okay movie.  I liked it more when I was a kid.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Got 2 cables for my new samsung 1080p tv.  Plugged in and the picture is awesome.  Don't believe the salespeople at the electronics store that try to convince you to spend 50$ and up for fancy cables.  These are inexpensive and give perfect picture.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|kindle book pricing aside, this book is a real page turner. i liked it so much that i am starting the camel club series from the beginning.
B003N7GATM|4.0|Basically this totally reminds me of a Pig-face album from 10 years ago. Not quite as 80's sounding and repetitious, But definitely industrial in the real sense.
B003UESJGK|5.0|I was very surprised to find this movie to my liking. I went (rather grudgingly I'll admit) to see this movie and I was blown away, it wasn't just a comedy, it wasn't just a romance, it was a deep, intricate experience that mirrors (to the best of hollywood's ability) the real relational component that we never really know what will come next with any of our relationships. This movie throws you for several unexpected twists and turns but this is one not to miss! Do be warned it's rated R for a reason, you see just about everything Hathaway and Gyllenhaal have to offer. Ultimately its a heartwarming story about a man who had never found a desire to approach anything with all of his heart and/or ability until he meets Maggie, then everything changes. This will definitely be added to my personal collection just as soon as it comes on DVD.
B002WJI63A|4.0|I brought this toy for my niece. I am very happy with the condition and wrapping of this toy. It arrived early which is perfect. It looks just like princess peach does from the video games and is clean and a great size for playing with and taking places thank you.
B003KZZ4TO|5.0|My vinyl had a scratch that made it impossible to listen thru without interruption.  But then I realized that, hey I have to flip the darm thing anyway.

How do you make a movie with this many characters and not one minority of any sort in it. Shame on Jim Carrey for allowing that. After all it was only the Wayan Brothers, (two black guys) that made him famous. Nobody knew who he was until, In living Color. And by the way the movie sucked, definitely not for kids. Waste of money

0439023513|5.0|The third and final book in The Hunger Games series.<br /><br />****Spoilers for both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire****<br /><br />It's hard to see a much loved series come to an end, especially when the final book is as dark and brutal as Mockingjay is.<br /><br />Picking up where Catching Fire ended, the Districts are on the verge of a revolution against The Capital.  Hoping to have a symbol of the uprising President Coin, leader of the rebels beseeches Katniss to become the Mockingjay and bring some optimism to the rebellion.  This is not an all's well that ends well conclusion to the series. Katniss and Peeta have paid a huge price for their involvement in The Hunger Games. We are not sure of Peeta's fate, although it is clear that he has been subjected to torture by President Snow and his army.  Katniss seems to have completely disappeared into a scared and tormented young woman, hiding away and reliving the games in her head. The brave and courageous Katniss is gone; a tired, haunted shell is all that is left. But she is The Mockingjay and now instead of being the pawn of President Snow, she is the Pawn of Coin, the leader of the rebellion. As `good' as the `good guys' may be it is still a war and all is fair in love and war. That becomes abundantly clear as the book races to its climatic ending.<br /><br />This is a very dark end to the series. I don't think there could have been a different end than the one Collins wrote. It isn't going to please a lot of people but it is honest. Surviving and living isn't necessarily the same thing. There is a glimmer of hope in the Epilogue, but in order to get there you still need to live through the present.  A bittersweet ending, but happily ever after is for fairy tales and Disney movies.  The Hunger Games were neither of these

Dispite this the story lines are solid and the characters all give great preformances.  This is deffinatly one of these series that any good sci fi lover should own.
0061743526|5.0|Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.<br /><br />This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.<br /><br />A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.<br /><br />Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.<br /><br />I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0670010952 Harper Lee (Up Close)]]
B004BSDKUE|5.0|I really don't know why people give Nicki such a hard time.  Its not easy being a female rap artist these days, and I'm quite glad that she's putting the them back on the charts again.<br />  I have to say that I have really enjoyed this entire CD.  Nicki is not Lil Kim (whom I really love too).  She has her own unique style & persona.  She raps.  She sings..  Her songs also seem to have a message about standing through opposition,  love, confidence, etc... Its more than talking about the streets.  Some of its kinda inspirational. I really hope that Nicki can outlast the extreme unfair pressure that she is goinhg through in the industry right now becuase she is definitely a gem that hopefully will soon be appreciated.<br />  Women in rap are very few these days.  We need more women to succeed in the game.  We need to have a variety of women to represent.  We need Nicki Minaj.
159562015X|5.0|i finally took the strengths finder test (after hearing about it for years), and read the accompanying book.  the book is really more of a reference to the test, by the way.  but i so deeply resonate with the basic notion that we grow more by developing our strengths than by trying to compensate for our weaknesses.  i'll definitely be using this in my coaching work (and have already assigned it to one of my coaching cohorts).  i can hardly think of a human being who wouldn't benefit from taking this (online) test and learning more about their unique (i'd say god-given) wiring.
B000P0J0EW|2.0|After many years of hearing How great this movie is, I Finally saw it. I was very disappointed; itwas way too long, and had the usual hollywood baggage. In 20 years no 1 ever ages. Only 1 prisoner ever admits their guilt. Anyone with a religious view point Is of course a vicious hypocrite. Robbins's Portrayal is so understated as to border on comatose. The climactic development Is patently ludicrous morgan freeman is great. I feel no great interest in ever seen this movie again. this is not even the best movie I saw this weekend, much less of alltime.
1594484775|4.0|i love hornby's writing.  he doesn't just tell stories, he develops characters.  really, his books are more about the interplay of a collection of well-developed characters than they are about \\"what happens\\".  this collection involves a reclusive american ex-rocker (who has systematically destroyed most of his life), a going-nowhere obsessed fan from england, and that fan's \\"what have i done with my life?\\" newly ex-girlfriend.  as the story unfolds, the ex-girlfriend becomes friends with the ex-rocker.  as with other hornby books, themes of redemption (or, at least, partial redemption) and taking stock of life are central.  the title, by the way, refers to a newly released acoustic version of the rocker's one critically acclaimed record.

0525421580|5.0|I get the feeling that I'm in the minority when I say Will Grayson, Will Grayson is my favourite John Green book. Everyone I've talked to about this seems to the one of his first three is the best. John Green even, arguably, seems to think this as his vlogs in the year coming up to the release of Paper Towns were all about Paper Towns. We barely heard about Will Grayson, Will Grayson until the month of its release.    Unfortunately, this is the only book by David Levithan that I've read, so I guess it's my favourite by default. I do plan to rectify this as soon as I can.    Why is this my favourite John Green book, you ask? Well, there are many reasons. But all in all in comes down to the editing. The editing the authors did to make events and people match up. The editing that made both parts of the book read in completely different ways but still feel as if they were the same book. The editing that made David Levithan's chapters comprehensible. Cause, seriously, thats an astonishing feat in and of itself. Though, not because he is a bad writer or anything. No, no! If anything the style in which he wrote his chapters proves that he is a superior writer. So often authors make these stylistic choices and...well...they just shouldn't have. But after being sure that I'd never get used it in the first even numbered chapter, the rest didn't feel awkward at all.    A style example (I promise you, the punctuation is how it is in the book):        the other will grayson heads off, leaving me with my new refrigerator-size companion, who's looking at me with such sincerity that i want to slap him.        me: you don't have to stay. really      tiny: what, and leave you here to mope?    Will Grayson, Will Grayson is the story of two Wills and how they relate to the people in their lives. They both live suburbs of Chicago and don't know the other one exists. The authors of the book have always described the plot as a big X. The characters start out in their own corners, come together in the middle, and then go their seperate ways again.    This book was funny. It was hilarious. I laughed out loud repeatedly. The humour was frank, realistic, and almost unceasing. Which, as this book deals with some very serious things, is astonishing. The teenagers sounded like teenagers, and they crack jokes and are sarcastic and pretentious and awesome. I can only think of one character that I truly disliked and...well...she does something AWFUL and I just can't forgive her for it.    A passage from chapter one to demonstrate said humour (and some of the pretentiousness):        \\"Well, you have to be back by eleven,\\" and I say, \\"Mom this is a historical event. History doesn't have a curfew,\\" and she says, \\"Back by eleven,\\" and I say, \\"Fine. Jesus,\\" and then she has to go cut cancer out of someone.    The two Will's are so different it is hard to imagine that they would have anything in common or be able to relate to each other at all. John's Will is well-off, has a large annoying friend, and has decided that he is living his life according to two specific rules. 1. Don't care too much. 2. Shut up. Anything that has gone wrong in his life happened because he wasn't following the rules.    David's Will has depression (like...clinically, the disease kind), his main relationship, outside of family, is with a girl whom he despises, and he's never kissed a boy before. He's kissed girls but that isn't what he really wants.    And then there's Tiny Cooper. The common link. He is the annoying large friend. He is the boy who might be a first kiss. He is the loud, obnoxious, hilarious, loving, rope (or whatever) that holds this book, and the characters, together.    There's so much I could say about this book, about PossiblyGayJane, about the Musical(!), about breaking up on a swing-set, about having a special place, about liking someone so much you're willing to be with them when they hate you, liking them so much you're willing to create a whole new person for them. But, I don't really want to spoil anything. I do have to say though, that at its core, this book is a celebration of life and love. And not really romantic love. Sure, it's there for both Wills. But it's really about all kinds of love. Family love, and how much that can withstand. About the love we have for our friends and how there is no right time to tell them we love them, even though they deserve to hear it.    That's why I think I loved this book more than John Green's other books. It is, very simply, about love, in all shapes and sizes.    And, about being FABULOUS.
B0018AOAOI|5.0|I first heard Jane's addiction when I was probably 14 years old.  Oddly enough it was the song True Nature off of Jane's last studio album Strays (2003). It was featured as the opening song for the video game MLB 2005.  My dad actually took more of a liking to them than I did.  Over the years however I looked more into the band, learned about their history and started listening.  And boy when I started listening, I couldn't stop.  Perry Farrell (lead singer) and the band itself have been called the godfathers of Alternative Rock, and rightfully so.  This album along with their others is a true masterpiece of music.  I will say that it takes a few listens to get into it, depending on how it hits you.  But this album is a 5/5 in my book.  Stop! and Been Caught Stealing were the only songs that grabbed my attention at first, but after listening to it more and more I fell in love with the songs Classic Girl and Three Days as well.  All four songs I've mentioned are naturally the singles on the album, lol.      Jane's Addiction blends high pitched vocals with the mainstream sound of grunge'esk and alternative rock stylings to produce some outstanding songs that keep you wanting more and more.  I have no doubt it my mind that had Jane's not had the troubles that caused their departure from the music scene so quickly back in the early 90's.  We could easily be recognizing Jane's Addiction as one of the biggest bands of the past 20 years.  Even greater than Oasis and Red Hot Chili Peppers.  It's so sad to think of all the beautiful songs that could have been but never were.  But none the less, Jane's still produced 3 very solid albums and are still one of my all time favorite bands.
0618001905|5.0|Having served in the Congo in the l960's,I was especially amazed to know that no one  from our missionary service spoke of the genocide and cruelty inflicted on the people of Congo during the previous 80 years under King Leopold II and the Belgian colonizers. It is not a part of history included in world history studies so far as I know.  I recommend this book for all students of history so that this \\"blank\\" period of terror upon Congo is well known.
0385528752|5.0|I purchased this book because I was trying to get out of a funk and felt like I was just spinning my wheels.  Although I am still about 2/3 of the way through this book has already helped me to change my perspective and see some results.  The analogies and strategies in this book are so valuable to anyone who is interested in change for whatever reason.  An instant classic for me and one that I will recommend to others.
0596806027|4.0|I read the first few chapters in detail and just perused the others. Why? Because like most developers I am interested in HTML5 (and CSS 3) and hope they get adopted... but since I'm not sure if and when that is going to happen I figured there was little reason to spend on lot of time on the latter component-specific chapters.    I really enjoyed the author's style - he presents technical material clearly while throwing in enough \\"humanness\\" to make you want to continue reading (as opposed to dozing off). He not only gives us facts, but also the background info behind many of them, which I find aids understanding - especially in this somewhat controversial topic.    The main reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is because I didn't read much of the book thoroughly. But if the latter chapters are as good as the first ones - and I see no reason why they shouldn't be - maybe I'll come back and up the score to 5. (But given the adoption rate of HTML5, that could be awhile ;-)

1878424319|4.0|This book not only briefly describes the static agreements (wrong and unnecessary thoughts and assumptions about ourselves and others)in our mind which had been taught to us but also proves their consequences in real life. Four agreements are for erasing those bad agreements and making new loving agreements which will lead us to happy life. Book is interesting because it is also literally describing this mechanism.
0385342047|2.0|I have read all of Kinsella's books, and I think overall, her best books are the non-Shopaholic ones.  \\"Can You Keep A Secret,\\" and \\"Twenties Girl\\" in particular.    But I've read all of the Shopaholic books, partly because I've been curious to see if Becky will ever straighten up and fly right. I thought maybe once she became a mother, she would. Don't most of us grow out of our juvenile behaviors when we become parents? Not Becky!    The most diappointing parts of the book: When Luke hires a Super Nanny to come around and assess little Minnie Brandon (who, aside from being a brat, is just an accessory; we hardly ever see Becky and Luke actually parenting her, she's foisted off on Becky's parents and neighbors most of the time), the Nanny doesn't think Minnie is REALLY a brat. I'm sorry, but a child who screams \\"MINE\\" about everything, and has been taught by her mother that everything is affordable, is a brat.  However, I was encouraged to see the Nanny properly diagnose Becky with a shopping addiction. \\"Finally,\\" I thought. \\"She'll get help and realize that she's been acting like a two year old.\\"    Nope! Because in the end, Becky has a heart of gold and pulls off an amazing surprise party (for her husband, who ostensibly avoids celebrating his birthday, but apparently loves the party) with the help of Luke's very rich, well-connected, estranged birth mother.  Who never reconciles with Luke.  So Becky's bad behavior throughout the book is forgiven, and Luke is ready to whisk her off to a lovely work/vacation time in Hollywood, so she can avoid going to the shopping addiction seminars she so desperately needs.    At some point, one really wants a flawed character to face up to her failings and shortcomings. Becky never has to.  In real life, she'd be deep in debt and probably on a \\"Hoarders\\" episode, as she fills up her parents' entire house with her shopping finds.      If you want to read about how parenting can change a person for the better, don't read this book. It will simply depress you.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Kingdom of Heaven, The Director's Cut, should be seen by everyone interested in the current conflicts; misunderstandings, and mishaps between the West and Islam.  Finally, we have something about the medieval origins of this conflict presented in an evenhanded way.  This is a completely different and far superior version than the abridged version that was out.  The behind-the-scenes videoclips are fascinating for film buffs like me, as well as for those keenly interested in filmmaking.
0696204800|3.0|I dug this book out of a pile of crafting books recently as I thought that I should finally begin my plan to make a proper quilt. I've made one or two pillows and a small lap quilt, but that's about the extent of my work.     I definitely found inspiration looking at page after page of beautiful quilt blocks in '501 Quilt Blocks', but not much more. While there is a brief instructional section at the back, it is not nearly as clear or detailed as it should be for a beginning quilter, this is definitely one for someone far more advanced than I am.     The projects at the beginning of the book are beautiful and definitely something to aim for once I am a bit more skilled. A better description of how to make the blocks shown in the book would be helpful and is certainly what I would change even for more experienced crafters.
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|I don't have many nerf wars, but I do have a few every year (mainly with my brother-in-laws after holidy meals...).  Getting into modding nerf blasters has made these handful of annual events even more enjoyable (at least for me, as the other guys have yet to learn how to crack a nerf blaster open.  Except after this past thanksgiving, the damage that they recieved may have given them an incentive to mod themselves... we shall see)!  I have found that Night Finders are fantastically easy to mod and can definately lay down the hurt when done properly.  The one-shot-at-a-time gets old, however, so I searched for other blasters to modify.  The Alpha Trooper is one of my all time favorite slam-firing blasters, but modding only yields so-so results due to the reverse-plunger system.  Still good, but not modified Night Finder good.  The Longshot utilizes a plunger system similar to that of the Night Finder, and therefore can yield incredible ranges and projectile speeds when modified (coupled with the 6, 12, 18, or 35 dart capacity offered by any of the clips)!  All-in-all, not bad.  Especially when you find a pallet of Longshots on a holiday sale for $15 a piece!  Needless to say I did pick up a 'few' of them and they may be available for sale on ebay, or craigslist.  I don't know, we'll see.
0439023521|5.0|This book is a MUST READ for people who want adventure, romance, loss, the whole nine yards!! you will not be disappointed at all with this book. it has everything packed into one and the writing is superb. I recommend this book to EVERYBODY! even adults!!!
0756405890|5.0|One word-WOW!!!    This book is without a doubt my favorite book of all time.  This book blows away all other Fantasy genre novels I have ever read.  I have read LOTR, The Drizzt Do'Urden Series, Dragonlance, as well as some of the Wheel of Time series and some of Terry Goodkinds writings.  Needless to say, while all of the above are also great works in thier own right, The Name of the Wind surpasses them all.      The world Rothfuss creates, the descriptions of the use of magic, the epic tales of his \\"Bard\\" days, all put a familiar yet unique twist on a Fantasy novel.  He manages to depict magics \\"workings\\" through modern physics and chemistry in a way that allows the reader to understand HOW magic works and still be very fantasy like.  This is not simply a description such as \\"The mage murmured some ancient tongue and with a flick of his wrist and some quick semantics a beam of blue light emerged from his hand.\\"  This single aspect is by far one of the most intriguing parts of the book in my opinion.    There book has everything, action, thrills, romance, and intrigue, quite simply put, you will not put it down until you are done.  The only complaint I have is that I have to wait until March to read the next volume.      If you want a Fantastic story (regardless of genre) with a well written book, and an author who knows how to hold your attention, BUY THIS BOOK!
B003L77GRO|5.0|Firstly, this is the best show on television, plain and simple. I came to it late, discovering just a little over two years ago, and so I've had to catch up - I completely agree with the many, many reviews on different sites which really go after the quality of the DVDs for \\"Dexter\\", by the way. If you can get Blu, do so. Now, a series about a serial killer didn't quite seem like my kind of trip when I first began watching \\"Dexter\\", but this show quickly pulls you in with excellent acting, writing and directing. (Trivia: Are any of you old enough to remember the geeky guy who lets his haunted car, Christine, take over his life and get even at everybody else, in the Stephen King classic, \\"Christine\\"? That actor, Keith Gordon, is the same man directing this series. Anyhow!) Michael C. Hall is nothing less than superb as the tortured title character, and he continues hitting it out of the ballpark this season, despite having spent the majority of this last year or so sick as a dog and undergoing chemotherapy in real life for leukemia. (His agent says that he's doing well, right now). As we all know from decades of anti-heroes, the audience has to like a killer (Warren Beatty as Clyde Barrow, for instance), or watching this type of show is going to leave you with a - well, weird feeling: I've seen shows, both fictional and biographical, where the 'hero' was so revolting an individual that I couldn't figure out why anybody thought he/she deserved a show, and I had to take a shower after watching the piece of garbage. This series is so well-written that even though we know Dexter is a bad man - he himself constantly describes himself as a 'monster' -, he is redeemed in our eyes by wanting a normal life, by wanting to be a good family man, even - as in this season -, becoming an avenger of sorts to another individual who is as troubled as he is, the gangrape survivor, Lumen. Lumen is portrayed by Julia Stiles, and I did not know her work before this, and she has quickly become a contender in my list of favorites - she plays Lumen with the perfect pitch, and the viewer (SPOILER) truly follows the character as she goes from victim to terrified survivor, to vigilante to trusting Dexter, et al. I found myself conflicted by this specific plotline of the season - Would our 'good' Dexter actually teach somebody else what he knows, and how to kill? It took me a few episodes to realize that yes, Dexter, with his tangled ideals of justice and self-preservation, would think that the right thing to teach a victim would not so much be revenge, but...how to make certain she is never a victim again. I think that this series is truly an example of the \\"What would I do?\\" school, rather than simple slash and trash; non-fans of the show say that we read too much into the series, but there are many, many things to think about when watching it. I suppose the simplest point to make would be that this is a thinking man's series, and it addresses the fact that we may not like having to admit it, but there are people out there who do bad things to other people, for no palpable reason other than to be evil. Then there's Dexter - admittedly, usually more on celluloid than in the real world - promising us that at least a few of those evil people will never get near our kids. In today's Armageddon-round-the-corner way of thinking, Michael C. Hall, therefore, portrays a fascinating character who both intrigues us and frightens us, and - admit it - more than a few of us are hoping that everything will, in some odd draw of the Fate cards, will work out for him. This, then is a successful antihero, and the show should be seen as more than a small screen slasher flick. It is very rough in language, there are plenty of sexual situations, etc., and so remember all that if the blood stuff hasn't been enough of a warning that this is not a show for the kids.

B0046IGOIO|5.0|I would to start by confessing I am not the biggest Doors fan in the world. I have their debut album and the Best of collection and that's about it. I bought this CD on a whim purchase because I saw that it featured Albert King whom I absolutely love. That being said I find this CD to be an incredibly strong live performance by a fine-tuned band. To start with the song selection is top notch with a nice selection of tunes from throughout their catalog at the time. The biggest revelation for me though are the songs with King which are fantastic. Hearing Morrison's growl blast its way through King Bee and Who Do You Love with the fiery yet still somehow subtle playing of King is simply sublime. To those who complain about the album I would say several things, first if you have a problem with the tracks containing silence or tuning delete them when you upload them to your computer or skipped over them when listening. Doing so in no way affects the experience of the show and actually makes it better. To those complaining about the sound, for a show recording from the 70s that was not on a soundboard the sound is fairly good, it drops out in some portions but what can you expect from a 40 year old show? In the end, this is a top-flight performance from a band that had reached the pinnacle of its talents. Highly recommended to all even remotely interested in the Doors.
B000GSA59M|5.0|love it. Exceptional value again from Behringer. Works really well nice clean sounds and very responsive and works very well in my small studio.would have liked on board F/X but works with all my outboard gear and on my iMac
B003R0LBVW|2.0|i put this book down several times to read and finish other books. wonderful literary prose at times but overall dull.  the ending was disappointing to say the least.
0393327655|5.0|It's not easy being agnostic in the US.  People are so unreasonable about any discussion that disagrees with any religion.  For some odd reason there is a dispensation for religion when it comes to argument and question.  When I read this book it solidified everything I had been thinking.  It clarified my questions and gave solid argument to the subject.  I studied history and one of the first things you learn about is period documentation to support your argument.  Since there is no real documentation to support any religion it is amazing to me how everyone just believes without proof.  Thank you Sam Harris for such a thoughtful book.
0316098337|3.0|The literary device used by the author in this book is to tell the story through the viewpoint of a 5-year old boy.  The syntax (\\"I get on Rocker to take a pin from Kit on Shelf\\") and prosaic descriptions (\\"meltedy spoon\\") are exactly apropos to a 5-year old boy (although he seems to be rather precocious, knowing how to add fractions at that age.)  The said literary device works and works well ... for about 30 pages.  Then it gets rather dreary and difficult to read.  In my opinion, the author should have interspersed adult viewpoints (that of the mother) with the child's, or maybe even composed the second half of the book from the viewpoint of the mother.    Regarding the book itself, the story arc is close to the real-life kidnapping and subsequent brutalization of one Elisabeth Fritzl in Austria in 2008.  The difference is that in this story, the kidnapper is not related to the hostage and the duration of the disappearance was 6-7 years only.  However, during those years, the child's mother bore two children, only one --- our narrator --- survived.  They were forced to live in an 11x11 room, with no outside contact except regular and unsettling visits by the kidnapper.  The mother built an entire universe in the room for her son --- the channels on the TV were \\"different planets\\", etc.      Eventually, the mother and child are free from the clutches of their kidnapper and both of them have to learn how to live in a society --- for the kid, this is the first time anyone besides his mother has touched him; for the mother, many things have changed: Google has matured from a curiosity to a necessity, her parents are divorced, etc.  Good material to present from an adult's viewpoint.    All this is rather poignant, however, the ending of the story was unsatisfactory; no further information was provided on why the child's mother was kidnapped? by who?  Why did the child's mother attempt to commit suicide, especially after being so strong for her son?  The travails feltby mother and child as they adjusted to their new surroundings, etc.  In sum, it is a book that captivates the reader and it most certainly deserved to be read to the end.  The journey to reach the end does become laborious in part.
0671042734|4.0|I'm an avid reader, but somehow had managed to never pick up any Le Carre. Once I heard that a newer movie with some of my favorite actors (Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth) was being made of it, I knew I had to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did! I'm only a quarter of the way through, but already I really like it. The set up is classic spy novel and is still somehow relevant, decades later. Can't wait to get to the rest, and maybe move on the the following two.
B00292V3PS|5.0|Hey...if you don't \\"get\\" how great this show is..then I don't know what can interest you.  The first 4 minutes of this episode just grip you...Tess is evil...Clark is faced with a moral dilemma and there's a chase thru a dark forest...all within the first 4 minutes of the show.  This is what great storytelling is all about. Oh...and BTW...Tom Welling directed this episode.  What talent! I love Smallville!
0525951652|1.0|Just bad. Really, really bad. Other reviewers have hit on the main problems--too many ridiculous coincidences. It's a shame since the story IS set at such an interesting time in history. Save your time and money.
B0029Z2714|5.0|\\"Clark Kent is dead.  Goodbye Chloe.\\"  Wow...this was a powerful episode/finale.  I so love this mature, sometimes dark, Clark Kent.  Someone said he's too serious, but the portrayal is that of someone trying to come to grips with saving people's lives...and he takes this very seriously.  Perhaps it's not in keeping with the Superman comic in that it isn't light-hearted all the time...but this series has so much drama...how can you not love it.  It allows us to feel every kind of emotion possible...and all of this in a single episode.  It's genius how they are able to deal with so many characters and tie them all together in a coherent way.  Thanks for another great episode.  edited 9 Feb 2011:  Just saw this again and that final scene is one of my favorites of the series. Tom Welling does a great job portraying a Clark Kent that has turned away from believing in humanity...or rather in his own humanity.  That final scene never stops moving me in the loss of hope portrayed by Chloe and Clark.  I love this series....
B003NFM3JU|1.0|This movies was not made to promote Christmas but to destroy it... Yes its got cool special effects and it has a good message at the end, but its the hidden message in the middle that everyone needs to be aware of... The second ghost is a sick representation of santa/jesus figure who looks and acts kind of evil/demented drunk Guy \\"and if you dont think so just look at the beard, his hair, HIS CROWN OF THORNS & the Religious music playing in the background... But this jesus/santa figure dies a sudden and disturbing death... Since when does the second ghost die in the original story and why would this Movie make such a horrible evil looking second ghost that mocks christmas or Jesus... Oh unless if its written and produced by a Zionist/Talumdic Jew... I guess I answered my own question... Please Christians Wake Up and stay away from evil movies like this that are out to destroy what's left of Christmas... Nick    PS: I am not mocking disney \\"Walt Disney was a christian\\" but not today its run my Talmudic Jews like most of hollywood...
B00428CPUY|5.0|I own all the Crossroads DVD's and this one is top notch. I was a little concerned with Steve Winwood and Clapton performing the same songs as last year but that fear faded quickly as they delivered stellar performances. The double guitar solo on Had to Cry Today is excellent showing them working together in top form.  The entire show is great and deserves a place in just about any music collection. Eric's playing is exceptional on everything.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I got a good price for this movie, I checked at stores so I'm pleased with my purchase and doubly so because I got both SATC movies for what one store was charging for SATC 2. I didn't get to see it in the movie theater because I gave birth while the movie was released. A must for any SATC junkie.
B000068FWC|5.0|The cd was excellent. A bit shorter than I expected, but it is the digital copy of the old record, so it makes sense. The music quality was excellent, and this is an overall great cd from Supertramp. I recommend it to everyone that enjoys classic rock.
B002R4K6AG|5.0|Bob Dylan and Christmas.. Are there two things that could possibly make me happier?<br /><br />This album will bring me great joy and more than likely bring my family great pain all through the holiday season!
B0041KOVUU|4.0|I gave this ep a four star rating simply because its really rare for anyone to put out anything that deserves a five star rating. Anything rated that high should be considered a masterpiece that'll stand the test of time so in my opinion this new Teargarden release can't be called a masterpiece honestly. That being said, its still a very solid piece of work by Corgan. The packaging is impressive and much better then the first ep that came out a few months prior. The box is much bigger then I expected but its really eye catching and the vinyl record inside is really nice too. Many people complained about the quality of the vinyl record in the first ep but this one is far superior in comparison to that one. As far as the songs are concerned, they are all very solid and hold their own. Like the first ep, I don't think there is a song off this one that'll be some smash #1 hit or anything but the songs are better this go around. Tom Tom is by far the best song off this one though and I feel its the one that really carries the ep. Its nice to see the Pumpkins are slowly gaining momentum not just here in the States but all around the world. Their shows are getting good reviews and the music is getting better with each new release. This is only the 2nd of 11 ep's so I believe the best is still yet to come but this will for sure hold me until the next release. If you're a fan then buy it now, you'll enjoy the music and the packaging. If you're not then don't and just listen to the free releases over the internet. Thats whats so great about this new release method, everyone has an opportunity to hear it and hopefully everyone is taking advantage of it.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|[[ASIN:B003VS0CX8 The Sound of Music (45th Anniversary Edition) (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]]There's not much I can add to the positive comments previous reviewers have said of the Blu-ray edition of TSOM.  The only thing I can say is that the producers of this reissue left no stone unturned when it came to providing as much information and extras as possible about the film's background, production, and legacy.  If the producers found anything open to question, those issues were solved, and any issues about lack of quality were fully addressed.  Thankfully, whatever naysayers there are, nearly all their complaints were either due to lack of understanding about the equipment they have to view the movie on, or how to work the interactive programs contained on the first two disks.  And the reissue producers came up with the novel addition of a regular DVD edition to keep the kids entertained on a trip so that they won't have to continually ask Mom and Dad, \\"Are we there yet?\\"    This film will outlive all of us alive today, and continue its glorious story for generations to come.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was looking to upgrade a very old camera bag and compared all the professional models. I wasn't interested in the biggest or in hauling every single accessory I could pack in there. I have plenty of room for two cameras and an extra lens, with space left over. If you want to carry every single thing you own, don't buy this. There are fancier and more complex models out there. If you want simplicity and an easy carry bag, this is does it. Check the prices and you will be back like me.
B003JTHESA|5.0|What need be said???  I do not know how this album could be better.  Three months later, I'm STILL hearing things I didn't notice before.  Only Maiden can achieve this.  FIVE stars is not enough for this masterpiece.
B004DC2WF2|5.0|I am a huge fan of the graphic novel, so when I first heard this series was being produced, I was understandably stoked about it. Thus, I was rather disappointed when I first started watching the series and saw how many...artistic liberties and creative discretion was taken by the show's producers in writing the series.    Strangely enough, that disappointment did not last very long as I saw each episode, the changes still kept within the realm of plausibility while also keeping the tension and drama that characterized the comic book original.    Certainly, I have gripes with many of the changes. Andrea's age, for instance, was certainly an uncomfortable point for me when I saw how drastic the character was changed. The nature of the zombies too, disheartened me to a certain extent. I was expecting the slow, shambling, ambling zombies generally mindless and working on a pack mentality. So when I saw the series zombies were the aggressive, highly functional zombies, I was rather uneasy with how the series would end up.     Nevertheless, despite the misgivings I have for the changes made between the series and the comic itself, I can say that this show has been worth every penny I've shelled out so far to watch it. The acting is sufficient to sustain the tension and drama, and for the purposes of a tv show, that should be enough. The focus, therefore, is on the plot, and that is well written, well paced, and in general, true to the nature of the source material.    Excellent work AMC.
0634060384|5.0|This is an unusual book to review. My 5-star rating can't be taken as a recommendation as it might for a piece of fiction or a revealing biog or penetrating political commentary. In fact, it's not a book at all. It's a working manual for jazz musicians. As such it is invaluable. Just grateful it was available through amazon.com
0439023513|3.0|This book didn't measure up to the first two books which I couldn't put down, especially the first one that knocked me off my seat. This book actually bored me, The idea, the only thing somewhat interesting is the beginning where Peeta is taken by Snow. I did love the little love triangle Katniss had but it wasn't very in depth, she led both of them on, I felt myself skimming pages because I was getting bored. I loved the character of Katniss but as one of the other reviews say, how can she ever be happy again with all that death? I am happy she ended up with Peeta, he loved her all along.
0684843749|5.0|The book was in good condition, but the timeliness was unbelievable.  They most have sent it out the day I ordered it, since the turn around was very shocking.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Over 6 hours of entertainment. Optional beginning and extra scenes throughout movie. Glad I bought this and gave the original single disk to my adult son and his family. Might be my imagination, but this seems to be at a higher definition than before.  Great packaging too.
B00168OINK|4.0|I love this movie. It's not perfect, but it's darn good. It's sort of an animated Karate Kid, set in ancient China (or some version of it) and starring animals...and the main character is a fat panda. Ok, so Karate Kid might be a stretch on the face of it. But it's that type of story.<br /><br />* spoilers *<br /><br />Po is a fat panda who dreams of being a great Kung Fu fighter. Instead, he's a food-aholic who has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. To top it off, he doesn't have the razor sharp claws and teeth that Tigress has, or the wings of Crane, or any of the other top fighters' abilities. Fate intervenes, however, when he is chosen as the Dragon Warrior who must protect the Valley of Peace from an escaped evil doer/super fighter. And, of course, he does it.<br /><br />* end spoilers *<br /><br />The first 30 or so minutes of the movie are not as good as the rest, I think. They rely more on \\"fat humor\\" (Po) and so-so jokes. Not that any of the first half hour is bad...just that, all of it combined, is a little too cheesy. There aren't really any witty jokes or clever bits to accompany the rest...if there was, this would be a lot better.<br /><br />However, once the story picks up, it is very good. The fat humor is still used, but its more important to the story, so quite funny; and the cheesy jokes sort of disappear, which is also good.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really good movie. Not quite 5/5 stars because of the first half hour, but a solid 4/5.
B000I5X81K|5.0|At first, I found this album very challenging in light of his first two, but it has really grown on me, now that I've listened to it several dozen times.<br /><br />This is the album where it becomes clear that Josh Groban is totally unclassifiable in musical genre.  This is the album where it becomes clear that he is a genius, that he produces sounds that no one else has ever come up with, that he is a  paradigm shifter, that he is unpredictable -- that his genius makes him easily bored, that he must be constantly moving to something new in order to be happy -- and we who follow him, therefore, need never fear being bored, as nothing he does is ever quite the same as before even in a concert series.  His very voice shifts unpredictably through different singing styles, sometimes even in the same syllable.<br /><br />The only common element here is that the songs are slow and his voice is powerful and beautiful -- except for some of the falsetto, which does not always sound as good to me as the falsetto on his earlier albums.<br /><br />Individual songs:<br /><br />Mai: This song is more of Josh's traditional almost operatic classical/pop crossover style.  It ends on the most equisite high falsetto note.  Lyrics in Italian.<br /><br />You are loved:  This is Josh's attempt at cheering up depressed people, especially depressed female fans.  There's a music video for it out there showing depressed women being transformed to smiling women.  It's not my favorite one of his songs.  I find the video a bit offensive in that men seem to think that women exist only for the purpose of smiling at men, that it's not acceptable for us to have negative mood.  I don't think the falsetto works here.  It sounds awkward and strained.  Still, Josh is trying very hard to care, to help, to uplift, and that shows his essential sweetness<br /><br />Un Dia Llegara: I *love* this one.  Beautiful guitar.  Again the signature classical/pop crossover.  Lyrics in Spanish.<br /><br />February Song:  This is one that Josh wrote or helped write.  From a musical perspective, it's fascinating.  He's just so innovative with it!  It has an unusual melody, with unexpected intervals, and intriguing use of falsetto.  I would call the genre of this one \\"new\\" music, not classical, pop, or folk.  He plays the piano and sings together on this one.  I like that, because he clearly prefers to do that, and I think that this mode of performance really shows his inner soul.  From a personal perspective, I wonder if it's his song about getting past January, his ex-girlfriend.<br /><br />Ultima Notte: Another of his signature classical/pop crossover songs.  Very pleasant to listen to.  Lyrics in Italian.<br /><br />So She Dances: A very moving, romantic, sweet pop song.<br /><br />In Her Eyes:  I love this one.  It's got a bit of a beat, clearly a pop song.  The lyrics are very insightful, human.<br /><br />Solo Por Ti:  Another of his signature classical/pop crossover songs.  Pleasant, lyrical.  In Italian.<br /><br />Now or Never:  This collaboration with Imogen Heap is an earth-shaking masterpiece.  I can't say as I like the subject, which is why he wants to dump a girlfriend -- not very romantic -- BUT the music is extraordinary.  The sound is unlike anything I've ever heard before -- exotic, sort of electronic, an eerie unpredictable melody -- totally out-of-the-box.  The poetry is fabulous.  The whole thing is just riveting.  If you have not heard this song, please stop everything and go over to YouTube and listen to it.  It will bend your mind.  A very raw, vivid bedroom scene -- albeit only in audio.<br /><br />Un Giorno Por Noi: An Italian version of the movie song from Scorsese's Romeo and Juliet.  Powerful, romantic, sweet.<br /><br />Lullabye: One of Josh's originals, performed with Ladysmith Black Mambaso it's musically interesting.  Josh wrote this after he had visited South Africa and met a lot of kids there, whom he became attached to, and whom he was sad to leave.  It arose out of some very deep personal emotions for him.  Unfortunately, it does not really convey the depth of what he was feeling as much as he might have wished.  Listen to the music and don't pay too much attention to the lyrics.<br /><br />Weeping: Sudden paradigm shift -- think Pete Seeger. This song from South Africa was written as political commentary about Apartheid, but has social relevance to many other contexts, about fear and opression.  Perhaps one thought of Josh as a very conservative young man who likes to sing Christian and near classical songs.  Perhaps one did not think of him as suddenly becoming Pete Seeger -- but you must remember that Josh is a genius.  He is highly creative, easily bored, and never likes to stay in the same place for long.  Expect the unexpected with him.<br /><br />Machine: Co-written by Josh.  This song could perhaps be described as a light rock/jazz/electronic crossover, rather than classical/pop crossover.  Like most of Josh's songs, it's slow, but it has a much more definite and danceable beat than the others -- totally different from anything else Josh has done, but again remember that he's easliy bored and constantly moving.  I confess to feeling slightly defensive when Josh sings accusingly \\"You're a Machine.\\"  Makes me want to poke him and say \\"I am not.\\"  It's one of those rare instances where he starts to sound like an angry, young man, the way so many rock/metal singers sound (though much more subdued).  Still it's catchy in its own way and you want to bop around a bit while listening.<br /><br />----------------<br />Addendum:  In a recent interview, Josh said that February Song is probably his favorite of the songs he has written.  It is certainly a very beautiful song musically.  Apparently, it is a song to himself, a song encouraging him to bounce back from adversity.eling as much as he might have wished.

B004CA2HVE|4.0|The album is awesome. The movie is awesome. The problem with this particular item is the album cover and the \\"digital booklet\\" are both censored, despite the clearly labeled [explicit] note in the product title.

B002ZG98Z0|2.0|I enjoyed the first portion of the movie while the girls were in NYC.  The wedding between Anthony and Stanford was amazing! The movie started to go downhill when the girls left their 5th character (NYC) behind to head to the desert. That portion of the film started out ok, but quickly turned into one weird scene after another.  It was almost like the writer didn't know how to end the movie so he quickly wrapped it up by having the girls get kicked out of their hotel.  It was just strange. Unfortunately I purchased this movie and will probably never watch it again!
B003L77GH4|5.0|It took only two days to watch the whole complete season one! And what a clifhanger in the end! I read the books but this is way better... who could resist Damon's darkness, Stefan's modesty or the beaty of Elena? I couldn't, that's for sure. Every hour was better than the previous one and I just couldn't stop watching. First, I was a bit annoyed that the Tv-version is so different than the book. But as I watched more and got deeper into it, it didn't matter at all. If you like stuff like this... you must buy this one! I've already pre-ordered the season two and hope to get it in my mailbox as soon as possible!
0142437611|4.0|In the December 2003 issue of \\"The Atlantic Monthly\\", Martin Amis wrote a rave review of Saul Bellow.  Among the encomiums:<br /><br />\\"Bellow sees more than we see--sees, hears, smells, tastes, touches.  Compared with him, the rest of us are only fitfully sentient; and intellectually, too, his sentences simply weigh more than anybody else's. * * * I hereby trumpet the prediction that Saul Bellow will emerge as the supreme American novelist.\\"<br /><br />I have now read two of Bellow's novels and I confess that I don't understand such extravagant praise by Amis and many others.  Despite the prolixity of \\"The Adventures of Augie March\\", I ended up enamored with it (though not so much so that it made my personal list of  \\"Top 10 American Novels\\").  What saved \\"Augie March\\" for me, endeared it to me, was its energy, ebullience, enthusiasm.  It was life-affirming.  I would have thought that a novel with the title \\"Seize the Day\\" would also be life-affirming.  At the risk of being overly simplistic, the title now strikes me as ironic.  And the novel itself, as well-crafted as it is as a literary artifact, was somewhat of a disappointment.<br /><br />Tommy Wilhelm, age 45, is an irresolute loser.  Dissatisfied with college, he succumbed to the blandishments of a phony talent scout to seek his fortune in Hollywood.  Dissatisfied with his name, he changed it from Wilhelm Adler to Tommy Wilhelm.  Dissatisfied with his marriage, he left his wife and two sons.  Dissatisfied with his sales job with the Rojax Corporation, he quit that in a huff.  He now is living in the Gloriana Hotel on the Upper West Side, he has invested his last $700 in the commodities market (lard and December rye) at the urging of the glib but shady Dr. Tamkin, his estranged wife is hounding him for money, and he is forced to ask his 80-year-old father to cover his bill at the Gloriana.  He is a bitter disappointment to his father, to his wife, and most of all to himself.<br /><br />The title is voiced by Tamkin, as he tries to cheer up Wilhelm: \\"The past is no good to us.  The future is full of anxiety.  Only the present is real--the here-and-now.  Seize the day.\\"  But Wilhelm is irredeemably weighted down with the past and his history of poor decisions.  And Tamkin is a charlatan.  Perhaps it had more ironical force in the blithe and un-self-conscious Fifties (it was published in 1956), but today SEIZE THE DAY strikes me as a grim and dreary - and less than great - novel.Wilhelm: \\"The past is no good to us.

B0007PALZ2|1.0|I'm a big movie nut.  In this day's high-definition image and sound, quality makes a difference.  But, I'm not overly concerned about quality.  I give wide margins, especially for movies that were made before this recent HD movement.<br /><br />Except that this version of 12 Monkeys so lacks quality, that it actually inhibited my enjoyment of the movie.  I remember seeing this movie in the mid-90s, and really liking it.  It immediately went on my top 100 movie list.  But, after seeing this version of it, it has dropped off my top 100 list.<br /><br />The low quality video and audio is so bad as to make you believe that the movie is more from 1975, rather than 1995.  It makes the whole movie look like some made-for-TV movie, instead of a major motion picture that had critical acclaim when it was released.<br /><br />Buy the movie, but just not this version.  Very disappointed.

B00000DSEK|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne entered his second decade as a solo artist and third overall with an undisputed triumph and the multi-platinum selling `No More Tears'.  I don't think he's made a better record after the two Randy Rhoads classics than this absolute barnstormed that proved at least temporarily that there was still a market for traditional heavy metal during the grunge era.  Without the ridiculously heavy guitar riffing courtesy of Zakk Wylde the record might have been seen as just another hair metal record by an aging artist but Wylde puts those thoughts to shame here. Not that there aren't melodic tunes of the power ballad variety here and they are some of the best that the genre has to offer - \\"Mama\\", \\"Road to Nowhere\\" and \\"Time After Time\\" - all featuring autobiographic lyrics with melancholy and a certain road weariness that suits Ozzy perfectly. The title track is a behemoth, a true epic not seen since the days of `Diary of a Madman'. It's a track that builds and climaxes and then builds again and it could easily be one of the greatest songs from this era.  \\"I Don't Wanna Change the World\\" and \\"Mr. Tinkertrain\\" are classic metal stompers and righteously kick the album off in a flurry of metal insanity.  There are as many moods here as songs and `No More Tears' could also be the Oz's most diverse album as well. Whether or not his work over the last twenty years or so has been consistent or overshadowed by the TV show or Sharon's celebrity there is no denying that with the proper cohorts (including Lemmy and future Alice In Chains bassist Mike Inez) Ozzy can make heavy metal of the highest caliber..

B002WJI63A|3.0|My Granddaughter put this on her wish list so I bought it for her birthday.  I didn't notice the 8\\" size in the description or I wouldn't have bought it.  It was very pricey for such a tiny plush doll.  She looked disappointed when she opened it.  She didn't choose it as a collectible - she chose it because she loves her Mario DS games.  Buyer beware of size.  The doll itself, though, is quite well-made.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm in my early 30s and have about 15-20 lbs I'd like to lose. Last year, I bought this DVD and found that not only was it making a difference in kickstarting my weight loss, but it also was making me a stronger runner. I could feel muscle developing, and I could see a difference in my endurance. Not only that, but when regularly using this video in combination with my regular running routine and diet, I have seen a 1-2 lbs loss per week. I did it last year, and now I'm doing it again.   You will feel the burn and you will be sweating after this workout. If not, you're either not doing it right or you are in too good of shape to even need this. In my case, I modify some of the workouts to suit my needs. I do the modified version of the pushups, and I cheat and pause the DVD to chug some water and catch my breath. I skip the 2 min intro. I also use just one weight with both hands on the side lunges with weights activity because my weights feel too heavy to do one with each hand. Like other reviewers, I do feel like the workouts can be a little tough on my knees.  The more you do it, the more annoying Jillian's chatter through the DVD gets, but I keep it on a low volume and just follow the DVD for pacing. Friends and coworkers who noticed the difference also went out and got the DVD as well. If you want to lose 2 lbs a week, get this DVD and stick to it. It's less than 30 min out of your day and you can do it right in your own home. You just need a mat and some weights and the energy and commitment to get through it. You can stick to Level One forever if you want, or you could do it just a few times a week, but it'll make a difference if you do it right while eating healthy.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|NOTE: This is not a review of the movie. I liked the movie a lot.    Apparently the Digital Copy codes for this three disc set have expired either on Nov. 17, 2010, or Nov. 24, 2010!! If you are interested in a Digital Copy for use on your iPod device you are out of luck!    I purchased this set when Amazon blew it out the other week for nine-ninety-nine. There was no mention that the product was not as advertised (with Digital Copy). The code I received from the initial Shipment caused iTunes to display a message that it had already been used. [The product arrived fully sealed, both in shrinkwrap and with the protection sticker over the top of the jewelcase intact).] I contacted Paramount Support at the URL listed and went back and forth with them THREE MORE TIMES, continually getting codes that iTunes would error on and say \\"The offer associated with that song code has expired.\\" Amazon will allow me to return the product, but claims to be unaware of the problems. I did a Google search, and it turns out Paramount and the company that they used to handle the Digital Copy stuff codes known about this issue for over a year:  [...]    So Amazon blew these things out KNOWING they were about to expire, but never (and still haven't) updated the Product Description. So buyer beware! This product should now be considered Blu-ray only.
159448385X|5.0|This is a great book. Not as good as his first book (Kite Runner) but still a great book. It would be great for a book club or just to read for fun. It does take a few chapters to get into the book but once you are there it is a wonderful adventure and realy sheds light on life in that part of the world.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I cannot even say how many times I have watched this movie. I'm a huge fan of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". I have read the book and seen the BBC version. However, this version is so fresh and so romantic. Colins Firth and Jennifer Ehle were awesome in the previous version, but I have to say Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen did an amazing job. Moreover, the chemistry and the passion between the two actors really catch the audience's attention  I love it. It is my favorite movie of all times!!!!
0811876373|5.0|This book about cake pops is very well written with super easy-to-follow directions for making cake pops.  There are beautiful photos of each cake pop design as well.  The book is sturdy, attractive and worth every penny of the $20.

B004498KPU|5.0|I was extremely pleased with both the video and sound quality of Michael Jackson's Vision.  I feel that Sony did me proud by releasing this collection - Thank you!    The only complaints I have is for Blood on the Dancefloor - I was disappointed the Refugee Remix was used and not the original video.  Also, I was hoping that they would have included 2300 Jackson Street (since they included other videos from the Jacksons).      Aside from that, I was very pleased with the collection and look forward to see what else there is coming out in the future!
031603438X|3.0|Ghost written well, the story has some touching moments.  This rendering from the most sympathetic source still paints a portrait of narcissism   and irresponsibility of epic proportion. I am still wondering how Mick Jagger put up with any of it.  Fates cruelest joke is on his family especially his children who were subjected to the selfish indifference of a man who served himself first, foremost and all the time. He has a basket of handy excuses but for the most part he comes across as someone better left alone to ponder his mortality and abundant failure as a human.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|What can I say in 5000 words or less?  The Sound of Music, the Blu-ray format, the superb sound, the two-disc combo, and it goes on and on.  For anyone who desires a 45-year trip back into movie history, this is the DVD for them.  I toured Salzburg in 1986, and at the time I only took still photographs of my journey through the streets and climbs on the mountains.  With the 45th Anniversary Edition of The Sound of Music, the hills were alive for me once again, and the special features included with the disc combo, provided a special video memory for me to keep as well.  And the bonus DVD can be shared with friends and family who do not have the Blu-ray technology.
B002ZBT84G|3.0|Gil still has a great voice. I get the impression that the producer tried to capitalize on Gil's name and not the message that so many of his fans lone for.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was by far the most interesting and exciting of the Hunger Games Trilogy.   I am surprised at the reviews that complained that it was different than the first two books.   Why would we want to go back to the games for the third time?  The story needed to move on and it did so perfectly.   No need to go into the plot, but I was hooked from first page to last.

B002U0KHMY|4.0|I wanted to start watching a new series to get hooked on and one of my friends told me about white collar.  Even though it took awhile for me to get into this season I think just because they always have to introduce the characters first and their story, this season was very good and twisted.  I would totally recommend it.  I can't wait to start watching season two which my friend told me is even better.     Information on the White Collar Series (DVD) Box Set (below):     In this clever and thrilling new TV series, charming con man Neal Caffrey (Matthew Bomer), escapes from a maximum-security prison, only to be recaptured by his nemesis, FBI Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay). With few options, Caffrey agrees to help the bureau bring down other elusive criminals in exchange for his eventual freedom. But before long, Caffrey finds himself playing a game of cat and mouse with those who want him back in prison or dead. Co-starring Tiffani Thiessen (Beverly Hills, 90210), White Collar is sewn with surprising twists, engaging characters and riveting excitement.    Disc 1 Includes Episodes:  Pilot   Threads   Book of Hours    Disc 2 Includes Episodes:  Flip of the Coin   The Portrait   All In   Free Fall    Disc 3 Includes Episodes:  Hard Sell   Bad Judgement   Vital Signs   Home Invasion    Disc 4 Includes Episodes:   Bottlenecked   Front Man   Out of the Box    Bonus Features Include:  Episode Commentaries   Gag Reel   Deleted Scenes   Featurettes: Pro and Con, A Cool Cat in the Hat, and Nothing But the Truth   Wonderland Commentary with Executive Producer Michael Rauch and Series

1594488878|2.0|I don't understand the rave reviews for this book. It was not interesting or compelling to me at all even though it was easy to read and I got through all of it somehow (hence the 2 stars)  I do agree with the \\"simplistic and corny\\" comment from the NYer ... not sure I really agree with the rich drawing of the characters in this case.
0345505387|1.0|This is the very last time I will ask for a book for my birthday.  I received this as a gift and quite frankly if I wanted a comic book I would have asked for one.  Very very disappointed.
0312323867|4.0|If you're buying this book I would assume you have already read \\"something new\\".  If so, this book is not a let down.  I was a little skeptical as to what else they could do with the characters that would not make this trite or boring but I came to realize that there's a whole new side to the characters I came to love in the first book.  In short - if you liked \\"something borrowed\\" you will like \\"something blue.\\"
B003FVI2KQ|4.0|If you're on a budget get one of these, its no core i7 980X, but it can hold its own, and it runs very very cool, very good for multitasking, Over-clocking this baby is a walk in the park once you have a good mobo.

B0044KU7KU|5.0|After my first listen, I was a bit weirded out - this was not the My Chem from Black Parade, Three Cheers..., or I Brought You My Bullets...  But it didn't take more than half another round for it to completely grow on me.  After all, there wasn't much that tied their previous three together either, except that while completely different, they were each just as truly and exuberantly identifiable as My Chem.  This one is their best - sounds trite, but this is pure rock and roll bombast, completely earnest and without a single drop of irony.  And that's refreshing.
6305882592|5.0|So much has ben written about Harold and Maude, thus I will only add this bit: it is, and has been, my favorite movie for over 30 years.

0596805888|5.0|Cooking for Geeks: Real Science, Great Hacks, and Good Food by Jeff Potter is not your average cook book. There are many great recipe's covering everything from a Chocolate Port Cake to Duck Confit Sugo. What is unique about this book is the scientific reasons why things do what they do when you cook or mix them together, all written in a fun and informative style.    I have been cooking for years and I learned a lot from this great book. One of the subjects was on smell and taste. I've never heard of \\"supertasters\\" before. I now know what they are and how to determine if I am one (I'm not but my daughter is). This explains about people's many different reactions to taste, especially if you have picky eaters at home.    Despite all the experiments with chemicals, dry ice and blow torches (which appeals to some), the recipe's and information in this book run from simple to complex. You will learn how to calibrate your oven using sugar, the best kitchen utensils to have, how to cook using sous vide (under vacuum) and so much more. I would recommend this book as a staple in anyone's kitchen. It might even get those whoes idea of cooking is to put a frozen pizza in the oven, to actually try some recipes, even if it's just for the fun experiments. For those who do everything by laptop, the e-book version would be a great addition to your collection too. Just make sure you have a splash guard on that keyboard!

B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I never watched any of the series or the 1st movie. I happen to be in NYC during opening night with a visiting Aussie who is a big fan of the show. We went to the theater where they filmed some of the scenes.      I really enjoyed the movie. It was fun, colorful, light and did I mention fun?.. The whole audience lapped it up, laughing many times and I did not see any down faces coming out.      I did watch the 1st movie a week later and omg I hated it. Talk about serious boring drama. Don't mind drama, but on dvd at home when I am in the mood.      I am surprised by the low reviews this movie got. Maybe I enjoyed it more because I went with an open mind with no pre-conception of the series.  For me, it was fun, I laughed and I was in a great place/time to see the movie.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a classic, campy movie that is even better in Blu-ray format.  If you're a fan, you will enjoy the Blu-ray version.  If you haven't discovered Rocky yet, get this version for the best picture and sound.
B0049D1TCM|1.0|This album is horrible....I like her but this is pure and utter disrespect to my ears!!! There are only a few tracks worth my time listening, buy Rihanna's album if you must spend your money!
B0044XV3QY|2.0|This of course is a great movie, which I've seen dozens of times.  However, the packaging though eye-catching is poor.  All three discs managed to get scratched being that it's placed on cardboard pullout on their poorly designed package.  Be wary buying this version because I also know quite a few people who also experienced scratched discs due to the poor packaging.
0743298039|5.0|This one goes in my top five of all time. The story kept me turning page after page and if I wasn't able to be reading it, I was dying to get back to it. Thought I had it figured out halfway through but didn't and the outcome was a cool twist. Keeping this one so I can read it again!
048622709X|5.0|George Bridgman was arguably the finest anatomy teacher at the Art Students' League in NYC, and taught some of the greatest American artists of the last century.  This book is a collection of sketches and lectures from his other writings, devoted to the structure of the hand.  Unlike a straightforward anatomy book, Bridgman breaks down the hand, providing visual cues for artists to gain understanding as they draw from life.  This is not a visual reference for those looking for a swipe file of hand gestures and anatomical references (hint:  You already have two of those at the end of your wrists), but an explanation of how to construct the hand and how the structures of each part make up the whole.  If you use it as a guide to enhance your life drawings, you will learn a great deal and improve your understanding of the human hand's construction.  If you use this book solely as a shortcut and swipe file, you will get some useful techniques, but will ultimately be disappointed.
B0043HA1K0|4.0|Haven't heard it all but enjoying it very much.<br /><br />Its different because its Jazzy. Not tradition Roots or John Legend so if thats what your looking for then dont look here. It is Very Good but it is not like anything you are used to with these individuals.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|I expected higher packaging quality for a Beatles box set. At times I feel its a pirate copy, since all the pics in the booklets and Cd cases are not well printed (very blury..)as if it isn't the original version. The disc cases are not even digipacks. And in most you could see they are not well made and the glue used is not too good, as some of them are coming apart. The box itself as somehow broken at arrival.  In fact the quality of the product is not good at alla. Of course the music is from the Beatles, but I want to compare the sound with another remasterd version to check if this is the real thing.  Dissaponted with this purchase!
0393307050|3.0|No need to review the book, I have read them all but had missed the first one. Note that the cover pictured is the original, first Norton edition but what you receive is the later edition. Not the collector's edition.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I didn't watch this show when it first aired, but I heard good things from friends.  There was a sale one day on Amazon and I got this series for a good price and figured, \\"Why not?\\"  I am sure glad I bought it because it is a great show.  Very well shot with beautiful costumes and scenery.  Very engaging show -ended up watching the Blu-Rays back to back one long weekend.  If you are new to this show and are on the fence with whether to purchase it, I strongly recommend it.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I left the movie, came home and immediately ordered the CD.  I've been playing it on repeat and love it!! Instant high without any downside : ) For those who care I'm 50. I knew a couple of Christiana's songs but could be called a fan.  I thought she was OUTSTANDING in the movie and on the soundtrack. Cher? Well there's a reason she's known worldwide by her first name only. She's in a class all her own and and inspiration to young and old alike!!!
0553805371|5.0|If you're interested in quantum physics, philosophy, Stephen Hawking, or the mysteries of the universe, buy this book. This was a fascinating read, and Hawking does a good job of explaining complicated theories and concepts. I do not have a science background, although I am very interested in science, and most of it was understandable. For the things that were not, I was sufficiently intrigued to want to read it again! The book isn't too long and is fairly succinct. It is also infused with humor, and definitely lives up to its title. I would highly recommend it.
0553269631|5.0|It's a bit sad overall, but it gives you something to think about. Have a glass of wine and watch reruns of \\"Friends\\" when you are done.
0061537969|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a dog-loving friend.  I was unsure that I would enjoy, or even understand, a book that focused on car racing, but it was so much more and one of those rare books that I couldn't put down.  I found myself staying up into the wee hours not willing to put it down.  I rooted for the main character and, of course, fell in love with the dog Enzo.  I thought this book flowed beautifully and was written with such care.  I'll definitely be watching for more books from Garth Stein.
B004498KPU|4.0|I bought this as a gift for someone and he just loves it. It was only $20 bucks at Borders (50% off Holiday deal) and I figured for a 3 disc Michael Jackson video anthology, you can't beat that. I was hoping for some type of special behind-the-scenes footage but maybe they'll milk fans for that over time. I thought it was a good buy and the sound is pretty good. The video is still a bit old on some. Overall, I was impressed. =)
B001UV4XUG|5.0|The 28th of December 2009 was the day I discovered \\"(500) Days Of Summer\\". A friend and I were trying to get tickets for \\"Avatar\\" but there were only sold out shows...so we ended up watching this little movie which I had heard nothing about...the movie began after the trailers and the \\"Fox Searchlight\\" logo played, and as anyone who has seen the film already knows \\"The Author's Note\\" appeared on screen...and it was from this point on that I knew I was about to experience a completely different type of movie...A story of girl meets boy...but not a love story. I have since seen the film 4 times and have grown to really appreciate the structure, entertainment value and the narrative, which is not linear and jumps around, but it holds a sense of dreamlike \\"reality\\" as the film is really just a collection of Tom Hanson's (the main character) recollection of a one sided relationship....and the non-linear approach of the film works wonderfully because in real life a person's memories of any event are not in chorological order but tend to jump around as we think about the events which happened. The film is filled with pop culture references to movies and music, such as \\"The Smiths\\" and \\"The Pixies\\" and a very small band called \\"Spearmint\\"...even Han Solo is part of a stand out moment in the film. As for the story itself...well any guy or girl who has been in a \\"relationship\\" where the other person does not feel as strongly and sees it rather as a \\"friendship with benefits\\" will completely relate to this film. The story is presented in an honest way and from the start and there is no overtly saccharin sweet promises like you would find in the majority of romantic comedies out there today...you can simply sum it up as \\"boy falls madly in love, girl does not...but wants a no strings attached relationship which she knows would go nowhere\\"...and it could be a vice versa story...it doesn't matter whether you're a girl or a guy I think the viewer can relate either way...this is the universal beauty of (500) Days, `coz it doesn't matter whether you're in China or India or some small place in the world, someone somewhere has experienced a story like this in their own lives. And if you appreciate film and cinema as an art form you will love some of the camera techniques and choice of shots the director used to tell this story...split screen works amazingly well as a pure cinematic narrative tool in this film.  Sure \\"(500) Days Of Summer\\" is a little independent film..but it's a very different and enjoyably refreshing take on an old subject...If you liked films like \\"Juno\\" and \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\", give this one a chance and you may just be pleasantly surprised.  And I won't spoil it for anyone but the last 15 seconds of this film makes it worth the watch alone...
B003PZLGI2|5.0|A masterfully written episode of \\"what if\\" and \\"Is this real?\\" that ends up being considerably more dramatic than some Dr. Who episodes...while showing us that Matt Smith can still capture the sometimes dark side of the Doctor in his expressions and mannerism.  Karen Gillan as Amy Pond proves once again in this episode that not only is she one of the Doctor's most attractive companions, but she has a full range of acting chops, that you enjoy seeing her onscreen.<br /><br />Of all the Matt Smith episodes, this is easily my favorite--difficult to predict and full of twists to keep you guessing.  I highly recommend it.
0061997811|5.0|I love this book!  The illustrations as well as the 'extras' included are a necessity for any Harry Potter collector out there!

0061537969|5.0|I haven't read a complete book in over 10 years.  I'm educated, but a busy mom who just doesn't have time to read.  Someone told me about this book, so I decided to try it.  Not only did I finish it, but I finished it in 4 days, which is really a record for me.  I really didn't want to put it down, but I made myself because I knew I had to get up in the morning.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves dogs and life - It is a really great story.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I thought is was funny and a good watch for the whole family.  enjoyed the twist of two frogs versus one. I thought the story line was creative yet romantic at the same time.  Totally enjoyed it.
0316067938|2.0|It's too bad the series ended this way.  These books are a guilty pleasure never ment to be taken seriously, but Breaking Dawn was too much.  Everything in it was too conveinent.  The first three books make it seem like Bella is going to have to give up her whole life to become a vampire, but that does not happen.  Instead, she gets everythings she wants, and much more.  She gets to keep in touch with Charlie (ya right!), keep her friendship with Jacob, have a child, skip the newborn phase, and the list goes on.  But in my opinion, Jacob imprinting on the baby is the worst part.  Aside from being gross, it makes absolutely no sense. Vampires and werewolves are mortal enemies; and yet, he imprints on a half vampire?  I can't help but think about their chidren.  It doesn't seem likely that they will carry on the family tradition.  I doubt they'd want to kill vampires, or even have the ability to become  wolves for that matter.  That is a weak attempt to allow Bella and Jake to have the platonic friendship Bella always dreamed of.  Personally, I would rather have the series end with Jacob's heart still broken than have him in love with Bella's kid.  I also thought Edward's character was very odd.  He wanted his child to die, and then have Bella reproduce by Jacob?  So if Jacob tries to kiss her, Edward almost kills him, but if he and Bella have sex, that's ok.  Makes no sense coming from the guy that valued sex enough to wail until marriage.  And the \\"climax with the Volturi was really sad.  I kept waiting for something to happen--never did.  And I hate the alliance of the wolves and the Cullens.  After reading the other books, that's too hard to swallow.  Plus I hated the pack's split.  How depressing! A tradition of tribal unity dating back much further than Bella or any of the Cullens destroyed.  What a shame. To put it simply, lame book.
B003Y58CKS|4.0|This is a highly enjoyable DVD. Rigoletto is one of my favorite operas and I have seen and listened to it often. If you are new to opera it is a not a bad choice for a first opera. The characters are rapidly developed and the scenes all move quickly. The conducting by Luisi, orchestra, and chorus are all excellent. The staging here is interesting if somewhat distracting and emphasizes the lust of the Duke. I hope that the reviewer who said that Florez plans to drop this role from his repertoire is correct. It sounds to me like he is pushing and there is clearly some intonation issues on a couple of his high notes in this performance. Overall he does a great job. Damrau as Gilda is superb. Her death scene gave me goose bumps. Lucic performs and sings the role of Rigoletto very well. I agree with the other reviewer that the commercial recording on EMI (CD) with Callas, DiStefano, and Gobbi should be listened to. The Callas voice for many is an acquired taste but the performance is fabulous. DiStefano's voice in 1955 when the recording was made was still largely intact. Early DiStefano 1944-1955 documents what can happen to a  incredibly beautiful voice when pushed into heavy roles(Trovatore and Forza). Gobbi was one of the leading baritones of his generation and a great singing actor. Sutherland, Pavarotti, and Milnes on CD is well sung but emotinally bland. Maybe generic is a better word. It does document the Duke of Pavarotti which should be listened to. The DVD from the Met with Domingo, Cotrubas, and McNeil brings back memories of my college years in New York. It is as stated elsewhere a more traditional production. Excellent cast none of would be on my ideal cast list.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|I would give this CD 25 stars if I could!<br /><br />Top five reasons to buy this album:<br /><br />5) While I still hold that Kitka's rendition of \\"Schedryk\\" is the best I've ever heard, Pink Martini really hits it out of the park with their rendition of the traditional Ukranian \\"Carol of the Bells.\\"<br /><br />4) \\"Elohai N'tzor,\\" which is a traditional Hebrew tune which loosely translates to \\"guide my words to be kind.\\"<br /><br />3) One of the tracks features NPR's own Ari Shapiro singing in an ancient Sephardic Jewish language.<br /><br />2) Singing an album in six different languages already set the difficulty score on this album into the stratosphere. Now try making \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" sound fresh and original. Check.<br /><br />1) Little Drummer Boy aside, China Forbes uses masterful vocal control on \\"Silent Night,\\" with the result being an elegant, minimalist approach that lets the beauty of the song speak for itself.<br /><br />I hate Christmas music, but for \\"Joy to the World,\\" I will gladly make an exception.
B0034G4OVS|1.0|What a load of crap.  I am absolutely shocked at the high review ratings this film has gotten.  The main problem I have is the credibility of the characters.  The audience watches as the characters commit stupid, idiotic actions that are quite frankly unbelieveable.  In fact, the level of stupidity of the characters made it extremely difficult to identify/sympathize with their plight.  I was so angry when I left the theater that I came just short of asking for my money back.  Awful film with unbelieveable characters and a terrible ending.
0307454541|1.0|Reaching for this book when I woke up in the middle of the night was a sure-fire way to get back to sleep.  When I finished it, I felt the same as I did when I finished Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet.  Bewildered as to why it's so popular and mad at myself for being lured by the populace.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I love, love, LOVE Josh Groban the man, and have always previously, Josh Groban the musician. I've been a fan club member for almost six years now and saw him live three times for the Awake tour.<br />I LOVE his first three albums.  Awake was a slightly different direction from Closer and his debut album, but it didn't take long for ALL the songs to quickly grow on me, and for me to want to play it over and over.<br />Illuminations?  I wish Amazon provided half stars for product reviews! (would've been 2 1/2)  I pre-ordered Illuminations from FoJG in anticipation of loving it just as much as the other albums.  Unfortunately, it was not to be.  A bit too wide of a different direction, IMHO.  I, too, thought, Well, it's Josh; if I listen to it enough times, I'll love IT, too!  I DO applaud and respect his desire to further explore his musical talents, and I WANT to love it, but.....!<br />And for those few who say, Well, goodness, if you love Josh, you HAVE to love his new album! Sorry, I don't HAVE to.  I do still love and respect Josh, and will continue to espouse his many talents and wonderful, giving nature to others.  Just not this one particular endeavor.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I used to be the type of person who sat on the couch, watched \\"total body transformation\\" stories on television all the time, and thought constantly \\"Why can't that be me?\\" Then one day I became bored with that version of myself and purchased this DVD, ready for a change. I popped the DVD in and 20 minutes later...oh my word. It has been two years since I've actually \\"worked out\\" (I know, shame on me.) and I had my derrière handed to me. However, after the first two weeks of working out with this DVD, I proceeded to lose the excess of that part of my body, along with other areas. By the end of the \\"30 Day Shred\\" process, I lost a total of 8 lbs. Yes, it's true that 8 is very different from the intended 20, however, I am convinced that I did lose those 20 pounds, but gained 12 lbs in muscle. That's fine by me because with muscle gained and fat lost, the inches disappeared as well. Here are my reasonings...    1) Going up the flight of stairs in my house is no longer an ordeal for me.  2) You know how you have to stretch out t-shirts after they've been in the dryer in order for them to fit properly? Nope. Not me, that is a thing of the past now. My larges fit more like XL's, and my tee size is a medium now.  3) Before: 8 push ups  After: 27 push ups (on the toes)  4) My hoodie from two years ago fits me properly and it does not pull in awkward places.  5) I graduated from 3 lb weights to 5 lbs.  6) My thighs are the consistency of STEEL. No joke.    I consider myself \\"fit\\" now and I am looking forward to keeping myself that way and shedding the extra insulation by next Spring. I would definitely recommend this video to ANYBODY. Do not be intimidated by some of the 1-Star reviews posted for this DVD; in all honesty, the authors must not have watched the video or listened to Jillian properly. Some say she demands the extension of the knee over the toe too often, but if they actually listened to the advice Jillian gave during the entire production, they would know thatshe advises you not to do that, for risk of injury.     It's simple, effective, and worth your time and money. Enjoy!

B0041HU440|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this in the world of melodic rock with the original Unruly Child lineup creating a masterpiece album in 2010. The music here is absolutely classic with every song having a great chorus, lots of hooks, and some of the best production I've heard on a modern album. The sound is steeped in the eighties with lots of layering of electric and acoustic guitars, awesome keyboard parts that enhance the riffs, and a big rocking drum sound too. The band stays true to their style and gives fans what they want. The best thing about this album are the killer vocals by Mark (Macie) Free - absolutely outstanding! The melodies are stunning and the vocal arrangements are just of such a high quality that it makes this album a classic. Every song is a highlight but check out the nostalgic opener \\"Show Me The Money\\", the chorus hook of \\"When We Were Young\\", the stunningly memorable \\"Read My Mind\\", and the melodic perfection of \\"Very First Time\\". Worlds Collide is a modern classic from Unruly Child and will go down as one of the best albums in a very strong year for melodic rock. Essential for melodic rock fans who want to hear some of the best vocals ever recorded.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I would really love to love this headset.  Its battery actually lasts longer than you can comfortably wear it for, which is impressive since the headset is one of the most comfortable I've worn.  It does a great job damping outside noise without completely isolating you.  It has great features.  In every respect -- on a hardware level -- this headset delivers.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the software that makes the surround sound, voice morphing, etc. work has some kind of horrible memory leak.  During the five hours that I used the headset today, World of Warcraft crashed three times due to running out of memory.  I could tell that the crashes were coming because my friends would start to experience \\"tag\\" speech from me -- I'd say things over the course of a few minutes and nobody would hear anything until suddenly everything reached them at once.  I wasn't entirely sure that the headset was the problem until I finally got to where it was hurting around the ears.  I decided to switch back to my trusty old boom mic, which also meant changing WoW to use the sound card again.  The only problem was that the sound card wasn't available and Windows informed me that this was because there wasn't enough memory to run it.  I'd have to shut down something else.  Rebooting the computer brought my sound card back.  I left the headset turned off and played another five hours without a single issue.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you only play for an hour or two at a time and reboot your computer daily you should be quite pleased with this headset.  If you plan to use it for longer, expect to run into problems until such time as Logitech fixes the software issue.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I was biased when I first watched the pilot and didn't really pay attention (leaves and comes back to it and missing some scenes).  I came in thinking that they're trying to remake \\"It Takes a Thief\\".  I initially tuned in because I recognized Matt Bomer from Traveler & Chuck, though I didn't know him by name at the time. I had a chance to really watch it a year and a half later when USA ran a White Collar marathon and by the 2nd episode shown that day, I wanted more.  I bought the first season and had a chance to watch more of 2nd season on the website.  Now, I can't wait to own 2nd season on DVD.    The Neal Caffrey / Peter Burke interaction is wonderful.  It's not perfect, but they care about each other...no disrespecting each other.  The supporting cast really do shine in their own roles.  The caring June to Neal, the most helpful and again caring as well as funny/unique Mozzie, the supportive, loving and insightful Elizabeth (I think the glue to both Peter and Neal sometimes), the strong, smart and great-supporter-of-Peter Diana, and Jones, though in a small role, has strong presence. I like every single one of the supporting cast.    I also love the ongoing story about finding Kate.  Neal and Kate.  Love it.    The stories isn't based on shocking & gory images or crime (which turns me off to most crime-fighting shows) nor is it constantly bombarding the audience with sexual dialogs.  I get so involved with each episode and wondered how they can solve the crime and what unique ways they're do it this time...which comes from great writers of the show.   I like how the characters are developing through each episode ...they don't dwell on it constantly but touches on it enough. I can watch this with my preteens.  Love the smart dialogs and banter. Love all the sites of New York that they've shown. The attraction of this show is that it is just simply wonderful/ enjoyable entertainment.
B00000JMG7|5.0|Rory Gallagher is an almost forgotten force in rock music. this cd shows that he is a guitarist that could be compared with the likes of Jeff Beck, E ric Clapton, and Johnny Winters.
B003EYVY0E|1.0|\\"Ultimate Editions\\" Year 3 and 4. How disappointing.    No extended editions.  No magnetic clasp.  Low quality boxes- flimsy with bits ripped and stubbed.    Clearly made much cheaper than the first two. What crap! The first two ultimate editions were awesome.
B004AUGJS8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The actors are spot on, though I do find Kirsten Dunst almost too cute to believe. Ryan Gosling is quite convincing throughout. Frank Langella (sp) is perfectly cast as his father.  There are areas of the movie that I wish would have been explored more (the mother's background for instance), but this is not a mini-series.  The movie is well edited.    As I watched it, certain elements of the story started to sound familiar.  I think young people might enjoy the movie more if they did some research on the Marks family of New York City.

1400052173|5.0|I worked as a secretary in the Hematology/Oncology field and found this book to be very interesting.  I remember some of the terminology from work and understood what they were saying.  I really feel they didn't do right by the family.  Read it and see if you agree . . . . .
B0040I469O|5.0|What a great show!! The cast is amazing and the writing is superb. All the characters you feel for not one could you do without. Actually when someone is lost you actually feel sad about it and want them back. Great show not just about Cycle Gangs!

B001PA0FF4|3.0|I just finished watching a fantastic film for those of us who love \\"talkie\\" movies. Doubt (2008) is extremely well written, well directed, and well acted. Another great Miramax masterpiece! I'm just disappointed in myself for missing this movie back in 2008 when it came out.  But having confessed and repented by seeing it on Starz in HD, I forgive myself! I give the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. The film is a tense mind puzzle that teases you along like a greyhound chasing a rabbit, with the hope of getting the prize. And yet the film's payoff at the end is just like at the racetrack...not quite what you wanted, but enough to satisfy you with having run the race. I respect director John Patrick Shanley for his choice to let the built-up tension in the film fade more with a whimper instead of a bang. The obvious choice, and probably the one I would make, would be to bring the film to the dramatic \\"showy\\" climax that you expect. It took guts on Shanley's part to instead choose the more sophisticated and subtle ending that he did. It's upon reflection on the movie that I get the \\"bang\\" from it...reliving the great tense scenes over and over in my mind and imagining various alternatives.<br /><br />The above may sound a little cryptic, but I don't want to give away the story of the film. This film is all about the story and the characters. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis are absolutely brilliant in their intertwined roles within the parish. Hoffman is the Priest, Streep is the Principal of the school, Adams is a teacher within the school, and Davis is the mother of the first and only black student. All four of them bring their A-game to their performances and rightly deserved the four Oscar nominations they got for acting. I'm surprised none of them won, but it was competitive year as always.<br /><br />Doubt was a very well designed and photographed production, it's austerity is true to its subject matter and setting within a Bronx Catholic church in 1964. I never once questioned when or where I was. I easily escaped into this film's time period. The cinematography by DP Roger Deakins is just as we have come to expect from him and his other great work in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), House of Sand and Fog (2003), Thirteen Days (2000), Kundun (1997), Courage Under Fire (1996), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), and Thunderheart (1992)...to name just a few of his 50+ movies! He's by far one of the most talented and prolific directors of photography in the business.<br /><br />What I really love about Doubt is that it asks many questions and it gets you to ask yourself many questions. And you don't always get answers from the movie or yourself. But it's a thought provoking movie that looks at a number of important issues in our culture from several points of view...from the time period of  the 1960s when this film is set, right to the present. It asks questions about religion and spirituality, about gossip, about school...and it all feels as relevant today as I'm sure it was in the 60s and probably earlier. I'm gonna go out on a limb and predict that this movie holds up well for many years to come. I'll be interested to revisit it down the road in 5-10 years and see what new questions (and/or answers) I get from it.I never once questioned when or where I was.

0756655730|5.0|This book is an incredible bargain, comparable to books costing twice as much.  As with all DK books, it is clearly written, beautifully illustrated, and very comprehensive.  It traces life on Earth from its beginnings up through the beginning of historic times.  It's been endlessly fascinating to my grandchildren, ages 5 and 8, and will continue to be an excellent resource for them through their teens and even into adulthood.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I've never been a fan of the ABBA singers (My husband is an avid fan.) so I wasn't really interested when my granddaughter rented it for the two of us to have a night at the (home) movies, popcorn in hand.  What a surprise!  Lighthearted fun and excitement among the players, music and dancing that uplifts you in spite of yourself.  The writers did a fantastic job of fitting all those songs to the story...or did they write the story to fit the songs?  The ABBA music is really the driving force throughout the movie...or is the story the driving force?  Hard to tell...   Most of the actors did a great job singing and dancing and the story is clean and enjoyable.  I read an interview in which Pierce Brosnen stated that he'd never sang in his life and his singing is proof enough. Even his singing grows on you after a few viewings.   I enjoyed the movie so much I had to order it from Amazon!  Perhaps the cast was not made up of trained singers, but any deficiencies were covered by their super star performances.  Now my 3 and 5 year old grandchildren want me to play it every time they're here.   I even listen to it when  working at the computer or in the kitchen.  I have so much music in the house (I'm a classical piano teacher with degrees in music.) yet, I find this rendition of ABBA's music and the gaiety of the story the most contagious I've heard or seen in years.  In this time of so many trashy songs and movies this is a real family treat.
B002VECM6S|4.0|I would be put out that this is another 'white man saves the day!' film, except that this film is based on a true story.  And along that line, the film, and I assume the actual events, really strives to reach a humanity beyond social, racial and economic limits, and it succeeds.  While Bullock did well in her role, I didn't think she outshone any of the rest of the cast.  The chemistry and flow between all of them was flawless.  The direction and editing was smooth and logical, and the Atlanta settings were impressive.  I was a bit letdown that our version of the DVD didn't have any special features or pointers to the real story.  Still, the film is entertaining, inspirational, and endearing.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|I figured if Amazon had their name on the cable, it   would be good.   I was correct.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|Let's get all the non-essential stuff out of the way:<br /><br />Build:<br /><br />This little unit is very well built. The aluminum finish feels solid and looks sexy. It is quite light. It is as wide as an iPhone 4, about 4/5 the height, and a bit less than double the thickness. (This thing is pretty thick compared to the iPhone 4)<br /><br />Accessories:<br /><br />It came with a black rubber protective case that masks the sexiness of the unit. (on Fiio's official website I saw a white version of the case, may look better) Also included are a soft cloth pouch, a 3.5mm male to male cable, a pretty long USB-to-microUSB cable for use with computer audio. Finally, there is a rubber band that binds the E7 and a mobile DAP together, be it an iPod or Zune or Sansa whatever.<br /><br />Ports:<br /><br />One micro USB socket for charging and/or audio in from a USB sound source. This can be a computer, or your iPod with a LOD that has a USB out. USB charging can be disabled from the menu. A 3.5mm aux-in. A proprietary connector for docking with E9. TWO 3.5mm headphone outs.<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />Usability:<br /><br />I really enjoyed the flexibility of the E7. There are so many uses. At home I use it with my PC and Logitech Z-2300, while the extra headphone out lets me plug in a headphone so if I needed privacy I can just turn off the speakers.<br /><br />I use the E7 with my iPhone 4 when I'm mobile and want some quality audio (moving around the house, away from computer, or sitting at the library or something). I use a fiio L3 LOD to bypass the trashy amp IP4 has. The similarity in dimensions between IP4 and the E7 make them easier to carry around.<br /><br />I also use the E7 in the car, again with L3 to bypass the weak amp in the iPhone 4.<br /><br />The extra 3.5mm out makes it really convenient to share music. (I always carry at least 2 pairs of good headphones with me)<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />Sound:<br /><br />I completely disagree with those who claim the E7 does not improve sound, or even that it makes the music muddy and sound worse.<br /><br />My equipment: Sennheiser IE7, MX471, HD202. UE 700. B&O A8, Ath-EC700, Ath-em9r, Monster Turbine. Logitech Z-2300<br />My sources: Alienware Aurora, iPhone 4, Zune 30, iRiver T10. Various CDs, mp3 files ripped at 320kps.<br />My music preferences:  oldies like Dean Martin, Louise Armstrong, Sinatra; some rock/alternatives; Queen, Muse; some Chinese, Japanese, and French materials; musicals; and a little bit of pop/rap from the billboard's top lists.<br /><br />First of, the E7 greatly improves the performance of my desktop speakers, the THX-certified Logitech Z-2300s. Sound opens up greatly, becomes cleaner and clearer. Bass becomes powerful and more controlled.<br /><br />Same case when using E7 through LOD from my iPhone 4, the presentation becomes much less forward and the frequencies are less squeezed together, while the music stays involving and musical. I cannot say I enjoy too much E7 with IEMs like my IE7 and UE 700. They are easier to drive and sound fine without it. Plus I don't think they have good synergy. Earphones like the A8 would benefit more from it.<br /><br />The E7 really shines when used with my car stereo. The IP4 was too weak to drive those car speakers properly through the aux-in, and music sounded horrible. Muddy and unpleasant. The E7 completely fixed that.<br /><br />I know the sound is the most important part, but as it is mostly subjective and difficult to describe with accuracy, I cannot say too much except there is a noticeable difference when using the E7. Especially when listening to digital sources, the sound becomes much cleaner, sharper, and loses some of its bitrate feel. Whether or not it's a good thing depends largely on your source, your gear, and your own preference. (Sounds better with harder to drive, or colder-sounded phones)<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I think the E7 is useful at making digital music sound great and analog-y. However, one reviewer hooked it up with his turntable and said the E7 was terrible. He was probably right. The E7 was never meant for use with a turntable playing LPs. It was meant to be used in the modern digital world, sitting on your desk to help drive desktop speakers. And when you need to travel you can just grab it, for it will be fully charged (with a rated 80-hour battery life), hook it on your ipod, and make a mostly digital collection sound more enjoyable.<br /><br />If you are on a budget and/or likes flexibility, the E7 is worth a try.ne reviewer hooked it up with his turntable and said the E7 was terrible.

The runaway 30 min short film shows the creativity that exists within Kanye. Every single track is blazing hot. And for 3.99? Stop reading this and go buy this album. Support music and especially GOOD music.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Really, with over 3000 reviews, why am I here?  Because the series really is THAT good.  Good, complex characters; great dialogue (and memorable one liners galore); and beautiful effects.  I saw this after Firefly had been cancelled and after Serenity had already come out on DVD.  It was suggested to me by a friend who knew that I loved Star Wars, old westerns, and Joss Whedon's work on Buffy and Angel.  That makes me a pretty siloed watcher, but my husband, who is a card-carrying red-neck grease monkey from Arkansas loved this series as much, if not more, than me.  It transcends stereotypes.  :)      Blue Ray made it even better.
B003NFM3JU|2.0|Like other reviewers of this movie I was expecting something special from Disney with an old classic.  While the animation graphics are very detailed and impressive, the movie is not interesting or entertaining.  I have other previous  representations of A Christmas Carol that I have enjoyed watching over and over.  I can see no reason to put myself through another viewing of this one.  Also, I strongly recommend not showing this to younger children (older children will be totally disinterested).  I feel it very inappropriate for young children which is surprising considering it is a Disney product.
B004BSEKH6|4.0|Thing is, when the hype surrounding you is so huge, being \\"good\\" isn't even good enough anymore. People begin to expect greatness every single time out and that's tough to do for any artist or professional at what they do. To a kid that has made straight A's their entire life, a B is almost seen as a failure in the eyes of some. You get the point. All in all, the album is decent. Stand out tracks for me.     Roman's Revenge - 5/5 - Slim Shady did his thing on this track. Roman held his own too. great hook.   Right Thru Me - 4/5 - Catchy. I'm sure a lot of chicks can relate.  Fly - 4.5/5 - Rihanna does an amazing job. Two solid verses from Nicki.  Save Me - 5/5 - Amazing Song. I can \\"feel\\" this song. Some songs do that to you. You just \\"feel\\" it.  Moment for life - 4.5/5 - is it me or is Drake killing every feature these days??? I have yet to hear a bad verse from him.  Check It Out - 4/5 - Fun dance song. Great verse from Nicki.    The other tracks are decent. 3-4 range. If I could more accurately rate the album, I would give it a 3.75 (4 for production and 3.5 for lyrics) due to the massive hype and praise. I was honestly expecting nothing less than perfection, but a B will do. Disregard any reviews that gave this album a 1. Cmon, be real, they couldn't have listened to the entire album. :-/
0307341577|3.0|Meet Libby, survivor of the \\"The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas,\\" where her convicted child-molester brother slaughtered their family. Libby, only ten years old at the time, testified against her bother, sending him to prison for life, but when she meets a national \\"Kill Club\\" in search of some easy cash, she begins to doubt her brother's guilt as they do. For a who-dun-it, this is quite good. All the characters are loathsome and there are enough twists, turns, and chapter end cliff-hangers to keep you turning the pages, thought some might find the narrative choppy and abrupt. I especially enjoyed the shifting time and point of view; however, by the second chapter, I understood that the main character's narrative was present time first person POV, so the chapter titles: Libby NOW became annoying after a while. Even so, the book is quite a dark and violent thriller, but almost all the characters managed to redeem themselves in the end. Almost. I really liked that the story candidly addressed our rather inept legal system not to mention the uncomfortable notion that some children who claim abuse are not actually telling the truth. Because of their innocence and desire to please, a child's testimony can be manipulated and is often shaky at best. The book also addresses the alienation of youth and how susceptible the outcast teenager can be to negative influences. I didn't find anything that Ben \\"actually\\" did all that far off base. As for Libby, she reminded me a little of Lisbeth Salander in Dragon Tattoo, well, actually, she reminded me of Lisbeth a lot, except that Lisbeth you like immediately and Libby won't rub you quite the right way until the end of the book. Libby is selfish and hateful, choosing to exploit her victim status for sympathy and cash, which eventually leads to the truth, but it is a nasty way to get there. This is not a book for readers who need to like and connect with the characters. It's not just dark in its story, it's dark in its ideas and implications. It's a story about misinformation and misdirection. It's a story about the good and the evil in all of us.d implications. It's a story about misinformation and misdirection. It's a story about the good and the evil in all of us.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Awesome!!!  My husband watches it over and over again.  Just loves history and Band of Brothers shows it all.  Thank you for good, educational DVDs.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This series continues to produce huge belly laughs for me! I already own seasons 1-2 and will be buying season 4 as soon as it comes out. The value in this is great because you get a \\"full\\" season of 20+ episodes and not a \\"short\\" season for the same price (like some other shows!). The return from Antarctica and \\"Soft Kitty\\"...this is just a great season!
B004A1Y4UM|5.0|It is with immense relief that I can say after listening to the new Volbeat album for the second time...it actually EXCEEDED my expectations and emerges as possibly their best album so far! It's really exciting when the newest album from a band is this good because it makes you wonder if they've even reached their peak yet. 'Mirror and the Reaper' is a great opener and immediately sets the tone for the astonishing tour through musical bliss you are undertaking. Ripping right along you will witness track after track of sheer energetic / melodic mastery, including  the unforgettable 'Fallen', the ripping thrasher '7 Shots' and the melodic / haunting \\"Evelyn\\" with its occasional shocking and awesome death metal vocal bursts. 'Being 1' is an ultra-melodic romp that sounds like a hit single ready for radio play, while 'Heaven Nor Hell' features some of the meanest harmonica playing you'll ever hear before breaking into a 50s style groove fest complete with razor edge guitars and rockabilly lust in overdrive! While many bands tend to put their best songs toward the beginning of their albums Volbeat ends this modern classic album with possibly their best song yet - 'Thanks' is my favorite track on the album (a barroom anthem if ever there was one) because it's the one that's been playing over and over in my mind the most.    Volbeat's uncanny ability to clearly pay homage to their influences without sounding like a shameless rip-off of those influences is simply amazing. It is a VERY fine line to walk and this band does it with a rare combination of confidence, grace and honor. While some sections of their songs continue to sound like newly discovered tracks from Metallica and Slayer when they were at their peak (that's certainly not a bad thing as far as I'm concerned), and the rousing catchy 'Misfit' style vocal melodies are still on full display, Volbeat continues to craft an overall unique style that is almost impossible to describe. In this album they have managed toinclude even more of the best influences of rock 'n roll, rockabilly, punk & metal (including brilliant nods to such diverse influences as The Ramones, Social Distortion, Johnny Cash, and Mercyful Fate) without sounding disjointed in any way. Every song flows with a melodic mastery and raw energy that is a rare treat to behold.    I can wholeheartedly say that there isn't a single weak track on the entire album. Not since \\"Dark At Dawn\\"s self-titled album (back in 2006) have I been able to say that about a band. 'Beyond Hell / Above Heaven\\" is truly an incredible musical gem which proves that Volbeat is a consistent, rapidly rising force in modern music. If future albums are of this calibre (or better, if that's possible) the band will certainly achieve legendary status.    All fans of solid, powerful, energetic, melodic, ripping, catchy, confident music should have this album in their collection.
0307454541|4.0|What can I say about this convoluted who-dun-it thriller other than I just loved Lisbeth Salander. The story centers around Mikael Blomkvist who is on trial for libel at the beginning of the book. He loses the case, but before he has to serve his prison sentence, he is recruited by octogenarian industrialist Henrik Vanger to research the disappearance of his niece. An odd turn of computer hacking events teams our young disturbed Lisbeth with Blomkvist on a quest to catch a serial killer. As many sidelines as there are in the story, it only further helps to advance the \\"small world\\" theory and the notion that everyone has skeletons in their communal family closet. There are Nazi sympathizers, child abusers, rapists, sadists, secret torture dungeons, and a very James Bond styled ending with a ccorrupt businessman getting his comeuppance.<br /><br />As for the serial killer stuff, nothing is overly graphic, despite claims to the contrary. The violence is nothing you wouldn't see on the Sopranos. What I did especially appreciate was that despite the book being littered with misogynistic/sadistic men/monsters, Blomkvist was quite the opposite, pretty much going along with whatever any woman wanted of him. His long-time girlfriend is married, he has no problem having sex with the niece of his benefactor, and doesn't take the slightest issue with Lisbeth, who is many years his junior, throwing herself at him sexually. Some readers might take issue, but I thought his laissez faire attitude fit the story perfectly. He simply respected a woman's individual right to fulfil their needs and expected nothing of it in return.<br /><br />Lisbeth on the other hand is well beyond her issues. We only get dribs and drabs of her story, so it really is her will to survive herself that endears her to the reader. She's a fighter, and we all love a fighter. I watched the Swedish film version and absolutely loved it. I don't think any other actress will be able to play Lisbeth as well as Noomi Rapace. Sorry Hollywood, I just ain't buying your casting on this one. As for the book, much has been said of humanity's propensity towards violence, expecially violence towards the weak, and much has been said of the psychological defense mechanisms we put in place to survive ourselves. In this exploration, the book delivered. However, some readers might find the pacing a bit slow and some of the storylines overdone at the expense of the main serial killer plot point. I didn't mind and enjoyed most of the detail even if the text had more clich&eacute;s than I would have liked. However, I would have cut some of the unnecessary detail in order to give a more upfront and personal account of Blomkvist and Salander. Much of their backstory is ambiguous and needs to be inferred by the reader, which isn't really a problem, but for me, personally, I would have liked to get a little more intimate with both of them, sans the coffee.ry Hollywood, I just ain't buying your casting on this one.

B00004U8P9|5.0|I love this movie, and now I get to watch it whenever I want to.  I always missed the beginning or the ending when it was on TV, which was rarely, now its MINE!!!  A classic my friends and I can all enjoy anytime, and have several times since I received it.
B004B4RCDE|4.0|This is definitely a step up from her Rated R album. Some of her songs are really good to listen to and possess an upbeat tone different from her Rated R album. It seems as though she's starting to become a bad girl gone good, which is okay with me seeing as though her last album seemed a little depressing.    Some songs worth noting are \\"S&M\\" which is a funky dance song, with heavy beats and great to dance to. Her single, \\"What's My Name\\" is a catchy love song with a steady flow. \\"Cheers\\" is another catchy song, with no real substance, but still encourages people to let go of the bad past and enjoy life. \\"Skin\\" is a very freaky song if you ask me, but it is still captures her ability to do slow, sensual songs. In fact, all of the songs on here are worth listening to, but \\"California King Bed\\" sounds a little annoying.    My favorite song on the album is \\"Man Down\\" and I'm sure others will agree with me. She should do more reggae songs like this.    Overall, the album is definitely worth buying, but I wouldn't call it her best ever.
B003UBTX72|1.0|I am a Rolling Stones fan and a Keith Richards Fan ( the man has not changed in 30 years) however I could not even finish this book. It reads like it was written by a 12 year old for his \\"what I did this summer\\" report. What a waste of time.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I recently heard the track \\"Little Lion Man\\" on our local alternative radio station, and I could have sworn I was listening to the latest new song, albeit acoustic effort, from Blue October. Much to my surprise it was not Blue at all, but in fact a new band out of the UK - Mumford And Sons. Now having listened to this entire album, I am pleased to have stumbled upon them. They are a great group of musicians with some really talented song writing abilities. Cheers Mates, keep up the great work!

B00418NVMQ|5.0|We saw Lizzy & company last spring at a small venue in Burlington VT (Higher Ground) and I knew after her first few bars solo we were in for a treat. This DVD (shot in Philly) captures the essence of their performance. It's well produced and recorded. You can actually hear each individual instrument so kudos to whoever did the mixing. To say the band has energy would be an understatement. I think Lizzy's voice easily rivals the Wilson sisters of \\"Heart\\" and Pat Benatar. Give this DVD a listen and you'll say the same. Great value too; includes a CD of the show.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have the regular DVD set, but was intrigued to get the Blu-Ray set, and am not disappointed.  As disclosure, I am still working my way through the immense amount of information available, and am currently on Disc 6.    If you love the movies this is a set you must have.  While there is some repetition of some segments as one goes through all the extras, it is not objectionable.    Some of the materials were in the regular DVD set released in 2003, but there is a lot of new material that has the copyright date of 2009, and is quite valuable for fans of the movies.    I have not yet tried the MU-TH-UR mode yet, since in watching some of the supplemental information, I really want to go back and re-watch the movies, as some things were brought out that I may have missed initially.  I need to guard against 'overload'.    The disc set comes in a nice book type packet, although the individual discs sometimes have to be dug out.  The Avatar Collector's Edition has a nicer arrangement for providing the discs.    This set is something that you will go back to over time, so keep it handy.    The original movie still sets a standard as simply being very scary.  And I have come to a better understanding and appreciation of Alien3.    I think it is important for people to realize that the movies are meant to stand on their own, and not as remakes but as presenting the creatures in a new vision.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|First, I agree with what Jim \\"Firefighter\\" wrote! This is simply a feel good movie from the opening of it till the end of it. I say that and I'm certainly not even a Meryl Streep fan in the least. Still, she proved perfect for the part. As for Bronson not being able to sing that well, that just added to the fun experience! PERFECT!    This movie is about SMILES and FUN and that is exactly what you get in SPADES!!! It doesn't matter if it comes off a little cheesy at times, and as one reviewer said, a little like a third tier production, that just adds color and flavor to it!    For viewers who don't like musicals this movie will not appeal to you either. In my view, you either like musicals or you don't. For the borderline few who aren't sure whether they like musicals or not...this might be the one you want to choose to settle the matter once and for all.    To repeat...THIS IS A FUN MOVIE and no critics view is going to change that! The matter has been settled and the critics LOSE, and the viewer WINS! AMEN!!!!

B003UUFH5A|5.0|In a word... the SACD version is stunning!  I have several other versions to compare to, including the newer RVG Edition, the original Blue Note CD issue and a few versions of the LP.  The mix features a wider separation than the recent RVG Edition (more like the old Blue Note LP mix you love and remember), with lots of space around each instrument, and the sound is warm and intimate.  Kenny's guitar is all tube-amp warmth, the drums and conga have a tactile presence, the upright bass sounds full and natural and Turrentine's saxophone sounds big and glows like a warm fire.  A really outstanding job, Analogue Productions!

B004G600A4|5.0|Note: A friend of mine got the movie for me as a bootleg copy 1 day after it came out on DVD (though I was expecting the actual DVD).<br /><br />Disney has not lost its magic touch. They've been making quality, family-friendly movies since 1937 and still going strong. View it in 3-D. It's so worth it.<br /><br />The movie begins with a clip of Mickey Mouse in \\"Steamboat Willie\\" then the camera pans back to show Mickey in the 0 for \\"Walt Disney's 50th Animated Feature.\\" Very good reference to the past.<br /><br />The story is based on the fairy tale \\"Rapunzel\\" by the Brothers Grimm, and the film was originally titled \\"Rapunzel\\" but changed by the studio to lure boys in. Not a bad move, marketing-wise, but Disney should have kept the original title.<br /><br />Biblically-speaking, there is no swearing or sex (it's A DISNEY movie, people!! What would you expect other than singing, dancing, good old-fashioned fun and clean humor?). There is some mild violence, but it's handled discreetly, and it's usually comic (though there are some frightening scenes for little ones). ***BEGIN SPOILER*** One scene towards the end is adapted straight from the fairy tale, in which Rapunzel heals the Prince through her tears and his sight is restored (after he's blinded by falling into thorn bushes while jumping from the tower in rage at not finding Rapunzel there). Obviously, Disney changed it a bit to make it more family-friendly, but still, parents should still be there to reassure their little ones, AND never does the movie pretend to be anything more than a fairy tale (ie. \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" \\"Aladdin,\\" \\"Beauty And The Beast,\\" etc).<br />***END SPOILER***<br /><br />Alan Menken, the Academy Award winning composer of \\"The Little Mermaid,\\" \\"Aladdin\\" and \\"Beauty And The Beast,\\" wrote the songs for the film. My personal favourite song is \\"I See The Light\\"; a very heartwarming and romantic ballad that conjures up the ballroom scene from \\"Beauty And The Beast.\\" All the songs, though, are equally enchanting and fun. Pascal reminds me of a certain Caribbean crab. This film is reminiscent of the Disney films we know and love. I highly recommend it; the perfect film either for a date night, a family movie night or just for your own  entertainment.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I am not sure that when the first \\"Alien\\" movie was released in 1979 it never imagined that it would have the following that it has now in 2010. With 6 movies (including the 2 AvP movies) the fans get more and more eager for the next one to release.  This new set is just the thing that every fan needs as we eagerly await the new Ridley Scott Prequel that is in the works.  To have all of the 4 original Alien movies released in the Blu-Ray format is a dream come true.  The fact that they also released the Director's Cut of the 1st movie, the Special Editions of the other 3, and over 60 hours of special feautures makes this the most complete box set that any fan would ever want.  So if you haven't gotten it already...what are you waiting for and order it now on Amazon.

B003JXUXPW|5.0|I have seen Mr. Porter perform three different times. The last time at Smoke, last Wednesday. This most recent time, he had a smokin' band and he was up to the challenge. When the band and the singer challenge each other, and both step-up, it's a magical journey into the musical kingdom.     I bought the CD and I recommend it with unbridled enthusiasm. His voice reminds me a lot of Joe Williams, one of my favorite jazz/blues singers. He can interpret other people's songs- \\"Skylark\\", for instance- and does a beautiful job. But his own songs are the centerpiece of this CD. \\"Water,\\" \\"Illusion,\\" \\"Black Nile\\" and \\"1960 What?\\" are fine examples of the beauty, feeling, soul and social awareness that Mr. Porter puts into everyone of the songs he writes and/or sings.     As I was leaving Smoke, I told the owner that this man, in a fair world, should be filling up Giant Stadium. He should also be selling 100,000's of CD's. Buy one!
B002ZG98PA|5.0|With Tangled, Disney finally gets with it and recognizes that third-wave feminism is here to stay,  forever. The Disney princess has gone from demure, subservient beauty to confident, robust and  self realizing beauty. No longer will Rapunzel hide in the corner when an uninvited intruder scales her tower and climbs through her window. Instead, she repeatedly knocks him unconscious with an iron skillet, locks him in a closet, ties him up with her hair in a chair, interrogation style, and then forces him to agree to a deal. In the process, she directly contradicts her faux mother's deepest fears and warnings about leaving the tower. Nope, this is not your 20th century Disney princess. Its the 21st century Disney princess. This is one tough young woman who sets her own destiny, although not without deep-felt feelings of ambiguity and guilt about disobeying mother's orders (albeit a faux mother who definitely does not have the best interests of the young Rapunzel in mind).    For the lesser sex (aka, male homo sapiens), sit up and learn a few lessons. In spite of the  string of garbage you have consumed from Pixar for the last 12 or so years, the modern world is  not a series of testosterone-laden misadventures. Nope, to compete in this world, you had better learn to value and depend on Rapunzel's golden fleece as Flynn Rider does throughout this movie, particularly during the action sequences. In fact, you are only a secondary player in life.    It is fortunate that Disney chose Tangled, its 50th animated feature, to stay relevant. This film will likely go down as its greatest triumph, much better than those male-dominated also rans, such as the Lion King or Alladin. The visuals are strikingly gorgeous, perhaps even better than Miyazaki. It uses a rich cadre of characters and formats to present the content, including slapstick, mime, melodrama, Broadway musical, action, occasional Faustian undercurrents, and so forth. It pulls all the right emotional strings, supportedby a wonderful musical score. With two great feminist movies in a single year (Tangled and Alice in Wonderland), Disney stays relevant, and gets my vote.

Because it includes an outstanding performance by Tug McGraws son Tim McGraw.

If, on the other hand, you want a beefy (527 pages) expert guide filled with highly-technical information on every aspect of black and white photography from Framing and Displaying to Darkroom Techniques, this is the book for you.<br /><br />The information is concise and exhaustive, the photos are used for examples, not for wow factor and beauty. Do not expect flowery speech in this tome. DO expect the technical know-how that will take you from advanced to Pro or perhaps from Pro to Seasoned Pro. Amateur (I refer to skill level) photographers and those just getting into photography may want to steer clear until they have mastered advanced techniques and can understand technical camera speak and make sense of the enormous amount of graphics, charts, and camera settings recommendations contained within.<br /><br />This book would be highly recommended to advanced Photography students and Professionals.

B003TVMIDO|5.0|A great collection of his albums after the Beatles end and John's beginning. Yoko Ono has prepared a great box collection which you will not be upset with... John would be happy with this release and the love Yoko still has for him. Love John..? Then buy the collection..!
B003L1ZWG2|3.0|I was debating on whether I should get this movie or not. Yet, since there wasn't anything else that I was interested in, I went ahead and got it. Is the movie any good? Well, I would say its OK. I wouldn't see it in the theaters, yet, its more like a \\"stay at home and watch\\" movie. Its a pretty simple story line. No high-tech / high action or high terror movie, yet, it does have emphasis on how ignorant young adults can be just for the thrill of skiing.     My recommendation is, if you don't have anything else to watch, then its worth looking at it. Other than that, its a \\"made for TV\\" movie. No Block Buster here.

B003L20IHE|4.0|This is a searching film, a film that searches for the answers as to what happens in the metaphysical realm at the threshold of death. As the story begins, Charlie and his brother, Sam are in the winners' circle. They are great both at sailing and at their academics. However, a fatal car crash soon changes all that.<br /><br />Both the brothers die in the crash, however, only Charlie is eventually brought back to life. However, it would appear that his crossing over into the realm of death, even though it may have only have been for a few minutes, has changed him. He is now able to communicate with the dead, maybe his 'sixth sense' has been awakened by this experience.<br /><br />Over the next few years, Charlie has abandoned going to university, and has taken up a lowly job maintaining a graveyard, where every early evening he meets with Sam. He also has an encounter with a former classmate, who had joined the U.S. Marines and was killed in action.<br /><br />**** Potential Spoiler Ahead ****<br />---------------------------------<br /><br />The film is just about to stall and go into a nose dive when enter Tess, a young pretty independent sailor of some renown. A romantic relationship starts to develop between Charlie and her. It is at this point the story blurs and a romantic game of \\"find me\\" in the dark turns into a life and death search and rescue event.<br /><br />Charlie is able to discern a message from Tess, indicating that he needs to find her, in order to save her life, this is apparently the reason why he was given a second chance at life. The movie has its sad moments, but overall, it is quite uplifting. Never say die.

1582406723|3.0|Police officer Rick Grimes is wounded in a stand-off with a criminal and ends up in a coma for a month. Waking up, he finds the hospital abandoned, no staff in sight and a bunch of flesh-eating zombies walking around. Learning that the undead have risen and destroyed much of civilisation, he resolves to head for Atlanta in the hope of finding his wife and son.    Over the past seven years, The Walking Dead has become one of the most popular comic series around, attracting critical acclaim, strong sales and a well-received television adaptation from Frank 'Shawshank' Darabont. Days Gone Bye collects the first six issues of the comic, forming an introduction to the series, the premise and the characters.    This is mostly scene-setting stuff, and features relatively little that will startle or surprise readers. Rick wakes up (in a virtually identical - but given the timing, coincidental - manner to the movie 28 Days Later, which in turn appears to have been inspired by Day of the Triffids), learns about the Zombie Apocalypse which, in fine tradition, goes completely unexplained, and sets out to find his missing family members, in the process learning more about the post-apocalypse world, how to fend off the zombies and so on and so forth. Once he finds shelter at a small camp of survivors outside of Atlanta, traditional leadership struggles emerge as the group tries to survive the zombies outside and intrigue within the camp.    There is little here which is really notable or transformative in the zombie genre, lacking say the different, documentary-style approach of Max Brooks's World War Z. What it does do is use the traditional zombie tropes to drive a familiar story and do it in an entertaining manner. The group of survivors is made up of various archetypes who are lacking in originality or notable depth, but there are some nice flourishes to the characters that makes them identifiable and interesting. Kirkman engages with cliche in many areas, but also backs offfrom it in others: his zombies can survive decapitation and Rick's hunt for his family could have been a long-running arc, but is in fact resolved very quickly.    Dialogue is often clunky and overburdened with exposition, but Tony Moore's artwork is effective. The black-and-white, sparse images intermittently get over a feeling of a dead or dying world, whilst his zombies are often more detailed and impressively-drawn than the living characters. This gives rise to the feeling that, rather than the zombies being the walking dead, it's actually the characters who are now devoid of life and purpose (backed up by the constant arguments through the second half over what the group should do next). This is an interesting idea and it'll be telling whether this is developed in future volumes.    Days Gone Bye (***) is a little too traditional and plays things too safe for a zombie epic, but clunkiness aside is an effective enough opener to make the reader try at least the second collection to see where the story goes next. It is available now in the UK and USA.

B003T70EWA|2.0|The songs on this album are just not at all what one would expect of a jazz guitarist. There's Rock, Blues, song with Rock Blues and Jazz in the same song, and 3 jazz tunes (out of 15 tracks). The rock stuff sounds very Eric Johnson'ish. Not at all what I was expecting (I didn't preview the songs - I see Lee Ritenour and figure it's an automatic buy) and I wish I'd previewed the songs before buying. Just not a good album IMO.

1439177783|2.0|I had such high hopes for this book, so it goes without saying how disappointed I was when a 1/4 of the way through I felt like I could have summarized the remainder of the book. As a recovered anorexic and gay girl myself (who loves a good memoir!), I found Portia's story repetitive, self-absorbed, and surprisingly impersonal. For 305 pages long, I came away learning little about her except that between measuring out her egg whites, Portia hates herself. A lot. The whining that comprises the majority of the text grows old very quickly and feels more like a how-to guide for anorexia, which I think is particularly reckless. I was disappointed that there wasn't more of a framework established in which she could tell the story as a personal narrative, including her recovery. It mostly felt like a tally of her worst days divided into chapters, each one feeling the same as the one that came before. Towards the end, I found myself skimming pages, knowing that it wouldn't matter if I missed a paragraph, because it didn't say anything new. The exception to this was the epilogue. It was by far the most interesting section of the book. Here she seemed to open up a little, sharing stories & details on her life and loosely touching on recovery. If only the whole book were like the epilogue I might have enjoyed it a little more.
0740797719|5.0|James Gurney is known for his illustrations and Dinatopia books, but a quick look on his blog will show he is a master of pleine aire painting, portraiture and landscape.<br /><br />I would not call this book one of 'color theory' but rather, a survey of different techniques and observations about color, and a survey of different color theories. In short, it is the distilled wisdom of James Gurney's experience as an artist.<br /><br />Frankly, I think this is a much better way to learn about color and light than a single 'unified field' theory - because most single color theory or methods rarely are applicable to all circumstances.<br /><br />Each concept is accompanied by one or two paintings illustrating the concept.There is also a pretty thorough reference and reading section for those who want to dig a little deeper.
B004132I4S|1.0|Sorry, I love music and I love different stuff.  I don't even mind cursing in an album that is not Christian, I just delete the song.<br />However, I do have trouble if it IS a Christian dude.  He has many followers that are Christian and I was just bummed.  The naked lady drawing in the liner notes too was not in my taste.<br /><br />I am sure many will like this.  I am not trying to comment on the music or anything.  I just know others will be bummed too.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I can not say enough good things about this album. It is Josh's best work to date. \\"Straight to You\\" is the most beautiful song I have ever heard and I have seriously listened to it on repeat over and over for days. I don't think I could ever get sick of this song.   When Josh performed \\"My December\\" in concert a few years ago, I knew he had a rock side and I totally fell in love with it. This album is the perfect reflection of that side of him. He writes beautiful music and when he picks songs from others, he picks beautiful songs and then makes them amazing.   My husband thinks Josh has some sort of tremulousness to his voice that I honestly don't hear and don't think I would care if I did. I love Josh's tone and I think this album is his best singing so far.   I love all of Josh's music and this album definitely did not disappoint. It is the best album I have heard in years.  Other highlights are \\"The War at Home\\" and \\"Bells of New York City\\" but I honestly can't think of one bad song on this album. Galileo is not one of my absolute favorites of his but the song has a nice sentiment. Awesome Awesome Album.

It's worth your investment.<br />Debbie B. (From Florida)
0439023521|5.0|This is a seriously wonderful book.  Well-written, exciting, and emotional, I finished this book literally breathless.  I cared deeply about the characters and their struggles, and couldn't wait to get more.  I highly recommend the entire Hunger Games trilogy.
0756665949|2.0|More than an encyclopedia this reminded me of a Kid's picture book. Each page was crammed with several large photos with a little bit of verse off to the side. As an avid viewer of the series who watched until the very bitter end I was hoping that the \\"encyclopedia\\" (being that it was supposed to be an encyclopedia) would have some answers and tell you things that you couldn't get by watching the show.<br /><br />Instead I found some glaring ommissions from the show, complete non-answers, typographical errors, and just plain mis-information. I was horrible disappointed with the encyclopedia, and -much like watching the last season- found myself struggling to get to the end.<br /><br />As other reviewer's have said, go pick this up at the bookstore and glance through to see if this is really what you want. If it is, then pick it up, however if you, like me, expected answers, then this book is not for you.

However, since I will always have a place in my heart for that film, I desided to just go ahead and order my very own copy!!  I got to thinking,why haden't I done this years ago!!  To think all this time I could have been viewing my very own copy any time I got the itch to see it.  So to all of you out there, don't delay get your very own copy so you too can have a Rocky Horror night with your friends.  ciao!!

1439102813|5.0|I know that my grandfather (my mother's father) had dementia, passing away this past August 2010. I feel that my mother is also going through lost of memory, so I am researching and reading this book, my first book on Alzheimer's disease. I have learned a story of a highly, successful scholar with such triumph and love for her career go to a place that is unknown, and unreal. This book kept me reading, and this is the first book in more than ten years that I have actually finished for the first time. I know there is a reason for this book to be an awesome reality for anyone experiencing with a member or friend with Alzheimer's. I cried a couple of times throughout the book, just because I can connect with the experience. I feel for my mother and therefore, I am looking to understanding her case of lost memory...
0756656230|5.0|Are you a Lego fan? ... If the answer is yes, then you must purchase this book. It doesn't matter what your age is, you will enjoy going through this book over and over again.   I purchased this book for my boyfriend as a birthday gift but I couldn't help going through it a few times before wrapping it up. We had looked at it various times at the bookstore but never purchased it because it was full price there so I got it for him here at Amazon because they always have anything for way cheaper than most places.  The great thing about this book is that it's actually 2 books that come in a box. One is about Lego in general like sets they have made throughtout the years and the second book is about minifigures only. The minifigure book was my favorite because of course that's the best part of any Lego set...the minifigures. It shows the very first minifigures they did to the most recent ones and it divides them by type of set they came in. It doesn't show all the minifigures they have made but it does show the most popular or important ones.   Once again.. don't hesitate to buy this book for even a second. It's well worth the money even if you do happen to buy it at full price. The pictures are very colorful and will entertain you every time you look at it. This is one of those books that you can look at over, over, and over again and never get tired of.

B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This is my first LEGO game purchased, and boy is it fun.  I played with my adult siblings and a preschooler.  We were laughing our heads off the whole time!<br /><br />The cards each have four categories/pictures that you can build from the LEGOs depending on what the die roll says.  How you build depends on the person - maybe you actually build the piece to look like the picture, or you build to illustrate a concept, or you use the pieces like lines to \\"draw\\" your word.  It's basically charades, and the players decide what is allowable or not (like sound effects, motions with the LEGOs, etc.).  The best part about the game is that it can be very free form with the rules depending on the players ages and how creative they want to be.  Also, players can decide how specific/complex the correct words have to be (boat vs. sailboat vs. catamaran).  So, this game is scalable in complexity from grade school to adults.  This makes it a very inclusive game that the whole family can play together.<br /><br />Right now, the game price fluctuates a little, but seems to range in the low $30's.  That is not a bad deal since you get >300 pieces of LEGOs.  I try to get LEGO's &lt;10 cents/piece.  This is comforting in case you really dislike the game, and it's past due for return, you can just roll the pieces over into other existing LEGO sets.  There is a good variety of basic to specialty pieces.  You can also add pieces from other LEGO sets to enhance gameplay.  I suspect that if you don't keep tight control on the game set, a lot of pieces will get pilfered by the kids to augment other LEGO sets.<br /><br />My only gripe is that only one full figure with \\"guy\\" hair and one super-tiny figure are included.  It would have been better to include a couple of LEGO figures in the set for those that want to play with multiple teams.<br /><br />Lastly, I have to give a shout out to my bro who guessed \\"windmill\\" correctly when I only had three pieces put together!

0312600844|5.0|Jonathan Franzen in my humble opinion is probably the best American author writing today.  Not since the great John Updike with his fabulous Rabbit series has their been an author as compelling as Mr. Franzen.  When reading some of the reviews on Amazon it is hard to beleive that we are all reading the same book.  But why be surprised?  There are people, afterall, that believe that Sarah Palin should be the next president.  I believe that it is safe to say that some reviewers are judging the book because of their political biases or prejudices.     Freedom is an incredible page turner!  Look at what one of the negative reviewers says \\"I don't believe in liberal middle-class parents who'd let their teenage son move in with their obnoxious Republican neighbors\\".  Why not?  I'm sure a great many parents would laugh at this silly remark and say that there are many more worse things that a child could do.  What kind of silly observation is that to make about why he doesn't think he could recommend the book? Later, the same critic states \\"I don't believe in a talented college athlete who'd let herself be hoodwinked for years by a ditzy, obsessive fan.\\"  Well this in fact is quite easy to believe when the athlete is looking for a friend.  The athlete in question finds herself feeling lonely in the univesity.  Remember, she never had parents that ever saw her compete despite the fact that she was a star athlete in high school.  In college she finds a fan that cheers for her, that is also looking for support, for a friend.  Why is this so difficult to believe?    Then the same critic says \\"I don't believe in a couple who remain married, but utterly incommunicado, for 6 years.\\"  Why is it so difficult to beleive that a couple that has been married for over 20 years can separate, but yet not decide for the final break by legally becoming divorced?  First of all, the couple have not been incommunicado.  They have been communicating indirectly through their children.  They are still emotionally involved with each other and are unsure of how to move on to the next phase in their lives, and they have children that they care about immensely.  Given their circumstances, it is definitely quite understanble why they have not opted for divorce.    What we have in Freedom is a great American novel that presents characters struggling through all different phases of their lives:  the student finding herself alone in a university that she has chosen because it is far removed from her roots, from her family; the young teenager deciding to move out of his house and into his neighbors in order to find the freedom to live away from an overprotective mother; the lawyer that finds himself working for a firm that seems to politically represent everything that is the opposite of what he believes in.  Watch him justify it to himself and to his family.  Why?  That is easy to answer...you have to fight to survive, like the species that he says he is fighting for. Expect growing pains.  Justify the reasons and accept the job, and you will be able to move out of the poor suburbs of St. Paul and move into a mansion in Georgetown.  Survival of the fittest by way of economic Darwinism!  This is not an essay...just a short review.  If you love Sarah Palin you will probably not like this book. It is deep and magnificent.
B00006GO99|5.0|When this album first appeared--the initial Columbia release by the musician who had been relatively obscure even among the jazz community before his so-called break-out album of 1957, \\"Brilliant Corners\\" (Riverside)--it was greeted with less than universal enthusiasm by fans and critics.  On the heels of big record sales by Brubeck, Miles and even Mingus, Columbia decided to let go of its fading, overly familiar greats (viz. Duke Ellington) and add the rising star of Thelonious Sphere Monk to its line-up of jazz heavyweights.  The result is a fine session by Monk and arguably his most consistent (certainly longest-standing) tenor player, Charlie Rouse.  As characteristically \\"Monkish\\" as the date is, there's nothing exceptional about it.  In addition to the interplay between Monk and Rouse, the album features Monk's revisioning of the stride-piano tradition (\\"Body and Soul,\\" \\"Just a Gigolo\\"), thus placing him squarely within the jazz tradition as much as demonstrating the qualities that made him unique--a \\"modernist\\" as judged by any generation--though sounding much the same in the 1960s as he had in the 1940s.<br /><br />\\"Blues Five Spot\\" may be the most accessible port of entry for some listeners--at least for those unfamiliar with the American Songbook and its interpretation by pianists such as Tatum and Peterson.  It's a blues (scarcely more than 3 minutes in duration), and Monk's solo, as usual, is as accessible as it is inventive.  In fact, one of the better musical analyses of a Monk improvisation, or \\"extemporaneous composition,\\" is that by Martin Williams (in \\"The Jazz Tradition\\") of this seemingly minor piece.<br /><br />Noticing that Amazon's 2nd-best-selling Monk album also comprises only his work for Columbia, it's easy to encourage anyone who's serious about Monk and American music to pass this one up and go to the album that's now appearing in the #3 slot: \\"The Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall - '57\\").  Not only is it some of the best music recorded by either soloist, but it certainly must rank as the most important new release in jazz of the present millennium.  (And for the listener interested in \\"Brilliant Corners,\\" nothing less than the original recording on Riverside will do. Columbia's decision to re-record the '57 date in a shorter version, using a \\"smoother\\" sound (i.e. a slick, electrifying Creed Taylor mix or a Teo Macero '70s Miles date rather than an elemental, ultra non-slick construction from the flesh and blood conception of Monk) strikes me--like most non-Monk performances other than those by Sphere, Walter Davis Jr., and Carmen McRae--as a travesty of the pulsating heart and soul of the original maker).<br /><br />Although Monk's repertory of original compositions was limited to approximately 70 tunes, there are some not on this collection that should be considered required listening.  \\"Monk's Mood\\" has perhaps never been played better than on the aforementioned Monk-Coltrane concert recording.  For \\"Mysterioso\\" check out the version on \\"Sonny Rollins, Vol. 2\\" (Blue Note).  It features Sonny,  J.J.

1553655427|3.0|The main premise of this book is that aid given to Africa by wealthy nations is ineffective in helping African countries become self-sustainable. Dambisa Moyo uses facts and statistics to support her theory that instead of aid being beneficial to African countries, it has caused them to regress because they have no incentive to devise ways to grow so that they become economically independent. According to Moyo, countries that either rejected aid or weaned themselves off of it have seen a rise in the standard of living in their countries. That is because they have worked towards avoiding being dependent upon the goodwill of wealthier nations, and therefore having to live under the rules imposed by the USA and Eurpoean countries.    Moyo appears to believe that Chinese operations in Africa is more beneficial to African countries than the aid given by other countries. The reason is because China is helping local businesses grow which creates jobs and plants the seeds for Africans to create wealth. According to Moyo, many of the economic policies used by aid donors is destructive to African businesses because they are not able to compete - in their own countries - against foreign companies that are subsidized by their wealthy governments. China's focus has been to do business with Africans so that they can help create opportunities for themselves; American and European aid has often been siphoned away by despots who transfer that money to European banks, as opposed to keeping it in their own countries.    I like the belief that aid can breed laziness where Africans have no incentive to become independent. But I believe that more time is needed to see whether China operating in Africa will be good for Africans.      [[ASIN:1449589359 The Corrupting of the Redeemer]]
B002VKE1K2|1.0|fortunaly i was lent this movie and was told the beginning was slow. I was not told  however that the end does not get much faster or better. I did like it being filmed as real footage from the homeowners who are having a haunting problem. I feel the movie has good potential but failed to meet it. This movie would qualify for a refund at the theater. I felt cheated of my time, and if i purchased it my money also.  Im easily startled, but was not moved much by this movie. Maybe once or twice i was stimulated but other than that prettr boring. I would say dont waste  your time watching it, even for free or borrowing the movie it just was not worth the time.

The characters are craftily developed, the plot woven perfectly and everything ties together amazingly well.  The intricacies that have been imagined for the world here are truly amazing.  There are also some really insightful and clever quotes strewn throughout the book which I enjoyed a lot. The quantity of text in this case probably even warrants the 12+ price for the Kindle book.  The only negative that I can think of is that at times, the book will go into tangents like the childhood memories of a certain character, in excruciating detail, when the story is in the middle of a really intense location within the core plot.  These tended to slow down the book a little.  However, these occasions were rare and can't stop me from rating this an excellent read.  Count me a believer in Brandon Sanderson.

B000002KFJ|5.0|This is by far the Best Album that Black Sabbath ever produced. Now you might bring up Paranoid and/or Iron Man as the best songs the group ever recorded. Here I am talking about the best album. It is a shame this album isn't talked about more. Many people I know who are die hard Ozzy fans are shocked when they hear songs like Hole In The Sky or System of the Universe.  They are shocked to realize that these awesome songs slipped their conscience when thinking about the work of the Prince of Darkness. This is a MUST HAVE for any Black Sabbath/Ozzy Osbourne fan!
0307271862|1.0|The author's distorted view of China made me wonder if he had ever been to Beijing. There are too many things wrong with this book. I won't repeat what ever reviewers have pointed out. I just want to point out one small but important detail, which demonstrates the absurdity of this book.    The professional killer in the book left a map in his hotel room near the crime scene, in the map he circled the building of his employer and wrote down the name of the hospital next door to the address.     Initially I thought the killer intentionally did that. No. it's an \\"honest\\" mistake by the killer! what a joke like rest of the book!    I understand it's a fiction. The historical accuracy isn't important. But his view of Chinese Chair Mao and Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe was out of wrack. It's analogy to the view that Hitler put Jewish people in the concentration camp with good intention to help them. I have to doubt the agenda of the author.     The start of book was excellent. That's the only good part.

0385737955|4.0|Two years after someone or something places about 50 teenaged boys in a (p 5) \\"...vast courtyard several times the size of a football field, surrounded by four enormous walls...hundreds of feet high...\\" that the boys dub the Glade, the Box, a sort of open elevator, arrives with its latest monthly addition, a teen named Thomas. Though he knows little more than his name, things do seem familiar. During his first night in the place, he makes a bold, brave, rule-breaking move, seen as stupid by some, courageous by others, controversial by all. Unexpectedly, the following day the Box again appears, bearing a new inhabitant like no other they've had before. Things get increasingly unusual from that point forward. Thomas wants to become, earlier than is usually allowed, a Maze Runner, whose goal is to find a way out of, that is, solve, the Maze. This requires evading the boys' brutal predator, slimy mechanized blobs called Grievers. The arrival of the last Glader triggers a series of unusual, unfortunate events, and messes with their formerly like-clockwork schedule of happenings within and outside the Maze. The teen inhabitants are thus forced to take big risks hinging on a huge assumption in an attempt to escape to safety.<br /><br />Best of the book is the author's skill at revealing just enough information at exactly the right time to keep the readers' interest, making The Maze Runner a fast-paced, interesting read. Worst of the story is its lack of believability in several places, the \\"f\\" word disguised (and used frequently) as the \\"sh\\" word, and one totally inappropriate, blatant reference to teen sex. Below are my specific concerns, which, fyi, contain SPOILERS. Read on at your own peril:<br /><br />(1) Totally inappropriate blatant reference to sex: Teresa telepathically conveys to Thomas (p 283) \\"Maybe we were lovers.\\"<br /><br />(2) The main swear word (used about 50 times) is \\"shuck\\" rhymes with...you know. It's better than using the actual word, but every time you read it, you know what word it's replacing.<br /><br />(3) When Thomas first enters the Maze (at night in order to help Alby and Minho), he spends what seems like, at most, a few hours dragging Alby up a wall to safety; however, once he encounters Minho and they work together to deal with the Grievers, an entire night has conveniently passed (as the doors will soon open, releasing them from the Maze).<br /><br />(4) The Grievers as a slug-like slimy, blobby creature with metal appendages just didn't work for me. Unless the creature was like - oily greasy, the whole - wet metal (stainless steel, maybe) does not seem like a good combination of materials.<br /><br />(5) Fifty or so teens, chosen because of their intelligence, can't figure out that there is a Griever Hole, but once Thomas shows up, they do so almost immediately. Similarly, these bright kids haven't been able to figure out what the Maze means after spending hundreds of hours pouring over the maps, but once Thomas shows up, with little more than Teresa's statement that (p 236), \\"The Maze is a code,\\" they do. Also, the teens are able to superimpose these hastily drawn (no doubt - not to scale) maps and view the letters they form.<br /><br />(6) We learn that the experiment is survival of the fittest, yet at the end, the Grievers seem to be grabbing a random Glader each day, throwing the survival of the fittest theory to the wind.<br /><br />(7) Chuck, who has not shown a single brave moment during the entire story, saves Thomas's life by taking a knife meant for his friend.<br /><br />Similar: Malice by Chris Wooding. Better: The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and the Maximum Ride Series by James Patterson.what word it's replacing.

B00003CX8Y|3.0|The movie is one of my favorites, and a complete classic. I'm not reviewing the film, but rather, the product.    The colors have been drastically altered from their original versions, and it's really horrible. They made the colors so over-saturated that I had to dim my screen by half- and they still were too bright.    The reds are no longer the rich rusts they were- but rather a glaring fire-engine red. I got out my old VHS tape, and the colors are so much better than this. I don't know who was in charge of remastering the colors of this glorious film, but they were so heavy handed that they really ruined some scenes visually. 'Belle's Song' (the opening where they all sing bonjour!) was impossible to look at in some instances because of how bright the reds were.    It's a shame that they did this to such a great film.
B002ZG999U|4.0|What THE EXPENDABLES boils down to is the Second Wave's version of \\"Boit an Koik\\" in TOUGH GUYS.  This is a manic romp through every Beer Film cliche ever created.<br /><br />Stallone taps his role in COBRA to find himself as the boss of \\"The Expendables\\" a bunch of hard-core mercenaries a la \\"The A-Team.\\" This bunch, mostly without women, is a beer-drinking, hog-riding fraternity, dedicated to kicking @$$.  Jason Statham (CRANK), Jet Li and Mickey Rourke are the biggest names here. They are hired by the mysterious \\"Mr. Church\\" (Bruce Willis in a suit) to overthrow the corrupt Banana Republic President (David Zayas of DEXTER) of a fictional sort-of South American country. If this sounds a little like COMMANDO, with The Governator, no surprise. The Hon. Gov makes an uncredited appearance as a cranky competitor for the job. As Schwartzenegger bangs out, Willis asks Stallone, \\"What's his problem?\\" \\"He wants to be President,\\" Stallone deadpans, just as Ahnold turns and smiles.<br /><br />I said, \\"mostly without women\\" and that's true, except for Statham's love interest who gets punched out by her boyfriend. Statham shortly thereafter disassembles the guy like a Lego set. Oh, and Stallone's crush, the daughter of the Puppet In A Hat President of the falling-apart country he's been hired to overthrow.<br /><br />The Expendables head down to the island, where they come ashore anything but quietly and start blowing everything up, obviously having read THE DOGS OF WAR for inspiration. After they end up torching everything that moves, including the American expat who runs the obligatory drug ring (LETHAL WEAPON, anyone?) they turn the country over to Stallone's squeeze and fly off drinking beer and singing.<br /><br />It's not a great film. It's not even a great beer film. For one thing, the cast takes themselves WAAAY too seriously. For another thing, THE EXPENDABLES is so ramped up over the top that you have to be smoking meth to catch it all. Thirdly, the script just doesn't have enough one-liners and wisecracks. And although it has Dolph Lundgren, Stallone, Willis, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Mr. \\"I'll be back,\\" the rest of the crew are relative unknowns who never placed a paw print in the Beer Film Genre. Where's Chuck Norris?<br /><br />Still, this is an homage, not a Johnny-Come-Lately Original, and it knows it. These guys are all long in the tooth. It's good to see the 1990 Graduating Class of the Clenched Jaw School of Acting having a twentieth reunion. With guys like this we didn't need Homeland Security. Just brass knuckles.

B001WCN232|2.0|This is the first of the Remasters I purchased, not because it's my favorite or anything like that, but because I saw a good deal for it in the record store.  I don't really hear a whole lot of difference between this and the CD I bought years ago.  I compared the two with headphones on and the only real difference I could tell is that it is louder.  I guess I could have remastered this album myself with a turn of my volume knob.  Maybe my ears aren't as trained as some other peoples, but that's all I can tell.  And then of course there is the editing of \\"Star Star\\", which is a shame because it is one of the few songs on this album that I really like, the others being Heartbreaker and Angie.  From what I've read this was a mistake, as it was the version of the song originally released in the U.S. back in '73, and they didn't mean to put that on this reissue, and that the mistake has been corrected on later pressings.  This begs the question of how much care and painstaking remastering went into these albums if a mistake like this was made?  Clearly they weren't paying that much attention.  It also makes me think that these two different versions need to be labeled, because in stores and on Amazon I have not been able to find edited and un-edited versions, I guess you just have to buy it and hope you get the right one.  And before anybody says that editing a curse word isn't that big of a deal, the way it is done is very strange and really annoying.  Had the word just been muffled or something it wouldn't have been nearly as bad, instead an edit of Mick's voice comes in out of nowhere and is shouting over the word and you can hear both voices like a jumble of stupidity.
B000002MTU|5.0|Where Me and Mr Johnson focused on acoustic blues ( great job  btw ) , this album is quite different . It's plugged - Very plugged  . If you want to know why Eric Clapton is held in such high esteem , buy this album .<br />It's an album of covers by blues greats like Eddie Boyd , Lowell Fulson , Freddie King , Albert King and Muddy Waters among others .<br />Clapton's guitar is at the forefront on this album .He does an incredible job with these songs and if you don't agree with people who put Clapton at the top or near the top of the greatest guitar player list  ...this album will have you jumping on the bandwagon .<br />If you like blues ..just buy this . you'll love it.
1932100660|4.0|I've been reading several books by Dr. Joel Fuhrman and Dr. Esselstyn on reversing heart disease, diabetes, etc. Both doctors mention the China Study as an important reference.  This made me want to read it for myself.      The book is written for the layman. It goes into the biology of diseases, the different types of scientific studies, the author's own biography, and the systemic problems in our medical, phamaceutical, political and educational systems.     I'll be fifty next year and I don't want to have to take expensive medications and rely on medical interventions for survival.  This book helps me understand what different foods do to the human body over the long-term.  It has helped me stick to a hearty but nutricious and healthful diet.    If you are looking for a book on nutrition based on peer-reviewed scientic studies by an author who is not afraid to state his views firmly and clearly - this is the book for you.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Though Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One is a blockbuster about teenage wizards, the seventh in the Harry Potter series is more ambiguous and thematically relevant than many movies about adults. The plot will baffle those who have either not seen the previous film or read J. K. Rowling's bestselling books.     The wicked Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) gathers his band of Death Eaters to create a world where muggles (non-magical humans) are subservient to wizards. Voldemort himself echoes Hitler's makeup in that he is half-muggle, and pamphlets strewn throughout the film (including one titled \\"when muggles attack\\") resemble Nazi propaganda.     Meanwhile, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) abandon their final year at the magical school of Hogwarts to embark on a quest to destroy Voldemort. To do this, they must find six horcruxes, objects containing pieces of Voldemort's soul.    Deathly Hallows: Part One, the second to last film, is more appropriate for teenagers than young children. From the barren scenery to the shuddering, downcast portrait of Harry on a wanted poster, a sense of despair pervades the atmosphere. As our three young heroes struggle with uncertainty, their friendship is put to the test.    Seasoned British thespians including Bill Nighy and Helena Bonham Carter have little more than cameos, but most minor characters are well handled. Memorable roles include Alan Rickman's icy Snape, David Thewlis's kind werewolf Lupin (in human form), and Imelda Staunton's creepy interrogator Dolores Umbridge.     Voldemort's hosts, Death Eaters Draco (Tom Felton) and Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), exemplify the crumbling upper class. Humiliated by Voldemort and lower-class thugs, the snobbish Malfoys discover how overturning the social order can negatively affect them.    The odious but helpful house-elf Kreachure, a CGI creation, is marvelously voiced by Simon McBurney. The more heroic house-elf Dobby (Toby Jones) is less successful. He comes across as more cartoonish than inspiring.    But the heart of this film is the trio. Due to the amount of material crammed into each movie, Hermione and Ron have often felt more like sidekicks than complete characters. Here their acting, especially Ms. Watson's, has improved and their conflicts are fleshed out.    We see Hermione's sacrifice as she erases her muggle family's memories in order to protect them. One of the youngest and least powerful in a large family of strong wizards, Ron and his insecurities also emerge, as does his resentment about the relationship between the famous Harry and overachieving Hermione.     Ron and Hermione's unspoken romance is humorous, frustrating, and sweet. While Hermione notes that she is \\"always mad\\" at Ron, she and Harry have a more harmonious and platonic connection. Their closeness is demonstrated in the film's most moving scene, when Harry dances with Hermione. Though not in the book, this moment of joy is a counterpoint to the darkness that takes up so much of the film, and the dance dissolves when they recall the complexity of their situation.    The most creative part of the film, arguably of the entire series, is a curious but fascinating animation of The Tale of the Three Brothers. Nicely read by Ms. Watson, the story of Death's encounter with three brothers is grim, eerie, and hauntingly beautiful.    The film is by no means perfect. It has its share of melodrama, and Alexandre Deslpat's usually lovely score can be laughably over-the-top. Long pauses prolong an already lengthy movie. Part One's abrupt ending isn't particularly satisfying; the audience will have to wait until Part Two for a real conclusion.    Still, it is touching to see the tired and worn triumvirate walk past charred trailer homes as they listen to death tolls on the radio. Hardly older than children, they have to learn that heroism is more tedious than glorious. With only one more film to go, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One manages to be the most emotionally resonant Harry Potter movie yet.

B003L20ICE|4.0|Though The Kids Are All Right never surpasses the threshold of greatness, the film is an intelligent take on familial and romantic relationships.     While Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) struggle with their marriage, their daughter Joni (Mia Wasikowska) faces graduation. Meanwhile, their son Laser (Josh Hutcherson) contacts his biological father, the free spirited Paul (Mark Ruffalo) who donated sperm when he was a young man. As Paul is increasingly intertwined in his \\"children's\\" lives, his role in the family becomes more complex.    There are no villains here. Nic's controlling nature is somewhat overemphasized, but Bening remains sympathetic and humorous. Moore is likewise engaging as the appealing but insecure Jules. Ruffalo is excellent as the laid back Paul. His unexpected reactions to having a family of sorts are fascinating but a tad underdeveloped.    Joni and Laser are perhaps the most well drawn characters. In fact, their stories could have been explored more. The siblings have a close but imperfect connection. They are sarcastic, naive, endearing, and a refreshing departure from unrealistic teenage stereotypes.    The Kids Are All Right touches on everyday questions of patience, disappointment, and love. The movie sometimes strains to find the right amount of quirk, but it's a rare film that is both enjoyable and smart, and thus worth seeing.

0316098337|5.0|I'm sure that somewhere in your home you have a room that measures about 10×10 or 11×11.<br /><br />I want you to imagine this room. Now take out all the windows (but you can have one little skylight).  Put a locked door on it that cannot be open from the inside. Soundproof it. Strip it down to only the bare essentials: a bed, a hotplate, a wardrobe, a table, two chairs, a rug, a bath, a rocker. You can a TV, a few books, a few games. Get comfy. You're going to be spending quite a bit of time here. About seven years in fact.<br /><br />The first few years you'll be alone except for some nightly visits from the person who has put you in this room. (Let's call him Old Nick.) Eventually these nightly visits will result in the birth of a child. Your child. Let's call him Jack. Let's call you Ma.<br /><br />You now have a baby in a windowless locked room. You have to raise this child by yourself, while protecting him, as much as possible, from Old Nick.<br /><br />How would you do it? How would you keep yourself from going insane? How would you provide Jack with as \\"normal\\" a life as possible, considering that the only world he has ever known is this room? And, what do you think would happen if someday, someday, you managed to get out of the room?<br /><br />I believe Emma Donoghue must have went through a thought process like the one I posed to you above, and the results can be found in her brilliantly disturbing yet heartbreakingly beautiful novel ROOM. And, in a genius twist, Donoghue chose to write the novel from the point-of-view of Jack--and this makes all the difference.<br /><br />By writing from 5-year-old Jack's point-of-view, we are spared the unbearable horror of Ma's experience. Instead of being a torture chamber, Room becomes not such a bad place after all. Oh sure, the things Outside that Jack sees on TV seem kind of cool, but they are just pretend. (After all, in Room Jack doesn't feel wind or see clouds or dogs or other children or animals or dirt.)  But Room has plenty to keep Jack busy--from Egg Snake under the bed to Phys Ed time to a seemingly endless variation of word games that Ma has invented. And there is Sundaytreat, which might sometimes even result in chocolate!<br /><br />And most of all, there is Ma. What child doesn't want a mother who is always present, attentive and creative? In Jack's view, Room is a cozy little world of two. Of course, Ma is Gone sometimes, but she always comes back eventually. And yes, Old Nick makes those nightly visits and all kinds of weird creaking sounds, but Jack just hides in the wardrobe. (Ma doesn't like Old Nick to see Jack.) Room is Jack's whole world. It is all he's ever known, and he doesn't really need anything else.<br /><br />So when Ma suddenly starts \\"Unlying\\" and talking about Outside and how they might get there, you can imagine that Jack might not be all that excited. It is a lot for a 5-year-old to take in. It is like someone told you were going to go live on the moon, away from everyone who loves you. Could you go? What would happen if you made it? What would happen to your world?<br /><br />I cannot even tell you how brilliant and engrossing this book is and how riveted I was by Jack's world and, behind it, the darker shadow world that Ma lived in. In some ways, ROOM reminded of Kazuo Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go--in that the protagonists live an almost dream-like existence in a nightmare world, protected and sheltered from the reality of their situation by their innocence and ignorance. Although we see Jack's story unfold in the book, within it and behind it we come to know Ma's story too, which is as horrific and nightmarish as anything I can imagine. Yet by not telling the story from Ma's point of view, Donoghue elevates ROOM to something magical and special and amazing. Yes, this book will disturb you, but it will also uplift you and show you how good can grow from evil, that love can save you, and that what is broken can be put back together again. Read it.

0805086846|5.0|Wow, I don't possess the words to explain how amazing of a book this is. There is a ton of historical information in here and it's very important that everyone understands what happened to the American Indian. But this is not some dry set of historical facts, it is a very interesting and engaging read in its own right. I often struggle with reading historical accounts because they are just so dense and inaccessible, but Dee Brown's work in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is the complete opposite of that. Anyone can pick it up and read it, no matter how much you do or don't know about the history of American Indians or how interested you are generally are in history as a topic. Get this book, you will not be dissapointed.
B00000DOZH|4.0|Sold 7 million copies. Ranked #199 of Rolling Stone's magazine of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Received critical approval. \\"Shazbot, na-nu-na-nu\\" would become the closer of the album, the final words we'd hear from Bon Scott, former AC/DC lead singer (R.I.P.). What a good album. Every track is a rocker.<br /><br />1) Title track is hot. Guitar riffs and everything. Expresses a careless nature in its lyrics.<br />2)\\"Girl's Got Rhythm\\" is an upbeat song. Nice guitar work. I really enjoyed the way it got stronger with its combination of drums and cymbals. 3)\\"Walk All Over You\\" is kinda weird because it makes it seem like it's acceptable to walk over somebody. It starts off slow. The vocals include shouting. Perhaps the worse track on the CD.<br />4)\\"Touch Too Much\\" is a good sexual track that features yelling, especially in the chorus and towards the end of the song with its plea for sensation.<br />5)\\"Beating Around the Bush\\" is the fastest track on the album. The lyrics go pretty fast once in a while. A spectacular finish ends the song with a lot of guitar.<br />6)\\"Shot Down in Flames\\" is about buying pleasure. It's not too interesting. The chorus was bland.<br />7)\\"Get it Hot\\" is fabulous. Great rhythm. It starts off regular paced, has a catchy chorus, and then gets louder; you will enjoy the way it ends with its propelling clashes.<br />8)\\"If You Want Blood (You Got It)\\" sounded pretty well. Another loud track.<br />9)\\"Love Hungry Man\\" is awesome. It's a bit relaxing. It starts off smooth, gets into a catchy chorus, and gets louder. I didn't understand the last screaming lines off it though, and I didn't see much of the lyrics for it.<br />10)\\"Night Prowler\\" lasts a little over 6 minutes. It's a slow track about creeping on someone. My favorite track from \\"Highway to Hell.\\"<br /><br />SHAZBOT, NANU NANU!
0375822429|3.0|This is a great book, but you should be aware that the hardcover edition with the reddish-brown cover and a small picture of Mr. and Mrs. Twit below Dahl's name is a low-quality version of it.  The original illustrations were in delightful color, and these are in black and white.  Also, the paper is of low quality and tears easily -- think mass market paperback paper rather than picture-book paper.
B0033807C2|5.0|I can't beleive that this book, Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian is the final of the series. Now I'm feeling as though something is missing. I wish I had never read the series so that I could discover it all over again.     This has summed up the series really well. All the different twists and turns were entertaining. It is a book you should read when you have nothing to do and don't start reading it at night. You will not want to sleep. It would be a perfect book to become a movie.    I am hoping that Rick Riordan will write another Percy Jackson book because the ending was, no offence or anything, up in the air. That is one of the flaws of some perticular books and like Annabeth says in this book,'Everybody has a flaw which may destroy them.' I certainly could not put this book down. Thankyou Rick Riordan for a wonderful series. You are now one of my favourite authors.    Silverstripe

I really love this song because it certainly resonated with me, and serves as a reminder to me to find happiness regardless of external circumstances. I also enjoyed \\"Vulnerable\\" and \\"Building a Wall\\". \\"Vulnerable is about how someone may appear very strong, stoic, and firm on the outside, but desires the experience of being themselves. \\"Vulnerable\\" also speaks volumes about how important having a partner who allows you to be yourself is very special and important (hence why it is communicated the lyrics, I am vulnerable without you, and how they appreciate what is shared with their partner). I believe that \\"Building a Wall\\" is about someone putting emotional walls around someone they care for in order to not keep out the one they care for but more to give themselves a chance to \\"open up\\" in a cautious and careful manner. All the songs on the cd are good. This cd is so good that I wish that there would have been more than just 11 songs. If there are any songs that you like from the Pet Shop Boys (whether it is one or several of their songs) then please consider giving this collection a chance. This collection puts you in a happy and peaceful mood.
0316019984|5.0|I bought this book for my 4 year old daughter.  It is incredible.  I do not let her handle the book because I want it to last.  I was surprised by how detailed this book is.  Not only are there large pop ups on each page but much smaller ones also.  My favorite part was the last page when my daughter started yelling out all her favorite super heroes she had seen.
B003405MF6|5.0|Another incredibly diverse and innovative work from Jeff. The heavy stuff is sledgehammer heavy and full of emotion.   Jeff is still coming up with fresh melodies. Even my wife took notice asking \\"that's beautiful, who is that?\\"  Easy call for me being a guitar player and a fan of Jeff since the sixties but he transcents genres and tastes just delivering great new music.   There is something for everyone on this release. I myself like it all.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I am a fan of JG, have all his CDs, and saw him on the Awake tour.  However, I find myself reaching for Illuminations in the car, and then passing it over. I like the Italian song.  But, what's up with Galileo?  This CD does not show off Josh's voice.  Listening to the high notes is uncomfortable. I almost gave it 3 stars, but changed it to 2 stars, because I don't want to hear these songs in concert.  I think if I attended a show on the Illuminations tour, I would sit there waiting for his earlier material. Maybe I'll go anyway, just to hear the songs that made me like him so much.
B000084T18|1.0|Red flags should have been raised when this prick bragged about being shot 9 times. He is no where near what he implies he is. I've seen him on water commercials and rapping with Jim Carry! I love gangster rap and it brings a tear to my eye that people classify this as a ganster rap album. It is an over hyped brown log that screams \\"The end is near!\\" With the media and buisnesses bloating at a rapid pace and nobody willing to search for good or even new music I fear that music is dying... this time for real. Pop people ( I refuse to use the term artist or muscian) have always been around but back in the day we didn't have youtube or MTV's ugly little step sister VH-1. If anyone you know is thinking about getting into Hip-Hop and they want to start here don't you dare let them! Refer the Beastie Boys, Tribe Called Quest, De-La Soul or Public Enemy.( If he or she wants somthing a little more modern suggest EARLY Eminem or underground stuff like immortal technique.) My friends I always say that Hip-Hop is not dying just being buried by this drek. Do your part and expand your mind through education or just plain old communicating with an older generation. This must be stopped.  P.S. Lil wayne, rihanna, Kesha and Justin Bieber will drop your I.Q. if you listen to them.
B00005AG7K|1.0|Ok, I have to start off by saying that I truly an an obsessive Beatles fan and have seen this movie literally HUNDREDS of times.  I hate to write a negative review about anything pertaining to them, but if this helps even one person then it's worth it.      I was very excited to see they finally released it on dvd a few years back, so of course I bought it right away.    Do yourself a favor - DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.  I have almost never seen such a poor quality dvd.  It looks as though it is a copy of a copy.  The colors are all off and distorted, and the music doesn't sync with the film in The Fool On The Hill and Blue Jay Way.  I've even tried adjusting my tv settings and nothing helps.  I'm sure I sound extremely picky, but seriously, this copy is just awful.  I put in my VHS from 15 years ago if I want to watch because that is so much better than this DVD.    Let me finish by saying that, like all Beatles films, this one is totally worth your time!!!!!  Just don't buy this version.  Please.  It deserves better treatment than this!!!
160788657X|5.0|This is an action-packed ride from page one.  There are enough twists and misdirections and betrayals to keep the reader guessing.  I listened to the audio and Ron McLarty performed it beautifully.  This will be my holiday present to friends!  Very enjoyable.
0740797719|5.0|(I gave this book my first fully-supported 5 star review I've ever given on amazon.com)    This book replaced at least 2 books on my shelf upon arriving and reading. It takes artists' color theory and describes it in a way that is both approachable and understandable to the beginner and professional alike.    Compared to a lot of people who have written reviews for this book (not only here but on third party sites), I have had a different trail to tread as far as trends in both art and art instruction compared to not only Gurney but artists who were taught from the 1980> . I've been drawing for about 13 years, and started right about the time that digital art was beginning to enter the playing field as a mainstream media/medium (late 90s). An advantage of that is that you were being exposed to both traditional drawing techniques and digital drawing techniques at once, where for today's generation of artists it seems that digital media has nearly swallowed many of the traditional media, and along with them, their techniques.    So, as someone who works about 50/50 with digital and traditional media (albeit leaning more traditional as I get older), this book helped to clarify a lot of very helpful relations between the color and light I was trying to simulate in my images. Not only that, it did it in a language that was not steeped in scientific babble and light theory that I was either skimming over or falling asleep through.    I recommend this to anyone and everyone who paints primarily non-abstract art, especially portrait artists and fantasy/scifi artists. To any professors (or TAs!) who see these reviews, I hope you consider putting this book as required reading in your syllabus. And for those not interested in college, I hope you have the foresight to grab up this edition of the book while it's still in stock.
0061801313|5.0|The first book in this incredibly delicious and amazing series. I have actually read this book twice, once back in 2007 and just recently this past summer since the series began to air on ABC Family. The first book introduces us to these four former best friends. The first novel takes place three year after Ali goes missing. I was completely hooked from the start and you will be as well.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|If you like 8bit or grafic novels, this is for you. If you didn't understand any word from the last sentence, you might not get it.
1404956573|4.0|Ok, overall this was a good value for a gift set when I bought it a few years back.  But it really needed to have the following to be perfect:  1. Ray Parker Jr.'s \\"Ghostbusters\\" music video for the first movie.  2. Bobby Brown's \\"On Our Own\\" music video for the second movie.  3. The trailers for both movies.    I don't even mind the second movie not having a commentary track, though the one for the first movie was rather entertaining.    But I think all basic dvd's should at least have the trailers and any possible music videos.  And good commentary if possible.
B001OMJGD0|3.0|I've seen Superman 3 and 4 before, and I'm familiar with the character through the animated series of the 90s, Fleischer cartoons of the 40s, Smallville and Lois & Clark.Upon first watching the movie I saw a concerted effort to capture the classic Superman images. Superman saving an airplane (Fleischer cartoon and 80s Post-Crisis Supes, Superman lifting a car (a la Action Comics 1), and a forgotten gem from Superman volume 2, issue 174. All the necessary ingredients are here, along with dialog that sounds like it was said by Reeves, Kidder, and Hackman in the classic movies.<br />But wait... they DID say several lines in the first movie. And when did superman ever sound like a whiny kid? He has to convince himself, Lex, and us that, \\"I'm Superman! I'm Superman!\\" when the goons start to kick his butt on the Kryptonite continent. Furthermore there is no monumental battle at the end. Lex is stuck on an island, Supes lives, and Lois' son is also Superman's? I'll admit that was an intriguing twist-L&S have a son, but where could you go with that idea? This is why it'd be a while before the next Superman movie-to cleanse the palette of disappointed fanboys and moviegoers who find more excitement from Marvel's properties.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|I was really impressed with this cd.  I love that Nicki marches to her own tune, it's extremely refreshing.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|Some reviews here and elsewhere say 12th century.  The movie is based upon 1199 AD England, and some espionage and undermining deceit purveyed by a French band of spies.  Russell Crowe is an excellent actor.  Cate Blanchett is a fine actress.  But this story tries to spin off the traditionally loved and longed for story of Robin Hood, and tells a slightly outside-the-box version of how it all may have began.  The character of Robin is a common archer in the Crusades who practices hosting some goofy carnival style game when he's not fighting as a soldier; the pea and 3 walnut shell halves con game.  Fate and luck gives Robin an opportunity to become a knight by appearance, and wouldn't you know, it turns out he probably used to be one anyway.  Robin saves the day in a siege by France, and the King gets jealous of Robin's popularity and makes him an outlaw, banned from what he earned.<br />The most this movie has ever received for a rating is PG-13, and the director's cut is no different.  Could have been made sultrier really easy, or made far more FX gorier.  Either or both would have been a great help.  As it is, it comes across as plain dry white toast.  The cast was stellar enough.  The sets and costumes were epic and accurate enough.  But the movie tries too hard to stay family oriented; politically correct.  Let's have some good old cussing, some female nudity, and some skulls getting cleaved or just downright severed.  Or we can just prance around looking serious and tough, and never really do anything.  Kind of like a professional conference for knights of the Dark Ages, 12th/13th century England.  Meh.  Was this movie intended exclusively for the pre-teen?<br />The only thing this movie had that was really cool was the engraved words on a sword's hilt, \\"rise and rise again\\" on one side, and on the other side, \\"until lambs become lions\\" which was covered by a cord wound tightly around the handle.  It means never give up for the cause of liberty, never, ever give up. Rise, and rise again, until the docile lambs become conquering lions.<br />But as big of a deal as is made of the sword, it never goes anywhere in this film, and is the most disappointing and blatantly sequel oriented thing in celluloid I've seen for over a decade.  If this is going to be a series of movies, they need to say so up front.  Marketing strategies get tiresome when the fans are so unashamedly exploited, if there are already plans in the works for sequels.<br />I haven't spoiled the whole movie, go ahead and watch it.  But I predict you'll wish you waited to buy one used if you plan to own the DVD.  Unless you collect Robin Hood movies and have the Douglas Fairbanks version (1922), the Errol Flynn version (1938), the Sean Connery version (1976), the Kevin Costner version (1991), the Disney animated version where Robin Hood is a fox and Little John is a bear (1973), the Patrick Bergen version (1991), the Cary Elwes version (1993), or who knows how many others, then go ahead and buy this DVD too.  But if you're just a fan of Russell Crowe or Cate Blanchett, you might want to wait until you can buy your DVD here on Amazon as a used but in new or very good condition version.  Their roles in this version needed to go further.  Why America is going backwards in time with tighter restrictions upon censorship of entertainment, is hard to understand.  It isn't a high school documentary history lesson for crying out loud.  Let's go ahead and portray some genuine realism in how people talked and actually lived.  No wonder it didn't take in a king's ransom at the box office.  This 2010 version should have came out in the 1950's.  It would have fit better for how much restraint was exercised; and yet even from that perspective, I've seen more violence in a John Wayne Movie.  Don't tell me this Robin Hood movie was researched and accurate.  St. Louis, Missouri in 2010 AD must seem like a good place to raise a family and retire to the reviewers who say this movieis accurate for the time period.<br />2 stars from me.  Lucky it got that.  I'd rather watch Shrek, and I'm over 50 yrs old.the time period.  2 stars from me.  Lucky it got that.  I'd rather watch Shrek, and I'm over 50 yrs old.
0756665949|2.0|I love LOST. I loved it more than any other show on TV at the time, and evangelized it to all my friends. I'm one of the fans who would paus live TV, dissect the details, ponder the blast door map, think about the literary parallels, print out Dharma beer can labels for my LOST parties, and more. You can see where this is going.    I say all this because I know my show. I got this encyclopedia hoping it would be a one-stop destination for reliving that feeling I got from the show for six years. Sadly, the book is full of typos, bad edits (multiple entries have redundant sections where the wording is either exactly the same or almost), and some of the content is very interpretive.  For example, when the book talks about Mother and Man in Black, it completely ignores the fact that Mother said \\"Thank you\\" when MiB killed her. Why did she say this? The book remains silent on it, and glosses over this fact rather quickly. Is it possible that Mother had planned it the entire time, and that MiB somehow did her a favor by killing her? Is it possible that Mother performed the longest con ever, starting with appearing as the ghost of Isabelle, planting that seed of doubt in MiB's mind about who his real mother was, causing him to doubt and to want to be free? Perhaps she was the Monster to begin with... How else could we explain an entire village destroyed? Perhaps she just wanted to be free, and MiB killing her by sword without her saying a word was the only way she'd be free of her horrible position as the first Monster. Just a theory, but some speculation is BEGGED by the \\"Thank you.\\" Again, this type of speculation is completley missing in the book, and rather, is summed up in a few short sentences. Many other characters and plot points are glossed over haphazardly. Read Abbadon's section and think about how mysterious he was in the show. It's half a page in the book.    I returned this book, very disappointed.
B0000C6K09|3.0|Appreciated the fast shipping, but the CD cover was cracked in two different areas.  This is a gift so I was sure to purchase a \\"like new\\" item... either the description wasn't honest, or the item was damaged when shipped. Ug.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I've enjoyed The Camel Club books (and think that they should be read in order for maximum enjoyment) and this was the best one yet. I'm usually fairly good at parsing mysteries and thrillers in that I guess a good deal of the time some of the devices and plot twists; this book was impossible! Just as I thought I had a read on where it would go it would \\"zig\\" or \\"zag\\" (to borrow the author's expression) in a totally different direction. I think, too, that it is a bit of a harbinger of things to come in that it underscores the serious consequences of too much split bureaucracy each scrambling for turf. We are not far from a time when \\"need to know\\" will become a terrible and potentially lethal handicap in managing anything from governments to environment to financial situations. There is much I would say about what I loved about this book, but most of it would be spoilers and this is a book that you will NOT want to put down, so prepare for an escapist weekend and a bit of eye strain! Well DONE!!!
0810997827|5.0|I bought this for my 7-year-old brother after reading all the positive reviews, and he loves them! It's been a week and he's on the second book now. I live away from home, but my mom tells me that he used to see reading as a task, now he's enjoying it! I haven't read the books myself, but apparently they're very entertaining, each time my brother reads something funny, he'd be super excited to tell my mom all about it.

0451205766|5.0|The Godfather is the story of organized crime in the 1940's which revolves around the Corleone family. Don  Corleone is the head of a New york family. The Don is shot by Solozzo's men. Solozzo who is a rival family then kidnaps one of Don's advisors, Tom Hagen and tries to make him force Don's eldest son, Sonny to agree to sell drugs, but the plan goes wrong when Sollozzo finds out that Don Corleone is still alive, who was shot.   The godfather is a type of book that should be read by everyone from all ages. The English is bit  complex, however it is not hard to understand what is going on. This book is very much a history book. It shows how Italians were back in the 40's. This book shows family loyalty, and how true gang warfare looks like.   I do not believe the Godfather should be in the academic reading list because of how kids may portray the story. Especially in high school,kids would not completely understand the parts in the story and morals. However i encourage everyone to read this piece of writing. It teaches us a whole lot of how the world works.

0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult's My Sister's Keeper is a heart-wrenching story about a girl named Anna who was born to donate blood and tissue to Kate, her elder sister diagnosed with APL at the age of two. For years, Anna donated pieces of herself through more and more dangerous and invasive procedures to impede Kate's steady loss of life.    She's always been the sister of the cancer victim, never Anna Fitzgerald. Now that she's growing up, unable to date or make friends because of Kate's condition, Anna starts to question her parents' right to force her to donate to Kate. She sells her most prized possession and collects all the money she can ($136.87) to hire a lawyer. The lawyer she chooses, Campbell Alexander, accepts her case for the pro-bono publicity and prepares to sue her Anna's parents for medical emancipation.    The judge assigned to Anna's case gives Julia Romano, the guardian ad litem responsible for deciding the best course of action for Anna, a week to get to know the family. Jodi Picoult shows each character's point of view through diary-like entries and flashbacks, revealing marital tensions between Anna's parents, love-hate relations between Julia and Campbell, Anna and Kate's brother Jesse's pyromania, and a deep connection between Anna and Kate.    The week starts out rough, with Anna faltering under her mother's pressure and the weight of Kate's illness and Campbell struggling with his feeling for Julia and his mysterious illness. Gradually, as Julia investigates the Fitzgerald family's living conditions, the case becomes easier for Anna to accept, harder for her mother to fight as opposing counsel, and more tense for all other parties involved. As the date of the trial approaches, Anna's family starts to fall apart, each member expecting the worst.    My Sister's Keeper is the only book I've read with such an interesting style of first-person narrative. The ups and downs in the plot, splashes of comedy and trauma, and romantic subplots make this book a must-read for high school students and adults alike, especially with frequency that fairness is brought into question as we get older.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban:  talent, charm, a voice that makes you know that there is a God! Do I sound like a fan? LOL. Truthfully , the album is BEAUTIFUL.  The orchestrations, choice of songs, songs in English, Italian, Spanish and French, his hit solo \\"YOU RAISE ME UP\\" (which always reduces me to tears!) his rendition of Edith Piaf 's beautiful\\" Hymme a l'amour \\": the entire album is FANTASTIC!!  The cd also carries a booklet with all the lyrics to each song. I enjoyed the foreign songs so much, that I went on line to a translation site to learn what the songs were about! THAT is how much I enjoy this album! Enough said; buy this album if you love beauty in your life! GO JOSH!
0553381687|5.0|When a book has 1200 5-star reviews, there's very little else to be said than what's in this review's title. I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Martin's style - and can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series.<br /><br />Happy Reading!
B002Z58GQI|5.0|Well I bought the older model of this USB drive in the 4gb size about 3 years ago or so. It lived in my pocket for at least 2 years until it was full and I got a new one. The two years of wear in in my pocket did nothing more than completely take the transend label off of it and all of teh info along with scratching the heck out of it. It is one tough little usb stick. It survived being soaked mulitple times and is still in decent shape. It still works great and looks kinda new-ish. the transfer speeds are reasonable for the price, i got it for $15. Oh also it came with a nice lanyard that helps keep track of it, otherwise it is so small it could be lost easily. I replaced it with a sandisk cruzer and have to say i liked this one better just because it was smaller and didn't seem as fragile. The only problem I can see with it right now is that teh usb part that plugs in is a little loose, but in no danger of breaking off. Overall it is a cheap little usb drive that gets the job done. Also I never installed the transend software, so I don't know anything about it.

B003X2O6MK|1.0|Note***  I couldn't post this review without rating it. I don't want rate this one. So my rating is actually 0 (zero) stars.    This album is not \\"the good life\\" and pop culture music. He's facing his demons unafraid of the outcome on this one.     The dark, depressing, grimy, uncomfortable sounds are refreshing. Reminds me of Rza's Digi Snacks and Wu-tang's \\"8 diagrams\\" as far as the slow tempo and style. Speaking of Wu, Rza co-produced with Ye' on \\"Dark Fantasy\\" and \\"So Appalled\\". The mood and lyrical content are relevant to people struggling to feed their families today, and how hard work amounts to nothing nowadays as oposed to the promise of prosperity in the past; politics; how people see this culture outside of the U.S.; religion, etc. (Underground music)      You decide for yourself.    If you want something to jam to: Not for you.  If you are looking for something bad to say about Kanye: You'll get that.  If you like the realness in Rapp: You'll enjoy the honesty. If you understand the lyrics and feel it, the music starts to sound good.
1400052173|5.0|I seldom read non-fiction, this was an exception.  It was well thought out,  I loved the story; it made Henrietta, her family, the scientific community real.  It was told in a warm, non judgemental way.  Thank you Rebecca for taking the time and the risks.......  I feel like a better person for knowing Henrietta's story.
0783240236|4.0|The movie was very entertaining and displayed Hichcock at his best. It may have seemed far-fetched to have birds attacking enmasse. However, individual birds have been known to attack humans during the nesting season. Besides the excellent performances by the leads, the supporting actors played their part as well. I appreciated the supporting feature covering the making of the movie. It was quite fascinating.

B003UZ46DY|5.0|I've been a fan of Incubus for years, and I'm happy to say that this album has reached a new level for Boyd.  Every song is good, my favorites are tracks, 'Dance While the Devil Sleeps,' \\"Spectral Tiger,\\" and 'Mirror of Venus.' But I think the biggest reason I like this album are Boyd's lyrics.  What I see in the lyrics are Boyd's inner journey, and vocalizing of his meditations.  Some of my favorite lines, are stuck in the belly of fate (see Tibetan Wheel of Fate) or \\"a spectral tiger born, with beautiful stripes and porcelain teeth,\\" (spectral tiger is a Asian and Mayan myth). There are many other references to myth and the metaphysical. Truly inspiring album.
0440241901|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down til I was finished. I did not want this book to end! I just bought another book by SK and I am hoping that it is just as good!
1579128149|5.0|This wonderful book will bring chemistry alive, just as knowing the people involved makes stories about them so much more interesting.  Those chemical formulas will mean so much more once you've met the elements up close, and know something of their quirky characters, like that Lithium and Sodium are the only two metals that float, or that Alumnimum doesn't rust but does oxidize.  Yes, there is technical detail, too.  You'll also learn about the radioactive materials built into essential household appliances.  Anyway, it is full of cool stuff that I didn't know.
B002ZG98XW|4.0|Disney Studios always put their curious \\"joyfull\\" stamp on their family movies and Secretariat is no exception. If they have to re-write history a bit; they do. Horse-lovers know the real story and, of course, know the ending. It's just the \\"getting there\\" that takes a bit of suspension of belief.  We are told that the farm is in desperate financial straits though Riva Ridge who won the 1972 Derby for Mrs. Tweedy is NEVER mentioned even though he was still racing in 1973. Secretariat was never an underdog. He won Horse of the Year as a 2-year-old! Secretariat lost his last Derby prep to Angle Light though the film implies that Sham was the winner and that noble horse's trainer, Frank Martin; was portrayed as a big-mouthed villain...which he was not. He was simply the trainer of the second-best horse of 1973.  To the film's credit, the racing scenes are superb. The Preakness (jewel #2 in the Triple Crown) was shown as it took place on TV. I have no complaint with that as Big Red's stunning move on the first turn could not likely be duplicated.  Mrs. Tweedy's turn as \\"horse-whisperer\\" was sheer nonsense...but what the heck; this is not a biography.  Secretariat's final stretch run in The Belmont Stakes was treated very cleverly from a cinematic point of view but the musical choice of a Biblical version of \\"Oh Happy Day\\" defies description. It makes no sense at all.  For all its historical faults, flights of pure imaginiation; Secretariat is a most enjoyable film. The good guys win; the bad guys lose.  Old Walt Disney would have loved it...I did too.
B000AP04FG|4.0|There's no shortage of screen chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in this action-filled romantic comedy from \\"Fair Game\\" director Doug Liman. In fact, the gunplay, fisticuffs and chases remain secondary to Brad and Angelina's considerable star power - a rarity in today's cineplex environment. \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" (2005) is refreshingly old-fashioned in the classic Hollywood tradition.

B000002LUB|5.0|After the departure of Ronnie James Dio in 1982, Black Sabbath descended into commercial irrelevance, revolving-door lineups, and total loss of musical direction.  This album comes right in the middle of five mediocre albums with Tony Martin, following the ridiculous hair metal-influenced Eternal Idol, Headless Cross and Tyr, and preceding the mediocre grunge/alt-metal inspired Cross Purposes and Forbidden.  Somehow, for a brief moment in 1992 the band was able to regain their focus and sense of purpose to make what I consider the last Black Sabbath album to truly sound like Black Sabbath.  Dio brings back the vocal virtuosity that made Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules such great albums, but what is even more exciting about Dehumanizer is the music.  Having Geezer and Vinny Appice back in the band clearly helped bring Sabbath out of the hair-metal stupor of 86-90s - the riffs are heavy, tight, and evil, often evoking the sludginess of 70s Sabbath.  There is clearly an effort to bring the band's sound up to date, but this is achieved without sacrificing melody or tempo (which I considered to be the greatest failing of \\"The Devil You Know\\").  I recommend this album for everybody who likes Black Sabbath, metal, or rock music in general, and especially to anybody who has enjoyed Black Sabbath's work from 1970-1982 but has been turned off by their later direction.  Yes, even the Tony Martin albums have grown on me, but they are really an acquired taste, and I feel that they have very little in common with the Black Sabbath of the 70s.  Dehumanizer, on the other hand, will not disappoint fans of the classic Sabbath.  What a shame that this promising reunion was cut short.

B0040UAYI4|1.0|So, I ordered this thing because I'm a PC gamer and all of my friends were begging me to buy Black Ops for the PS3.  I watched all the video reviews and read a ton as well.  Everything looked perfect so I ordered it and was super excited to own consol gamers with this converter.  I plugged it in and set it up accordingly.  The first thing that aggravated me was it does not acknowledge the middle mouse wheel up or down.  So if you prefer to switch weapons or throw grenades this way it's not possible.  The second thing I noticed once I plugged it in was if you use the right mouse button to see down our sights this doesn't work.  You have to hold it down on the ps3 so there is no toggle hold.  In other words when your holding down the right mouse button it goes in and out of the sight.  Quiet annoying.  Third thing, to hit and hold a button to pick up objects, forget about it, doesn't work either.  I didn't try this with any other game except Black Ops, but trust me.  If your a PC gamer and your use to things working perfectly this is not for you.  Very disappointed.  Now I'm out $120.00 dollars for this set up and about to spend another $60.00 for the pc version.  Maybe I'll try to get use to the sticks.  Hope this helped.<br />Thanks
B004AQR29C|1.0|Wow...I went into this movie expecting a thin plot and some fun explosions.  All I got was explosions.    With the exception of one scene with Mickey Rourke, the whole thing was a waste of time and money.  It felt like they didn't even try to work on a convincing story.

B0041KKYDI|5.0|I vaguely remembered the story of Aron Ralston from around 2003; he was the hiker who fell into a crevice and was trapped by a boulder that clamped his arm in place.  After 5 days or so, Ralston finally freed himself by severing his own arm.  It was a story of courage, but it also make me wonder why Ralston was on his own without having let anyone know where he was going.<br /><br />Director Danny Boyle's wonderful new film 127 HOURS explores both sides of the story, resulting in a deeply felt character study that is riveting, exciting and paced like an action-thriller.  While much of the movie is, by necessity, confined to a single location...it never feels claustrophobic or static.  In fact, the film soars.<br /><br />Boyle introduces Ralston as a happy-go-lucky young adult, apparently economically comfortable who is charming, helpful and utterly winning.  He's also self-centered in the way only young adults with few economic or family cares can be.  He does what it occurs to him to do.  He's smart & funny.  He's enamored of the great outdoors and of pushing himself physically.<br /><br />And when his accident befalls him, those qualities help him survive and help him to self-reflect.  He's trapped in a deep hole with just a few supplies.  He in a deeply uncomfortable position and he's pretty clear-headed about just how much trouble he's in.  His intelligence allows him to access his dire circumstances.  His humor allows him to be bemused by himself and to leave some scathing videos of self-assessment behind.  Boyle shows us the physical situation Ralston is in...but where the film truly succeeds is by showing us the psychological journey he takes.  The two work hand in hand.  As Ralston grows weary, tired, hungry and very thirsty, his mind begins to play tricks on him.  In many ways, the film takes the old clich&eacute; of \\"his life passed before his eyes\\" and shows how Ralston's several days of dire, boring confinement allow him to see his life and to reflect on his successes and failures.  He never weeps with despair over his fate...he is more bemused by his own hubris.<br /><br />All of this is presented with tremendous visual flair.  First, Boyle shows us the country...gorgeous and empty.  You can see why a young man would want to bike and hike and climb all over this natural playground.  He also edits with a feverish pace (not MTV-style editing, where you are asked to notice it, but in an organic way).  The use of color is impressive as well... Boyle has always had a knack of using filmstock and processing to help him tell his stories.  SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE showed this on a grand scale...127 HOURS on a modest but equally impressive level.<br /><br />But I've save the best for last.  Boyle has the impressive skills of the immensely likeable and instinctive James Franco in the role of Aron.  He has a disarming ease in his performance.  When we see the less impressive sides of Ralston, we never cease to care about this young man, because Franco has infused him with believable life and enthusiasm.  It seems like a simple performance...but it's actually loaded with complexity.  But Franco never labors over his acting...it seems to flow.<br /><br />Everyone knows that Ralston amputated his arm, and those brief scenes are as brutal and hard to watch as anything I've seen on film.  But they are NOT exploitative in any way.  By the time this comes around, we're actually ROOTING for Ralston to succeed in his grim task.  And the film is more about the journey leading us to this moment than the moment itself.<br /><br />127 HOURS is a delightful surprise.  Boyle is an outstanding filmmaker and Franco is a very capable actor...but they have taken the elements of what would sound like a rather lurid \\"TV movie-of-the-week\\" subject and turned it into a life-affirming, even uplifting drama.  It's a must-see..  He never weeps with despair over his fate...he is more bemused by his own hubris.    All of this is presented with tremendous visual flair.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|All I can say is WOW!  The picture and sound quality of this release are breathtaking.  Right from the first opening scene where Julie Andrews is  twirling on the mountain top as the camera moves in, you can actually make out tiny yellow and pink flowers in the grass!!!  The images are so sharp that the actual grain of the film can be seen.  This really makes you feel as though you are watching a film and not a video transfer.  I own several versions of this film (VHS, DVD & the old Laser Disc) and I can say this is a major leap forward.  The extras on disc two are quite nice.  I really enjoyed the bits about the technical aspect of restoring the film for hi def. I wished they had longer segments on that.      I did read the very few 1 star comments, most of which were from people who had yet to purchase the product.  It DOES indeed come with DVD and Blu Ray--this seems to be confusing people.  It comes with both.  Also someone posted being disappointed in the picture quality.  This is confusing as I wonder if this person actually watched it on a hi def TV or, like a friend of mine, was confused and not hooked up his blu ray player and HDTV using a HDMI cable?  I wonder. Either way, the film is amazing to look at in this format.  A large thanks to the talented people who restored such a precious piece of our cinema history.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|This is an outstanding collection of Christmas music.  The arrangements...her voice...just perfection!  If you love older Christmas music, then this is for you.  If you aren't familiar with some of the songs on here and are hesitant, just think, if you love Annie, you will LOVE this collection.  Her signature sound is evident throughout.  This is by far my favorite Christmas music collection to date!

Plus, it's very easy to use some of the ideas with substitute foods. For once, my picky child is eating all the food on her plate without a complaint. Crazy. Anyway, this stuff is also fun to make.

031603438X|5.0|Rolling Stones is a group that's been around since the Beatles, and was lucky enough to stand the test of time and keep touring well into their current ages. Unlike the Beatles, however, it was known for its more rebellious sound and scandal-laden past--the strange death of Brian Jones, numerous drug arrests, and erratic behavior. Throughout the group's journey, only two men were there from the very beginning--Mick Jagger an Keith Richards. And one of them has finally opened the pandora's box.     \\"Life\\" by Keith Richards is a pretty hefty tome that chronicles Richards' journey from the wreck that was post WWII London, to the glory of the Rolling Stones and his unique life. Unlike Jagger, Richards is generally known as the madman of the group--not least because of his famed drug past, which is why it's symbolic that Richards' book starts with the group's drug arrest while touring U.S. in the seventies. The drunk judge and their lawyer's connections let the Rolling Stones off the hook that time, though not all arrests ended as well. From this. Richards parlays into his childhood in unsavory neighborhoods and his meeting with Mick Jagger on a train station, where their shared passion for music cemented their friendship. Richards was a big fan of musicians like Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters, and was impressed by Jagger's record collection. After attending a British art college where not much hope was held for the school's graduates, Richards expected to be drafter into the army and serve two years--but his initial plans were interrupted when the Vietnam War slowed down and Richards was not drafted after all. Having a lot of time on his hands, Richards decided to pursue his passion--and after numerous stints in the local bars and sharing an apartment with Mick Jaggers et al, there was no turning back. During this time, Richards and his buddies are pretty much unemployed and play mostly for free, feeling elated at the rare gigs that pay. They have trouble having ends meet, but, as Richards states, \\"hate money,\\" and play mostly for the thrill. Jagger attends the London School of Economics, until he decides to quit as well. And that is when the crazyness of the group's success begins.     As a celebrity biography, this book really stood out for me. First of all, it's very candid. The huge page count and small text seem to emphasize that Richards does NOT want to leave anything out. The numerous scandals are described scene-by-scene, as is Richards' eventual disenchantment with Jagger and numerous relationships. Richards even includes his various diary entries and letters from pertinent periods, including the group's beginnings. Overall, a very candid bio that should satisfy not only fans of the group, but anyone who enjoys reading celebrity tell-alls.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I saw this movie the first time in 2005, and LOVED it. I enjoyed this movie so much that I decided to read the book, and to be honest I'm wasn't a fan of classical romance or any kind of romance ( and I'm girl) but that all changed after P & P. I love Matthew Macfadyen as Mr.Darcy.He was born to play Mr.Darcy.And Keira Knightley is a excellent actress and she did a superb job as Elizabeth. I recommend this movie to everyone I know because it made a great impression on me.This movie really makes you feel so many emotions, you'll cry, laughed, and at the end you will truly believe in true love.           P.S.: I tried to watch the 1995 BBC P & P but in my opinion the actors portraying the characters are so bland and boring, but again that's MY opinion.

B003UYUR0G|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch.  It's obviously not a work of art, but it had lots of action, good effects, likable characters, stunning visuals, and some good humor.  It was also a pretty clean movie, which is always nice as a lot of movies nowadays are too sexual, gory, or crude to watch with the family.  If you consider yourself a film connoisseur, you'll probably hate it.  If you like fun adventure movies that aren't too serious (i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars), you should enjoy this film.<br /><br />Oh, and the blu-ray transfer is awesome! Best way to watch movies at home!
B002ZG98CS|4.0|It is a movie full action and the story line is rather simple. Fun to watch if you are mentally stress up. It is Danny's first lead role.

Please do not watch with kids as there are a decent number of nude takes.

0307346617|5.0|This book is most definitely one of the greatest pieces of fiction that I have read in a while. The literary work of Max Brooks as well as the format of the book make a wonderful combination that cannot be beaten. His use of multiple characters across the world conversing in the aftermath of the greatest threat mankind has ever seen is brilliant. I thoroughly enjoyed the detail and effort that the book emanated from page 1. Furthermore, the sheer amount of emotion toward the human race will keep any reader interested until they reach the end. A required reading book for any fan of apocalyptic scenarios and a great read for everyone else.
1575666286|5.0|The book is very informative.  My daughter has been having migraine/cluster headaches for 6 months.  So she decided that she would try the Gerson Therapy to see if it would help her headaches.  The juicing regimen and dietary suggestions that are promoted in the book have helped her to reduce the headaches intensity and frequency.  She has been on the regime for about a month.  So in just a month she has seen results.  The book recommends very expensive juicers that are cost prohibitive for our family so we just purchased the Jack La Lanne Juicer.  It is fabulous!  Furthermore, the book recommends using only organic vegetables, again this is cost prohibitive for our family so we wash the vegetable with a vegetable cleaner. I highly recommend the book because its focus is on assisting the body to heal itself naturally.

B003Z0D4S2|3.0|I had to read the last Larsson novel.  I had to know what happened to the characters.  I needed closure... and for the most part I got it.  I find Larsson's style intriguing.  I get frustrated by the way he rambles on about seemingly unimportant details and events, and yet fascinated, at the same time, that the rambling often takes me somewhere I didn't expect to go.  I enjoyed the book, but it wasn't my favourite in the series.  The rambling bothered me the most in this book, and I am still left with that feeling of wanting more.

I'm tired of the noise making and she's just NOT A LYRICAL artist. She thought she could surpass LIL KIM's debut album (or any other album of hers), but the fact is Hardcore did double platinum a few months after it dropped and every album thereafter, went platinum. This toilet tissue she calls an album hasn't even charted yet on Billboard. So, sorry, but she needs to think about what she should call herself, because she's NOT HIP-HOP and hip-hop is many things, but it's not this.

Their greatness lays on  their capacity of keep on creating music according to their time.     Kid Rock's Born Free is a mature sample of his creativity, he blends his musical influences on every song, he has awesome lyrics and he's not trying to erase his past by any mean. You'll see him for sure playing his old tunes and the new ones at his concerts, and it will be a great experience for us to watch!

I can certainly see a movie made of this story that might mirror the likes of 'Rebecca'.

B001FB5634|4.0|THE ROAD, Cormac McCarthy's disturbing post-apocalyptic novel, created for the reader a brittle, cold, callous, terrifying place, almost without dialogue, relying on just word painting.  In many ways Joe Penhall's adaptation for the screen obeys that impulse - the film is fairly quiet, allowing the horror to work its way into our minds.  Unfortunately the film thinks we cannot sustain the tension of the impossibly bleak scenario, so there are flashback moments that actually contain color - moments that focus on Charlize Theron as the wife and mother of the main characters in an attempt to bring some visual relief.  Otherwise director John Hillcoat seems to fully understand McCarthy's vision and does a fine job taking us through it.<br /><br />The story is simple; a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) have been wandering the blighted surface of the planet earth after the near complete destruction of life.  There are others whom they meet, some 'good guys' and some 'bad guys', but the overall force behind walking the barren planet is the need for food and warmth for survival and to avoid the possibility of cannabalism.  The man and boy walk with 'fire' inside, always heading South where they hope to find warmth.  Along the way they meet others, also without names: and old man (Robert Duvall), a thief (Michael Kenneth Williams), a gang member (Garret Dillahunt), and a family - Guy Pierce and Molly Parker.  The story has an ending - or does it?  We are left in medias res with the question of survival uncertain.<br /><br />Though given the fact that he has few lines of dialogue, Viggo Mortensen manages to create a credible father and committed survivor and his acting is astonishingly fine.  Kodi Smit-McPhee likewise manages to make us believe in his character and may just become a fine actor as an adult.  The audience for this film may be narrow: few, in today's tense world situation, may wish to see the possible outcome of our behavior as custodians of this planet.  But this is a book that should have been written and a film that deserves to be seen to remind us of alternatives.

B000AGTPUU|5.0|I find it hard to believe that anyone who has watched this with their children can not love this movie. There was one review that stated it was \\"creepy\\". I don't think so, I think it is just tapping into the magic of Christmas, is it really more creepy then the 3 ghosts that visit Scrooge? Again it is suppose to have a magic feel and magic is usually considered super-natural. Others said that the charecters are cold and cynical, I do not find that to be so. They are not so mushy and lovey as so many other kids specials, but personally I like that better. It makes them more human, and more realistic.<br /><br />I think this movie captures the imaginations of children and adults, and I am not someone who likes to watch much TV. My husband and I both enjoy watching this with our kids. It gets us into the Christmas spirit for sure. Most importantly, since it's a kids movie, our kids love it.
B0044E9LW6|4.0|I'm a huge Dio fan. I missed the Holy Diver tour but went to The Last in Line, Sacred Heart, Dream Evil and the Lock up the Wolves tour.<br />This CD just arrived from Amazon so I ripped it open and put it on the player.<br />I was immediately disappointed with the audio quality. As another reviewer put it - it all sounds a bit muffled.<br />I imagine there are better unreleased recordings than this out there but at the same time, it's hard to beat for the price of this double-disc set.<br /><br />Audio quality issues aside, Ronnie is really at the top of his game on this set. His voice is just amazing and the band gels well. It really brings back memories. Plus, I have a new appreciation for a lot of the songs. In my teens I hadn't listened to all that much Black Sabbath and Rainbow. Now that I know more of the songs like Children of the Sea and Stargazer, its great to hear them live.<br /><br />Anyways, I recommend the CD to get a live glimpse of the greatest voice metal has ever heard, at his best.<br />Unfortunately, his voice is a bit mired in a bad recording. But as my review title says - Any Dio is better than no Dio.

I have to say both my husband and I were disappointed. It was amusing enough, but did not deserve the hype. My husband and I had the same semi-confused expression on our faces at the end of the movie. It was detached and weird, and not in a good way. The plot was great and touching, but the movie itself seemed scattered to us. I will say it was worth watching with our son, it was not worth paying for. I'm glad I didn't buy the movie first. If you catch it on TV for free go for it, this is a movie I suggest watching before buying to make sure it is worth it to you.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|Horrible attempt at the classic. I thought this would be good for all the actors in it and it was VERY disappointing. Couldn't even finish it, it was so bad. Half the time you can't understand what Jim Carey's character is even saying.
B000J103PC|5.0|i read the book which isn't very much like the movie but i love the movie and the book just as much!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I've played some mystery/puzzle games before but this one REALLY take the cake. Out of all the M rated games so far released, (this being the 11th M rated game out for the DS system) this is really hard to put down once you started playing.     The game itself is a mixture of a graphical novel and a \\"escape the room\\"/solve puzzles. So if you hate reading, puzzles, or math in general, I would stay away from the game. However, if you enjoy complex puzzles, memorable characters, great story lines I would definitely pick this game up.     What make this game even better is once you \\"finished\\" the game, you can play back through the game and have a completely different ending. Which really adds onto the replay value of this game and no two endings are the same!    I would like to warn parents though, this game is rated by ESRB as M for Mature for a reason. There is blood (tons of blood and a very detailed description of said blood), drug reference, strong language (and when I mean strong language, STRONG LANGUAGE! Not just the f-word is being thrown around), suggestive themes, and of course, violence.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|I LIKED THIS MOVIE EVEN THOUGH I NEVER READ THE COMIC BOOK    IT WAS A WESTERN WITH A BIT OF SUPERNATURAL THROW IN
B003UESJGU|5.0|I went and saw this movie with my girlfriend this week and I have to say this was a beautiful movie. We laughed, she cried, and it was just a well put together movie. I was shocked it was actually a second choice because for colored girls wasn't showing at the time, but looking at it I'm glad we saw this instead of another movie. I'm still looking forward to for colored girls though. In all this is a great movie and I think all should watch it.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|\\"When the dead walk, our only hope is each other.\\" is one of the show's promotional tag lines. Except that sometimes we're a pretty crummy bunch of folks. AMC premiered THE WALKING DEAD on Halloween 2010 and breathes a different sort of life into the zombie apocalypse sub-genre. Robert Kirkman - from whose comic book series this telecast is adapted - won't be rolling over his grave. First, because he's not dead. Second, because AMC does his baby justice in terms of capturing tone and themes. The first episode (\\"Days Gone Bye\\") drew in eight million viewers. That means it's a hit, yo.<br /><br />As in Robert Kirkman's comic book, it's not about the zombies, not really. The zombie infestation serves as the bloodcurdling backdrop, yep. But the focus is on human drama, the highs and lows that man will get up to when the world ends around him. Sheriff's Deputy Rick Grimes is the central figure, mild-mannered and competent and clearly our point-of-view character. After surviving getting shot in the line of duty, Rick wakes up in an abandoned hospital, and we won't get into whether this sequence was ripped off from 28 DAYS LATER or not, because, really, THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS did the hospital wakey-wakey bit first, and did it decades ago. Rick soon enough learns of the zombies, or as the father and son duo who takes him in calls them: the \\"walkers.\\" Horrified at what the world has become, Rick nevertheless sets out to find his family. It's what you and I would do, right? He heads for Atlanta, rumored to be the site of a refugee camp, except that the rumor is all kinds of wrong. But if you weren't yet certain that Rick was the \\"hero\\" of the piece, then that iconic image of him on his horse wandering down a desolate highway probably did it. Positively John Wayne, that was.<br /><br />It helps that the special effects and the make-up work are so very good. You don't struggle at all with the believability of the shambling revenants. So the bits with the zombies will satisfy the goreheads. But this show, much as in Kirkman's comic book, explores the human condition as it tracks those few humans left. Inevitably, values will be compromised, that underlying social contract sidestepped. If this show follows the course of Kirkman's arc, you're in for dark roads ahead. Getting too fond of the characters isn't advised. Some of them aren't in for a long stay. Some of them will change. Expect several heel turns.<br /><br />There are powerful moments. The first episode alone (\\"Days Gone Bye\\") offers three searing images. We see Morgan Jones (Lennie James, from JERICHO) sighting thru his rifle telescope as he searches for his undead wife. Later, we gaze at a horrifying aerial view of zombies swamping a tank inhabited by a cowering Rick. But maybe the most memorable scene has everything to do with Rick's returning to the park and to that crawling torn-in-half zombie woman. That moment, strangely enough, maybe encapsulates what this show is about. Despair and empathy.<br /><br />It's zombie melodrama; it's character driven. I hope the slow burn approach doesn't throw you off. I do think that some of the characters are plucked from clich&eacute; city, and the featured love triangle is all kinds of old, and that the last four episodes aren't as gripping as the first two. But never mind. As embodied by English actor Andrew Lincoln, Rick Grimes, in his stoic, quiet way, is a compelling character. Born in London, Lincoln emulates that southern drawl quite nicely. (Maybe I'll refrain from mentioning that Andrew Lincoln's real last name is Clutterbuck.) My second favorite character, by the way, is Glenn who is just a likable dude. There aren't a lot of chuckles in this series, but Glenn provides moments of levity.<br /><br />Visceral and graphic, zombies don't quite usher in the sexy the way vampires do; zombies instead bring the icky and the missing bits. But AMC and all involved have put in the work and what they've done is add prestige to this often dismissed genre, sort of what TRUE BLOOD has done for vampires and DEXTER, for serial killers. THE WALKING DEAD is a contemplative - and, sometimes, ponderous - doomsday saga. It is despairing and devastating and, if you keep watching and if it lasts long enough, will shatter your heart a bunch of times. The Walking Dead, if you haven't gotten it yet, doesn't only refer to the zombies.<br /><br />Lastly, I like this show very much, but damn if I'll spend the asking price ($25.99) for a DVD with only six episodes in it.missed genre, sort of what TRUE BLOOD has done for vampires and DEXTER, for serial killers.

030014332X|5.0|I purchased this book because I was looking for an interesting juvenile world history.  I wasn't disappointed.    According to the preface, A Little History of the World began in 1935, when Gombrich was a newly graduated but unemployed art historian.  A publishing acquaintance asked him to read an English history book for children in preparation for translation and inclusion in a German nonfiction series for children.  Gombrich was so disappointed with the quality of the work that he told the publisher it was not worth translating, and concluded his remarks by saying that he could probably write a better history himself.  The publisher invited him to submit a chapter, so Gombrich wrote a lively account of the age of chivalry.  The publisher was so delighted with the result that he asked Gombrich to write an entire history book for the series---and gave him exactly six weeks to do so, the time originally alotted for the translation of the English book.    Gombrich chose the historical episodes he included by asking himself which events were best remembered and had touched the most lives.  He read selections from his writing to the young woman he was courting, who later became his wife.  The book was published in 1936, then rapidly translated to five other languages, but by then, Gombrich and his wife had moved from Germany to England.     More than thirty years later, a German publisher asked Gombrich to produce a second edition, and he complied.  Then in the 1990s, he decided to write an updated edition of the book, and this time, he decided to translate it to English.  Gombrich unfortunately died before the book was completely revised, but this is a good, lively volume of juvenile world history, perfect for reading aloud.
1400079144|1.0|I expected more from this author, after having seen the movies of his earlier books. Did not expect much really - but this turned out to be a cheap serial killer type book. I could only draw a parallel with Silence of the Lambs. Gory, bloody content with a sadistic serial killer sporting scary tattoos + poorly explained Eastern philosphical ideas + boring.     This book sucked. This is my first and will be the last time I read this author.
0810979772|4.0|I'd say about 1/3 or the book is normal Wimpy Kid stuff, but then there are plenty of space for your kids to do their own thing.  Then about the last 1/3 of the book is just blank lined pages, so your kid can write his/her own story.  4 stars b/c so much of the book is blank.
B004APVI1G|5.0|The movie is visually stunning. The 3D Imax version left such an impression on my 10 yr. son that he is now \\"plowing\\" through the 15 books in this series. I couldn't be happier! Both my boys 8 and 10 felt that seeing this movie and its classic story was a special memory. I know they'll look back and remember this - like I did when I saw Star Wars! Enjoy!
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I love these shoes. They're super comfortable and they won't make your feet smell( unlike other canvas flats). At first, when you take them out of the box, they don't fit very well, so give them time. After about 3 hours, the shoe will become less snug and form to your foot. These are the only shoes I wear on a daily basis. They've never given me blisters and they're easy to clean. Buy them!
B002ZG98Q4|5.0|I grew up with The little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin and this is one of the best Disney movies in my opinion. it is right up there with all their other classics! My whole family adored it. It leaves you with this happy magical feeling only Disney can provide. The story was flawless and original. The music was great and Alan Menken's musical score was breathtaking! The voice work was awesome and the characters were well developed! I cannot wait for this to be released on Blu-Ray!    I hope it wins the Oscar for Best Animated picture! As it truly deserves it!
B0045LSIRM|4.0|Gonna keep it short....been an Adams fan for decades. Though some say that this album is just MTV UNPLUGGED part 2, they're very wrong. Bare Bones is more personal. The Unplugged album in 97 was more established and polished. Bare Bones is like getting only BA. But there's a few ups and downs:    THE GOOD PARTS:  - Adams sounds amazing   - So great to hear the classics acoustically  - Adams' charm can be heard (listen to the amazingly funny PLEASE FORGIVE ME)  - He interacts greatly with the audience    THE BAD PARTS:  - He often cuts the songs short, be it missing a 2nd verse or skipping the middle eight/bridge! Listen to LET'S MAKE A NIGHT, ALL FOR LOVE, for example.  - Some songs seems the same as the UNPLUGGED album like THE ONLY THING and I'M READY  - He should have put more lesser famous songs instead of a greatest hits feeling here    All in all, it's a great album I wish there was a part 2....
B002ZG99A4|1.0|A truly low point for Stallone and the rest of the cast. An absolute waste of time and money.  You'd get more satisfaction watching paint dry. Skip it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|was hooked from the git go like all of nicks 16 books so far. one of his best, i say that almost every year. the notebook, a walk to remember, the wedding, true believer, three weeks w my brother, theyre all so spectacular- i tell all my friends about them. nick is the king- even if there were parallels to sleeping- i didnt even consciously connect the two until reading the critiques. there is no critique from me- except jo was a bit out there but the thrill of the chase more than made up for that. i wanted kevin to meet cujo or some gruesome torture- ok close enough
0307454541|5.0|Once you get started with this book, you won't be able to put it down. I found it a little bloated but always interesting. I'm nearly through with the second book in the series, The Girl Who Played With Fire, and my comments for it would be the same--somewhat repetitious but eminently readable. The author is really good at creating interesting characters, and his action scenes are fantastic.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, but hope to soon.  This soundtrack is awesome!!  Cher is Wonderful in 'You haven't seen the last of me' and Christina belts out Etta James' 'Somethings Got a Hold on Me', so Fabulous!!  You will be singing these songs in your head and want to listen to this soundtrack over and over.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|Bought one of these for my living room computer which was to have no desk, the screen swings out in front of my recliner. When i replaced that computer with an all in 1 touchscreen it worked beautifully for that as well and ordered another to setup the first at my desk. Bought the third for my guest computer because the tiny (old mini roll top)desk couldn't fit a keyboard mouse and screen.     They mount in any direction (with a bolt-through or a clamp) and the joints can be tightened in place so it can hold your screen where ever you want, of left loose enough to let you swing the screen out of the way.    The only part i was displeased with was the cable-holders, they don't hold cables. They're supposed to snap together in the arm, but the snap is so week that if you ever move the arm they come apart; I simply used zip-ties through the holes for the original holders.
055338466X|2.0|As learned theologians may prove poor connoisseurs of science and its methods, and correspondingly unable to articulate what science is to the general public, so conversely being a top-notch scientist does not mean one has more than average abilities to address the existential questions of theology.<br /><br />Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow conclude that science now serves man in the role formerly played by philosophy and religion. They do this without acknowledging they now espouse a new philosophy and a new religion of sorts. Save that it's not really new. For as G.K. Chesterton pointed out, a materialist is a materialist is a materialist whether they live in the twelfth century or the twenty-first century. And so for a theist. The difference between now and then is today we have more data and more complicated theories with which to deal.<br /><br />Deny it though they might - surely they would - Hawking and Mlodinow are really neo-pantheists. They worship in the church of scientific materialism and on their altar is gravity. For the punch-line of The Grand Design is that the law of gravity makes an otherwise improbable universe inevitable. Gravity is a priori. But while they point out that the religionist is fairly asked whence the God they worship comes from, the scientists never feel the need to ask themselves Who authored the law of gravity.<br /><br />The book itself is okay. It is reasonably well-written, concise, and beautifully illustrated. However, there is much in the substance of the science and theory that is unsatisfactory. In fairness, the only way it could be made complete in this respect while maintaining its readability were if the reader to go earn a doctorate in theoretical physics and then come back for a fuller treatment of the technical details of quantum mechanics and m-theory. But then, that would be a different, and much longer book.<br /><br />Read The Grand Design for a glancing view of the picture of creation which physics and cosmology have revealed to those smart enough to design the experiments, manipulate the math, and imagine the theories. But don't get your theology from the authors. Better to read the Sermon on the Mount, G.K. Chesterton, C.S. Lewis, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Mother Theresa, Elder Porphyrios and so on, for one's spiritual education. For while Hawking and Mlodinow may be brilliant scientists, they are mediocre atheists who believe they've evolved beyond God. In doing so, they've become mere pagans fetishizing not mountain spirits and wood demons, but rather gravity, m-theory, and all the universes they see in their equations.mology have revealed to those smart enough to design the experiments, manipulate the math, and imagine the theories.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I loved this movie, it takes you through a life span and makes you realize how precious and short our time is.  I'm going to demand that people wear red at my funeral.  If you liked this beautiful Tim Burton work, check out the book \\"Fup\\" by Jim Dodge, a quick read in sort of the same mind set
B000N6U0E2|4.0|This movie belongs in every movie lover's library. Based on a true story, Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman. While Gardner is desperately trying to sell high-end medical equipment, his wife abandons him and their son. Gardner knows he cannot support his son for long by continuing in his profession, so he displays that plucky American entrepreneurial spirit and enters a cutthroat competition to become a high paid executive at a financial institution. The competition is basically a full-time, six-month internship with no pay, during which time Gardner must outperform the other competitors.      Meanwhile, Gardner must raise his son alone and still sell medical equipment to support them. Will Smith does a great job portraying Gardner juggling all of these competing responsibilities, some while homeless.   Ultimately, the movie celebrates hard work and American entrepreneurship.
B001FOPODS|5.0|I used this movie to present the different types of instruments to my Brownie Troop for their Sounds of Music Try-It Badge.  Most of them liked it.  A couple were bored, but I think it has to do with the age range. It is a lovely production.  There is no narration, however, for those who are used to seeing this in a live concert.
B002VECM6S|5.0|A touching drama based on the true story of Baltimore Ravens' offensive tackle Michael Oher. Growing up, Oher was an athletically-gifted, homeless African-American. Accepted into a private school on a financial scholarship, a rich, Christian family, the Tuohys, befriends Oher and eventually adopts him, giving him the love and stability he needs to become an all-American football player.      The movie is a glowing account of what Christian faith, when practiced, really looks like. In a remarkably refreshing portrayal, Christian love is, again and again, a motivating factor for several characters in the movie to do what's right. Sandra Bullock, in an Oscar-winning role as Leigh Ann Tuohy, remarked after finishing the film, \\"Wow, I finally met someone who practices but doesn't preach.\\"     In one scene of the movie, a government official attempts to confuse Michael by accusing the Tuohys of adopting him only to help their alma mater, Ole Miss, recruit a star player. Michael realizes this is false, however, by recognizing he wants to go to Ole Miss because that's where his \\"family\\" went. The government agent is seen as meddling in the family's affairs, far out of bounds from where the government has any business intruding. My wife loves this movie.    The cast is what makes this from being just a glorified Hallmark-moment movie.  Besides Sandra Bullock's fine performance (the best of her career), Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates also turn in underrated turns.
B000002KDM|5.0|i have loved JT ever since 'fire and rain' hit the airwaves , long ago and far far away. the sweet baby james lp (shows my age, to say 'lp') is ingrained on my soul just like abbey road or the first csn album is. back then, i didnt always have money to buy albums, but i had a bad habit of borrowing them from friends then keeping them for ages. and so, i got to hear mud slide slim that way! it reminds me of warm summer days, young love, dreams of being a great songwriter myself someday. He influenced my playing and writing, as he did thousands of others. i've recently dug out my vinyl copy, and rediscovered the gems within. Funny, albums were their own seperate worlds...i never thought, back then, about the similarities between this, sweet baby james, and one man dog. but they sound the same, they make a fine trilogy of sound. then with 'walking man' he broke new ground and found his commercial sound that served him well. but its these early records (there i go again!) that do it for me. so, the cd of mud slide is on my xmas list this year, along with Joni Mitchell's 'Hejira', which everyone should own too! i highly reccomend mud slide...gentle, sweet, funky, and classic.

B001UV4XHY|2.0|I really loved all the Harry Potter's except this one and the first one.  The first one was too childish for my taste.  And this one was too boring.  Over half of the movie they are stranded on the side of a mountain or a hill waiting for Harry to figure out how to destroy a Horcrux. There were times when I wondered if J. K. Rowling has seen broke back mountain a few too many times.  If Ron and Harry had been left on the side of the mountain who knows this might have come true.   The movie was good up until the last hour where all you see is them trapped on the side of the hill.  This may have been okay for the readers of the book but not for someone who is only into the movies.   In the end I think that Warner Brothers is just attempting to milk this story for all its worth with its 2 parts.  It would have probably been okay if it was all there, but then again what do you expect from a greedy company like Warner Brothers.
B004BSIJ9Q|2.0|I've given this album about 4 full listenings and I just can't get into it no matter how much I want to.  It just doesn't grab me for some reason.
B004BSIJ9Q|3.0|While this album is a big improvement over 808's, it's really not a true return to form. There's a handful a good Kanye songs here, but otherwise it's really meandering and just seems to go nowhere. Songs like \\"Blame Game\\" start off OK but just seem to go nowhere. The \\"weezy taught me\\" part of that song is, by far, one of the lowest points of the album. I just don't get it. Is it supposed to be funny or something? I really can't tell. The rhymes also just aren't as tight as they've been. Certain songs, like Goreous and Power, sound like the old introspective Kanye is coming back, but knowing what we know now it just seems insincere. Strange. Had Kanye not spend the last 5 years ruining his reputation, this album be perceived as better than it is. Unfortunately, people who aren't already convinced won't be able to separate the product from the producer.
B000002H2Z|5.0|That's exactly what The Cure's Head on the Door is. After the less than stellar reception of The Top from 1984, The Cure changed their lineup, with Simon Gallup rejoining The Cure, and Boris Williams taking over on drums.  This shift in The Cure's lineup is just one factor that makes The Head on the Door one the Cure's best albums. Another factor is the music. Whereas The Top felt more like a Robert Smith solo record, The Head on the Door is the sound of The Cure as group again. Classic tracks such as \\"Inbetween Days\\", \\"Close to Me\\", \\"A Night Like This\\", and \\"Kyoto Song\\" makes The Head on the Door a must-own for any Cure fan.
1439133948|4.0|Miles Vorkosigan is back, and that's always a good thing.  Here the interest is divided between Miles and a YA hero, which is not such a good thing--a responsible Miles is perhaps less interesting than Miles the dispossessed young terror, but the kid doesn't take his place.      However, CRYOBURN develops into an exciting read, with a fascinating premise and a touching ending that leaves the future of the series wide open.  What will Bujold do with Miles next?    Get the hardcover with the included CD, which has ALL the previous Miles Vorkosigan novels in e-readable format and lots of extra goodies.
B000002LK1|5.0|Violator is to Depeche Mode what Disintegration is to The Cure. An album that defines DM not just for that timeframe,but overall. Depeche Mode had already achieved success with 1987's Music for the Masses, but Violator took DM to a whole new level. Featuring megahits \\"Personal Jesus\\", Enjoy the Silence\\", & \\"Policy of Truth\\", as well as album tracks such as \\"Blue Dress\\", and \\"Clean\\", Violator is flawless from start to end. The Definite album of the 90s.
031603438X|5.0|I've been anticipating this book since it was first announced, and I'm happy to say it's better than I had hoped.  Read the Product Descriptions and other reader reviews if you need a book report, but if you're a Stones fan, a guitarist in a band, or you lived through their heyday, you will definitely enjoy this.  Keith comes off as a very decent chap despite the drugs and the craziness.  And he's a class act.  He keeps the Mick bashing under control, though I suspect he could have done a lot more.  I hope Mick writes his own book someday to get his side of these stories.  My only warning: Don't put the book on your top shelf.  (When you read it, you'll understand. ;-))
1401207529|5.0|After Crisis on Infinite Earths. DC felt it was time to revamp their characters' origins, without the convoluted continuity issues from past comics. And they figured the best place to start would be with DC's Big Three: Superman, Batman, & Wonder Woman. While Superman and Wonder Woman's origins were completely revamped, Batman's origin remained relatively unchanged, but added in extra elements to give it more depth. So now the question next was who was going to work on it. Enter: Frank Miller and David Mazzuchelli. Considered one of the greatest writers in the comic industry, Frank Miller was no stranger to Batman, having worked on 1986's The Dark Knight Returns. And David Mazzuchelli, while still somewhat new in the comic book industry, had some great works under his belt. Both Miller and Mazzuchelli were no strangers to each other, both having worked together on Daredevil's Born Again Storyline. So both volunteered to work on Batman's origin story. Tne end result would be Batman Year One<br /><br />A 4 part storyline that ran through Batman #404-407, Batman Year One chronicles The Dark Knight's first year of crimefighting. From Bruce Wayne's determination to fight crime, to James Gordon dealing with corruption in Gotham Police Department, and also including Bruce Wayne's first encounter with Selina Kyle (Catwoman), Batman Year One is everything a graphic novel should be. Great writing, detailed artwork, perfect characterization. Batman Year One is the benchmark that all Batman stories have to measure up to. And it also served a major influence on Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|This movie has lots of killing, stuff blowing up, and violence. Exactly what is needed after a bad day or after watching the news cover what our knucklehead politicians are doing to this country. My wife and I were thoroughly entertained through the entire movie. Stallone still knows how to make them!
0470450266|5.0|Even though I use 3D Coat and Mudbox, I bought this book for anatomy reference material...and it was well worth it. Great extras covering the painting of skin textures, creating the costume and all it's implements, etc. Definitely would recommend this book for anyone modeling characters in 3D...no matter what application is used.
0749916206|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Many Lives, Many Masters and thoroughly enjoyed this book as well. Regardless of whether or not you believe in reincarnation, this is a fascinating love story.
B00005ASOI|3.0|I hardly consider this a master piece. The story was not well rounded and seemed to go in circles a lot till they come down to this conclusion that it was a witch doing the whole thing. Why not a serial killer or some other psychopath? Logically that's what any detective would realize but no they figure out its a witch. I give the director props for his settings, they are good and well made. Plus the coloration was well thought out however I couldn't give much to the music. At first scary and eerie it became more and more obnoxious as the movie went on. Still the movie did have its moments and I would say that it was decent but by no means would I say it was a masterpiece.

B001DDBCUA|1.0|Wow, its kind of suprising that an entire series, movie, and practially an entire movement can be based on such dry comedy and boring interactions.  It speaks a lot about American pop culture that such a boring series is such a big deal.    I know a lot of people will be angry at this comment, but it is truth so I will say it:    I must admit, it is nice to see that beautiful women aren't the only ones that can make it on the big screen.  But the question has often been asked, why is it that men do not like the Sex in the City movies?  Well, perhaps you could start with the women who star in the movies.  There is nothing attractive about them.  On a scale of 1-10, most of them hover in the 2-3 range.  They can be described as homely, or \\"plain Janes,\\" despite their wardrobe of name brands and professional make up artists.  I was the guest at someone's house and had to politely watch this movie. And from a guy's perspective, it was incredibly boring, and in a way, comedic.  I found it amusing how homely women are apparently thought to be so attractive and drop dead gorgeous.  They are also perceived as cultural icons, even though they are not particularly intelligent and the jokes are so shallow.  Oh well, to each its own.  Whenever I see Sex on the City, I'll change the channel to something infinitely more exciting, which pretty much describes everything.
1594744475|5.0|I absolutely love this book!  My children are a little older, 14 and 11,but they hate cafeteria lunches.  Personally, I hate paying for them when they don't get eaten.  This book has given me ideas, great ideas, that I have taken and used to create fun lunches for both of them.  The best part is that the kids get in to it with me.  We make their lunches together.  Anyone who has teens knows how rare it is for them to want to do something with their parents.  My daughter (14) thinks this is the greatest thing ever, and my son (11) has come up with some fantastic ideas of his own.  My hat is off to the authors!  Thanks for helping us come together over making a nutritious lunch!
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|I thought this movie sucked and is a disgrace compared to the excellance of the series.  The show is a classic.  So well written with a consistancy in quality including spontaneous inspired performances to match the well written stories that made you fall in love with the characters.  This movie was over the top which the series could be but was over the top to the extent of bad judgement.  Most of the ideas were uninspired and trying to be funny and or compellingly dramatic but were dead on arrival.  i just don't think they can handle a movie script as they were able to produce 30 minutes of magic.  Maybe next time.

B001G9LVGG|5.0|I love this album, it goes perfect with my other albums which have a more medieval and renaissance flavor.  Her voice is great and the arrangements are superb.  Very haunting, ethereal and beautiful!!
0375703764|5.0|As soon as I heard about this novel I wanted it. It breaks the third wall that exists between an art medium and the viewer in a way I though was impossible for a book to do. I am very satisfied that my wife bought it for me after years of longing tinged with shame for a full reading list of half finished books. This is now at the top and being devoured.
B002C949KE|5.0|I've always enjoyed the social side of microeconomics (rather than its drier quantitative/statistical components) and the broad path one can take to exploring consumer behavior and decision-making. This book should be required reading for all undergraduates in psychology as well as economics. If you enjoyed [[ASIN:0060889578 SuperFreakonomics: Global Cooling, Patriotic Prostitutes, and Why Suicide Bombers Should Buy Life Insurance]] you will definitely be delighted with Predictably Irrational.

0553805371|5.0|He really draws you in, and then explains things in layman's terms anyone can understand.  Great book for the regular reader interested in theoretical physics.  The sense of humor that is put into this book is great, so it not only makes you think about the universe(s) around you, but also can give you a good chuckle every couple pages, wonderful book!
B003YFIUW8|2.0|***Spoiler Alert***  On a high level, the story of a mother's love overcoming an intolerable existence was powerful.  However, the story had some deficiencies that became impossible to overcome.  First, the story was told through the voice of Jack, a 5 year old.  This was interesting, for a short time, but quickly became distracting and then flat out ANNOYING!  Worse were the inconsistencies in his narration.  His mother manages to teach him all sorts of things but not how to use the word \\"the.\\"  They live in \\"room\\", they walk on \\"rug\\", and they sleep on \\"bed.\\"  It became a distraction and didn't fit with an otherwise remarkably intelligent boy.   Despite this, the first half of the book held my interest but, interestingly, fell apart after their escape.  I was even willing to overlook the implausible details of the escape and considered it a means to an end.  They had to escape to show how living in the \\"real world\\" would affect Jack and \\"ma.\\"  But things got progressively confusing and incongruous.  \\"Ma\\" spends 5 years nurturing her son in the most inhospitable environment.  Then within days of their escape tries to kill herself.  Really?  While ma is recuperating, Jack's uncle and aunt help take care of him...and the first place they take him is to the mall!  REALLY?  Then grandma takes him to the store...and she lets him out of her sight long enough for him to take the escalator downstairs.  REALLY??? The woman who's daughter was kidnapped and missing for seven years would lose a 5 year old on her first trip to the store with him.  It just doesn't make sense.  And then there are numerous examples of interactions that are equally improbable: the impatience grandma has with Jack. HE LIVED IN A SHED FOR 5 YEARS AND ONLY INTERACTED WITH HIS MOTHER.  Doesn't that earn him a little slack?  Should grandma really get angry with him for getting lost in the store?  Should auntie be a little more understanding when Jack wants to but everything in the store?  And most of all, shouldn't ma understand Jack's attachment to \\"Room\\" and desire to go back?       \\"Room\\" was a thought provoking story that did not live up to it's potential.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|Zagg.... (thumbs down!)  Thank god I didn't pay retail $32 for this because it is the absolute worst! Its so thick that it's like pushing on cushion when I touch my iPhone 4 screen. Not smooth. Ruins retina display. Doesn't cover all of the glass parts. Horrible cutting. So thick that it is not compatible with all of my covers but one. Bubbles when using certain ones- including apple's bumper. I am so disappointed with Zagg. Application wasn't hard but does require time and patience. And if it actually was a perfect or good screen protector I wouldn't mind but it is the WORST! even 0.99 cent ones on eBay are 100x's better!! Don't waste your time or money! Go with power support (apple store's) screen protector.

B002G1YPH0|3.0|This is a great fan and all but before you purchase it make sure it is compatible with your motherboard. I don't just mean if it works but make sure it doesn't cover any thing up, when I installed it it covered the memory slots so I couldn't put my memory in and since I opened it I can't return it.
B0049D1TCM|5.0|this album is the ish every song on here is straigh fire i see the kim stans came on here to ruin her ratings but im here to give you the truth his album if fire although just between me and you i do wish there were more songs like romans revenge, not about dissing somebodies grandma but you know not mainstream although i understand those type of songs dont sell to mainstream, anyway her album is still hot and worth the money.....IT'S PINK FRIDAY SNITCHES!!!!!      Edit: dec 5th-my b-day  i change my mind my fav song is \\"did it on em\\" and \\"muny\\" and now that i think about it im glad she didnt have more hardcore songs i like the album the way it is. the only songs i didnt like was the ones with kanye, drake, and natasha bedingfield. she could have done this whole album herself she didnt need all the extra's but you can still listen to the whole album without skipping a song. anybody who gave this album 1 star i dont think that they listened to the album or they just listened to the snippets and then tried to be funny by giving it one star

B003ZDZ22U|5.0|This is a fantastic CD release of songs from the TV Series \\"Hannah Montana Forever\\" by Hannah Montans (Miley Cyrus). The CD opens with the track, \\"Gonna Get This\\", a good electro-pop/rap song featuring Iyaz. \\"Que Sera\\" is a great pop track : great vocals & melody. \\"Odinary Girl\\" is a solid pop track/gem : beautiful guitar & clear great vocals. \\"Kiss It Goodbye\\" is a good but 'noisy' electro-dance track. \\"I'll Always Remember You\\" is a solid pop track/gem. \\"Need A Little Love\\" is another solid track/gem : a beautiful pop/countrish song featuring Sheryl Crow. \\"Are You Ready?\\" is an okay 'noisy' electro-pop song. \\"Love That Let's Go\\" is a solid pop track/gem : a beautiful melodical track with great vocals & harmonies (featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, Miley's dad). This is my favourite track from this great & fantastic CD and hence the title of my review. \\"I'm Still Good\\" is a great pop/rock track. The closing track, \\"Barefoot Cinderella\\" is a great pop track. On overall, this is a fantastic CD release from the popular TV Series, \\"Hannah Montana Forever\\", a highly recommended listening for both young & adult fans.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I love this series!!! It's great and as far as it being accurate and true to history it does an ok job, but overall it is entertaining which is what is important. I also found out that if you order it from the Tudors website it costs about 40 dollars more than amazon and you get free shipping from amazon too. I'm pretty sure my husband is going to get me this for Christmas!!! YAY!!!

0061997811|5.0|This is a fantastic book for fans of the films and books. There are items such as: Harry's first letter from Hogwarts, Wizard Wheezes Catalog, Yule Ball Ticket, Quidditch World Cup Program, Potion's Book, Marauder's Map, and many more. It has wonderful background information from the film makers with details from the costume designers and set designers. There are tidbits about how J.K. Rowling helped to keep the film on track. It also has information from the actors and actresses from the films and the experience over the past 10 years making the films. Having read the books many times and seen the movies, I have already found many interesting facts that I hadn't known. I just got it yesterday and I'm sure I will continue to be impressed and amazed. Enjoy!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|\\"Burlesque\\" is a touching motion picture with endearing performances and choreography of a kaleidoscope of musical numbers uniquely original...inspired pairing of legend Cher with Christina who has a voice of brilliance rare today in the world of music is beautifully showcased in this stunning vehicle. In the story line these amazing talented ladies work well together and are believable...production numbers are stunning & engrossing throughout and incredible to watch and at the core of each are great songs. Ultimately what makes this captivating Original Motion Picture Soundtrack really work are two superb vocal talents who are both great to watch and sublime to listen to...musicians are inspired and every great song arranged to perfection so hopefully \\"Oscar\\" will give a nod to this wonderful musical achievement!  Starting strong with Etta James classic \\"Something's Got A Hold On Me\\", clearly Christina is equipped to handle this soulful anthem in her own stirring way...old & new songs flow well together with some used to further story line but all work well as pleasurable to listen to and even an old Mae West classic \\"A Guy Who Takes His Time\\" is given a classy showcase and comes off fiery & exciting as a tremendous production number plus equally fun to listen to.  Cher's powerful soulful anthem \\"You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me\\" finds her at her mesmerizing magnificent best emoting with an moving vulnerable edge to her tour-de-force performance...new self-penned gorgeous power-ballad \\"Bound To Me\\" is the riveting Christina soulful & breathtaking anthem...superb Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is filled with delicious musical treats and sure to spin on all lovers of those great singers disc-changers for years to come...Bravo Cher & Christina!
B002ZG981E|5.0|Saw it in theaters. Thought it was pretty decent and didn't regret going to see it in theaters instead of watching it on netflix, but I don't plan on buying it or watching it again. The ending is very opened ended.  Everyone has there speculations on what possibly happened.

B000001A3H|2.0|Kyuss isn't really a bad band by any means, but they seriously needed a quality songwriter in the band.  Stoner rock at its most generic, I'd say.    \\"Thumb\\" contains riffs reminiscent of old Zeppelin and Sabbath songs, but without the riffs actually being memorable.  That's the biggest problem with the album right here- it tries to create decent guitar riffs, but somehow always finds a way to fail.  \\"Green Machine\\" sounds like a Megadeth throwaway track.  \\"Molten Universe\\" takes a riff section from Sabbath's \\"Snowblind\\" and makes it the main dominating riff.  \\"50 Million Year Trip (Downside Up)\\" has a nice speedy guitar riff before quickly dissolving into generic forgettable riffage. \\"Thong Song\\" features a lead singer growling carelessly with his out of tune hoarse voice and spitting out a terrible vocal melody.    \\"Apothecaries' Weight\\" has some nice drumming and a steady rhythm before VERY average alternative rock riffage comes into play, \\"Caterpillar March\\" contains some of the most predictable and brain dead drumming and guitar playing I've ever heard, and it's impossible to believe anybody would truly like it.  \\"Freedom Run\\" is just outright bizarre so it's probably the best song here.    \\"800\\" has some nice drumming and weird chanting vocals- an obvious highlight. \\"Writhe\\" has bad, intentionally lazy and forgettable vocals. \\"Capsized\\" has guitar playing probably ripped from an old Zeppelin or Eric Clapton tune but at least it's decent.  Of course Zeppelin or Clapton would have actually taken the guitar playing somewhere *interesting* instead of repeating the same set of simple notes so often, but at least it's not a bad song.  \\"Allen's Wrench\\" sounds like a poor Metallica imitation without the songwriting to back it up... or rather, 90's Metallica.  \\"Mondo Generator\\" is basically another awful Sabbath imitation but with REALLY bad vocals implemented this time.  So terrible.  \\"Yeah\\" finally closes this unappealing collection of disappointments by being... yeah.      Overall, not a very good album.
B000G6BM00|2.0|James Cameron must be a magician! Somehow, some way, he's got the masses buying into that he creates masterpieces. Well, he has created ONE certified classic, the original TERMINATOR, but that was more luck and good timing than anything; not to mention, the fact that he wasn't given much to work with at the time probably drove him to put more thought into the more important aspects of filmmaking...you know, writing, directing, and character! ALIENS (1986) frankly doesn't have any of that working in it's favor. An early example of a \\"bigger\\", \\"badder\\", \\"bolder\\" sequel that's full of holes and contradicts it's classic predecessor ALIEN (not directed by Cameron...big surprise!).     I think I know the worst offense of these big sequels...very little makes sense! So the corporate bigwigs responsible for the colonization of the alien planet had NO idea of the threat? Yes, Ripley was floating in stasis for 57 years, but it didn't occur to them that the reason for the long-missing spaceship and crew from ALIEN had something to do with their experience on that planet? Why was it necessary for RIPLEY to go on the mission with the macho space Marines? Even though she had firsthand experience with the ONE alien in the original, she was hardly a scientist; what could she contribute other than just to inform them that the alien(s) can implant seeds into human hosts? Which she actually did, but they wouldn't listen?! I say, let them fend for themselves! And that little alien in the first one was a beast! That thing mopped up the floor with virtually all those humans on board the ship. But in ALIENS, you've literally got hordes of bigger and badder aliens that had a heck of a time taking out pretty much the SAME amount of humans as in the first one! I know these Marines were well armed, but there looked to be THOUSANDS of these creatures on the planet.     So Ripley and Co. just basically stay hidden long enough for Cameron to incorporate empty dialogue scenes to delineate one-dimensional, stereotypical characters (Marines consist of the weak-willed officer \\"in charge\\", the grumpy cigar-smoking \\"Sarge\\", the comic relief wiseass, the hardcore street-smart \\"Hispanic\\", etc.). And Ripley herself (played one-note the whole way through by Sigourney Weaver) is actually, for my money, the most annoying character of the flick! No offense, but after 57 years in stasis and surviving the painful ordeal of ALIEN, she shouldn't be this tough-as-nails character that is oblivious to a bunch of creatures 10 times the size of the first one coming at her in droves! Adrenaline be damned! And then there's that painfully pretentious child Newt, who really serves no purpose other than to play on the audience sympathy.    I will say that a few actors manage to create semblance of character and rise above the material (Michael Biehn as Private Hicks, Paul Reiser as company man Burke, and Lance Henriksen as android Bishop). Had the rest of the characters been better written and portrayed as these, I could have gotten into the story more. But the rest of the cast is just plain annoying!     ALIENS is another example of a Hollywood film where the focus was too much on quick, cheap thrills trying to outdo it's predecessor, rather than on creating anything truly interesting or long-lasting. I mean, after you watch this movie once, there is really no need to see it again. No worries, Cameron got enough people to pay to see it in theaters the first time!
B0042RUMIW|5.0|Fantastic CD/ DVD.  My husband and I went to see the concert in our city, and it was by far a wonderful experience.  this was a great way to remember our experience at his concert.  Keep in mind, I am a huge Sting fan, but the CD did not disappoint.
B000000OA6|5.0|I heartily disagree that this is Queens best cd, however it's still a great one from this band.  Alot better than any other 80's release except 'the game' which I enjoy more than this one.  I think the bands 80's content is generally more mellow than what came before; but this one just smokes.  It's queen at their best but NOT their best release imo.  I can't say there's a bad song on here and a few are as good as their seventies music completely. That being said I don't think queen ever had a bad cd in the least , not even 'made in heaven' which is a very mellow cd and was put out after Freddies death. Fans should be aware of the fact that if you love the seventies queen this has moments that good and lots of great rock songs but it isn't ' a day at the races' , or 'news of the world' , but it's close in some respects and is closer to 'notw' than the other one which is fine. I would say that if you were put off by 'a kind of magic' which is a good cd , or 'hot space' which is also good , this one should make you happy.
B000QCS9NM|3.0|I feel the need to add in the same warning I saw on another review - THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR CHILDREN!  IT'S ALSO NOT FOR SOMEONE WITH A WEAK STOMACH OR SOMEONE WHO GETS OFFENDED EASILY!    I recently finished reading the novel Choke by author Chuck Palahniuk.  If you're not familiar with his name, you're definitely familiar with some of his work - this is the man who wrote Fight Club and countless other novels.  Someone at work recommended him for something to read that was interesting and \\"out there\\" so I decided to download some of his stuff to my Kindle and give it a shot.    Choke is definitely an interesting concept.  The main character, a drop-out medical student named Victor Mancini, is a sex addict working as an Irish indentured servant in a colonial reenactment town.  His mother, Ida, is in a nursing facility; she is addled with dementia after years and years of drug abuse.  His upbringing was definitely NOT your traditional childhood, and, as a result, his view on society is very skewed.    How skewed?  He goes to expensive restaurants and makes himself choke on his food.  Why?  So some unknowing stranger will be forced to perform the Heimlich maneuver to save him.  His idea is, after saving his life, the stranger feels protective of him and wants to make sure he's okay for the rest of his life.    Like I said, the concept of the book itself is very interesting but very weird.  You are invited into Victor's world through the glimpses he gives of his normal activities.  With his days spent supposedly giving historically-accurate reenactments to school children and tourists; and visiting his mother at St. Anthony's, where he meets an intriguing young woman named Paige Marshall, you get glimpses of how twisted this man's view of the world is.  His nights are consumed with finding as many sexual conquests as he can - normally at Sex Addicts' meeting.    While the concept was interesting, the writing itself was very confusing and slow in my opinion.  I can normally read a novel in less than an evening, and I kept finding myself unable to keep up with this one.  I kept putting it down for days at a time but always returning to it, determined to get through it.  The dialog in parts was very contrived and did not flow well for me.    Palaniuk does know how to flesh out his characters though.  By the time the book ends, he has given birth to a tragically wounded, confused young man who you come to realize is only looking for a place to belong.  Through the glimpses of Ida given as Victor remembers his childhood, you start to get to know this outrageously vivacious drug addict with very strange views on the world; and she tries to impart these views on her son.  And while seeming just a minor character in the Mancini universe at first, Victor's best friend Denny is a well-matched complement to Victor's refusal to combat his vices and addictions.    All in all, I'd have to give this book a 2.5.  It's not something I'll probably read again, but it was worth a read once.  It seems to have enough of a following that, like Fight Club, the book has been turned into a movie (starring Sam Rockwell as Victor Mancini.)
B003ZK58WM|1.0|The price of the Kindle version of this book is a deal breaker for me.  I checked it out the day it was published, intending to buy it.  Fat Chance!  Seems to me the only way to communicate my opinion to the publisher regarding gouging Kindle readers is to join the boycott.  Keep your damn digital book.  I'll get it from the public library.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Ok I admit, Endgame is a good album, but I think this is better overall.  Chuck is growling like a beast, Bostaph is a freakin legend and the sound has never been better. I was never into Testament, but man - these guys know what they are doing.  Definitely one of my favorite thrash albums.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I purchased this to complete my library of the Harry Potter series to date, and will add the two Deathly Hallows movies when they come out. I love the series, and for those who do, this is a must buy. The book is more detailed and gives you the background, but these movies do a pretty good job of capturing the imagination of the books, at least the essence. Just saw Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows and enjoyed it, but of all the movies so far, it leaves out a lot of detail, which makes reading the book all the more essential. \\"The Half Blood Prince\\" DVD is much closer to capturing the detail of the book, but you still understand it better if you've read the book. I re-watched the entire series of DVDs up to this one in preparation for the first installment of the Deathly Hallows and to bring my wife, who hadn't seen any of the films or read the book,up to date. My 9 year old and 29 year old son's both enjoyed catching up in preparation for final two parts by watching this and the prior 4 DVDs.
0618918248|2.0|I still am floored that this book has received so much attention? You will always find the same thing; they cannot give even 1 argument for atheism - they will setup \\"strawmen\\" such as religion and give you a list of reasons why it is so dumb, but this is not a reason \\"for\\" atheism? (not even a very good reason for agnosticism)<br />--I have asked this question time and time again and I always get the same basic answer \\"Well... I admit I don't have a real reason, but religion is stupid!\\" Wow... At least some will say something to the effect of evil/suffering, but then when it is pointed out \\"doesn't this mean there is also good/joy?\\" Or if you say \\"Why does suffering matter anyway if there is no God?\\" Think about it - without God there is nothing good/evil/wrong/right so that over-turns the purpose of this book; if everyone in the world said the Holocaust was a \\"positive\\" thing, accordingly Dawkins has to admit that it is just as positive and negative, *but ironically very few of us live like this. I will give Dawkins credit that he does have the audacity to admit that there is nothing \\"objectively\\" evil with raping a child though he admits he wouldn't like it, (though that is quite alarming and I don't think I would want him watching my kids!)  lol<br /><br />For obvious reasons, Dawkins has refused to debate a Stephen Meyers or William Lane Craig, b/c when you read something like \\"Signature of the Cell\\" Dawkins rightly so, recognizes that it is in his best interest to avoid an open debate with these type individuals.<br /><br />So long story short - My point is that the areas that really need to be explained by atheists still remain and are not addressed by Dawkins:<br />1) Singularity of the Big Bang - causality - Most atheists avoid trying to argue for an eternal universe thuse we must conclude:<br />a) Whatever begins to exist has a cause.<br />b) The universe began to exist.<br />c) therefore the universe has a cause.<br />2) Fine-tuning/bio-genesis - other than completely leaving the realm of science to speculate about a \\"Multi Universe/Multi World\\" the atheists mostly have avoided this topic as well.<br />3) Bio-Genesis - Where did information itself come from? No atheists has made a valid attempt to show DNA/RNA's origin with the exception of yelling \\"chance!\\" and then avoiding the subject.<br />4) Moral values - Here Dawkins at least admits there is nothing evil with an event such as the holocaust, but he fails to address:<br /><br />a) If God does not exist then objective moral values do not exist.<br />b) Moral values do exist. (raping/murder/genocide are not subjectively wrong, but objectively wrong; love is objectively good, (etc))<br />C) Therefore God exists.<br /><br />I will stop there, but these are just 4 simple points that the atheist (thus far) is not capable of refuting.

No atheists has made a valid attempt to show DNA/RNA's origin with the exception of yelling \\"chance!\\" and then avoiding the subject.   4) Moral values - Here Dawkins at least admits there is nothing evil with an event such as the holocaust, but he fails to address:    a) If God does not exist then objective moral values do not exist.   b) Moral values do exist. (raping/murder/genocide are not subjectively wrong, but objectively wrong; love is objectively good, (etc))   C) Therefore God exists.     I will stop there, but these are just 4 simple points that the atheist (thus far) is not capable of refuting.

B002ZG98LO|3.0|As expected, this movie adds an interesting twist to the series of Predator movies by bringing a bunch of misfits to another planet to be hunted. The beginning is unique and interesting. The humans aren't admirable or likable in many ways, but being the target of others on safari still makes you root for the earthlings. And they all aren't totally unlikable. Just as the other Predator movies have some continuity of the Predators, the aliens are tough, brutal, and deadly. There are a few unexpected twists, but most of the movie is violent, filled with death, wondering who will go next, and watching for that next surprise. It is not deep, but it is entertaining if you like the genre. I give it a 3.5 as it is more than ok but less than a classic or really likable movie.
B0015DROBO|5.0|pros: engaging, well written, fun to read, and above all you are hooked from moment one.<br /><br />cons: a lot of violence, graphic, which for me is ok, but i can see how some people would be upset about it.<br /><br />a must buy for anyone that likes a good mystery novel.<br /><br />JP
B002QW7ALM|4.0|It was Sunday, I was bored, PANDORUM was on. I wish I could say that I went into this film thinking it would be entertaining, enjoyable, and that I was thinking positive thoughts as it started, but I can't...and I wasn't. It looked derivative and corny, judging by the trailers I had seen, and the opening minutes did nothing to convince me otherwise.<br /><br />But, I am surprised to say, that as the movie continued, as the story began to expand and make with the twists and go all out with the hard science fiction, I became very engaged with the mystery of it all. I dare say it's one of the more original sci-fi films to be released of late, but it really does fall into the \\"could have been better\\" category.<br /><br />It's hard to say much about the plot without giving things away. Earth is in a state of emergency. With resources running low and tensions high, a ship called the ELYSIUM is launched toward the nearest inhabitable planet: 125 years away. We're then introduced to the protagonist, Bower, as he wakes up from extended hibernation to find most of the ship is on lockdown and losing power fast. It also seems that most of the crew have disappeared, and there's a little problem of monstrous cannibals running amok throughout ELYSIUM. Bower, with the help of his commanding officer, must restore power to the ship and figure out just what the heck happened to their ship, the mission, and the thousands of people who used to occupy it.<br /><br />Really, the main problem with his movie is the directing. It's not necessarily bad, but it places too much emphasis on action and cheap scares for its own good. It was disappointing to see such a well-conceived screenplay reduced to extended instances of brawling. But, alternatively, the directing also allows the hard sci-fi aspects to come through really well.<br /><br />To that end, you have is a really good concept buried beneath layers of clich&eacute;d horror tropes that have been done before, and better. But I emphasize the concept/story because it really is stellar. Combine that with its brevity and you've got a movie that doesn't really overstay its welcome, and rewards you well for sticking with it until its satisfying ending.s stellar.

0596522347|4.0|I've read a lot of the reviews posted on Amazon and I think they go a little overboard. Too negative.... Too one-sided.<br /><br />This title is a good primer for the beginner who needs to impress his boss or other influential people. Presentations are the present and the future. The master of the slide presentation is the one who convinces the viewer that he/she took the time to put together an impressive presentation. While I care little that the author worked with Al Gore, Nancy Duarte has indeed put together a title for someone who wants to go further than the instructions in Powerpoint or Open Office's Impress...
