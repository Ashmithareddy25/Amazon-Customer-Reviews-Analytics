B00279BRHM|5.0|I think the show is great. It was a bit slow at first, but the actors are growing and becoming a team with each passing episode.
034580404X|5.0|Fifty Shades is awesome, I loved all three books...couldn't put them down. Can't wait until the movie is released. I look forward to her next book.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Ok, I am not one of those Star Wars fan that is going to give this set 1 star because it doesnt contain the original versions. (Sure I wish it did, but oh well). Next, Im not going to give it 1 star because Lucas changed a few more things for this release. I am going to review the movies for what they are.<br /><br />Lets start with the original trilogy. In my opinion, Episode 4 A new hope has the most improvement from the dvd transfer a few years ago. Dont get me wrong, all 3 are improved, but A New Hope shows it a little more. As far as Empire Strikes back, I personally didnt like the use of DNR on it. It is distracting. I would have rather had the film grain look. I know why they did it(Keep everything looking consistant throughout)..But it just doesnt work well. Good thing is that is usually doesnt last to long in the places its applied. Next up is Jedi..Its the worst of the 3 in terms of improvement over its previous dvd. Better yes, but not up to HD standards of today.<br /><br />Now I have to say this. The sound on these is the most amazing thing I have ever heard. Its PERFECT. ITs AMAZING...this release is worth the upgrade to blu just for the sound.. No Joke!<br /><br />As far as Episodes 1-3, Revenge of the Sith looks absolutely incredible. This is what I wish all 6 films looked like. Its stunning...Episode 1 is the least improvement, although the CG Yoda is for sure a plus! As to Episode 2, its not near Episode 3, but it is improved. I did notice some DNR apllied, but its not too bad. Again, the sound on all 3 of these movies is PERFECT. Worth the rebuy just for the sound.<br /><br />As to the package and artwork. I like the case and the cardboard book. Its very sturdy.<br /><br />Now on to the bonus features. I really didnt care for the deleted scenes. I can see why Lucas never released these before. They are not important at all to the movies and the quality stinks.<br /><br />The only really thing worth watching is Disc 3 of the bonus features. It contains all the great documentaries and spoofs. I must watch for sure!<br /><br />So there ya go, this set offers improved video quality over the previous dvd releases and provides one with PERFECT sound.<br /><br />What are you waiting for, if your a Star Wars fan, go buy it, originals or not!!!!!
0385342063|5.0|I was so entertained and could not put the book down.  The idea of footnotes is so ingenious and so humorous.  I love it!
030758836X|4.0|This was a well-written easy book to read for the summer. It was one of those books that kept me wanting to read more so I finished it very quickly.
B004U9J9GS|3.0|My friend recommended this book to myself and my son who trained as a chef and then decided to study further before launching himself into the working world.  The book gave me great laughs and I now understand the life-style that my son wishes to avoid! Very informative, great fun and well written.
0345803485|1.0|I'll keep my review short, since most reviewers have already highlighted the worse parts of the book. It seems like the author just randomly picked words out of a giant thesaurus and placed them awkwardly throughout the story...helpful for my upcoming GRE...but detrimental to her reputation as an \\"erotica\\" novelist. I hate to start a book and not finish it, so I will press on, although i don't forsee myself purchasing the next two novels...it just goes to show you can throw sex in anything and make a million dollars
B008CP93S0|4.0|Great date night flick. My wife and I rented it while having dinner in bed, and we really enjoyed it!  Gave it 4 stars because it got a little slow in a few spots, but overall we really liked it!
6305128952|5.0|Horse Whisperer is filmed in extremely beautiful mountain country, with excellent character portrayals by the cast. The story is believable, and can be followed easily, however the ending leaves the viewer with wonderment as to the final outcome.  It stops short of the books' ending, which is kinda bittersweet.  All in all, however, a first class family movie.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I thought Block Story was really good and close to minecraft but unique in its own way. I suggest buying this if you like minecraft, If you play this you will know its uniqe. When I was searching for minecraft on the app store I saying to myself &quot;well Block story is the only minecraft like game I guess I should get it.&quot; I recommend getting this don't fall for the mooncraft game it was not a minecraft game it was a scam.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|this album is amazing, the lyrics are captivating and the story of how bon iver wrote this album makes it even cooler. the_connection sent it at a speedy rate so i could enjoy it even sooner, would def recommend this album on lyrical content alone. plus it includes the all time favorite song, skinny love.
0061906220|5.0|We bought this book for our grandson's 3rd birthday, along with the cd that has Pete the Cat, I Love my White Shoes story and song on it. Our grandson and his siblings thoroughly enjoyed the book, reading it over again and again, as they listened to the cd that read the story, and played the delightful little song that Pete the cat sings. The idea came from my daughter who was doing her student teaching at a preschool and witnessed how much the kids there loved this book. I am very pleased with my purchase!
B0000DBJA7|5.0|awesome album, got a great deal on it from the_connection. i love shopping there for vinyl. def one of my favorite albums. very catchy songs that i find keep getting stuck in my head :)

1452101248|5.0|This cookbook inspires me daily.  I've tried many of the recipes, and all have been outstanding. Yotam Ottolenghi always has a small twist which turns what appear to be simple dishes into really unique and incredibly tasty ones.  I also follow his column in the Guardian for extra ideas.  I'm not crazy about the way the recipes are ordered (call me conservative), but it doesn't really matter - the index solves that problem.  It's been said that if you have 3-4 new recipes that you use regularly from a cookbook, then it's a success.  This one is a HUGE success under those terms.  Click \\"buy\\"!
B00125JP1C|4.0|This movie is completely ridiculous. I love it, you paul giamatti, Monica bellucci and Clive Owen in a movie with a barely held together story, one liners that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger blush and the most unbelievable fight scenes I may have ever seen. But when you have one of those Saturdays that you want to veg out, this movie is it!
B008QWQ0FI|5.0|By now most have heard \\"Winner\\", but the real gems here are the three fantastic other tracks. The best is A Certain \\"Je Ne Sais Quoi\\", a witty track full of bubbling synth hooks. I Started a Joke is a stately Robin Gibb tribute with one of Neil's best ever vocals and some beautiful mournful horn riffs. The Way Through the Woods is based on a Rudyard Kipling poem and is an inventive song with interesting melodies and naturalistic sound effect evocative of a woodland setting. A fantastic group of songs, and a steal for the price.
B004SBX112|4.0|My kids LOVE this game & thankfully the 3yr old does too. It keeps her occupied in Dr appointments, etc. She learning hand-eye coordination & trying to \\"aim\\" the birds in the right direction.  Anybody can play!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|best game ever! worth every penny! if it were free it would be perfect; however, $0.99 isn't so bad. I recommend this game to everyone!
B0082A3JHQ|2.0|Spent the past 40 some years looking for new Hendrix cuts, hoping to find good new stuff. There is very little that has not been brougt to light.  There are a few good tracks, but much of this are recordings that do not measure up to what has been already released.  But nevertheless, good for the Hendrix historian.
0441013597|5.0|I first read Dune as a teenager, and I have revisited the novel often.  No other work of fiction ever pursuaded my imagination the way that Dune does.  Prepare to re-arrange the order of your list of favorite books, if you decide to read it.  My highest and most enthusiastic recommendation.
0871404133|5.0|Excellent! Deep and far-ranging in scope. This book and \\"Collapse\\" (by Jared Diamond) form a wonderful, non-overlapping set about human societies. There is some material about insect colonies, but this just serves to illustrate social evolutionary principles. This book is about human societies, not insects.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|After reading Book 1 of the Fifty Shades Trilogy, I felt compelled to read the second in the series, Fifty Shades Darker. Although quite well written, it also contains many of the titillating alternate life styles that made the first book so popular. Just when the conclusion is apparent, the \\"lead-in\\" to the third in the series is very evident.  Over all.. a good summer read.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I loved on how the movie captured a great part of the books.  Though, if one has never heard of the book series, one may think that the movie has left a lot of gaps and unanswered questions.  When watching this movie, consider the fact that back in those days, men were already men at an early part of their lives.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|cool fun games but a lot of pop up adds not the best game in the world I say get it if u wont
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It is the one game I have stuck playing. Just wish you could earn more pecans faster.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I read this before I read Point of Retreat, this is the first book of the 2. It was a page turner. I read it after I finished Infidel, which is a heavy read. Sweet and engaging love story.
B001R10BMS|5.0|one of the better bond films. I recently saw a reedited opening from a fan on you tube of what this movie what have been like if it was made in typical bond fashion. And it was quite good. Who knows the way they can make movies today maybe they can come out with an alternate version since EON productions bought the rights to the film maybe it will happen and make it like the rest of the films. I reccommend people to watch it. Go to youtube \\"never say never again offical 007 style opening'\\"
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I lost my copy of Lethal Weapon and was happy to find one on Amazon. Having these again I just put one in my DVD player anytime I want to.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I thought this was a very funny movie.  I watched it with my teen age children and we all laughed hard, out loud. I never saw the origional but we hope they do a sequel!
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Hovering half-way between being serious and being funny--and enjoying every minute of its crazy balancing act--this is a great movie.  A real movie.<br /><br />Given the rarity of good films made in Hollywood these days, I had no reasonable expectations, statistically, for a good film here. So I went into the cinema and hoped for the best, but expected nothing.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I found that \\"Abe Lincoln\\" is 1. a well-acted period film with great sets and costumes, 2. a wildly paced action special effects feast, 3. an effectively witty self-satirical historical rewrite and 4. a gruesomely graphic horror flick!  I don't see this as a perfect film--it's got flaws.  But the handful of flaws that bother me, I can ignore, because this is a film made with a joyous spirit, and the overall structure works well.  I've seen this five times in the theatre at this point. I haven't seen a film that many times theatrically in over twenty years!  I had read the book and enjoyed it, but had no idea what the film version might be like.  As has been noted elsewhere, the book and the movie are two completely different things: The book delivers a more intellectual experience, and the film delivers a more emotional experience.  Writer Seth Grahame-Smith has tailored his book into something simpler and less grim for the screen.  I think the decision to make the film a fun action movie was a smart one.  It's a wild ride.<br /><br />History is transformed into mythic fantasy in this yarn detailing the never-before-told story of Lincoln's lifelong battles with supernatural evil. Indeed, the opening words of narration, \\"History prefers legends to men,\\" express the awareness that events are altered in retrospection, to suit our thirst for myth, for purity of rights and wrongs. But the \\"rewrite\\" that ensues shows us the maddest symbolic extremes.  Is this a commentary about America's changing self-image? An indictment of our entertainment culture's increasing obsession with simplistic heroes, loud noises and glorified bloodshed? A condemnation that is strangely exemplary of the problem?  Without winking, this film makes many sly jabs at the \\"typical,\\" common-denominator, American action film.<br /><br />It's simultaneously silly and profoundly moving--a film so strange that many scratch their heads, but in time, I think, it will come to be regarded as a classic of genre cinema.  In this searing mixture of the real and the unreal, we witness scenes of outlandish fantasy as well as scenes of a young nation being shaped through moral and political conflict. A wide spectrum of emotions is expressed. Sweeping vistas, vital romance, epic battles: It might reasonably be said that this is the \\"Gone with the Wind\\" of vampire films.  There is an ecstasy of absurdity.  It's fun because it's just plain crazy, but in an expensive, lavish, eloquent, opulent way.<br /><br />Yes, like \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" before it, this one brings back memories of the Hammer classic horror films, which, though violent, were elegant and refined, with beautifully written dialogue.  It's a really refreshing change from the crudity and brutal excesses seen in horror films of recent years.  This one goes down smooth.<br /><br />The humor here is pretty subtle, most of the time. This film suggests to the viewer that one of America's greatest Presidents was actually also a fearsome, axe-swinging, monster-slaughtering badass. The story of how all this came to be is lovingly presented as the most serious thing in the world, despite its patent ridiculousness. This \\"straight-faced\\" approach is really the key to the humor, and achieves a smart, sophisticated effect.<br /><br />The Civil War-era story links the intended secession of the Southern states with the rise to power of vampires in those states; so vampirism becomes a metaphor for slavery and man's general inhumanity to himself. The typical horror film focuses on primal fears, and never on issues of morality; so while largely ahorror film, this seeks to turn some basic principles of the horror film sideways. The meddling does not stop there. It is true that the story treats its history elements as \\"flexible material\\" to be modified as necessary for storytelling purposes (is this unexpected for a film with a title like \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\"?). But it is also true that the audience needs to be familiar with the American Civil War, Lincoln, Harriet Tubman, and various other historical personages, in order to comprehend the story and get the jokes. Perhaps it's a sad thing, but whimsical fantasies featuring historical figures (like this film, and the first \\"Bill and Ted\\" film) are most useful in this day and age for acquainting audiences with these figures in the first place.  Inaccurate?  Sure.  But it's still comprehensible only to literate audiences.<br /><br />The film is a creative entity--and, like some of my favorite satire-comedies, seeks to go vigorously against the grain of convention, so audience members expecting the normal \\"action film product\\" are likely to be confused (and when I watched it in theatres, a good many viewers were certainly confused!). \\"Abe Lincoln\\" thinks outside the box and then axe-murders the box.  If you happen to be inside the box, well, you are in trouble.  But sharp viewers who get the joke are rewarded with a stimulating experience.<br /><br />While serving up gaggles of vicious monsters, it unfolds an old-school \\"birth of the hero\\" story that recalls the tone of earlier Technicolor Hollywood epics and historical biopics. \\"Abe Lincoln\\" delivers much, much more than the basic requirements. This is a popcorn film of a higher order.<br /><br />Many laughs, scares, and thrilling moments. Yeah. I loved it.<br /><br />--Rodd Matsuihorror film, this seeks to turn some basic principles of the horror film sideways. The meddling does not stop there.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|While flat on my back for six weeks after suffering a broken ankle, I had plenty of time to satisfy my thirst for reading.  The Lucky One was by far the best book I read!  It is fast-moving, suspenseful, and non predictable.  Easy to get into, the book's quick pace makes it hard to put down.  As odd as it might sound, this is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read, but it definitely won't be my last!  If you are a romantic at heart, you simply must read The Lucky One.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Its a cute little game but its like an EXACT copy of Tiny Monsters. Except for the kinds of dragons, this is exactly like Tiny Monsters. Not cool TeamLava, not cool. and the sad thing is, I LOVE TeamLava! but this disappointed me

0307959856|3.0|P D James is one of the best when it comes to mystery. I have read all of her books. And was anxious to read this one. But I just could not get into it. But this book is not one of her best, it seems to have fallen thru the cracks of good mystery. I think she was trying too hard to blend an old story with a new. To me, it just did not work. At a couple points I just wanted to quit reading but decided since I bought it, I needed to finish. A disappointment.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Love this DVD....I play it when I have guests and they all stop to watch it and it is nice just to play as background music.
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I had purchased this DVD \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" From a vendor through Amazon. The I DVD I received looked exactly like a home made copy. Therefore, I posted a negative rating against the vendor. Amazon informed me that the movie maker released this last issue of this movie like this. A picture of it can be seen in the the ad for the movie. Unbelievable. Therefore,On their word, I'am posting an apology To Amazon and The Vendor.<br />  Arlett Gallagher
B00139XSBA|5.0|I grew up during the space race against Russia. This movie brings back lots of memories on where I was when Alan Shepard made his first trip.  I could and do watch this over and over.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Is this novel worth your time? Yes, it is. It is well written, and her ending is clever and unique.  She creates both the husband and wife in their flawed lives so that they are almost always believable. I would definitely recommend this novel.

0446401307|4.0|Harry Bosch has never failed me since first discovering him after the 1994 Northridge Earthquake in The Last Coyote.  The Overlook shows me that Michael Connelly's ability to have Bosch grow and develop as a long term mystery character is unsurpassed.  Bosch can be hard edged and hard to take with his combativeness, but he follows his gut and doesn't back down and when he needs to relax he puts on some jazz.<br /><br />Connelly is well able to adapt to the times in  The Last Coyote  Harry's house is damaged and fragile from the earthquake which rocked the city and both him and his house are barely hanging on, while in The Overlook Connelly has moved to the modern concerns of  terrorism and Homeland Security. A medical physicist has been seemingly executed by terrorist and radioactive cesium has been stolen from him.<br /><br />For those who relish surprises, this perhaps is not the most challenging mystery as I soon figured out which way it was going.  For those who just love Harry Bosch this is a great one to add to the continuing list.
030758836X|5.0|I'm really surprised at some of the negative views.

B0089BSLUS|5.0|\\"I've always contained your desire to hurt me\\", sings Antony over a gentle piano and majestic strings, and just like that, I am his.  I have had a love/hate relationship with this man's music over the years--fascinated by his unique and lovely voice, alternately frustrated and enchanted but by his excesses--but here in a symphonic setting, he becomes all that I had hoped to hear.  He is intimate here, in full glory, voice slowly unfolding like an orchid, vibrato present but restrained, his sometimes sobbing diction held in check.  The symphony is perfect here as well, lovely and warm.  All these songs are songs that I know well now (except for the incredible title track), and I am glad for that, because I am free to focus on his singing and the arrangements, allowing the music to wrap around me in a langorous, sensual haze.  This haze is interrupted by the 7 minute discussion of how we are all interrelated with the phases of the moon called \\"Future Feminism\\"--listening to that once was interesting, but I won't want to hear it every time I listen to this record.  That quirk is easily fixed through the joy of playlists, but I think that this is his most satisfying record overall.  If you have teetered on the edge of buying an Antony and the Johnsons record, fear not, this is the one that will keep you, fascinate you, enchant you, hypnotize you, and yes, make you grateful for the beauty that is all around. Masterful and wonderful.
B007PBL9KC|4.0|Well written and performed.  Nothing spectacular, lots of nice melodies, lots of full and bright instrumentation.  Only real issue is the lack of harmonizing between the lead vocalists.  It's like a requirement with boy/girl vocal teams.  Other than that it's a great album.  Recommend it if you like folk music.

0062502182|1.0|I almost wish I could give a zero here, but I recognize that the ideas of the author have probably impacted people in ways that were positive for them and for the people around them, while not harming anyone. Compared to many other ideas with a wide dissemination, this is actually pretty good. Now, this said, I could not even bring myself to finish the book. The writing has a complete lack of subtleness, and consists of just one grandiloquent fallacy after another, with an unnecessary use of absolute language. There is a serious lack of questioning or criticism, and a similar excess of earnestness.
030758836X|1.0|I wasted money on this book. Seriously. It is bizarre. I am a seriously educated person, but this book which other reviewers are saying is only for \\"the highly intellectual\\" reader is nuts. The book has two very unlikable characters who have a bad marriage. I can deal with that. I can't deal with or wrap my head around how unreal the story unfolds about halfway through the book. It was something out of a lifetime Saturday movie - not believable. Jodi Picoult....PLEASE write some more books!
B008JH5CVS|5.0|Very fun and entertaining scifi action flick, lead actor (guy) is great.  I almost hope they will make a few sequels using the character he played.

B0018AM1YY|5.0|An absolute must for everyone that has been a life long fan.  Contains as many classics that could fit.  Sounds great in my Amazon Kindle Fire.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I Love this movie there are so many things happening in it that replay value is high. The story is well thought out the acting is top notch. Special effects are awesome. With every thing this movie has to offer what sold me is the dialog & dynamics between the actors. It was ashame that the TV series Firefly for which this movie comes from was cancelled. I truly believe that the series Firefly would have been what the Star Wars fans would have wanted from Mr. Lucas if Star Wars was ever made into a TV series.
0061726834|5.0|I was intrigued from the very first page of Deliruim. The idea of love being considered a disease (amor deliria nervosa) is just fascinating--especially when you examine the symptoms of love because they are actually pretty similar to certain diseases (distraction, racing heart, preoccupation). What a brilliant concept to write about!<br /><br />Even though I loved the concept, Delirium did not truly captivate me until the second half of the novel. Delirium is primarily a character driven novel, which is synonymous with slow in the beginning. While I do love character driven novels, I always find myself trudging through them in the beginning. You need to be attached to the characters in order to enjoy this type of novel, and that attachment typically takes several chapters to develop.<br /><br />The plot really starts to pick up in the second half of the story. Had I not loved Alex and Lena, I would not have enjoyed it nearly as much. However, since I absolutely love them, the novel was so intense! I was on edge every single moment. I needed to know what would happen--I could not tear myself away from the story. The world building was great, but the character development is where Lauren Oliver really shines.<br /><br />Delirium features a great set of characters, a fascinating world, and one of the best romances ever. Oliver proves that amor deliria nervosa is worth fighting for and that indifference is far worse than hate. The world building was amazing, the characters were even better, and oh my god the romance. Delirium is definitely a must read for fans of love stories and dystopia.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Saw this at the Imax theatre. Hubby and I thought it was terrific!<br />  I am sure the Imax effects heightened the enjoyment to some extent. But<br />it IS a great movie. Don't think you will find it a bit dull or \\"long winded\\".<br />  I have pre-ordered it from Amazon.com for when it comes<br />out in blu-ray. It will be a wonderful addition to my blu-ray collection.
0062073281|4.0|The Fame Game was just awesome. Lauren Conrad has grown tremendously as a writer, but still maintains that light-hearted, dramatic quality that keeps the pages turning quickly. The Fame Game is a spin-off series from Conrad's L.A.Candy series, so you will probably want to read the L.A Candy books before diving into this novel.<br /><br />The Fame Game is another reality show that follows Madison and Gaby from L.A. Candy, as well as two new characters--Kate and Carmen. While Kate was my favorite character because she is so down to earth and a genuinely nice character, I have to admit that Madison has grown on me. Conrad adds much more depth to Madison's character, and you can't help but sympathize with her.<br /><br />The best part of The Fame Game is that it feels original. While reading L.A. Candy, I was constantly trying to figure out who was who on \\"The Hills.\\" The Fame Game feels more like a work of Conrad's imagination. Of course, I imagine that the knowledge of fame-hungry up-and-comers and reality television comes directly from Conrad's own experiences.<br /><br />As with all thrilling novels, The Fame Game ends on a cliff-hanger that will have you rushing out to buy Starstruck, the next novel in the series (slated to be released November 2012). I know I can't wait to find out what happens next--particularly for Madison and Kate. The Fame Game is the start of what is sure to be an amazing series!

One thing I'll add about the lanyard, if you thread it through both slots in the base and put an overhand knot in the end, it solves the problem of the light being unstable when standing on end due to the lanyard. Item and service are both 5 stars!

0143121316|5.0|Henry Kissinger's - 'On China' has been one of the most insightful, thought-provoking, detailed reads I have had the privilege of having in a while. From someone who admittedly had only a cursory understanding of China / Chinese History prior to beginning this book, pieces of the tapestry of this ancient civilization are finally falling into place.<br /><br />Given several detailed reviews by previous readers, I will attempt to focus instead on highlighting some of this book's successes, and areas where I felt it was somewhat limited.<br /><br />SUCCESSES:<br />- High-Level Overview of Chinese History - The book begins its journey through China's history some 5000 years ago, skimming through the Warring States period and subsequent Dynasties before starting to dive into detail around the 19th and 20th centuries - Colonial Rule, Revolution, Formation of Taiwan, Cold War Politics, through to Modern Day China<br />- Profiles each of the key figures in Chinese Politics particularly over this later period, including Chiang Kai-Shek, Chairman Mao (Zedong), Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaopeng, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao etc<br />- Describes Chinese Philosophy and 'Thinking' that affects its political, economic, social and military positions<br />- Describes the American position and primary political concerns (particularly during the Cold War era) and its impact on managing relationships between China and the USSR<br />- Describes most every major international incident involving China (during Kissinger's time in office)- including the Cultural Revolution, Formation of Taiwan and the three Taiwan Strait escalations, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Tiannemen Square etc<br />- Describes personal and working relationships between American and Chinese politicians and diplomats - style of politics, negotiation tactics, diplomacy etc<br /><br />LIMITATIONS:<br />- Skims through the earlier part of Chinese History - (although focusing on only later Chinese history in detail admittedly provides this book with much needed focus)<br />- Focuses primarily on politics and the politicians - i.e the people Kissinger was most intimately involved with (on both sides of the Pacific). Little exposition on cultural, social, economic issues or on other non-political 'leaders' within China at the time leaves one feeling that a book on the history of the United States (1960s - 1990s)could similarly be written by purely focusing on JFK, Nixon, Reagan etc.<br />- Ends abruptly with the emergence of Modern Day China in the late 1990s - 2000's and does not delve into current flashpoints in US-Sino relations - military buildup in SE Asia, Space Race, IP / Corporate Technology Theft, Trade Deficits and Currency Manipulation, Financing and ownership of Soverign Debt, Resource Accumulation etc. - leaving a lot to ponder and reflect on.<br /><br />In summary, this book is expertly written by one of America's greatest statemen - it is well researched, provides a wealth of information on Chinese history and politics, and allows us a window into Kissinger's personal style as well. It does have some limitations and personal biases which individual readers will feel differently about but overall, this is a must read for anyone with even a passing interest in China, its history, Cold War politics, or Kissinger. Highly Recommended A++s this book with much needed focus)<br />- Focuses primarily on politics and the politicians - i.e the people Kissinger was most intimately involved with (on both sides of the Pacific).

B005SZEFH6|5.0|I first purchased \\"The Tao of Jeet Kune Do\\" in the early 70's, I believe, back when I was young and strong and a dedicated Martial Artist. In my school my sifu would occasionally amuse himself by sparring with one of the upper classmen, usually one handed while he instructed the class at the same time. He never lost, or was seriously challenged. After I purchased this book, I found I applied the principals MORE than the actual techniques and I became the student the sifu couldn't fight one handed anymore. The martial wisdom that Bruce Lee offers in this book is as invaluable to life as the arts. The world suffered from the loss of Bruce Lee much more than it can know.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I didn't read Ender until I was an adult, and while I've a few beloved sic-fi and fantasy books in my collection, most of the 100+ books I read each year are a blend of serious nonfiction, \\"literary\\" fiction, mystery, and classics. So I'm not a sci-fi apologist, a male, a techie, or any of the other stereotypes you might envision.  This is one of my favorite books of all time, of any genre. It works on almost every level- its a classic coming-of-age novel, deeply humane, engaging, exciting and poignant. I've read it many times over the years and it has never palled. (well, I hate the graphic novel). Over time, I've read most of Card's work though I've stopped as he's slipped more and more deeply into a jingoistic conservatism that is the antitheses of Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. This book embodies love, faith and courage in a unique way. Whatever has led Mr. Card to see the world more darkly over tie, his early vision of human nature at its best is lovely. So, from a reader who values Sense and Sensibiity as well as Dune, my advice it=read this book.

0393339785|4.0|Amazon puts all reviews for all editions (both print and audio) in the same bucket, so it is necessary to ignore comments about production quality.  I am reviewing the edition pictured, which is the Norton 2011 paperback, roughly a 5 1/2\\" x 8 1/4 \\" size with an easily readible font.<br /><br />This is not the best of the Wooster and Jeeves novels, but it has its moments.  It is the case of the Gussie Fink-Nottle Affair as narrated by Bertie Wooster.  Bertie has been on a vacation to the south coast of France along with his aunt Dahlia and cousin Angela, where they also encountered Madelin Bassett.  Upon returning to London, Bertie discovers that his chum, Gussie Fink-Nottle, is strongly attracted to Madelin but can't seem to manage to make his feelings known.  Bertie and Jeeves have different ideas about how to bring this about.  Bertie sends Fink-Nottle off to be a houseguest at his aunt Dahlia's country estate, where Madelin is also a house guest.  Ah, the best laid plans of mice and men... - aunt Dahlia compares Bertie to Attila the Hun for his ability to disrupt the household.<br /><br />Events are compounded when Bertie arranges for Fink-Nottle to take on the duties of presenting the year end prizes to the boys at Market Snodsbury Grammar School (a task that Bertie is trying to avoid).  The decision to give Fink-Nottle some courage by spiking his orange juice with some gin takes a wrong turn when Fink-Nottle has also decided to take a drop or two (or maybe a half bottle) of whiskey to stiffen up his backbone.  One is reminded of the story of the minister who is advised to sip a bit of spirits to ease his nerves before giving a sermaon, who chug-a-lugs a glassful instead.  Strange things can happen when a man completely loses his inhibitions.<br /><br />Jeeves of course, comes through to save the day.  It is the usual humor, with strange names, mentions of the Drones Club, etc.  It was not a fast reading book, and can get a bit tedious at points, but it is OK, with a good storyline.ith a good storyline.

0307346617|4.0|While the first couple of chapters don't have a lot of action, it's a good telling of the horrors of the zombie war!  The humor was a bit dry and I liked the cynicism in some of the characters, although most had that wry feeling, but overall good novel.  Once the hubby's done with the Survival Guide, we're switching again!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I can't say enough great things about this case. I was a little anxious about purchasing it based on previous reviews in regard to sound quality and volume. But I have been extremely pleased with every aspect of this case, and zero issues with sound or volume. I listen to music very frequently on this and you couldn't even tell there was a cover on it if you didn't know.<br /><br />I had to purchase this case out of necessity. After my toddler dropped my second iPhone in the toilet (drooled all over the first, killing the motherboard), I knew I needed a heavy duty case. This case has not disappointed. It's not too bulky and clunky like the Otter Box my hubs has, nor annoying sticky like that case.<br /><br />It's been in the rain (no swims in the toilet...yet), bounced from the jogging stroller, fallen from my pocket... You get the idea. I'm rough on my phones. And this one has held up beautifully with not even a scratch. Okay, maybe a small scratch or two, but I'm not complaining.<br /><br />It doesn't have the serious scratch problems previous reviewers mentioned either.<br />My only issue with it is the clear cover can be a bit sticky when typing so it's not nearly as sensitive as without the case. But I'll gladly take that trade off to keep my phone working!<br /><br />Overall, this is a great investment. Wish I had just purchased this the first time instead of paying monthly insurance...and then two insurance claims. :-/

B004LROMX4|4.0|Falling Skies is a good show and I was glad to see it get a bluray release.<br /><br />Picture quality is average (at best) for a 2011 bluray, but considering the show is literally a dark/murky show; that is to be expected.<br /><br />Audio is above average, with the show having a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.<br /><br />The only thing I can really knock is the cheap cardboard case.<br /><br />I'd love for the blurays to be housed in your standard plastic case. But in a world where companies are pinching pennies and worrying about their carbon offsets; like it or not, this seems to be the new standard.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I had high hopes for this novel. I chose to ignore the less than favorable reviews, especially those about the ending as I don't always need a tidy bow wrapped conclusion to make me happy. I was glad I followed my instinct up until two thirds of the way through the book. Ms. Flynn does give her characters engaging and entertaining voices, despite them both being thoroughly unlikeable. The dialogue is realistic and sharp. However, after the first two thirds, the book takes a trip to the land of make believe. The plot skews from page turning excitement to \\"no freaking way this would ever happen.\\" And then after the author shoves all the unbelievable plot in your face, the book just stops. I can't even call it an ending because nothing really did end except for my enjoyment of this book. Talk about unsatisfying. I'd still be willing to give another of her books a try as her writing style is entertaining but I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody.

0547569653|4.0|Eat and Run was an inspiring read, but for me also represented moments of feeling overwhelmed by such athletic feats. The recipes included at the end of each chapter sounded delicious. However, much like Scott Jurek's running ability exceeds my capabilities so does his cooking prowess. I am a rather simple being and often prefer 5 ingredients or less :-).  The book is a great read much like the author is a seemingly great human being.
B003Y5H542|4.0|This movie is one of my most favorite animated movies. The animations and details of the characters and settings is incredible! This style of animation is what sets this mObie apart from the rest. Great story and plot are another big plus from me. Character voices were perfect except Johnny Depp. He should've got a little more into a character instead of a regular voice.
B003TH3Q48|5.0|Although this episode is not one of the strongest story wise it really shows the view what they can expect from this sereies action wise.

A character is also introduced who is foreshadowed and reappears in season 2.<br /><br />Hope this helps, Igor
0374530718|2.0|Earlier this year, I was reading some assorted works of Plato. A lot of people give you a crazy eye when you read old philosophy outside of a college course (at least in my circles).  Someone noticed what I was reading and recommended I pick up Sophie's World. A novel about philosophy sounds like a terrific idea. It's not really.<br /><br />I did enjoy the simplified descriptions of the history of philosophy as told to Sophie (and Hilde I suppose). This was beneficial but not thrilling.<br /><br />When it came to the story line, a lot is left to be desired. I finished the book of course, because it was good enough that you wanted to see what happened. I am not able to recommend this book.
B003TH41H4|5.0|This brilliant first episode of Legend of the Seeker is what hooks many to the series due to the fact that it is able to attatch the viewer almost instantly with it's entertaining and engaging content. This episode immediatly engages us when we a character that we know nothing of is struck down (Kahlans sister). This is only one of the many examples that makes this sereies so great. The episode seems to create a setting for the series all in just one episode giving us foundations of the plot, setting and characterisation. This episode does this without giving the feeling that it is rushed which is quite a magnificent task. If this is your first time watching this series i urge you to continue.<br /><br />I hope this helps, Igor
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I very rarely pay for apps, but buying the full version of White Noise is definitely worth $1.99 and more! I was so impressed with the number of options and even more to download! I introduced the rain on deck (my favorite rain sound--downloaded) to my baby every time he slept and he now falls asleep so quickly to the sound and it filters out all the noise of people talking, etc. in our house. It's really relaxing for my husband and I, too. He also likes the train sound, but that gets a little annoying after awhile :). I promise you will not be disappointed with this app.

0553582038|4.0|I just started and am roughly 250 pages into the book. I wanted to say one thing that has been on my mind...<br /><br />The book starts out a bit slow but not lacking. There has been so much that goes on in the previous three it is nice to have a bit of a slow down to develop the remaining characters. The war is finally coming to an end and life is, albeit not perfect, returning to normal.<br /><br />I will add to this review later after I finish the book, but for those reading the reviews of \\"too slow\\" or \\"nothing is happening\\" understand what has happened.<br /><br />I think of this now as the uneasy peace following Germany's defeat in WW2 before the cold war officially began.<br /><br />**Edit 8/17/12**<br /><br />Ok, almost done and I am leaving it with four stars. The book is really quite good with lots of character building on the other side. As I mentioned before, everyone is at a peace and the fighting is done. Westeros is returning to a bit or normalcy. However the ice is beginning to break underneath their feet. Its tougher to get through than the first three but still the amazing high attention to detail we have come to expect from Martin. It starts a bit slow then picks up but slows again. Hopefully A Dance With Dragons will pick back up though.

B000286RNY|3.0|\\"Shaolin Soccer\\" is just one of those films you should never go into expecting some great, ground breaking cinema.  Just look at the title, can we really expect much?  But, with all that, it is still a very entertaining and unique film with a wonderful premise and awesome action...and even some amazing lessons to be learned along the way.  This is, in many ways, \\"The Little Giants\\" if they were older and Asian.<br /><br />FOR CONCERNED PARENTS AND FOLKS:<br />You really don't have much to worry about.  No sex, no nudity, only comic violence (this is soccer...and a martial arts flick), no real innuendos (the only instance that can be taken that way isn't really if taken in context...it's the egg scene if you want to look that up).  All in all, it's safe and sound.<br /><br />PLOT (NO SPOILERS):<br />The basic premise is \\"what would happen if a poor, rundown (but aspiring) Kung Fu practitioner ran into a soccer coach?\\"  There's not much else to it as far as the complete story arc is concerned.  But it is executed convincingly (for what it is) and very well.  Tinge of romance, issues of letting fame and wealth go to your head, themes of controlled strength abound in the film.  Expect to see a lot of old school martial arts idioms...some of which are intentionally exaggerated for affect.  The pacing is quite slow and gradual though...this is definitely still an Asian film and not a comedic Jim Carey film.  Still, the film was very creatively done with many funny moments that had me rolling.<br /><br />CHINESE ORIGINAL FILM CUT VS US THEATRICAL:<br />Ok, it should be noted that the DVD carries both the original Chinese cut of the film as well as the US theatrical cut.  Only the US cut has English dubs to go with it.  Well, I'm on the fence with this.  It's cool to hear the Chinese...but it's also hilarious to have the English dubs.  With the English Dubs, it plays just like the classic \\"bad dubs\\" of early martial arts films...and it seems quite intentional.  Still, in the end, though I've seen both, I would greatly recommend watching the Chinese original cut, since it fills in gaps in the story much more.<br /><br />ALL IN ALL:<br />This is a fun and amazingly humorous light film.  It does have some touching moments and great and deeper lessons...but is very much slapstick through an through.  It is important to note, again, that some may be turned off by its slower pace.  Still, it should be seen at least once.e end, though I've seen both, I would greatly recommend watching the Chinese original cut, since it fills in gaps in the story much more.<br /><br />ALL IN ALL:<br />This is a fun and amazingly humorous light film.

0439023521|3.0|Okay, so I finally broke down and read this book.  Honestly, its a decent book, but I have no clue what all the hype is about...<br /><br />The story is about a teenager in a future world where America is now broken up into Districts that are ruled by the Capitol.  As part of their punishment for rising up against their rulers, the Hunger Games are played.  Teenagers are picked by a lottery from the Districts and are forced to fight to the death in a dangerous outdoor arena.  The odds are stacked against them because the people running the Games keep changing things to keep it interesting for the viewers.<br /><br />The main character, Katniss, volunteers to go in stead of her younger sister and Peeta is the male chosen from the same District.  Its obvious to the reader that he loves her, but she takes a long time to figure that out and even longer to realize that she has feelings for him.  They are billed as a love interest during the Game, the first ever.<br /><br />Overall, its not a bad read...save that its hard to like many of the characters because they come off a bit flat.  The Game itself is predictible.  Perhaps I expected too much, but if this book hinted at the end that this would lead into Katniss becoming the head of a revolution against the Captiol, then I would be happier with it.  I haven't read the second book, so perhaps that's where the author is heading.<br /><br />My main concern with this is the idea of having teenagers playing a \\"Game\\" where they murder each other.  Yes, this is a future world where life seems cheap at times, but one wonders at what impression this gives to teenagers who read it.<br /><br />There also didn't seem much in the way of explanation over why the Districts were closed off from the surrounding countryside where there was, obviously, still food to be had.  Or why they weren't allowed to farm.  Perhaps, if it had been made clear that areas of the land were radioactive or something?  But there was no sense of this.  Wasthis just a means of the Capitol further controlling them?  That wasn't made clear if so.  And why keep a population hungry when it doesn't have to be...that's just asking for trouble in the long run.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book for what it was.  But its just an okay book in my mind.  Not something I would necessarily recommend to anyone under the age of 16 or 17 due to the teenager on teenager violence that, honestly, we don't need to glorify.
B0070XFNDE|3.0|Not nearly as good as the previous ones.Good humor, always well written.However, the plot line is poor, not much is happening and the ending implies a \\"to be continued\\" when the story barely started.

B00890JFMW|5.0|[[ASIN:B00890JFMW Collection]]<br /><br />Vangelis' wonderful new compilation album. Absolutely the best way to get to know this composer, whose timelessness is reconfirmed. The combination of tracks works like a charm, and very few of the really famous tracks are missing. Of course, a lot of great work has to be left out, even for a double CD, but a compilation should never be more than a great starting point.<br /><br />There's something extra for the avid fans as well: The Blade Runner main titles finally include the spectacular start of the movie, which was never before released, and Line Open is pretty rare. Finally there is a completely new track, called \\"Remembering\\". Great material, both relaxing and inspiring.<br /><br />The tracks are mostly separated (except for the occasional sound effect to break the silence), sound quality is of course sublime. Both CDs are filled to the top. This is great value for money!<br /><br />Together with the brand-new Chariots of Fire stage play soundtrack release, hitting the market on the very same day as \\"The Collection\\", this is proving to be a good summer for Vangelis music. Enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have not read a book in years. In have 2 small children and was always saying I didn't have the time. Friends have been bugging me to read the trilogy. I avoided it because I thought from all the discussion that it would be some kind of smutty novel. So I finally broke down and got all the books on my Android. I read them all in 10 days. They were the best. It was so great to loose myself in their world...it did have a great deal of sex but it was fun & the story was so addictive! I would highly recommend this book to anyone....well maybe not my mother....lol! My only regret was reading them so fast!
B008FOB2B4|5.0|[[ASIN:B008FOB2B4 Chariots of Fire: The Play]]<br /><br />I had a hard time imagining how the Chariots of Fire material could be re-envisioned, while both respecting the original material and not turning into a parody of the music from 1981. In hindsight, I now wonder: Why did I doubt Vangelis would hit the hammer straight on its head?<br /><br />Chariots of Fire (The Play) is a wonderful new album. The few tracks included from the original album were updated ranging from slightly to heavily, while some of the themes are used in the new material. At the same time there is a big bunch of completely new themes and tracks, and it all works together as if time did not pass. It's not that the new music is in the style of the old tracks. I hear no CS80 or any of the defining instruments of the original soundtrack. It's just that it works!<br /><br />The power of this album is incredible. Vangelis thunders away as if he's reaching for an Olympic medal himself. Of course, at other times he rests and quietly brings out the moods and emotions of the silence before (and after) the storm.<br /><br />Great results! The album may not be as polished as some of this other albums, but this makes it feel as if you are sitting right in front of him, while he's flying his fingers over the keys.<br /><br />With such great results......<br /><br />Let the Olympics begin! Now we already have something to remember them by.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|In the interest of being able to have an informed opinion on the hottest property in publishing so far this year I decided to read this drivel. Well I started it anyway. After the 21+ year old protagonist looses her virginity to the helicopter pilot/concert pianist/billionaire/control freak/hung like a horse/perfect human being I gave up. I appreciate that I'm not its target market but I would seriously doubt the intelligence of anyone who enjoyed this crap.<br /><br />If you want to read a novel which explores the shades of female sexuality do yourself a great big favour and read The Bride Stripped Bare.
B0080BFWAE|1.0|It's hard to understand, but this Blu-ray disk is worse than the DVD.  The video is extremely grainy.  I compared it to the DVD, which I own, and the DVD is better.  I'm sending it back, hoping that I received a bad copy.  If not, I'm surprised that Disney (Touchstone) would release such a inferior product.  Even the audio was not up to Blu-ray quality.  On my surround sound 5.1 system, the video only played in stereo.  In addition, there are no \\"extras\\" at all.  I was hoping for some comments by the excellent actors, or Chris Columbus, the director of the first Harry Potter films.  Nothing.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Gotta say that for someone that has an early 2000's SUV I have envied all my friends with new cars and handsfree (and earplug free) phone conversations while driving.  Cant complaint one bit about this product.  Its very easy to use, it has a car charger (but the batt life is great)no backfeed, sounds great and no one has complaint about my side of the conversation.  If you leave it on, as soon as you get back in your car, it recognizes the phone and it makes a beep sound (great for people like me with huge purses and it takes forever to realize if you have or not your cellphone with you).  ALso you can answer it from the buddy bluetooth, so you dont go crazy looking for your cellphone.  I will be purchasing more of these... for some of my friends that have complimented it.  Also the car charger is well made so it doesnt damages your batt. car plug.  I strongly recommend if you are searching for a good way to tlak on the phone while driving.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I really liked the first half of this book and then wham it took a turn I wasn't expecting and I really had a hard time with the second half. The ending actually made me irritated. Not too happy with this one. Interesting and sort of dark humor. Didn't live up to the reviews in my opinion.
B006MPKDUE|5.0|I have been reading the Michael Connelly books in order of writing and publishing. Once I start a book it enthrals me almost immediately and the only joy in finishing is knowing there is another one to follow. Wonderful writer and reading them in order really imbeds the characters so that each book is easily followed.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Not a page turner as I had expected. Maybe I had anticipated a quick read that I was glued to. I've put it down several times and started something else to read. I am determined to finish it since I paid so much for it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is unlike any other it is fun, creative, and I enjoy it people who get this game I promise you that you will not regret getting this free game. You will play it everyday so enjoy.
B004GKMUTO|2.0|First up I did not like this, it is probably the most boring thing I have ever had the misfortune to happen on. Also, and forgive me for this, I read only half and therefore may not be entitled to comment. The story could be interesting, if you can find it in the flow of verbage. I gave 2 stars because the writing is excellent and if you like literary rambling then you may well enjoy. I read to be entertained , this did not entertain me. The author indulges in long diversions and it can take pages after pages just to add one thought to the story. It has lots of reviews so no point in my rehashing the plot - and in the interests of brevity I will keep this succinct. This is a book to me that is over written, one that will satisfy the intellectuals with lots of fodder for interpretation, discussion and general cleverness. But I was bored, perhaps I am too dumb. But I am too old to let that bother me anymore.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I got this app cause it was free...then played it for my six month old when he was fussy...and went to sleep minutes!!! he was awoken later and the app put him back to sleep....I love it! It was even soothing to hear while the baby was listening.

030758836X|2.0|Gillian Flynn's novel,Gone Girl, falls short on so many levels. Though stylistically well-crafted, the novel leaves the reader with the bitter realization that he/she has been as psychically abused and manipulated as poor emasculated Nick. The novel fails to reach a catharsis for the reader UNLESS that catharsis is the realization that reading a Flynn novel sets one up for a colossal disappointment.  Obviously Ms. Flynn is a talented writer; I wonder why then the ending was so slapdash. Surely, Bony Meroni could have discovered that Desi had an ironclad alibi for the day he was supposed to have kidnapped Amy. Or Jacqueline, Desi's mother, could have admitted that her darling son had been sharing her bed on the day in question--any alternate ending would have been better than how Flynn leaves her readers.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|very addictive. love that they added new boards. I hope they continue to add more levels. definitely recommend it to my friends
1609611543|5.0|If you want to lose weight, sleep better, buy this book!  I have only been using the no wheat plan for 30 days.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I bought Fifty Shades of Grey as an impulse buy, I was going on a trip and needed something to read and was intrigued by the hype. In short the story is about a young girl who finds herself interested in a charming, wealthy man who has only engaged in BSDM relationships in the past. The book continues on to develop how and if these two very different people can seem to have a functional relationship.<br /><br />This book is interesting and I would recommend buying it if you are curious as to why an almost erotica novel has become commonplace. There are definitely in depth described sex scenes, if I had to give a number I would say maybe 20-30% of text is vivid descriptions. Although if you are looking for some deep, plot twisting story, 50 Shades of Grey wont suffice, it is simple and easy to follow.<br /><br />I went on to read 50 Shades Darker and am on 50 Shades Freed, though stopped reading it. They are essentially reincarnations of the 50 Shades of Grey, the same plot, same phrases - it gets old pretty quickly.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|only 90 floors, some levels are very hard some are rather easy (1,11, 67 and so on), some clues are way out from left field, fun time waster, def needs an update, and finish the rest of the levels. I will change my review to five stars when that happens.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|A good book. Not particularly well written but a good plot and I look forward to the next two books. I'm sure this will sell tons of books. I wish I was in the 'sex toy' business!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is awesome and thought app and I love it so much that I don't have anything bad two say about it :)
B000J10ERO|4.0|This was the first movie that my son was old enough to attend a midnight premiere with me, so I'll always have somewhat of a soft spot for it.  It's also the reason I bought it for my son.<br /><br />By comparison to Nolan's near perfect Batman trilogy you could easily dismiss this movie.  But it shouldn't be compared to that.  This movie, more than anything, could be viewed as a \\"love letter\\" to the Richard Donner movies featuring Christopher Reeves.<br /><br />Between Routh and Spacey's spot in impersonations of their characters and the story line pulled straight from the original movies (we'll pretend Superman IV never happened), it's like the years between films never happened.<br /><br />This film speaks to a certain audience, that being the folks that grew up with the original pictures.  I have to admit that when I heard that iconic music again, I got chills!<br /><br />With that out of the way, there were a few disappointments.  Lois Lane and \\"other\\" plot developments didn't work.  Kate Bosworth never really brings Lois to life, and the other \\"family\\" developments remove the film too far from the mainstream Superman mythos.<br /><br />The camp of the original characters is captured, but some of the subject matter and filming style don't quite jibe with that light-heartedness.<br /><br />Like I said, it's a nice piece of nostaligia, and fits well with the older movies, but doesn't serve to bring the Superman franchise forward.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to seeing what \\"Man of Steel\\" can bring to the plate.<br /><br />As for the DVD presentation, the extras on the 2nd DVD are a nice addition and really serves to show how the cast & crew hold the original films in such reverence.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|A second rate villian turns out to be a first rate adoptive father even though he<br />lives in an \\"Addams-esque\\" home filled with bombs, rocket and Minons that look like<br />snack food....
B004XXIHS2|2.0|I really wanted to like this.  Ira Levin had written Rosemary's Baby, The Stepford Wives, and the Boys from Brazil.  And I'd read again and again, something to the effect of...  If you want to write a thriller or crime noir, first read A Kiss Before Dying.<br /><br />Maybe you had to be there in 1953.  But for someone born after that and living in the 21st century, I was bored.  The main character is reprehensible from the get-go.  I didn't feel for him, I didn't care what happened to him, I didn't care about his life or his story.  I slogged through it to discover a couple of twists, but I didn't care.  I saw the Twilight Zone growing up, and later the Sixth Sense and Fight Club.  We've seen twists before.<br /><br />I'll find my noir elsewhere.
B007NWCZR4|5.0|...it's so much fun to turn over a rock and discover new sounds by these boys who i can never really get enough of....many of the tunes really aren't that new, but my ears hadn't laid lobes on them.  i had a blast adding even a couple of new favorites to my growing PSB Fav List.  i think you will too.  ~s
B005DOKL3E|5.0|This case fits my KF like a glove! I won't complain about zipping it up. You just have to make sure the KF all the way in and snug. It zips up nicely.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not only was this a great story line (even though I didn't care too much for the sex scenes) it was very well written.  I couldn't wait to read the other two books.  I feel a withdrwal now that the books are finished.
034580404X|5.0|I had very little expectations when my daughter kept asking me to buy and read these books.  I was a little shocked at the content, but after falling into the story line I fell in love with the entire series.  I'm not one for romance novels, but these books have changed my mind.  Very erotic and page turning.  I highly reccommend to the women in love and for the single ladies who might want to explore.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I bought this book on a bit of a whim, and the timing was a little bad. I ended up reading the entire book in like 2 days without actually having 2 days to afford to be spent reading! It's very difficult to put down! I'm picky when it comes to writing and normally I find a lot of \\"romance\\" novels rely on simply having a good story line, and therefore the writing style is lacking. This book was not the case. Jamie's writing style is neat and well put together and a very good read! Highly recommend!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy it. I'm a Catholic, but has lost quite a bit of faith in my religion. I hope to gain it back by reading or listening to the Bible a couple times a day. the context is a bit old fashioned but am beginning to understand more clearly.  I give it two thumbs up!!
1608871045|5.0|This is a must for Bat fans everywhere.  It's as if Bruce and Alfred kept a diary, and includes great comments and post-it notes from gadget-maker extraordinaire Lucius Fox.  Photos of all the incredible vehicles, as well as the cool toys. This amazing tome covers the villains, including their demented backstories.  It has maps of the Bat Cave, as well as the temporary quarters from TDK.  There are extensive Gotham PD files and surveillance photos from when Thomas and Martha Wayne were gunned down by Joe Chill.  Also includes color pictures and chapters on all of the rogues, from Scarecrow to the Joker to Bane.  Five stars out of five.  D-Kat sez \\"check it out.\\"
0345803485|1.0|I thought the writing was redundant and poorly written.  It certainly is \\"Mommy Porn.\\"  I read two to three books a week and couldn't get through this in two weeks.  Very little story with repeated S&M.  Ugh. And I'm not prudish!
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|The magnitude of violence is assume and the suspense leaves you guessing and wanting more.  I would recommend this movie to all.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Linkin Park has always come out with a great album, ever since the days of Hybrid THeory. not since Meteora have Linkin Park made such a rich mix of music. Great job!
B003ABZDGM|5.0|I decided to write this review because I had no idea what the deluxe edition contained and wanted to let others know. It obviously contains the LP's, which are very good quality compared to other vinyls I own. It's in a bifold case with the extended artwork on the front and additional artwork on the inside and back. The LP's are each in a white sleeve, but also come with an additional artwork sleeve (one with the lyrics and the other with album credits and such). Nothing else is included.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's worth the extra $20 if you prefer the better quality (physical and audio) and a tad more artwork.
B007SHW33K|5.0|By far the most captivating novel by JG. A definite page-turner. A must read. An interesting thing was that my son had seen the move (1996 with Matthew McConaughey, Samuel L Jackson, Sandra Bullock and Donald Sutherland) and I read the book, and it was then that I realized the movie had missed a lot, but I still would like to see the movie, I think it should be interesting.

055358202X|5.0|The beauty of Game of Thrones is that GRRM creates a new world that I can imagine myself to be a part of<br />While the plot twists might not happen as much as they did before, this shouldn't be the only thing that people judge.<br /><br />Let me give an example first and then explain: when the Reynes of Castamere (the song) is mentioned in the book, a ton of different thoughts and emotions come into my head. I know that the song commemorates a family that tried to defy the Lannisters and that it represents Tywin Lannister's iron will and ability to rule rationally and without any emotions. The song also makes me sad because I know that the Reynes of Castamere were ALL killed because of their rebellion. I also know that the song (and the actual event) is one reason why the Lanniesters are so well respected and feared and why loyalty to a Lannister is considered to be very important.<br /><br />The fact that ONE SINGLE SONG can inspire so much in me is indicative of the beauty of GRRM's writing. And all these facts about the Reynes of Castamere were not given to the reader in one chapter or paragraph. I only figured them out from bits and pieces strewn throughout all five books. These subtle details are the beauty of G.O.T (try reading the description of food, even the attention to that is amazing and allows the reader to picture himself at a Westerosi dinner table)<br />Now I think about the Reynes of Castamere as a Westerosi would and the fact that GRRM can do this is amazing<br /><br />I admit that the plot moves slower in this book (there are some great twists, but toward the end). This book is more of a setup book IN TERMS OF PLOT. But in terms of the engrossing, epic experience of Game of Thrones, the book is just as good as the others if not better.<br /><br />People focus too much on plot, but Game of Thrones is much more than that. If you want a book that moves quickly read something else. Instead of thinking of Game of Thrones as a book, it is better to think of it as an immersive experience and the books should be judged on more than just the overarching plot.

B000AJIF4E|4.0|I have owned these before and missed them bad.  As far as sound goes, they're very flat with great response in the lows. They sound better than headphones costing twice as much with little coloration of sound. I have had very succesful mixes using only these. Would highly recommend these, especially for the money.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Great game, very addictive, colorful with interesting enemies and characters. The game crashes every two to three weeks and you lose all of your progress. The game can be beaten with patience and no actual money spent, which is good because if you spend any money you are still subject to lose all of your progress along with any money spent. A great free game. Do Not Spend Any Money on this game until the developers fix the crash and reset problem.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This app makes my ASUS Transformer a road-warrior tool:  it allows me to create content easily.  Granted that it is not a full-blown office programme, and will not deal with complex formatting.  But as a Office app, this app reads everything I have thrown at it from Microsoft.<br /><br />Nothing is perfect, and this does not handle the microsoft core fonts well - but that might be a OS problem.  I therefore use it to create content, and then get back to the office, and use Microsoft Office to clean up the document.

B004V5A7K8|5.0|I do not automatically give 5 stars simply because I really enjoy a game. This game gets 5 because it works well. It is responsive with NO lag on my Kindle Fire. It is fun. It is graphically pleasing. And it keeps me coming back for more.<br /><br />Make sure you try the free version to test out the responsiveness of the paddle on you device. A small caveat. I have to pause the game at times in order to clean my screen to regain fluid movement of the paddle. This is not a problem with the game. It is a problem with the sweat from my finger.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great Breakout game, this is it!

I am SUPER glad that I did. WOW!! COULD NOT STOP READING!!! These books have it all mystery, action, love and AWESOME plot. I LOVED ALL 4 BOOKS THUS FAR BY JAMIE. Thank you Jamie for the last week. I have consumed every moment into reading..trust me my house is begging for attention....but saddly it may have to wait I think I may be forced to restart these books. Please excuse my typos I think you will understand because the only thing off in the books were many typos but it was wotrh it.

The writing is stilted and I questioned \\"This is a 'best seller'?\\". Have people EVER read a REALLY good book? This is NOT one of those books. Thank you for all the people who have posted HONEST reviews. *Rolling my eyes - yeah, I took that from the reviews!* This moronic piece of 'literary' idiocy will become a movie..and people will go and watch it and perpetuate this madness!!!!Unbelievable.
B005DOJ68K|3.0|This is a solid collection. CCR has certainly made some timeless, classic tunes that will endure. I wouldn't put them up there with the Stones and the Beatles, as some other reviewers have, for two reasons. First is originality; their mix of rock and blues is fairly predictable. Second is the size of their catalogue, considerably smaller than the two others herein named.<br /><br />While I appreciate the quality of the music on this collection, it is the production that would cause me NOT to purchase this album again. Allow me to elaborate. The tracks overlap. That is, you get about 2 seconds of the next track at the end of the track title you are listening to. This in not convenient for any purpose. If you are listening to the album straight through, you get what appears to be a skip at the beginning of each track, where your player is actually simply moving along as normal. If you are listening to your library on random play, you, awkwardly, get 2 seconds of a song you are not about to hear after the previous CCR song ends, and before your player jumps to the next track.<br /><br />Given another chance, I would try another CCR compilation; there are several.

You will be sweating, grunting, and dam near dying unless you are in top physical shape and even Jillian's super healthy \\"helpers\\" struggled at times. I really love it and I've been consistent and so far I've seen some real results. For example I'm up to twenty(quality)push-ups without stopping when I started at about eight. I can go through about half of the workout now without stopping or being completely winded. I haven't noticed a ton of change in my physical appearance but I've got a lot of weight to lose so I'm not sweating that too much right now. My clothes are without a doubt looser so I know I've lost inches.<br /><br />I'm not giving this video five stars only because I find the warm-ups and cool downs to short and not very effective. I warm up on my own and with Jillian and I cool down with Jillian and I head straight into my yoga routine. I've felt sore in some spots but if your waking up the next day aching (like it hurts to move and your in serious pain) your either pushing to hard or you need to add your own warm-up and cool-down. Also, this video series is incredibly hard on the knee's so when we are doing serious impact moves I stick with the beginner because IT'S SAFER. I'm still getting a work out but I'm protecting my knees and I feel no shame! I've been doing the video everyday but I alternate between one and two so I'm not working the same muscle groups day after day. I don't do the video's on the weekend but I workout in other ways.<br /><br />If your doing this workout but your not reining your eating habits you will not see results. You've got to lower your calorie intake and cut out the fast-food, sweets, and really watch your portion control even with \\"good\\" foods. It won't matter if your eating \\"right\\" if your still taking in more calories than you burn!

B007MDQW3W|2.0|I've bought every record of Regina Spektor thus far and I usually burn the disc out by replaying and replaying till every line is stuck in my head. That just didn't happen this time. There were maybe one or two songs I liked but I didn't feel the same urge to replay the album.
B004W7C5N2|5.0|\\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" fascinated me and gave me chills every step of the way! This is a brilliant film that deserves its place on the short list of just about any fan of horror films and especially early silent-era horror films. Some people even consider this to be the first true horror film; not a single earlier shocking film could match this one! The acting is flawless in every respect; the use of make-up reflects great forethought. The use of color tinted film, the English intertitles with the original artwork and the musical score help set the atmospheric tone for the film as the movie employs both realist and stylized expressionist techniques and settings. The sets, some of which were primarily made of paper, have nightmarish, slanted and distorted views of streets and more to frighten the audience and suggest madness.<br /><br />We first see two men talking in a courtyard one night; one of them, Francis (Friedrich Feher), tells a shocking tale to the other. Francis speaks of an elderly man, Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss), who wandered into the town of Holstenwall where a fair was about to begin. We see Caligari get a permit for his \\"exhibit,\\" a somnambulist named Cesare who responds to his commands--and the questions of others when they ask him their future. While Caligari gets his permit, the town clerk, in a very bad mood, gives him a hard time and Caligari doesn't like that one bit.<br /><br />Meanwhile, two friends Francis and Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski) go to the town fair for amusement. But things change quickly; indeed, the rest of their day is anything but fun. Francis and Alan attend Dr. Caligari's exhibition of Cesare the somnambulist; but Alan becomes quite fearful when Cesare predicts that Alan will only live until the dawn of the very next day! Moreover, Alan and Francis are both in love with the beautiful Jane Olsen (Lil Dagover); they agree to let Jane decide which of them she will marry but each one fears a bitter disappointment if she chooses the other.<br /><br />Tragedy comes as things quickly go from bad to worse. First the town clerk is found dead; and then the next day Alan is found dead just as Cesare predicted! Francis suspects that Cesare might have committed the murders although he has no real evidence to go on. A third murder almost takes place although this time a man is apprehended before he can commit the crime--and all of them, including the police, must wonder if this man, Cesare--or perhaps even someone else--is perpetrating and attempting these terrible crimes.<br /><br />Naturally, there's much, much more than this to the plot; but I will leave out the rest so as not to spoil it for you! You'll be glued to the screen as you watch this amazing film. Pay close attention to the ending which has a most shocking, completely unexpected finale.<br /><br />\\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" will appeal to anyone interested in well done, classic horror films especially if they are from the silent movie era. The use of both realist and stylized expressionist techniques and settings along with a wealth of creativity make this picture a remarkable work of art as well.f she chooses the other.<br /><br />Tragedy comes as things quickly go from bad to worse.

B0051UH6W4|5.0|A mesmerising, poignant piece of poetic prose.<br /><br />The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy has left me smiling after I have closed the last page. The Booker Prize of 1997, Roy's debut novel drew controversy over morality due to its social commentary on religion (Syrian Christianity), the Caste system, Marxist Communism and sexuality in a post-colonial Kerala, Ayemenem, South Indian state.<br /><br />The story is a non-linear one with flashbacks in 1969 mostly in the eyes of 7 year old fraternal twins Estha and Rahel (brother and sister) who are reunited after 23 years after the death of their English cousin Sophie Mol.<br />The reader is led through detailed backstory and characters who adhere to the reader's mind because of the beautiful prose and play with the English language. Often the naivety of the children is witty and the tragedy comes from their naivety being shattered in the culmination of the events leading to Sophie Mol's death, the demise of their mother Ammu and their Untouchable friend Velutha.<br /><br />The children's grand-aunt Baby Kochamma is the key to the tragedy. An individual who is a schemer due to her own ideas of morality and besotted love for a Catholic Priest.<br /><br />While the plot is non-linear, often jumping from the present to flashbacks from the viewpoint of the children and sometimes from the viewpoint of the adults, they all intertwine into a finale that leaves the reader with a gratifying reflective understanding of the events in the story as a whole. The ending left me smiling despite the tragedy.<br /><br />However, there were moments of detailed prose and description of characters that sometimes seemed like tangents, making the reader impatient to find out the reason for Sophie Mol's death and how it happened. For example, the lever crossing man's appearance took at least a page. Was this necessary? In the context, probably since the reader is forced to realise the social injustices in society. Yet the detailed descriptions are there for a reason and I delighted in the prose itself.<br /><br />If you love how the English language can be manipulated in a poetic sense and are not intimidated by literary works, I strongly recommend this book for its mesmerising poignancy.
034580404X|5.0|Love this story! The sex gets a little boring but its easy to skim through.. other than that I loved the story and I wish there were more to read.
0312576463|5.0|This was my first Franzen novel and i had resisted this one in particular because of the weak user reviews. This book is perfect for anyone who has been in a long term relationship ie has necessarily been involved with personal messiness. Freedom not always comfortable but i found the character portrayals moving and believable. the story moves right along though of course there are frequent flashbacks. i thought the diary for the psychiatrist construct was terrific. my husband read it and also thought it was a great read. excellent ending.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i like it i mean love it....u do still get ads and stuff and its not that hard to undersand....u have to think about it its a free app
B007QNRMUU|5.0|Jason Mraz is an amazing lyricist and this isn't exactly like the rest of his albums.  More of a focus on \\"love songs\\" but still as enjoyable as any of the music he has ever written.  Definitely add this to your collection.
B006RUJST6|2.0|The story line was ok, but this book is so poorly written that I struggled to get through it.  It is full of grammatical errors that repeat themselves again and again.  I bought this book at the recommendation of someone I know and also based on all the 5-star reviews, which I truly don't understand.  Do yourself a favor and find something of higher quality to read.<br /><br />I'm ashamed to say that I also bought the sequel, hoping it would be better.  It was worse.  Don't waste your money.
B000001FN9|5.0|One of my favorite metal albums ever from one of my favorite bands ever. \\"Walking on the Edge\\", \\"Rhythm of Love\\", and many more are included on this album. A must have for 80's metal fans!
0440246008|5.0|As all of Lee Child's previous novels involving Jack Reacher, this one keeps your attention all the way through.  Unlike some action/mysteries, Lee Child is not predictable and it's hard to tell what is coming next.  Just enough sex and violence to satisfy most readers.  He is one of my favorites.
B000003B6K|5.0|Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, Easy E. DO I HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING MORE. THE BEST RAP GROUP EVER. PERIOD. NO QUESTIONS ASKED. Lyrics I cannot type into the review says \\"parental guidance suggested\\" is an UNDERSTATEMENT. The POLICE HATE THIS ALBUM.
B007Z9QS5K|4.0|It was a cute feel good movie with a nice ensemble cast.  It delivered on expectations, but it was a bit predictable.  I figured out who was going to cross paths with who, but overall nice movie.
B000001FN2|5.0|This album CLEARLY had the Devil's Choir(howling timber wolves) in mind. Their are actual wolves howling on the album! Doro Pesch is the best female metal vocalist possibly ever with only Lita Ford coming close. VERY \\"spooky\\" sounding album with lyrics like \\"I am the kiss of death\\" and \\"I rule the ruins\\". You can tell this had the German occult scene in mind when recorded. Although certainly not death metal, this still is a very witchcraft like metal much like Helloween or Ozzy.
B002FU42NE|4.0|You know those times when you're all back from the dead and gothed up and should be rarin' to go take out a gang of thugs that threw you out a window, but you just can't seem to tear yourself off the couch? Those times when you know you should be out scaring the crap out of murderers and rapists before popping their heads off like champagne corks but you just want to wrack up one more star in Angry Birds? This album will motivate even the most lethargic Praxidice to stop streaming Lost and kick the crap out of some eye-ball smoking weirdos.
B000PD8SM4|5.0|One of the best metal bands ever! \\"Is This Love\\" is one of the best metal love songs ever made and is included on this album. \\"Still of the Night\\", \\"Here I Go Again,\\", and many more are included as well. A must have for 80's metal fans!
B008EQIK90|3.0|I have no idea why hollywood thinks that if it add a ton of foul language, that would make the movie funny. It didn't need the foul language, at least not after every two words to be funny. After a while that's all you focus on unless you are also a potty mouth. Please hollywood, let's put out movies that the whole family can watch. We don't mind being realistic, but not over the top with the street language.
B0087OSP0S|5.0|Some stories weave a single thread, or if you're fortunate, perhaps three or four, but not the story of Tempus, and the heroes of his Sacred Band. Its threads are countless and it's weave, subtle and imperceptible, holding a pattern beyond time itself.<br />I am having so much fun reading them out of order.<br />And it speaks to the Author's craft that I can.<br />It's her voice that lends intimacy to the characters that inhabit her thieves' world, like a whisper in the dark.<br />So far, I've read Mage Blood, Beyond Sanctuary, The Sacred band, and Wake of the Riddler.<br />But that's been my journey there.<br />If you're looking for the one that can pull you in first,<br />Wake of the Riddler can.

B000002JNN|5.0|I must say the sound is so much better on this than BUYV. It's also a better album overall. It's heavier. Though there are a few that i just never cared for.<br /><br />Thunderstruck 5/5 - Ok everyone knows this one, but it still pumps me up. It's about the guys hitting the town and having a great time, with women of course, not sure if this is a sex song or not, I'm gonna guess partially.<br /><br />Fire Your Guns 4/5 - Another fast track by them, another sex song.<br /><br />Moneytalks 100/5 - BEST SONG ON HERE! Why this isn't on their setlist anymore I'll never know. This song just does something to me, it just makes me want to get up and lift a car. The chorus is definetely one of their best. It's about a man whos trying to impress a woman by buying her anything she wants.<br /><br />The Razor's Edge 5/5 - Great, creepy song. The intro is badass. I think this is about war.<br /><br />Mistress For Christmas 2/5 - Now this song i never exactly cared for. I think it's kind of like Big Balls, more of a joke than a song. IT just never has a steady pace. It's about a man who wants a prostitute for christmas, another sex song.<br /><br />Rock Your Heart Out 4/5 - Great riff and chorus. The title says it all, thats what its about.<br /><br />Are You Ready 5/5 - Great song with great intro adn chorus. Another sex song.<br /><br />Got You By the Balls 4/5 - This is decent, the riff is the best here. I think it's about a man hiring a prostitute. Another sex song.<br /><br />Shot of Love 5/5 - Pretty badass riff. Another sex song.<br /><br />Lets Make It 5/5 - I love this chorus! Another sex song.<br /><br />Goodbye and Good Riddance to Bad Luck 3/5 - This is decent but it seems more like filler. It's about a man who's bad luck takes a turn.<br /><br />If You Dare 3/5 - This is ok, the best on here is the bass guitar. It's too short. Another sex song.<br /><br />All in all a very good album, the very good songs overpower the less good ones so don't worry.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very awesome! Even Guano enjoys playing it after a long boring day at the studios. Its very fun and creative so anyone will love it
B00008WT5J|3.0|If it wasn't for the song Who Made Who, this would have been terrible but that song saves this from being a crappy cd. LOVE WHO MADE WHO. MY second fav AC/DC song, first being Shake Your Foundations. I'm only going to review the three songs on here that don't appear on their other cds.<br /><br />Who Made Who 100/5 - LOVE THIS SONG! Awesome! It's about how electronics are controlling people instead of people controlling electronics. This song was ahead of its time.<br /><br />D.T. 4/5 - An instrumental by them thats pretty good.<br /><br />Chase the Ace 3/5 - Another instrumental thats decent but gets repetitive.<br /><br />All in all not bad but just get it if your a casual fan or if you have a weakness for Who MAde Who like me.
B004OR199G|5.0|Inspiring, a great read, good information. Also receive newsletter now and perished web site which has a lot of information.
B00009MGR6|5.0|Yes, Brian's voice echoes a little, and yes it's not as heavy as their previous work, but come one, it's still pretty damn good to me. This was the last album that Brian Johnson co-wrote songs for, which explains why some of their lyrics after this kinda slack.<br /><br />Heatseeker 5/5 - Best song off this one. Love the chorus. This was released as a single and it's about a man using protection for sex and making sure everythings clean. another sex song.<br /><br />That's the Way I Wanna Rock n' Roll 5/5 - Kind of an old school song by them, really good chorus. It's pretty much about just pure rock and roll.<br /><br />Meanstreak 5/5 - Love this riff, it's about a guy with a meanstreak.<br /><br />Go Zone 5/5 - Like the guitar over the chorus and the solo. Another sex song.<br /><br />Kissin' Dynamite 5/5 - I LOVE THE RIFF! It's another sex song, probably s and m.<br /><br />Nick of Time 5/5 - I love this chorus, the intro really gets this song going also. It's about a fugitive running from the law.<br /><br />Some Sin' For Nuthin' 5/5 - Love the riff and SOLO. MY GOD I LOVE THAT SOLO! It's about how people sin over stupid things such as killing innocent people.<br /><br />Ruff Stuff 5/5 - Absolutely one of the best on here, another sex song.<br /><br />Two's Up 5/5 - Great, just great, intro is awesome. It's about a man in a threesome, another sex song.<br /><br />This Means War 4/5 - Pretty fast song by them, the riff kind of reminds me of thunderstruck. It's about war, obviously.

I enjoy reading a  book that I can really get into and can't wait to turn the page, when I wasn't reading it I was wondering what was going to happen next. GREAT FIRST BOOK CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.
B007SGM084|2.0|Bought the triology so I could read the entire set/thought it would be a quick summer beach read.  There was so much hype about it that I was curious.  The truth is this book is not only poorly written (very repetitive to say the least about it) but it is also thoroughly sick.  I am almost finished with the second book/not a quick read at all because truth be told it is not that interesting.  Skip over and skim quite a bit just to get through with it.  If I had not bought all three books, I would not feel so compelled to finish it.  This book would make excellent reading for a psychotherapist though!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book flows great and has many surprises, which helps to keep the suspense in check.  Neither character is likable, but as you read you'll see that they're not supposed to be.  I personally don't care for a book that has a less than satisfying ending because it makes me feel as though there should be more, and/or that just possibly, I've wasted precious time investing in a lesson not learned in the end.
0307744434|5.0|I'm usually not much for fantasy stories, but this was one of the best books I've read in a long time. As soon as I finished it, I wanted to read it again. It was well-written, well edited (important to me), and the author's imagination continued to stun me from page to page. I know I will read it over and over.

B0086QS7N2|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since my teens, but it's been a fair number of years since I've listened to them. I think \\"Counterparts\\" was the last album I got before picking up \\"Clockwork Angels.\\" I didn't care for \\"Counterparts\\" so much and I was concerned they were losing their touch a bit. But whatever reservations I had were erased with \\"Clockwork Angels.\\" I feel like a teenager again! It is so nice to be able to recognize your favorite band after so many years. So many things have changed, but Rush is still Rush and you can count on them to stay that way and that makes me so very happy. I love the addition of the strings and piano - it's a very nice touch that really rounds out the sound. \\"The Garden\\" is my favorite song on this album. I also like that you can find a gem of a song anywhere on the album, and not just get the \\"best\\" ones right off the top. This tells me that they haven't lost their integrity and I hope they never do.

B005J4TLN4|2.0|The acting, directing, and special effects weren't bad at all. But that doesn't make a story. The script is partly a rip off elements of better movies, and partly just not well crafted.<br />The main characters start out the movie by mugging a local girl. Just because they are bored kids. Now, in the hands of Stanly Kubrick, this could turn into an awesome movie. But, unfortunately, it doesn't. That is supposed to be largely overlooked, as they become \\"heroes\\" just because they fight back against the alien invaders that are trying to kill them. Shallow, barely detailed alien invaders that look like a combination of Critters and something more werewolf like. Dragging the girl they mugged back into it, some of them get injured. Their drug dealer flips, goes off his rocker, and eventually starts just randomly shooting at everything. The posse of dimwitted ghetto girls they pick up at the last minute are full of cliches. At they first are upset, then start calling them heroes. All of this might work better if the movie was seriously shot, but it's run as a tongue in cheek comedy the whole time, and just doesn't work.

0060589280|3.0|Maria is a young woman that desperately wants to find love and be loved but has no idea how to make this a reality. As Maria enters womanhood, she learns life and love are full of risks and choices. She finds herself in precarious situations and satiates her curiosity while trying to find her true essence. As her journey continues she discovers and comes to term with her sexuality and has a better understanding of the woman she is and the woman she could be. Maria has held herself hostage for so long she has to break down the walls so she can find happiness and fight off loneliness her walls have caused her. You witness Maria's fears subside as she metamorphoses  into a woman that surrenders and embraces herself and all that life has to offer. Maria learns that life's foundation is based on risks and choices.<br /><br />This was an ok book. I feel for Coelho, tough to follow The Alchemist - in my opinion, everything seems to fail in comparison.<br /><br />Maria was more than a prostitute. The story was more than the sexual nature if you initially perused the pages. The book was really about self enlightenment and that life as a whole is about risks and choices.<br /><br />Add this to your TBR list and see what you discover after reading its entirety.

After years of going from program to program, from method to method, and finding bits and pieces of each that are repeated in various places having the same effect a large percentage of the time, finally, Mike has brought concepts (and truths) together in one well written and well articulated book. I have tried, and failed, over and over to lose weight. I am not tall but I am definitely very stout. I love to lift heavy and this book is like a beacon in the dark for me. I have just this week started in on my routine and my eating plan. I spent the last week using the book and its concepts to lay out my first 8 weeks (phase 1)of eating and workouts. Yup, I know, I feel the same way. Writing a review right now is not worth near as much as a review 1 year from now (with some installments along the way of course). So here is my promise to you, my fellow book buyers and seekers of a lean, muscular body.....not merely thin.....I am going to follow the concepts in this book for the initial time allotted. Mike lays out approximately 58 weeks of workouts. My menu is set and my macro-nutrients are approximately in the appropriate proportions and my calories are almost right on....a little short if anything (based on my BMR of course). I have also decided to update my BodySpace account on bodybuilding.com. The last time I was on there was in November of 2011 and not much seems to have changed for me since then. But now, I believe it will. If you wish, come follow my progress on bodybuilding.com......my username is mdgentry......request me as a friend if you wish....I'll see you there. If not, I will see you in about 58 weeks.....and maybe with a few installments between. Good luck to you on your quest for fitness!!!! May we see each other down the road with great stories of wonderful success to tell each other.<br /><br />PS  I have e-mailed mike on some of this material and he tries to get back to each and every e-mail as soon as he can.....HIMSELF!!!! Heck of a guy!!!al and he tries to get back to each and every e-mail as soon as he can.....HIMSELF!!!! Heck of a guy!!!
B004LWZWGA|4.0|The technical errors in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES are enough to warn viewers that they'll wish there were subtitles for some of the quiet scenes between Marion Cotillard and/or Anne Hathaway, both of whom have a habit of dropping their voices at key moments. Miss Cotillard has whole sentences that are key to an understanding of her character that are barely intelligible at a crucial plot point. Surely, whoever designed the audio mix has some explaining to do.<br /><br />Otherwise, fans will get their money's worth of action and thrills despite a lumbering plot that takes far too long to unwind after a breathtaking opening shot involving mid-air hostages.<br /><br />And the performances are uniformly fine from the large cast--Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Matthew Modine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine. But the flaws are there in the script which has too many strands of sub-plots to cover and too many humiliating fights between Bane and Batman before the man of steel redeems himself again.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are moments where it kicks into high gear between some dull stretches. Christopher Nolan sees to it that the action sequences are given top priority to any other values inherent in the script. All of the gadgets are as slick as ever.<br /><br />Personally, I still prefer the first and second \\"Batman\\" films to this one which is sometimes too muddled in content. Biggest drawback is the fact that the sound mix of voices vs. explosions (and Hans Zimmer's music) has been poorly handled at key moments in plot development.<br /><br />Fans of \\"Batman\\" will probably overlook the audio weaknesses in the long run, but I felt they should be pointed out, especially since so much expense was put into the visuals of this action epic.

I was having withdrawals from fifty shades of grey and just looking for someone to fill the void of Christian Grey and I will tell you Travis did it in a different way. He isnt rich he isnt a dom but I think I have fallen for yet another book character just the same.

0547564651|4.0|Overall, I give the book 3.5 stars, but am rounding up out of respect for the likely countless hours of research and fact-finding to present all of this information in one consolidated book.  That alone gives a lot of credibility to the book, but also takes away from the flow.  I'll explain that in more detail later.<br /><br />Who should buy this? What's the TARGET AUDIENCE?<br />================================================<br />I wish these questions were answered in every Book's Product Description as part of an Amazon Template.<br /><br />We are first-time parents with a 6-month old and I was pretty excited to get this book.  It talks about potentially changing how we raise our children, how good school systems should be run and shaping and weaving your child's social fabric.  Instead, I found it to be a very technical book with a ton of research on what has happened in the past with little followup/advice on what we can \\"Go Do\\".  This is not a practical parenting guide, rather, a history of child development in the past with no magic answers.<br /><br />If you are looking to read a book to ensure you are doing the right things or using some creative KIPP school teachings, etc, with \\"turnaround stories\\" and fairy tale endings, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />If you were a history major and appreciate child development psychology and behavior patterns from diverse cultures, then yes, this would be a very intriguing and worthwhile book.<br /><br />What I think the THEME of the book is:<br />==========================================<br />The book starts off exactly the way I was hoping the entire theme of the book would be.  It has a comparison/contrast between a privileged child (Nadine Burke Harris) and a not-so privileged child (Elizabeth Dozier) who both ended up having successful careers helping others.  I kept hoping for the \\"Big Reveal\\" on how Dozier overcame adversity growing up in a harsh Chicago neighborhood with a single mom, but instead itfast forwards to her new job assignment at one of the most dangerous high schools in the state, Fenger High School.  Okay fine, then I was hoping to read about how Dozier turned around that high school, \\"Lean on Me - the Movie\\" style, but slightly frustratingly, her story mostly stops there.  (Ultimately, by the end of the book, it seems like her high school \\"turnaround\\" was kicking a few kids out of the school, which isn't the encouraging, warm-fuzzy, positive thing.  It talks about taking the most special care and attention for the school's roughest kid, Mush, who improves, then, one night goes back to his old ways and ends up in jail, I guess not everything will be a fairy tale ending.)<br /><br />The rest of the stories in the book reinforce how \\"ACE\\" scores (Adverse Childhood Experience index) and the higher number of adverse childhood experiences you've had will ultimately affect your ability to succeed, regardless of the best schools that you attend.  For example, a group of poverty and privilege-stricken students were sent through a KIPP scholastic program, where they definitely improved, but like Mush, 80% of them still did not graduate college.  There's a story about how one of the top scholars in the program later lost the intensity and dropped out of college and became a cable-guy; I keep hoping to read some rags to riches stories, but sometimes the ACE index is so high, it just doesn't happen.<br /><br />So unfortunately the THEME of the book seemed to be, your ACE score and your ability to handle stress predicts how successful you will be.  Since you can't change past adverse childhood experiences, the book at least doesn't provide guidance on what to do about what you can't change, so seemingly, these kids are mostly stuck.  That's not the story I wanted to read.<br /><br />Other feedback on this book:<br />=============================<br />There's a chapter about how to think and create a genius, that I thought was going to be my rags to riches story, but unfortunately, it leaves me with mixed emotions.  There's a school called Intermediate School 318 (IS-318) that mostly poverty/privilege stricken students attended (ie. 87% qualified for federal lunch subsidies), yet they were beating some of the best private schools in the nation in Chess.<br /><br />It discusses the transparent teaching styles of the Chess teacher, Elizabeth Spiegel.  This was probably the more fascinating chapters as it discusses how several children from the projects, would beat some of the highest ranked Chess Grandmasters in the World.  It also talks about a psychologist named Polgar who stated he could turn his kids into Chess geniuses and that he did.  They were some of the highest ranked persons (though children) in the world.  There's also a story about the Kamsky family who practiced chess some 15 hours a day, no tv, no sports, etc and they too became some of the highest ranked in the world.  Sure, some of the best chess players in the world, but at what price??<br /><br />Then there's the let-down towards the end of that chapter.  One of students from IS-318 who beat the highly ranked Chess grandmaster, went through the same teachings for an Admissions Test, by the same Chess teacher, Ms. Spiegel.  She focused on him and gave him all the same attention and care and teaching style that led him to be one of the top ranked Chess players in the world.  Yet, perhaps it was his ACE score, he couldn't locate Africa or Asia on a map!  This was such a let-down, because perhaps her transparent Chess teaching style or perhaps the psychologist Polgar's methods were ground-breaking that they could transform any kid from any background, yet, unfortunately, the chapter proved it cannot.<br /><br />Later the book concludes with a longer case study on Kewauna Lerma, who is enrolled in a new OneGoal teaching program in Chicago.  Ultimately, she wasn't able to raise her ACT score high enough to get into the college of her choice in 2011, but was able to get accepted into a college.  Still not completely rags to riches, but it is great that she had the grit and perseverance and good character to stay focused.  [I just did an Internet search and looks like she made Western Illinois' Dean's List for her freshman year! Great job!]<br /><br />Suggestions/Improvements for the Advanced Proof Copy that I read:<br />=========================<br />There is so much research and case studies and references in this book, that it really takes away from the basic flow of the book.  The author would have been better off using footnotes, than introducing the background of every educator, scientist, psychologist, economist, researcher, medical journal, periodical and case study and making the information too complex.  I feel that the author was so concerned about giving credit where credit is due, that it gets overdone and it's hard to read and follow the book.  Just keep it simple.  Give credit with footnotes.  Talk about the stories that inspire us.  Not everything will have a fairy tale ending, but provide us closure with characters you introduce.  Focus on the kids, not the background of the guy with the PHD who researched something for 12 years.  We'll take your word for it, if we are curious, we'll read the footnote and follow-up that way.<br /><br />Accurately define what the Target Audience is on the backcover so readers won't feel disappointed later.  For every sentence on the back cover summary, a third party reader should be able to answer those questions and point them out from content in the book.<br /><br />Lastly, I question the inclusion of the How to Think chapter (though I found it the most fascinating), apparently you can teach privilege stricken kids how to think and play Chess, but it won't help the child succeed in school or life, especially with the examples of children playing chess 10-15 hours a day in lieu of playing sports or other social activity.<br /><br />Overall, I applaud the amount of researchdone to produce this book, but readers that are parents (the most likely Target Audience) want a simple message and we'll take your word for it. :-)
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I have heard about this book for years...I had seen the movie without ever reading the book.<br /><br />Take the time out of your life to read this novel.  \\"Time\\" listed it as one of the top 100 novels of all time...and I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />Characters are deep and you find yourself bouncing from liking to hatred to respect to sadness for each of the characters.  That is a feat not easily accomplished--as witnessed by most novels I have read.<br /><br />The novel is also a success from a plot standpoint as well...especially for those of you who remember the 80's and the potentiality of nuclear war on a global scale.<br /><br />Can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />This may not be the most flowery or deep review...sorry I don't have the gift of the written word.  Just trust me on this one.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|I gave the first season DVD of \\"Sherlock\\" only four stars, because of the weak third episode, which was actually filmed first. As the documentary on Disk 2 says, this season takes on the three biggest Holmes stories, involving Irene Adler, the hound of the Baskervilles, and Sherlock's supposed end and the death of James Moriarity. The first two episodes are brilliant, better than anything in the first season. The third episode, the Reichenbach Fall, is positively out of this world, over the top magnificent.<br /><br />As I was watching it, it occurred to me how much easier it is to write about a character with superhuman, or seemingly superhuman characteristics, such as Jason Bourne, Gandalf the Grey, Jedi knights, and every comic book superhero you can name. You can have them do virtually anything you want, in any given situation. If you need lots of different skills, you create teams like the Fantastic Four or the X-Men or the Avengers. Their roles are one extended deux ex machina. The thing which turns these stories into comic books is that you then must create villains with superhuman powers to make it a fair fight. It also helps if you throw in a secret vulnerability or two such as Kryptonite. The original Sherlock Holmes character is so durable because while his powers appear almost magical, they are never outside the realm of acute human observation and ratiocination, although I think that if a person trained themselves in Holmes' methods, their success rate would be nowhere near Holmes's 96% accuracy. This may also be why Gandalf is such a successful character. You can count on one hand how often he uses overt magic between both \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"LOTR\\".<br /><br />And, in these three episodes, we get a huge helping of the four most freakishly superhuman characters in the Holmes corpus. Aside from Holmes, we get lots of Mycroft Holmes (far more than in the stories), James Moriarty, the \\"consulting criminal\\" and Irene Adler, whose persona is built up quite a bit from her appearance in only one original story, \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\".<br /><br />Just as I was marvelling over my observation about superhuman characters, in episode 3, the writers turn it all around on Sherlock (something which never happens in the stories) and he is, as Lestrade's female sargeant describes him, freakish. His success is in coming to correct conclusions from thin evidence is thought to be too good to be true, and he is indicted for perpetrating a crime he just solved.<br /><br />Here I get into dangerous waters, risking giving too much away. I can only suggest that the richness and cleverness with which these stories are displayed on the screen is far more engaging than anything I, or Arthur Conan Doyle, for that matter, could have put on paper.<br /><br />Possibly the greatest treat is the interaction between Holmes and Moriarty, which virtually never happens in the stories. One of the most marvelous things about Holmes, Mycroft, and Moriarty is that they defy all the usual trademarks ascribed to them by Doyle, they fit into the 21st century perfectly, with no trace of a mannerism saying \\"look how clever I am in transplanting these characters\\", and yet they are totally true to the soul of the characters created by Doyle. Mycroft and Moriarity are both youngish and thin. Sherlock literally mocks several of the usual trademarks such as his deerstalker cap. Best of all, Moriarty is depicted as quite literally bordering on a kind of brilliant insanity. Moriarty, in the opening scene, done, I believe, to a track of music from Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (it may be \\"The Thieving Magpie Overture) is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />The other two episodes are similarly brilliantly executed, with a few twists you won't find in Doyle's stories. I am almost inclined to suggest you be sure to get Season 1 before getting Season 2, so the second does not spoil the experience of the first, with is first rate, but a bit messy in the end.it from her appearance in only one original story, \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\".<br /><br />Just as I was marvelling over my observation about superhuman characters, in episode 3, the writers turn it all around on Sherlock (something which never happens in the stories) and he is, as Lestrade's female sargeant describes him, freakish.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I must say that I truly did enjoy reading the Fifty Shades series. If you like a love story, which I do, then these are the books for you. I am an advid reader of Brenda Jackson and she loves love, and this fell right in line. E L James did a good job with making you fall in love with these characters.
0553386794|1.0|I picked up a copy of A Game of Thrones when it was first published several years ago.  I was excited to start a new fantasy series and was interested in the strong political bent this series promised.  The story starts well, the Starks are an interesting family, the world they live in is complex and layered, the ominous wall to the North is a cool concept, and somewhere around page 100 I stopped caring.<br />Flash forward to several months ago, A Game of Thrones the TV show was the new hotness and droves of people were reading the books and crowing the series praises.  I decided to give the book a second chance... 150-200 pages later and I gave up.  I don't know why I can't finish this book.  On paper it's got everything that makes a good fantasy series, warring nations, political intrigue, coming of age stories, scary-other-worldly threats from the unknown, dragons... but maybe that's the problem, it's got too much of everything.  The scope is to wide for me, there are too many characters doing big important things.  I like big stories with a small cast of characters, it's just easier for me to digest. To sum it all up - not my cup of tea.

There are different activities he can think out for those characters, which enhances the fun. In short, this set is great, and we look forward to another set of the same theme this Christmas!
1575666286|5.0|I stumbled upon a documentary called The Gerson Miracle, which peaked my interest enough to want this book.  This is GREAT information to have before you or a family member get a diagnosis of cancer.  It gives an alternative to chemo, which usually doesn't work for most cancers.  It also gave me hope that cancer can be beat by getting your body in the healthy condition required to fight it.  And, who doesn't want to be healthy anyway?? ;)
1612130283|5.0|A literary masterpiece set to be a historical classic?? No, but it wasn't intended to be. Yes, parts of the book are repetitive, but so what. I found all 3 books an easy and enjoyable to read. The books provided a nice escape into another type of life, which based upon the popularity of these books, I would say many woman are intrigued by. Go forth, read and enjoy.

0345803493|1.0|I guess I must be masochist for reading this second part of the trilogy after being disappointed with the first one. The only difference is, that there is, thank god, less holy crap's, holy cow's and jeez's in this book. The plot is going nowhere, all the characthers have no depth. Anastasia still thinks and feels like a teenager. I am especially irritated by her jealousy about his past, pages after pages he is tormenting him with the questions. All other men and women are described as threats to their relationship, which is so infantile. I can't honestly believe this was written by a married woman in her 40's, because it feels more like written by some teenager with no experience in life. I am worried about the thoughts this would provoke in the heads of young readers, because this book has nothing to do with real life. There are stories like this in the Internet and there this one should have stayed too, don't understand how this ever got published and praised. Maybe there is a big audience that don't read at all and if this is their first book they think this is literature?!<br /><br />Everything happens so fast and is SO predictable. Married after knowing eachother for what, two months or less? And of course her best friends marries Christian's brother and together they can drink champagne and drive Audi's. Boring.

B0000025BL|5.0|Bat Out of Hell was the rock band Meat Loaf's first successful album. It was new and raw and a little suggestive. The music was hot and driven. Meat Loaf himself wailed and whispered and begged with his unique voice and America fell in love. On the top of the charts ever since it came out, I played my tape endlessly until it was as beat up as Meat Loaf's bike. I got a new CD and am playing it often. I'm glad Amazon offers it.

It was generally thought there could never be another rock album as good and with the longevity of interest as BOH 1, but BOH 2 really delivers. \\"I would do anything for love...\\" is marvelous. Thanks, Amazon, for offering this follow-up CD.

0810989956|2.0|I can say two positive things this book is that it gives kids a chance to interact with a book. They can write their own responses or draw pictures for questions and prompts in the book. I think it will be fun for my son to look back years later at what he thought as a six-year-old.<br /><br />The other positive comment I can make about the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is that it gets my son engaged in reading. He can't put these books down. The handwritten style of text combined with the line art make these books very attractive to young children.<br /><br />As a parent, I'm not crazy about the books. I think they are a crass. They highlight the negative aspects of middle school and they show unkind relationships between family members. My son is only six. I think he is too young to be reading about the bullying and ackward growth years of pre-adolesence.

1401223176|4.0|Batman: Hush feels like an awesome introduction to the world of Batman.  I say this because it covers many of the facets that make up Batman as a character.  The story doesn't portray Bruce as the seemingly invincible character Batman has seemingly grown to be in popular culture.  He gets severely injured a couple times in the story, and this hinders him.  Instead, the plot has Bruce doing what he does best, which is being the world's greatest detective.  At its core, the plot is a traditional detective story that takes Bruce across the globe and through his past.  In addition to giving you a deeper look not only into how Batman operates and how Bruce thinks, the investigatory nature of the plot brings him face to face with many of his biggest enemies and allies.  Poison Ivy, Croc, Ra's al Ghul, Harley Quinn, and even the Joker all make appearances, as well as Dick Grayson, Tim Drake, Barbara Gordon, Jim Gordon, Talia al Ghul, Superman, and Catwoman.  But not only does Batman: Hush introduce us to these characters, but for many of them, it introduces us to Batman's relationship with these characters.<br /><br />Bruce's interactions with Selina are phenomenally entertaining.  And while this odd on/off romance between the two is the highlight in terms of character interaction, there many other truly great moments to be experienced here, that give you insight into the dynamics behind many of Bruce's relationships, like the tense and slightly adversarial yet immensely friendly relationship he shares with Superman, and the guilt he continues to feel over the Joker's past deeds.<br /><br />Overall, Batman: Hush is a great ride, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to get into Batman comics.  It touches on a lot of different aspects of the Batman universe, but often only just long enough that you'll come out of this story with a good idea of where you want to go next.  If there is one thing that can be held against it however, it's the villain Hush.  The mastermind behind the mystery, Hush doesn't make his grand appearance until the last few pages of the book, and as a result the finale feels rushed.  Furthermore, Hush's motivations behind his acts aren't really explained.  Overall, he's not a good character, and it really sticks out in a book like this, filled with characters that have been fleshed out for decades.  In short, the story is a great ride, with a mediocre ending.ehind the mystery, Hush doesn't make his grand appearance until the last few pages of the book, and as a result the finale feels rushed.

0345803507|5.0|This trilogy is AMAZING! I'm not much of a reader but when I started this series I couldn't put it down. I will say though, that these books are definitely NOT for anyone under the age of 18. The first book is a little more racy compared to the last two.I read some reviews on the first book and some people said it was too racy and wasn't good. However, I enjoyed it but as you continue on to the other two books, the story-line gets really good and I would consider it to be more action packed. Overall, I truly loved reading all of the books and would love to read more by E.L.James.
B001MTENOC|4.0|Many years ago, I had read and enjoyed Brian Weiss [[ASIN:0671657860 Many Lives, Many Masters: The True Story of a Prominent Psychiatrist, His Young Patient, and the Past-Life Therapy That Changed Both Their Lives]]  and so I felt I had everything I needed to understand reincarnation. Yet,  Journey of Souls gave me a fresh perspective: a deep view to the inter-lives period which is so much more interesting than the earthly lives. This really caught my attention. It is entertaining and well-documented. A must read to understand and remember what the soul already knows.

I found the headset very uncomfortable with the square ear cups fitting very awkward. I do need to state that I wear glasses and that definately effects comfort. After wearing for about 30 minutes the ear pain where my glasses sat was unbearable. On the plus side the sound quality was excellent. If you wear glasses DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
B000SEI230|1.0|This story lacked passion. The ball was dropped big time and was very disappointed.  The movie is based off this story, but the movie writer made many changes that were not in the book... I think for good reason.  Watch the movie and pass on the book.
B00846REIS|5.0|Wow Amazing!!!  I have never read a romance/erotic book in my life.  I've always been a true crime reader.  However, after hearing all the hoopla about 50 Shades in the office, on TV and the radio I thought why not give it a shot.  I borrowed book 1 from a friend while someone else was reading book 2 etc.  I could not wait so I bought the triology and I'm so glad I did.  I've read it twice and every now and then find myself taking anohter peek!  After I raved at the office about the book someone suggested Bared to You.  I felt equally excited about this book as 50 Shades.  I was not aware until at the end of the book that there was a book 2 and that I would have to wait until October...(Hurry up October).  I'm hooked.  I bought a Kindle Fire and am always looking for similar books.  So far I've read about 5 and I'm sure there is plenty more where that came from.

B005CM9DX6|4.0|It took me a while to really love this album. I had been listening to Opeth since 2008 and got into them through their death metal stuff. I even liked Damnation and Watershed. But this album left me feeling cold the first time I heard it. Since then I would listen to this album at work, on the way to and from work, at home, on the go, etc. But it really took me a lot of listens to really get it. Most music, especially prog rock, needs to be really absorbed before you can really like it. Ame thing happened to me with The Mars Volta's 2012 \\"Noctourniquet\\".<br /><br />This is an album that really should be listened to on either a real sound system or a high quality pair of earphones. There are a lot of intricate melodies that can be overlooked easily if you're not paying attention. There's a lot of jazzy sounds and even songs you could imagine the members playing around a campfire. The sound mix is top notch too, and for Opeth even, isn't too loud- then again, Steven Wilson produced it. For one, I really love \\"I Feel The Dark\\" and how the vocal melody mimics the keyboard riff. The two instrumentals are fantastic too- Heritage being a beautiful piano piece and Marrow of the Earth being a lovely acoustic piece. There really are too many good tracks to name, really.<br /><br />In short, this album is really an album that has to be listened to front to back, while sitting down and concentrating on the music and beautiful melodies front and centre. Opeth really did a great job with how they started off as death metal, moved to prog death metal, then just to prog metal and just prog. Akerfeldt stated that the red roots on the album cover represent the band's death metal past and the bright and sunny land with the tree represents where the band have always wanted to be, in a progressive rock wonderland almost. No surprises there, as this is really the sound of a band completely finding its footing and moving forward in a fluid pattern.<br /><br />A must buy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Hesitated before reading the book after hearing some reviews. My view was different than what I had heard. The book series is quite descriptive in it's erotic scenes but I saw the phsychology aspects as well as the emotional, \\"Cinderella meets her Prince\\" type story. I think most young girls dream of meeting and connecting with \\"the man of their dreams\\" and the \\"happily ever after\\". Great story with deep intense emotional connections.
B001223BLU|5.0|After seeing \\"Jersey Boys\\" live, I couldn't get the music out of my mind.  Searched on Amazon.  This album has it all. Takes me back in time.

B007UW9WOQ|5.0|If you love sushi, prepare to eat sushi right after watching this because you're craving for it will be undeniable. And then prepare to be disappointed that it's not Jiro's.<br /><br />In documenting Jiro's life, we get a clear glimpse of a master, and perhaps of Japanese culture as a whole. The work ethic and singular preoccupation for the perfection of a trade is more than rare, and the amount of dedication of every member in the family and business is stunning. Beautiful camera angles, shots, montages, and hi-def slow motion make you watch in awe of the beauty of even mundane things like Jiro tying his apron or the placement of sushi on a plate. Well timed and with just broad enough scope of subject matter, the film doesn't shy away from being a full reflection of Jiro's life - good and bad. His parents abandoned him and, likewise, he was barely a father to his sons. You can take it as a lesson about the price of perfection, but since this isn't a story about life as a whole, the focus remains squarely on being a celebration of a rare and hard-won art.<br /><br />Full warning to the squeamish: I believe that if you have moral qualms about meat-eating, then you should most likely not be watching a film that documents and is a tribute to a top expert in meat-preparation. It will upset you, regardless of its production because it's about the content of one man's life. The film is what it intended and markets itself to be, so don't criticize the fact that it's Jiro's story and not your own. He's dedicated his life to being the best at killing live seafood and preparing it for consumption. Fish do die in this film, and viewers should know that this is what they've decided to watch. (To reviewers who mention specifics: I'm surprised that the octopus \\"suffocation\\" was the offensive part and not the live fish having its body sliced off as its head was nailed to the cutting board...)<br /><br />I was personally satisfied by their section on the scarcity of ocean resourcesand their plea for the enforcement of sustainable fishing practices. A movie celebrating sushi would be remiss if they left this out. One thing that was brought to my attention is that the sudden popularity and cheap availability of sushi across the world is a large component of over-fishing.  Any longer on this topic though, and I feel like the attention would've been diverted from the main point of the film - which is Jiro and his relentless journey towards sushi perfection.<br /><br />Jiro Dreams of Sushi is beautifully made with an interesting subject. Given the popularity of sushi these days (from cities to suburban malls), it should be a good watch for many, but also raise awareness of what good sushi is and a subtle reminder that, as always, cheap food has a hidden price.

0307730697|4.0|Fearless is a great introduction to the life of a true hero.  Heroes are not made in the event in which they gave their lives; they are made in many different choices throughout their lives.  Such is true of Adam Brown.  His background as a young boy and in the early part of becoming a man did not indicate his heroism.  We learn through his life that second chances are always available, and that no one event can define a person's destiny.<br /><br />Eric Blehm gives a face and a name to the spirit of the Navy Seals.  We learn about his personality, his family life, his education, his childhood antics, his mistakes, his marriage, his determination -- all of these factors added up to the person he became.  Our country benefited from who he was, as he lived to give the ultimate sacrifice for the rest of us.<br /><br />The book inspires us, since it focuses on the whole man that Adam Brown became.  It does not focus on individual events, but on him.  We become personally connected to him through reading about his life and the people whom he loved.  Often Seals are mysterious, and anonymous, and therefore it is difficult for us to connect with them on a personal level.  But in this book, through the story of Adam Brown, we do.  And we are better for it.<br /><br />This is more than just a biography of a great man.  It is tremendous encouragement for everyone who has met someone on the road to being a hero.  We could each be part of that process for those around us.  The people in Adam's life certainly were that for him.<br /><br />This is a feel-good book, not because it has a happy ending, but because there are great people in the world, and we get to spend time with one of them named Adam Brown!<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book from WaterBrook Press in exchange for an honest review.
B007H9B6KA|4.0|The band remains in tact; experimental, timeless and retro as ever. Ninetys nostalgia and classic synthy electronic vibes are cemented and engraved in their work. The band proves immortality in every sense of the word. Shirley's seductive and ageless vocal is captured. The biggest fall of the album is the poor engineering; the loudness war is a growing epidemic. There must be a way to remaster or purchase quality version of all the albums that are being grinded down to.nothing by this emulsifying destruction. It's an excruciating experience to not be able to turn the volume up without the white noise and overdeveloped production withering away this beautiful craft. Switching gears; the opening track and the poppies track dont represent the full album. The largest and most dramatic number is Control. Very few and minute shortcomings with this release.<br /><br />Grunge, hard rock, electronic, synthpop<br />Hard rock, new wave, acoustic, 90's,<br />60's girl groupones that spoke to me personally. I like this album more than \\"Bleed. Like Me\\" I like the more Pop sound with a candy coated dark flavour. Listening to an album like Beautiful Garbage is essential because of Shirley's dark wickedness. Its Bittersweet. Not Your Kind Of People and Beautiful Garbage are considered wack by a lot of people I wonder why? Guess I'm different... who wants to be the same as everyone else.
B005GUQIDC|4.0|Kimbra's \\"Vows\\" CD is great.  She doesn't break any new ground, but she mixes catchy lyrics, great melodies and well produced music to make a rather enjoyable album.

1402217722|4.0|This book is  one of the earlier Heyer efforts, written in the 1930's.  It is a mixture of the light-hearted romp (the young 17 year old girl)and the pleasant gentleman of 35 who marries her on her request. When Honoria marries Lord Rule she marries into the ton, goes slightly overboard with gambling and gossip, and gets involved with the villain of the piece, Lord Lethbridge who has an ugly history with Lord Rule and his sister.  There are at least three young men who try to help Honoria out of problems she unwittingly gets into connected with Lord Lethbridge.  They are definitely written as light relief.  The book is similar to quite a few other Heyer books in that a young innocent lady gets into trouble with the world of the ton and is rescued by her husband, after many convolutions.  It is amusing and easy to read.<br />Linda Sheean

B005FITIDC|5.0|Wow. What a great story and the best part is it is true. Butler does an amazing job bringing to life the Sam Childers. The road from a criminal to a man saved and determined to make a difference in the world was very powerful. Some of my favorite moments are simply when Childers wants to see the things in Africa that his church group is being shielded from seeing. Clearly he knows there is more to what is happening over there than just coming into a less hostile area and building shelters. It becomes obvious that this man given a mission by God that he firmly wishes to fulfill.<br /><br />I did love watching the highs and lows this man endures because you can clearly see that everyone struggles even those who are saved have a struggle. You really get to see this man's take on being a Christian as he protects children from being forced into a life of murder and slavery.<br /><br />And what I love to see while watching Butler is how beautifully he embraces the character. He seems to really become the character.

1596912863|1.0|When I started Austenland by Shannon Hale, I was thinking light and fun. What I was not thinking was a book I nearly out down because of offense or a philosophical debate in my head.<br /><br />Austenland by Shannon Hale is the fictional tale of Jane Hayes, someone who is Mr Darcy obsessed, and she has been found out by her great Aunt Carolyn. Carolyn bequeths an unusal gift at her passing: a trip to Pembrooke Park to live in the Regency Era written about by Jane Austen.<br /><br />What's interesting is that Jane sees Pembrooke Park as the antidote to her Austen obsession. Every man she's dated is held up the Mr. Darcy standard, and now she has the chance to find her Mr. Darcy. But instead of things become clearer, they become muddier as she struggles to differentiate her Austen fantasies from her reality, and she doesn't know who is an actor, and who is not.<br /><br />What really frustrated me about this short novel is that I don't think Hale does a good job of resolving the issues that she raises. I feel like she dances on the line between judging her character and others because they indulge in this Austen fantasy, and endorsing it. Is it really okay to have your reality so influenced by fiction that you hold every real man you meet to the standards of the fictional Darcy? Is it okay to cheat on a spouse by indulging yearly in a Regency Era romance because they've settled for something less than love? Is that what love is...one of the romances out a Jane Austen novel?<br /><br />Honestly, my perspective is no, none of those things are okay. Jane Hayes herself seems disgusted by the length at which she, and the others at this resort experience have gone to indulge in this fantasy, and yet...well, prepare for the spoiler here... she ends up with her OWN Mr. Darcy. Seriously?! Hale, make up your mind!<br /><br />I love Jane Austen's work in both the characters she has created and in the genius of her writing, and I expected this book to be a fun hat tip to that work. Instead, it was an uncomfortable reminder of how some blur the lines between fantasy and reality, and about how complicated it makes life. I give this book one star. And I'll be sticking to Austen's actual works. Not some spin off fiction.k.

B0081KTI0E|5.0|With the film The Woman in Black, Hammer Studios returns to their glory days of supernatural storytelling, invoking the Victorian-type ghost story in superb style. Easily one of the most stylish, most chilling horror films of the last couple of decades, this one also has a heart (as the best always do).The story plays on both the cards of the heartbroken young widower in grief over his wife's death as well as the both sad and frightening vengeful ghost whose mystery plays out and creating a truly terrifying build-up.<br /><br />For his part, Daniel Radcliffe shows he can work as a reliable adult lead, supported by a highly experienced ensemble cast led by Ciar&aacute;n Hinds. The film itself glories in its dark, broken beauty and makes one reminisce about haunted house classics like The Innocents (1961). There are also fairly potent visual reminders of other classic films such as The Phantom Carriage (1921) and Hammer's own Night Creatures (1962). The colors, though by no means absent, are mostly muted (making a great contrast in the few instances where they exist as striking). The music is minimal, unlike most American horror films that overwhelm with score from beginning to end.<br /><br />The story, adapted directly from the Susan Hill novel of the same name (itself also the source of one of the most iconic, longest-running English plays) features all of the classic elements of a haunted house story: the large, imposing mansion, the foggy, stormy atmosphere, a background in tragedy... it's all there. The tragedy compels us to listen to the story and to open our minds to it. We each experience tragedy and loss in our lives, and that seeking to connect with what (and who) we've lost can lead us down a path of desperation, but we don't know what doors and to what horrors that desperation can lead to. That is one of the great appeals of the gothic ghost story, and it plays out in excellence here. As a traditional ghost story film, The Woman in Black may be \\"by the book,\\" but the book is as chilling as anyone could imagine.ut the book is as chilling as anyone could imagine.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I kept asking myself that question through the entire book and I can honestly say the answer is yes! I found myself relating to the Anna as I sure many other women did.

B007WA56SC|4.0|There is nothing new in this compilation, but it does serve as a good starting point for folks who have recently (i.e. the past 10 years) taken a liking to Kylie's music. Here are tracks from the four(!) decades Kylie has been making music, offering a nice mix from her bubblegum pop days to her 2010 \\"Aphrodite\\" offerings. The only thing really lacking is material from her much underrated 90's \\"Impossible Princess\\" era, but that disc is worth buying separately in its own right. \\"Timebomb,\\" the single she released at nearly the same time as this CD, is also missing. I'm knocking off a star for these.<br /><br />The DVD is nothing special either, but again, it serves its purpose in the spirit of K25, celebrating a quarter century in music, showcasing her early girl-next-door image, building up to the sexy yet classy pop princess she is today.

0123694965|5.0|When I first heard about this book, the idea of the lenses seemed a bit gimmicky to me. Maybe I didn't quite understand what the lenses were supposed to represent, or maybe the examples I looked at weren't informative enough. However, when I actually read the book, I found that the lenses were actually a really good way of organizing all the various related and intertwined game design topics.<br />The book is well-written and very fun to read. The language is not overly complex, yet at the same time I didn't feel like I was being talked down to.<br />I agree with the author in maybe 90% of the conclusions he draws, but even where I disagree, the way he lays out all of the information on the topic and his reasoning is extremely helpful to me to organize my own thoughts better.

Do NOT let anyone spoil this one for you by hinting at the underlying plot--simply allow Lehane's story to have its way with you.  A chilling, goose-pimply read.  Highly recommended.

0817439390|5.0|I have been shooting for almost two years so I had already understood most of what is explained. I have an earlier version, but it is pretty much the same. This book showed me things I don't already know, and the way Peterson describes things makes it easy to remember. My weakness is remembering ways to do things, and he knows how to simplify techniques so they become second nature. Buy this book and you will not be disappointed.

B0053TMP24|5.0|Riordan does a great job continuing the story of Percy Jackson in this book. I really love the way that the first set of books came to a conclusion for that story, but opened the door for a lot more. I'm hoping, through hints Riordan drops, that the next couple of books tie in the characters from the Kane series as well.

B0018LX9T4|4.0|Maggie Gyllenhaal exploded onto the scene in the early aughts, and it was her devilishly stunning turn in the kinky office drama `Secretary' that got her the bulk of her acclaim and spearheaded her to the front of the pack as far as talented young stars were concerned.  I'm still completely floored by the way she crafts such a complex character and still manages to make her feel so simple.<br /><br />The film is adapted from the short story by Mary Gaitskill.  It tells the story of a young woman named Lee who is from a very defunct family and certainly suffers because of it.  On the outset of the film she is being released from institutional therapy and takes a job as a secretary for a lawyer named Mr. Grey.  Almost immediately, their relationship turns toward S&M.  Both parties are obviously compliant with the idea and looking for the opportunity, and so when it presents itself they take full advantage.  The relationship seems to have nowhere to go but downhill, but `Secretary' takes a surprising turn in direction as it defies logic and creates a home for these emotionally crippled individuals.<br /><br />Spader is wonderful, truly embracing his dominant quality (and the comparisons to `sex, lies and videotape' are warranted) but it is Gyllenhaal who completely owns this film.  The way she filters through all the stages of her character's growth is flawless, and the way she communicates such yearning with her eyes (and the way she `takes it') is just marvelously rendered with great finesse.  She conveys emotions that hit hard and help to add depth to the subject at hand.  That is another thing that is so commendable about `Secretary' is that it never appears to prod or poke fun or dismiss this `situation' as a mere gag or gimmick, but it is always presented in a realistic and accessible way.  This film is far from judgmental, and while the ending can and probably should be seen as a fantastical representation of a day-dream, it is constructed in a way that feels authentic and `appropriate'.<br /><br />I'll echo the sentiments regarding the non-existent backstory for Mr. Grey.  It would have really been nice to add some depth or color to his character.  Lee's character is broken down for us in many ways, either obviously or within Gyllenhaal's presentation, but Mr. Grey is ambiguous to the point where it feels like a plot hole almost.  Alas, this is still a smart and witty look at a serious situation and it sports one of the best breakthrough performances of the aughts.<br /><br />The comparisons to that `Fifty Shades of Grey' trash is beyond me.thentic and `appropriate'.<br /><br />I'll echo the sentiments regarding the non-existent backstory for Mr. Grey.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|My first ex-husband recommended this book to me.  I had heard, like so many others, comments and reviews of this trilogy in several publications.  My ex was reading it and recommended it to me and I bought it solely on his recommendation.  As others have commented . . . as a literary \\"work\\" it's deficient.  As a purely entertaining \\"beach\\" book . . . it's great.  The author hooks your interest toward the end of the first book and then leaves you hanging.  I honestly debated about not purchasing the second installment, but decided I just couldn't NOT buy it! This trilogy will not improve your mind but will provide many hours of entertainment.  I also found myself analyzing how I am in relationships with the opposite sex.  I found Anna's approach . . . willing, open, accepting  . . . to be appealing.  Both characters are charming and likable . . . I found myself enjoying this series despite my negative first impressions.  I may even read the series over again!
B00005JLO2|4.0|I've seen the 1939 film.  I didn't like it much.  Outside of a devastatingly marvelous turn by Ralph Richardson, the film itself left me underwhelmed.  I know that this isn't popular opinion (by like anyone really), but I actually really liked this 2002 remake and consider it a superior production on nearly all levels (outside of that particular performance).<br /><br />At the very beginning of Heath Ledger's career (and by career I mean stardom, which is anything post-A Knights Tale) he tackled this remake of the 1939 classic (I use that term because of the general consensus of the film) and it was pretty much panned by critics.  It didn't matter, considering his talent and his good looks, and so his career continued to soar (something that can't really be said for either Wes Bentley or Kate Hudson), but it doesn't negate the fact that many consider this a stinker of a film and a missed opportunity.  I honestly had no idea that this was the FIFTH film adaptation of Mason's novel, but outside of the 1939 film I have yet to see any of the others.<br /><br />The story is an interesting one that encapsulates loyalty, cowardice and political responsibility as well as redemption of character.  It's a beautifully shot film and draws you in from scene to scene, and it is quite well acted, especially from Ledger and Sir-Screamsalot (yes, Djimon Hounsou is in this).  For all the naysayers, I'm actually on board with this one.

B0068MNO4S|3.0|So, if you are looking for an authenticated look at Shakespeare, look elsewhere.  This is a film that is obviously manipulated in many areas and serves for mere entertainment value at best.  It becomes apparent about halfway through that they aren't even trying to be logical here, but are merely trying to stir up controversy at every corner because that will keep people glued to the seats.  Sadly, the horrific acting almost made me want to get up and leave.<br /><br />`Anonymous' raises doubt to the authenticity of Shakespeare's fame.  This is a theory that has been around for years.  In fact, in school we debated this in Litt. Class and so I was well aware with the idea that Shakespeare himself didn't actually pen those epic plays that serve as the basis for so many of what we see and read today.  In `Anonymous', those beautiful stories were penned by a prominent figure, the Earl of Oxford, who hid his love of poetry from those closest to him out of shame.  Raised in a household that forbid the arts, Edward de Vere (the Earl) was constantly battling his paternal figures until a scandal trapped him in a life he didn't necessarily desire.  Decades later, and he is searching for an outlet for his life's passion, and he finds that outlet in a young aspiring playwright named Ben Jonson.  Ben, reluctant to brandish his name to the works of the Earl, is taken aback when his friend William Shakespeare steals the credit and becomes an overnight sensation.  While the film could have easily focused on the plays themselves and the controversy surrounding their author, it wants to encompass more than that and so soon we are divided between this story and that of Queen Elizabeth's successor, or the pursuit of one.  The two are obviously interwoven in a way that feels oddly soap operatic by film's end, and the scandalous twists that are thrust at us in the finale are an obvious ploy at `one upping' Shakespeare himself.<br /><br />It tries too hard.<br /><br />Overall, this was interesting conceptually, but it wasn't entirely handled with care.  It gets choppy and a little lazy in the way that things are tied together, and the cast is atrocious here, outside of Rhys Ifans, who is enticing and compelling and heartfelt in his every delivery.  Vanessa Redgrave, whom I love, is oddly uneven here.  Sebastian Armesto tries far too hard to add gravel to his voice and sounds like an idiot.  Rafe Spall is repulsive.  Jamie Campbell Bower is oddly effeminate and acts like a little boy, which is unbecoming considering the man he is playing.  Joely Richardson pulls out her inner Cate Blanchett, and not the good kind, and basically overacts EVERYTHING.  I mean, this is like a cesspool of performances that makes me cringe the more I think of it.  But yes, Rhys Ifans might make my top twelve Supporting Actor ballot for 2011, he was that good (and that out of place here).<br /><br />The film is beautiful to look at and rightfully garnered a Costume nomination at the Oscars, but the absurdity of the film's final plot lines and the performances contained make this a semi-mockery of a film.<br /><br />I should have known Roland Emmerich would drop this ball!teresting conceptually, but it wasn't entirely handled with care.

030758836X|2.0|I purchased Gone Girl as an e-book for my Kindle.  It started out as a captivating page turner for the first two thirds of the book, and then turned into an unlikely, unbelievably bad ending.  I felt like I been had--made a fool of for reading it, for spending time and money on all that trash talking and stupid ending.  I certainly will not waste time or money reading anything else by Gillian Flynn.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|`Sunshine' is not the film that you think it is.  When one reads on the film or sees the clips or the trailer or what have you, there is an impression left that is misleading.  That isn't to say that the direction taken on the film is a backfire of sorts, or that the impression left by the film itself is subpar compared to what one expects, it just means that this is not the movie you think it is going to be.  This is not your typical outerspace adventure.  This is not an action packed thrill ride.  It is thrilling, but that is for other matters entirely.<br /><br />Maybe the unexpected should be expected, when you consider the man behind the film; Danny Boyle.<br /><br />I've noted this before, but I love Danny Boyle.  Yes, I kind of hated `Slumdog Millionaire', but Danny Boyle is so much more than that, and the resume he's built for himself thanks to refusing to be pigeonholed it remarkable.  Whether he is dissecting the damaging effects of substance abuse or thrusting us rapidly into a post-apocalyptic world lurking with zombies or sustaining our attention while our protagonist is wedged between a rock and a hard place, Boyle is always engaging.<br /><br />That is why this film underwhelmed me, because of all the unexpected that took place, the one thing I NEVER expected was to be bored.<br /><br />The concept surrounding `Sunshine' is fairly intriguing.  In the future, mankind is forced to `jumpstart' the sun so-to-speak, for fear that it will burn out and life as we know it will end.  A group is sent to accomplish this very task, but along the way things break down in ways that threaten the mission.  Sadly, the brooding atmospheric pacing makes for a near sleep-inducing ride.  I like brooding.  I like slow paced character studies, but this film doesn't really develop those character's enough to remain interesting, and despite some solid turns (albeit somber and low-key) from the entire cast and some amazing special effects (they may not be used in abundance, but they are stunning to behold) the film kind of lays there, stagnant almost, for nearly the entire running length.  The film's finale is bold and daring and consuming, but it is a little `too little too late' for the sake of the film's impact and serving as a redeeming factor.<br /><br />Boyle has been far better than this.  This is not `bad', but it certainly isn't `great' and the fact that it squandered its potential is a major disappointment.t they are stunning to behold) the film kind of lays there, stagnant almost, for nearly the entire running length.

B004GUSG4M|3.0|If you've seen the film Memento, then Before I Go to Sleep will feel like familiar ground.  This is the story of a woman who, as a result of a head injury, suffers a form of amnesia that causes her memory to be erased each night when she goes to sleep. She thus wakes each morning not knowing who she is or recognising anything or anyone. In Memento, the central character holds onto scraps of memory by tattooing information on his body, in this book memories are captured in a journal. The unfolding recollection of events leading up to the accident that caused the amnesia is well told and with suitable suspense. The ending is a surprise, which is always nice. If you haven't seen Memento, it would be an even more rewarding read for having a [seemingly] unique premise. (And if you haven't seen Memento you should!)

B003AWRMCE|5.0|\\"Unforgiven\\" is set in early 1880s Wyoming and captured the Oscar for Best Picture for 1992.  The movie also won three other Academy Awards.  At the start of the film, a prostitute is brutally attacked, and a bounty is offered by those in the brothel to anyone who can kill the assailants.  William Munny (Clint Eastwood) travels to Wyoming with Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) in hopes of collecting the bounty, but Big Whiskey sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) is set on stifling any attempts at revenge for the attack.<br /><br />In addition to the first-rate cast, the cinematography was very good as well (\\"Unforgiven\\" was nominated for an Oscar in that area, too).  The characters are complex and have mixed motives--there are really no good guys here, and this is definitely the seamier side of the Old West.  While certainly there were showdowns between good and evil in the Old West, the film is an entertaining reminder that there probably were at least some noir episodes in that time and place as well.

B0036TGSR6|2.0|I waited for the twists - in every political drama you've got to have twists, but the one single twist is so absurd and adolescent in its lack of intelligence it's laughable.<br /><br />Stylish film, watchable actors - I'm sure Blair-haters and `Stop the War' merchants wet themselves with excitement watching this, but as an intelligent political drama it failed big-time.
0345803485|5.0|I must say that I had an absolute blast...and read the entire trilogy on my kindle in a single weekend.  Is the plot line obvious?  Yes.  Is the story too good to be true?  Also yes.  Do the characters often think or say the same things?  Sure they do...but don't we all?<br /><br />I loved reading the 50 Shades books because they were an escape from the real world.  Christian is ridiculously good looking (and we are led to believe) attracted to someone whose opinion of herself has not been terribly high.  The sex scenes are plentiful, highly detailed, and seem much more satisfying than anything possible in real life...which is why I could.not.stop.reading.  Man was it fun to fantasize right along with the characters as I read, and to take the books for what they are, the Kraft Macaroni and Cheese of the book world.  Delicious, filling, and tied to great memories, even though we know there are healthier, \\"better\\" foods out there for us.  A little Kraft every so often never hurt, and in the same vein, man did these reads feel good.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|\\"Prometheus has landed.\\"  You've all no doubt seen the bombardment of television advertisements ranging from ESPN collaborations with the NBA Finals to Coors Light ads featuring the impressive ship landing on an alien surface.  Ridley Scott defined the science fiction horror genre when he gave us an absolute perfect film in 1979: \\"Alien.\\"  There is nothing I can fault with this film.  It's the perfect blend of science and horror.  It uses suspense rather than gore.  It rarely shows us the creature lurking aboard the ship, yet we feel like we've been forced to stare at it's disturbing makeup for hours.  In fact, the alien (or \\"xenomorph\\") is only seen on screen for a total of 4 minutes.  In a two plus hour film.  You'd swear he was staring you in the face the entire time.  So, when Scott announced two years ago that he would be revisiting the universe he helped redefine, I was ecstatic.  I followed the film when it was known simply as \\"Alien 5,\\" then \\"The Untitled Ridley Scott Alien Project,\\" the \\"Alien Paradise,\\" and eventually, \\"Prometheus.\\"  It was penned to be a prequel to \\"Alien\\" wherein we'd get the story of how the xenomorphs came to be, who that big guy in the pilot seat of the alien space ship was, and then a beautiful segue into the opening sequence of the original film.  But then it changed.  Scott decided to widen the scope and take the story much further than we ever imagined.<br /><br />An \\"Alien\\" prequel, this is not.<br /><br />Those of you expecting to see the iconic creature roaming around the ship and picking off crew members one by one, will be sorely disappointed.  Those of you who are open to seeing something wholly original, with some very creative DNA strands connecting it to the \\"Alien\\" universe, will be incredibly impressed.<br /><br />The connections are few, but they are big, in my opinion.  You have Weyland Industries playing a major role, which it did in the original film, you've got androids, you've got LV-223, a moon in the same solarsystem as LV-426, the planet on which the original takes place, you've got the \\"Space Jockey's,\\" (or the big, fossilized creature in the pilot seat of the original film) and yes, of course, you've got a host of strange, bizarre, and disgusting creatures that are recognizable, yet unique, to this universe.<br /><br />The film's major drawback, for me, would be that it asks too many questions, gives us a half-ass answer to some of them, and then forgets about the rest.  However, since Scott has publicly stated the film is to be a new trilogy, it does make sense that we'd have to learn more from sequels to come.  This is just part one of the prequel to \\"Alien.\\"  This is part one of three, that will eventually lead us to the opening sequence of the original film.  But we're still a hundred years away from that universe in \\"Prometheus.\\"  The xenomorphs haven't even been created yet.  And yes, I said created.  It's hard to discuss this film without giving away major spoilers, so I won't say anymore about that.  But the creatures you do encounter are equally as strange, dangerous, and one of them (when we see it in great detail) is one of the most disgusting and revolting things to look at on screen that I've ever seen.<br /><br />The performances are, for the most part, very good.  Idris Elba as the captain of the ship is brilliant, Noomi Repace is very good as the naive young scientist who is trying to balance her faith in God with her work in science, Charlize Theron plays the ice-cold bitch perfectly, but it's Michael Fassebender's performance as the quasi-evil android, \\"David,\\" that steals the show.  It's nothing short of Oscar worthy, in my opinion.  His walk is reminiscent of Olympic swimmer Greg Luganis' and he parts his hair and models his dialect after Peter O'Toole in \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\"  He is amazing to watch on screen.<br /><br />What really shines in the film, though, is the incredible visuals.  It is a pure eye-gasm for two hours with the special effects.For the first time, the computer generated creatures look and feel like they have real weight and substance to them.  It's hard to tell if they are animatronic or computer rendered.  Every detail (down to peeling placental tissues on a \\"squid baby\\") is in place and makes you feel like you're there.  And the 3D is mesmerizing and the best use I've ever seen, even trumping \\"The Avengers.\\"  The sound is deafening and it all comes together for a true masterpiece of artistic genius.<br /><br />As for the \\"squid baby.\\"  Yeah, I'm not going to say anything else, other than the scene will surely go down as one of the great horror moments in the history of film, and that it easily rivals the shock of the original \\"chest burster scene\\" from \\"Alien,\\" when poor John Heard starts...choking.  This will be a scene talked about for years to come, I know it.<br /><br />In closing, \\"Prometheus\\" is a genius piece of science fiction art.  It's for the hardcore sci-fi fans, not for the folks who just want to see a horror movie with slimy monsters roaming around.  It's got incredible substance, it's got the most beautiful opening sequence to a film I can think of, and it's got top notch special effects that are unmatched, in my opinion, to date.  And even amongst all of the great acting, deep story telling, thought provoking ideologies and gorgeous set pieces, we still get a couple of nasty little creatures to help us get that \\"Alien\\" vibe.  And the last thirty seconds of the film REALLY give the fanboys what we were after.<br /><br />4.8/5 Stars, losing a tiny portion because of some big plot holes, but hopefully regaining it when the sequel answers those burning questions.

0553801473|5.0|I had the advantage of reading books 1-5 in a period of 3 months. After reading all the negative reviews on here for Feast and Dance, I was pretty anxious that my beloved story was going to leave me disappointed. But no, I didn't feel the let down that others experienced, perhaps because I was not anticipating resolution for years on end. We'll see how book six goes down. I have to say, I am not worried. I love the nuance and detail of Martin's writing and the fact that he does not write the story you expect to read. I turned away from fantasy years ago because the formula was just so dull,really geared towards a young person's idea of duality rather than the mature person's awareness that life is more shades of gray than comforting black and white. Martin reads more like historical fiction and I savor every morsel. If that does not appeal to you, this book will be a chore.

B008IBPECW|4.0|LOL..like  many soap operas, even British ones, they are addictive. If you plan on watching this and have the tendency to watch and watch and you just can't to sleep cause you want to see what happens, esp since you have access to the next episode at your fingertips...well, then watch it on the weekend when you don't have to go to work the next day or take off and waste a sick day!  LOL  Have you ever seen a British soap opera? Well they are all very similar (to me) and you get to see a lot of the same actors, wearing similar clothes from when they were in another soap, though it can be endearing to see them again. But if you say to yourself, it's nice to see you again (to the actor), you might want to take some time off from soap operas (day or night) all together and get some sunshine.  LOL  In any case, I recommend Downton Abbey.  Don't be disappointed when you find out when season 3 will be available!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Title suggests something else... when the plot is actually  about the journey of an unhappy married couple who are poorly written without any clear character distinction. Flynn writes both her characters to be uninteresting and pathetic and in turn both Nick and Amy turn out to be the same character although Flynn attempts to write from each character's subjective perspective. Flynn's novel would have been more bearable if Flynn would have just written from one perspective. Poor execution. In the end, you kind of just want to throw the book because you've endure the terrible journey of continuing to read this book because the plot ending is so incredibly awful. I did find myself laughing out loud at some parts when Amy talked about her spineless cheating husband, but that was really a small good section of this narrative. I suggest avoiding this book. I forced myself to finish it...
B004EPZ03O|4.0|I got this DVD purely as I am a fan of Jason Segel, as well as quite a few of the modern TV shows that I knew had actors in cameo roles in this movie. I was a fan of the Muppets as a kid, although the fresh spin off show was Fraggle Rock (there was also a cartoon with the Muppets in diapers), The Muppet Show itself was well and truly into the rerun stage by my childhood, and some of the Muppet characters, especially the band, were sort of like they portray them all in this a film, a bit dated, but I still liked and enjoyed watching The Muppet Show. Plus there was the odd movie out on video or on TV every now and then when I was growing up.<br /><br />So I found this a nice nostalgic trip, where when each different Muppet would appear, I would remember a scene from the TV show or their other movies such as Sweetums picking up and eating a girl with her legs kicking as she went down his mouth. That's a good thing about this movie, there's heaps of characters, so you do get to see them all. However this is also a bad thing as other than Kermit (and Walter the new Muppet of course), in an effort to fit them all into the movie none of the characters really have much air time. I don't remember in any detail but I'm pretty sure the other movies concentrated on say a group of ten Muppets (Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf and Animal plus maybe a couple of others) for most of the plot, with a lot of action and dialogue between the core group, with the other Muppets just having cameos or being in the group scenes. That's not the case here, this film doesn't really have much of a plot at all, it's a just a really basic skeleton plot of a couple taking a holiday to LA, where the girl hopes her ten year relationship boyfriend will finally propose and ultimately spend more time with her and less time with his brother. Unfortunately for her, he has bought an extra bus ticket for Walter, the brother who is obsessed with The Muppets. So of course they have to visit the old studios. By trespassing where he shouldn't be, the brother learns the ownership of the studios is about to be acquired by an evil oil man who wants demolish the place and drill for oil. The Muppets have a couple of days to raise 10 million dollars or ownership goes to him. Problem is the Muppets have all moved on with their lives, no one seems to care but Walter with the help of his brother and brother's girlfriend are determined to make them care and one by one come out of retirement and do a one off show to raise the cash.<br /><br />The overly simple plot and constant introduction of new characters works for an audience who are familiar with all the characters and have memories from their childhood. I don't know though that it has enough substance for a new generation of kids unfamiliar with these particular puppets to get much out of it, or to make them want to know and see more, as a lot of the funny lines are the characters making fun of the past, or the subtle references to the sexual harassment by Miss Piggy on Kermit and things like this which aren't in this film. Incidentally it hasn't been diluted totally from the show that it was on TV by the PC movement. (There's some plot spoilers here if you haven't seen it yet) Piggy does jump another Muppet taking him to the floor in a giant hug to make Kermit uncomfortable and leave her dressing room if he doesn't want to watch them doing that act, when he had gone in there to beg her to move on from their past and perform a duet on stage with him. She also brutally assaults another pig who they have employed to perform her part when she changes her mind and now wants to be a part of the show after the other pig tells Miss Piggy too bad, she's now doing the part. Gonzo also murders all his employees for no apparent reason instead of simply selling the business and negating the whole need for the fund raiser concert.<br /><br />The cameo actors don't for the most part have many if any lines which is a bit disappointing, they are also from mostly adult of TV sitcoms such as Community, Big Bang Theory, Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother so kids of the age the Muppets target market is probably won't be that familiar with them so may get no enjoyment from seeing them on the screen at all simply because they don't know who they are.<br />Jason Segel the main human character (Gary) pretty much plays the same character he does on How I Met Your Mother and every movie he's been in so far throughout his career. Amy Adams (Mary) plays the neglected girlfriend, including performing a few choreographed musical type numbers such as Me Party extremely well. There's a few catchy new songs in this movie such as Life's a Happy Song and Man or Muppet done well by Segel, Adams and the Muppet voice actor singers, as well as few classics from past movies designed to help with the recall of memory flow such as Rainbow Connection.<br /><br />The movie's villain and the other main human actor Tex Richman is a bit tacky and a cliche. There needed to be some sort of motivation besides being an oil man to give his actions in wanting to wipe the Muppets history for the modern day some substance. A childhood flashback where Kermit or some Muppet ran over his dog or something to motivate him down his path of hate. I also found Walter's special talent to be pretty average after it was being built up throughout a large portion of the movie.<br /><br />What was really entertaining is the special feature The Longest Blooper Reel Ever Made, where the Muppets are playing their non character fictional actors stuffing up lines and interacting with each other. I guess I liked this so much because it was so much fresher, original and different to what the movie itself was going for.<br />On its own this movie is unlikely to bring The Muppets a fresh generation of fans who have Shrek, Toy Story and other franchises to compete for their entertainment. In short if you're old enough to have grown up with the Muppets, you'll enjoy this trip down memory lane, although I don't know how many times you'll watch the DVD again in the future, which you may have if it had a plot with a bit more meat to it.g, they are also from mostly adult of TV sitcoms such as Community, Big Bang Theory, Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother so kids of the age the Muppets target market is probably won't be that familiar with them so may get no enjoyment from seeing them on the screen at all simply because they don't know who they are.<br />Jason Segel the main human character (Gary) pretty much plays the same character he does on How I Met Your Mother and every movie he's been in so far throughout his career.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|THIS APP MAKES IT SO EASY TO LOOK AT EBAY WITHOUT GETTING OUT THE BIG COMPUTER. I LOVE EBAY ANYWAY AND BEING ABLE TO GET TO IT IN A TOUCH OF THE SCREEN IS WONDERFUL. I LOVE MY KINDLE. IT MAKES THING MUCH EASIER.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Some people told me that it would start out slow but keep reading. The beginning was not slow, it had me hooked after the first several pages. Christian is freaky, yes he is, but his attraction to Anastasia is something beyond words. Yes he has a dark side, but I love the fact that she is the rebel and she definitley stands her ground with him. She totally takes him out of his element...control. That says a lot about a woman that can change a man that is so accustomed to being in total control. Gotta love her.
0439023521|5.0|These books are one of the best series I have read ever. I could not put them down. I read all 3 and turned right around and read them again right away. I have never done that with any other books ever. Even Harry Potter which I love I read them about every 2 or 3 years again. I really don't think I can put into words how great this is. I suggest this to everyone to read or if they don't read see the movie.
0345803485|1.0|I was stupid enough to think that since so many people were raving about this book, I might as well invest in buying the first and second books in this trilogy.  I should have saved the $22 plus postage and spent it at Starbucks or on some worthwhile piece of literature.  It is truly juvenile crap written by a high school girl who has never experienced sex herself and can only fantasize (incorrectly) what it is all about.  The sex scenes go from bad to worse until I found myself alternating between annoyance and \\"Geese\\" you've got to be kidding.  Ana climaxes at the drop of a hat or in this case Christian's clothing or his mere touch.  In fact she has so many climaxes and it is so repetitive I was able to watch the Olympics and read the book and not miss a beat on either of them.  The Olympics are much more entertaining and exciting actually.  Now they want to make a movie out of this book.  I can guarantee you, it will be a short one - boy meets girl, girl falls for boy.  They have sex, it is earth shattering.  They have sex again and again and again and again.. done. Now what am I going to do with the second book?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got the first book before leaving for a 2 week vacation out of the county I firgured I better buy all three because I wasn't sure with being away if I would be able to get it. Espically if it was as good as everyone told me. I struggled to read all three. With the story it had it could of been really good however it had no good follow through. It was more like really. It is very repetitive to the point I had to stop reading or skip over parts so I wouldn't throw my kindle. Plus there are words in there that I had to use my kindle dictionary. Just use words like tired, excited or thrilled instead of something I am positive 95% of your readers never even heard before. I know some people love this but I guess I don't get it there are so many better series out there like Harry, The Hunger Games, I am number 4, etc those series I can't put down when I read those. The only advise I would give if you want to read this read the first book before deciding to purchase all three.
B004EPYZV2|1.0|Am breaking my own determination to never review on this sight again - too many questionable people and too much unacceptable language is allowed here - but this \\"movie\\" is just too bad not to share.<br />The only redeemable thing regarding this charade is the footage of the outside of the skyscraper in Dubai.<br />Tom Cruise has always been and at 50 will always be a enigmatic figure in the \\"great\\" wasteland that is Hollywood! He is not in any way more than a high-school quality actor, is of limited physical appeal and has the talent of an earthworm. When checking as to the people responsible for such a mindless, plot-less, freak show was not surprised Mr. Cruise was one of its creators.<br />It would seem his overall attributes are as limited as his marriages!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is such a great game!!!! It is super addicting!! I would sugguest this to anyone. I have a kindle fire I play on and the screen is great can't image though playing on a smaller screen.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow, I really like this DVD and her Kickboxing Fast Fix. I own the Ripped in 30 DVD too but didn't like it. The workouts for Ripped in 30 are intense and it was so hard to tolerate her egotistical attitude but NOT with 30 Day Shred. She was so supportive, sweet and understanding. She still brought the heat so there's no let down there when it comes to the workouts. There's no yelling at you or saying dumb rants that do not motivate you to keep going or buying another one of her workouts. I found this DVD at the thrift store for $2.50 and had to buy it. I'm SO glad I did. Please note that the workouts are NOT 20mins but more like 25mins. Either way, it's a good thing and you will enjoy the DVD. There are 3 levels and each one increases in intensity as you go through them. I did levels 1 and 2, it was rough but well worth it in the end!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got this because I got crossme the regular one. My husband yells at me to put my kindle down because I play it to much. I love how it makes me think!! Great buy!!
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Another great album by Kid Rock. There are some great songs with other musical greats. This is one of his milder albums compared to his past work.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Bought and read this out of curiosity and i dont get it why lots of people are talking about it. This is one book i wont bother to recommend.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|A couple quick comments:<br />Very happy with the overall product.  Lightweight, small form factor, provides good protection.  It doesn't interfere with using the product.  The elastic strap keeps the cover in place (but really don't use it that often.  The kickstand feature is okay, if you bump it it will pop out, but the tradeoff is a thicker cover to have a deeper recess; they found a good compromise between functionality and thickness.<br /><br />No hesitation in recommending the product to anyone.
B001NLKT60|4.0|You kind of get hooked on Larsson's books - once you read the first, you just have to read the second and third books. You keep thinkking Tattoo girl has to trust someone eventually or die. Book #2 was pretty exciting and the ending makes you immediately order book #3.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Such a great story! Read all three books in 5 days! This might be my favorite of the three.<br />Would recommend it.
B008CP92ZO|4.0|After much protest, I watched Wanderlust. Jennifer Aniston is the kiss of death to many of the movies she has been in. This time around, she doesn't do too bad.<br />Director David Wain, Paul Rudd and the rest of the cast of new-age hippies keep this comedy moving along. It can be sweet,<br />inspiring, and extremely uncomfortable all in about 5 minutes. While there isn't anything new offered with Wanderlust, there are plenty of laughs. It's well worth a watch.<br />If you are a fan of The State, Stella or Wainy Days, this movie is going to be right up your alley.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Knowing how this trilogy starts out, its hard to believe that this book is a very touching love story.  I think this is a must read for men and women alike.  There is no one type of person to enjoy this trilogy... young or old you will love all 3 books.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have tried a lot of sound board apps to find the right sound to get my baby to sleep sound. This is by far the best one. I mixed three different water sounds to get the best faucet sound (she loves the sound of the faucet).

B007P6VLRS|5.0|It took a fair amount of convincing from reviewers for me to buy this album.  I had pretty much written off the group after the last album.  Sure glad I did take that chance.  The songs on this album grow on me each time I listen to it, and that has been quite a few times now.  The opening track Quazar is a good track that slowly builds and fits nicely in the opening slot, but it gets buried by the superb quality of the NEXT 8 TRACKS.  All the way through Pale Horse it is song after song of greatness.  The quality fades after that, but how could it not.

034580404X|3.0|Heard so much about these books, I finally caved in & bought them. I had a hard time getting through the first book. By the time I read all of them, I felt the story could have been told in one book.  At times, I couldn't put them down & then other times I just kept wishing the author would just get on with the story! After awhile, I just passed up on the sex scenes.  My grown children couldn't believe I was reading the books.  Glad I finished them all.  I still do not see what all the whoopla was with the books!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I thought it was going to be real games. these were not what I thought I was getting. fun but more aimed at a younger audience.
B0086HJW76|2.0|I was looking forward to this. After 20 years or so I thought Joe would have something great for us. But sadly, it's short, not to sweet, and misses the point. It sounds like polished up demos, nothing new here. Joe writes a nice ballad, but he's written much better than this. really dissapointed.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The application is great! The only problem I have is that I can not get the devotional aspect to work or sync with the passages.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|The dvd was exactly what I wanted. It arrived at my house 2 days before the estimated time given for arrival. Good packaging for this dvd and the extra features are great;especially the \\"Better Call Saul\\" commercials which are hilarious. a must for any fan. Amazon delivers.

1469984202|5.0|It's hard to point to just one thing that makes this book a must read. Not since Brave New World has an author offered such an eloquent story encompassing the trials and tribulations of one of many horrific, yet conceivable futures. Man's base nature is explored and challenged by societal constructs and treads the fine line between knowledge vs. survival for the common good. Absolutely fantastic and thought provoking read.  I look forward to reading more in this series, as well as exploring this author's body of work.  Thank you for this amazing story!
1469984202|5.0|great! read it or go to the cleaning! haven't read anything like it...i've never reviewed a book and felt compelled to comment on this one. you know, i love seeing a few illustrations throughout the book, added bonus!
B007BLUD30|4.0|This was an good film.  A great cast of characters.  It was fun, clean, and quotable with a good story.  \\"The maid's gone rougue\\" is my husband's favorite line from the movie!
B008N1LL42|1.0|This, by far was and is the worst...movie...ever. I have never, ever, felt so cheated out of my money or time than at the end of this pathetic excuse for a movie. ANYONE who rants and raves about its qualities, and/or gives you a detailed plot description is a movie spammer, paid to write reviews. I am a 37 yo male, who went with my 26 yo old brother to this flick. We love action movies, super hero movies, war movies, apocalyptic movies...you know, man movies....action, guns, fun movies. Smart movies and no-brainer movies. This, this movie is so, so, so bad we were appalled we stayed. I can not over-state the HORRIBLE-NESS of this movie.<br /><br />And to emphasize this point, I have taken time from my evening, with my wife, before watching another movie, to finally write this stinking review. Go ahead, don't believe me, spend your _.99 they want for it, you'll see. Good luck!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is simply mesmerizing....another one you can' t put down....it appeals to all women...20 year-olds to 70 year-olds!  A new favorite!!!!

0984334904|5.0|It was a great decision to buy these flashcards. The number 1 thing is that the flashcards are in hiragana and a bit of katakana. So, yes that means no romanji (which is really great for helping you learn the language.) The cards have stroke order, similar kanjis, pronunciation for both readings, radicals, stroke structure and so much more. THIS IS WORTH INVESTING IN IF YOU WANT TO LEARN JAPANESE. Not to mention there are 2 booster packs to the already 300. There is also a kana cheat sheet included which is great for that unknown kana. So... don't wait and just buy the flashcards. Trust me you won't regret it.

B005CMSDLE|5.0|Genetic engineers modify little Hanna to be their ultimate warrior. However, they don't anticipate that she may not appreciate this modification sixteen years later. It's kill or be killed for Hanna. The engineer, when asked \\"Did she turn out as you expected?\\" replies \\"BETTER!\\" and should have heeded the warning from herself. Kids grow up.\\"
B0002VFXFE|5.0|People wrote much better (and more technical) reviews than this will be but let me say this: this stuff really works, and works well!  The price is great and other reviewers have great instructions that will help you use it as it ships without instructions.  This, combined with opening up and cleaning out my laptop fan, rejuvenated my computer - saving me hundreds I would have spent on a new computer and squeezing a few more years out of a machine that would have been scrapped otherwise.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Cool movie, cant wait for next one.  Has shaky images at beginning but go's into real movie after 15 minutes. Hopefully they make a sequel.

0375842209|4.0|It was a very good story, I really liked it, connected to it and cared about the main character. But the ending just kind of cut off with a couple sentences to explain about 65 years....huh? What happened, how did she get to where she was, there are no details and I felt cheated.
0446547573|5.0|Awesome story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and unable to stop reading! Unbelievable ending that keeps you wanting more. Nicholas Sparks is an awesome writer who knows just when, where, and how to add excitement & suspense to keep you guessing and always wanting more.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Definitely worth reading! Much better than the first book. Really answers a lot of the unknown questions that fifty shades of grey left.
B0086700CM|5.0|This was one of my first apps on my i pad, and i love it to this day! It's very fun. The graphics are EXCELLENT, the sounds are great, and there are plenty of funny pictures with captions each time your character.. well... you could say \\"dies\\", but they always come back. Each character has their own unique photos and captions!<br /><br />Here is a amazing fact: You don't need to pay real money to actually ENJOY the game for a change! How exciting! You also don't have to worry about ads, but you can turn them on if you want. If you able ads, you get some free money in the game (and the ads are barely noticeable and don't run while you are in the game. only when you.. uh.. \\"die\\".<br /><br />The point of the game is to collect coins while running away from evil demon monkeys (kind of weird i know, but the game still rocks.) on the ruins of a lost and ancient temple. If you get enough coins, you can visit the coin store where you can buy all kind of neat features: from power-ups to new characters to run with, and without having to pay real money! What a excellent deal!<br /><br />A small shout out for the graphics: Terrific! Outstanding! They are very real and smooth. The producers of this game really are the pros, transparently! such time it looks like they put into it! Double thumbs up! In fact, triple thumbs up! So impressive!<br /><br />Overall this is a great game. It costs no money, for a great deal. I wonder how they could not charge for this fantastic game! I mean it when i say that this is by far one of the most excellent apps I've played! colorful, high quality, and realistic. If you have anymore questions feel free to post a comment. I check back to all my posts frequently.

1847667015|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo225ODVO5G6ARA]]<br /><br />THE AUTHORITATIVE WORK OF REFERENCE ON STATUTORY NUISANCE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />What is a nuisance?  What isn't a nuisance?  As illustrated graphically on the cover of this now well established and definitive guide to the subject, there are plenty of nuisances around as we all know.  From howling dogs to killer-driller roadworks operatives, nuisances can be the bane of urban life in particular.<br /><br />But however nuisance is defined, where does the law stand on it and related issues?  Now in a new third edition from Bloomsbury Professional, `Statutory Nuisance' provides what has become the definitive and authoritative guide to this complex and often vexed area of law.<br /><br />As Lindblom J notes in the foreword, `the law in this field has become complex, at least in its application.'  If you're involved with, or concerned in any capacity with nuisance, you would do well to acquire this book. Not only is it a user-friendly guide to the subject; it also provides the primary materials needed in court.<br /><br />`A book with practical considerations at its heart,' says Lindblom in the foreword, adding that `judges have found this book useful and have cited the views expressed in its two earlier editions.'<br /><br />What is also noteworthy about this book is that it airs a number of views on a number of issues which the courts have apparently not yet resolved. `The essential foundation of the law of nuisance', as the authors, McCracken, Jones and Pereira, note in the Preface, `is good neighbourliness'- the importance of which was recently cited by Her Majesty The Queen in her Diamond Jubilee message.<br /><br />This new edition of `Statutory Nuisance' presents and examines lucidly, and in depth, all recent relevant case law and legislation pertaining to nuisance, including the Equality Act 2010... Criminal Procedure Rules 2011... recent Court of Appeal decisions... new civil procedures for abatement notice appeals... and of course much more.<br /><br />As nuisance can and does impact severely on everyday life, this practical and clearly written work of reference will be of interest not merely to legal practitioners, but to the wider public - as well as professionals in other fields, such as, for example, local government environmental health officers, community groups, CAB officials and their legal advisers.<br /><br />Within its more than 700 pages, the book is also a treasure trove of avenues for further research, including tables of statutes, statutory instruments and cases.  There are no less than nine appendices, some containing further bibliographies and glossaries, plus a detailed index at the back.<br /><br />Appendix I is `a list of useful links'. Useful!  We would say indispensable, as is the book itself.  The publication date is stated as at St George's Day 2012.urt of Appeal decisions... new civil procedures for abatement notice appeals... and of course much more.<br /><br />As nuisance can and does impact severely on everyday life, this practical and clearly written work of reference will be of interest not merely to legal practitioners, but to the wider public - as well as professionals in other fields, such as, for example, local government environmental health officers, community groups, CAB officials and their legal advisers.<br /><br />Within its more than 700 pages, the book is also a treasure trove of avenues for further research, including tables of statutes, statutory instruments and cases.

B0063IH60K|3.0|This is an enjoyable game;  however the pop-ups can become quite annoying.  They appear after each game and sometimes it is difficult to get rid of them.  This is an easy way to pass the time while waiting for an appointment.

034580404X|5.0|This series is very good, I was unable to stop reading.  The price for boxed set was very reasonable. [[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]]This series is diffinately for woman but men could learn a few things from Christian Gray
B007SGM084|5.0|Its a very easy read that hard to put down. It's very easy to put yourself in the shoes of the main character and feel drawn to the character of the fictional Mr. Grey, a charcter that would otherwise be a repellant individual. The plot was suspenseful and surprising even if the outcome was expected. The thrill was in the journey which is fine by me since the journey last longer than the end.

0525478817|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time. If i had the time i would have finished it in one day, although i didn't want it to end! I'm 25 and I haven't read a 'young adult' book since maybe middle/high school and i loved it. I was immersed in the story since the first chapter. John Green is an amazing writer. I found myself re-reading some sentences and dialogue because they were absolutely brilliant. The bad reviews on here don't really make any sense. Sure they don't talk like normal 16 year olds and if they did..what would the book be? It wouldn't be anything. It's different and that's what I LOVED about it. It wasn't meant to be realistic. I can agree with some people on the Peter Van Holten plot (especially towards the end) and the fake cigarette thing but still a great book that I will definitely read again.
B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|The fact they are located in Argentina and it takes 3-4 weeks to receive your cd is horrible! I buy jerseys from China and get those in 7-10 days tops. So when I contacted them they (Diego) was extremely rude when I voiced my concern as to when will I receive my item/cd. Diego in turn basically sent me emails saying if I did not like it I can buy else where and that is what I will do. I only bought from them because they seemed to have a resonable price but I did not realize this cd was also manufactured in Argentina, isn't this piracy?<br /><br />Just goes to show that it is not necessarily better when you buy at a lower price because the time I had to wait to receive this cd was NOT worth the overall price. Their shipping is ridiculous to wait as long as I did. Also they ship in a very cheap package and the case was cracked upon delivery. All buyers beware, this is a seller that does not really care about the customer. Think long and hard before you buy anything from this seller, good price or not.<br />I will not and do not recommend this seller. I will never buy from this seller again.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Norm Coddington

0345536886|5.0|John Grisham is a professional. He has written, as everyone knows, some of the most successful, high-profile legal thrillers in the history of American fiction, and is a household name. I did feel that a few of his more recent novels were growing slightly weary, but in \\"The Litigators\\" he seems newly inspired, perhaps by injecting a liberal dose of humor into this quirky, intelligent novel.<br />I'll not rehash the plot here, but simply state that the characters are believable, interesting, and as usual, his dialog and attention to detail make this a wonderful read, and had me laughing out loud at the bizzare yet feasible circumstances that play out through this fun read. Can't wait for the movie!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was terrible.  I only finished it because I expected something to happen; couldn't believe the same drivel could continue ad nauseum.  It was the same thing over and over and over and over again. Just read the reviews; they are more interesting and better written.
0553108034|4.0|The story in book 2 kind of slows down for me but don't get me wrong, it is still good and will keep you reading for hours at night. Just wait till you read book 3!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm proud to be reviewer 1,500 for this wonderful book(s) (Wool 1 - 5).  I love a well written book and a good story, and this is one of the best I've read in years.  Amazon may need to establish a six-star rating.  Mr. Howey is a special author and I will brag that I read his work back when he was self-published.
B007I2BZIE|1.0|I have been a fan of Rush since 1982. My first album was Signals. Rush's skills increased and became better and better under Terry Brown until they put out their Opus Magnums: Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, and Signals. Then it all started to go downhill. Finally, at some point, Rush released the horror that was Vapor Trails, and they can't get let go of this new medium.<br /><br />This album sounds like Vapor Trails. The bass is muddy. The guitar super-saturates everything. There are no melodies. The lyrics are sad and dark. The drums are barely audible behind the ringing echo-chamber of guitar. The cool hooks and solos of the past are nowhere to be found.<br /><br />This is not music. This is art. I do not want to listen to art that is smarter than I am. I want to listen to music. Signals was music. Good music. This album is like the painting The Scream. It's art, but I don't want to stand around and consume it.<br /><br />Make it stop, Rush. The Garden is the only serviceable song. Find Terry Brown, renounce your arrogance, and admit he made you what you were in 1982: a great band with an awesome, rich, beautiful sound.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the second in a trilogy.  The depth of the characters portrayed by the author is spellbinding.  Many have said that the sex in this book is too graphic, but I feel that the sex is secondary to the real issues that affect Mr. and Mrs. Grey in the book.  This book, along with Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Freed is a great page-turner read.  I recommend it highly.

034580404X|5.0|I have not picked up a book in many years.  I am soo glad my sister in law kept bugging me. I heard that this book was Mommy Porn,  That is a lie.  These books do have intimate pages but, there is a LOVE story behind them.  It is a wonderful story of how a man and a woman have to deal with trying aspects of their lives.  I am reading the books again, and probably again after that.
0061969656|4.0|Certainly a must for fans of the Saxon Tale series. I enjoyed this book, however I finished it far too quickly due to it's low number of pages.

B000WJSCZE|1.0|Good information - but way too many words than what was required to say the same thing. I feel the information was extrapolated to make it book size - I would have preferred more visual/graphic examples and less fluff
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|All I can compare this mic to is the built-in one on my D800.  The mic on the D800 is really nice, but I've had all I can take of the motor noise of the AF system.<br /><br />External:  Packaging is as expected, mic comes in a paper box - with cut foam fitted for the mic.  (Years ago, I bought a similar mic made by Sony called a \\"Zoom Mic\\" that was shaped like the letter \\"Z\\").  Rode's mic was packaged similar.  Hmm, no coupon for a free dead cat.  Wish I had bought this when the dead cat was offered.  I did get the dead cat anyway (more on that later).  I've seen a lot of comments regarding the plastic build.  I like the lightness and since the feel seems solid enough, I am guessing the plastic is a good choice?  The shock absorber does make the mic feel a bit fraile.  For those who do not know (the \\"Z\\" mic mentioned earlier did not have this feature...) the mic sits on a rubber shock absorber and not fixed solid to the base.  This helps keep a lot of excess noise down.<br /><br />Internal:  The manual is nice - but the instructing for getting the nine volt into the mic - lol - well, it does take some care and attention.  The good side(s) though is that the battery will NOT fall out, and you do not have to change the battery too often.<br /><br />Mic function:  Very NIce.  I turned the camera's mic input down, and left the mic on \\"0\\" gain.  While capturing video, I watched the vue meter on the camera just to be sure that the input was not too loud (away from the red).  This worked nicely.  I guess I will have to tweak/retweak every time I use the mic.  Every situation/location will be different.  While I like the extra controls (i.e. mic gain/cut, and high pass) it'd be nice if this can be done auto-magically.  I can slightly still hear the AF motor, but I really have to concentrate.<br /><br />I did order the dead cat and after figuring out how to put this thing on, all is well.  Is it worth $30?  lol.  There are videos online of folks making similar devices much cheaper and works just as well.<br /><br />HTH.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is better than book one...mainly because the shock of book one has blown over and the love story develops.  It isn't until book three that the story really comes full circle.  This is so ADDICTING!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I was very disappointed with ALL THREE of these books.  I read all three and I thought the content was extremely disappointing.  Over kill with the sex and very close to porno.  I believe the writer is very talented and should have tried for one book. Just way too much sex.

B007PVHMCG|4.0|We were fortunate enough to get one of these for $35 for our kids.  Our sons love both Minecraft and LEGO, so this was a big hit.<br /><br />The issue I have is that I couldn't get a second set for boy #2.  Why?  Because the scalpers grabbed them and holding them for ransom at over double the price.  If you watch the prices, they get bought up as soon as one is available for $35, then just as many hits over $70.  Please Amazon, stop this ridiculous behavior.
B0088RQ4TI|3.0|It was just ok, I expected a whole lot more even though it did not do so well here in the states. I gave it a try because it had a mix of history/science fiction and action. I think I should have waited untill it came out on cable....

B004DK5CW4|2.0|Secretariat was a wonder of nature.  Watching him run gave me goose bumps.<br /><br />Why did it take so long for someone to make a move about this magnificent horse?  Considering the quality of this movie, they should have waited longer. This movie was not about the horse but his owner.  Secretariat was, and is, exciting enough for the entire plot.  Why dilute the plot with the owner's \\"story\\"?<br /><br />It was poorly edited.  The plot was sort of slowly moving along and suddenly Secretariat was being called the wonder horse.  There was certainly nothing in the movie that justified that title at this point in the movie.<br /><br />Even the cinematography was poor to average.<br /><br />I agree with most of the oomments made by the 1-star and 2-star reviewers.  And did trainers and grooms of high priced thououghbreds really use hay nets?<br /><br />I was disappointed.  Secretariat deserves better.

B00000JLWW|5.0|Within this review there are two things: my thoughts on the film, and a parental section with good information on different topics parents should know about before allowing their children to watch Titanic.<br />MY THOUGHTS ON \\"TITANIC\\"<br />In simplest terms, I can put Titanic as \\"The Greatest Movie In History.\\" The film \\"Titanic\\" rates a 5/5 on my scale, as it is the most beautifully sad romance story that kept me on the edge of my seat (and the verge of tears) throughout the entire film. WARNING: From this point on in the review, there may be spoilers :WARNING. So, the film is basically all about two people, one first class woman, and one steerage passenger who wins their ticket aboard the Titanic at a poker game. The two become star-crossed lovers and, when the ship hits an iceberg, their love only gets stronger and stronger until one of them dies.<br />As I said earlier, I would rate James Cameron's Titanic 5/5. However, the current edition I'm reviewing rates 3/5 because the special features are not, in simple words, \\"good\\". I suppose a better way to put them would be \\"nonexistent\\", although it is saved from being 0/5 because the menus are so beautifully done, and the entire 3h15min is compressed on one DVD video. I almost cried just seeing the menu images, knowing the story of the Titanic.<br />If I was rating the VHS version, it would receive 5/5 stars, as it's the original, and the only version of Titanic I can seem to find in fullscreen.<br />If I was rating the special collector's edition of Titanic, it would rate 6/5, as it has three discs. The first two are, obviously, the film, with many additional special features, and a third disc with all special features. And the disc is PACKED.<br />Unfortunately, I don't have a Blu Ray player, and I can't comment on any other versions of Titanic, as that is all I have. I am a lifelong collector of this film and, if you don't already know, Titanic will have a hi-def DVD release on September 10, 2012! Way exciting!<br />PARENTAL SECTION<br />While a wonderful movie, there are many things parents don't know if they haven't seen Titanic all ready. And if you're buying the movie thinking \\"it's a nice history lesson for my child or teenager\\", you might be upset if you don't know some of the stuff in the movie. For example, some parents don't want their teenagers seeing nudity, which they will see briefly if you let them watch Titanic on DVD (more details ahead). I have broken down everything in the movie for you, and it's listed here:<br />Violence: Well, the ship sinks, and there can be some pretty violent and disturbing deaths. We see dead bodies floating around in the water, and at one point, one of the life boat attendants picks one up, and we get a closeup on their dead face. Jack Dawson dies, suddenly. People fall off the Titanic as it's up in the air, and they slide to their death. People can be seen shooting one another, or even themselves.<br />Profanity: As far as I know, there's one f word, two or three s words, b@stard is used a few times, the middle finger is given once by Rose, and there are lots more religious words used throughout the film. It's not too bad in therms of profanity.<br />Alcohol Use: Smoking is shown throughout the movie, and some of the characters drink alcohol, although the scenes in which alcohol are involved are very minor.<br />Sexuality: Rose asks Jack to \\"draw me like one of your french girls wearing this, and only this.\\" Then she takes off her clothes and has him draw a portrait of her. We see her breasts for an extended period of time during the movie. Later, the couple are lying in the back of an old vehicle atop each other, meant to symbolize that they just had s3x.<br />Scary Scenes: Well, it's a big ship that gets hit by an iceberg and sinks, leaving thousands of people dead. As long as you're not going on a boat ride any time soon... well, you be the judge. Would something like that bother your child?<br /><br />If you just read this entire review, THANK YOU. Hopefully you got as much information out of this as I had to share, and hopefully Amazon doesn't reject this review due to length. I certainly said all I think I have to say about this, the absolute best movie in the history of film making! This movie deserves to be recognized as the all-time best film, hands-down! Buy it, regardless of price, or condition! Worth it!
0307951529|4.0|Someone told me about Chris Guillebeau's blog, The Art of Non-Conformity, a few years ago. I get his emails twice a week and when I actually read them, they always contain really good info. So when I heard about \\"The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future\\" I was intrigued.<br /><br />If you've got a business idea brewing, this is a book to read. Too many people have been led to believe that you need lots of money to start a new business. It's simply not true. All you really need is a product or service you enjoy providing, that serves a need and improves life, and enough people who are willing to pay for it. Simple, right?<br /><br />Chris interviewed hundreds of entrepreneurs who started their businesses with very little money - the median startup costs was $125 - and built successful, profitable ventures. He shares many of their stories in this book and you'll be amazed at what some people are doing to bring in 6-figures+ a year. They're drawing artistic maps, helping implement lifestyle diets, teaching foreign language fluency, etc. These businesses don't require a college degree or special training and were started by people based on a passion or hobby.<br /><br />Essentially, he proposes following six steps. 1. Decide on your product or service. 2. Set up a website. 3. Develop an offer. 4. Ensure you have a mechanism to get paid. 5. Announce your offer to the world. 6. Learn from steps 1 though 5, and repeat. Yes, very basic.<br /><br />The book then walks you through each step in more detail, but the point throughout is It Doesn't Have to Be That Complicated! People (maybe you) make business too complex and it can be done much more simply.<br /><br />Each chapter has call out boxes with key stories, explanations and points and if you were really in a hurry to get through it, you could read just those and get the gist of the information. I recommend this book for beginning entrepreneurs as well as seasoned business owners who've been trying too hard. Come back to the basics and see if it can rejuvenate the sense of freedom and fun you've lost.siness owners who've been trying too hard.

0425263908|4.0|I have read the Fifty Shades of Grey (50) books and loved them. Not for the sex part, though interesting and didn't realize that really exists but I loved those books for the romance, the characters and the emails were my favorite parts. So the mini segment for Bared to You reminded me of those books but decided to read them.<br />There is a part of me that loved the book. I was rooting for these characters to get it together and find each other beyond sex. And can't wait for the next book. We all have baggage and bring different things to a relationship. And I love the cultured demeanor of Gideon, his experience of life, he knows how to dress, works on trying to be romantic, can dance. Again, cultured. Which is missing from so many men these days. It's no wonder women devour these books because we don't seem to have it in own lives. Some do and yeah for them. I would love the return of these types of men.<br /><br />However, how can this book not be consider plagiarism? Almost every detail is like the 50 books. Although this writer is good, too many details are the same as 50 shades and it seemed wrong. Just another rewritten version of a good book that made it big. Reminds of TV/Movie issues these days. They just keep rehashing the same old tv shows or movies over and over because they can't think of anything new. The writing is good, the subject matter/characters have been there, done that. Just an observation.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|What else can I say about The Big Bang Theory.  Superb writing and superb acting.  This is a very funny show.  I have all 4 seasons on DVD and anxiously await the release of Season 5.  I can't get enough of these \\"geeks.\\"  An then there is Penny, played by Kaley Cuoco.  The show wouldn't be the same without this very talented and very very pretty woman.  And then of course there's Sheldon.  I have one word for Sheldon...BAZINGA!
B008CJ0KEM|4.0|A must have for those Sci-Fi/Fantasy lovers out there, especially those who once loved Buffy and Angel - two series Lost Girl is constantly compared to. It is, however, targeted to a more mature audience, given its sexual content. Bo (played brilliantly by Anna Silk) is a Succubus raised by humans that runs away from home once she drains her first boyfriend to death. Ten years later, she is found and targeted by the Fae when suspiciously leaving a body behind after protecting human sidekick Kenzi (Ksenia Solo) from a man at a local bar. Bo soon learns that the Fae are divided between Light and Dark and refuses to make a choice -- which is a parallel to Bo's own sexuality; a bisexual Succubus, constantly torn between two lovers: Light Fae detective Dyson (Kris Holden-Ried) and human doctor Lauren (Zoie Palmer). The first season is about Bo's search for her true identity as we are introduced to the Fae world and its various secrets and ramifications.<br /><br />The love triangle is one of the show's biggest draws, particularly because both lovers bring something different to the table: Dyson, the territorial alpha male, provides sexual healing - literally - in an electrifying friends with benefits relationship with Bo. Lauren, the fragile, geeky beta female, provides the human warmth and emotional connection/support Bo so desperately needs. The latter is particularly satisfying because Bo and Lauren's relationship isn't played for male titillation; it is straightforward, it is real and it resonates with the audience. Their chemistry is heart-wrenching and beautiful and fortunately, only a taste of what's to come in season 2.

1463514581|3.0|Twenty Eight and a Half Wishes was a cute read. I managed to finish the book within a couple of hours of starting it, and I was left wanting for the next book, Twenty Nine and a Half Reasons.This was a good sign.<br /><br />I was impressed with how spot on Denise was, with the small town southern community and the people living in it. Coming from a small southern town in Alabama, I understand how people gossip and judge, and know (or think they know) everyone's business. You are who your family is, and if your family isn't well known, then you are about 5 rungs lower on the totem pole than the nearly homeless vagabond that is passing through town. People don't respect you as much, and they are less likely to lend a helping hand. Living in that type of town has it's advantages and disadvantages. For Rose, it was allllllll disadvantages. lol That poor girl got shafted by everyone, and they had no qualms with being open about their distaste for her either. If I were her, I would have turned tail and run.<br /><br />As far as Rose Gardner goes, I found her likeable and detestable all at the same time. She goes from being a shy, timid, inexperienced, people pleaser, to a loud mouthed, confrontational, know it all, who suddenly has a knack for all things fashion, and she does it within a matter of sentences. I can't tell you how badly this chapped my ass. lol I know from personal experience that A) people who grow up shy and timid and basically abused, do NOT just change their entire persona at the flip of a switch (or in her case, someones death). Are we supposed to believe that a person who for 24 years never talked back and never experienced life, would all of a sudden be tech savvy and worldly because she wrote a bucket list on the back of a walmart receipt? I think not! It was like a completely different person and the change was just unrealistic. B) I don't care who or what introduces you to makeup and fashion, you can't be a master beautician and cosmetologist after applying your makeup and doing your hair TWICE. And YES, I would know. haha C) Relationships for people who have never had one, are not as easy as pecan pie. She knew wayyyyyyy too much for someone who knows nothing. Again, it just was very unrealistic. *sigh* I do love Rose though! She was funny and charming and polite. I just didn't buy her big swan transformation.<br /><br />Joe. Dear, sweet, hunky, and incredibly obvious, Joe. lol He was like the John Wayne of BF nowhere, tiny town, Arkansas. All bedroom eyes and foaming at the mouth with jealousy. I tell ya... if it wasn't obvious enough that he was who he was, then I don't know what would have been. I guess my only complaint about him, is that he was kind of wishy washy about her honesty and believability. Pick a side and stay on it! Don't act like a love sick control freak, and then question her motives. It's not attractive. =/ He was however, very endearing and gentlemanly, and I approve of that.<br /><br />Violet - Rose's sister - was insufferable. She embodied everything she used to harp about and then some. I was rooting for her through the whole book. Hoping that she would come around by the end, but it just never really happened for me. I wanted to smack her upside the head and tell her to stop being a hypocrite. *Le sigh*  Her husband was to be pitied too, and I just wanted to hug the poor guy. lol I suppose that Violet is like most first born children, in the sense that they feel the need to Mother and control and guide their younger siblings. They have a hard time letting go of the fact that they aren't really needed and it makes them worse. I think this is Violet's problem. So let's not judge her. lol<br /><br />All in all, the book - like I said earlier - was cute. I might pick it up again in the future and re-read it because it's definitely worth the time.r applying your makeup and doing your hair TWICE.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very dull in the first 7 chapters but after that it is getting to the storyline. Looking forward to the second book.
0345803485|1.0|Bought the three books because of the hype.  Wasted my money as it turns out the the hype is just a \\"misery loves company\\" thing.  Now all of us have wasted our money.  It's obvious the second two books were \\"cut and paste\\".  There wasn't even an attempt at a storyline.  E James just needed a new car.  Don't waste your money folks, just go out and buy some real porn - written by professionals.  Guarantee it will be more exciting and probably more of a story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I felt this book was written very well. The layers of thoughts that were narrated by Ana are exactly how women think. The mysteries of Christian Grey's life caused you to want to continue reading and made it very difficult to place on your nightstand. I highly recommend reading this book. You might as well buy the trilogy because you're going to end up having to read it whether it's the type of book you usually read or not. Enjoy!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it really helps keep track of how low your battery is and tells you what the temp of yur device is which is great because my device overheated and would not turn on for two days

It's an amazing series that's hard to put down! Be sure to read all of them!
0316023744|5.0|REVIEW: Masterful descriptions make The Second World War by Antony Beevor a must-read<br /><br />By STEPHEN FRATER<br /><br />In The Second World War Antony Beevor has delivered an epic, brilliantly researched work on the defining event of the 20th century.<br /><br />Beevor is the author of the New York Times bestsellers D-Day, The Fall of Berlin 1945&iexcl; Stalingrad, yet those works were mere preamble to his latest work, arguably the best single-volume history of World War II yet written.<br /><br />Beevor, an ex-British Army officer, unfailingly and even-handedly casts light onto the feet of clay upon which all mortals including generals, dictators and presidents, must stand. Titans such as Roosevelt, Stalin, Hitler, Churchill, de Gaulle, Mao, Mussolini and Eisenhower are on full display, warts, foibles, insecurities, egos, errors and all.<br /><br />While portraying the grand sweep of the conflict, Beevor never loses sight of the intensity that this unique global bloodbath represented for both soldiers and civilians caught up in the war&iexcl;¯s bestial, unfathomable terrors.<br /><br />Beevor&iexcl;¯s complete, confident command of the veritable Mount Everest of World War II data, his new research and his pitch-perfect narrative represent a truly astonishing display of art and craft. The Second World War is history at its very best, readable at all levels, compelling, character-driven, original, compassionate and insightful.<br /><br />The author masterfully describes the conflict's global reach - one that included every major power and left more than 70 million dead. Beevor controversial findings include new information on:<br /><br />Operation Mars in November 1942 (the deception to keep German troops away from the Stalingrad front as the Red Army launched its great counteroffensive there). The operation was deliberately betrayed on Stalin&iexcl;¯s order to German intelligence. The Soviet armies involved were also deprived of artillery ammunition to support them. This ruthlessly cynical sacrifice produced 215,000 Soviet casualties, roughly the same as all the Allied casualties for D-Day and the whole of the Battle for Normandy.<br /><br />The Tokyo war crimes tribunal. Charges were never brought against Japanese officers for a deliberate policy of cannibalism. Across China and the Pacific, Allied prisoners of war and local people were kept alive to be butchered for their meat. This atrocity was suppressed for the very understandable reason that it would have traumatized the families of all those whose loved ones had perished in a prison camp, since they would never have known if they had been eaten or not.<br /><br />The assassination of Adm. Francois Darlan in Algiers in December 1942 and how officers from the British Special Operations Executive were closely involved in it. American officers from the OSS also knew of the plot in advance, but neither informed their seniors.<br /><br />The strategic bombing offensive against Germany by the U.S, Eighth Air Force and RAF Bomber Command. Though highly criticized, it had a far greater effect on the eastern front than has yet been acknowledged.<br /><br />The attack on the Panther tank factories contributed to the postponement of Hitler&iexcl;¯s Kursk offensive to July 1943, with disastrous results for the Wehrmacht. And the relentless bombing of Germany forced the Luftwaffe to withdraw so many fighter squadrons from the Russian front to defend the Reich that German air reconnaissance was unable to spot the Red Army&iexcl;¯s massive offensives in advance.<br /><br />This book, which crowns Beevor's distinguished and bestselling career, is one of the nonfiction events of the decade and for this reader, is by far the best nonfiction of 2012 to date.<br /><br />Stephen Frater, a former Herald-Tribune reporter, is the author of Hell Above Earth.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Overall, a very entertaining series. I do hope that this is still a work in progress as the \\"end\\" seemed more like the \\"beginning\\" to me. As such, I envision there is so much more to tell within this story, with the characters, the Silos.<br /><br />While I read through, I felt there were a few points where the author lingered but realized in retrospect, these overly large areas in a somewhat short series were needed for the reader. They allowed a better finish to main character development and allowed the reader to catch up within the story.<br /><br />This is one the better fictional reads I've been fortunate to come across.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I had extremely high hopes for this book...although its hard to find a good read these days, the books in the top100are never too dissappointing. This one, however,  was. 50 shades of grey is basically twilight except there's a lot of, almost comical, sex. I'm not a huge twilight fan but I gained a whole lot of respect for the twilight saga after reading this. \\"Reading this \\" is an overstatement. I didn't even get halfway through before I was highly regretting my purchase. Here are a few of the many things that I couldn't stand....<br />-There is of course the girl whodoesnt think herself that attractive but is in fact,  as everyone else seeems to think,  very good looking. And of course she ends up landing this perfectly manicured hottie who is extremely intimidating (the author might as well have named her bella swan)<br />- okay I can understand a 21 year old woman who is a virgin...its not that common but its possible. But a woman who's never had her hand held by anyone,  and whos never pleasured herself. I mean come on how naive can you get<br />- the writing. There's not much I can say except that when I looked up the author I was surprised she wasn't a 17 year old girl.<br />- a guy as perfect as grey? Please. This isn't an erotic novel. Its an erotic fairytale.<br />-THERE IS ABSOLOUTELY NO PLOT. There's a promisimg plot at the beginning but as you continue to read all they do is have sex and email each other. Not even good sex at that.<br />This is all at the top of my head. Why has 50 shades of grey gained so much hype? I certainly cant answer that.
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed these books especially since they are so far removed from my usual read.  The characters interesting in their different points of view and the banter back and forth via e-mails was enjoyable.  The love making and raw sex was descriptive.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time, beautiful prose and fascinating characters.  I couldn't put the book down, still trying to find something new of the same style to read.
B006W33UC4|5.0|All I can say is amazing!  I can't get enough.  I hope there will be a second installation.  Hearing parts to songs I know well that have never been available before makes the tracks feel brand new all over again.  Love it. Where Disco comes from, the template to dance music as we know it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Lived the characters. I was never bored. The sexual tension was great and left you wondering what would happen next
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it was awsome I love it so much!!and anyone who says different is stupid.it is way to fun!!!!!you won't regret getting it.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|This is a great game to play. It is one of the best role playing games I have played in a long time.
0307592731|3.0|My review is not about the book content.Although, after reading the first few pages I'm already hooked on it. This reveiw is about paying a first line price and receiving a seconds hardcover book.  It appears to me that where or whomever this book shipped from worked at a book manufacturing factory, taking the seconds for themselves and selling them online at a handsome profit!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is excellent for those that like to see big buttons!  This makes it so much easier to handle. I cannot see anyone not finding this useful.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I think this game is great but can be a challenge some times if u don't have this game get it now!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007P06DJK|5.0|I just remembered this CD a short time ago and decided to purchase this edition. What a pleasure! I had missed this music and especially Lady Smith Black Mambaza combined with Paul. I LOVE it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to discover this most awesome thriller. I literally dropped my kindle when I got to the mid way point because I was so incredibly stunned!  I found it very refreshing to get blindsided by a twist in the plot that I never saw coming.  This is a must read.
0684857219|5.0|This book has excellent advice and excellent indepth excercise information.<br />Clear and easy to understand excercise steps and good diet information.<br />Highly recommend.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is my first Kindle purchase -- and it was a great one.  The Hunger Games Trilogy is a story that holds your attention and I really do not want to stop reading.  And then of course I will need to see the movie!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Enjoyed the quality of the films transfers and audio. One thing though... while I like the artist intent as to the case design, it is not very intuitive and can be damaged easily by someone who does not know how it opens yet.
159448385X|5.0|Splendid! Absolutely splendid like a THOUSAND SUNS! Easy to read and absolutely heart touching. Khaled is a master of story telling! Must Read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A Beautifully crafted unusual novel. Incredibly suspenseful, very worthwhile. I don't really get the people who rated this one star and \\"vulgar\\"? Really?
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Like most David Baldacci books this was an easy read.  I can't wait for the next book with Will Robie as the main character.
0307970299|2.0|I was expecting a book - not CDs - and so I was quite amazed when package arrived.  I bought the book after that from Costco and will find a friend who will hopefully appreciate the CDs.  I do not know WHY I didn't recognize what I was getting.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|The Unity Band combines PMG and Methney Trio/Quartet works.  The songs are written like PMG compositions without Lyle Mays keyboard and the various percussionist.  Beautiful songs.  The saxophone work pairs up nicely with Metheny's virtuous guitar playing.
B006RQNVDO|5.0|But I'll say more.  They say that there is a fine line between genius and crazy - Robin Williams has made a career out of showing us the edge of that line with his genius comedy and yes, even drama.<br /><br />We hadn't see this movie in forever and the kids had never seen it.  Was great to find it quickly and easily on Amazon Prime and give the kids a hint of both Robin Williams' genius and just a hint of what one angle of the Vietnam War looked like lest we all forget that war is always personal.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|The latest release from Rush is brilliant.  A story about the journey taken by a young man in a world where everything is ordered and controlled by the loving Watchmaker set to some great music by Rush.  Clockwork Angels is still in heavy rotation on my playlist after a couple months.  I am still hearing new things with every listen.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing spider everyday wen I have time to. I could posy this in my sleep. its so fun to play e'en u don't have anything else you to do. I love how it is free on the apps store.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This game is fantastic....I wish there few more creative layouts<br />Because I don't want to stop playing!!!!  Ito back to better my time...very fun.!!!!
0634022296|4.0|This book is hard to keep open on a music stand or table. Because the book is fairly thick and it isn't spiral bound, I've had to resort to using metal clips to hold the book open at the song I'm playing.<br /><br />That said, the chords and lyrics are accurate and all the Beatles' songs are included. A nice extra bonus is that the chords for each song are diagramed at the top of the page.
B00079FUI6|3.0|Kinda disappointed..One of the discs was so scratched it wouldn't even play....the rest were ok. I mean when u buy a season u don't want to miss 6 episodes
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Updated to new version a week ago, with new level. YET ERASED ALL PRIOR PROGRESS. Now a week later another update and ONCE AGAIN ERASED ALL PROGRESSIVE AND REMOVED THE NEW LEVEL. WTF !!!!!! GET IT RIGHT AND STOP ERASING MY PROGRESS.
B004R36QUE|5.0|Walking out of the movie, I knew I had just seen the best movie of the year, and frankly one of my all time favorites. Pay attention to Helena Bonham Carter- She is terrific and provides the foundation for Firth and Rush to give great performances. If only more movies were this good.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|There are other devices that have gotten the updated version of this game a long time ago, while KF users still have the older version. The new version is better than what we have now; where is it?
B00004YRQA|5.0|It is a memory card and it works plus I can save all my games now. Anyone who has a playstation 2 should get this
B00846REIS|5.0|If you like Fifty Shades of Grey, you will like this book. It keeps you entertained, hard to put down!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Kinda easy but past the 1st 3 lvls it gets challenging.  Definitely a great time killer plus the newer lvls will keep you busy.
030758836X|1.0|Do not, I repeat, do not waste one dollar or one minute of your life on this godawful mess of a book.  Horribly written, absurd plot, inane characters and utterly unworthy of your time.<br /><br />I feel real anger toward the author of this book for her apparent cynical and manipulative approach to writing and publishing.  It's as if she read an article entitled \\"How to draw in the poor ignorant masses and make them think they're reading an intricately plotted mystery.... when all you've done is concoct a mishmash of characters and event without any meaning whatsoever.\\"  UGH!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|There are many opinions about this book. Some women say that it is degrading to women. I like to remember it is a Fiction book and it is hot! The story is great and the sex descriptions although not trashy can be descriptive. Love it.
1932907009|5.0|This book helped me get my novel outlined when I was stuck on certain plot points. The beat sheet concept is a tried and true formula for a successful narrative in film, and it translates quite nicely to literature. Plus, it's a general good read. Who isn't interested in movies? Once you learn the tricks of successful screenplays, you'll see it in EVERY movie you watch. Unless it's a terrible movie in which case you'll be able to see how it could be improved by applying the principles from the book.<br /><br />If you've hit a roadblock with any sort of narrative arc, this is the book for you.
B00322PKBW|4.0|Back in the late 80's/ mid 90's, I loved my Swatches. Stopped wearing them for years, but recently decided that I wanted to get another Swatch. I decided (even before shopping around) that I wanted a blue one. Was unsure about ordering this because I always wore the smaller ones in the past, but I fell in love with this Swatch online, so I got it! I quickly adjusted to the slightly larger size, even wore it with my old Swatches (all on one wrist) at a 1980's themed party!! Yes, it ticks very loudly -- I put mine under my rolltop desk at night -- but the compliments are well worth it ;-)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this entire series.  I read all three books in the trilogy in about 10 days.  I just couldn't put them down.  Every free moment was spent reading these books.
B007URCTOG|5.0|This is a really emotional, frustrating, and amazing story! Great film. I loved it and recommend it. Watch with a box of tissues!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Love the game but wish it took less time to regain energy and you didn't have to spend extra money for added stuff.
B005WQ4QW0|1.0|Jusy wanted to see a scary movie so rented this one on a recommendation.  Not scary. Just disgusting. Don't bother with this one.
B003E88TKS|3.0|This movie has great previews and promised more or I have expected more. It was not disappointing, however, could have been little better for my taste. There are correspondingly really good things about this movie. It's not a must watch, yet it might be appealing to some of you. I give it anywhere between 3 - 3.5 stars. :)
0345803485|3.0|I wanted to see what all the excitement was about, so I bought 50 Shades to read on a short vacation. It was so exciting (not!) that it took me two months and a certain amount of stubbornness to get through it.<br />I suppose the compelling part of the story is the odd narrative way that the inexperienced Anastasia describes being drawn into a romance with the Christian, the handsome young billionaire. (Christian, we learn, is deeply flawed, but he is not a scoundrel.) Never having been a young woman, I can only speculate how well the author did at conveying the inner thoughts, fears, and desires of Ana, although my gut tells me that she's pretty close.<br />I had some trouble with the dialogue and flow. The characters are a little too incredulous as they move through the action of the story. Every few pages it seems, someone gasps. Maybe I'm overly stoic, but I don't remember the last time I gasped, nor do I recall much gasping going on around me. (Unless the car windows were up and KC had eaten Mexican food, but that's not the same thing.) Further, in her own mind, Ana says `Oh my!' when she's surprised. My best young, modern woman reference, the redoubtable KC, would be thinking `Holy _ _ _ _!' (insert four-letter word of choice). These may seem like minor things, but they bugged me every time they happened, and they happened a lot.<br />This is supposed to be a very sexy book, but the sex scenes are more `R' rated than `X' or `NC-17'. There weren't as many of them as you'd think for 500 page book either. A friend asked me how good the sex scenes were and I had to admit that I fell asleep while reading one of them. If your sex life has been very conservative, you might find the scenes racy or provocative, but if you've ever had a playful partner, you'll find them pretty tame. The wild bondage and discipline that I expected never really appeared until after page 500 when the dance between the two main characters rather abruptly culminates in a single genuine spanking.<br />As I reached the end, I laughed out loud, realizing that the entire book was some sort of weird idealized allegory for sex, albeit from a woman's point of view: there were 500 pages of foreplay, then finally Wham! Bam! Spank you, Ma'am! And it was over. I won't be reading the sequel, although the Cliff Notes might be interesting.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It seemed like it was written by a British teenager.<br />Americans do not say \\"My driver will collect you\\".<br />\\"Jeez\\" repeated throughout the book. I will not bother purchasing 2 and 3.  I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing #1.
B00782O7NE|1.0|I am unable to review The Artist, as the copy I received could not be played in Australia (wrong region)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Was hooked on the book and read it in record time!  Could not wait to turn the page, however, was a bit disappointed by the ending...It kind of left me hanging and I was hoping Amy's lies would catch up to her.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i have no problems with the game and i am already addicted! i would reccomend the game to my friends and family.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|First thing is first, I must say that I really like unreliable narrators.  I like reading things from the perspective of someone who is unlike me and then having to move ideas around in my mind so that they make sense with my own understanding.  However, and I say this with no judgement, I know some people get super annoyed with this extra step of understanding.  That being said, I feel like this book does a great job telling a story with only a minimal extra step.  I feel the author did a great job being as literal, yet whimsical as a little kid is and telling about some unpleasantness.  Actually, since the little one is telling the story, stuff that could be very detailed and very scary, is made a little more bearable.  I would say that this book is heavy on description and character development.  There is some action, but mostly it is a character study and a good one at that.  All these things make this a book I LOVE.  Also, there is some stuff that might be hard to read if you have been through an abusive situation as it might put you in the same headspace.  (Not graphic, but I'm sure it still might be difficult.)
B0064T6LV8|4.0|This game has nice fast paced action and easy controls. The graphics are nice and smooth. It is a very enjoyable game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow!  Sometimes I get jaded and feel like authors follow formulas even when they put in twists.  Flynn does not do that!  I love it when an author can throw me off the trail and make me stop and go back and examine my own opinions about something.  That is what makes a book good!  There were a few times where I questioned the motivation of the characters and doubted they would really do something, but for the most part I thought it was well written and sure to keep you a little off center, which is just fun!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|After hearing about the whole Angry Birds craze, I really didn't want to like this game. It sounded like a game only kids would enjoy. But I love this game! I must admit that I was hooked on this game. I played it non-stop until I got 3 stars on each level. It takes strategic thinking and problem solving. I didn't like that I could not figure out how to end the game after getting 3 stars on all levels. I probably have to take some more time and try to figure it out? But for the most part, this is an awesome game!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|addicting, almost too addicting. I played for almost 30 minutes without realising it. for a free app this one is a must to have.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great. It's simple to use and understand. It won't do anything fancy but its fantastic for simple, quick math. Five stars.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I like the custom sounds.  But I don't like that you can't run it in the background.  Just ok. Not great.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept your attention the whole way through, but the ending was anti-climatic. I was disappointed in the last chapter or so because you could definately see just where it was headed.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|This album features several guest appearances.  It also features some of Buddys most Hendrix inspired guitar sound.  This has quickly become one of my favorite Buddy Guy albums, more because of the blistering, soulful guitar work.  If you're looking at purchasing this album then you already know what to expect.  This, however, is a bit of a different sound from Buddy.  If you love blues, you're sure to enjoy.  Thank you Buddy!
B0086700CM|5.0|Best game app I have played in a long time. It is very addictive, in a good way, and hard to put down.
B005LAIGIM|3.0|This movie was so so. Eddie Murphy is funny, to the point of overacting. I did really laugh at a restaurant scene. Yes, the plot is somewhat poignant and trys to get a little deeper towards the end, but I felt this movie fell short of what I expect from Eddie Murphy. Also, it amazes me the language that passes for PG-13.<br /><br />A Thousand Words is good for a few laughs, but for the most part, forgettable.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless by Eric Blehm describes a real-life Rambo named Adam Brown. Adam, a Navy Seal Team Six member, was far more inspirational than Stallone's character in the Rambo series. In this book, Eric shows us a man who fought demons on and off the battlefield. Unlike Rambo, this man knew God and from his very beginnings, Adam lived invincible.<br /><br />Eric describes the stunts Adam executed, even as a child that could not do much more than crawl. His parents had to saw the legs off of his crib so Adam wouldn't have far to fall. From climbing out of the crib, to launching himself off of the roof as a toddler, to jumping as a teenager from a speeding car over the 70 West Bridge 20 feet into the river, Adam felt no fear. Instead, he saw possibilities.<br /><br />In fact, one of his coaches on the football team said this:<br /><br />\\"That one little sophomore (Brown) taught our whole team more about character in a few minutes than any of us coaches could have in an entire season. He wasn't going to be the big star lineman that his brother was, but what impressed me was this kid was not scared. He was determined that he was not going to let his size keep him from doing whatever he wanted to do.\\" (Pg. 22 and 23)<br /><br />Some people seem touched by God--those remarkable spirits who don't get to live into their old age. They are like that shooting star in the black sky, streaking through the night, capturing your attention, then its gone; and yet the experience, or in this instance, the influence, the impression stays with you forever. Adam Brown's story felt just like that. What Adam never said with words he exemplified in action. That was until crack got into his system.<br /><br />That demon, as his steadfast fianc&eacute;e and eventually wife, Kelly, said was a voice that always called him back to the addiction. Desperate to escape that addiction, Adam got clean and joined the Navy; then, applied for the Seal team.<br /><br />Adam's Rambo performance, his loyalty, team work, and his belief in God influenced many team members. The man was well-loved by many far and wide. Kelly describes Adam as a thoughtful and dedicated father and husband. In spite of many long missions away from home, their marriage grew strong.<br /><br />Eric Blehm brings Adam's life alive, writing Adam's story through massive interviews and well researched information, giving honor to Adam's Seal mates who would later not survive another mission. Eric easily inducts your heart into the story. Adam, in every way, was a walking example of what it means to be a Christian. How he handled the ups and painful downs of his life left its mark on me.<br /><br />Adam's family, team mates, former team mates, acquaintances, and an entire community mourned his death. He died in battle in Pakistan. One life affected these people, and he didn't write a word. He lived life passionately, imperfectly, and poured his soul into every day, making the most of the time God gave him here. Later, his team mates exacted revenge when they took out Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />God bless the military. I gave this book five stars.<br /><br />Book given by publisher to review.k, and his belief in God influenced many team members. The man was well-loved by many far and wide.

B0061S073A|5.0|I love this app, so far the best one I downloaded to my phone.<br />I like to give my child the opportunity to use her own games and apps without being concern that she will open or delete any of mine. It also has a timer to let her know when she have been playing enough.<br />It is a must to have it if you let your kids to use your phone or tablet devices.<br /><br />Me encanta esta aplicación, hasta ahora la mejor que he instalado en mi teléfono.<br />Me gusta darle a mi hija la oportunidad de usar sus juegos y aplicaciones sin preocuparme porque pueda abrir o borrar las mías. También tiene una alarma que le permite saber cuando ha jugado lo suficiente.<br />Es mandatorio tener esta aplicación si dejas a tus hijos usar tu teléfono o tablet.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|The app is simple to use and is easy on the eyes. I love how the background is animated with the current weather. Great app for a great price.
B004SQS9FA|4.0|This seems to be a pattern when it comes to some Radiohead albums.  I have to listen to it a few times before it grows on me.  It was really after their \\"In The Basement\\" session that I really got into this album (same thing happened with \\"In Rainbows\\").  Although it's not my favorite of theirs, it ranks up there, to me, with \\"The Bends\\".  I know they've evolved so much since \\"The Bends\\", but as far as my favorites go, it's not at the top of the list.  \\"Codex\\", \\"Lotus Flower\\", \\"Give Up the Ghost\\" and \\"Separator\\" are my favorites.  How they continue to experiment with different instruments and sounds amazes me.  What disappointed me was that \\"Daily Mail\\" and \\"Staircase\\" wasn't put on the album, but were separate singles.  What I admire is that their albums always start and end well.  It always makes you want to hear more.
1416572295|4.0|I have read - frustratingly - many books on quantum mechanics. Based on the title of this book, I hoped this might be more appropriated to my level of understanding. It is wonderfully written. The conversations with the dog were both amusing and educational. Nothing was dumbed down. It covers a range of quantum theories. It goes into sufficient detail to satisfy. Very much recommend.

1439127700|5.0|Great book!  I am a history teacher and this book provides a combination of two things: It is a great review of<br />American History since Harry Truman and an excellent source of anecdotal information which will be very useful in a classroom.
B007SGM084|1.0|I don't even know where to begin. I guess I could start with the rating. I gave it 1 star because I had to put something down. If I had a choice, it would be none. The writing is HORRIBLE. Now, I'm not calling myself an author by any means but this makes me worried for our future. First, my biggest problem is how degrading and disgusting the sex scenes are to women. Come on, ladies! He gets angry and the only thing that can quell his anger is sex? You are being used. Not to mention the fact that it is frustrating to see the female character back down at every scrimmage. The sex scenes are so frequent and so no viable plot is created. AND the SEX SCENES-only interesting if you never get sex or have never had sex. My fifteen-year-old brain would have loved this set. Another annoyance, the outlandish dramatics. Each time the characters face adversity the outcome is always tied up in a pretty little bow-pun intended. I was also irritated by all of the British colloquialisms- seriously? Until they married little Ana hadn't even been out of the the good ol' U.S of A. Why wasn't the story set in the UK? Oh yes, in order to capture an audience one MUST replicate Twilight. Gross.
B00154GEFU|5.0|Asia Phoenix is highly underated! This album is full of beautiful sound and very musical. It reminds me very much of (ALPHA) wich happens to be my personal favorite asia album. Keyboards really shine here and the album doesn't sound so dry like most music of recent past due to lack of keyboards. I don't know why keyboards have been getting such a bad rap. In the past 20 yrs music has become really dry sounding. Keyboards really help create the mellody in music and (ASIA PHOENIX) shows that. Just listen to their 2 albums that followed (OMEGA)&(XXX) the sound is dry and not on as big of scale as (PHOENIX). Much better effort here. May i also recomend the new album by \\"SAGA\\" (20/20).
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie. Better then batman begins but just right under TDK. Tom hardy does great as bane. I hope this beats the avengers in box office. Great job by Christopher Nolan. 9.8/10

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a good story  , most appealing to a younger group I would think ,enjoyed the story line & it kept my interest , hope ,loyalty ,perseverance & human spirit were on display , all told very interesting story line .
B006LSZECO|4.0|Captivating and surprising which I enjoyed.  Most often I can guess how a story might conclude, but this one surprised me.  Also, I loved the way the narrative swung between the husband and wife and their polar opposite views of their marriage. Clever. But it's one-third into the book where you can't put it down.

0307592731|5.0|I was surprised at the negative reviews, glad I read them after reading this book.  There are some major spoiler alerts!  What some described as disturbing and graphic were so integral to the story, and while I am generally sensitive to these things, the context they were in was appropriate.  Her love for her mother and how deeply she missed her really resonated with me.  Particularly when she had to say goodbye to \\"Lady.\\"  If you have ever lost someone so dear, those things that were dear to them become a representation of the lost loved one.  After my mother died it was hard to get rid of a piece of scrap paper she wrote on.  I get it, Cheryl, thank you for writing this amazing memoir and sharing so honestly what you went through.  I felt like I was with you on the PCT.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B003XF1XOQ Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]I Know that the word \\"riveting\\" is oft times over used, but after reading the first two books in the \\"Hunger Games\\" Trilogy, riveting fits the bill. At the halfway point, I can't wait to see how it ends.
0062060562|5.0|I couldn't disagree more with those who panned this book, saying it was not thrilling and you had to suspend disbelief to read it. I was up most of the night and only quit reading when I realized I only had 5 hours to sleep before a busy day.  I found it well written, and (mostly) believable. It kept me wondering until the last chapters who the bad guy was...Ben? or Dr. Ed? It also made me think how blessed I am to be able to remember who I am and to retain all my precious memories.
B0027MJU00|1.0|Fourth rate porn - juvenile. Nothing but heated kisses, hard nipples, etc. The characters were so hot and bothered all the time I don't know how they could function with everyday life. Boring. You asked, sorry.

B005RAO0GS|3.0|And I thought Lungs was ridiculous. This album along with Lungs are two of the loudest and most compressed (dynamic range) recording I have ever encountered. So loud in fact that you can easily hear the sound distorting on the peaks. I listen to vast variety of stuff and this is far worst than any rap, pop or rock recording I have ever heard. She makes beautiful and powerfully music but it is undermined by very poor engineering.  She should do herself a big favor and get new engineers for her next project. Wishful thinking based on the success of the two recordings, but one can always hope.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Incredible!  So many great characters with so much action and plenty of story line to keep us thinking.  Each of the mains had plenty of screen time and did their part.  Difficult to have to wait for the next installment.  I do wish the hopefully ongoing series will include some of the common and frequent members of the team.  The Pym couple (Wasp and her hubby) belong, and throwing in Scarlet Witch or some of the other female members to balance out the mostly male squad might be nice.
B0085BHHOS|5.0|the cd arrive in good state and in time, it was the same item in the image, and it acomplish everything i wanted,
B005LAIH5O|2.0|Though I did enjoy much of the action and the general look of the film, I was constantly telling myself \\"it's just a movie.\\"  Each time the story altered the mythology for the movie's sake was a distraction...and it was often.  I'm accustomed to the practice of combining characters and events to shorten a story to fit into a film's time frame.  But, this film (and it's sequel) went beyond saving time.  They couldn't even get Pegasus right.  Perhaps they should have taken a look at the Harry Hamlin film as a reference.  Pegasus is the name of a single flying horse, not a type of animal.  The writers must have been D&D players who also didn't know the difference. Next time I want to watch the story I'll watch the 1981 version.  It's fun with fewer distractions.
B0086700CM|5.0|just read the title it was complete fun hard but awesome  it was so addicting  i did not know what day it was
1582701709|5.0|A very good book. I recommend everyone to read this book. It will change your life. It is well known that the premise of \\"The Secret\\" is the science of attracting the things in life that you desire and need and in removing from your life those things that you don't want.
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|Simply put, what a beautiful film. The narrative is really quite seamless and well edited in my humble opinion. I actually didn't even notice that it was 2.5 hours long and probably could have watched fifteen minutes more. I think the director just made it at the wrong time. Great casting. Ms. Paquin. Period.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice game I like it and it is nice and I like it and I I I j I I i
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have read it 3 times and cannot get enough!  I love this book! I didn't think I could ever find a book that captivated me just as much as the 50 Shades books, but this was just as good and I was so happy to find something that kept me wanting more even after I finished the book.  Can't wait for Walking Disaster!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I had heard a lot about this book before purchasing it.  I found it interesting, but a bit tedious through the middle of the book; you just wanted it to move on.
0425263908|3.0|I would say this book is a good read, although be it very very simular to 50 Shades of Grey! I am obsessed with 50 Shades and when I heard about this book I was all too excited. Did it live up to the hype? No not quite, but Im not upset that I took the time to read it. I felt like the beginning of the story (Eva and Cross meeting and Falling for eachother) Happened too quickly. There wasnt a whole lot of build up. I think Cross' Charactor is pretty much Christian Grey with longer and darker hair. Eva on the other hand is much different from Ana,In a bad way if you ask me. I love how Ana was coy and shy and innocent, where as Eva is loud, blunt, and frankly has a sailors mouth! I would expect that from the domineering men in these books, but for her to be the same way was alittle much to handle for me. It was almost as if Cross and Eva had the same personallity, which took away from the dynamic of the book.<br /><br />I also agree with some of the previous reviews.Bared to You is basically 50 Shades with a twist on the heroine and alittle less kinky stuff! The way Eva fell in the lobby in front of Cross is almost the same as how Ana stumbled into Greys office. Take that added to the fact that they are both billionaires and both of the women dont care about the money they have and want to separate themselves with their own career.<br /><br />The end of the book didnt leave me hanging with anything....she could have ended it there and it would have been fine. I know there is more to know about Cross' past and Cary is going off the deep end, so there may be enough to continue with more books. I think Ill read the next one and go from there, but I am not even close to as excited to read these as I was with 50 Shades!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I had been wanting to read this book since it had first came out. I bought it as a kindle download to read on vacation. It did not disappoint! It is a beautifully written story that I was just plain sad to finish. I hope Ms. Morgenstern is busy writing her next book.
B008645YEE|3.0|If you have the score for the Dark Knight skip this one. The majority of the tracks derive from that one with very little on new content. The song played in the promotions is very short and not worth the purchase. I actually felt cheated with this purchase.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|What a great movie, and stunning acting performances.  One of the best pieces of moviemaking I have ever seen.  See it asap!
B00192IV0O|3.0|Over the years I've heard a lot about the Black Eyed Peas as well as snips of songs here and there.  I figured it was about time for me to check them out, and since I remember seeing this album all over the place, I figured it would be a good album to start with.  I've listened to it all the way through several times now, and while I don't find it to be a bad album, I don't find it particularly riveting either.  A lot of the songs are laced with effects and auto-tuning and just sounded rather generic.  Some of the songs are catchy but never really seem to go anywhere.  Based on some of the reviews I've seen here, perhaps I'll check out some of their previous albums.
0307592731|3.0|I finally bought this book because I had seen the name topping the Non-Fiction Best Seller list for so long that I thought it would be a lovely evocative story of hiking and camping on the Pacific Coast Trail, burnishing the memories I have of the times in the very late 1940s and the 1950s when my late wife and I would be packed in to Kings Canyon National Park to spend a week of our vacation  - first with friends and then much later with our children  - hiking and camping, isolated, beside a lake or a stream in the High Sierras. Those memorable moments in the high mountains are indescribable. The pure air, the absolute silence, the immensity, the trees, the breathtaking brilliance of the canopy of stars at night, the aloneness. No phones. No papers, no schedule, no people  - none - except your hiking and camping companions. Companionship around a campfire in the enfolding darkness before a night in your warm sleeping bag - and then a cold dawn, washing in cold, cold water, building the morning fire and the first cup of good hot coffee. Ah! I thought I might relive it all - or at least some delicious part of it - through Ms. Strayed's prose.<br /><br />  But it was not to be. This book is a carefully designed literary event. Yes, Ms. Strayed tells us about her two plus months in 1995 hiking the Pacific Coast Trail from Mohave in the Sierras through the Cascades and finally to the Bridge of The Gods over the Columbia at Portland. It's an agonizing hike - her boots were new, never broken in and too small, her pack was way too heavy; she was a tenderfoot in every way  - and if there is one consistent theme in this book it is how her feet - blistered, bleeding, bruised - hurt every hour of every day and night. She had absolutely no previous hiking or camping experience and she was hiking alone  - foolhardy and an absolute no-no. She was lucky to have made the trip and live to tell about it.<br /><br /> No, the hike is not the story; and having said that I'm not just sure what her story is if there is one. She was 22 when she made the hike and was or had been an insecure, live-for-the-moment girl, experimenting with drugs (heroin), men (many), marriage and life itself. Her home life had been unhappy and she had just experienced the tragic death of her mother at 50 from cancer as well as a new divorce from a husband she still loved (kind of). So there was every reason for her to go to the mountains to heal, to \\"find herself\\".<br /><br /> That's not the story either, but it's certainly a big - if not the larger  - part of it. Every few pages she careens off the trail of her hiking story to give us several more pages of flashback on her many problems in the life she had led, the problems  that finally brought her to the hike. As a matter of fact there are more pages about her troubles than her hike; and she never really appreciates the beauty of where she was. Frankly I'm a bit tired of writers telling us what a tough time they had growing up and how they were redeemed - or redeemed themselves - one way or another - their theory being, I guess, that the greater the troubles the louder we cheer the redemption. All of us have troubles - very often big troubles - but we find redemption in many different ways - through courage, through our friends, our family, professional help or the Church, or through the simple application of wisdom and the benefit of experience - in ways other than by shaking out our troubles in the black and white of print before the reading public. (It's a kind of self hero worship.) But then, too, most of us are not writers; and that is what writers such as Ms. Strayed like to do.<br /><br /> Which brings me to my problem with this book. Ms. Strayed made this trip in 1995; the book was published 17 years later - in 2012. But in her book she is telling us in minute-by-minute detail what happened during her long hours on the trail - or off it -  and like it happened yesterday. For example, she will tell us exactly what she ate, alone one night in her cold tent in the rain, and what she thought about as she ate- her mother's suicide, her old boyfriend etc. There are long passages - pages and pages of them - of retrospective personal detail, more of them in fact than pages of the details of her actual hike. No one could have kept a journal with so much detail for so long, given the conditions of her hike. Much of her story - if not the majority of it - is therefore fiction based on the memories of what she did 17 years before she put pen to paper - fiction unfortunately dressed up as truth; but such is her privilege because she is first and foremost a writer. She was bookish. She would read, not write. (By my count she read or referred to 14 books, only a few of which she picked up on the way.) She wrote more about the books she was reading than the glorious sights that surrounded her. After the trip she made her living writing for the 17 years that intervened between the trip and this book; and a writer enjoys a wide canvas on which to inscribe his or her thoughts; and she used absolutely all of it So the book is both fiction and non-fiction and memoir - a mélange of all of the above.<br /><br /> However, if you are going to read it, forget all this and read it for what it is - a literary event, neither fiction or non fiction, a book based on both truth and memory, written by an accomplished writer as a part of her work as a published author.<br /><br /> Believe me, it's a long slog; and when, like Ms. Strayed, I made it to the Bridge of the Gods with her I had had it. I don't want to do it again.
0765365278|4.0|After finishing the Mistborn Trilogy I found that I wanted to read more of Brandon Sanderson's work, so I decided to pick up The Way of Kings. I was a bit hesitant, seeing as it is the first book of a long series that will probably take decades to write since Mr. Sanderson has many projects. It was worth it.<br /><br />As others have said, Brandon Sanderson is a master of world building, particularly when it comes to creating interesting magic systems and diverse ecological environments. The Way of Kings is no exception, I found myself loving the world this series takes place in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found that I did not enjoy several of the PoV characters in the beginning. Several characters just appeared dense and seemed to be indecisive. It reminded of Vin or Elend in book 2 of Mistborn or Sazed in book 3. Fortunately, they did improve in my humble opinion.<br /><br />At this point, I would've rated the book a 3, however the ending was so satisfying that I had to bump it up to a 4. I think I've reread the last 100 pages of the book a good three to four times.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its free very basic very easy to use big display only &quot;complaint&quot; if you wanna call it that is not square roots that would make it 6 out of 5 haha 5 stars
B0085Z3B2Q|1.0|We just got this, and my daughter was all excited to watch it, but the darn thing can't load.  Oh, and how do I know it's Universal that did this to me?  Because all we've seen on our screen for the past 10 minutes is little spinning globe universal logo.  And the worst part is, Universal has done this to me before.  We have the same problem with our Despicable Me blu ray, again with the spinning logo.<br /><br />These are the only two blu rays we've ever had a problem with.  We keep our blu ray player updated, and we have movies from several different studios, but the Universal ones are the only ones that don't seem to work.  I don't know if they're just loading it down with \\"bonus\\" junk or what, but it's not working, so please stop and just let us enjoy the darn movie.

B0067Q04AM|5.0|This CD is so awsome and has so many other artists included with Robert Glasper.  This CD has a sound of it's very own.  A must buy.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I really wanted to like this book, but was absolutely bored.  After reading the great reviews, and there were many, I was certain this was an extraordinary story, but I struggled to get through it.  Sorry to all the fans, but I did not enjoy this story whatsoever.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Amazing book!! Loved it I have already read this book 3 times since I bought it!!!! Trust me on this everyone should read this book. It will make a great movie also.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|We rented Ghost Protocol because we loved the other MI movies expecting a movie of the same quality as the others and were not disappointed. We found the movie to have a good plot and full of action. It is exactly what we expected going into the movie. Tom Cruise and company delivered a quality movie that is definitely worth the rent if you are a fan of the action thriller genre.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|Good quality concert on both the 1st night (when it poured) as well as the 2nd night and come interesting comments from the director. Ross was at her height then and handled the crowd very well. Sort of dramatic and very entertaining.
B007HJ91HU|2.0|We rented the movie because we loved the original when it came out, and were extremely disappointed to find that it was a mediocre remake of the original 80's classic. The acting was stiff, the dancing was ho-hum and the character seemed to be trying to play the original actors playing the characters. The movie missed a great opportunity to refresh a classic 80's movie and reinvigorate it for the next generation and instead left you with the impression that it was directed by a bunch of high school students. I am glad we only rented it.
031620157X|5.0|First Sentence: The dungeon was a miserable place.<br /><br />A Quick Synopsis: On Conner and Alex's twelfth birthday, their grandma gives them a most special gift: her fairy-tale book, called The Land of Stories. But they have no idea just how special this book is, until one day, they find out this book can take them to a place called the Land of Stories, where fairy tales  are reality! And all their favorite fairy tale characters are here--including Snow White, Rapunzel, Cinderella, and the like. But not everything's perfect, and the twins are soon hunted by a dangerous queen. How are they to get back to our world?<br /><br />The Review: When I placed a reserve on this book at my local library, I had no idea who Chris Colfer was. Honest to goodness! And of course, since I didn't know who Chris Colfer was, I had no idea why the book was generating so much buzz on Amazon. For those of you like me, who don't know who he is, Mr. Colfer is an actor, best known for his role on Glee. As soon as I found this out, I'm ashamed to say that my expectations for this book dwindled greatly.<br /><br />But they really shouldn't have. Sure, lots of books written by celebrities have been sub-par lately (see The Fame Game by Lauren Conrad), but The Land of Stories is different.<br /><br />Here's why.<br /><br />1) The characters, specifically the main ones. Alex and Conner seem a bit stereotypical at first, but soon we see just how deep they are. Both are kids mature beyond their years who know how to deal with grief and loss. At one point their mother remarks they are even too young to expect to be disappointed. I just loved Alex and Conner so much.<br /><br />2) The humor. Wow, is this book funny! The twins are always comical, even in the face of danger. Cinderella has an amazing sense of humor. Conner is a natural-born jokester. The characters banter and bicker oh-so-enjoyably. You'll be smiling and laughing throughout the book as you read it.<br /><br />3) The fairy tale lore. Some fairy tale books (like [[ASIN:0547645708 Enchanted]]) seem to just try and stuff as many fairy tale references as they can into the plot. Not this one. Everything fits so well, and Mr. Colfer, while using all the fairy tale characters we love, manages to build upon them! This book was very well-plotted with all its fairy tales and such, which brings me to<br /><br />4) The plot. Good golly did I love it. It is imaginative, wacky, and fantastical. This book is filled with twists and turns until the very last chapter. I'm serious; just when you think everything is settled, Chris Colfer throws in an awesome twist that you never saw coming!<br /><br />5) The depth of the story. At first glance, the book just seems like an everyday middle-grade fantasy adventure. But that's not all. There are themes such as loss and moving on, hiding and being an outcast scattered throughout the book. And Colfer's characters are not as good and evil, not as black and white as you may first think they are. This makes the book enjoyable for older as well as younger readers.<br /><br />6) Lastly, the action and suspense. I may be cheating with this one since I put down Plot already, but I just could not stop reading this book! It is over 400 pages, yet I read it in two sittings. Mr. Colfer ends his chapters deviously with cliffhangers and suspense so that you must keep reading. There is a surplus of action, with hungry wolves, evil trolls, and castle battles.<br /><br />The Land of Stories has all the humor that a Rick Riordan book does, has all the action and adventure that Brandon Mull's [[ASIN:1416997938 A World Without Heroes (Beyonders)]] does, and to top it off, has all the magic of your favorite fairy tales. If you know any kid in middle or elementary school that likes any of the three, this'll make a great gift for them--especially with Brandon Dorman's beautiful cover and interior art, including a full-color map inside! Is this book amazingly original? No. Is this book destinedto be a classic? No. But this book is so much more than another book written by a celebrity, and is so much more than just another fairy tale rehash. It made me wish it could have been released just a few years earlier, back when I was in elementary school. And it is, without a doubt, one of my favorite fantasy reads of 2012 so far.<br /><br />Memorable Quote:<br />\\"Your story will be forever be romanticized. No one will ever think twice about mine.

0143121006|5.0|Downloaded this after reading the Economist's review.  Very good, highly readable book.  French takes a stylistic liberties througout, but I think this reflects that more than anything else this is at first glance -- as he notes in the afterword -- \\"a great tale\\" (albeit a very horrific and sad one).  Great glimpse into 20th century Chinese history, makes me want to learn more about that time and part of the world.  French's conclusion is plausible, but I'm not sure truly \\"conclusive\\" of the matter -- the slight emotional let down upon finishing the book however helped me empathize with all its tragic characters.  I don't think I could ask for more out of this kind of book; I highly recommend it.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Amazing workout for only 20 mins a day!! You WILL sweat and you WILL burn!!! Definitely worth it!! Buy buy buy!!!

Now be a good girl and if you are lucky I might give you a spank later.<br />golly gosh, though Anastasia while subconsciously biting her lower lip, Christian Grey really is very hot and it is so handy that he is only 27 and a billionaire to boot.<br /><br />repete ad nauseam.
0345803485|2.0|I just finished reading all 3 books.  In my opinion the first book was the best which I'm using the term best loosely.  I wasn't sure what all the hype was for,its a standard romance novel.  The concepts aren't new and I've read better romance trilogies.  It's definetly not a great piece of literature but its a quick and fun read as long as you take it with a grain of salt.  Yes Mr. Grey is a billionaire, flys his own plane, etc but that part doesn't bother me, its a romance novel.<br />I had a couple of issues though: First Ana is annoying.  She is suppose to be a strong character but she doesn't come across like that.  She comes across as a typical teenager(she's suppose to be in her 20's) who is insecure, who overanalyzes everything way too much, and who doesn't have a clue about life.<br />Second I feel this book is actually doing a disservice to the BDSM community.  From what I know, just because someone is into BDSM, doesn't mean they have a traumatic past.  Its simply another thing that turns some people on, no different than any other sexual activity. And in true BDSM, the submissive gets as much pleasure as the dominant.  I feel it was portrayed badly, but again its a romance novel.<br />My pet peeve with the actual writing was the constant emails, it struck me as filler.  I think the book could have been condensed into 2 if you eliminated all the emails, all the inner goddess talk, and half the sex scenes.  There is a sex scene every other page and while it didn't bother me, it tends to lose its novelty, I found myself skipping some scenes.<br />Just take it for what it is, a very light reading, a romance novel with miminal plot and heavy on sex.  Don't over analyze it, don't expect a great piece of literature and its fine.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is so fun! Can't stop! My kids love it too. Great for killing time at the doctor's office etc. I like it because they are short games so you don't have to spend a lot of time.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Ok, what can I say? Muse is a Great Band. Every album they do is awesome. I reccomend this album a lot.
034580404X|5.0|Be prepared to have reading time set aside!  The Fifty Shades trilogy hooks you and reels you in. Christian Grey's character is intriguing and sexy...and keeps you turning the pages.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is the kind of story that makes you rethink how you live your life.  Adam Brown was an amazing person and though his live demonstrated that many of our limits are self imposed.<br /><br />Quick, interesting read with value to everyday life.  I highly recommend this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book and all of the twists however I am upset that the books just ends. The author writes a good story and entices you to continue reading but the ending of the book should have been different.
B007NWCZR4|5.0|The Boys once again showcase the breadth of their talent with this collection that spans over a decade. There are many treasures here and realizing that these are the b-sides just enhances the amazement. Don't pass this up!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great app. great job smart software people. the buttons are big and easy to use. I highly. recommend this app.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Every time there's an update now, all game progress is erased. Love the game, but not enough to start over whenever an update comes along. Don't recall this being an issue before.
B006MW3V6U|2.0|I very much enjoyed this season of Downton Abbey.  My low rating has to do with the difficulty in connection and control of this purchase.  I interfaced with the Amazon site both directly with my PC and indirectly with my Roku box and both options proved incredibly difficlut.  The Roku box lost total control of the movie play features and the PC lost partial control.  This is not an issue when connecting with other movie providing sites.  Either their instructions for how to make this work are insufficient or the response from the Amazon site is poor.
1400049628|4.0|A great book that provides some basic survival knowledge as well as a fun \\"What if\\" scenario, the so called \\"true stories\\" are pretty corny but overall as a fan of zombie culture i was happy with it.
B008A5TL2U|5.0|I received this product for a great price very quickly in the mail, still wrapped in the original plastic. I was extremely pleased!
034580404X|5.0|this is very awesome it it arrive in very good time and it was a very good price for 3 books i will order more from them.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Totally enjoyed this work - a very well written and enjoyable yarn.  Highly recommend this work.  Look forward to more from this author.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is great fun that will keep you entertained. Everyone should play and enjoy time alone. Great for when you just got some time to waste.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is a story about coming to terms with what we THINK we want and need, versus what we really want and need. From the first paragraph I was hooked. The characters came alive for me, and for the first time in a long time I actually \\"lived\\" in a book for a while!
B006LEHOL2|5.0|Another original, bold, honest, creative piece of work from a living legend. Almost every track is a stand out. Great to see Sinead, Sophie B. Hawkins Tori Amos and Sarah Mclachlan are still putting out great work.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|Shazam is a great app for my Android Motorola phone. This is especially good for those of us who hear a song on the radio or from a DJ but can't remember the wording. A few new functions could be very handy - ability to recognize a song performed by a live cover band (yes, I realize the difficulty programming this), links for words, musical score, mp3 downloads, etc.
B00723NWJE|4.0|When I first heard about this record, I must admit I was scared that Norah might be selling out however after the first listen my fears were dismissed. She just keeps exploring new ground, all of her albums sound different, she is a true artists who explores new ground. Yet another great album from Ms. Jones
B008CWD17M|3.0|This is the Asia album, I wanted to hear 20 years ago. Unfortunately, so much time has passed, that I am just not in to them like I used to be. My failed attempts to connect with John Payne's Asia probably didn't help. Having said all that, the quality of Asia XXX is top notch, and the band has never sounded better. If you still love 'em, you will love this album.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|Amy Winehouse like a twenty first century Billie Holiday, she had a voice that was not only filled with sorrow and joy but also truth. There is something very real bout her. She lived the songs she sung. This cd is great and shows how diverse she is. R.I.P Amy.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this  game it is so fun and addicting it works great on my kindle fire hope that whoever download's this game next will like it as much as I did.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|I really really enjoyed this album, some great songs nothing mind blowing but a solid album, i would highly recommend it
B008CP92ZO|1.0|This is the worst movie I have seen. I was about to throw the TV out the window. Dont waste your money on it. Wait until its on TNT!
B005MYWZIO|5.0|This is a cracking first album by Mr. Kiwanuka, they are many highlights here, there is something about his style that reminds me of Otis Redding. This is for anyone who loves Real music
B000WCDBKM|4.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely. It kept my interest the entire time. I did not fall asleep, which I usually do if a movie is not holding my attention.
B008KW43TE|5.0|Usually I stick to classical (Bach, Vivaldi, Telemann, Mozart) and music from this century (Metric, Garbage, A Fine Frenzy) and occasional classics like the Pixies, Natalie Merchant, and I can listen to anything.  So far, jazz, rap, hip-hop haven't been anything I've listened to regularly.  So why did it only take a few listens to buy? I don't know.  I listen to this when I'm in a Bob Marley or Telemann kind of mood and it works. Really, really well.
B0032KPE0G|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. I found this movie to be extremely humorous. It reminded me of some of the things I have seen in my life.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great and very easy to use.  I like the large size and the traditional calculator symbols. I would recommend this app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three of the series. It had a wonderful story line excitment and suspense. Anna really held the heart of christian.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game In my opinion this is one of my favorite games that I had ever played in the whole wide world this game rocks
B003L77G38|5.0|They really stepped it up a notch with this season.  Alot of un-expectant turns and alot of questions from season two were answered.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I needed a calculator to do some simple math for work that I brought home and like to do while relaxing in my recliner.  This one fits the bill perfectly.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|The story completely lacks plausibility; simply put--they take liberties that invalidate the basic premise so the rest of the action is baseless/meaningless/pointless.  I love many flicks that others rebview poorly purely for the entertainment value, visual effects, acting, drama, horror, scifi, supernatural, etc. but this was absolute garbage from 5 minutes in.  If I could give it zero stars, I would have!  Anyone involved in its production (or at least those that made the decisions) should be ashamed...
B005HSL626|3.0|Although this is a fun game it was way too fast for my fingers.  But I gave it a try anyway.  Here's a tip:  our 7 year old granddaughter just loves to play it, and of course her fingers are faster.
0307279189|5.0|I've read this book 6 months ago and it inspired me to try barefoot running and minimalistic shoes. Since then, my technique and performance have improved, and my mileage has gone from 20+km to 50km a week.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented how this book has lots of hyperbole and slightly erratic story lines, that's all true, but the book is also a page turner, very inspirational, and the underlying message rings true: our bodies are naturally designed for barefoot or near-barefoot long-distance running. That doesn't mean you should kick your shoes off, well, I didn't, it means you slowly include barefoot running in your training to improve your technique and strengthen your body.<br /><br />During these 6 months I added small barefoot runs at the end of my long/tempo runs, up to 3x10 minutes a week, as you can see you don't have to do much to see improvements. I also slowly transitioned to the minimalistic shoes with lower drops, going from 20mm (standard shoes are 12mm, and I had gel inserts to avoid Achilles problems) down to 4mm, and will hopefully go down to the zero. \\"Slowly\\" is the word here, you have to give your body chance to adapt.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to runners who believe in listening to their body and letting it run in inhibit and natural style.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is always a popular favorite and has been mine for years.  I do like some of the nice features associated with this game, no dragging and dropping.  Nice touch.
0060987464|5.0|Love how he takes you into his families dark secrets, and how he thought about them. This book is really good especially, for the MM fan. He tells many details, and not for the faint hearted!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is one of my most favorite card games.  I love that it has different skill levels to challenge the player.  Of course I am still one of the middle level players.  But it really builds your skills of observation so you don't miss a good play.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This is a fun game that helps pass the time. Can stop &amp; start@any time. You can choose your own level of difficulty.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Get this app right now&hellip; so addicting love it oh and rate it 5 stars or it will bother you. XD
B005LAIH54|4.0|A fast paced romp showcasing some of the most debated characters in mystical/religious genre.  Seeing these characters brought to life with modern CG magic makes this a definite must-see for any sci-fi fan.  I'm sure I'll watch it again as the lightning fast pace results in missing some of the smaller details that you want to see again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|get this app!!! . plenty of great features good for any age. or any translation. God bless. praise Jesus. rock on.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This is the best movie EVER. Totally awesome would recomend to EVERYONE. By far the best Avenger movie. CAPTAIN AAMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1401310923|5.0|I absolutly LOVED the book, the minute I received it I could not stp reading !!! It's a must have!!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I had goosebumps throughout most of this movie.  The graphics were amazing, and sometimes funny, if you caught the fact that alient \\"bombs\\" were shaped like the game pieces (pegs) from the old boardgame.  Great acting, great story line, no empty space.  It was very refreshing to see a movie that combined good actors, a great story, and made a great salute to our military.  I can't wait to watch it again!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the way this book was written.  It is refreshing and a fun read!  I did not expect the ending and I enjoyed the characters very much.  I did not have any expectations for this book and it went far beyond what I thought.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Love listening to the whining kindle fire lamers. Boo hoo...you have to spend 1.99 for a great game. Get over yourselves. 5 out of 5
B008CRC506|5.0|I watched Season 1 over a week-end while visiting my actress daughter, and was completely captivated. Of course I knew that hers is a dirty, cut-throat business, but this series made the whole theatrical world more real to me (I am a teacher in a rural school) and increased my respect for 'those who hope' a thousand-fold. I cheerfully ignored the over-the-top aspects of the plot, and reveled in the wonderful original score and the performances by some of Broadway's best. Christian Borle is fabulous (is it he who sings Porter's \\"Another Openin,'\\" and if so why, in the name of all that's holy, is that not available on iTunes?), and Megan Hilsey fills the Marilyn bill, in my book. La Houston is a credit to her father and to the profession. BOCO product and Idol vet McFee does a great job in the vocal and dance components of her role; the fact that she is an acting neophyte shouldn't be held against  her - for this first season. I look forward to Season 2 in the hope that the music and dancing continue to ameliorate a sometimes silly plot, and in the hope that this show will avoid some of the pitfalls (30 year-old teenagers, ridiculous faculty behavior) that made \\"Glee\\" such a let-down in its subsequent seasons. Regardless, Season 1 is worth watching.

B005RUV0NY|5.0|A great second season from a great series. It's not like the comics at all but what would be the point in that? Watch the show, read the comics, and enjoy it all!
B000ID37KO|4.0|This little thriller by Hitchcock still holds up  pretty well even after circa 50 years.  Good script, direction, and camera work.  Decent acting.  No...it isn't Gone With the Wind, Forrest Gump, or Jaws.  If you approach this work with expectations like that, you will be disappointed.<br />  If you can accept the seeming improbability of out-of-the-blue, coordinated attacks by huge mixed masses of murderous avian kamikazes, you will probably enjoy this old video.<br />  If you can't-or, if sci-fi/fantasy just isn't your thing, you probably won't. I usually like to give any speculative fiction writer, novelist, or scriptwriter at least one big improbability per story. One disbelief-suspending \\"what-if?\\" scenario.  As long as it isn't too off-the-wall, I'll go along. In this case I believe the concession was worth the effort.
B007TB5WE2|4.0|If the author had taken the trouble to combine the two halves of the reportage, it could have become a really good fiction thriller, revealing more about the human condition than a reportage could. But a fascinating read all the same, showing the human foibles beneath a carefully maintained superior colonial facade.

B008ER9QKG|1.0|Given how many excellent sets of DVDs are available of Wagner's protean Ring cycle, the person who buys this particular set must have money and hours to burn.  While parts of this production are truly wonderful, most of it is truly appalling. I need only remind those who have seen this on HD simulcast of the dragon in Siegfried. Do we really need Kukla of Kukla Fran and Ollie at this moment? Again, think of the scene with the Norns at the beginning of Gotterdammerung.  Does anybody have any idea what is going on or what is being sung? Who are these women? And what have they done with the Norns?<br /><br />Many of the voices are terrific, such as Jonas Kauffmann's Siegmund, but Eva Marie Westbroek's Sieglinde does not match it in vocal beauty. Deborah Voigt's Brunhilde is ragged and strained.  Bryn Terfel sings and acts a fervent Wotan, but his voice is a little light.  On the other hand, Stephanie Blythe's Fricka might just be worth the price of the set.<br /><br />The staging can be stunning, as in Jay Hunter Morris's thrilling traverse of the magic fire in Siegfried.  Too, Wotan and Loge's descent in to Nibelheim is the highlight of the entire production. But the scene in Gotterdammerung when Siegfried breaks Wotan's spear is absolutely baffling.  What on earth is going on?<br /><br />I could go on and on.  think very long and hard about purchasing this item.  I wouldn't.  I have the Levine Ring designed by Otto Schenk and Gunther Schneider Siemssen, a very traditional set with the sublime James Morris as Wotan.  There are other better sets even than this, but it is a safe bet.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Everyone has something to say about these Sherlock Holmes movies and whether they enhance, desecrate or revitalize the Holmes legend but it's all a matter of opinion. Personally, I admit I haven't read a Holmes novel but I find the character interesting and Downey Jr. is addictive to watch as he plays the strange genius. It's funny, action-packed, eye-candy with interesting characters and a story that makes sense so there's my case. Meanwhile, film buffs who dig things like commentaries get to watch a unique feature that's part making-of documentary and part commentary as Guy Ritchie visually walks you through the movie. And if you love commentaries but don't like the movie? Well this commentary may at least make you appreciate what went into the movie.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I purchased this camera bag for my new Nikon D5100, 18-55mm, 55-300mm and 50mm lenses, plus charger, remote, etc.  It's light, nicely padded and flexible enough to handle my equipment.  I keep it packed and ready to go.  The extra compartments are very useful for cell phone, keys, etc. I can sling this bag over one shoulder.  It seems well constructed. I have no substantive complaints. but, if you have much more equipment than I do, you will want a larger bag.  This one is perfect for me.

1439170916|5.0|The subtitle for Mukherjee's book, \\"A Biography of Cancer\\" is meant to be mildly provocative while containing the kernal of truth - this book is truly a \\"biography,\\" not a \\"history\\" of cancer.  As a cancer researcher and clinical physician, the author is in an ideal situation to make this observation: all those involved in cancer come to think of the disease not just as living cells subdividing, but as a malignant presence in the body.  An invader, hijacking the body's natural processes for its own nefarious purposes.  At various times, the author uses words like \\"demented\\" and even \\"beautiful\\" to describe cancer.  Both terms anthropomophise the disease - the latter term is provocative, he uses it to reinforce the idea that the cancer cell is actually a perfect, immortal cellular machine: it grows quickly, forever.<br /><br />All those touched by the disease (which, statistically, is just about everybody) will have some experience with the clinical/medical side of cancer, whether as patient, survivor, or as the support person/family member of someone with cancer.  What will be less familiar is the epic struggle going on between researchers and this adaptive and ruthless disease.  The beauty of Mukherjee's book is that it traces all aspects of the trajectory of cancer through the life of human society and through the life of individual patients with the disease.  It is at various times witty, heartbreaking and strident, but it is always engaging.  The author's style is, on the surface, chaotic: he jumps around from time to time and place to place, interspersing personal stories of his own cancer patients.  The most inspiring stories are, of course the cured patients: in those cases he usually follows the specific type of cancer the patient has, from its first description through to a therapy that finally cures the cancer (in some cases, the \\"cure\\" is actually just a long-term remission, i.e. if the patient stopped taking a drug, the cancer would return).  He very touchingly recounts his own personal nervousness and excitement at meeting one of the first people to be cured of childhood leukemia by chemotherapy - one might have thought he was meeting the Queen of England or a favourite sports star!  Using such patient stories as a backdrop, the book chronicles the progress of cancer research, and indeed one could argue, the progress of cell and molecular biology research in general.  This is because cancer not really a systemic disease, but a disease of cell-replicating molecules (i.e., DNA, retroviruses, etc.) and understanding the current treatment of cancer and its pharmaceutical weapons requires understanding the mechanism of cell division.  That's not to say that this is a dry scientific treatise, even in the most scientific parts the book is exciting and builds slowly to the current understanding of the disease, even as the researchers involved slowly came to understand the disease over hundreds of years.<br /><br />The above description does not adequately describe how readable and engrossing the book is.  Mukherjee has a strong sense of history, at times tying in AIDS, the Manhattan Project, the Boston Braves (and later the Red Sox), \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\\" New York socialites, the March of Dimes, Big Tobacco, and even an Egyptian queen (who had breast cancer). He is especially hard on doctors and scientists who fail to see the forest for the trees, for example, those who promoted grossly disfiguring radical masectomies when the evidence clearly pointed to the fact that they did not increase survival rates.  Another target is the cancer fundraising movement that felt the need to promise radical and systemic cures to cancer when the biology clearly pointed to the fact that such a promise could not be delivered (of course, they ended up getting the money, and continue to do so, so it didn't really harm them to oversimplify their message for politicians and the general public).<br /><br />Ultimately, the reason toread the book is that you'll be entertained and you'll learn a lot.  As I've mentioned a few times, the writing is engaging and even occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.  I'll leave you with two examples of descriptions of cancer researchers that represent the humour:  When describing a particularly skilled surgeon the author notes that he was also an excellent musician: \\"Surgery and music often go together because both depend on immediacy, precision, and opposable thumbs.\\"  Another researcher he descibes as having a monotonous speaking style, \\"He delivered the most exciting results in oncology research as if reading the Soviet evening news.\\"
0345803493|5.0|I absolutely love these books. I was also impressed with how quickly I received this book. Already ordered the 3rd one!!
B004SEUJNM|5.0|My review once again is not to rehash the story, for we all know it's one of the greatest underdog stories of our time, and you wouldn't be reading this unless you were familiar with it.  The funny thing is a movie like this would never be a hit now, for there was too little violence, and it was mostly about one man overcoming several obstacles to get a shot at being respectable.  Stallone plays this to perfection, with him experiencing this in his own professional career as an actor, and he gives a realism that can only come from life experience.  This is why Stallone can't recapture this moment because once you've been to the mountain its a harder act to pretend to be hungry enough to climb back, (Although Rocky 2 was decent).  The thing that makes the story so strong was its supporting cast, and the movie world recognized this for they have reused these characters in many different venues to support their hero in whatever genre they were placed.<br />My review is for the blu ray book version that was released to say that it is worth the money for the collectible end of it, the overview by Richard Tanne was good, as well as the Final Fight essay in the back, plus the pictures were good.  As far as the picture itself, I agree with previous reviewers of the blu ray version, its a bit grainy at times, and the stock footage appears phony when you see it, but this is all limitations of the era of when this film was made and the film they used.  As for the sound being tinny at times, and I'm not sure but I was told that at the time this was made they produced the sound the same way they did tv, with a mono setting so it would sound flat in our home theatre setting.  If anyone knows about the sound I would be interested to know if that was true, cause I was always told that they did this, because in the seventies very few of the movie theaters weren't set up for stereo.  This was a nice gift from the family when I received it and I would recommend the book version for all of us completist who loved this movie.
B007PVHANM|3.0|I fear I am being kind giving this movie three stars; it is really too long and a bit of travesty. First, what is good about the movie--it has SOME (but no where near enough) concert footage and some great interviews with Bunny Wailer and even a short interview with Lee Scratch Perry. And what is both good and bad about the movie--it has a way too short interview with Familyman Barrett, which is good and leaves one wanting more. It was also fun to see Marley's kids all grown and Rita Marley.<br /><br />But you could have bottled the good stuff and had a movie half the length. (I wouldn't have been bothered if they had stretched out the movie to the same length with concert footage--in fact, that movie would have been a 5 star movie in my opinion.)<br /><br />What was wrong with the movie:<br /><br />1) WAYYYY to many interviews with Bob Marley's white male cousin (brother?) who played no real role in his actual life. Boring and irrelevant.<br /><br />2) WAYYYY too many interviews with the ex-Miss Universe that Marley had a fling with the in 1979s, Cindy Breakspeare (I think I got the name right). She is also white; so Marley liked a pretty woman? He must have slept with hundreds (AT LEAST!) and there is no particular reason to bore me with one.<br /><br />3) And this is most important--Chris Blackwell--who is a vampire [[ASIN:B004ZNJ5XG Judgement In A Babylon]] chose to market Bob Marley and the Wailers as a solo act (not as the Wailers, which is how they were viewed in Jamaica). This may have been a factor in the break up of the Wailers, which is a crime. IT also creates an historical inaccuracy--that Bob Marley is some strange unique musical genius. Blackwell knew better and he also knew he couldn't market the whole genre reggae to white rock fans--so he didn't try very hard. Thus the movie basically ignores the wider world of Jamaican music to try and sell the lie of the unique Robert Nesta Marley. I really missed Bunny Wailer in the movie after the Wailers broke up and kept wondering about Peter Tosh--and they were Marley's brothers! (Wailer quite literally)<br /><br />When I left the theatre, I discussed the movie with the popcorn seller. He looked a bit embarrassed to admit it, as he is a hip young white dude, but he said he thought maybe Marley wasn't interesting enough to support a movie that long. That is not quite the problem--by including so much material peripherial to WHO Marley was and WHAT it meant to be an international Rastafarian superstar--the movie actually manages to drag many times.<br /><br />I personally would recommend against buying a DVD of this movie (though, as I noted, I haven't seen the DVD and if it is filled with all sorts of awesome concert footage they didn't include in the regular movie, I could be wrong); if you want to see it, I would upload it for a single viewing--I'd be vaguely surprised if you watched the whole thing if you weren't trapped in a theatre.up and kept wondering about Peter Tosh--and they were Marley's brothers!

B001QWBM62|5.0|I love this thing. Amazing audio with such a small product. It's fantastic. Also, using the recorder as an audio interface for recording vocals/instruments directly onto my laptop works very well. Love it. My only complaint with it is the battery door. The little hook broke off the first time I closed the thing. Just throw a little gaff tape on there and it's fine.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I could be the mother of the main characters, and that is how I took it. But I surely have been as young as they are, and found it endearing to go back in time with them. And it is well written, unlike many of the best sellers around. The drugs and sex issues could present a problem in some families. Personally, I would recommend it to my young son, but unfortunately, he doesn´t like to read. Maybe he will watch the movie...
B007JWC8ZC|5.0|REVIEW UPDATE ALERT! PLEASE READ POSTED DATE: August 7, 2012 [[ASIN:B007JWC8ZC Full Metal Jacket 25th Anniversary (Blu-ray Book Packaging)]]<br /><br />Look at the dates of the other reviews, this release only came out on August 7, 2012 any review dated before that is probably an older transfer!<br /><br />This version sports a nice bunch of extras like Stanley Kubrick's Boxes (SD, 61 minutes), Between Good and Evil (SD, 31 minutes) & the theatrical trailer (SD, 2 minutes) and a great new visual remaster with high quality multi-version audio tracks (audio is the same as the 2007 release but that was already a great lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 and a uncompressed PCM 5.1 surround track) and a new audio commentary overlay track.<br /><br />So check the dates of the reviews and make sure that your going for the correct one before you buy!<br /><br />What can I say, this really is a new remaster for Full Metal Jacket that looks better than any other Kubrick remaster to date! Its crisp and rich in depth, I'm never seen a better Kubrick disc  version of the film (the soundtrack is the great multi-version tracks from 2007 as well so its perfect! The custom music, the haunting phone ringing and busy signal really pop!). Add to this the documentary Stanley Kubrick's Boxes that Kubrick nutz' like myself have been waiting for over four years to come to disc, this is the version of Full Metal Jacket you want to own; trust me!

B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is such a great game. It is not so easy as sequence of events move the story along. The music is so good it would be great as an app for relaxation. This game is well worth buying. Much better than other mystery games. It is just fun and relaxing.

B00170GXQ2|1.0|I read the book and loved it. I loved the characters and the plot and the ending. I did NOT enjoy this movie. If you want an accurate film adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, TURN AWAY!!! This is not the movie you're looking for... This is basically soft, bloody, pornography piggybacking on the title of a great turn of the century piece of art.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|Does what it's supposed to.<br /><br />It's a modest case that offers decent protection while still being aesthetically pleasing. The screen protector is a nice inclusion and goes on very easily.<br /><br />My only criticisms are that:<br />- Edges are stiff and \\"sharp;\\" they obviously don't cut, but it's definitely not as comfortable as cases with rounded edges.<br />- Difficult to put on or take off; while flexible, it's still a bit rigid, which makes it difficult for the iPhone to get in or out. Until I learned a good technique, I felt like I had to \\"manhandle\\" my phone into it.<br /><br />All in all, very good, especially for the price.<br /><br />Recommended!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can I say?  This book was a good read.  At first I wasn't sure about it, but realized it is not porn.  I feel it is most womens dream to be able to talk and do all the sexual things we want, but are to shy to mention to our partner.  It got a bit repetative at certain points, but you have to read throught those parts.  Once you get to the 3rd book it all pulls together.
0307957934|3.0|I enjoyed everything about this book except for the ending.  But I still recommend the book for any thriller/mystery fan who is interested in the inner workings of the modern day stock market (with all of its modern day problems).  It will give you a new appreciation of the issues the SEC and other market regulators will have to work through in order to avoid another flash crash.  Hopefully they are up to the task.

B008KP2VZY|5.0|I use this to sync my photos to my home server via FTP every night. Never had a problem. You can easily set different folders to sync to different locations, and using different connection methods. You can set it to only run if you're on a certain Wi-Fi network, so if it doesn't see my home SSID it doesn't try to sync to my local server. Lots of other smart features.

B000A7S4B0|5.0|IMPORTANT: I had originally purhcased this album upon its release, and sadly, it was lost during my cross-country move. Still 5 years later I found myself humming tunes pulled from the edges of my memory. An album long lost from my possesion became a clawing obsession, until I finally realized the source: HOWL!<br /><br />With driving melodic tracks and a few nitty gritty numbers, \\"HOWL\\" appeases the soul. Don't expect to find any long solos or hard power-chord derived riffs, instead you'll find a soundtrack that will haunt you with its cathcy meoldies and tell a new story with each track. Each song will find its way into your mind, and make a happy home. Enjoy!

Its a nice feature for someone like myself (freelance designer) who takes many notes on the laptop, desktop, tablet, and phone.<br /><br />This app allows you to record video, pictures, and even audio notes! The permissions for those features are NOT to spy on you, it is the business being transparent that the app needs YOUR permission to enable those features.<br /><br />What would they possibly track? Are you so special that evernote wants to record your blank face as it enters notes or to capture audio of you breathing?<br /><br />Anyone who is capable of understanding modern technology will love this app, however if you are spooked by giving up your email to a company on the misconception that evernote has an evil conspiracy against you, don't bother wiyh this app and don't write misleading reviews.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I'd heard a few songs of theirs on a Pandora station and was intrigued.  I am SO happy I bought this album.  It's really a great piece of work and now I'm really excited about their new album coming out in September.

B00005QGAT|5.0|Michael Jackson proved to be something special with \\"Off The Wall. Besides showing the world that he was more than a teenybopper performer, he showed the world that he an EXCELLENT artist. It was more than just a decent attempt to break out of the teen mold.<br /><br />The album throughout is extremely well-produced and always showcased Jackson's talents. Quincy Jones brought out the best in Michael Jackson, and vice-versa. The delivery, mannerisms, texture and falsetto of Jackson's singing and voice were amazing. The lyrics were always lighthearted, but always classy, sophisticated, and (mostly) not cheesy. Even though it was released 33 years ago, it still sounds fresh.  Some say that this was Michael Jackson's best album.  I'd say all the albums released during his prime years as an artist are equally good.<br /><br />Michael was album was no one trick pony on this album. \\"Off The Wall\\" has elements of several music styles that were popular during the late 70s - disco, funk, MOR (soft rock), soul, and even jazz. It included upbeat dance songs and heartfelt ballads. It had the sound of both black pop and white pop.  Of the ten songs on the album, I'd say the strongest were \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\", \\"She's Out of My Life\\", \\"Rock With You\\", \\"Working Day and Night\\", and \\"I Can't Help It\\". \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\" is a disco number impossible not to dance to. \\"She's Out of My Life\\" is a pop-soul ballad where Michael singing is flawless, and Jackson displays his emotions throughout. \\"Rock With You\\" has an amazing chorus and effectively blends disco and funk. \\"I Can't Help It\\" was a jazz number that demonstrated that Jackson could have been a jazz vocalist if he wanted to.<br /><br />The only weak points of this album is \\"Girlfriend\\" and \\"It's The Falling In Love\\". \\"Girlfriend\\" (produced by Paul McCartney) was a hit song, but it was kind of cheesy.  \\"It's The Falling In Love\\" was nothing more than a decent pop-soul ballad.<br /><br />Young and old MJ fans, if this isn't in your collection, get it in your collection. Music fans in general, get it in your collection.if this isn't in your collection, get it in your collection. Music fans in general, get it in your collection.

0062082353|1.0|Well I have spent days thinking how to be kind on reviewing this book.  I can't. It sucked!!  I mean Big Time Sucked!!  Do you suppose Mr. Kyle has ever heard of Carlos Hathcock.  Bet not!<br /><br />Mr. Kyle attempts to be a \\"badass\\" but succeeds only in being a very bad writer.  I would classify Mr. Kyle as a cold hearted killer, not a sniper.  He didn't describe events only how \\"tough\\" SEALS were.  No doubt SEALS are tough however I would give Mr. Kyle a \\"sissy\\" rating.  GEEZ O FLIP!  What an ego.  He talks about Dick Couch in his book.  Now that was really bad taste on his part.<br /><br />Is this what SEALS do when they are washed out, given ultimatums and then take it out on us the readers.<br />Shame on you Mr. Kyle.  One of the worst reads ever!! I really want my money back. Really Mr. Kyle, a check from you would be just fine.  No, I take that back, I want cash!!
0307742997|5.0|Another great read by an excellent author, very adept with descriptions, dialogue,  and suspense of the mystery novel...high on my favorite author listing, hope he keeps writing many more
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I heard so much talk about this book being a number one best seller that I downloaded it to my kindle to take on holidays honestly it is utter garbage.I cant imagine what kind of sick people would consider this a good book.I read it only because I had nothing else and I also kept thinking it would improve.

1469984202|5.0|This is a wonderfully immersive set of stories. Very well written with some great characters. Hopefully the series will continue, and I am definitely recommending this to my friends.
B00123KEPK|5.0|If you want more detailed reviews of the first 4 of 6 cuts on this album, see [[ASIN:B001QU0756 Tales From Topographic Oceans]].  Those speak to the original version album that was commercially released in 1974.  This particular release is one remastered by Rhino Records and contains two alternate versions of 2 of the original vinyl album sides.<br /><br />I rate this five stars because I would rate the original as five stars as I'm an unabashed fan of it.  This version in remastering I think brings out aspects of the original that I didn't hear as clearly or at all in the original, but this is speaking to memories of the vinyl version that date from the original release and many repeated plays since, so take this with a grain of salt. ;-)<br /><br />What's new are two alternate versions of originals \\"Dance of the Dawn\\" and \\"Giants Under the Sun\\".  \\"Dance\\" features alternate voicing and instrumentation which, when compared to the original, provide an interesting variation if sometimes having a less-finished feel.  The same is true of \\"Giants\\", but it, in a extended middle section, wanders into a drum and keyboard variation unlike the original.  It is more abstract or discordant than the original -- some play in the studio if you will -- so your enjoyment will vary.  I'm a fan of both of these newly issued alternate versions as a source of good music and an insight into Yes creative processes of the time.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was GREAT! I will definetly read it again. The whole story was interesting and sexual at the same time. Hope there will be another book like this one soon.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|I'm biased on the Reacher series, I like them all. I hope Child keeps the Reacher series alive.  Disappointed in the Cruise selection to play Reacher in the movie.  THat does not make any sense to me.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|It's hard to believe that this is the first novel from Elizabeth Haynes.  It is so well written and exciting!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it! Great start to the ending of last book. Kept me wanting more! I couldn't love this series any more than I do! Can't wait for the next book!
1594744769|5.0|I bought this book at the store mainly because of it's name and the pictures. This was an awesome tale. I could not put the book down. I really loved the  pictures as well. The author has great imagination. I wish I knew if they were fully successful in their quest. [[ASIN:1594744769 Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]
034580404X|3.0|The story line is pretty good for a romance novel and its nice that its a trilogy and in the end is happily ever after. The manufacturing of the book was horrible! I take very good care of my books and these fell apart in multiple places. The binding fell apart and pages fell out. Plus the paper was really bad quality.
B004H51706|5.0|Very well made. Doors hood and tailgate open.<br />Great details!<br />High quality strong plastic.<br />Bought for myself as I have the real truck, but my daughter loves to play with it as well.<br />I would purchase other models from this company also.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to say, I don't ever put a lot of stock in the average Amazon review ratings for books, but with this book, I simply struck gold.  I've never reviewed a book before, but the fact that this book series was so affordable, combined with the fact that I felt the author did not take ANY shortcuts with this story, I was compelled to rate and review.  I can honestly say this is the best science fiction book I've ever read (and I've read a few, including Enders Game, what many consider to be the best ever).  Howey weaves (no pun intended, and I'm sure this was never used before) such an emotional, dark, imaginative universe of characters and themes I felt like I was living in a post apocalypic world.  I actually felt claustrophic reading this, but in a good way, in an excited sort of discovery that left me eager to jump further into the rabbit's hole.  I don't know what else to say, other than I'm so excited to have found such a great writer/storyteller who seems to care about the constant reader, and can't wait to read everything Hugh Howy has to offer!
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love Ellen and have enjoyed her other books, sometimes even falling out of my chair as I read her crazy humor.<br /><br /> This book was entertaining 75% of the time, but never incredibly hilarious, and 25% of it was just dull filler.It seemed like she was just writing to fill up the pages and wasn't really into it. I'm glad I bought it but wonder if I will spring for her next one.

B007TBZ63Y|1.0|this book is for goddamn fourth graders. i loved rick rioriden when i was ten but now i think these books are crap. the plot is great but it is written so stupidly with horrible desciptions and imagery. if yur in sixth grade or over then you should be reading a real book. not this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great fun wish I could get acorns faster though. cant wait to see what happens with the pirate ship. hope it happens soon.
B005LAIH54|5.0|if you liked the first,you will love this one,better story line,all the world seems older and wiser.<br />interseting story from start to finish
B007XF0X16|4.0|This movie is gd for the sound and picture quality , too bad the home screen is not gd enough . Overall it is well worth the price to buy .
B006B9TLT0|4.0|As much as I enjoy this live video, I prefer Taylor Swift's studio recordings more.  To put it simply, this recording has just too much screaming from the crowd.  The screaming takes away from the impact of the music.  You're watching an event instead of a musical concert.  Her lyrics can be quite deep in her songs, but they become rather buried in the craziness of the fanatic fans.  Taylor Swift has incredible talent, don't get me wrong - I'm a fan, but this concert footage is not so much about the music but the praising of Taylor Swift.  Does she deserve all that praise?  Sure, she's earned it, but Taylor Swift the musician/songwriter can be better appreciated with her studio recordings.  That's one man's opinion and I thought I'd share it.
B005KELW26|5.0|I purchased this cover for my kindle fire! i absolutely love the color, price and easiness of the cover! the kindle fits very well in the cover. It is not bulky like some covers i have looked at! this was perfect for me to take on vacation to pack in a carry on bag!
0525478817|5.0|As a mother who screens everything her 13-year-old daughter reads, I've always felt conflicted when I come across a book that is brilliantly written, brave and touching - but that which has in it certain actions that we, as a conservative family, would not otherwise condone under normal circumstances. In the case of some wonderful books, such as those by Sarah Dessen, I put them on hold for when said daughter is older, and more likely to encounter similar dilemmas. In the case of \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" by John Green, I cannot recommend the book highly enough. For those of us lucky enough to live a life in which the fact of death is a certainty but when death occurs is not, we can afford to be conservative, cautious and patient. What happens when, at 16, you *know* you're going to die? Perhaps the bravest among us would still choose to live a conservative, cautious, patient life. For those who choose to live life to the fullest they can, barring hurting someone or something else, surely we are no judge. This is a humbling book, and I am truly grateful it was written. Said daughter's review follows:<br /><br />\\"'The Fault in Our Stars' by John Green has to be one of the best books I have ever read yet, because I believe that the best books are the ones that make you want to go out and DO something, and this book made me want to cry my eyes out and at the same time march right up to God/Allah/Buddha/whoever and ask him: 'Why?'<br /><br />\\"Because really, that is the only question in life we can't answer. Why do people leave us? Why do we have cancer? Why can't we be happy?<br /><br />\\"Sixteen-year-old Hazel's life sucks. Then again, she has cancer in her lungs, so her life is probably going to be pretty short. But despite her parents worrying over her 24/7, and her friends abandoning her, and the fact that she has to go to some so-called 'Support Group', which really just makes everyone MORE miserable than they already are, Hazel is doing okay. Not great, not horribly - just okay.<br /><br />\\"And then she meets seventeen-year-old Augustus.<br /><br />\\"Augustus had bone cancer, and his old girlfriend died from cancer as well. But he is more alive than anyone Hazel's ever known - and they fall in love.<br /><br />\\"But Augustus has his own secrets, and sometimes the worst lies are the lies you tell to yourself.<br /><br />\\"Okay, I know I already said this, but I love this book. Love it, love it, love it.  Hazel is so funny and Augustus is so brave, and the whole entire book is just so sad and wonderful and bittersweet, and should totally be a classic. :-)<br /><br />\\"My favorite part though, would have to be a toss up between the ending and the beginning - in the beginning, Hazel hasn't met Augustus yet, and he hasn't shown her how to *live*. She was just existing. In the end, though, Hazel knows how to live, and she is living the best she can, and it hurts a LOT.<br /><br />\\"I would have to give the book five stars (duh) : two stars for the plot, two stars for the characters and one star for the writing.<br /><br />\\"Read. This. Book.\\"

B004SEUJKU|4.0|The blue ray transfer was as good as your going to get from this film. After reading and debating the pros and cons I bought it with the same expectations I'd have with any older disc. It satisfied me and the story is still quite clever given the time period of making films in the eighties. As usual Amazon has been promt with most of my orders.
B008DR2GD6|4.0|I found this movie to be funny, typical Eddie Murphy.  I feel  this is a movie you want to be entertained, I would watch it again.
B007MAETA8|4.0|Continuum this is not.  When I first listened to this CD, it was hard for me not to compare it to Continuum, which remains one of my all time favorite collections of music.  I hope John gets back to the Blues.<br /><br />BUT, I am glad that I bought this CD.  The more I listen to it, the more it grows on me, and the more I appreciate it on its own merits.  As always, John Mayer relates truths about life with lyrics that get your head nodding in agreement as you listen.  He describes these truths with such honesty, and you just want to shout out, \\"Me too!\\"  This CD is contemplative and mellow; it sends you to a place where you are by yourself, looking back on your life and pondering what you've learned from it, all the while looking to what's ahead.  Not all of the messages are happy ones, but they are real and palpable and so wonderfully reflect the texture and complexity of human existence.<br /><br />This CD gives you something to chew on, unlike a lot of the other compilations that are out there.  John Mayer has once again proven how talented he is.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is a must read if you want to hear the stories of an US Navy Seal sniper its great!!! I couldn't put it down and I hate reading!!!

The impact of solving it will have profound effects on him and the entire family.
B0087YPCYA|4.0|A lot of nudity may turn of some, but these movies are actually really entertaining. Some good laughs, and overall a fun movie.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I got this product on time and it was securely wrapped and in perfect condition! It has 3 music videos, Gotta Be You, One Thing, and What Makes You Beautiful.

I'm forever a Directioner and I will cherish this Tour DVD forever!!(:
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was quite a captivating book. Far more sexually erotic than I expected, but quite interesting. I could not wait to start the second book once I was done.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Before starting the series of books, I heard all of the ''hipe'' on T.V & Radio, I had co-workings reading them nonstop around me. So I thought what the heck I'll see what this is all about. I was for warned the first book did not get that interesting until around chapter 8, so I hung in there. That indeed is true. Intrigued by the first book I went on to the second, Interested in what would happen next I was on to this the final of the three.<br /><br />Though I did not like that the book picked up totally were you would have never imagined, I had to think harder as Ana recalls the missing links, I enjoyed were they end up. Not everyone will agree with me but I liked it over all. I fell in love with Christian with he's strange ways. Through these chapters you do begin to see him freed from his fear and insecurities of himself, life and true love, (There's a little Christian in every man I would hope). From start to finish I experienced laughter, heart pounding excitement, tears, and a whole lot of smiling while.<br />I actually turned right around and read it again, like a good movie I got more from them the second time.<br /><br />* A special note that this of all the books is led with more drama, mystery and a little ''who done it'' action and a little less steamy.<br /> A fair opinion to say the least a good ending...
B0061Q13V2|5.0|This book was a revelation of Domininque's true courage & optimism in the face of her  struggles to achieve her dream & to come to grips with her own family life.  It was a page turner to the end. Loved it.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|Better than I would have expected, given the critical and box office drubbing the film took. There's at least a good story here, with a sense of wonder about it, and an epic scale. Though the film does tend to get overwhelmed with the special effects at times, and it does get convoluted almost as much as David Lynch's Dune. Some good actors are mixed into the cast, particularly Mark Strong, who always does such a fine job playing the villain or the heavy. The leads have a fairly good chemistry going on, and the aliens are- unlike a certain George Lucas prequel creation that annoys everyone- rather nicely rendered and not at all frustrating. I think the film requires close attention, and multiple viewing to really appreciate it.
0307279189|3.0|Diehard and recreational runners alike will enjoy this very interesting, haphazard book which not only makes a convincing argument anthropologically that we were \\"born to run,\\" but should have the Athletic Footwear industry very worried!<br /><br />Obviously, much hard work and passion went into this book which celebrates the joy & tears of all kinds of running.  In spite of some unlikable characters (yes, Jenn, this means you) the author celebrates the spirit that drives all of us who hit the road for a mile or two or two hundred.<br /><br />My pet peeve is that McDougall, for all his reverence and admiration to \\"runners everywhere,\\" feels the need to deride/mock Ultramarathoner Dean Karnazes...who is not only a friend of mine, but has done more as an Ambassador for the sport of Running than anyone in modern history.  While I know it is fashionable in \\"ultra\\" circles to blow off his achievements because he happens to be a famous face in pop culture, I'd file it under Unnecessary Roughness.
B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|An earlier reviewer commented that those who dislike this film are fans of films like Hostel and lack the discernment to appreciate something like the Innkeepers. I am not a fan of Hostel, and there were a number of things I liked about the Innkeepers. I enjoyed the naturalistic approach to the characters, the leisurely (and realistic) story development, and Sara Paxton's winning performance as Clair. But the film was ruined for me in a single moment - when Clair goes into the basement to trigger the climax. I cannot abide movies that hinge on a character doing something no one in the real world would ever, ever do - a spontaneous burst of insanity clearly designed to get that character into a life-threatening situation. Clair herself says she doesn't want to go back to the basement, even as she moves to descend the stairs. It's absurd. Absurd and obvious and nothing that happens after can suprise or shock or even move us. Seriously. The screenwriter spends all this time creating a likeable, believable character - then throws her out the window and substitutes a mindless, self-destructive idiot for the last act simply because he's either too lazy or too unimaginative to create a plausible means of reaching the finale. It's infuriating. It isn't sloppy film-making, it's sloppy writing. It's sad. I give it two stars for Sara Paxton's performance. Her wasted performance.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|Growing up in the 80's, this brought back some good memories. Well sung. Mary J Blige does excellent renditions of some tracks, too. Tom Cruise also did a great job playing Stacee Jaxx. Great tracks, missing a few from the original musical. Bought it for 7bucks( went on sale a week later for 3), oh well......
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love reading the Bible and all of God's amazing Word. This app made it simple to read my favorite scriptures at ease. I would like to thank the one how made this app and God bless.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|If you like playing any board game, or are like games that require a bit of strategy then you have to buy this.<br /><br />Have been playing it daily with my roomates since I bought it nearly a month ago.<br /><br />Only drawback is that the outer ring that holds the tiles in place doesn't do a great job. But with a few magnets or glue if you want a more permenent solution fixes it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read these 3 books fairly quickly.  There were times I wanted to just shake Ana and times I couldn't believe all the drama in their lives I still couldn't stop reading.........  I'm not sorry I read them.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Hated the pop ups!  They were hard to get rid of on my Kindle.  I 'd rather pay for this app than deal with the ads.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful characters, great story.  You have to read the entire trilogy.  Book two is slow in the first half.  Book two also ends  abruptly.  Hang in there.  The third book is very good also, and ends with a sense of completion.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Text reflow mode is excellent for reading PDF documents on the small screens of phones and even some smaller tablets.  Until version 9, I loved this app, and its reflow capability.  In version 10, this functionality is broken.  Reflow mode is still there, but it breaks words across lines.  Makes smooth reading completely impossible because you have to stop at the end of pretty much each line to figure out that last word.  Given that reflow worked correctly (words that were too long to fit on the previous line were moved to the next line in full, not broken across lines), this bug seems to have been introduced due to poor quality control.  This app would be worth 5 stars if this issue is fixed.
B0086700CM|4.0|Like I said it's a great game for you and you kid's to play. Great for keeping you on or (your brain) on your toes. I love you have to think ahead of time and around every corner there's something new which keeps you thinking. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seems sometimes it takes to long to get to a next level. Other than that what's not to like? I play it all the time as well as my 11yr old who loves it too; my 5yr old still has a hard time with all the moves but I think it great for hand eye coordination and strategy. I'm hoping to download another version for our kindle fire which to me in and of it's self is great! This hands down is a great game to play for free!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|This was actually a pretty good movie. It was also super handy that I had it for more than 24 hours to watch as well. I would definitely watch a movie on amazon again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can say I hate reading but I luved this book left me wanting more!! I think the trilogy should have more books!!!

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|nice and easy ready for you to use it. come is hand ever where don't need wifi connection to use it.
B003X27L9U|4.0|Very impressive book. Originally written. Grabs attention and keeps it till the end. The author managed to make from relatively boring story an entertaining novel which is worth reading.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is pretty cool.  helps to pass the time.  its fun to play and not hard I reccomend playing it to everyone
0060775858|1.0|I have a 26-month-old who is on par with 5-year-olds for his vocabulary. He loves books, and mostly longer books that tell a story. I saw this at the library and decided to see what the hype was about. I was so confused as to why this is rated so high. My son asked me \\"Mama, what's mush?\\" Um.....I didn't know what to say. What is mush? Is that even a noun? I know mushy is adjective of course. Then the \\"old lady\\" aka a rabbit - so confusing! My son again asked \\"what's an old lady?\\" Well an old lady ISN'T a knitting rabbit. He clearly knows what a rabbit/bunny is. He knows what a noise is, since he always asks \\"What's that noise?\\" when he hears something. At the end when the author writes \\"Goodnight noises everywhere\\" makes no sense.<br /><br />All in all, I think this book is confusing and detrimental to a toddlers vocabulary. So glad I didn't pay for this one and I recommend you don't either! There are books out there that are so much better and valuable!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am still reading the book but so far I have found it fascinating.  [[ASIN:B007J4T2G8 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]The part that I really find interesting is the way Ana's thoughts are written out throughout the book.  It shows how we all know we should not be attracted to certain things and we fight with ourselves mentally to resist them.  Sometimes were are successful sometimes not.  I can't wait to see where it will go and how it will end.<br /><br />Shea
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Being on the Frontiers mailing list, I knew this record (yes, I still call them records!) was coming. And I don't mind admitting that I was excited. Any new release by Asia is something to be celebrated and XXX is no exception.<br /><br />Asia fans already know what to expect. The playing is top-notch; this IS Asia, after all, the members of which are legends in music and absolute demigods of progressive rock. I will confess I am partial to John's voice, which seems only to improve with age...if I still have pipes like his when I'm 63, I'll be most grateful. The harmonies are tight, pure Asia all the way, and while the playing at times does seem a bit restrained after the fireworks of Omega it works for the material. The best way I can describe this, is perhaps this is more of a \\"group\\" effort instead of four guys trying to out-do one another. I like it, and I like it more with each succeeding listen.<br /><br />The songs on XXX are excellent if perhaps not as strong as those on its predecessor but still very much of a kind with Asia's previous works. I'm thinking maybe Alpha is a good comparison. \\"Face On The Bridge\\" is the single, though personally I would've picked \\"Faithful\\"...what a wonderful tune, the kind of song you can see yourself singing to your spouse or partner. The bonus track is a second version of \\"I Know How You Feel\\", which is also a wonderful song, though the more understated second version easily tops the original. You may disagree, I just happen to think this is one of those cases where less is more, and the bonus track really IS a BONUS.<br /><br />Frontiers has been doing a great job of producing and packaging their acts, and the tri-fold \\"deluxe\\" edition of XXX includes a DVD with the videos for \\"Face On The Bridge\\" and \\"Faithful\\", plus the same sort of \\"The Making Of...\\" Frontiers included with the newest Yes album. You could probably see this same stuff on YouTube, but if you really dig this sort of thing (and I do) it's nice to have a personal copy of it. And of course the artwork is superb. Roger Dean is still the king of the Prog sleeve, and it's nice to see the dragon and pearl back. I want a POSTER!<br /><br />I guess I should feel spoiled, and maybe we are...in a two year time span we have seen the first Yes album in over ten years neatly sandwiched between two Asia albums, and all three are hugely entertaining. These are fine days indeed for Prog fans, and for music in general. May they go on, and on, and on, and...
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Well done. It's great to hear a full orchestra playing music that stirs the emotions. Part of a great trilogy.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|I'll make this short. If you're an Asia fan--and even if you're not!--this is a must-have. Call it what you will: prog, arena rock, whatever...this is magnificent. As much as I love Phoenix, this is still better.<br /><br />While it doesn't have a single stand out track like \\"An Extraordinary Life\\", it is consistently better throughout. Amazing! People who look for weak tracks will probably find them, but just plain folk will enjoy this record from start to finish. Even the bonus track is a playful bit of fun. Better still, this record is so...positive! No, really. You could start off in a sour mood with this disk in, but you won't stay depressed long.<br /><br />It's hard to pick a favorite in such a collection, but \\"Light The Way\\" is the one I keep going back to. I doubt it could ever be a single in these grumpy days in which we live, but there you go. Thanks to Frontiers for believing, and once again to Geoff, Steve, Carl, and John for another terrific effort. More, please! And tour in America again soon!
B00005QZWI|5.0|Part of the trilogy of CDs I recently bought. Real orchestra. Sit back and enjoy hours of great movie music.
030758836X|1.0|This is frankly an awful book.  The main characters are not at all interesting ...they have no redeeming qualities. One is a sociopath and the other a liar and a cheater they both get what they deserve ... each other.  The actions of the sociopath are far fetched magical thinking type of things.. like for instant...if someone cuts you off in traffic you think about doing something... she does it...over and over.  This is one of the most disappointing books I have read in a long time.  I do hope I have better luck selecting something to read next time.

0525952616|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable read that hooked me from the first page to the last.  This is a book that stays with you.  The other day I was walking in the woods and I heard a buzzing in the trees above my head.  My first thought was \\"DRONES,\\"  but it turned out to be just a large bug.  I have no doubt that soon it could very well be surveillance drones on patrol.  Does anyone else have a problem with this?  Kill Decision is entertainment, no question, but the technological issues Suarez explores are real and important - and need to be discussed.  The future is NOW.  Are we ready for it?  Read this book and find out.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Awesome performance when Michael was at the top of his game!!!  Lots of great music and signature dance moves.  Great band behind him as well.  If you're a MJ fan this is a must have performance.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I received a sealed new set and found it to be perfect. All discs work fine. Only problem I have with it is that it is not divided into seasons but rather 6 parts, and some parts overlap multiple seasons and some seasons overlap multiple parts. If you wanna watch a season you gotta look up which discs go for which season. However, if you are going to sit down and watch the entire series straight through, this is not a problem. True fans will enjoy. I do caution parents though, as the subject matter is unedited and is often adult themed.
B0031PP2WC|5.0|I bought this, because when I rented it from my local library, the DVD was scratched. I tried netflix, but they did not have it anymore. Since I did not want to ruin the flow of my season one re-watching (even though I knew what happened). I really enjoyed this show, and this episode is one of my favorites.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a good game. but it could use a litter more I don't now something its a great game though.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was an enjoyable book. I put it down as 4 stars because I don't consider it at the top level with books like Consent to Kill which would be my standard for 5 star thrillers. Having said that, I liked Gone Girl enough to go back and purchase Dark Places, the second novel from Gillian Flynn. I actually liked Dark Places a little better. I thought the characters were more believable.
B004QX07G4|4.0|In Seriously...I'm Kiding she takes something serious as her own life and turns into a humorous adventure.Unlike other books she doesn't have a dramatic beginning and climax. No! She just writes about random things (or thoughts) in her life. It's one giant laugh fest. Or a better way of putting it: It's her talk show in book format. As I read this book I could not help but feel Ellen Degeneres was sitting in my living room beside me. She was right there. Beside me. Talking as if I were her best friend.

The facts of the the true story, and the author's hypotheses, also ring as authentic.<br /><br />One difficulty I had is that it was a chore trying to connect the atmospherics to what was happening where in China with regard to the Japanese, the Kuomintang, and the survivors of the Long March. I realize the author had to make some decision about how much background on larger events to include, and made a decision to include only what was necessary to his core text, but the overall situation could have used a few more paragraphs every 6 months or so.<br /><br />The facts of the mystery, the investigations and the details of its solution unfortunately suffer from the tyranny of this being a true story -- of having to hew to the known facts as we can discover them.<br />From my perspective, the devotion to the limited factual material interferes with the coherence and balance a work of fiction on the same subject very likely would have had. We are left at the end with too many unasked obvious questions, and with the peculiar lack of persistence or intelligence in the investigative process. ( Not the author's; the characters'.) This work might serve as a ringing castigation of the forces that were in charge, if any of them were in office and in charge somewhere today, but the author's refusal to \\"connect the dots\\" and to only raise unanswered questions in some elements of the story, but to speculate freely -- and probably astutely -- in other parts, leaves a reader with a measure of frustration at the end.<br /><br />In a sense, the work was both not quite scholarly or<br />big-picture detailed enough( a map of China in 1935-38 would have helped), and yet, on the opposite side of the coin, was not aggressively fanciful enough in attempting to identify the motives and relationships that probably affected those in the varying chains of command with respect to the probable villains, both actors and accomplices.<br /><br />My best guess is that this author is an excellent scholar who would benefit from working harder at the core elements of telling a story, true or not. A few<br />weeks of reading and applying the admonishments spelled out in Aristotle's treatises on drama and poetics might be very productive.<br /><br />Mitchell

B006RUJST6|5.0|Let me start out by saying this was the BEST book I have ever read, and reading is my passion! I was a little skeptical starting this book, it had such great reviews, and that usually sets my standards too high. Not in this case, I wish there was 6 stars I could give Colleen! I have never read a book even slightly similar to this, it's about Lake and Will. Lake moves next door to Will, instant sparks, they go on a date to a poetry reading. (the poetry is called Slamming, I've never heard of it, but sounds very cool!) That Monday, Lake starts school at her new High School only to find out Will is her teacher! Without giving more away, there's some really great twists and turns along their way. Great characters, Will and Lake's little brothers are a riot! Lake's mom has so much depth, and her character plays such a huge part in everything going on in their lives. This book is a must read! I am so excited for Colleen Hoover, she knows how to write an amazing story!

B005LAIGWS|3.0|This follow-up to the first Ghost Rider is not that good.  Set in Europe, much of the<br />plot seems contrived, and Nicholas Cage looks old and tired.

1449389627|2.0|The Myths of Innovation reads like a bunch of inspirational talks at conferences. It says a lot of obvious things about innovation which could only be new and riveting for a general audience that has never thought about these issues before. The main innovation promoted in the book seems to be \\"Hey, let's imagine writing a book without paying editors or following rules! Let's footnote a lot of side issues to show all the arcane stuff I've read! Because I don't think you can use Wikipedia to find out info, why don't I put a link to the Wikipedia article as a footnote!\\" This book is 1% inspiration and 99% padding. I think the high ratings are because the book is an inspirational talk--its contents are irrelevant and easily forgotten, but you are left with a drive and \\"I can do it!\\" feeling. It's like chanting \\"Yes We Can!\\" in a large crowd. Its true title might be \\"I Am Innovation, and So Can You!\\"

B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Warrior is a sports drama about two brothers entering a MMA tournament to earn $5,000,000; we also see their difficult relationship with each other and their formerly alcoholic father play out.<br /><br />Warrior has amazing performances from both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton. The conflict between them plays out very well because of how great they play their characters. The MMA fight scenes are realistic and exciting; Tom Hardy is especially vicious in his scenes. What I really liked about the film was how it changes the sports movie formula. Most sports films have one underdog athlete that ends up winning. This film has two; it made me question who i was rooting for and why? The ending was great, brilliant acting, it has amazing music, and a heartfelt story.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend watching Warrior. As of 8/8/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is also highly recommended.<br /><br />Warrior has violence and blood, the fight scenes are gritty and realistic. No sex or nudity.
1594744769|5.0|Note: For some reason, the ADD TITLES feature of my Media Library will not allow me to add this book and I don't know why. I did not purchase it from Amazon so that could be why even though that is exactly what the ADD TITLES feature is for.<br /><br />This book is one of the most imaginative and creative books I have read in a long time. The concept is derived from finding vintage photos & then creating a story around them. Because of this, I found this book delightfully strange yet filled with the wonder and magic of child's mind, eye & heart. This book is completely original from concept to execution and gives the reader a chance to be a kid again...<br /><br />That being said, I would have liked to learn a little more about the children and I certainly would have preferred a slightly different ending. But, given the ending that takes place, I will not be surprised if there is a follow up.

B007VLHP9K|1.0|I do not like to write a review which would be less than 5 stars, but I have to make an exception in this case. I own the 6th and the 8th on laserdisc and the quality is fantastic. I wonder what kind of source Sony used for this release but I would say it is a total travesty. Truly the picture quality here is on a bad VHS level. The performance of the 6th is great, the 7th OK, and the 8th sublime on a par with Celi's own Lisbon concert. So all the more disappointing. I would put the 4th on CD here above the EMI version but tad below the one on Meteor label.

B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|Emma is somewhat of a flip from Pride and Prejudice. Not as good, but still worth reading. Emma is the privileged one in her society and as she tries helping a less fortunate friend find love, she discovers that she is not as wise as she once thought. With a steady flow of characters and a great growth depiction in Emma, I just might read this again.<br /><br />The beginning dragged on a bit, you really have to get past 60% before anything particularly interesting happens, and I even really disliked Emma at first. However, she changes slowly (as opposed to the ever upsetting sudden growth that happens so often in other books) and even finds the classic romance of her own. Austin has a way of depicting things that describe so much more than she says. By the end I loved Emma, and even her most annoying companions. Don't read for a fast moving story, but if you want something that is relaxing and refreshing, Emma is your thing.

030758836X|1.0|******Sort of Semi-Spoilerish*****************<br /><br />This book was so awful that I have broken the \\"never comment on books\\" rule.  Usually I let people feel things out for themselves.  I have loved a lot of books that most people would skip right over.  Where do I even begin with this book?  It got huge reviews and I'm thinking I need a great mystery I can carry with me to and from the beach. I didn't think I was getting into anything deep but wanted something to keep my attention. The first part of the book had me somewhat interested.  I admit that I felt strongly that I knew where this was headed and was not really surprised at the \\"twist.  What I was surprised at were the characters this author has created.  I have never been more offended by Amy and Nick.  I truly didn't want to see either triumph in the end.  The stereotypical marriage and how the author sees men vs. women was too much.  To all the men out there I must say, Women have more than two sides.  Most of us are neither the cheerleader, doormat, football loving chicks so you will like us or the vindictive, psychotic, clingy mess that will make your life not worth living.  There is no lesson in this book, there is no path leading us to the answer of \\"oh ok this is why you made the characters that way\\".  It was just life sucks and people are crazy.  I'm so offended by every single character that I could hardly look past that to the dialog.  And oh the dialog, just awful.  There were so many avenues and places the author could have taken us, not even crazy turns, just logical twists that would have made this book so much more.  It felt like halfway through the author just got bored and decided to torture us.

030758836X|4.0|This book has everything you could ask for in a page-turner, beach read. There are two main characters -- Amy and Nick -- who are married to each other. On their 5th wedding anniversary Amy goes missing and Nick becomes the prime suspect. The plot unfolds with both characters telling their side of the story in alternating chapters. Did Nick kill Amy and dump her body? Is Amy really missing? What's really going on here?  It's a study of a bad marriage with two deeply troubled characters.  Loved the book until the last 10 pages, and then the ending nearly ruined it for me.  Until the ending, enjoy a fascinating read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|-----Spoiler-----<br /><br />Well, only a word for this book: Davastating.<br />I had probably thrown it in the wall if ended as a star wars clone, but here we see a modern-time 1984, with the complete destruction of the main character, finally picted as it is: a pawn in the hand of the power.<br /><br />I think that this book is too hard and to give to a less then 18 yo, they simply don't have the political, cultural and emotional awareness to fully understand and process the events in the book. I was stunned seeing how perverse the event turned. In the same time, i was delighted by the depth of political analysis emerging from the words. Repeat: the new 1984, maybe more cruel...
B004LROUNG|4.0|classic Grisham returning to his old way of writing. The first half of the book is truly engaging and the characters are very fun to read about, the end of the book is weaker mainly because one can anticipate most of the events.

1119963192|5.0|At the age of 29.5 years old, I decided that I wanted to learn how to swim with the goal of participating in triathlons, so I'm writing this review from the standpoint of someone completely new to the sport. I had very little experience in the water my entire life (although I've always been in pretty good shape and participated in a variety of land-based sports), could do little more than fight my way across the pool to the other side, and looking back, I grossly underestimated the effort that would be involved in becoming a \\"good swimmer\\", largely because it has taken me a really long time to become truly relaxed in the water. Over 18 months later, I'm still \\"learning how to swim\\" but have made substantial progress (currently swimming at around 1:50 per 100 and trending even lower, which is terrific for me), largely thanks to the Swim Smooth website and the tremendous work that Paul Newsome and Adam Young have put into it taking such a slippery topic and breaking it down into a relatively simple science that's consumable by the masses. (To be clear, that's somewhere around 500 \\"career\\" swimming hours over 18 months, which works out to be around an hour a day on average and seems like a lot...except that there are 6 year olds out there with more career swimming hours than I have accrued, which is quite humbling.)<br /><br />Having extensively reviewed the material on the website, followed the blog, and kept up with everything that Swim Smooth has to offer for over 18 months (including premium products like the Mr. Smooth Enthusiast Edition console, the Catch Master Class DVD, the swim type guides, and products such as the wetronome), I was delighted to see all of the written material immaculately distilled and expanded into what I consider to be a truly definitive reference on swimming -- so excited, in fact, that I purchased a copy of the book directly from Swim Smooth the moment it was available and paid the hefty international shipping for it. I read it almost entirely in one sitting and have reviewed/referenced portions of it almost every day since I purchased it because I'm in the somewhat unfortunate situation of having to \\"coach myself\\" since I live in an area where good swim coaches (which I define as being mostly inline with the Swim Smooth philosophies from a technical standpoint) are very hard to come by even if you're willing to pay the premium to get them on your schedule. Fortunately, the book includes a full chapter on exactly this situation and provides some tips on how to go about conducting your very own video analysis session (both above and below the surface of the water)...and believe me, if you think that you know what you're doing in the water, you will be very surprised once you see a video of yourself and start to break it down frame by frame. If there's one single recommendation I could make to anyone looking to improve their stroke, it would be to conduct some video analysis in conjunction with the guidelines laid out in this book.<br /><br />It's true (and hopefully obvious) that you can't learn to swim by reading a book anymore than you can learn to perform in any other sport by reading a book about it; however, I feel very strongly that regardless of your experience level, you can't SWIM WELL without the knowledge that Swim Smooth has consolidated on its website and curated into this amazing book...and based on what I've observed, you probably haven't stumbled across all of the essential elements that they've put together in this book by sheer good luck, coaching advice, or intuition. Based on so much outdated/incorrect information about swimming techniques on web forums, youtube, and elsewhere, you won't be able to search to find the most accurate information that you'll you need to be successful, so go ahead and do yourself a favor and just bookmark the website and sign up for the weekly blog post notification. If you do, I can almost guarantee that you'll end up purchasing this book, because you'll quickly become captivated by the thoughtful approach that's been put into breaking it all down into a science that you can take pieces of with you to the pool, apply, and start to notice the results after a few sessions.<br /><br />A lot of the Swim Smooth philosophy involves diagnosing \\"cause and and effect\\" situations based on real statistical analysis of hundreds (if not thousands) of swimmers. For example, Paul and Adam observe that around 70% of swimmers have a crossover in their stroke (where the hand out front crosses over the center line of the body), which is a sure recipe for triggering a scissor kick. So, work on fixing the crossover, and the scissor kick may very well take care of itself. Having a well-formed decision tree of sorts to work through as you examine your own stroke is really helpful, because it enables you to focus on issues in a systematic manner. That said, there are lots of great tips and diagnostics for improving body rotation, horizontal body position in the water, breathing, kicking, and many other aspects of your stroke, but some of the most valuable information is about your \\"catch and pull through\\" -- the part of your stroke that generates between 85% to 100% of your propulsion (again, based on real statistics) in the water, depending on how effective your kick is.<br /><br />Are you having trouble breathing in the water? Do you have sinky legs?  Do you only breathe to one side? Should your thumb or fingertips enter the water first? These and many, many more questions are answered in the book. In fact, when you're done reading the book, I can pretty much guarantee that you'll know more about swimming than you are able to put in practice the next time you go to the pool...and that's a good position to be in so long as you follow the book's advice and systematically work through the techniques.<br /><br />Another tremendous aspect of the book (and Swim Smooth in general) is its notion of swim types -- the idea that there are certain archetypes that swimmers generally fit into -- that you can read about on the website. For example, I started as an \\"Arnie\\", progressed into an \\"Overglider\\" and am currently working on becoming a \\"Smooth\\" (although something tells me I might end up being a \\"Swinger\\" before it's all over with.) If you are getting coaching advice that suggests there is only one proper way to do any particular part of the stroke (head position, tempo, kick rhythm, or anything else), you should treat it as suspect and see if you don't find some wisdom in identifying yourself to one of the swim types outlined in this book.<br /><br />As you can probably tell by this point, I simply can't endorse this book enough (and to be clear about something, I have no affiliation whatsoever with Swim Smooth.) It's one of the most amazing resources I think you'll find anywhere, and by far, one of the most useful books I've ever come across in terms of personal satisfaction and benefit that it's provided me. If I were to make only one additional suggestion, it would be to purchase the \\"Catch Master Class\\" DVD from Swim Smooth. Although the book is chock full of really great color photo illustrations, the Catch Master Class DVD is a systematic breakdown of much of the material in the book in a video form, including a lot of high definition underwater footage that you will find indispensable.<br /><br />Best of luck in your swimming endeavors, and I hope you learn to swim smooth!u'll quickly become captivated by the thoughtful approach that's been put into breaking it all down into a science that you can take pieces of with you to the pool, apply, and start to notice the results after a few sessions.<br /><br />A lot of the Swim Smooth philosophy involves diagnosing \\"cause and and effect\\" situations based on real statistical analysis of hundreds (if not thousands) of swimmers.

B007MNV5WU|1.0|Installed the update a few days ago, was sad it killed all my previous scores, but I did a backup restore and so that was ok.  I enjoyed getting 3 stars in all the new and bonus levels, the little eggs were killers for me! and now (8/8) just did the new update and all the levels that I had received on the first update are gone :-( All the bonus levels, everything :-( This time I backed up just before installing the new update, when it said it was going to uninstall my current version I backed up all my games.  very disapointed :-(

B00005N6KG|4.0|These replace Sony MDR-AS35 and their immediate predecessors. Reviewers said they were better for one third the money. Reviewers were correct. The treble is perhaps slightly rolled off compared to the AS35s, but not in the annoying way it is with my old Sharper Image noice-cancelling phones. Sounds \\"softer\\" rather than \\"duller\\", if that makes any sense, but instrumental definition on Wagner is nevertheless good. Where the AS35s were better was in the user details: they fold nicely, they come with an extension cord (short for shirt, long for pants pocket). Unfortunately they break easily as well. The W08L probably won't last any longer, but at the price you can buy three for the price of one, which is what I am going to do shortly. In one word: a sleeper.

0385342063|5.0|Probably I am a little subjectively becuase I love the writing style of Sophie Kinsella.<br /><br />But I think that if you look for a serious, demanding book this is presumably the wrong reading matter.<br /><br />The book is easy to read, so it's perfect if you just want to relax and have fun, in case you sympathize with the main character which I absolutely do!<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about that book are the \\"footnotes\\"... I know it's kind of a joke but I barely read them because I hate it to switch between the lines all the time, even though I'm sure that they are fun, too.<br /><br />To sum up, I strongly recommend that book because it is very entertaining, funny and it absolutely reflects the society of these days.

He struggles with low grades & small size in his goal to attend the University of Notre Dame & play on it's football team. I can't imagine living in the facilities where he did! The odds are stacked.against him & he almost gives up. In the end he gets into the university & makes the football team. I love how he gets to fulfill both dreams. He gets his Notre Dame degree, & plays in a football game under dramatic circumstances. Fantastic!

0061726834|4.0|What I love the most about Delirium by Lauren Oliver is the level of love, emotion, angst and tragedy portrayed in teenage love.  As a middle-aged oldie with a family of my own for some time, I almost forget about all of those feelings of first loves, kisses, and heart break.  You know, when your heart feels as if it might actually burst out of your chest from either end of the love spectrum: falling in love or out of it!  It made me think back to one of my first Junior High dances.  I \\"love\\" that this book turns the entire situation of love into a disease that needs to be cured, because at times it can feel like that.  But I also \\"love\\" the message that comes across as you read:  Love is what makes us human!<br /><br />I did feel that this story took some time to get going though.  When you read a book where the premise is that teenagers are cured of love, you expect to see chicks falling head over heals for your main love interest pretty quickly and while there are tidbits of teenage rebellion sprinkled in here and there through out the book, the true dissension in the ranks doesn't start till the last quarter.  Being that this is a series, this might not be a fair assessment because all that set up could very well be needed for the next installments and I did \\"love\\" the main characters Lena, Hana, and Alex.  I also appreciated the lack of \\"cheesiness\\" in the writing.  In a book about love, one could be a danger of going over board on this, and nothing pulls me out of a story more then feeling the need to roll my eyes the entire time.<br /><br />All in all I really did love this book and have moved on to Pandemonium by Lauren Olive.  This one is already moving along quite nicely.
B00846TTDG|5.0|deepest appreciation to those who sacrificed themselves for the safety of this country! this movie is powerful and potent in moving your spirit telling you just like it is in real life. No fancy movie stars but they are the stars of our lives. Proud to be an American!

B0037VNX44|2.0|I saw no character development.<br /><br />The flick just throws you to the wolves to be devoured of any sanity.<br /><br />I don't watch much, but the first 30 minutes were all I could take. If you have the patience this might be interesting.
B00029D0B0|4.0|I bought this product as a birthday present for my husband.  He's wanted to get into models for a while and this one seemed like a great place to start.  He hasn't started it yet but he's so excited to do so :)
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As usual, this was another great work by Nicholas Sparks.  I usually read just a few pages a night before falling asleep - I had to force myself to shut off the Kindle and go to sleep.  Great Great Great!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Omg omg omg loved the book!!! Can't wait for the next one! sylvia Day you are def gifted! I purchased more of your books after reading Bared to You because I just couldn't stop!

B005LJKEXS|5.0|Received the cable in about a week of ordering.  I needed this cable to connect my HP printer which is sitting at the far corner of the my office to my computer.  So far so good.  I would recommend this product to a friend.

1619491370|5.0|For most of 70-something years, I've heard about Pollyanna, and during the last forty or fifty of those, I heard the word used in a perjorative, mocking, cynical tone. At a county library book sale, I picked up both Pollyanna and Pollyanna Grows Up for a quarter each. These copies originally belonged to some young girl who, like most girls do, wrote her name and address in flourishes. I determined not to be ignorant of the real deal any longer, so I read half of it late one evening, staying up past midnight. Like a child, I couldn't wait to finish it, so the next night, I continued, turning the last page at twenty minutes after midnight. All lucky, beautiful, well-fed, well-rounded, well-dressed, well-loved, aged ten-going-on-eleven girls who \\"hate\\" their lives, would be well served to be acquainted with Pollyanna. I intend to offer the book to my granddaughter, one of those described above.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Book was badly written & I'm sorry but the story line was pathetic. I only continued to read & finish it hoping there would be a twist , it would improve & to try & understand what all the media hype was about. It was also very repetitive with so many phrases. It was neither a good read & certainly not errotic or an exciting read in any way.

B002WJI63A|5.0|My 5 year old son is a Mario nut. He watches the Mario shows on DVD, plays Mario on his 3DS, and he has all of the Mario plush characters we could find at Walmart. Luigi, Mario, several Toads and Yoshis in different colors. I work for the family plumbing company, so he came and picked out some PVC pipes to make his own Mario Land. He named his Rat Terrier puppy Yoshi. He is all about some Mario.<br /><br />Thing is... He LOVES Princess Peach. Every time we check a store for Mario plushies (gotta make sure we have all the colors, right?) he's disappointed that there's no Princess Peach. He is totally IN love with her. He's been at his daddy's house for summer visitation and while there he left Mario on a lamp and he melted. We quickly made plans to replace Mario and while getting through that I got to thinking... SURELY there's a Peach out there somewhere. Where do you turn to find the impossible to find? Amazon! And there's Peach! She was bought and on the way in minutes. Now she's sitting at the house eagerly awaiting her Prince's return on Friday. Joining her is Fire Mario, Bowzer, Goomba, ShyGuy and Boo. A Koopa Troopa will be awaiting him at Walmart's Site to Store pickup when I pick him up. I can. not. wait.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind Peach will be his favorite of his 15 count Mario Bros. plush set. For his birthday in November I'll be getting him Petey, Cheep Cheep, a Pipe, Bullet Bill, Bones, etc. He gets hours of enjoyment out of these plushies, and I think they are wonderfully made, soooo soft, and GREAT for stimulating imaginative play.<br /><br />Though he's determined he's going to make his own YouTube video with them already. Can't wait to see what he comes up with as we work on completing his collection!

B001JNNDE2|1.0|This is the the absolute worst movie ever created. I watched it 3 times....and everytime I have to stop watching because id rather slit my throat than watch this garbage. Its the most boring, dumb, red-neck hick movie ever created.
B002ZG997C|4.0|I only saw this one on the recommendation of a friend.  I expected another post-apocalyptic shoot up the badguys film with no plot.  Well, it had a pretty good plot and a good deal of meaning.  I'm surprised the politically correct Hollywood types let this film be made.  Good job.

B0081KTI0E|3.0|Probably would have given this one four stars for a suspenseful film if not for the really stupid ending.  Without giving much away, \\"they all died happily ever after\\".  It's Ok, but don't expect too much.
0441020712|4.0|\\"Blue Remembered Earth\\" was definitely the most anticipated book on my list for 2012 --- and it may well be that this essentially created an unfair disadvantage. The story presented here is basically only the prologue to what I had expected and what in the end will (hopefully) be covered in the whole \\"Poseidon's Children\\" trilogy. Nevertheless, I enjoyed how my initial thoughts and ideas were being deconstructed with a slowly developing story that seems to be sent off-track by an unraveling mystery spanning the larger part of our solar system.<br /><br />In the end, this is a very contemporary blend of near future science-fiction. Africa has emerged as a flourishing continent from global warming. Humans are augmented by neural computer interfaces and genetically enhanced to the point of underwater dwelling transhumans. The setting includes colonies on the Moon and Mars with golems (or robots) as some sort of remote proxies of people bordering on the singularity theme at some point and self-developing machines.<br /><br />The protagonists are jumping to conclusion a little too easily during most of their solar system paper chase and I'm not fully convinced that this is completely and well motivated. It may be that this will become clearer at a later point. I usually prefer a concise style of writing that doesn't explain everything and all in minute detail. I was somewhat disappointed though, when Alastair Reynolds took the easy way out of explaining a few of his technological inventions which is where he usually shines. This background deserved more exploration in many parts. The characters, although not strictly stereotypical, are too transparent for a large part. That I could not relate to Geoffrey until the very end may have been on purpose and could be attributed to the advancements of humanity in general, but it is never made entirely clear.<br /><br />Altogether, this is a solid science-fiction book. It is entertaining and has some twists and turns that should keep the reader hooked until the very end. Expectations are usually high for Alastair Reynolds and the few imperfections wouldn't carry significant weight for any other author, so I won't be too harsh with him. And I am definitely looking forward to the next installment in this trilogy.keep the reader hooked until the very end.

0307719219|5.0|When Diamond wrote Guns, Germs and Steel he made many of us think about the potential existence in a standard model for the social sciences. We thought about this because the gilded 1990s were so strikingly similar to the roaring 1920s. We began to wonder about what the relationships were. Diamond made a case for several factors in his non-hierarchical model (geography, disease, technology etc). Quickly evolutionary economists followed by attempting build on Diamond's premise through examples such as Eric Beinhocker's book the Origin of Wealth. Why Nations Fail threw all of that logic onto the scrap heap of history by showing again and again that there are some critical factors - namely inclusive or extracting political environments in conjunction with Josef Schumpeter's concept of Creative Destruction. Schumpeter was referring to how the development of technology obsoletes prior technologies and more importantly entire industries. That cycle is what creates all of the societal upheavals. It was for this reason why the authors spent so much time showing how that interplay between these two factors were the most important factors for any social model. Having done so - many reviewers have misunderstood why the authors spent the time to demonstrate these dynamics over thousands of years.<br /><br />The reasons why Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson's book is contribution of monumental significance needs to be understood for very different reasons than the 100 or so reviewers had previously posted to date. I will list them in the hierarchy of significance which the authors overcame from my own experiences.<br /><br />1) They took an interdisciplinary approach to the question. Doesn't sound like much but 10 years ago when many of us attempted to address the central question of a model - academia refused to even allow the constructions of models of this size but more importantly patently refused any interdisciplinary approach inside of the ivory walls. This book has leveled the number one impediment towards a model realization.<br /><br />2) The model features variability. It is not fixed in stone. Any society can move from having healthy inclusive political structures to being hijacked by the few wealthy elites financial interests. This is why they went all the back to the Neolithic period to demonstrate this repetitive cycle. In fact in the agricultural era - extractive politics were the norm and this is why the authors were so thorough in making this point through the ages. This hazard exists just as much today as it existed during the Roman Empires Republic and its subsequent fall.<br /><br />3) They focused on where there exists a tremendous amount of un-mined data, specifically the Industrial Revolution and what triggered it in England of all places. Since Robinson is a native from Great Britain with a doctorate in political science who teamed with Acemoglu (an MIT economist) - we finally had two subject matter experts focus directly on the factors for why industrialization first took root in England and were initially then exported to the West. Huge!<br /><br />4) The authors discarded the hunter-gatherers and other time frames where there exists little data that can be correlated to  answer the question and fused Creative Destruction (technology) with political institutions (social structure) and presented  a construct which is not only the first of its kind but also have placed into our view a viable standard model for the social sciences. Can the importance of Why Nations Fail possibly be overstated? Not from where I stand from. I am hopeful we will see more thinking as they refine this earthshaking construct.d the number one impediment towards a model realization.<br /><br />2) The model features variability.

B000002L42|5.0|Very nice live collection. \\"Book of Liars\\" is the worst song on the album, but one of the very few.  Best version of \\"Reelin' in the Years\\" I have ever heard. \\"Kid Charlemagne\\" is a nice hot pace. Missed Steve Gadd on \\"Aja\\" but the drummer makes it work.  VERY nice for the price. A must for a Steely Dan fan collection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|why would it give u hints.  that takes out allllllll the fun. some r hard and others not. if glue have the kindle fire it has extra levals so its really fun. try it!
B0088WK27S|5.0|Great movie!  Great acting, story line.  Was never bored.  Gerald Butler can do anything.  It is based off a true story, so that makes the movie that much better.
1853104825|2.0|I bought this hoping to get a summary of accident investigations. Instead it is diatribe that goes on and on. I should have known from the childish marketing name \\"Naked\\".<br /><br />It does NOT summarize the data and put it in a form that is quickly usable and understandable so that a pilot can quickly learn from it. Does anyone have time to read on and on like this? I read every week much material so I don't have time for \\"wordy\\" materials like this. The positive reviews neglect to emphasize this.<br /><br />A Readers Digest type summary could be written that might be 100 pages long rather than the 300 pages of densely packed material here that I don't have the time to wade through.<br /><br />For a person writing a report or devoting most of their time to this subject, it is exhaustive in its wondering comments on aviation and why things likely happen. It just spends too much time weaving around for a normally busy person to read it.<br /><br />Look elsewhere for succinct explanations that you can remember or as rules of thumb for actual situations.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app!!<br />it makes hours in a doctor's office go by much faster!<br />its great for children and adults. alike!
1400052181|1.0|I wanted to read this book because of all the good reviews I had read on many webpages. The first pages really caught my attention so I bought it. Unfortunately, this feeling didn't last long because the author writes about some topics ad nauseam and writes plenty information that seems virtually irrelevant to the focus of the reading. The book isn't very organized either. I found myself going back to see the name of scientists that were previously mentioned on the book since a great number of them are mentioned at many parts of the book. Along halfway, I had to push myself to keep reading it but I couldn't do it.<br /><br />Don't buy this book unless you are really interested in the subject or writing a paper for school.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I bought this watch on Amazon.  I picked it over another, I think it was a Pulsar, that looked nearly the same in the photo.  Well, It was maybe 30 or 40 more but I can't tell you how pleased I am.  I wear a number of watches, and I really like this one.  It is kind of hefty, but not heavy.  Also, I do physical work and it has held up better than watches of significant more cost.  I don't dive, but I do use it to shower, wash hands etc.  It looks perfect.  I have never really figured out how to get the date right.  I don't think this is the watch, I just never tried really.<br />I feel this is my go to watch and it fits and \\"feels\\" smooth and comfortable.  It is easy to read when I first wake up in the dark, as the luminous hands and all that are easy, but not disturbing in the night.  The watch works for work and for casual.<br />Love it, love it.  Really surprised, as I thought it would have been other watches worth more money, but this is just the one.

B003YUU62U|5.0|Ok, so for the last few years all my shoes hurt my feet if I wear them all day- I was even rotating them every day to get some relief.  I finally went to moccasins and, at last, my feet feel good at the end of the day- problem is, they can't be around moist ground or you end up with wet feet. Enter Crocs Unisex Hover Slip On- friends have raved about Crocs but I wasn't about to wear those Wooden clog looking things.  Thanks to Amazon's large selection I found some very good looking shoes that are extremely comfortable.  The only minor, and I do mean minor, issue is that the sole doesn't breathe but that's true of most shoes.  Because it has the canvas top the rest of the shoes breathes just fine.  I'm a gardener by trade and these are the most comfortable shoe I have ever found- nothing, other than moccasins, comes even close.  Also, despite being a good looking shoe, they have held up really well.  I've been using them strong for a couple months and they show little sign of wear and no failures anywhere- they are much more rugged than they look.  I wear a men's 9.5 to 10 but ordered the 11 as per recommendations from other reviews and they fit perfect.  Enjoy.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|I do recommend this to compliment the first movie. It was gripping and exciting to watch. Probably not for the younger kiddos. There is intense fighting and they show it.

B005OCHOZS|4.0|I found the style at the beginning of the book a bit sophomoric but I'm glad I stuck with it.  As Scott delved deeper into his experiences his style loosened and I found myself more fully drawn into his narrative.  I'm a runner/\\"wanna be\\" vegan and found the accounts of his training regimen and races very motivating.  I have also tried a few of the recipes he includes and found them delicious.  When my morning run gets to feeling challenging and I want to cut it short I find myself repeating his mantra...\\"Sometimes you just do things\\" to get me through.  If your a runner you will like this book.

1932100660|4.0|There is nothing he cites that can make the leap from eat more plants to eat ONLY plants, which he repeatedly does. I agree with the weaker thesis, get most of your nutrition from plants (80-90%) but moderate animal consumption is perfectly healthy and there is even an argument that it's even more healthy than a strict vegan diet. And he doesn't even talk about fish and seafood or distinguish their nutritional properties from red meat and dairy. He basically considers them the same, but it's fairly obvious that salmon or sardines are more healthy than a hamburger. But to him they are both disease causing animal foods.The way it's written is with the primary goal to convert you to veganism and not to simply give you the straight science. He should be more cautious in his conclusions. He makes the same kind of logical error that a perons who reads about a particular vitamin being good for you and then goes overboard with it. More is better, which considering his credentials is very very disappointing. He should certainly know better.Saying that his info on the big pharma<br /> issues and commercial food production are a revelation.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is fun and I like it. there is meny different levels and as u go though each lvl it gets bigger and more pipes u have to make
B003EVWDR0|5.0|The character's almost appear as if they could really be in an existing culture of they're own... I wasn't expecting it to be that good, boy was I wrong... now... if I could get the darn download. But,you must have an imagination and an open mind just like any other PC generated movie. And like another person mentioned... it does have a plot. It worked for me.

B0063TX06I|5.0|This one put the boys back on top and they stayed there for years to come. They were huge international stars and then this period of music began. The two hits here 'nights on broadway' and 'jive talkin' were danceable and that's the direction that would lead them into the stratosphere, and lets be honest disc is five times better than rap or hip hop will ever be.  But the bee gees on this one are rock and good rock at that. They do it right on this cd. It's a good one to own with well crafted songs of a master group. Sadly only one of the brothers is left, even andy  is long gone. Btt their music lives on.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is very enjoyable.it also keeps you busy..fun to build lots of animal homes..great game..time consuming so you will not get bbored..  enjoy...

B007U1FEJE|5.0|As I've said in other reviews, I've always loved The Beach Boys.  I was hesitant to buy their new album, as I've heard many of my favorite bands trying to sing recently, and they just don't have the ability to sing anymore.  But, when I read the reviews on Amazon on this album, I decided to give it a shot.  I'd also heard them sing the title cut on Good Morning America, and liked it.<br /><br />The album is amazing in that this band can still sound like they did 50 years ago!  Their harmonies are stunning.  Face it, they are 70 years old, and still have their vocal abilities!  God love him, listening to Paul McCartney at the Queen's Jubilee and Olympics hurt!  But, The Beach Boys can still make you cry with their vocals.<br /><br />I have edited my original review from 3 stars to 5 stars.  Why?  Well I found that I keep listening to this album, over and over again.  And every time that I listen, I like it more.  Originally, I complained that it needed more movement and rock.  Maybe so.  But, I keep tapping my feet to it, and like it.  The darn album grows on me every time I hear it.  Now, six months later, it's getting better and better.  So, 5 stars it is!!!
B007MLDC2I|4.0|The picture and audio quality was excellent. We streamed the movie live through our Roku2XD player. There was a few buffering problems but overall it was an excellent way to view a film.

0345803485|1.0|I'm not usually one to jump on the bandwagon about a book, or to read it just because it's on the bestseller's list.  But people have been mentioning this book everywhere. I've heard references to it on late night talk shows and it's definitely been water cooler talk at my workplace.<br /><br />I should have gone with my instincts and left it on the shelf.  The writing is horrible, and that was visible in the first few pages, but I stuck with it for a bit hoping that the plot might make up for the bad writing. Nope!  Bad writing AND bad plot, and I use the word \\"plot\\" loosely.  I got about halfway through it and gave up, left with no clue as to why this book is so popular....I guess a little titillation makes up for all of this for some people. I'm just not one of them.

B008IJTFYW|4.0|Great app, it works exactly as it says and keeps the kids entertained. Ability to layer sounds is great as well.
B000MRA5EM|5.0|The 3d in this film , like all the undersea 3d adventures is excellent. 3d really shines for underwater photography.  The film features a beautiful soundtrack and alternating narration from john depp and kate winslet. They are speaking to you and it works, there are actually one star reviews complaining the music is too loud, actually they are wrong ,this is mellow music and the words come through clearly. This like most imax products is only 40 minutes long but each minute is fascinating and poignant as we learn that 90% of large fish have been taken out of the sea by overfishing, mankind is very good at wiping out everything in his path though. we have known that for years. Still this is a wonderful 3d movie that inspires awe. It takes place in reef areas mostly and not the deep sea. Those creatures down there in true deep would make a great movie though.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love it its awesome the movie is good and they give you alot of money and fun my family like it

0802473156|5.0|The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts is a great book at helping to understand that we all express and receive love in certain ways (languages).  This book goes into five different love languages that people use to give and receive love.<br /><br />I wish I would have read this book prior to my marriage. I would have been more likely to see that my wife and I were not communicating in each other's love languages very well.<br /><br />I will probably be purchasing this book again as I constantly have it out on loan to friends/family. I may buy several copies to give as wedding gifts and also for friends whose relationships are going through testing times...<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book for anyone and everyone. It helps in relationships other than romantic as well.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This is an awesome CD.  I have really enjoyed it thus far and certainly adds more flavor to my Linkin Park collection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a game where you connect color dots with its twin. At first it seems very easy, but it becomes really challenging and addictive. This is a game I would certainly recommend.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I love this show, and purchased this DVD as a gift for my mother. She enjoys the show as well, but never gets to see it when it's on TV.  The DVD showed up in plenty of time for me to give it to her for her birthday, even though I ordered it just a few days before I needed it.  The Sherlock series is very quick witted and entertaining.  I wish there were more of them on TV every year.  I love the fact that it's set in modern day England. The writers and director and actors have done a great job translating the classic Sherlock Holmes stories into modern times.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Great music. That is all you need to know. If you like the Head and the Heart you would probably like of Monsters and Men.
B0040JHLEK|5.0|I overpronate and found the Brooks Adrenaline GTs several years ago, the best I found for preventing overpronation in my feet.  I have gone through many editions (I think the GTS3 was the first one I got about eight years ago) and this one is even better.  I do run a lot and thus my running shoes do wear out and need to be replaced. Quality is top-notch.

0812993292|4.0|I was touched by this story of a simple man who suddenly tires of doing nothing and starts walking to save someone who was a friend to him many years ago.  Harold is not the most interesting or exciting character but you find yourself sympathizing with him and hoping that he finishes his walk to Queenie.  Harold meets lots of different characters on his journey, some helpful and some not.  They all add something to the story that helps it move along without getting tedious.<br /><br />The most emotional parts of the book are the ones that deal with  Harold's relationships with his wife and his son.  Joyce does a wonderful job of relating his sense of helplessness and regret when thinking about his child and his wife.  There were many times while reading that I felt that it was too late for things to change for him, so much time and hurt has passed, but until the end I was hoping he would find a way to mend his broken relationships.<br /><br />Harold's wife Maureen goes through a lot of changes herself while waiting for Harold to return home.  I think that watching her open herself up to others and begin to make positive changes in her life was the best part of the book for me.  Harold's decision to walk effected more lives than his own.<br /><br />The writing throughout was good, there were a few times I was really impressed with a sentence or a description of someone.  This is a good book about facing mistakes made, learning to forgive, and moving on in life.  I enjoyed this book about this quiet, simple man and the journey he went on.
0439023513|1.0|Let me first start by saying that I absolutely adored the first book in this trilogy, The Hunger Games. It was incredibly well written and I felt like I really got to know the characters. I loved the amount of detail the author went into, and as soon as I finished this first book, I could not wait to start reading Catching Fire.<br /><br />Book Two: Although Catching Fire was not quite as wonderful as The Hunger Games, a lot of the same emotion, detail, and character development were present in Catching Fire. Definitely not disappointed.<br /><br />Enter book three - Mockingjay. I'm not sure whether the author was under pressure to finish this book by a certain deadline or whether she was just getting tired of writing about Katniss, Peeta, and the rest of the Hunger Games gang, but it felt like she was in a hurry to finish the book. As a result, it was missing all of the detail and character development that I loved so much about the first books. It was totally lacking in this book!! I thought the author would use this book to tie up loose ends, explain what happened to the characters, explain how the war really did change them, and then give us more insight into their lives post-revolution. Nope. Nothing! I mean, honestly, locking Katniss up for a few weeks just to avoid giving details about her trial? What a cop out!<br />In addition to the lack of detail, which is my number one complaint, there's also a total lack of emotion. Think back to Rue's death in the first book - I cried like a baby because the author gave so much detail and explained the pain Katniss felt! In this book, some very major characters died, yet I felt nothing: \\"Oh, so XXXXX is dead? K, cool. Moving forward.\\" I don't think that's how Katniss felt, and I don't think that's the reaction the author was really going for.<br />I'm not going to complain about the plot, because although there are a few things I would change, I'm sure the author knew where she wanted to take it. My complaints are completely, 100% about the execution and quality of writing.
B007CMD5EC|5.0|One different Cd for sure but John can sure shred. They should invite him to the G5 tour he would be good. He really shows off his various skills on the fretboard here with a little of everything that has influenced him to play. I kind of like what hes playing here although this is my first purchase for me. Great sounding great purchase get it.

B002MFV2IK|5.0|a lot of fun.  Meryl Streep is wonderful and shows the wide range of her talents.  Bruce Willis also has a role that is unusual for him , which he does well.
