B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is an excellent book. The first chapter seemed cliche, but within a few chapters, this book took hold of my throat and wouldn't let go. Epic, but yet also a fast and compelling read. As soon as I finished the book, I flipped back to the beginning and began to reread it.
0887309372|5.0|Contains more actionable knowledge than almost any other book on branding around. I even prefer it to [[ASIN:0071373586 Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind]]. Great book - burned through it in a day. Then read it again the next day.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I normally don't purchase games, but because of all the great reviews I decided to and I'm glad I did!
B004UNX1LS|3.0|does not have as many songs as could be found on youtube or iTunes or amazon but still has plenty
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love, love, love this series! Sylvia Day's books never let me down. Anxiously awaiting the next book! Will definitely be purchasing it too!
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|The music is great!  The colors are extraordinary brilliant!  The characters are wonderful!  The filming is sharp with a lot of depth.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Another game flying thru around and over stuff.<br /><br />For the kiddies !!<br /><br />They will love all that action.<br /><br />For me totally boring !
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We must be one of the last to see this great series - if you are like us give it a try I know you'll love it.  This is an example of what good entertainment looks like!!!
B004GYY714|4.0|Not quite the satellite station in my car--but it has enough choices to keep me going.<br />Nice choice of musical styles !
B004J4WLB4|4.0|what a pleasure to read and visualize the discription af flowers and characters. Highly recommend it for such a pleasant experience
B000VWE5OY|5.0|This is the spin off series from Dr Who, just watched the 1st 2 episodes.  Great entertainment, good quality sets, the 1st of the 2 episodes both had great creatures to be fought!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|loved reading this book as well as kite runner. the times he writes of brings another culture to life for me
B009JBZH54|5.0|Got this as a gift for my dad as he loves the series! Such a great set and quality for a great price. He was one happy dad!
B00005RDRO|3.0|The obligatory dark and stormy night is taken to task in this parody of crime novels.  Set in a mansion located in the middle of nowhere, guests arrive in time for a good tongue lashing.  Why Neil Simon felt the need to upbraid famous literary characters rather than their creators is a moot point but one that shouldn't be ignored.  Assuming Simon had a point to make rather than just taking potshots at better authors who have created some of the most enduring characters in all of literature.<br /><br />For me, Simon's humor was hit and miss.  I chuckled a few times, enjoyed several of the actors (felt sorry for others in the cast).  I thought Peter Sellers was perfect as Charlie Chan.  I love Elsa Lanchester as a general rule.  Alec Guinness had the toughest role and did the most with it.  Nancy Walker was wasted in a role that required little and little were the results.  She was literally the brunt of the joke.<br />Some of the jokes were inspired, some were just plain desperate (as with the house numbers of the estate: two two twain).  Truman Capote's appearance was suspect from the start and did little to help the cause.<br /><br />Whether or not you'll enjoy this movie depends entirely on your sense of humor, whether you're acquainted with any of the literary characters involved, or whether you enjoy one author lampooning the work of dead authors who can't defend themselves from the ridicule heaped upon them.<br /><br />This is the second time I've watched this movie.  Back in the 70s, I thought it was fun, now, not so much.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I am a fan of this app primarily for one reason - if you stay away for a few days, there are no losses.  so many of the games have time limits where if you claim the prize within a specific time - the prizefighter is lost.  most of the dragons can be bred but takes a lot of attempts.  if you want to buy the dragons you can buy gold and purchase them.  some of the dragons are expensive.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|Not to my movies can make my stomach turn and feel sick and in all there might b 5 to 10 that do. I Spit on Your Hrave is one of those. Its a remake of a classic with such brian shockinh awe it hurts. This is the most grotesque but utterly brilliant revenge films of all time. Rach death just get worse and worse as Sarah Butler's character deals out a unique and original kill. The cinematography and acting are mind blowing with realism and Sarah Butler gives one hell of a performance. Hands down a tremendous horror/revenge film.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed the characters and the story lines in this book. I was happy with the \\"silver lining\\" ending.  I look forward to watching the movie.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|Bryan Singer brought Jack snd the beanstock to life in an amszing way. The special effects and scenery were beautiful fully taken u to a new world on an old planet. The cinematography is on que like in every Singer film.the way he films everything just comes to life. Of course all of the actors give great performances really bringing the characters alive. I havent watch the 3D version yet but I'm willing to bet it will spectacular. The Ebdind could've been 10 to 15 minutes longer but in all a really good film with a good story, effects, acting, directing & amazement truly worth watching.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|It seems to me like Marvel let the director of this movie have too much freedom and reign over this property. In the last adventure, we saw Tony's suits being able to take the blunt hit of Thor's hammer and also survive a \\"tale of Jonah\\" trip through a giant leviathan alien. Yet here, the suits cannot withstand being hit by a truck or punched through by a flaming woman. The inconsistencies in this movie is just too overbearing and is why I consider it a terrible ending to what could have been a great trilogy.
B003TXKSWK|3.0|I bought this because I like John Legend's voice, but I must say I was disappointed in the CD.<br />Not the Seller's fault.  It did arrive quickly.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So much information right at your fingertips.  However, it is addictive.<br />A real time sucker.  Love it none the less.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The best thing on tv. Please hurry up with Season 4. We can't wait. Is it true they have started filming?
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the real time maps and hourly weather prediction. I like that you can have more than one location.
B0011MRKHW|3.0|The second half of the movie picks up into a nice pace but overall, I think, the first movie (which is intended to be an alternate version of history) was much more entertaining.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Mr. DeMille hits his mark in this latest installment of the John Corey Series.<br />DeMille did his homework on Yemeni culture and as usual puts you in the drivers seat. Very detailed and well written. A must have for all fans if the Corey series. If this is your first time in this ring then it's all you need to read to want more. You'll be reading all of DeMille's works from start to finish. Enjoy!!!
B0078Q2HAA|3.0|Meryl Streep's performance is flawless, of course, but the style of the movie, or rather how the story is put together and delivered is much too scattered to be taken seriously. I think this method of directing works for movies like Memento or Mulholland Drive but it did not do a good rendition here.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging but not hard. It's entertaining to anyone. I highly recommend this game to anyone. Also its free!!! It can't get better than that.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I have never played this game before and blowed my mind. The Colossus are very colossal and the PS2 developers did not joke about the size of the monster. The OST are majestic and every time I play I smile with the battle music. Excellent choice.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great kids movie, will make the older audience laugh also. Once you watch this one you'll have to watch the second one.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really enjoyed the book... but then I got to the end & found out I have to wait for another one...
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I think it is a very fun game to play, I think it is a game that you can really brake through. I give it a four and a half to a five in my opinion
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Has everything you'd expect from a summer blockbuster movie.  It does have some cheesy parts but the special effects and the Robert Downey Jr quotes save the day.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you are a Downton Abbey follower, this is a must watch season.  The story lines were great and the overall themes built this season with great richness.  As usual, the writers did not forget to leave us with a phenomenal cliff hanger that will have us all going crazy until the next season starts; ugh!  Still loved every minute of it.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Page after page was starting to be the same boring alpha male book.  There's a forth book too?!  Really?  Why?
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This was a book I read for my church book club.  They chose this book based on Hosseini's previous book &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;, which I haven't read yet. I had a hard time following the story because it jumped around from character to character and I had to figure out how the characters were related. I was about to give up reading it but the club said it had a better ending which connected the related characters together. I'm hoping when I read The Kite Runner, I will like it better.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Like all shows the writing gets better the actors have my developed characters, so better the second season.  The first season rocked.
B00BLGZDVS|5.0|This story's ending is not great. There is no great denouement or great explosions at the end. In that sense, it was a bit disappointing. But, you are probably not seeing this to get the completely-exhausted Hollywood formula script, ¿right? This movie is a fascinating examination of the early days of the Scientology cult, and Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stellar acting performance. I am definitely going to be on the lookout for his next movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Both characters are perfect, and all the supporting actors too.  Donna is my favorite! (watched it on Amazon, for free, since I pay once a year for the prime membership, which has paid for it selve at this point.)<br /><br />Both guys can be dicks..but their both hot so they can be.
B007YJS7G4|4.0|The narrative is a bit Hollywood-schlocky. But it is good fun for the family. It should also be noted that the special effects - simulation of the aircraft of the period in dogfights- is fantastic, if you are a WWII aviation buff.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is one of those stories that sticks to your mind for a while.  It is a great read to begin with and it can be just that if you're looking for a dose of science fiction thrills. But it is hard not to turn its themes around in your head and consider at these from various perspectives. Once you start doing that, you realize how deep the story really is under a facade of a space adventure. The author appears to know that you would want more of the deeper stuff and was kind enough to explore that in the sequel, \\"Speaker for the Dead.\\"
0307730700|5.0|The ending brought me to tears. Tears of hope, knowing that out there, there are real HEROES like Adam Brown, that stand for freedom against evil.<br /><br />Adam's story is a true motivation for any true warrior out there - a protector, \\"Tender Warrior\\", being a good human being first, a soldier, and then a leader. This is a MUST read for us. An inspiration in tough times, a guidance. Adam is defiantly one of my role models.<br /><br />I salute you - Adam Brown, and the rest of the fallen in your team.<br />May your soul rest in peace, and your legacy spread through the world.<br /><br />From a fellow warrior, an officer in the Israeli Defense Force.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show with good stories and interesting characters.  Finished both seasons and can't wait for the next season to start. Definitely recommend.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I got the book immediately, began to read it, and several limes looked back to see if I had skipped pages.  The novel read more like a group of short stories as many of the tales were not connected or difficult to connect.<br /><br />How disappointing after Hosseini wrote two great novels.<br /><br />.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Recipes, of all sorts, crafts, pictures, health tips, etc. All of these are stored in one are on your Pintrest page. When you thing of that recipes that you wanted to try, You can find it there if you used Pintrest. Very Good App.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|A great story and action packed! Whole family was able to enjoy this one! This one is definitely worth purchasing!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I get a lot of them in my email. Not sure with just telling stories and sharing pictures. I  like it well enough but sometimes I just want to read a message from my friends and family.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|For a time sink, and believe me that's what this is-it's entertaining. If you like My Little Pony, then you probably already have this-if you don't then you probably aren't reading this. That being said, the game is designed to steal just as much of your money as it your time. If you have any intention of beating the game, you should probably just let the urge go. If you can't, you'll end up having to spend real dollars to get anywhere. It starts out innocently enough but look out, as the levels progress so does the cost of everything. If you aren't prepared to open your wallet, then be prepared to spend days raising the coin to buy the one thing you need for the next achievement. Annnnd then there is another achievement and your broke again, rinse and repeat. If you need something to do, you like MLP, and are tired of playing other better games, then by all means download this.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Sometimes it loses connection. But I have been using this email for a long time. Don't want to change it though. You get used to it.
B00340LM8C|4.0|Ii seems odd to not rate a Hitchcock movie with iconic stars like Cary Grant and Grace Kelly against the backdrop of the French Riviera more highly, but there is something missing from this film. There's no real suspense and the plot does not make you really care too much about any of the characters. But it is required viewing nevertheless.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a perfect ending to the book and the series. The last three chapters were a great way to close out the series.
B001NAT05W|1.0|I know cats like cheese but even too cheesy for a cat. Everything in the movie was simply &#34;off&#34;. She gets one bad movie.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use evermore all the time. It started with school and now I use it for everything. I record teachers lectures, keep a diary, draw, an and even keep a work log. Thanks evermore!
B004UPANAI|4.0|Fits good in the series. Good action flick for some mindless entertainment. Jackman is pretty much cool in everything he makes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|the game can you escape was at times the most frustrating  game i have ever played but when you up<br /><br />opened that door it was so satisfying.  the greatest
B0067TQQI8|5.0|It's very great in size, wight and price<br />Love it<br /><br />Can charge Galaxy S4 from 5% to 100%  2.5 times
B002YK8OKC|2.0|OK I should have known better. It was Chevy Chase and he isn't known<br />for his splendid acting.  The plot was absent the acting terrible and the<br />language offensive.
1781162646|5.0|King at the top of his form lending his name to Hard Case Crime publishers which is very noblble of him. Keeps the genre alive in a context relative to its origens.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke must be viewed! Miyazaki has devled into the creative mind of children to tell a tale of nature vs human kind. and what a world he's created! If you don't see one anime in your life, please make the time to see this. This was also the first time Hayao used CGI. It's at the beginning of the film when the bore is covered with those horrible critters. What a imaginated talent.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Enjoyed the book very much with it's history and development of characters.Being in my 80's remembered the events. One of those books that I was sorry to finish.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|interesting take on a very popular theme in modern culture. the decision to write the story through interviews not a first hand account is interesting but effective for showing the impact worldwide. the downside is you never really care about any of the characters only knowing them for 5 minutes at a time. overall still enjoyable.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|Turthfully, I am just learning about the photo part of the Kindle.  Have not had time to play with the Photo Editor+ yet.  It looks fairly easy though.
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|These stories are fun.  The first person narration style reminds me of that of Amelia Peabody in the Egyptology fantasies of Elizabeth Peters, with the reader frequently aware of nuances that the narrator is oblivious to.  There are werewolves and vampires, each of which seemed to be rewritten into Victorian stereotypical English upperclass town and country types.  Vampires are all foppish townies with absolute fashion sense, while werewolves are all country gentry, rough-hewn hunters ( some of whom are even Scots!) who are never, ever subtle.  Homophobic?  Then these stories are probably not going to be your cup of tea.  Of course, since this is Victorian Britain, there are dirigibles and mad scientists.  Ghosts, alas, while present, have a limited shelf life, gradually going disconnected from the world of the living.  There are, of course, always new ghosts, just as vampires and werewolves are able to recruit mortals, enough of whom survive the process of transformation to make the position of apprentice/servant to vampire or werewolf households highly attractive.  More books in the series will also be attractive to me.
B005LAII08|5.0|Great product for the price. Like to update to 3 D soon with the five disc collection. I would recommend to everyone.
1480054542|3.0|The cover caught my attention and I downloaded this book for free. Now that I have read Finding Pride, I think the cover doesn't portray the story line well. I found the main character Megan well done. Todd, I was a bit concerned with because of his display of anger towards Megan even after he suspected what she had been through. I also didn't like the jealousy shown towards his brother or the doctor. I did like the part Todd's brother and sister plays in this book.<br /><br />As for the plot. I was very engaged for the first few pages and then the story seemed to stall. The author goes into detail with the business and the relationships that are formed. I found it a bit far fetched that Megan's brother had the knowledge and maturity to invest the way the author represents him. I also find it difficult to believe that he \\"rose\\" in the businesses as fast as he did. Unfortunately after a great start to the plot, it became predictable.<br />I found myself skimming through some of the story because of the slowness.<br /><br />I do like that the author has formed a series surrounding the family, but I probably won't pursue the series.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I'm a Senior Citizen just learning how to play.  I find this app fun but it gets to my frustration and I have to rest.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Great music. great message, great movie. Well worth the watch! I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who loves great movies and great history.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|I am not a James Franco fan and was skeptical about purchasing the movie.  Overall, I think he did a good job and that it was a good prequel to the classic film.
B000N3ST9I|1.0|2 Out Of 8 Songs Are Good. Only 8 songs And Most Of Them Suck. Theyre Starting To Sound A lot Like Metallica. Tons Of Songs That Last Way Too Long. Burning Red, More Things Change, And Burn My Eyes Were Great. Now This One Is Just Terrible. Id Get The Cd With Dvd At Least With That You Get A Dvd Concert With Better Songs. Do Your Self A Favor, Don't Waste Your Money Or Time And Don't Get The Next One After This One.
0307279189|5.0|I am relatively new to running and this book was recommended by a coworker. I found the tips and tricks they offer to be extremely beneficial. Also, this book made me give barefoot shoes a try and it has been well worth it. The story is also captivating and well written. This is the first book I have read cover to cover in years. Great read!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It works well and is a good portable size. does what it says. It was a good price and was a nice purchase. It is good for what I wanted it for.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Didn't think  deep characters. just expected more? Sorry Bradley! Jennifer Lawrence should stick to  Playing with bows and arrows. Never again!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Yeah this is awesome. Could be the best since Rust In Peace and far better than anything Metallica has put out in years and i am a big fan.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I really like this game.Me and my brother play it all the time.We just wish there was a multiplayer mode.So if the Created of this game reads this pleases add a multiplayer.And maybe a saddle to ride horses.  ;) thank you
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|As a non-artistic person I love programs that are easy to use and let me draw fun, nice-looking stuff. This program does that very well.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|EPIC! That's the one word I could use to describe this album. Hanson once again did not disappoint with Anthem. It is one of their most hard hitting rock albums with the same 50's soul vibe that we all love. It is definitely a must buy for everyone, young or old, whether a returning fan or let Anthem turn you into one. You will not regret this purchase!
B009HUB40Y|2.0|Can not play this for free, you must purchase items, or &#34;like it&#34; for facebook, removed it from my kindle fire.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Wow, where to begin....<br />Zach, Eric, Barry and Brent deliver an amazingly diverse performance with Amaryllis. This album feels so epic when you listen through the tracks. Something for everyone here. Brent's voice is pure power and this album shows his dynamic ability to use his voice soft and smooth all the way to angry and loud.<br /><br />Unity - I love this song it is beautifully written, perfect vocally<br />I'll Follow You - nothing is as sexy as a powerful rock ballad with a piano a total eargasm!<br />Adreniline and Enemies takes no prisoners<br />Bully is an adrenalin rush from the start absolutely full tilt rock<br />Miracle is a tribute any girl would love to have written for her<br />Amaryllis is simply breathtaking so rich and powerful in one.
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|This game is challenging without asking too much. I am getting tired of games that make me continually fix things and heal people.  This one is broken into bite-size challenges that can be completed in a few minutes and require strategy.  So much fun!!!
1416972242|5.0|First I was a little iffy about a blue haired boy until Jace and his team whipped up on that demon. The story of Clary Fray unfolds slowly and the pieces begin to fall into place creating an intriguing tale. There area so many variables to this story and each one affects another in some unexpected way. I alternately cheered for and against the same people multiple times. Amazing story.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|The colors were very close to what I saw with my own eyes at different depths. Used it for diving in Honduras at various depths (up to 130'). The only thing to watch out for is accidentally scratching the filter.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Jacoby's struggles and brutal honesty about the pain of addiction and his struggles bring a depth to this album I have never before from Papa Roach it is so real, desperately angry and painful at times. The emotion is palpable and not in a wimpy way. This album makes me want to conquer, win, fight and overcome obstacles.<br /><br />Although there are some songs with a lot of random and at times unnecessary electronic noises added to this album but overall I think this is one of the most solid albums I've heard in a long time. Tobin, Jerry, Tony and Jacoby are not afraid to say it like it is on tracks such as Not that Beautiful and Give me Back my Life which are in your face loud.<br /><br />Some other random thoughts about the tracks:<br />Still Swingin' is a song you'll put on repeat until you can sing along with it especially with lines like &#34;I'm killin' it, your burning out&#34; &#34;I'm the real, you're the fake&#34;<br /><br />Leader of the Broken Hearts is so intense lots going on in this musically and vocally.<br /><br />Give me Back my Life and Wish You Never Met Me are why the connection is the perfect name for this album. I connected immediately when I listened the first time.<br /><br />Live For You is the most heartbreaking ballad in recent years<br /><br />Walking Dead makes me think of Zombies, of course it should. Lol
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Now that I am all caught up, I can't wait for season 4 to begin!<br />Not the best acting I have ever seen, but this series has a great story line. The way these people struggle to survive is realistic and interesting (if a zombie apocalypse were possible - haha).
1416955070|5.0|Think about how you would cope if your entire life and everything you knew was a lie. Then top that off by learning you have abilities you never knew you had. This is Clary Fray and now that she's figuring it out, she can't go back but with Jace would she even want to.<br /><br />Simon loves her, Jace is intrigued by her, Isabella can't stand her, Alex is jealous of her, better yet there are demons trying to kill her. The only way out is to live the life she was born to. WOW! Awesome storytelling, this is what fiction is all about folks.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I asked my son to rate this since he plays it...he is 7 yrs old....his review is &#34;I like it a lot&#34;...
B008PNBU30|5.0|By now everyone knows that Three Days Grace is touring in support of this album without the former front man Adam. Beyond the bickering and accusations about who wrote what and why they broke up I must say, I love this album. I am that digital music person who only buys the songs I like yet I bought this album because it was so good.<br /><br />I think Brad Walst, Barry Stock and Neil Sanderson make amazing music. I love to hear the layers and depth of the tracks not just the vocals.<br /><br />Chalk Outline is amazing! I can not hear this song without singing along (often loudly)<br />High Road is beautiful and a solid track constantly added to most of my playlists emotional and rockin<br />Operate and Misery Love my Company are both hard rockin songs that reaffirm 3DG can bring it!<br />Oddly enough, one of my favorites is Expectations which I think is quirky and unique not one they'll play live just a filler
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved the way the author kept surprising me with little twists and turns. The ending was a total surprise and that is important to me. i hate a predictable ending. I recommend this one and will read more from Landay.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It took less than an hour to complete, but it was really fun.  Can't wait for the new<br />levels.  Way worth the money, which was none.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved the book, and felt that the writers/directors/producers stayed close to the story, capturing my favorite parts with beauty and drama.  Acting: superb!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|A spectacular series as usual! I am now ready for season four in January! This show is so well done and addictive.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The story, the acting, the writing, direction and production were outstanding.  I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in history!
B001AFF25W|5.0|This is a great book - very helpful.  I have a lot of different tapes from Brian Tracy (The Psychology of Achievement) was the first group.  He is a wonderful motivator.<br /><br />Marilyn Lester
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Absolutely loved Nemo when first installed. We are on level 25 now and the challenges seem to have become few and far between which has taken much of the fun out of the game for my granddaughter & myself. Getting fish into the reef has become ever more difficult. Not as much fun & anticipation as it used to be.<br />This has absolutely the most beautiful graphics I have ever encountered in a game.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really neat game!!! Great graphics....just wish it was a continual game :)) Disappointed when I realized game was almost over ;)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Felicia Mires style keeps me engaged in her stories. Very entertaining and uplifting I will  continue to look for her novels to read.
B009NY43NY|1.0|... At least it would make more sense....apparently, any character was fair game!<br /><br />I'm so sorry I spent time and money with the work of an author that didn't respect me nor her story.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This app was ok but I ended up deleting it and downloading the accuweather app instead. It is way better in my opinion.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|It does what it says and does it well.  I have had no problem with it and it is very handy.  If you buy it you will find yourself using it.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Love the play first series. Very fun and addictive. Levels get more challenging as you unlock other restaurants. In this one you run different restaurants and serve up whatever foods your demanding customers desire.
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|Just an awesome app, totally recommend it!  I just love this app it is terrific! By this app now Ok !
B00B769XB8|5.0|Entertaining, i already watched it twice. I never read the book. and i know it's not the same. Didn't care too much for kids and witches, But grown up kids out for vengence Yeah!!!
0486424510|5.0|It appears one must step back in time for the greater mystery stories and writers and almost the further back, the better.  Perhaps it is the quieter, gentler era when people employed time creatively, actually thinking and allowing ideas and themes to develop. This is a book that must be owned.  It truly warrants regular re-readings to explore its many facets.
B004H4XI5O|2.0|It too much about experiences and not instruction on how to accomplish a better memory. Too much fluff and history.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|What more could you ask out of a time killer, and it is downright fun, I don't think I would of paid for it but I got it as a freebie that day and haven't regretted it yet. Be sure to check out the daily amazon free apps they are worth it sometimes.
B00000099Y|3.0|I love Tool, as you know, I am an avid listener. The album shipped quickly..arrived on time, but the case is all messed up, and the thing that holds the CD inside securely is bent and now the CD slides around inside. The case itself is bashed up a bit, I am very disappointed that my valuable (To me at least) was at risk during shipping, and the walk home.
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|It's iight I guess... graphics could be a bit better, and need to stop being so damn priced for a frickin fake as gun that can only be used in a damn game
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book was very good and kept me on the edge of my seat at almost every line! It was very sad though. The author used foreshadowing, and sixpence an  imagery to help describe Hannah and her feelings. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope to read the next Jay Asher novel.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Awesome kids movie. Only 88 minutes so not too long. Plenty of things to keep you chuckling.  This movie should be shown to kids for generations to come.
B001NKI60W|5.0|I really like this show.  It always makes me feel good when I see it. Has a great cast and portrayed well.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game it has everything n it explains things well enough that my four year old can play with me.
1931955085|5.0|\\"The Tree Show\\" by Mark Ryden, 3rd Printing 2010. Porterhouse Fine Art Editions Inc., Los Angeles, 1st. Ed. 2008. ISBN-978-1-931955-08-9. HC. 124 Pgs. in 12 ¼\\" x 9 1/4\\" format.  The entireity of this book is one grand inveiglement. Paper quality, binding, color reproductions, and composite presentations are finely arranged and cropped or full-paged in deluxe format.<br /><br />Ryden's \\"Tree of Life\\" painting (sans bees) adorns the front cover, and within are 60 largely full-color high gloss reproductions of his oil paintings, etchings, and sketches, predominantly young maidens, in the Paintings section. Additionally, we are provided with dozens of sketches and illustrations by renowned artists in his book's Introduction and in his Artist's Statement.  The written text provides significant details of the history and significance of trees, an area of fauna Ryden obviously researched in considerable detail and in turn he gives us insight into his strong fondness and incorporation of trees in his artwork.<br /><br />So, now we've discovered a few additional ancillary influences behind Mark Ryden's contribution to the art world that stem from appreciation of Nature. Without question, Ryden has created unique specific niches for novel neo-contemporary styles shrouded or concealing overt/hidden eroticism, diverse symbolic metaphors, surrealism admixed with the comedic, metaphysical, and whimsical. As one attempts to identify more fully with Ryden's art, one may experience an emotional addiction to his especial art genre at the expense of dismissing others that are similar but lacking a certain punch.  Ryden's innovatively different recipe is such as to defy easy explanation,<br />and a fine line exists between saying a \\"certain\\" art form is \\"like Ryden's\\" versus features of Ryden's work seem like the drawings of another.<br /><br />If an opportunity arises to attend a gallery featuring Ryden's artwork, go for it - and let me know, please!<br /><br />finis
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love everything about this series. The story line is great and the actors are fabulous. Keep more (LONGER!) seasons coming. :)
B00499QUK2|5.0|It embarrases other versions on television now. So well done and witty at once. A current update that honor Sir Arthur's original work. I tell everyone i can about it.
B00AN0KGWE|3.0|good show ..... too much sex....too few midgets.....too much incest..... too little of bad people dying..... i like the midget
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We absolutely love the way Peter Jackson chose to direct J.R.R. Tolkein's The Hobbit. We look forward to watching the other two installments. Our only complaint is having to wait so long.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does what I need it to do! Thanks for this free app, I use it quite a bit. The numbers are big and app is easy to use.
193700788X|4.0|I completely was not expecting who Sookie Stackhouse would end up with at the end of Charlaine Harris' series. I suppose I should have, considering what happened at the end of Dead Locked; I'm usually more on the ball when it comes to book plots. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I don't want to post anything else - all comments would be spoiler alerts for those who haven't read the book. I own the entire series, and recommend it.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This season was good but I liked the first better- scarier...This season was more mind games compared to I close my windows at night bc I'm freaked out.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|It's wonderful to see Julia Sawalha (Lydia from &#34;A&E's Pride and Prejudice&#34;) surface as a calm lady who is the centerpiece of this show.  (She's also in the &#34;Cranford&#34; series and wonderful there as well.)<br /><br />&#34;Lark Rise to Candleford&#34; has a bit of a &#34;Cranford&#34; feel but it does occasionally get mired down in soap operatic hokeyness.  Each season has a couple of what I'd call throw away episodes, but overall it's very good.  You'll see many familiar faces -- Martha the housemaid from &#34;Cranford,&#34; &#34;Downton Abbey's&#34; Mr. Bates, and many more.<br /><br />You'll enjoy &#34;Lark Rise to Candelford.&#34;
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I loved the book, I love the music. I  put my player on shuffle and when one of the songs from this album come up, I always stop what I'm doing and listen.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Very good book. I liked book one better. Very violent with many evil characters and murders. Excellent character development. Still interested in book three but the killings are starting to turn me off from the series.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I think I said the same thing about the first two books in this series; I think I like this story better than Fifty Shades of Grey; and I didn't think I'd ever say that.  This story is about two sexual abuse survivors and how that affects their lives now.  Even though the book could stand alone and still be good, it certainly moves the story along.  I can't wait to find out what happens to Eva and Gideon next.  (Hurry and get busy, Sylvia Day.)  I've read all three books multiple times and I'm not done yet.  Love It!!
B0094M2ITG|5.0|I bought this movie ages ago and absolutely loved it. When I saw it was on streaming video, I had to boot it up to watch with my family. Great film, great story. You should watch it.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Still funny after all these years. My teenager and his friends also love it, so the humor stands the test of time.
B0095P33IW|4.0|This is the definition of 'does what it says on the tin'. I went in expecting an action film, and that was what I got. It was a fun story, well done. You should see it.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever, the physical abilities and the artistic presentation are spectacular and inspired a secondary version in my mind.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Riveting, frighteningly plausible, gut-wrenching emotion.  I wasn't expecting the reactions I had while reading this book.  You won't be disappointed.
B00000IQMT|3.0|I happen to be a fan of Star Wars music, and was very excited when this came! John Williams has definitely done a splendid job in creating new music for this movie. &#34;Duel of the Fates&#34; is definitely an all-time hit.<br />However, I was very disappointed to discover that the &#34;May the Force be with You&#34; track played when Anakin is saying good-bye to his mother somehow managed to not be in this album! Although the other music is great, I definitely miss this track.<br />Also, the organization of the tracks is a bit chaotic, and doesn't make much sense to me.
B0062QRTKA|4.0|This is a mildly entertaining game that doesn't require a great deal of skill.  While it works great on my android phone, I ran into trouble on my Kindle Fire HD on one of the higher levels.  You need to shake the device to simulate an earthquake and stop the zombies, however shaking my Kindle Fire HD didn't do anything.  It also a little awkward playing on a larger device.  I found it much easier to play on a phone rather than a tablet.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I don't know if there's any other soundtrack I listen to quite as much as this one! I don't think there's even one song on here that I don't enjoy listening to over and over. They do an incredible job of blending traditional orchestral music and techno together in a beautiful score. It certainly fits the movie very well, but it's also just great music for listening as well. Definitely comes with my highest recommendations to anyone who enjoys the soundtrack genre.
B006PIXKVW|4.0|for the first half of the movie, my 5 year old daughter cried.  I made her watch it to the end, knowing that it wouild have a good outcome (I watched it when I was a little girl).  Once she saw the ending, she asked to watch it again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use on my phone.  I'm always checking to see how much something costs or what the difference in prices are.  Not good for higher math.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Damn I still bought this album after hearing everybody saying this album was horrible and guess Wht the rumors wasn't rumors the album sucked only two hot tracks new slaves and blood on the leaves
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's entertaining enough. Good to keep kids occupied. Me too. But the original is much better. These 4 words are so I can submit. Oh,wait that was more than 4. Lol.
1476712042|3.0|So, in anticipation of the second book in this series being released, and just for the fact that all my friends said what a great book this was, I decided it was time for me to read it! Now, I am not a lover of contemporary books. Actually, I rarely give them above 3 stars. And, while I really liked this book, I still was stuck at that same rating for it. Because it was good, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't spectacular. I didn't want to rush home to it, or sneak reading it while I was at work like I do with some books. But I did find it enjoyable enough and liked the underlying theme of the storyline.<br /><br />Blurb from Goodreads:<br />Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn't drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University's Walking One-Night Stand.<br />Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby wants--and needs--to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby's resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis's apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.<br /><br />So, I must say that I truly love the cover of this book. Although, it in no way tells me anything that will happen. Nor did I understand the cover once I was done with the book. Perhaps I missed some deep underlying theme or plot line, but I don't think so. I mean, I get it, butterfly trapped in a jar = characters trapped inside themselves needing to be set free. But it just does not in any way really stick with me once I am done. It is gorgeous, tho!<br /><br />The characters in this book are hashed out fairly well. I did relate to most of them on some level or another. Although, I have to say that they all seemed much older than their freshman or sophomore years of college.<br />Abby, well, I wanted to throttle her for most of the book. She just seemed so oblivious to things. Even things that were thrown right in her face she just did not see. This was just not relatable for me. I can't see how she would not recognize such things. Other than that, I liked her character. She was very strong and independent, which is a nice change of pace for me from the younger YA characters I normally read about. She didn't take crap from anyone. She was very witty and really had a way with handling people.<br />Travis, well, he is just totally messed up. He's crazy and hot headed. But he is also fiercely loyal and loving. You can tell once he attaches himself to something, he doesn't let go. And he works at it until he is where he needs to be. So, despite him not having had any kind of real girlfriend in his life, he still had the qualities of being a decent boyfriend. But his hot headedness often got in his way. I just didn't find a lot of his actions believable as a sophomore in college. Often times I wanted to smack him in his face, other times, I wanted Abby to grab onto him and not let go.<br />America and Shep are the perfect balance to Abby and Travis. They are young and in love and actually prove to be great role models for their friends. It's nice to see young love blossoming in this book thrown against the background of stability.<br /><br />The plot is typical to me: boy meets girl, they fall for each other, but they avoid it for fear that the other won't reciprocate. It's nothing new. The way Jamie goes about it is different from other things I have read. She takes fiercely independent characters and pits them against each other. You can imagine this causes a ton of friction. McGuire keeps you on your toes throughout the whole book. You're not sure if the characters are coming or going or where they are going to end up. You certainly want a HEA, but you are not quite sure how that will happen or how the character will even get there. And, having been to college, I did not understand Travis and Shep having an apartment as a freshman and sophomore. While I know college students may live off campus, I do not know of any colleges that allow their students to live off campus as freshmen (since these kids are obviously not commuter students living at home). So this was quite unrealistic to me. Where did they get the money, besides Travis's fights? It just didn't seem real enough to me. And there was just that annoying amount of \\"insta-love\\" with Abby and travis.<br /><br />Jamie's writing is good. I did find a few flaws with pacing: some parts were very fast, some parts slow and repetitive. But for the most part it flowed well and I certainly found myself wanting to push forward to see what kind of end the characters would meet. Her use of dialogue and banter between the characters really provided a solid ground of their relationships with each other. Although, I think I would have liked to see a bit more of a background of America and Abby's relationship. I understand they are best friends, but I needed to see more of how they related to each other.<br /><br />So, all in all, I enjoyed this book more than most contemporary books I have read. I would probably put this top of my list for such books and tell my friends to read it if they like contemporary romance. Abby and Travis provide for an interesting mix. I am certainly interested in seeing how Travis's POV differs in the next book.<br /><br />3/5 stars.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|It was okay'ish. A bit disappointed that it is stretched to another book :-( And the mafia... seriously?! Hopefully book 4 won't disappoint...
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Huh...well that was...anti-climatic. Review to come...really have to think on this one. Went from 4 to 3 stars now. I just can't stand to give it more. I need to dwell a bit more. Will write this review tonight or tomorrow.<br /><br />Ok, so I am finally going to review this. I will be honest and say that it was really hard for me to rate this book. There are things that I liked about, a lot. But I think the things I didn't like about it outweighed those and it brought my rating down. It actually pains me to give this only 3 stars when I rated the first and second book so much higher. I guess I had very high hopes for this book and they were just thrown to the wind. So, let's get on with it. I will try my hardest to keep this spoiler free, but I have to say that if you have not read the first or second book you might be totally lost and you will definitely read stuff you should not know.<br /><br />Blurb from Goodreads:<br />They have tried to squeeze us out, to stamp us into the past.<br />But we are still here.<br />And there are more of us every day.<br />Now an active member of the resistance, Lena has been transformed. The nascent rebellion that was under way in Pandemonium has ignited into an all-out revolution in Requiem, and Lena is at the center of the fight.<br />After rescuing Julian from a death sentence, Lena and her friends fled to the Wilds. But the Wilds are no longer a safe haven--pockets of rebellion have opened throughout the country, and the government cannot deny the existence of Invalids. Regulators now infiltrate the borderlands to stamp out the rebels, and as Lena navigates the increasingly dangerous terrain, her best friend, Hana, lives a safe, loveless life in Portland as the fianc&eacute;e of the young mayor.<br />Maybe we are driven crazy by our feelings.<br />Maybe love is a disease, and we would be better off without it.<br />But we have chosen a different road.<br />And in the end, that is the point of escaping the cure: We are free to choose.<br />We are even free to choose the wrong thing.<br />Requiem is told from both Lena's and Hana's points of view. The two girls live side by side in a world that divides them until, at last, their stories converge<br /><br />So I'll start with the cover. To be honest, these covers with the girls face on them are just ok for me. They aren't spectacular. They give me a picture of what Lena might look like and that's about it. They tell me nothing of the story, or what is contained in the book. I would like to see something that reveals those things a bit more.<br /><br />As for the characters in this book, I don't find they are really well fleshed out. I don't find you get the depth from them that you had in the other books.<br />Now, as for Lena, I disliked her a lot in this book. She did so much growing in the second book. She became this strong, tough woman who learned to fight for what she wanted and how to protect herself. But in this book, she fell back from that, becoming a wishy washy, dependent, annoying teen who was torn between her two \\"loves\\". In all honesty, I wanted to slap her across the face for most of this book. I felt like she was trudging along hoping that things would just work out. She could not make a decision to save her life. And she didn't fight for what she wanted. In book 2 she was strong and determined, in this one she was weak and almost uncaring.<br />As for Julian and Alex, well, let's just say that you don't get much of them in the story. You get what Lena wants to show you, and it's not much. You get Lena's struggle to figure out who she should be with, when all along she knows in her heart what she wants but does not go after it. Totally frustrating and annoying. She pines away and crawls back into the shell she lived in when we read Delirium.<br />While Hana's POV was interesting, I truly found that it was not necessary to the story. I understand how the two stories collided in the end, but honestly, I didn't need to hear from Hana's POV. She brought nothing to this story for me except to fill in what seemed like what would have been empty chapters otherwise.<br /><br />I can say that I truly love Oliver's writing. It's very solid. She really knows how to put words to paper and, for the most part in this book, keep you interested in what was going on. But in all honestly, the plot was thin and fairly unmoving. Nothing grabbed me and had me saying \\"oh my goodness, I cannot put this book down!\\" I needed to know what happened in the end and that was the only thing that kept me going. I was almost disinterested in what happened to bring us to that point.<br /><br />As for the conclusion, did it answer questions, not really. It kind of just hung there having me wondering why I even read the book. There was no closure and since I know this to only be a trilogy, I can't think of why Oliver would not let it go out with a bang. It was reminiscent of Mockingjay's ending, which I thought was rushed and also left things kind of undone and unsaid. And the fact that we really got nothing about Alex in this story, well, that was really disappointing. I want to know what happened to him while he and Lena were apart. Where was the swoon worthy Alex, the one everyone fell in love with in Delirium? If you're looking for him, you won't find him in this installment. If anything, he is annoying and really made me mad for most of the book, when he even made an appearance.<br /><br />So, overall, I was totally unsatisfied with this conclusion. I am disappointed in Oliver and how she chose to end this series. It's as if she ran out of steam and focus and didn't know where to go with what she created. I missed the heart pumping thrill and overworked brain I got with the first two books. It saddens me to have to give this such a low rating. In all honesty, after talking with a few other reviewers, I almost dropped my rating to a 2, but I believe that Oliver's writing really deserves better.<br /><br />So, should you read this book? If you read the first two, it really is a must, in my opinion. I don't think you can sit back and not finish it out. However, I would go in with lower expectations than you might currently have because, much to my chagrin, this book is highly over rated by most.na's POV.

B002361MLA|5.0|This book presents quality illustrations of the one truth that will resonate with the reader who truly seeks the truth of existence, the truth of one`s self, and the power of creation.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|It's hard to do a movie about someone in a wheelchair without getting overly sentimental, schmaltzy and tugging on the heartstrings. Too often all we see is the suffering and heartbreak. This movie is all about the joy of life and how if we actually treat people like human beings no matter what state their bodies may be in and screw feeling sorry for them...well, you get a simply great movie.<br /><br />The revelation is Omar Sy as the Senegalese French guy hired by Mr. Rich Wheelchair to be his arms and legs really. The guy carries the movie by proving to be not only adept at playing humor but also the tough guy. Basically, you put Sy in any movie, I guarantee it'll be worth watching. The guy is that good.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, did I forget to mention it is a comedy. There some classic bits and the entire supporting cast is a lot of fun as well.<br /><br />As far as the extras, I leave that to someone else as my DVD copy from the library has terrible tracking problems. I, in fact, gave up, paid the $5 and watched the flick on Video On Demand in the end.

B008AZWMMG|5.0|I never really gave the band a shot. Not sure why I just assumed they were something completely different and assumed I wouldn't like them. Well a close friend of mine was telling me we should check em out and she put in the CD and skipped to this song and its like the song I've been looking for. I listened to this song on repeat for quite a few days! Love it

B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatres. The original is my favorite movie so I was very skeptical about a prequel. Although I am not a fan of James Franko (RDJ would have been fantastic) the movie is quite good. They did a good job presenting the genesis of the wizard.
B00CWVFZ8W|3.0|I am one who likes to read a novel before seeing the movie, needless to say I puchased this first on amazon in kindle form as a novel. After reading said novel I chose to wait to see the movie on dvd form. I just got the feeling I would not  want towaste my money at thebox office. You know what I was right. So see the movie, but read the book for the full effect! I also chosenot to finish reading the series BEAUTIFUL CREATURES.  This wasa personal decision, based on how I felt after reading the first book. For me it truly is a young adult, maybe even pre-teen novell. I wasn't too entranced by the content, it just didn't transcend to an adult level, and I don't think it was supposed to. I was disappointed in the acting from the leading male role, he just didn't come across that well developed inthe movie. I am sure many teen and tweens however will enjoy both movie, and book series.
030758836X|2.0|Snarky and cynical throughout. Left me feeling awful. Unlikeable, nasty characters, lacks nobility. Do not recommend unless you enjoy being depressed.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Great cast and that they all played many parts was intriguing. Good plot a little confusing at first but caught on fast and was totally into the story.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard but not easy. It makes you think and be very perceptive. Fun and addicting and not very frustrating.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game to keep you busy. Really forces you to think creatively! Great for developing problem solving skills.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked the 50 shades of Grey trilogy, you will love this trilogy. All of these books sort of have the same pattern. I enjoyed every second of it.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|This app is quite a bit of fun. The ability to draw beautiful rendered art with finger Strokes is quite an innovative feature. My device wallpaper has been replaced with a saved rendering from this app.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|My eyes never left this book. I loved it! The crossifre trilogy is such a great, hot, intense and romantic trilogy. Can't wait for the rest of the books!
B008IZYW3U|5.0|If you are any kind of Freddie Mercury fan at all, you MUST own this CD.  Even if you have the original Barcelona CD (as I do) you will not want to be without this musical jewel in your library.  When I found out about this 2012 remake with a full orchestra I got very curious and thought, &#34;just how different can this be?&#34;  I was blown away!!  The orchestration is tremendous and even the vocals are clearer and crisper.  I will even go as far to say that if you close your eyes while listening, it is almost like being at a live performance.  I know, strong claim, but true.  It is like Freddie has come to life and once again joined the great Montserrat Caballe.  There are also two bonus tracks not on the original.CD.  The first is an extended version of &#34;How Can I Go On&#34; incorporating a beautiful violin accompaniment by David Garrett and if you are a Queen fan, Roger Taylor's son Rufus, also makes contributions on the drums.  The second bonus track is the song that Freddie composed for his first meeting with Montserrat Caballe , &#34;Exercises in Free Love&#34;.  This is Freddie's original vocal recording in a spot on soprano falsetto so that Montserrat could hear it performed in her vocal range.  You need to buy this CD! You will not be disappointed!
B00COHIFQS|5.0|wow movie scared me a couple times had me and wife jumping while viewing now thats what a good horror movies are all about would recommend renting or owning to any one
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Easy to download and install into my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Set it up in no time and works well with my HP 5520 printer.
B00CWVFPGO|3.0|had its moment typical arnold movie kill blow up destroy by the terminator --recommend waiting till hits cable or netflix or amazon prime to view at no cost
B001GMQALY|5.0|This was an amazing movie so sensual and hot wow this is my favorite movie.  No other movie could compare.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun play, enjoyable music more than just a hidden object. I would have liked for it to be a little longer. I do appreciate that there was no in ap purchasing.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Loved it.  I loved it so much that I bought another copy for my son.  He too loved it.  Thanks!
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|If you need a way to keep a toddler quiet for 15-30 min, this app might do it. Kept me quiet for about as long, as well. Now, I'm hungry.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Haven't watched it yet.  Heard it was a good movie.  i bought a copy for myself and another for my son.
B00A11AN6O|3.0|Not that sociable, don't take a lot of pictures of people, things, though I do snag the<br />occasional photo for sketching, etc.<br /><br />So, haven't actually used the thing, would love to have all this add-on crap be something<br />that could easily be removed from &#34;my&#34; phone.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Movies were made for entertainment and this movie did just that.  It had the highs and the lows of the main characters  life and it showed what kind of things we do when our heads are not on straight. We all do things we wish we could change.  Movies are a good way to laugh at ourselves.  If you like comedy, don't miss this one.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|Can't say good or bad, and it's personal, but I really don't do much in the way of mobile shopping.
0739384171|5.0|I liked Book 2 better than Book 1.  I couldn't put &#34;Played with Fire&#34; down.  I started and stopped a few times with &#34;Dragon Tattoo&#34; which was a surprise to me actually.  Lisbeth a very &#34;modern&#34; hero in difficult times.  The &#34;complicated&#34; hero.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I can understand how everyone want to make money off of things.<br /><br />But the whole splintering of things, just gets to the point of being annoying.  Go to Itunes for this, Amazon for that, who knows whoever is going to come with the next new service.  Same for video, Warner Brothers apparently pulling videos from Netflix, to form their own service.<br /><br />If they're going to &#34;DRM&#34; things, then there should be the equivalent of a DRM clearing house.  If I &#34;buy&#34; an album, then that album should be able to check in and let me listen to the thing irrespective of what I'm using online to listen to it.  (Idealistic, but then hey, why not wish for the moon?).<br /><br />Plus, until recently I only had a 3G phone with limited data plans, so what was the point.<br /><br />And of course speakers on phones suck.<br /><br />So, Music?<br /><br />I do Pandora and several other streaming services, but see no need for yet another &#34;source&#34; of music.<br /><br />I have bought music through Amazon's MP3 Service.  And other than the poorly documented, confusing interface (downloading), it worked okay.  But even then, nothing that I would stream directly via an app.<br /><br />I really like having it simple, all music coming from pretty much one place.<br /><br />So so so....<br /><br />If you use it, more power to you.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Lots of detail in a very long book. Focus moves from one character to the next and back again, and an intricate story is woven.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Works fine on my Kindle Fire and HD.  I know the power level at a glance.  Good app at a good price.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|We liked it so much we watched it twice. Although animated it's not just a kid's movie. My wife and I are both retired and we enjoyed every minute of it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Even though I a senior citizen, I enjoy playing games on my Kindle Fire.  This one is easy to play and addictive.  I think I got a lot more done before the electronic age.
B00C7DGQ9C|5.0|it was what I had expected it to be, a fun movie to watch I will watch it again and I don't say that about to many movies
B007N8RULO|4.0|Even though I a senior citizen, I enjoy playing games on my Kindle Fire.  This one is easy to play and addictive.  I think I got a lot more done before the electronic age.
B001MSMUH0|5.0|insightful, revolutionary and thought provoking.  Depressing to think of how daunting a task it is to overhaul our education system.  As a parent it changed my thinking in where to encourage my children to focus their time and efforts.  To give them wings to fly not burdens to carry.
B008Y768XO|5.0|First of all I love the streaming video.  It was late I wanted to see a movie and I love dogs... so this was perfect solution for me.  If you love dogs or are loved by a dog this is the movie for you.  I had heard the story of Hachi, and they did a great job telling it with this adaptaion.  Yes I cried, cried, cried thru the last third of the movie ... and I even knew what was coming!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I loved the book.  Took forever to read and I skipped some of the historical descriptive sections.  The author is brilliant in how he weaves together a story to encompass history, philosophy and religion.
B008MM9630|4.0|Love this game.  The only problem so far is that you must watch how close you put items next to each other.  It makes it difficult to collect.  I'd like more animals for be available without using crystals.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|play until you cant play any more and then play some more! great game and great graphics. keep on playingsome moree
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I loved it and would love to buy it instead of downloading it all the time. You will love it, you'll see.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|I would enjoy it more if I could adjust my speed. The developers are losing out on a group of people who might play the game but don't have the dexterity required to play successfully.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome  game just love playing can't wait to play more of this game it totally rocks everyone should play u all will love it
B005L38QHA|1.0|they made the main left and right click too wide and it is very hard to spread ur fingers wide enough to be comfy. other than that the this is okay
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It's midnight and I had to stay up to finish this book. If that tells you anything - it's so compelling!  A great read.
B008X9Z37A|1.0|I have purchased the leather case for my wife and the Belkin for myself trying to save some money.  Well I saved the money but just ordered another leather case and will put the belkin in the trash can.  No holes for speakers, does not turn off when the case is closed and the 4 straps that hold it in on the corners are cheap and won't last long.  Also, it doesn't fold and allow you hands free operation.  Belkin definitely needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.  Would not recommend to anyone.  If you can't afford the leather model, don't buy a case.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Would recommend to anyone who likes movies with a quirky, but thought provoking plot.  Peter Sellers is great, also.  A good film for your collection
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I thought this book was simply just ok. I judge a books worth by how much work I get done around my house while I'm reading it. If my house is dirty, it's because I can't tear myself away from my book. It took me over two weeks to read this one and my house was pretty clean the whole time. A lot of teen fiction is good enough and mature enough for adult readers. I think this one should be left for the teenage girls. They'd love it.
B00004XPPE|3.0|The scene missing from this edition shows the control room and a small wisp of smoke coming from the computer bank.  One airman accuses the other of smoking while on duty.  They leave the room.  There was a failure in the computer room, and that caused the fail safe mechanism to fail.  Without that scene, the edition is lacking.
B004X75RK4|5.0|I love how Ryan and Sandra interact in this movie. Their is comedy among an unfolding love/like relationship for one another. Thisovie is one of my favorites!!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Amazing movie...I usually dislike musicals but after a few minutes of this amazing film...you forget it's even a musical...it's a wonderful tapestry...recording perfectly one changed man's life.  Music becomes breathtaking in Ann Hathaways pinnacle song...once of the best movies I've eve seen!
B007D2XSW0|3.0|It is OK and that says it all. You can get the job done with it but is it the best a photo editor can do. I don't think so.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Fun fun fun. Played other versions and this rocks. So many new ways to get higher scores.warming you will get addicted and lose track of time
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I am only just now starting to play match 3 games, and I have to say that I really like this one. I didn't like the fact that the puzzles are timed, though. I thought they were kind of easy at first, but the puzzles do get progressively harder. Give you a hint...they are timed, and one of the last ones gives you 35 minutes to complete it. Not so easy... I also can't figure out how to finish the final puzzle.<br /><br />Anyway, graphics are spectacular on my Samsung Galaxy SII with Jelly Bean. The sound and voice are nice, but I turn those off, and the play is really smooth. If you like these types of games, then I would get it.<br /><br />***Side Note***  I didn't have any problems downloading the game like others have said, but I have noticed that I have downloading AMAZON apps at certain times. I will check and see if I can download games from Google Play and it will work fine, so it's not my phone or your device, it is Amazon.<br /><br />Also, if you have any phone that is NOT rooted, and is NOT a Samsung Galaxy S4, AND you will NOT be getting updated to Jelly Bean, then you should read the following article regarding an exploit that is out and has not been patched. Any apps that you get through Amazon is possibly exploited, and all of your apps including system apps can be destroyed. Please read the following article from Android Central. [...]
B008IJT0CE|5.0|there are so many different sounds to choose from depending on if you want to fall asleep or just relax. the layering and volume adjustment is a great feature and also the ability to put a timer on to close the app automatically.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The entire series is awesome I enjoyed book 1 loved book 2 this had a little too much sex for me....can't wait for book4.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|great read  got a little crazy at the end the author needs to keep it more realistic  some of it was crazy  read it for yourself
B00AR83PN4|4.0|This game is retro with a twist. All the reviews complaining about the font or color choice don't seem to get this.  The only way the color choice could make it difficult to play the game is with the yellow and gold blocks,  which is probably why people have been complaining that their matches aren't always disappearing ( though one of them contains glimmers of white, which could maybe help you to tell the difference).Other than that, to address the other concerns, the leaderboards do, in fact, work if you have an amazon gamecircle account. Finally, the controls are completely responsive and easy. Some people may just feel uncomfortable with these controls, but you can get used to it.  But overall, this is a fun, entertaining game with some solid features.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I was very pleased with this story line and purchased a copy for a family member after seeing the film.  I have watched it over and over again and see each time something of &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; from a different slant.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The icons or game cube pictures are rather small so If you don't see well this could be a problem.  It is fun to just waste  time with.  Becomes boring after a while.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I CAUGHT A FEW DAYS OF THIS SERIES SOME MONTHS AGO AND COULD NOT WAIT FOR THIS VIDEO TO WATCH THE COMPLETE SERIES.  IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER
B0034G4P80|5.0|\\"Thor\\" is a unique film involving the headstrong and powerful characters of Thor and his brother Loki (creatively played by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston). Thor becomes instrumental in the goal to save nine worlds (including earth).  The plot of the story starts to build when Thor gets sent to earth by his father. The following actors and actresses are among those of multiple characters who also play significant parts in the film: Natalie Portman, Idris Elba, Anthony Hopkins, and Stellan Skarsgard. \\"Thor\\" is definitely good for those who like fantasy films that are family friendly.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Once again I am a winner in selecting this item.  Watched it again and again.  Good story line and keep me interested.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|No other series I've ever watched has been able to keep up the storyline and increase your interest.<br /><br />Downton Abbey keeps getting better through time
6300248569|5.0|I have purchased different versions of Pride and Prejudice to view how each is interpreted. I am very, very satisfied.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|I liked it very much. Very well written, especially considering it is a debut novel,  keeps you reading on. I am waiting for the next installment in these series.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Good historical information on a topic not widely known in an easy to read format.  Not at all what I expected.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|No matter how many times I see it, it never gets old...<br /><br />It looks and sounds great!<br /><br />(used as a test in my surround sound set up)
B00BU987C8|5.0|I'll make it short and to the point....when you have hip hop luminaries like Dre, Andre 3000, Big Boi, Game and others backing you...how can you go wrong? If you're a true hip hop fan-get this album!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very nice little esacpe game. not too long or hard. took less than ten minutes. graphics were great. look forward to the next one.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I first read this book in 1980, and it literally changed my life! It is still my guide to the way I want to live my life.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|My rental locked up during the movie and I could not restart it despite trying it on 3 computers. Netfix did work as that is the next thing I tried.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|Dr. CAROL DWECK is respected in the education community- Mindset can be used across different profession platforms: corporate America, small business, educational leadership, selfreflective practices,find a solution...it is my best professional read all summer!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my most favorite game in the whole world. I can build whatever I want and do whatever i want. Sadly the updates take for ever to release to amazon but i can wait because it is a good game.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|It is a lot fun. My son who is special needs love it as well. Only dislike is when you want to redo a hole it does take some figuring out
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|This Movie is great I liked the plot in the theater so I ordered it as soon as I could for home viewing. I'm not going to give away anything about how the movie ends up though. Great Romance movie!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It is a wonderful app to have, it makes it very easy to keep your system cleaned of junk, cache and such.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Good book but the ending was a little hokey and rushed though. I liked the historical aspect of the book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was very good, when you start playing it you never want it to end!!!! I highly recommend this game to you
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was very happy with season 3. Got to meet some of the American relatives. Good casting with Shirley McClain. Pissed me off about the death in the family. BUT, I look forward to season 4. Worth the watch.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|subway surf is good and a very attractive game for people<br />But very hard  to collect keys that's the only bad thing<br />That is bad about it the rest is ok that's why I rate it four star<br />Thank You for creating subway surf its like the same as temple run<br />But more interesting I am playing it very often now.<br />Thank You
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game I recommend it to anyone who loves games that you take care of animals and horse lovers
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A wonderful read!  Unique &  fun!  If you enjoy fantasy & being different you need to read this book!  It's a great read!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I am not on facebook, so it is a bit more difficult to get to the next level when you can't ask friends for help.
0062103377|5.0|I've only began reading this, but I already love it. I've seen every episode of Supernatural(twice) and so far, this book is accurate. It's extremely well-written and the writer catches Bobby's character perfectly. I highly recommend this for any supernatural lover.
0307474275|2.0|I've never understood what all the fuss was about this book. I found it to be poorly written, cheesy, and juvenile -- not to mention boring. I was so bored that I stopped reading about 20 pages from the end.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game is fairly easy to complete.  Would be nice to have a hint button. Ready for more levels.<br />Xxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Xxxxxx. Xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Xxxxxxxxxxx.  Xxxxxxxxx.  Xxxxx.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Two Graves seems not to live up to previous PENDERGAST NOVELS.  Too slow getting to the action.  PENDERGAST  almost seems like a different person than in earlier books.  Are the authors running out of interest him?  Let's get back to the PENDERGAST of  Still Life with Crows.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a great game to have. It freezes on a fair occasion but usually it is fine. Like this game because it switches places for example, Miami to Paris if it is a holiday it goes to holidays for example Easter. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to buy it it is a great quality fan that everybody should enjoy.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|It is an ok game.  Challenges the mind a little bit.  My son like the boxes when they blow up.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults!!! My three year old son loves this movie. It is a  movie with adult humor in it as well so people of all ages can enjoy it :)
B005F2BBLK|4.0|Interesting movie.  Not to sure how well it will work for little kids.  More adult oriented based on some slightly dark scenes.  Oh and the snake of course.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|The beginning seemed really slow to me. The black and white part was SO dull that I almost turned it off before we got to technicolor Oz. Glad I stuck it out. I watched this movie with just my husband but I know my kids (ages 10,11) will be in awe over the visual sweeps of the land of Oz and the great characters. SPOILER ALERT: When Mila Kunis turned into who we know as the green Wicked Witch of the West, that was a mind-blower! The transformation was...WICKED! They did a wonderful job making Munchkinland look and feel like the classic, just better cinematography. James Franco played a great wizard, and Michelle Williams shined as the beautiful Glinda. You can't help but fall in love with the little porcelain doll and the little monkey who befriend the Wizard on his quest. It was a really great prequel to the original. It started out slow, but we give it a solid 4 stars for visual awesomeness and staying true to the original. Great cast, great imagery.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love these books and I am anxious to read Number 3.  The only thing that was sometimes difficult was keeping track of who was who.  Other than that great book!
B001A4LYN2|5.0|A really good movie. Lives up to the hype. Not for children. The main character is so politely sinister. Pretty graphic violence in some parts.
B000V8A95C|5.0|After seeing the actual musical I wanted the music. The music is amazing, the words are phenomenal!!!!!! Love, love, Love it!!!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This movie is great...if you're in a fraternity or if you're an overgrown, immature, pot-smoke belching , man-child.  Ladies, or any adult who doesn't get a kick out of lazy, obnoxious frat boys with Peter-Pan syndrome---don't bother. Sadly, my husband LOVED it. Thought it was hilarious. Now every time it storms I have to endure &#34;F you thunder, you can suck my #@#$, blahblahblah, cuz youre just god's farts&#34; followed by a real fart of his own. Yeah, i'm serious.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|this movie gives you more than just boxing. It is very touching movie Father and son get to know each other through boxing the robots are cool I hope that they make another movie. I will tell all my friends to buy the movie
0440246008|5.0|If you are going to be a successful mystery writer like Lee Childs there are certain basic rules the genre demands. First, first impressions are for the purpose of misdirecting the reader. Second, character, bad character, cannot never be totally subdued. Third, bad characters ultimately act in character. And finally have a protagonist like Jack Reacher, who never looks for trouble but trouble always finds him.<br /><br />I am catching up on Lee Childs and Jack Reacher, a series I overlooked for far too long. Although I am not reading the sequence in order, Reacher is virtually a standalone character.<br /><br /> Reacher is having coffee in Manhattan when a ransom is delivered for the wife and daughter of a mercenary-supplying entrepreneur. He soon finds himself as a member of the assembled \\"A\\" team of ex-British and American special ops pros. Reacher, as an ex-MP major, is about more than muscle and soon he is the lead investigator in the absence of any police or FBI presence.<br /><br />In Lee Child's universe we learn that things aren't often what they seem, and the kidnappers are adept at staying one step ahead of every one. This is precisely the way it should be. Reacher is the prefect superhero for a cast of mercenaries and models. The Hard Way was hard to put down.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Pretty good so far... hope it's a long game. Graphics are good, typical of g5, some of the rooms seem very familiar to past games.
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|THE HELP has become one of my all-time favorite books and movies (and audiobook, for that matter).  I believe it will be considered a classic someday.  That being said, I was in for a bad surprise when I ordered the DVD.  First of all, there is an incredible amount of &#34;blank screen&#34; between DVD sections (i.e., menu, previews, required anti-copy &#34;warning&#34;, actual movie, etc.) which cannot be fast-forwarded.  I don't mind these required non-movie pieces and directions, but the &#34;wait&#34; for The Help was interminable!  Then, in the middle of the movie, the DVD simply stopped.  It was a corrupt disc, I guess.  My player worked fine on any other DVD I put in it.  I wanted to play the rest of the movie so badly (for my mother-in-law, her only chance to see it) that I ran out to Wal-Mart and bought another copy!  Same long wait between sections, but at least it played the whole movie.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I'm a huge fan of this author and was so excited to read And the Mountains Echoed. The prose, as always, was lush, the descriptions rich, and the characters engaging. Heartfelt and real, the book draws you in and takes you on a journey through family, history, love, and loss. I only give it four stars because the author lost me for a little while when the plot shifted to two cousins as adults. It was hard to remember who they were and both their characters felt rushed. Otherwise, a fabulous read.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I just wanted to throw my name in along with all the others who truly enjoyed this book.  I came across it accidentally a few years ago - I had not heard any hype about it.  I was enthralled.  If you are looking for a good summer read, or just a good read in general, this is it.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I don't read a lot of YA, but this book gripped me. I cried, I hoped, I prayed. This was love in all it's beauty, pain, and glory.<br /><br />After a terrible car accident, seventeen year old Mia is forced to choose between life and death. Recounting her life, loves, and aspirations, she incites our sympathy and makes us root for her, regardless of her decision. Highly recommended.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Action packed kept me entranced till the very last word. I will miss the world of Sookie Stackhouse. The end.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It was a good read. Maybe someone who feels hopeless about their past can find hope in someone who can overcome fifty shades of F-ed up
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun. Not too easy or hard to play. Enjoyable way to pass the time. I would enjoy playing more levels.

B007VDN1PA|5.0|Had problems with the first one I received. However, the support people at DBTECH were awesome and sent me a new unit promptly. Am impressed with how well it works, including on old slides that you can hardly see light through.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one of my fav shows, smart and realistic to the real world. I would recommend this show to anyone
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I really liked the pilot episode they did with NCIS so when I saw this was going to be an actual series that was picked up, I knew it would be good.  Chris O'Donnell plays a perfect part as G. Callen who is the lead investigator.  LL Cool J who I'm a fan of his music, has also shown he is a very accomplished actor in the few movies I've seen him in (The Hardway, Halloween H20, SWAT) also plays a very believable and likable former Navy Seal named Sam Hanna.  Linda Hunt as the &#34;boss&#34; or the &#34;mind&#34; of the squad is really a wonderful and mysterious character, and she is quite funny.  I remember her as the principal in Kindergarten Cop and see her as this federal agency &#34;secret weapon&#34; or sorts, is just really cool.  I own all 4 seasons and I really love all the episodes.  The first season, has a lot of great episodes and you really can relate and like the characters very quickly.  Once you finish season 1, you'll want to jump right into season 2.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Best TV show ever.  I didn't even see it until it had been cancelled for two years and it still makes me mad to think about it.  If you don't buy this set, one day you will hate yourself for it.  Do the right thing.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|It's beautiful!  I love that you can change colors along with changing between just drawing a line and having it continue to draw after you put your line in.........I also love the fact that you can save the ones you like and then make them into your wallpaper!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I bought this for a friend for his birthday and he just raves about it.  We were over to their house last night for the 4th of July and he had it playing the whole night.  My husband said we needed to get it.
B009O07NMA|5.0|My girlfriend is in love with these guys, I don't care much for county music but even I enjoy this cd
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|It's a really well-done app. In fact it's so easy to use that sometimes I use it for a quick check rather than the computer
B000002B5L|5.0|Brought back memories from the old days,although some of the songs and lyrics are very explicit. The Fugees songs addresses many social concerns, particularly those issues and ills affecting African americans and minorities
B006HL9G10|5.0|You are able to create your own meditation sequence ; adjust the sounds in whatever tone and time sequences you want. It's  an exceptionally well done app.
B00000ADG2|5.0|The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill is a work that address many social issues and concerns. Her songs carry lots weight and is prophetic and empowering!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|For two decades,I've been waiting for this group to get their s*** together!Finally,QUEENSRYCHE have released a recording worth listening too since Empire! I've been into this group since the Summer of 83, saw them at their prime(L'amours{East & West}), Radio City Music Hall, and the Meadowlands!Those were the days, and now I'm looking forward to catch this lineup in the near future. Congrats and Welcome back to Metal Glory, boys. \m/ \m/
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Awesome! This is the 1st movie we have bought on Blu-ray. Wowwww!! Totally fantastic! We'll never go back to normal dvd,s.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft pe always have but it is a little slow on updates unlike my I phone but it is still my favorite app ever buy this app at any price u should try it too
B00493E1GI|5.0|The movie was very good and meaningful. It's a movie that can provide knowledge and wisdom. It can also put one on the path to their personal happiness. Watch it. It will enlighten you.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Was not the best work syivia day has done. I looked forward for this book to come out and I was disappointed
B00881VLCE|5.0|love the puzzles. they are the vividest puzzles only wish there where more free puzzles to download. it keeps. my busy for hours. I really enjoy them. need more Ann getty puzzles. if you like. puzzles. you will enjoy this app
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app for passing time while watching a slow moving sport like golf.Years ago, I spent most of my work day on the phone talking with clients. Solitude was my way to live through long spells on hold.
1558908382|5.0|Not your typical rom-com, if you can even call it that. Probably my favorite character that Cusack has done. Minnie Driver is superb, angry and sarcastic and vulnerable all at the same time somehow. Great movie.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|words cannot describe how much awesomeness is in this series. Very unique and the cliff hangers make you want to watch the entire season all at once!
B00005JM20|4.0|Great 007 parody, possibly better than 007 movies in the sense that it doesn't take itself seriously yet keeps a slick, engaging plot that Rowan somehow fits into with his comedic persona.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book brings the themes of courage, growing up and acceptance to a fresh.  original, and readable story line. It is brilliant.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Much better than season six, the characters evolved more, keeping you on the edge of your seat continuously. One of my Top 5 TV series ever.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|I think this product is way overpriced for what you get.  Basically its lego in various shades of green and brown in the flat 1x1 squares.  Absolutely not worth the high cost.  The box is very small ~ 4&#34; square so it was not an impressive gift when wrapped.  The thrill value from my grandchild is the only reason this product got 3 stars from me.
B000002B2T|5.0|This album is mesmerizing, Lane sounds tormented and near delirious at times, but it works for the genre. It's sad to lose a guy like that.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I have played with this and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was easy to figure out and fascinating to see what can be done.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Urban made a very good turn as Dredd, evoking Stallone the entire film. Great cinematography, grim and bleak but very effective.
0345529057|5.0|The &#34;Song of Ice and Fire&#34; series is fantastic collection of books. The book series is high fantasy, but eases you into their world of magic very slowly, at first the books are hyper-realistic political thrillers, then the series evolves into a Character-Driven epic with dozens of beautifully fleshed-out characters.<br /><br />This series has the most in-depth characters, history, and world, than any other series I have ever read or seen on television.<br /><br />I recommend sampling the first book; you'll know if you like it by the third chapter. The rest of the series is great.
B004EPZ00C|4.0|Slick production, wonderful settings and locations, fun all around. It's a must for any Rowan Atkinson fan and Gillian Anderson with her British accent....worth it.
1616550414|5.0|This book was fantastic, because I have been a fan of the Legend of Zelda series. I will say, however, that this collection focuses heavily on Skyward Sword, which may be a turn-off for a few Zelda fans looking for more coverage of other great Zelda games. Still a lot of fun, I am glad I did not spend more than $25 though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|don't be fooled. this game is much cooler and more fun than one hundred floors. that is, if u like a challenge.
6305882592|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Completely dated.  Stupid, insipid, implausible.  Poorly written, with a hackneyed score by Cat Stevens.  A truly complete waste of time.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|If you have never heard the music of Melody Gardot, or even if you have, this album—which is truly an homage to the beautiful sounds of Brazil—is a feast for the ears. Her music wraps itself around you, dares you to fall in love, and takes you on a musical journey that is simply marvelous. Obrigado, Melody!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fantastic game can't put it down!!! Love the animations. Fun for young kids. Really creative. Always lots to do everyday!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My awesome SIL recommended this show to me, and I'm so glad she did!  Interesting characters, engaging plots and visually...just breathtaking!! I think I'd watch it for the clothes alone, but they are really just the icing to a very delicious cake!
0736092269|5.0|Frederic Delavier has done an excellent job, love the illustrations, makes it real easy to know exactly what muscles you are working on and how.  Rec'd in excellent condition.
B00C4QD5IW|5.0|I have rented this many times and was so glad that it was finely available to purchase. Beautifully filmed period film. A timeless story. I watch it often, I'm glad I own it.
0684857219|5.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger is Arnold Schwarzenegger!  He is a master of building muscle, he is a master in life, and it shows in the organization and detail that went into putting this Encyclopedia together.  Rec'd in excellent condition.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found this game to be interesting yet not  so difficult to be frustrating. I can't wait for more levels.
B000OLRH10|5.0|I love this movie because it really makes you wonder why we are willing to do so much for the things we want. Not only that, how easy it is to forget about where the things we love are coming from. I've never been a fan of buying diamonds, and even less so after I watched this film.<br /><br />Very powerful movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best ever. Would like 100 seasons now. My husband loves it also.  We advised all of our friends to watch the show.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Game is addictive easy to catch on to. My only problem is that it doesn't always let me connect to Facebook to send help or get help from others playing
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game is very addictive.  yes it can be annoying to wait to collect pearls rather than spend money to buy them quickly, but its especially interesting to browse other reefs and see how other players have designed their space. and it is a nice way to relax.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter found this and we read favorable reviews,so we downloaded it. She has really enjoyed it .The graphics are fun and there is always something to do.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought this book for my kindle because I was curious. I kind of got bored with the story about halfway through and just haven't gotten back to it. Christian's character is really unlikable in my opinion and I get really annoyed with him. The other characters are not likeable either really. It is not very well written in my opinion. I will probably pass on getting the next two.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I am just slightly put off by the fact that these kids are in high school and are doing the stuff they are, so I just pretend like they're actually in college and I can watch happily :).
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|CANT WAIT FOR SEASON 2<br />GOOD STORY LINE,ACTING EXCELLENT<br />WOULD LIKE TO SEE OF GILLIAN ANDERSON<br />VERY CREEPY AND SCARY
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is a great app for any Magic: The Gathering fan, You have to pay $10 to unlock the full game but it is worth it, you get more opponents in campaign and multiplayer.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Story line is very good.  Each week the writing continues to be insightful about ethics and laa practices.<br />The characters are very believable and continue to be engaging.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|An album my 25 year old daughter and I can agree on in the car!  Thoughtful lyrics, intriguing tunes and a good balance of lively and laid back  beats.
B0040I09RM|3.0|Not to mention a few good looking guys scattered throughout.<br />Hey, I'm a tough sell though ... Reality vs. Entertainment ...  All the chaos, all the time? Really? LOL And no way THAT many people have SO MUCH info.<br />Like I said, it's decent entertainment, if you can keep up with the chaos.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I read the book first and thought this would be a great way to review book 1 before moving on to book 2. Now, I almost want to see season 2 before reading the book but I will wait until I have finished the 2nd book. Peter Dinklage is great as are Emilia Clarke, Aidan Gillen, and Sean Bean. I was sorry to see Ned go in the book and more so in the movie..
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing! I liked the way it switched back and forth between Lena's present and past. I was so into the book it only took me about 4 days to read it all (it would've been 3 but I had other stuff to do.) Anyway, I felt like I was right there with Lena. I almost felt her pain every time she would get hurt. When I got to the end, I was shocked (I'm not going to spoil it for anyone). So, if you've read the first one, you've got to read this sequel because it was really good. The only thing is what most people say about the one after this one, Requiem. I haven't read that one yet, but based on the reviews I've read many people aren't happy with how that one ends.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Reads as well as the first two.  Ordered for my kindle and am pleased with it.  Racy, definitetly not meant for children.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|hill climb racing is a great game to play on a rainy day these game is a five stars all ways
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Signed up for prime so we could watch season three after watching one and two on demand.  Really enjoy this show!
B001JIES4Q|5.0|This movie is not like others I have seen. It portrays the real workings and pains of love. It shows the hard work and commitment that you must give to love. It was not all happy endings but it left me with  a more real view of real love.
B00B2064IY|4.0|If u love jimi like I do, you will love this album.it's bluesy, rough and a joy to own.  I listen to it whenever I'm on . My kindle.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I LOVE THE GAME JETPACK JOYRIDE. IT IS A RIOT TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS AND I PLAY IT WHEN EVER I HAVE FREE TIME.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 is not my favorite season. With all that happens, how can it be? But it is still Downton with the familiar characters we all still love! I do like in this season they get out and see a bit more of things, so the scenery changes. I will say the UK version season 3 ending is a bit less harsh and easier to watch. I was not looking forward to watching the season finale again. But this version is.... softer I guess!  No matter what Downton is still my favorite show ever.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Good Book, wish it would have told more of the story though, and waiting almost a year to get a few more pieces of the puzzle, not impressed after waiting for almost 6 months for this book. But it was good, now to wait for the next book...no ETA on that yet!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Downloaded this game for my daughter she loves it. My son also likes it. Good to keep them busy on rainy days.
034580404X|4.0|I enjoyed the trilogy; I identified w Christian in more than just the Dom-Sub area, and I thought the Ana character was pretty damn realistic and consistent throughout.  After about 1/2 way through the second book, I thought the story lost some of the tension and conflict present up to that point, and the trilogy ended a little too &#34;fairy tale&#34; for me.  All in all though, the books were good and a very fun read.
0425263916|4.0|It was a very good book.  Although there were similarities to Fifty Shades, it does have a different twist on it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have played Spider Solitaire on my computer for several years. It is now so convenient to have it on my Kindle so it can go with me wherever I go.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This story is so good. Eva has a lot more patience than me when it comes to Gideon and his past thought. Can wait for the next book!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Excellent. A remarkable work of imagination. Warmly recommended for readers of all ages. But ... What really happened to Marco and Celia?
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Like many fans of the first three movies, I was extremely disappointed with Len Wiseman's handling of \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" and I allowed myself a glimmer of hope regarding \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" upon learning it would be rated R. Owing to its low-teens Rotten Tomatoes score, I refused to hand over my money during this travesty's limited, embarrassing theatrical run. Months later I could not help myself from renting it OnDemand one brutally hot July evening, six years and one day after John McClane saved us from traffic jams and the digital draining of US wealth by hackers in an 18-wheeler. I realize this review is not for LFODH, but I want to convey how low my expectations were for AGDTDH. Ninety eight minutes later I sat disgusted with everyone involved in this production, as well as myself for spending any money whatsoever watching this poorly written, poorly shot, poorly acted, poorly directed, and poorly conceived heap of glass and helicopter parts.<br /><br />We all enjoyed the original, landmark \\"Die Hard.\\" We were slightly bemused by the naked karate scene in the otherwise solidly entertaining \\"Die Harder,\\" and then we were 100 percent back in the game \\"With a Vengeance.\\" Then McClane jumped on an F-35 and had his trademark quip censored, and we all wanted the man to go out with the dignity that he deserved after saving hundreds in LA, thousands in Washington, DC, and all of our money at the New York Federal Reserve. Dignity is not to be had in AGDTDH- not for McClane, his son, or us, the viewers and fans of this once iconic franchise. This movie is absolutely atrocious. Save your money, your time, and your tears. Only John McTiernan could possibly help give McClane one last good outing, but I suspect he would rather stay in prison than be associated with the follow-up to A Good Day to Die Hard, which is a horrible film and the worst Die Hard movie. The only winner is Len Wiseman.
0802473156|5.0|Its a good book to read whether you're in a marriage or just starting to date. I highly recommend it.
B00CMEQD30|1.0|I'm not sure if this novel was self published or not.  I doubt it was ever reviewed and commented on by an editor .
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Lots of great reading and understanding about my favorite subject: Creating your reality. Will reread again!<br />Very easy to understand and practice the principles set forth in the book.
B009MO5960|4.0|This was another in the long line of Resident Evil sequels. Not as well done as the previous entries but still quite entertaining and good enough to make me look forward to the next.
B000001F76|5.0|Listening to Hank Williams CD the sound is very goodand I may order some more CD in the future. Thank You  Joe
0671449028|5.0|This is our 5th Sandra Boynton book and is one of my daughter's favorites! It's not just the trademark Boynton artwork that is cute but the story itself. Its also an easy and fun read. I would definitely gift this one to my nieces and nephews...a hearty thumbs up!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Pink fluffly unicorns dancing on rainbows. I love minecraft pocket edition soooooooooooooooo much. This app needs to have 10stars instead of 5 but 5 is the highest one you can rate so yeah I love pinkie pie and my little pony.<br />Minecraft pocket edition if you don't have it get it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!<br />!!!!!!!!#!
B0032FPVKE|4.0|This bag has enough room for a small point and shoot pocket size camera plus extra accessories.<br />A larger low end digital SLR will fit snugly in the main compartment, but there is not any room for a large amount of accessories left over.<br />There is a small zippered pocket for extra memory cards and maybe a few batteries.<br />I like that it has a handle and a removable shoulder strap.<br />If you need a small grab and go bag this one will give you what you are looking for.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Worked Great. Follow the instructions exactly. More paste than required negates its cooling properties. I learned the hard way. Don't you.
0679805273|5.0|We bought this book for my Kindergarten daughter. She took to her teacher at the end of the year to have her sign. I am PLANNING to have her do the same with all of her teachers as she moves through her education. She has me read to her the sweet personal message her teacher wrote over and over again! Worth the purchase for that alone!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|for a free app this is an amazing game. I would've bought it if it cost money. way better than the first game. and constantly changing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a very interesting show, I like the scenery, the wardrobe and the acting is very good. I can't wait for the next season.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|While being a little bigger than I wanted, this USB battery pack works great.  After charging it up, I plugged it into my dead Kindle fire and in about 3 hrs. the Kindle was fully charged.  The battery pack was down to one light by then but after charging it back up, it's charged two smart phones twice.  Great unit and I may buy another.
1476727910|5.0|I picked up this book based on a review in Entertainment Weekly where the writer gave it a B+... after reading it, I think it deserved a higher grade. I started this book at 5pm on a Friday and finished it by 3pm the next day. So enjoyable, & such a quick read. The plot was very predictable, but I didn't find that it took away from the experience of reading it. It was written in a unique format (by an alien addressed to members of his race) about the strange, otherworldly human species, and that added to the fun of discovering Earth through the narrator's eyes. The end became very philosophical, but again, I loved it. It made me feel good about being human and made the experience of enduring each day seem like a battle I should be proud to conquer. The 97 pieces of advice to humans dragged on longer than I expected, but were incredibly heartwarming. The entire book was a love letter to the human race.
1594204217|5.0|Michael Pollan really hits his stride in approaching some of the most important foundations of human experience with food.  Even if you already have a broad background in cooking and food related subjects, Mr. Pollan integrates things so well, combining both theory and very practical examples, as to invite still deeper awareness.
B00D8RYV52|2.0|It is not compatible with my child's tablet (Nabi 2). This is the only Dr. Panda game so far that she isn't able to play on her own device. She is nuts for the Dr Panda games so this is a huge disappointment. I have to let her borrow my Kindle which is an inconvenience to me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is by far the best game I have on my kindle fire! It is REALLY fun!!! I think the people that did one star don't know what they are talking about! How could you not like this game!? 5 stars!!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Somewhat stilted but entertaining for late night.  Could have used a little more drama.  I will never review again if told how many words I must use.
B005FPT51K|5.0|It is so easy to set up, use, and so convenient! You can check on your little one from your phone, iPad at any point in time! The camera can move from side to side so if your little one gets out of bed you can easily follow them. It has a motion detector too if you don't mind an alarm going off when the babe moves. I am so happy we bought this!
B001HMSFFC|5.0|HUGE fan.....we all need more sex and the city movies....please make more for the fans....Cant get enough of the story
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I read the book prior to seeing the movie. I'm not a zombie fan but the book did lead me to see a movie I wouldn't have otherwise gone to so I have to give it credit for that. The &#34;oral history concept&#34; was interesting at first but it got boring and I found the read very disjointed after a while. The normal questions regarding how, why, when went totally unanswered. I finished the book only because I kept hoping to get answers that were never revealed. This is the first time I actually liked a movie better than the book.
B000K3M1VI|5.0|Emotional movie....the ending plot is so touching, i cant ever imagine having to make a decision like that! Meryl is fantastic as usual
B004X8W4A4|4.0|Was all right!
B001QD5OSS|5.0|I have watched it a ton of times, and its such a beatiful movie, sweet and loving....a happy movie, fantastic
B003INBNXO|5.0|This is a great martial arts movie about a humble man full of integrity and family oriented. He knows his skill well and you absolutely will fall in love with his character. I look for everything Donnie Yen makes. An excellent Asian actor.
B004P12SSW|5.0|love Cher, love Christina, great dancing, and vocals, I loved the story and the dance movies, great movie to watch
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Two stars may be too generous. I am so done with this series after book 3 (which was billed as the END of the trilogy). Now I'm expected to wait breathlessly for months for book  4? I don't think so. I feel cheated.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|Huge fan of both actors, please make more for the fans....Cant get enough of the storyi would love a sequel
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book helped me to get my novella up and running.  I think that it will be of assistance to anyone who is planning to publish to kindle.
B00493E1GI|3.0|movie is unrealistic....totally relying on Julia Roberts and traveling, she never really gets it annd the audieance is lost 20 minutes in....
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Please don't buy it and do not read it!! Boring and it is not the end of the series of the three books. I feel cheated. Such a disappointment!!! I am never buying any book written by Sylvia Day again.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|HUGE fan.....we all need more sex and the city movies....please make more for the fans....Cant get enough of the story
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because you can chose different characters with the money you earn. It is a fun and fast game, the scenes change. I am six years old and I love this game.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read about this book on Maryse's blog. It was one of the best books ever. It is really good to read a funny book written by a women but under the man's POV....
0399226907|5.0|Even your youngest will love this one. Great book to create child parties around. We're considering celebrating our little caterpillar turnin into a beautiful butterfly on her 1st birthday!
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|Lucas could have resolved the movie much earlier if he had asked his mom for the number of his grandfather to call home with their information.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|My dad used to watch this, without missing an episode each week, when I was a kid.  Now when I watch it , I am taken back to the time I had no responsibilities sitting there on the edge of my seat with my dad.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. Very challenging but not to tough if you take your time and use your little grey cells. Can't wait for the updates.
B000VSAEYI|2.0|We were all very excited to get this pool.  However, after 10 minutes of play, air was already leaking out.  Couldn't find a leak, closed all the valves including the one for the hose and still no luck.  Shouldn't have to troubleshoot so much on a brand new pool.  Disappointed, I had to deflate all the pieces which took awhile and send it back.  We would have loved this pool if it actually worked.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is helpful because you can take care of your own horse<br />my child plays this game and she loves it
B005HSL626|5.0|Good game to play. Fun and for the whole family. Competitive if you want to bet the score of others.
B00846REIS|5.0|Oh my gosh this book had me hanging on the entire time!! These characters seem like real people I can imagine meeting in real life.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Challenge to play but fun. Everyone will like it and play often. You have to wait sometimes to get more time.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|An good app lol I love it so much I mean I lov it I really really do its awesome.
1577311523|5.0|Emphasizes living in the here and now, rather than in the past or worrying about the future.  Keys to retraining your brain to do so.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I read two books previously written by this author, and they were very good.  And The Mountains Echoed is not worth the time it takes to read or the purchase price.  It is disjointed, the story line is all over the place, and I finished the book wondering why the author even bothered writing it.  Not sure I will ever purchase and read another book written by Hosseini.
B009LDCXQQ|3.0|Since he took the reigns, Supernatural has only averaged 22 episodes per season. Before Jensen: 26 episodes.<br /><br />And if you're expecting this season to have some closure to ANY of the stuff from the previous season(s): YOU'RE WRONG.<br /><br />Another CLIFF-HANGER ending for the season.<br /><br />Just typical. No SHOCKERS, no IMPROV... you just see it coming. That's why Walking Dead has been so Successful:<br /><br />! ! ! KEEP YOUR FANS GUESSING ! ! !
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good app for what it is. Wish there were more levels. It's not very challenging wish it was a bit harder.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|Just because Iron Man 1 & 2 were awesome (thank you to JON FAVREAU for THAT), doesnt mean that SHANE BLACK is ANY GOOD at directing nor writing.<br /><br />Which he CLEARLY wasnt.<br /><br />This movie sucked SO BAD.<br /><br />Dont believe the trailers nor Box Office $$$ count. It sucks all around. Iron Man 2 is the 2nd greates movie of all time (as far as I'm concerned), and IM 1 came in 4th, right behind Avengers. IM3 is WAY DOWN, not even in the TOP 10 ! ! !<br /><br />Quality, Story, Ending.... THEY ALL SUCKED ! ! !<br /><br />Acting: No Complaints. Which means it was ALL SHANE BLACKS FAULT ! ! !<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Worth watching? (for FREE) - YES.<br />Watching in theatre? - NO.<br /><br />Worth buying on DVD? - Probably Not.<br />Worth buying on Blu-Ray? - HELL NO ! ! !
B007SOQBCM|4.0|This a application is really not that bad.  I haven't had any real problems yet so far the app works perfectly.  The only thing that I would say it's that they need to add a browse or search option.  Because there are videos out there that my friends want me top watch but I don't know how to find them on my kindle fire hd because there is no search option.if there was I would put down 5 stars.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Movie was ok, definetely a movie for the kids to watch, I only gave it 3 stars becuase there were parts that they didn't show in the movie, but like I said a movie for the kids.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|a great story of the residual effects of trying to build a new life and learning to trust again after abuse.  Tears and cheers for this story.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have been in and out of the card game since Ice Age and this is a nice game to be able to play without having to buy and build completely new decks (though building new and unique decks is fun). The flow of the game is quite nice with the AI realizing when you have no possible action and automatically moving the game along. Some of the challenges are interesting and the music is not bad either. Worth the money to get a decent Magic diversion.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Aside from all the names and characters where I just can't keep track, the story of America's entry into WWII is absolutely fascinating.  At times, I just can't put the book down even though I know the ending.  Most of the book is about the isolationists vs the interventialists. So take sides, grab a comfortable chair and enjoy.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|AWESOME I loved it and I highly recommend this book to all that like to read and have pictures in there head
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought this for it was a long cable, and it recharges my kindle with quickness, I highly recommend anyone who has a kindle to get this .
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good, all of the people were surmised and there was closure. It had some exciting parts and in a way a hated it was done. Not as good as the other two books, but all was complete.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|fun to play accept at times it freezes and you can't undo anything. When it freezes then you loose the game you were in the process of playing. at time is also freezes when purchasing coins or bingo and it charges your account but never delivers the items purchased.  Kinda irritating

B002NFCHBA|5.0|I also have another complete edition of Chopin but this one is just delightful to hear!!  Some pieces in the other are not as brilliant as in this version.  Waltz #1--Grande Waltz Brillante for instance is just great.  just like I remember from the Tom and Jerry where Tom is flying around the yard chasing the yellow bird and hunting down Jerry.  If you already have a Chopin Complete Edition, you can add this one and it can enhance your entire collection or if you don't have any Chopin and want to acquire a complete edition all you need is this one and need not buy another.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I enjoyed this book it had a lot of surprises. This book will keep you entertained for the whole novel NEVER A DULL MOMENT

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I looked everywhere for this DVD for my 3 year old daughter and when I found it I was sooooo excited! My experience with buying this was great! Thank you so very much!
B0034G4P8A|4.0|I saw this in 3D at the cinemas, I went not really sure what to expect but it exceeded my expectations. I particularly wanted the High Def version for those spectacular extra-terrestrial environments.<br /><br />The film is pretty good, prefer it over Captain America but Iron Man is still my favourite. It is probably a good idea to watch it if you wish to see Avengers.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I received my movie and I was very pleased with the whole experience! I have a three year old and she just loves the movie!
B00B4804KS|5.0|So, this review may not be entirely objective. I have owned the 1-3 collection (on DVD) for over a decade now and I love every single minute. I shelled out and got this Blu-Ray pack of the first one 1) because we have a 3D TV and I've never used this feature and 2) because I love JP and wanted it in HighDef. I couldn't believe it when I saw in the cinemas that they were re-releasing the film in 3D. Made perfect sense to me! I not only paid an extortionate amount of money to see the 3D film in the cinemas, I also immediately bought this as soon as it became available.<br /><br />One of the main reasons I purchased this particular pack is because of the cover design. It's embossed of the iconic gates and has minimal information on the front (rating, legal copy, logos etc), so as to not spoil the overall design.<br /><br />Any die-hard JP fan should get their hand on a copy. It's great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is the best game ever. I'm glad they made another game like Temple Run. Temple Run was starting to get old, but Subway Surfers will never get old.I look forward to where we go next.
B007VUCAVO|3.0|I purchased this app because it seemed my Galaxy Tab was having battery issues. This apps ads said that it would \\"calibrate\\" the battery which I suppose it does but only to more accurately reflect the battery's state of charge. It does nothing to improve the battery though. This seems to be the same trick Apple used when one of the \\"I\\" devices experienced antenna issues. It does nothing to make the (antenna) battery better, it only improves the accuracy of what is reported. Maybe my expectations were not realistic.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Godfather series is one of the greatest series of movies ever produced. I haven't watched this Blu-ray set yet as about a month before finding this edition we watched the DVD set again.  The dvd's will now be given to a friend and in the future we will enjoy the even better (if possible) quality of Blu-ray.

B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is adicting. Love the characters and the story line.<br />I started watching this show a few weeks ago and I got so into it that I would stay up until 130am watching it even though I had to get up early to go to work.<br />Cannot wait for the new season to start.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Son loves it. Recommended to help with daily players boredom always something new to do even if you are looking for low maintenance tasks..
B0017I1FP8|5.0|Another excellent movie score by composer Hans Zimmer. The music brings out the dark storyline, of this movie. Foot-stomping, heart-pounding music. The soundtrack arrived, in the mail earlier than was stated in the order. Amazon, like in the movie, the store in Miracle on 34th Street, will direct you to another site with lower prices for the product you are buying. Amazon is highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Could not get in to this novel at all, although I do love the genre just not for me maybe.
0451197968|5.0|This book is a thrill ride.  I think I finished it in two or three sittings.  It is simply a futuristic, desperate, and passionate story about a man on the run.  There's some social commentary if you're looking for it, but its not preachy.  I really enjoyed this book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love Gideon Cross.  He is one sexy billionaire. He sizzles and definitely delivers on all his promises. Bring on more Gideon.
0451169514|4.0|The first chapter of this book has to be one of the most enthralling introductions to a book I've ever read.  It is well paced,  and will keep you coming back for more.  The only reason I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is that it has some pretty adult themes that border on offensive at one point in particular.  Otherwise, this is a great book, and essential to the collection of any horror fan.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|loved this game for 20 years or so cant go wrong with Magic: The Gathering for android feel like a kid again whooping up on some nubs
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I bought this for my husband because he enjoyed the movie Lincoln. He tells everyone he meets to be sure and read it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I got this for my Kindle and couldn't put it down. The TV show doesn't do the book justice. Not for the faint of heart. Engrossing read! I will read it again to catch nuances I'm sure I missed on the first reading. Game of Thrones is on my top 10!
B007ZQJR4M|5.0|This is a well thought-out story; superbly voice-acted, and entertaining.  A must have for any fan of the zombie genera.

B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham never disappoints me.  I loved the characters..very different from his other books.  I highly recommend it.  Great read.
0143037757|5.0|What an amazing book!  If you ever wondered what happened in Europe after the war--how it recovered, divided into new countries,  how the cold war progressed---the people, places,--- well, this book has it all! Extremely well-written and thorough.  I feel more aware of how things progressed, transitioned and evolved.  Highly recommended.
B00D7D9MBK|5.0|Very different and ROCKS Hebrew/Orient style. The music and the words are very moving but have edge and progressive punch.
B000ICZCZS|5.0|This is the most genuine role I've ever seen Hugh Grant perform.  The boy is a wonderful foil for Grant's shallow character.  You're left wondering if \\"about a boy\\" refers to the 12-year-old or Grant's self-absorbed shallow character.  Funny and touching.

0321714113|5.0|If you're looking to learn c++ starting from scratch first start with some youtube tutorials, get to where they teach you about classes and become reasonably comfortable with the basic class operations also be comfortable with the stuff they teach before that.  Once you've done that, you should be able to really appreciate a more logical and formalized explanation of all of the basic aspects of the language. I just got to part 3 and I feel like this book does a very good job filling in the gaps.  But before I start a new chapter on something I didn't know, I usually consult a youtube tutorial just to get a basic idea of what the heck the thing actually does and the very basic operations, then I read the chapter for a thorough exposition.  That's what I had to do for associative containers and dynamic memory, because I felt I couldn't appreciate the fine details without having first gotten my feet a little wet.<br /><br />Overall an outstanding book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. It needs more levels though. I was sad when I got to the end of the levels available. I wanted to continue to play. It is mind challenging and I would recommend it to other puzzle fans :)

B00DD49R0E|5.0|I loved the first movie and the second installment was not disappointing.  Okay, Gru is evil but he is also a model boss, keeping his minions informed and work conditions outstanding.  I wish my office had a rec room and an ice cream bar!  The music in the movie is spot on and it has humor for all ages; there is even a nod to \\"The Love Boat.\\"  The final credits, like the first movie, strutted out the minons to demonstrate the amazing 3D effects.  The kids around me kept trying to catch the bubbles! See it in the theater (stay until the lights come up) and put this one on your pre-order list.

B00BTM2L8W|5.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King since I was about thirteen. It was through his stories that I leaned to apply the ideas and things in my own head into a medium, that would be writing.<br /><br />The book is great, and it is not just some text book with a \\"how to write good\\" approach. This book tells a story of the things that inspired him, then he talks about what he feels will make a novice or wannabe author into a great writer.<br /><br />The outline of general writing is great, and Stephen goes into perfect detail on his craft. Reading the back story of how he was working while supporting his wife and kids was insperational, considering how anyone who has ever been in a bookstore or library would know the name Stephen King, and how he has made a name and huge impact on the world for his genres. One of my favorite parts in this book to be honest wasn't the tips on writing, it was how he described his reaction when he sold \\"Carrie\\". That alone gave me hope.<br /><br />I have read the book more than once and I have take Stephen's advice and to be honest this advice wasn't just about \\"how to write good\\" either, Stephen King said a few things that helped me write my first book, he said that you need to let your characters live and do not focus on outlines, that in reality they slow you down, just write and move with he flow and before you know it your chacaters are making choices on their own. He was right. I threw out the outline I was following... and just started to write.<br /><br />I also would like to comment that since Stephen King is in the horror genre he did manage add an horror element to this book. He wrote about his accident and the painful experence in great details about the van that hit him while he was on a daily walk. It was a good read that had me with phantom pains in my legs. All in all I recommend this book to everyone who wants to be a writer - no matter what genre you are in - and to Stephen King fans who have no iterest in becomming an author... fantastic read.<br /><br />R. L. Vogeler, author of<br />[[ASIN:0989052702 Reminiscence of An American Dream]]r... fantastic read.<br /><br />R. L. Vogeler, author of<br />[[ASIN:0989052702 Reminiscence of An American Dream]]
B0094LYM14|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this gem that I had not previously heard of.  I had mentioned that I enjoy Sam Rockwell as an actor to a friend and they recommended this movie.  The story is strong and keeps you interested despite really only having one actor on the screen the whole time.  I would classify it a sci-fi movie, but think that anyone who likes quirky self discovery movies would enjoy this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Simply addicting. Really fun game. Easy for all ages, yet always entertaining. The horses always need care. You can change their tack and go to different shows. Horses can be customized with different styles and colors of makes and tails. Very realistic or whimsical...whichever you choose!
B000SEGTI0|4.0|I hadn't read the Blade Runner source material in years. It's quite different from the film: more socially critical, relentlessly quirky and playful. It also gets inside the psychology of dehumanization from angles that the filmmakers decided to bypass. I love the film, understand, despite its omissions and its continuity errors. But Dick's vision is (as the old Michelob ads used to say) a completely unique experience, and one well worth exploring.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I usually enjoy Will Smith movies but I really could not get into this.  I felt using his son was a stretch for the character he tried to portray.  The action was good but the movie did not develop into what I was hoping it would.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|I know, I know, most people loved this book.  And I wanted to love it, too, but . . .<br /><br />I didn't.<br /><br />There was a lot I did love about the book.  The main protagonist, Harold Fry, is well-rounded, believable, and sympathetic.  I really liked him despite his admitted flaws.  And I was rooting for him to complete his pilgrimage to walk to the deathbed of a friend before she died.<br /><br />I liked the concept of Harold setting out only to the corner postbox to mail a letter to his friend and the notion that he just kept going, finally deciding to walk more than 500 miles to deliver the letter in person.  I liked the notion of an ordinary man doing something extraordinary.  And I loved the manner in which strangers he encountered along the way would open up to him about their own lives and fears and dreams after learning about Harold's quest.  And I loved that the reader learned a little bit more about the tragedies from Harold's past (and his eventual estranged relationship with his own wife and son).<br /><br />I even enjoyed the description of the length of England that he traversed even though I am not familiar with English geography (though admittedly I think I would have enjoyed it more if it had been describing something I could imagine better . . . like the states across the USA.  But that's my own flaw, not the flaw of the book).<br /><br />But despite loving all of these things, I didn't love the finished product.  I found the pacing uneven and the narrative bogged down at times.  It just didn't move along at a fast enough clip for me.  And, yes, I fully realize that such a complaint is ironic (and perhaps moronic) when applied to a book about an unplanned walk across an entire country . . . a plot that was intended to be literally plodding.  But I also wouldn't care to watch a documentary about such a journey that depicted every step.<br /><br />This one just moved a little bit too slowly for me.<br /><br />But, then again, maybe you should read it anyway.  Most everybody else seemed to love this book.  So maybe I am the slow one.  Or just too impatient for true literature.read it anyway.  Most everybody else seemed to love this book.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This show is sooooo amazing! It more that the zombies...it's the characters in the group and everything they go through....alll their struggles to survive in the world and with one another. I LOVE it! My favorite character is Daryl Dixon.....who is sooo scarred from life inside out and his character is very related to other people who have gone through similiar situations...you can't help but love this character.
B000U0F7RG|4.0|First off, if you love this show, then this is for you.<br /><br />Pros: comes with episode guide and \\"gilmore-isms\\" book.<br />tons of extra features<br />comes with a neat handle for the case<br /><br />cons: full-screen<br />box is large and difficult to fit on a shelf with other dvds

B000IZXR20|4.0|This movie is a fun watch.  Decent story, creepy and almost believable.  Definitely worth watching.  Fans of the genre should enjoy it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It was a grasping story of how a father might try to help is son.  The mother was able to identify a serious problem that eluded the father and all of this made for a great story.  It also dwelt a bit on the inter relationship of the locals in Newton, MA.
B002UQIH20|5.0|This is the best work Beck has ever done and probably ever will do. After 11 years this album is still being recognized as one of the greats and continues to grow in popularity. I won't go into the songs as way too many people already have, but it's a masterpiece for sure. This record grows on you with each listen and never seems to get old(deserted island record for sure). You do not have to be sad to enjoy this as many people have stated. Although, if you have ever been through a rough ending relationship you may have a deeper understanding of what he is saying. I listen to it when I'm happy, sad or whatever. This should easily be in the top 50 greatest albums of all time although it's ranked 436 of 500 greatest. There's a reason it's the only one of his albums to be remastered by Mobile Fidelity on vinyl(which is what I bought recently).
B000NHG7BQ|5.0|After reading all of the comments/reviews about the Unrated Director's Cut of Revenge I have to agree with most that this version has been edited a bit too much and a lot of the good scenes from the original version cut which I didn't like and couldn't understand. But if you watch and listen to Tony Scott's interview on this DVD after watching the movie, you will find out that he wanted it this way because he wanted to delete all of the boring scenes and get straight to the heart of the story which he did and did an excellent job at that. So true! So now I do understand why this version was cut shorter than the original. It makes sense and really I think it's made the movie more heart felt if anything. So, I have to agree with Tony Scott on this because after watching the movie I have to admit I really like this version MUCH better than the original. Now, here's my opinion ... if only they could combine the original version with this Unrated Director's Cut version and add everything together it would literally make it an EPIC like Scarface or The Godfather! I would've loved to have seen a follow up to this movie like a Part II. Why? Because of course Tibby was still alive when Cochran left him under the tree after finding out Miyrea is in a convent. Most people probably would've liked to have believed the two new friends of Cochran's (sidekicks) that helped him find Miyrea, shot and killed Tibby right after Cochran left them under the tree. But I choose to believe different. I would like to believe they let him live knowing what more could Tibby do to his old friend Cochran because he knew Miyrea was dying in the convent and that would pretty much be the end of Cochran's life and world once she died in his arms in the end. But all to the contrary that's when I think things would really start to heat up even more between the two ex-friends in Mexico in a Part II sequel. I know that Anthony Quinn has long since died since this movie was made, June 3, 2001 to be exact but as always the producers could've always found another great actor to take his place which I feel would've been intriguing and something new to add to the movie, but of course keeping Costner in it but with a new love interest since Miyrea died in the first movie. or Cochran could stay single in the second part as his devotional love to Miyrea. Just a thought. Although Quinn was a huge force when he was alive as an actor and every time I think of Tibby in that movie I will always think of Quinn as no one in my book could've played the part better. But again, to combine these two versions of the movie to make one LONG EXTENDED version would be the BOMB!!! :) I would LOVE it with a passion as it's at the top of my list of favorite movies of all time. Hoping one day this will happen on DVD and Blue-Ray as well as a Part II sequel but not done cheesy as most Part II's are done. Hoping if anything it will equal the first if not better and still to have it all filmed in Mexico as the first was. But I seriously doubt this will ever take place as well as the extended version with both versions put together. Such a shame. This movie is truly a MASTERPIECE and should go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time! It's really the best parts both Costner and Stowe have ever made in their film careers I think.  Just love this movie and so glad I didn't go by other's comments about all of the editing and parts that were cut because I was seriously thinking about not getting it just for those reasons alone but so so glad I did because I really highly recommend this version, the Uncut Director's Version over the original. You be the judge. Watch both and decide for yourself. We're all different and we know what we like.<br />With this all said ... would like to end by saying THANK YOU SO MUCH TONY SCOTT for making this movie come to life on the big screen! It's truly YOUR BEST EVER!!!! To add: the cinematography is to die for in this movie. Just love the landscapeshots throughout the movie of parts of Mexico and the colors are just out of this world magnificent!!! Will never be able to get enough of this movie for as long as I live.shots throughout the movie of parts of Mexico and the colors are just out of this world magnificent!!!

B0033AX1YG|4.0|If you love blues you'll certainly love the sound of Gray Moore. \\"Still Got the Blues\\" is one of my personal favorites. Put the DVD in and crank up the surround sound! Get ready to listen to a blues manic! Good stuff!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love this series.  it has an Interesting story, great character development and great acting.  It is well worth watching.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|The Eye of God was a fantastic and fast read. Rollins is able to weave blood and guts adventure with accurate historical references and cutting edge science into a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Very predictable. Was good but not as good as the previous Die Hard. Glad I waited for the rental release.
006178480X|3.0|Kudos to those who liked this novel better than I did. I found that it got off to a slow start as the author not only introduced characters, but also provided many science lessons....and not a few history lessons as well. Sci-Fi fans will probably get into this much easier than I did, but for me the story was a awkward and not so compelling. I suppose had I really believed the world would end in four days, I would have spent my time better!
B00C81AVNU|1.0|Not the kinky boots I heard years ago, I hated this score!
B00908DDZM|4.0|The music is quite good.  A lot of the songs can be motivational on my morning commute when I am wishing I could be sleeping.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very addicting. Complicated enough to keep you guessing but not too hard to give up.  No hints allows which keeps me from cheating.
B003DT19F0|5.0|This movie was in very good condition as well as the packaging. It had no defects. Really loved watching it, great for both adults and children.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best. The U.S. needs to take cues from the Brits. Shows that are not full of sex and language are enjoyed by many of us. I can't wait for season 4. Acting is superb and scenery is great.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This DVD was in very good condition, it had a slight scratch but it did not affect the viewing quality.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Love Janelle Monae! She is so gorgeous and unbelievable! The hope of the next generation R&B. New music is amazing as always!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Was sceptical at first, got hook and did all the levels in one evening. Now I am wanting more, hope the promise of more levels released comes soon than later. I will be on look out.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very good read. I'm going to read golden Hoover's other books now, very good author. Can't wait to read the sequel
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|We watched this movie as a family - my daughter is seven.  It was fun and light-hearted.  The plot was understandable to my daughter - not a single question during the movie.  We all laughed out loud at times.  For a kid movie, it was great.  Beats Cinderella and the like any day!
0451208706|5.0|I love Ken Follett. Great writer. If you like historical fiction, you will love it also. The story also builds toward the end.
B003KJF2WE|5.0|I remember watching The Incredible Hulk as a kid so I was curious what they could do with the movie that would be fresh.  All in all I think they did a good job.  I was surprised by Edward Norton as the Hulk, but he did a great job with the part.  It's an action flix - no real high moral plot here, but that is not why I watch.
B0037HOWKW|3.0|Pieces are very very small. When they fall to the floor, they are gone. Also, pieces don't fit real well as in lego. They come apart easily.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. I seriously cannot think of a game that I had more fun playing a game than when playing this one!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|The game is very fun and challenging. It does take a long though but it is worth it. The only bad thing is nothing.
B00027JYLC|4.0|This is undoubtably the most bizarre movie ever made, and it could not be made today because it is wildly politically incorrect.  Circuses used to have freak shows that looked like something out of Ripley's Believe it or not.  Apparently the \\"freaks\\" were willing to make a living out of their oddities, but it still seems to me to be disgusting to exploit such a thing and have people gawk at this.  There is a speech given that condescendingly begs the audience to have compassion for such people, and yet surely the movie itself depends upon getting the viewer to see these people as horrifying.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|In my opinion this is QOTSA's best album since &#34;Songs for the Deaf.&#34; I've been listening to it non-stop since I bought it. Even my mom likes it.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|As long as you go into the movie knowing that it's an action adventure flick without great dialogue, you will enjoy it. I liked their take on the old story. I'd say it's worth the $3 rental price for a nice relaxing watch.
0440246318|3.0|A great story line that hooks you from the git-go and compels the reader to not put the book down. What seemed a perfect setting for our hero Jack Reacher turned out to be anything but. A formulaic change midway through was disappointing and left this reader wondering if Mr. Child can actually divorce himself from the typical grand finale to a great finale.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was.  It was not trite, and was less predictable than I had thought.  I thought the dialogue between Seth and Barbra flowed naturally.  And, I laughed out loud on several occasions.
B00APYKXFS|5.0|I was not going to download this app because of the bad ratings.  Then I went to Google Play Store, and lo and behold it has almost a5 star rating so I checked it  4 is more close, but felt some needs to make for the haters.<br /><br />Its not a bad to play but hey when I was young this would have been hot stuff.<br /><br />I have a note 2.  This game is easier , much easier with the lager screen.  You can adjust the screen size.  It starts at 85 and I moved to 97%.  Would not recommend this game people with smaller screen phones., the screen size that must be for larger tablets, can't see anyone else useing it.<br /><br />I found it very fast moving.  Perhaps a lirtle to fast for me.  I grew up with original pac man and galaxy.  Ya would have been  smart .ove on the developer to use different colors on the ships, I found my fingers over my ship the whole time so who realy cares.<br /><br /> I will keep the game on for now.  Fast game with action....perfect for when you have short wait for something and don't want to get to involved in something.<br /><br />Look guys I get so tired of all the negitive reviews. You don't like permission s, well don't down load.  They all say up frint what they are.  Why give it 1 star some say 0 if avaliable.  I would like reviews based on honest opinion of the app not oppinion of the permissions .<br /><br />The free apps are fun and sometimes you find a gem and some times s rock.  [Rocks can be interesting too for some people]<br /><br />Look at the free app as a grab bag.  If like what you see give it a test ride, if not move on.  I dont understand why play store users like the apps at full price and amazon people hate them for free<br /><br />Some guy named Robert Reese give pretty good , in depth and balanced reviews based on use of app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to read and follow along, with this version. I am enjoying it. A must have if you don't already have it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The author kept my interest during the entire book, mostly due to his technique of giving very detailed side stories of each character.  Rather than just being another person in the story line, the reader gets to know them at a much deeper level.  I really like this author's writing style and also enjoyed the Kite Runner by him.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is exactly what it promises. no more no less. Easy to learn, enough variation to stretch enjoyable game play.  You won't play it forever, but its a fun month or so's worth of entertainment.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|We can't stop laughing when we watch this TV series. Loving it! It was definitely a great purchase for us.
B002APU580|5.0|Best rendition of this classic book. Loved this movie! Acting is great and I would reccomend this movie to anyone.
0425263924|5.0|Absolutely loved the book can't wait til the next one comes out. You as a reader just wants more its hard to put the book the down! Good job Sylvia!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and addictive! You may be able to escape the rooms but can you escape the game? The game is beckoning me as I share the review...gotta go.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|It was ok, I liked the adventure but it's almost too confusing to read, and not even at the end could u understand what happened through the book, I hope the last one explains everything or else this was a huge waste of time
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Silvia day continues to keep me reading. Love this series maybe even better than fifty shades i can recommend it
B0001A79JO|4.0|The Horrorpops are one of the funnest band out there. This is there best album but you cant go wrong with any of them if your into rock-a- billy. even if your not this is a great band with a great singer!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this calculator on my kindle fire frequently. It does what it was create  to do and is very convenient. I highly recommend it and would purchase another app from this developer.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Measures up to the rest of the Lord of the Rings.  Thoroughly entertaining and a fun trip in the fantasy genre.
B000U2GZMU|5.0|I bought this as a present and the recipient loved it!!! He's a huge fan of the story and was so surprised to receive the novel.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|What a great rendition of this moving story.  I wondered how it would be put to music, but the cast and producers did a fantastic job.  Another classic!
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Works exactly how you would expect it too. I have this for my tablets as well as my phones. Five stars!
B0018LMZOO|5.0|I own the vinyl copy of this CD and purchased it because of the bonus tracks that are not on the original copy.<br />In addition, this is one of my favorite albums by the Moody Blues and the CD format has restored the original sound<br />that years of play have taken away from the vinyl copy.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I LOVE this series. I wish I wouldn't have read it so fast! The TV show is great too, but the books are so much better!
B000000H4V|5.0|I have wanted this cd for years now. I had the tape went to the concert for it at the time and it blew me away. if you like heavy music this is a must
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I bought this for my children who have just started to fall in love with Tim Burton type animation. The two disc set is great! I find myself using both discs in different rooms quite often.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This series is absolutely amazing. The premise is unique the acting top notch! The writing is fantastic and I love that as I watch I honestly have no idea what is going to happen. That is so fresh and new compared to many other series I've watched that are so predictable.<br /><br />I'm thrilled Amazon showed this on my Kindle and I'm even more thrilled I checked it out. I was drawn in immediately. Looking forward to the next season with bated breath!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I LOVE this series. I wish I wouldn't have read it so fast! The TV show is great too, but the books are so much better!
0761169253|4.0|Serves as a great, simple & concise desktop-handbook. I see it as more of a chronicled list of points to remember, rather than a tough or detailed read, as it can be quickly read in one sitting. Does contain very useful information - the boiled down versions iterated in a casual, fun tone including funny and relatable examples.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As a historian, I have found the series to be absolutely captivating and historically accurate.  I cannot wait for Season 4.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|interesting theory but I wasn't impressed with the movie as a whole. too many how did that happen to the movie.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Buy it! The quality is excellent and the movie is fun for the little ones to adult. No language or violence to meke you hesitate. I'll be sure it to the 4 grandkids for many years to come.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really wanna thank the developers for doing this good app is efficient big numbers and easy and free I can do my domestic accounting at home or wherever I want
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have played a lot of bingo games, but this one is the best hands down. I love the music thats played in each of the challenge rooms as well as in the slots challenge rooms. I have this game on my desktop, android phone & tablet. Great bingo game for beginners to pros<br /><br />PLa
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I know nothing of horses, and this teaches you basics. I really got confused in the beginning but once you get going its ok. I am still trying to figure out how to make more coins though.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|It was a gift for my best friend. She loves it. I was not happy with the shipping process. It took longer than expected.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I love this movie. Also I was very pleased to find this combination on-line. A lot times when they put a movie like this out they want you to buy: the blu-ray, blu-ray 3D, DVD, and Digital Copy. I may be weird but all I really want is the Blu-ray and DVD, so this was the perfect package for me.
0425267695|5.0|Simply stunning. Every cliché bit of praise one can laud on a book applies here: the characters are believably drawn and enticing, the pace of the plot simply soars, and the quality of the prose far exceeds what one normally expects from the genre.<br /><br />There are enough five-star reviews giving an outline of plot, so as someone who doesn't read much fantasy (my only real frame of contemporary reference would be the Song of Ice & Fire books and the Kingkiller Chronicles), here's what had me traumatized by the finality of the last page, knowing I must wait for the next installment.<br /><br />Scope:<br />This book covered a tremendous amount of ground without spilling unnecessary ink. It is largely the tale of one character in a complex world. As such, it was easy to keep focus on what was happening without feeling like I needed to have a room filled with maps and character charts to keep track of things. Yet it still feels epic. (Note: if you read the e-book, do go to the author's site for a high-resolution map.)<br /><br />Believability:<br />One thing that keeps me from reading much fantasy is that I despise fanciful description for description's sake. The endless customs of the Adem in the Name of the Wind, the verbose descriptions of creatures in The Amber Spyglass, etc... such descriptions annoy me to no end and I was relieved to never get the inkling that Anthony Ryan was indulging in this manner.<br /><br />I'm also not a big fan of excessive magic. I like just enough for the story to be exotic, but not so much that rules of nature cease to exist. The gradual introduction of the supernatural is so well done in this that when it does arise my heartbeat quickened as I tried to understand what was happening.<br /><br />Not too much warfare, please:<br />I've never cared much for big books of war. When the tactical descriptions start, I tend to yawn and wonder if I really need to pay attention. Not here. Descriptions of battle are either blissfully short (for me), or carefully described in language and content that kept me focused. This said, if you love battle I'm sure you'll find enough in here to keep you going.<br /><br />Characters are real:<br />This isn't merely a concern when reading fantasy, but it's worth a mention here. The characters are all fully three-dimensional and rich in complexity. The heroes are not flawless or superhuman, and the bad guys have their reasons. If only Ayn Rand could have learned this lesson, but now I digress...<br /><br />If more fantasy grabbed me like this, I might become a junky. This reads like finely conceived literature that is gifted with a touch of magic and a breakneck pace. Stop hesitating and buy it already. Or wait a few years so you'll be spared the pause in between books. But then again, you may not be alive tomorrow, so better read it now while you can.
B0000E5NPZ|5.0|I absolutely love this film. The location, the story line, the acting. I have never liked Deborah Kerr and I finally remember it is because of seeing this movie when it was at the drive-in, but she is perfectly cast. The best part is that this seems to be a foreign film and yet it is in English, no subtitles and no voice overs, however you feel you are in France and not a tourist as so often happens.<br />Bouncing back in coulor and forward in black and white is brilliant as you will understand as the story moves forward; and a good one it is. \\"Hello good life. Goodbye happiness\\"
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My kids love the app it is very good for your brain<br />This is a very  nice, fun, entertaining game
B000AYEL6U|4.0|altogether good and pretty close to the original novel.good performances by all in cast,especially thornton's mother sinead cusack who is excellent.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|Ok I read a lot of negative reviews, however, I still purchased the catfish for my 14 by 4 foot round above ground pool \\"Intex\\".  It is great!!!,  I see that this may not be a great idea for a a BIG IN GROUND POOL.  After all you paid more $$ for the inground pool so You must pay more $$ to clean it!!!  That is all I have to say for those that complained about it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever i love this game. I've unlocked many characters and etc. ; )  I love it when it also atuomatically updates<br />I also love purchasing coins to buy more stuff.
B000024J7B|5.0|Every Blur album is good, good not always to the full 10/10 meter but always clocks in with worth in our CD collections. The Great Escape is no exception. If you liked Parklife's \\"This Is a Low\\" then there's a better or equal track called \\"He Thought Of Cars\\". I don't know any group who turns simple subject matter into deep musical great escapes like Blur does. The deep, more melancholy tracks are: \\"Best Days\\", and \\"He Thought of Cars\\". The \\"wit and humour\\" tracks are: \\"Stereotypes\\", \\"Country House\\", \\"Mr. Robinson's Quango\\" and \\"Fade Away\\", yes I didn't mention \\"Top Man\\" because I wasn't compatible with the 'wit' of other mentioned tracks there in my opinion. Great album. Great songs, especially \\"Mr Robinson's Quango\\" and \\"He Thought of Cars\\". Blur is a great rock band, great music.
B008OOYALE|5.0|i love this game! it is so much fun and its super cute! its free, and the graphics are really good.
B003QSMC18|5.0|We love this movie!  It's great to see more music and singing in this movie like the older Disney movies had.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I really like John Corey and his wise-cracking, irreverent self.  Very funny stuff and a lot of clever satirical commentary about how various law enforcement agencies get along.......NOT!  In addition, a very up close and personal look into chemical and biological warfare.  Scary stuff.  The story dragged in spots, and I think DeMille has a tendency to over-explain and over-describe.  I found myself impatient to &#34;get on with it&#34; on several occasions.  However, I eagerly purchased the second in the series, The Lion's Game, so the meandering pace is obviously tolerable.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|I'm rating it five because I have no reason to rate it any lower. When I read a good review, but it's only a four, I just don't understand.  I really connected to a lot of Sedaris`s quirky observations and humorous story telling. I thoroughly enjoyed my first David Sedaris book, and am having a difficult time choosing which one I'll buy after I'm done posting this review... should I start from the beginning and go in order? I picked this one to start with originally because I quit smoking for an extended period of time, but was lured back into it, and wanted to see what his experience was like hoping it would help me in some way.  Well I don't have twenty thousand to invest in my journey, but at least I laughed my ass off reading about his.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|I respectfully disagree with anyone who says the sound quality is low.  It may well be on MP3, because the castration fascination of our current audio age cuts out tons of undertones, overtones, middle tones.  Well, it cuts out everything but the chosen bits.  I'm so far back on this that I apologize for sounding like an outtake from Star Trek:  The Next Generation.  However.  One sonic approximation is not the \\"fault\\" of Mr. Ferry nor his co producers nor his musicians.  Everyone notes it's on vintage instruments.  I wish our listeners' ears were accurate to the vintage sound, but we've all been blown out by our earpieces and our compressions.<br /><br />The songs...well, they are superlative, as most reviewers note.  Performances?  First rate.  This is a cool jazz record of hot jazz.<br /><br />We may agree to disagree.  I think this is a first rate CD.  But now that Mr. Bowie has tossed down the challenge with his era-defying and denying The Next Day, the next move lies upon Mr. Ferry's board.<br /><br />Move well.  I clearly know nothing of chess, but I know a lot about music.  As Olympia was great, Mr. Ferry, you'll still need to do better, sir.  The Rook is no match for the Queen.  Get a band.  Just get a band you never thought you'd ever work with in your life.  You don't need to hide behind your success, because dammit Bryan everyone loves you.  Go get some rank blues guys from Chicago who don't know who you are, but will know, once they hear you, that you know.<br /><br />As a record review, this is an apostrophe to something else.  But I think fans, at least, will get what I'm saying.  It's time for Mr. Ferry to get off the horse and take a little walk with the help.  Pawns are good.  They win in the end.<br /><br />Yes or no, boys and girls?
B004LUS390|1.0|the app would not download at all for me it said there was a error ... ... .... ..... .... .... can some one explain this I ether want it to work or I want a refund
B008XX6J4C|3.0|I Liked this the first time through but after a while it just sounded like Yanni or other boring piano players.  Perhaps it would be more fun if I were watching them.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This is a great. Cd and Im very glad I bought it for my girl friend she really enjoys it very much thank you Steve
161383280X|2.0|This review is not about the book content because I haven't read the book yet.  It's about the contruction of the book.  I bought the first 3 books and loved them.  They were hardbacks.  When I was ready to begin book 4, I bought both of the next two books in hardcover to keep them all uniform.  The description of this book is misleading.  I paid a hardcover price but this book is nothing more than a paperback with a somewhat harder cover, not your typical hardcover book.  I'm very disappointed because it won't match my other volumes.  I guess it's my own fault for not reading the dimensions and realizing this one was different.  I'd send it back, but it's not worth the hassle.  So if you are expecting this to be the same size as your other hardcovers, it won't be.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very challenging game. Keeps me entertained for hours. could become addictive. Just got it today, and already lost track of time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enough of a challenge in each level to keep this game fresh. I like that there are many levels on each floor and no hints to help you cheat.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I  got  spoiled by the TV Series &#34;Once upon a Time&#34;. I was expecting this movie to be a little &#34;softer&#34;.  It is not.  BUT...it is very, very good. Money was well spent
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Slow at the beginning but picks up and doesn't stop. An excellent and subtle form of magic with a cast grounded characters. Well done.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|This movie was good, it dragged in parts, but it had a good story line.  Loved the little elves, so cute, and the tooth fairies, adorable.  Little children may get bored with it, they may not grasp the story line, but I think overall it was basically a good film.
B005HE5J7I|5.0|The fictional characters give more life (feelings, personal reflection) to the description of historical events, as well as greater understanding of different mindsets that coexisted at each period. I was hooked from the very beginning and am a little sad to have finished this book as I enjoyed it so much.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|The movie was okay.  It wasn't funny like the trailers led it to be, but it wasn't all bad.  Basically, its a story of a mother and son, she's overbearing and somewhat pushy, he is disrespectful and embarrassed by her, yet they obviously love one another.  Its a road trip of discovery, they find out things about each other that they never knew.  It ends happily enough, but I wouldn't say this film was hilarious, it dragged in parts, and Seth Rogen mumbled a lot.  So overall, not bad, but not really good either.
B008N1V11U|5.0|The graphics are crazy and the game is just like the movie which was awesome too. Over all it is an awesome game.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Loved this movie.  It was cute and full of action, definitely kept the kids and my hubby's attention.  Ralph is really not such a bad guy, all he wants it to be included.  So he sets out to make himself into a hero, a good guy, but in doing so he basically wrecks a lot of things along the way.  Self discovery, friendship, love and a hero.  It is definitely worth watching.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool I could buy it for 1000000000000000000000$<br />But it's for free so cool he he yolo $w@g hashtag.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Bad, entertaining, but bad.  I hated the giants, they were so fake looking and basically just gross.  Jack was cute, the princess was okay, the guards, sorry all but one died, the evil advisor did die, hurray.  The bean stalk, that was the only thing that I thought was good about this film and this is not a kid film.  I would not recommend that little children see this, older kids maybe, but under six may get nightmares.
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|this is the greatest Merlin series ever! So true to the period of time and also has very funny stuff in it!
B005O7PXNS|1.0|Well its not just this show, its all of amazon video. When I first got it, everything was fine. Here lately I keep getting a message of not enough bandwith. I haven't changed anything on my internet service.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My 6 year old grandson really liked this product and played it all the time.  Good choice for kids, keeps them busy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too easy, not too hard. Nice little time waster. This is the best escape type game that I've played so far.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book!  It held me from the first to the last page. The characters were well developed and there was a sense of knowing them throughout the story. I also felt the author had done the necessary research to make the period come to life. Thanks
B004J4WNL2|5.0|If you ever wanted to know the invaluable contributions introverts make to the world, this is your book. If you are an extrovert trying to live with an introverted spouse or child, this book will help you. If you're quiet, deliberate and often overstimulated by common social interactions, learn more about the beauty of your innate weirdness with this book.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I like this version of Pride and Prejudice although it was not as entertaining as the one with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle I liked the ending of it more than the actual presentation. I did not like the lady who played Elizabeth Bennett in the later edition. I thought her to represent Elizabeth as rather silly, much different than the early version.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The story is well written, and by following one family the director was able to focus through unbelievable chaos. Reminded me of The Life of Pi in some ways. Great acting by the stars, but the bit parts and locales communicated a lot of the tragedy, as well. The real people who endure this kind of natural disaster deserve tremendous respect; The Impossible shows that respect.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great underlying story of not to hurt the planet for money, it is a great story and makes you think.  Get it!
0345525558|4.0|The heroine is deeply flawed and so limited that I was surprised to find myself rooting for her. I wanted Victoria to rise above her perceived and real sins, to transcend her circumstances and develop warm, giving relationships. You will learn about the coping skills of children in foster care and how &#34;aging out&#34; warrants a better system of social support, especially if you remember what 18 year olds are: part little kid, part adolescent, and some emerging adult sprinkle in. BTW: If you plan vacations around the nearby Botanical Gardens, or if you own more than a few gardening reference books, this is a story for you!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|After I read it went right out and bought the DVD. Easy reader very nice love story, real-life events. Loved it.
1781162646|4.0|This book was an enjoyable and quick summer read.  It wasn't typical Stephen King - there wasn't anything really bizaare or horrifying, just a crime story with a little bit of of ESP.  It's told in first person narrative by Devin Jones, a college student from New Hampshire who decides to work at an amusement park in North Carolina for the summer.  Devin is an extremely likeable character - a hard working all around nice guy who is on the rebound when his girlfriend dumps him.  The story centers around the people he meets there, a murder that occurred at the park several years ago, and his curiosity about it.  You may like this one if you normally find King's writing too weird to enjoy.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|Five stars do not do justice to this excellant mini-series.  It is the best TV mini-series every made. It documents the American adventures in manned spaceflight through the end of the Apollo flights to the Moon.  The general history of these aceivements is remembered by every person alive at the time, but this series show the human side of these events better than any other TV or book has ever done.  I cannot recommend this series highly enough-and please remember the crew of Apollo 1.
1781162646|5.0|Excellent,  I didn't realize that King was such an excellent writer.  Of course, I spent the last pages under water--mine, not flooding.
0515153656|4.0|I bought this book in response to the character that was brought to life in the Tom Cruise movie.  While I can't see TINY tc in the role of Reacher, I was enamored by the personality/attitude on display in the movie.  Unfortunately, that same nature has not yet surfaced in Child's 1st book.  I will wait to see if Child is building to get there (I don't know how far into the series the Reacher displayed by tc has developed.  Although not fully satisfied, this was a good beginning.
B005K17RU0|2.0|New slide screen has way too much info &amp; is too small to read all that. Graphs are not interesting or helpful (and way too small). Outdoor Conditions - why tell me &quot;You wish there was more wind&quot;? Give me data, not your guess at my opinions! Radar is still the most useful, but now takes much longer to find and load.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Like all freemium games there are traps.  I haven't spent a penny and have all scenes and al but one vehicle.  Tip.  Unlock the race car and highway.  Huge coin maker and even more importantly do NOT waste time or coins on the tank or forest secene.  That is the biggest coin trap in the game.  Even with maxxed out tank you can't very far.  Beyond that one developer ploy it's a fairly straightforward mobile gaming experience.  Fun time killerkiller.
B001E8WNNO|4.0|This is one of my old favorites!  I rented it to show it to the younger generation here at my house.

B00881PTRC|1.0|It has been a while since I tried this game and don't remember much if anything exciting about it. I deleted it right away.

B000GTCZWQ|5.0|Beautiful story between tradition and modernity. I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a beautiful movie. Hard at times, I wouldn't recommend before 9 years old.
B004289ZW0|1.0|I fly piper warriors, working on commercial so I use foreflight, it connects on the ground stops working 1000' AGL or even less maybe more than that. Never ever reconnects I do everything, turn ipad on and off, turn Bluetooth on off, turn the gns on and off, never seems to connect. I've never had it stay locked on a whole flight. How am I suppose to trust this thing. Luckily I haven't ran into any MOAs or RESTRICTED areas cause I know what I'm doing and where I am , but this things connection is horrible. And I have no problems with the on and off swipe. But if I could return this thing I would for every penny I spent its frustrating and I had enough. Horrrrrrrribleeeeeeeeeeeeeee

B0098460O4|3.0|The CD is worth listening to....both artists are young and made some interesting choices in the music.  I do predict that future endeavors will be much improved and delightful.
1781162646|5.0|If a person is expecting a \\"typical\\" Stephen King book, they might be disappointed.  If, however, you are just looking for a flat-out good story, this is a good book to try.  As it is a \\"Hard Case Crime\\" book, it's not hard to figure out that it is a murder mystery.  With a Stephen King twist.  Now, I've read Stephen King since the late 1970's, so let me also say that he is somewhat restrained here, compared to some of his other books.  I was hooked literally from the first paragraph.  There is some fine writing here, some comments on the human condition that actually made me stop and think, and a fair amount of unexpected humor, but by no means overdone.  Everything in this book works for me.  I loved the overall story, the characters and dialogue is first-rate, and while it does have a supernatural element that is essential to the story, it is actually pretty much in the background for most of the book. I read almost all of this book the day I got it, and finished it up the next day.  It's not a long book, but he makes every word count.  This book is sort of like a stripped-down muscle car that has all the essentials but none of the extraneous bells and whistles.  There is no fat in the book, just a lean, mean story that will grab you by the throat.  Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a nice long book, in fact my all-time favorite work of fiction is the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and they don't get much longer than that.  But sometimes the short format works better.  I think this book would have actually suffered if it had been bloated to a huge 700 page door-stopper.  I read a lot of books, and this is without a doubt the best work of fiction I have read in quite some time.  Other than the John Grisham books, and some of the early Earl W. Emerson mysteries, I don't read all that much crime fiction, so for me to enjoy this book so much is really saying something.  It has been a long time since I enjoyed a book this much.  Thanks, Mr. King.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I bought this to add to my collection since it was a favorite of mine as a kid, and I knew my daughter would love it too.
B0085OEA9U|5.0|This movie is a Clooney classic. I have 3 favorite Clooney movies I can watch again and again - Up in the Air, The Descendants and The Perfect Storm.
B00003CWRX|5.0|This was based on the true story about the tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand who turned in testimony to the court of Mississippi about the practices of the tobacco industry of boosting tobacco's impact and enhancing the plant's ability to be addictive by adding chemicals such as ammonia during the manufacture process. With the issue of the legalization of marijuana coming to the public's attention, this should be a concern for everyone who is concerned about this issue.  With amazing performances by heavy hitting actors and issues concerning the FDA and the influence that big business has on the press, this film is still as important today, maybe more so, as it was when it was released in 1999. Possibly my favorite film ever.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this TV series - it feels like a mini-series as the filming is extremely high quality and acting is superb.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Aside of the fake 5* reviews for the app from the developer, since the day I got it, I've been having problems with the app giving me false readings. Evenright now, where my phone has been connected to my charger all night, this app is telling me that my charge level is eight percent. Seems like a simple thing to program, and for that being all this app is really supposed to do, and for doing it so poorly, one star review. Easy. Spend your dollar elsewhere.
B008Y5OWO8|5.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time. I first saw it in Japan in 1953 or 54 (no subtitles). I knew almost none of the language. My companion had seen it and she explained the plot before-hand, so I was able to follow it. I have watched it many times since. Partly due to two of the finest Japanese actors; Toshiro Mifune and Machiko Kyo, not forgetting Takashi Shimura who went on to the lead Samurai role in 'Seven Samurai'.<br />The Blu-ray transfer is outstanding. The sharpness and contrast are beautiful. Machiko Kyo never looked better (except in color, as in Gate of Hell).<br />I always like the simulated torrential rain in Japanese films. If you've spent sufficient time there, you have probably experienced the real thing.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Cant believe how good this game is. Probably going to recommend this game to everyone i knowVery very good. Very good. Good
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game. It's fun and comical and easy to pick up and play. my only complaint is how fast you use up energy so you can't play for long periods of time. the farming mechanics are good and the quests are pretty fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very fun and the game gets harder. I love it because it is free. You get free stuff like a hoverboard,and a suit that you can get. Everyone should get it because it is free. Everyone will love it. If they don't,then they are WEIRD. That is my explanation for this FREE game. Thank you!!! (Oh and this game is called Subway Surf.)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Overall, this was an interesting, engaging read. It is not the best I've ever read, but as a parent it asked a lot of interesting questions. I read it for a book club, and I think it will garner a lot of good discussion. I knew there was a twist, but did not expect it- so that always makes a book more enjoyable.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I liked the way/point-of-view from which the story was told. The ending took me completely by surprise! I would recommend the book to my book club.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Recommended by a friend and having heard good things about Orson Scott Card I decided to give this book a shot. It definitely lived up to its reputation.

B009CZTDE8|5.0|Tuomas Holopainen's deep love (and considerable talent) for instrumentals and more complex song arrangements has been years in the making. I'm not well-versed in every single Nightwish song, but the ones I like best are usually big orchestral songs (\\"Ghost Love Score,\\" \\"Meadows of Heaven,\\" etc.). After some years of waiting, he finally had a chance to really indulge in these skills and we are blessed to get an entire album of orchestra-heavy songs here!<br /><br />Strictly speaking, this isn't an instrumental album (it does still use choral harmonies and sometimes a children's choir, not to mention Annette on \\"Deeper Down\\"), but this is still very different from normal Nightwish fare because many tracks don't use any typical band instruments (or only use them sparsely). Brash metalheads with short attention spans might be bored by this music or say it's too maudlin and dramatic. Maybe that's true, but it IS a soundtrack, after all, and it suits a film very well.<br /><br />I'm not even going to single out specific songs for very long because I thought they were all strong tracks. The music box on \\"Find Your Story\\" is a haunting opening sound. We hear remnants of \\"Meadows of Heaven\\" recycled in \\"Sundown,\\" but it's so pretty that I don't mind hearing it reincarnated. \\"Wonderfields\\" has some lovely piano sections, and \\"Heart Lying Still\\" is likewise a marvelous piece of piano craftsmanship.<br /><br />Please know that \\"Deeper Down\\" is basically \\"The Crow, the Owl, & the Dove.\\" Since I have not listened closely to the original, perhaps they are different in instrumentation somehow in a way that I don't see right now.<br /><br />Of VERY worthy note is the 8-minute mastodon \\"I Have to Let You Go,\\" which is something of a crowning glory. It is alternately thrilling, harrowing, uplifting, and just plain exciting. This piece would not be out of place in a \\"Torchwood\\" episode.<br /><br />Pip Williams should be duly noted for his arranging skills. The songs strike me as beingall-or-nothing, as if they were either going to be fantastic or barely tolerable, so the choice of arranger was beyond crucial. These songs crackle and hum with epic tension, and I'm sure his efforts added considerably to the final sound of these tracks. James Shearman also gets kudos for conducting the excellent Looking Glass Orchestra (never heard of them, but they clearly know what they're doing).
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed the ending but it was long.  I would have liked to see a confession from Jacob and maybe one more chapter to finish the story.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good puzzles, good hidden objects, just stared playing but pretty go so far.  Good brain game.  Worth downloading and trying!
B009YQJ322|4.0|If you can stomach yet another dystopic, post-apocalyptic sci-fi film, DREDD improves on its onscreen predecessor, the one that had Stallone uttering one of his most quotable lines ever. Stallone's [[ASIN:1558908846 Judge Dredd]] is fun in a cheesy sort of way. My main nitpick with it is that Stallone pretty much discards the Judge's helmet, something which you historically never ever see Dredd without. Judge Dredd in his core represents a police state. In the comics we never quite get to know him on a personal level, never really see him off duty. All he ever does is enforce the law impersonally. He always has that helmet on. When Stallone strayed from this, he lost me.<br /><br />In this bleak future, America is an irradiated wasteland, our planet become a Cursed Earth. Set in the eastern seaboard, Mega-City One stretches from Boston to Washington, DC, home to \\"800 million people living in the ruin of the old world and the megastructures of the new one.\\" In the face of increasing overpopulation and rampant crime, as society decays, the Judges - these men and women of the Hall of Justice - must be unflinching in carrying out their duties. They act as judge, jury, and executioner. Judge Dredd is heard to spout an alarming stat: \\"12 serious crimes are reported every minute, a sum of 17,000 per day.\\" Dredd goes on to say that the Judges can only respond to 6% of these calls.<br /><br />It chronicles a day in the life of Judge Dredd. It finds him saddled with a rookie partner, Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby). Anderson's test scores were marginal at best, and she wouldn't even have gotten this far in the training except that she's that rare powerful psychic. Dredd is tasked with evaluating her under field conditions. As such, Dredd and Anderson are dispatched to the residential mega-block of Peach Trees to investigate a brutal triple homicide in which the victims were also deskinned.<br /><br />Odds are these following fun facts aren't in Peach Trees' tourist brochures: The mega-block houses 75,000 registered citizens; It flaunts the highest crime rate in Sector 13; it boasts an unemployment rate of 96%; it's widely regarded as the most dangerous district in Mega-City One.<br /><br />Peach Trees comprises 200 floors, is run with vindictive efficiency by Madeline Madrigal or \\"Ma-Ma\\" (Lena Headey), a crime boss bent on expanding her territory thru sales of Slo-Mo, a dangerous reality-altering drug. Slo-Mo presents us with the film's most striking special effects as enough moments unfold as seen from the addicts' drastically slowed down perspective. The Slo-Mo cam elevates John Woo's slick bullet ballet to even more exaggerated extremes.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way, DREDD takes on that [[ASIN:B000O77SRC Die Hard]] premise, that [[ASIN:B008ULRY78 The Raid: Redemption Unrated]] premise. A chain of events eventually compels Ma-Ma to implement full lockdown protocol on the Peach Trees complex, trapping Dredd and Anderson inside with their prime suspect. Ma-Ma then gets on the speakers and commands her tenants to hunt down the Judges. The only thing she doesn't do is play \\"The Rains of Castamere\\" on the air.<br /><br />Quoting JUDGE DREDD artist/co-creator Carlos Ezquerra as he comments on how society has shifted to a darker, more cynical outlook: \\"In those times (**the late 1970s when Judge Dredd debuted**) he looked like a very futuristic figure. But today, 35 years later, any policeman looks like him now.\\" Back in the day Judge Dredd was THE semi-fascist boogeyman. Today, he's just another guy. Even the X-Men's Cyclops has got him beat in authoritarian excess.<br /><br />Karl Urban does what Stallone couldn't, which is make Dredd a serious, credible character. And he achieves that without ever relinquishing his Helmet of Intimidation. Another quote from Ezquerra: \\"Justice has not a face.\\" So credit Karl Urban for maintaining Dredd as an impersonal instrument of the law, someone so insanely dedicated he works only in absolutes, not so much in the grey areas. Urban must've been tempted to veer away from the Dredd aesthetics, maybe introduce an endearing emotional tic or two. Good on him that he refrains. I never ever want to see Judge Dredd crack a smile.<br /><br />I liked Stallone's version up to a point, but I love this reboot, love the post-apocalyptic vibe of it. It's violent, sometimes graphically so. The acting doesn't succumb to cheese. Lena Headey is wonderfully detached as the damaged goods turned big bad. I even like the chemistry between Dredd and Anderson. And just when you least expect it, we even get a moment in the end in which Dredd demonstrates that he can, on rare occasions, break the rules.<br /><br />But, hey, Judge Dredd, Magneto called. He wants his helmet back.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- \\"Mega-City Masters: 35 Years of Judge Dredd\\" (00:14:26 minutes)<br />- \\"Day of Chaos: The Visual Effects of DREDD 3D\\" (00:15:20 minutes)<br />- \\"Dredd\\" - Karl Urban and the filmmakers' brief break down of what makes Judge Dredd tick (00:01:52 minutes)<br />- \\"Dredd's Gear\\" - a tutorial on Dredd's uniform and gadgetry (00:02:30)<br />- \\"The 3rd Dimension\\" - the 3D process behind DREDD (00:01:59)<br />- \\"Welcome to Peach Trees\\" - delves into the concept and set design of the Peach Trees mega-block (00:02:32)<br />- DREDD Motion Comic Prequel - recounting Ma-Ma's dark origins and rise to power (00:02:56)<br />- Theatrical Trailers, not so much in the grey areas.

B001DM1VXE|3.0|I found this movie to be OK.  I liked the B&W cinematography and the artsy feel of it but the story line felt incomplete with weak resolution.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I'd have to say.. Before reading this I was unsure if I would be able to finish it... I picked it up several months ago and read about 20% of it. Then I put it down for the longest time and read some other stuff instead. Recently I decided to give or another go and started over.. At first it was a bit slow I found but if you persist.past say..30%.. It gets harder to put down.. The horror genre has never much appealed to me especially books about vampires because I  thought I knew it all and that it'd be too predictable..anyway I was wrong..I learned that just because it is an old story and a classic... doesn't mean it'll bore you because you think you know the story already.
0345803507|5.0|very interesting though think I have had as exciting a life as described<br />without all the excess tools - nevertheless fast and interesting reading
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Just like any free game, Hill Climb Racing is both pointless and scarily addictive. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good way to pass the time on a trip or waiting at somplace.
B005NQ94KS|3.0|Not as exciting as the book read<br />but an enjoyable weekend movie<br />to kick back to - so overall quite nice
B000022TSY|4.0|Easy to believe that's the way a lot of people think-if you don't have a special roster your free-and if you're free you're a monster no one likes.A lot of my friends like the end,but I like the rest.
0345803493|5.0|Yes, it gets darker and more intense<br />keeps you on the edge of your seat or<br />bed - depends where reading occurs<br />But a fun fantasy
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|A lot of people know something about The Wrath Of Khan,but there wasw much more to Star Trek movies than just one movie's title. Besides,if you're a Star Trek fan,this is just right
0345803485|5.0|Kept us interested all the way - so have to<br />say an excellent writer who deserves all<br />the accolades attributed to her - interesting<br />and most women say they have experienced<br />a little of this grey..
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Great book, a story of true American heroes. I would defiantly recommend this book. The only down fall about it is the long chapters.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is the best app ever for a brony but for LITTLE girls its harder and watch if they buy anything
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Who says love isn't for everybody? Lovely story. Saw the movie first but I must say the book is as good as the movie. I kinda liked the turnout of the movie a bit more. It was more dramatic from my point of view. Nevertheless, I would recommend it to a friend.
1615238948|5.0|This book is amazing<br />It's a hard difficult story but told with such warmth- It leaves you with such a good feeling much like &quot;To Kill A Mocking Bird&quot;.<br />It's now on my all time favorite read list.<br />Do yourself a favor and indulge.  Very moving story.  I love books that are realistic and make you feel good at the end!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Perks of being a wallflower, an outkast... Wow, beautiful book. Saw the movie first but the book was so much better. I'm in love with Charlie and Patrick. &#34;We accept the love we think we deserve&#34;
1609611543|3.0|It was informative but too technical, sometimes boring to read. I appreciate the authors knowledge and effort but, I lost interest and began scanning the chapters for information I wanted to know.
006220629X|5.0|Zafon's first book, \\"Shadow of the Wind,\\" made me plan my next vacation in Barcelona, and Barcelona became my favorite European city (happily, the Barcelona of today not quite as gothic and mysterious as in Zafon's novels).  Then \\"Angel's Game\\" added a new central character, David Martin, to those already established.  Now comes \\"Prisoner of Heaven,\\" which--while quite clearly is serving as a bridge between the first two books and a forthcoming follow-up in the series--is still pretty damn good. Nobody, I've found, infuses sense of place with a touch of magical realism like Ruiz.<br /><br />This book focuses on Fermin, the colorful character from earlier works. I found myself completely absorbed in his tale, and was sorry when the book ended (particularly since it ends in somewhat of a cliffhanger).  The Cemetery of Forgotten Books plays only a minor role in this tale, but the stage is set for a more prominent role once again in the next book. Also, this is not so much a tome on writing, as were the author's first two in the series, but it is still a beautifully crafted novel with exceptional imagery and a lyrical writing style.  One thing, though: although the author says this is a \\"stand alone\\" story, it really helps to re-familiarize yourself with the first two books in the series. You will better relate to some of the characters and appreciate the many references to those works that appear in this one.<br /><br />For a space holder, if it's fair to call it that, \\"Prisoner of Heaven\\" still rates five stars.  I can hardly wait to read Zafon's next.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|I love this movie! I saw it in theaters two nights in a row and I wanted to see it again! This movie is amazing. I love the Fast and Furious movies so I had to see this when it came to theaters. Everyone should see it. It has action, comedy, romance, and sadness. So good. My mom loved it too. I will be buying this when it comes out on DVD. Can't wait for the 7th one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like puzzle games. I've gotten through the first ten levels and have enjoyed a bit of mental exercise. Hope to have more levels to play.

0142001104|3.0|This book was a required purchase for my Master's class and has tons of articles written by everyday educators and higher level administrators. It was very insightful for my purposes.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|My 5 and 7 year olds have watched it several times. I was worried it would be the exact movies that were in the Lego Batman video game, but they said it was not the same so they were entertained. The minifigure is a nice bonus.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|A good, free game. Not too cheesy and has potential to grow, but good for all ages. I would recommend it for younger ages mostly.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|How can one do justice to a Neil Gaiman book? They're all poignant,  lyrical, scary, stunning. The adjetives are as Endless as the feelings his novels inspire. Suffice it to say, one cannot read his work and remain unchanged. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is no exception.
B003ASLJMW|5.0|Well, again, not &#34;Dirty Harry&#34;, but this movie, Clint ends up with the Russians trying to steal this stealth plane. Of course, Clint battles the bad guys and ......well I will not spoil it for those Eastwood fans that have not seen this movie.<br /><br />Mike.
B000SEHJGQ|2.0|It took several chapters to begin to see that it is a very sad tale about a little boy growing up in very disfunctional family. Perhaps men who grew up during the depression of the 1930's can relate to it but I have given up and will not finish. Sorry.
0061900656|5.0|Added this to our son's &#34;Big Brother Survival Kit&#34; when his little sister was born, and he loves reading it to her now!  Honestly, it is probably better suited to the younger new sibling (ours was 7 when the new baby was born) but it still served its purpose, and he felt a very big part of the new addition!  Plus it's cute, and it makes the average, overly-hormonal new mom cry when she reads it too!
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|I found this very hard to get into. A lot of characters to remember and keep track of.  But persevered as I was told it was a good read.  Really clad I did.  The next two books are even better.
B00887490Y|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much and despite what others have said, I liked the ending.  There were twists that I enjoyed and it did make you think.  The very heart of this story (the reasoning behind it all) I can relate to ... I have had conversations with others regarding our children (without revealing too much of the story).
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Loved every bit of it.  It is a shame there will be no more books.  Interesting how they do things in Europe.  No one is trusted.
B00APYKXFS|5.0|If you're intelligent enough to figure out how to boil water, you should have no problem figuring out the objective of this game. The enemies are the same color as you because touching them doesn't harm you, the real threat is their bullets which fill the screen! If the enemies were a different color it would distract you from the bullet dodging. Blowing up enemy ships releases energy which can be collected to use your Anti Gravity ability, or saved up for some sort of awesome overdrive. People just gave this game 1 star because they couldn't figure out something that I was able to pick up on 2 minutes into the Test Drive. Cool game, good graphics, decent music and today its FREE! People will complain about anything I swear.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|A book for everone to read. Very hard to put down. Loved it.  Very different in Europe than in NZ.
B00B00RJJO|5.0|Tooth and Nail is a great new album by Billy Bragg. I love the song Goodbye Goddbye. whole alnum is great
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Great sounds - don't use it without headphones if someone else is trying to watch tv. I like the graphics.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I was never able to get the audio.:(  So,I rented it at Redbox, had audio, and thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|As a pro photographer who also regularly teaches lighting I can highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to truly understand the nature of  photographic  lighting.<br />This book is superbly written by an expert who definitely knows his subject. The book is also lavishly illustrated with excellent images that directly support the text  and add to the readers understanding-  Many books on photographic lighting present page after page of lighting setup and recipes without providing any real understanding of why and how they work; this book teaches you what you really need to know to make your own setups  and recipes. It is head and shoulders above the rest.  If you only buy one book on lighting make it this one!
B00B2166BS|3.0|Title says it all. Magnetic connector is brilliant and works great but the cable is only three feet long.  Needs to be at least four feet  but yes it works just fine.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Just download it ........trust me it's the bomb and free? Wow I love FGOl. We can't put this addictive game down . I should have never do it. I can't get anything done :)
1781162646|5.0|this was a good, old fashioned mystery story with a great side story, and I never guessed the ending this time
B00APYKXFS|1.0|Do the developers ever play their games, this is terrible.<br />Gameplay is hard due the terrible graphics and color scheme, who makes the enemies and player ship the same color.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Another page turner from Clancy.  Just enough factual material and hard facts to make the story seem more real than most in this genre.  Clancy has a knack for blending education while never diminishing the entertainment value.
B001EYK54W|5.0|This original version of the Thomas Crown Affair is a must have for anyone who enjoyed the remake, but is curious if the original is &#34;better&#34;. My opinion is that both are equally as entertaining especially as the stories are different despite the concepts being the same. And McQueen doesn't have to try hard to be Tommy Crown, the role fits him like a glove. I love it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read this book very quickly. Very sexy. Entertaining. I look forward to finding out what happens next with Gideon.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The books became increasingly realistic and political as the third book continued with a contrast of the rebels with the established government.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This book is light hearted and funny  that was enjoyable and easy to read . The main character is so endearing and likeable in the strangest of ways ! The story line is easy to follow and it is the kind of book you can just pick up and read where you left off without having to go back and remember all that has happened before . Enjoy !!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This app helps me a lot. I can see my battery life percentage and how long i have for certain activities. I love the fact that it will tell you how long it has to charge also.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really want update 6 but why do we only get half of the stuff the x-box minecraft does, I mean we paid 7 bucks to get it and now we only half of the stuff we wanted.
B007N31YQ6|5.0|The film was very well done. Julia Roberts is an awesome actress in her portrayal of Erin. For an older film you can't beat it...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I loved every min of this story. I felt sad, happy, mad, and so in love with the characters.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Interesting book very very sad who would have thought that would happen in the  end like I said really sad
B00845MRKE|5.0|the best sci fi movie ever. nothing more to say. the fact that it has come back to the theaters 3 times and still holds its own is beyond amazing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Addictive!! I can't stop playing and escaping from each room. Progressively harder but the clues are there. You will enjoy it.
6305428050|5.0|Love this movie. always have. now having it on DVD is just that much better. 80's rock! Shue was very cute too!
B000HZEPAE|4.0|Although it is not politically correct, it provides an entertaining satire on America, her role in world politics, and the role of celebrities within America on global politics. Make sure anyone easily offended is out of the room, crack open a few beers or mixed drinks, and get ready to have some laughs.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love the way you can connect to facebook. there is always something to do on it. I love the battles that there are. worth the extra storge.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|This is the story that got me in to Batman.  It is a cold future that has moved beyond the need or desire for superheroes.  THe world is cold and cynical, and gangs are running wild over Gotham.<br /><br />The Batman has not been seen in decades, and Bruce Wayne decides as an old man to make him come back.<br /><br />This is the conclusion of the story that starts with the tired, old, broken Wayne taking up the cowl again and setting a world that doesn't know it needs him right.  This story features Batman kicking Superman's butt, too, so that is worth the price of admission.
B005DJRD80|4.0|It is an addictive show. I like Valerie the guidance counselor. Lots of funny lines in this show. Reminds me a lot of Felicity which I also watched voraciously. Cant resist a love triangle ...most good Rom coms are founded on that premise ....
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I absolutely love the book The Hobbit.  I was actually scared to see this movie because i was afraid they'd ruin my childhood memories.  I've read the book multiple times, seen the animated features a bunch of times, seen this as a play, and listened to the radio drama until I burned out my cassette player, so I am heavily vested in the story.<br /><br />I started the movie and was taken back to when I was 7 and listening to the story every day with the opening narration: \\"In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit\\".  I watched this wide eyed and slack jawed for the entire movie, all of my doubts washed away.  The scenery is beautiful, the acting superb, and the music epic.<br /><br />The only compliant I would have  is the orcs didn't sing and taunt the dwarves in the fir trees, one of my favorite parts of the book, along with their howls of disappointment when the eagles rescue them.<br /><br />I even understand them making azog not being dead, because they needed a main enemy to be pursuing, not the generic orc party in the book.
B00APYKXFS|5.0|Not sure why this got so many one stars its a very good games with great controls and its just fun to play. Its not perfrdct but hopefully he'll update it.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This is the best movie video game ever made, and one of the best movies of all time.<br /><br />The story is great, why can't the bad guy be the hero once?<br />the references to classic video gaming are fun to find, and the jokes are great for kids and adults.  The animation is nice and candy land is beautiful.<br /><br />The rules of the video game world were pretty interesting too: if you die outside your game, you never regenerate etc..<br /><br />This movie is worth every penny, and more.
030789701X|5.0|This is an awesome guide is well detailed down to the dlc section of it... I recommend it to anyone thats a Skyrim fan.
B00BGIC3T6|2.0|This movie seems more like a snapshot of a week in a family's life than a story.  Was the birthday party supposed to be the plot?  Was it the record company?  I just couldn't' tell you, it felt like there was nothing to resolve by the end of the movie, just a couple having a bad week.<br /><br />The iPad scrabble pooping scene was funny though.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is the easiest calculator to use. The large numbers are easy on the eyes. Plus it is free,you can't beat that :)
B000002P2V|5.0|Just like my recent RUN-DMC purchase...this one is a no-brainer. Get the WHO now while supplies last and prices are low.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|i grew up watching les mis on broadway. Loved this movie! Some of the actors can't sing but certainly not anne hathaway!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This has been one of the most entertaining shows I have ever watches.  I fell in love with these people.  Is there going to be another series.  If there is, I will surely want to watch it.  It is very well written and the characters just come alive.  I found myself laughing with them and crying with them because they are all so human-nothing fake about it.
B001IF252M|5.0|works well! Apple products are always pricey and expensive (that is my beef with Apple), but the product works well.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined in you continued to be a great read. Couldn't put it down until I read the last page.  Satisfying ending.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I love Sophie Kinsella books! They are witty and a quick read.  This is book is no exception.  If you have loved her other books, you will love this as well.  It had me laughing out loud in places and took me a couple of nights to finish.  My only issue is it took me only 2 nights to finish the book and now I'm left waiting for the next book from Kinsella!
B004N66XYE|5.0|I enjoyed the era that this movie was based on , the characters made the movie believable and surreal. waiting for series 2
0316247545|4.0|I like the first bit of the book. All the design elements, behind-the-scenes, concept art, and staff statements. But you could've gone into much more detail about more ponies, update certain designs (use Season 2 Luna for Celestia's sake!), and listed the episodes much more concisely. I love having all the official song lyrics, but that's about the only thing I like at the back of the book.<br /><br />I do have to say I love the hard cover. It's stable and so artistically designed. Having quotes of various mane characters inside the cover's front and back is also nice. Having the whole book in full color is wonderful but I feel they squandered that a little.<br /><br />But still, brohoofs all around.
B000RZIGZ4|1.0|Not sure why,but the disc doesn't play. Love this movie, but wish I could watch it... Fast shipping, but product isn't working
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I downloaded this book after my daughter told me she really enjoyed it and I have to say that I'm glad I did! I am reading the 4th in this series and the story still has me interested and anxious to see what is next. Cassandra Claire is an amazing author and is now one of my favorites :)
B000UPGQQW|4.0|Entertaining movie! Fun to see all those familiar faces! Cult classic for sure!! This one should be remembered for a long time!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughters absolutely love this game! They are 6 and 9 and both enjoy it very much... It is a winner in our house:)
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Yes you saw the movie in the theater but this is a page for the bluray, which is not out yet.  The purpose is to rate the product you purchased off amazon, not review the movie.  Also can you please stop posting spoilers with your reviews?  Lots of us have not seen this movie yet so thanks for being a jerk.  The whole point is if you wanna be cool and have people think you are some movie critic then review the movie on a blog or appropriate review page.  Don't go on amazon and write a movie review with spoilers on a product that has not actually been released yet and you are not even rating the product.<br /><br />Thanks
B003I4LF3G|5.0|wow true story no one would believe really happened but did, I loved Anthony Hopkins. John Hurt, remarkable with all the prosthetics he was unrecognizable, but that did not detract from his fine performance you really believed you were looking at the real john merrick
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Superb setting and authenticity, characters and character development, and acting.  Thank you for an extraordinary series!  I'm thoroughly addicted.  When does it begin again?!
B0019LZV4E|5.0|Depp and Bonham are super stars alright.  this was a great adaptation of the play.  such<br />remarkable twists and turns, I knew Bonham could sing but Depp? splendid just splendid. superb cast suburb writing
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Great way to finish the story. I'm glad that Lena and Alex made up. Though I liked Julian, I didn't want to see him with Lena. Maybe he could run into Hana and they could be paired.:)
B0090XLDKY|3.0|I just received the 2-disc DVD edition of \\"Singing in the Rain\\" this morning (on the day of this review). I was so excited about getting my first Gene Kelly film in DVD format, that I tore open the plastic wrap that covered the DVD without thinking of inspecting the item first.<br /><br />After tossing the shredded plastic wrap, I found out that a large chunk of the plastic case was chipped off along it's spine (the spine side which you can pry open the case), leaving a one inch trapezoidal hole. I was so dismayed by the obvious defect of the case that I immediately regretted opening the plastic wrap before inspecting the product. As it turns out, the missing shard of plastic was clattering inside the case the whole time. I don't know if the seller, Amazon.com LLC wrapped this DVD with the one inch hole on the case without being aware of it before shipping it off, but the box was decently padded with air filled plastic within the cardboard box that it arrived in... I can't really conclude anything about this however.<br /><br />Even worse, I can't even return the product after reading through Amazon's return policy. Since this DVD has been unwrapped (by my own impulse, unfortunately), the DVD is not eligible for a return. My only consolation for now, is I can still watch \\"Singing in the Rain\\" to cheer me up. But fellow Amazon shoppers, please don't forget to inspect your delivered items before opening it - it might just save you from complete disappointment and regret.<br /><br />(Note that the film itself was not the one that deserved 3 stars - the condition of the case and whole experience of finding out that I can't return it was what I rated. The film itself would be given 5 stars,and is highly recommended for fans of musicals or those who appreciate dancing choreography.)
B00004YA66|5.0|I liked because of it's acting, I thought both Quaid and Cazievel were excellent. The idea of the story was simply fantastic.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Its so CUTE. You raise monsters and take care of them.Then u battle other cute monsters. There's different island and different opponents. Again SO COOL!!!!!!
0887306101|4.0|What do all top traders have in common? Control of their emotions. Master your emotions, or at least learn how to manage them, and you can make money in the market. Market Wizards does a great job of showing us the mind behind some of the top traders in the world. It does not show you what or how they do it, just how they get out of their own way. Learn from your mistakes, have a plan, and stick to it. Very easy read and a nice book to start with if you plan on investing in the market.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game just the perfect amount of challange. i just wish there were more levels. I can not  wait for the update.

0393337170|3.0|A key game theory lesson is to put yourself in the other player's shoes, taking into account their objectives and strategies. These interactions are either sequential or simultaneous; sometimes (eg. football) there is an element of both.<br /><br />The first rule of strategy for sequential-move games is that each player should figure out the other players' future responses and use them to calculate his own best current move. (You have to know what they know and not know what they don't - firms sometimes hire outsiders to play the role of the other players.) A tree diagram of the choices sometimes helps; a good free computer program for assisting with more complex situations is 'Gambit). Greater freedom of action for a player can hurt - eg. a president having a line-item veto) by dissuading the other party (Congress) from passing a combination of items, some desired by Congress and others by the President - the possible result is to leave both worse off than with a combination in which both win.<br /><br />When a simultaneous-move game has a player's best choice being the same regardless of what the other player(s) choose, it simplifies analysis and is referred to as a dominant strategy. If you have a dominant strategy, use it.<br /><br />The prisoners' dilemma is an even more special game - both (or all) players have dominant strategies (confess; lower prices) and both do worse pursuing them than if they could have credibly agreed that each would use the other, dominated strategy (no confess; keep high prices). Successful cooperation is much more likely with fast detection of cheating. Example: Airlines constantly monitor each other's fares and can respond very quickly. In other situations, firms can cut prices in secret deals or hide those cuts in complex deals with many dimensions such as delivery time, warranty, quality, etc. Bid-rigging has often resulted - eg. high or low bids according to the day of the month the bid was issued, use of local area-codes as the last digits of one's bid to signify determination to win a particular sequence of bids. Detection of price cuts, especially in retail sales can be simplified and retaliation made quick and automatic by 'match or best' policies that make customers the detectives. \\"Tragedy of the Commons' situations include overfishing, overgrazing, and global warming - all are multi-person prisoners' dilemmas.<br /><br />Then it's on to Nash Equilibrium and the book just falls apart into endless much ado about nothing that is useful for management strategists.last digits of one's bid to signify determination to win a particular sequence of bids.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|Really liked this book.  It's like reading connected mini-novels.  It was very interestesing waiting to see how the next chapter would connect with the previous- how the relationships intertwined.
B004EPZ084|3.0|This movie is hilarious and reasonably priced. You won't regret buying this flick. It's not Oscar worthy but it's sheer entertainment.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|Interesting movie with good performances and an unbelievable plot that is hard to believe at points. Enlightening with great scenery but leaves you wondering what the point is at the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I very much enjoyed The Hunger Games; it created a unique civilization and reminded me a bit of  the books The Giver and Gathering Blue.  The highest compliment I can pay is to say that I will now look forward to reading its sequels.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|My kind a suspense and entertainment. Am reading another book by this author and will get more as I finish.
1118109791|4.0|I like the book very much. it helped me a lot. But it would have been even better if the integrated reasoning exercises didn't have time limit.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|*******SPOILERS**********<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book, truly.  I was drawn into the book almost immediately and was excited to spend my time reading it until I got about 10 chapters in.  I began to feel like there was zero character development other than Deans multiple personality disorder and major anger issues.  I hated that five and six year old children sounded more like a ten or twelve year old in dialog.  Six was almost completely lost to the story and Sky's \\"gay Mormon\\" BFF just had no purpose what so ever in the story.  I absolutely hated that Sky and Dean coped with sexual abuse by....having sex.  I could not stand the fact that Sky was abused sexually and watched her father kill himself and they just ran away and had sex within the hour in their hotel room.  No adults, no authorities, nothing.  A girl was sexually abused by her father, was kidnapped, and witnessed her father kill himself and the book ended with a happily ever after and a boy ordering his girlfriend to get on birth control.  There is nothing romantic about that.  I could go on and on.  The serious matter of this book coupled with the serious lack of realism when it comes to such extreme issues makes this a horrible read for young adults and teenagers.  I just don't understand the five star reviews.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's fun but some things require a lot of gems. It is very easy to train your horses and is not hard at all. Great game.
0060873175|4.0|I don't understand all the bad reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I certainly was intrigued by the world below our feet that we don't give a second thought to unless you are as small as an ant, then the world around you can be very scary.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Over and over and over again, James Altucher never fails to enlighten, entertain, and quite simply provide the best damned advice offered by just about anyone alive on the planet today. No matter what particular situation you may happen to be going through in your life, James' advice never fails to inspire.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I love how Zusak writes. Easy to follow and visual. That the narrator as Death himself is especially intriguing. Will recommend to everyone!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Make sure you have some time available if you want to start watching this dark twist on the billionaire vigilante story.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Definitely up to the same standard we've come to expect from Khaled Hosseini. Beautifully written and a joy to read.
0316743003|5.0|For anyone who loves building the best of anything, especially interesting things like weapons, this book is an easy, fun read.  One must hope that we will be lucky enough now and in the future to have such successful product development in all things, hopefully good things.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I did enjoy the book, but of the 3, my favorite remains &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;.  I would read more by this author.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|In fairness, I unknowingly paid more than retail price for this item from Amazon.com. Apparently it was rare or &#34;collectible.&#34; I just saw the number of pieces in the set and thought it was a reasonable value. What I did not know is the thing was TINY. Most pieces were less than a cubic centimeter in size. The box it came in was about an 8&#34; cube, not what I expected when looking at the picture and considering the number of pieces. When the package arrived from Amazon, I set the small box aside, thinking it was something else. My son did like it, but felt like I got taken.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I love music & always want to know titles & artist names.  This is a wonderful tool....oops...App. I would AND have recommended it to others

0062278592|4.0|Gaiman scores another triumph with this coming of age tale of a 7-year-old boy who finds true friendship in an 11 year-old girl. The plot is neither complex nor particularly groundbreaking. But if you are familiar with Gaiman's stories, you will find that the magic in them is sort of a given, and what separates this novel from countless other fantasy tales about a boy who faces supernatural forces larger than he can handle, is the way the magic is so intricately woven into Gaiman's story universe that when you encounter it, you almost miss it because it is so unobtrusive, and most important, believable.<br /><br />In some ways an allegorical look at how a child views the adult world and its cunning complexities and inconsistencies, this is best exemplified in a pivotal scene when our unnamed protagonist faces his new nanny, who reveals herself to be more than just uncommonly sadistic and mean: \\"Ursula Monkton smiled, and the lightnings wreathed and writhed about her. She was power incarnate, standing in the crackling air. She was the storm, she was the lightning, she was the adult world with all its power and all its secrets and all its foolish casual cruelty\\".<br /><br />Gaiman does child narratives best, and sometimes I marvel at how accurately he inhabits the skin of children, such that when he writes about a child's belief in basic things like loyalty and courage, it resonates with the heart and soul of childlike conviction. For example, when the boy speaks of his complete trust in Lettie Hempstock, the mysterious 11 year-old with a soul as old as the hills, he says: \\"I believed in her, and that meant I would come to no harm. I knew it in the way I knew that grass was green, that roses had sharp, woody thorns, that breakfast cereal was sweet\\".<br /><br />This novel is proof that good stories need not always have long, complex narratives - they just need to be sincere, and when appropriate, a little bit of magic always help.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Kindle fire just makes reading on flipboard all that much better. The color screen and the flip UI just go well together.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|Saw this because a friend recommended it.... I must say I don't see the appeal. This movie made me NOT want to grow up at all... If everyone's life is like that at 40...maybe we should all just party until we wind up in the hospital EVERY NIGHT. If you're over 40....MAYBE this movie will appeal to you (but who wants to watch a movie about their life story anyway?) It was not my cup of tea..
B00459EZSU|5.0|I found this series to be the best in the SG lineup. Some people have commented on the slow pacing of Season 1 and far more character development than planet discovery and action. All this is true, and is exactly what made this series excellent sci-fi television. The first season is slowly paced on purpose, as a dissonant group of military and civilian personnel are thrown into an impossible situation; they don't trust each other; they don't want to work a long time with each other; and they all have different motivations for being on a mission that they didn't choose to be on. This makes for excellent inter-personal drama and great character development. The writers/producers pulled it off, and Season 1 was about exploring difficult relationships amidst desperate circumstances where anything can go wrong.<br /><br />Sadly, there are only two seasons to this series. Season 2 is full of action and planet discovery, but also has some great story lines, such as the reversal in time and the rise of a civilization based off the Destiny crew. These episodes were well done and even heart pulling. I was a little dissatisfied with the auto drone episodes being that they played such a big part and we never really knew where they came from and why they existed, other than just being an unbeatable enemy. They did provide the backdrop for an unusual round up for the season and the series, which ended really as a cliffhanger, only wetting your appetite for the more you know you would never get. Ironically, it actually made the series all the more dramatic, and allows viewers to make up their own mind on the possibilities. Like all great series though, I would have preferred one more season where certain story lines could find a better completion.<br /><br />The other SG series are fun, but they lack the psychological depth of this one. The others are more swashbuckling adventure tales; this one a heartbeat, psychological drama in space with three dimensional characters. It is closer to the Firefly series which is perhaps the best sci-fi on tv, and that series only got one season. Battlestar Galactica of course takes first prize for sci-fi epic, but it too ran into production problems, and its last two seasons were a mixture of writer strikes and desperate close-ups of story lines as the series was too expensive to make for cable, thus its final episodes had some glaring holes which were a necessary part of a quick clean up. Alas, the really good series seem to die young, leaving the bread and butter swashbuckling story lines the most prominent on tv, and the least intellectually and emotionally satisfying.<br /><br />If you enjoy sci-fi, give this series a try. Stay with it and you will be hooked. By the time it ends, your only disappointment is wanting more of this kind of excellent genre.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Fine recording by a fine artist.  I have always loved Johnny Cash and was happy to see this re-released CD.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|decent colors control and interesting, might even make some desktops for fun with it.  not mind blowing but it can be fun
B006QS07IK|5.0|The book arrived sooner than expected and it such pristine condition! The pages were so crisp and the binding not broken, my daughter was scared to be the first to read it. Since it is such a beautiful book we bought another one at a yard sale for her to take notes in and this one for her collection. Would definitely use Amazon again!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Love this CD!!! I bought this for my husband for Fathers Day, Much cheaper on Amazon than the retail stores and I didn't<br />t have to leave my house.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed the game, but I wish it were longer. Puzzles were challenging, but not too frustrating. Cant wait for new rooms!
B00CDJNHH4|5.0|I have tried to contact Amazon to fix this description -  This is not just a blu-ray/DVD but a re-issue of a  Digibook collectors edition that came out in 2012.  For the price, this is an outstanding edition to my collection.  Excellent picture along with 7.1 DTS Surround.  The audio was phenomenal on my audio system and the picture was vibrant.  Along with this you get a 42 page book with color pictures. Perfect for any JAWS collector.  Highly recommended since it is about 10-12 dollars cheaper than the previous release.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I keep extra copies on hand to give as gifts to women whenever I need a gift.  It's such an uplifting, forget your troubles kind of movie.  You'll love it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Enjoyed the book immensely. It was introspective without being  preachy.  Cheryl shares herself with the reader, allowing for the rewarding experience she gained, to transcend mere words on pages.
B009MYARIK|1.0|i kept reading hoping for a &#34;light&#34; summer read and all i found was a dreary novelette obviously meant to be a screenplay!  skip this one and, if it comes to it, skip the movie, too!
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|There has never been a better match!<br /><br />Good Movie, with a Good Twist I'm just hoping that they are working on a sequel.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|Good, but not great.  If it weren't for the 3d aspect, the movie would've gotten even less publicity.  It's one of those movies with zero closure.  It tells what happened, but not WHY it happened.  Some questions are finally answered at the very end, but just a couple.  This could've been a groundbreaker in the zombie genre, but it's more like Oliver Twist, asking \\"Please sir, I want some more....\\"  Mediocre, at best.  Rent it, don't drop $25 on the bluray.
B001JU6CGG|5.0|Great movie by Tom cruise!!! It will be good if you had more of his movies underneath prime for prime members to watch!!!
B001RE9HF2|5.0|excellent acting, voices were wonderful, and cleo was beautiful. I especially liked the humor of the production.<br />It couldn't have been better!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|keeps you guessing...its not as easy as it looks...I only wish there were more levels as I am really loving this game
B003B96AOW|4.0|This figure is very detailed and the articulation is good. The only real complaint I have is that some of the joints are loose. This prevents Deadpool from standing up straight and is unstable. A little bump is enough to knock him over.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Of was very reminiscent of Frontierville.  I really liked the little pioneer woman huffing and panting if you made her do a lot in a row.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm trying so hard to find the words to describe this beautiful piece of literature. I did all the cliché things one does when they read a spectacular book. I laughed, I cried, and I cried some more. I can easily say this is the greatest book I have ever read. I devoured this story in less than four hours flat well into the early hours of morning. Thank you so much John green for this ridiculously incredible story! Everyone MUST READ THIS BOOK!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have been playing for years in the simple form for relaxation and this form suits my speed. Two games and off to sleep. Good fun.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|For all ages, this is a great problematic solving exercise that helps to sharpen observation and memory. I love it! please add more levels soon!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it I would tell my friends to play it best game ever cause its more then one game to play
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It is jjst so freaking boring . It dont even got all the letters of the alphabet in it . What kinda s*** os that , DF -,- suck my s***
0553381687|5.0|If you are watching this on HBO, you might enjoy this book even better - what I love also is that there is no cursing and few(er) s*x scenes.  I like to see how the series follows the authors vision.
1400052181|5.0|As someone with some background in the health care industry, I cannot believe that I had never heard of Henrieta Lacks!  What an amazing story about the history of science, the creation of medical advances, and the story of an amazing woman.
B008035H16|3.0|A lighhearted storyof a great business sucess that seemed like it was achieved with the aim of being true to having a clear set of valiues and a clear cu;ture in mind.
B00881VLCE|2.0|This was one of my favorite apps. But the new update is the WORST!  It's so jerky my hand was cramping before I could get half way thru.  I like that it has the option for more pieces and the freebie puzzles are better. Totally irrelevant since I wont be playing this anymore unless the jerkiness is fixed.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Interesting story line with quick game play. Lots of special game pieces that carry over to subsequent rounds if not used in the round in which they are acquired.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Bought this album for a road trip. I had been thinking about buying it for a while. Blugrass on steroids. It is terrific. Warning!!Use your cruise control.This album causes \\"lead foot syndrome \\"
0143038095|5.0|I loved reading this book. It's beautifully written. The stories of these 4 Chinese women and their daughters were each very compelling in their own right. Each one can stand alone. Woven together as a complete literary piece, it was amazing. Their journeys from China to America, their sorrows, joys, their life stories, the two cultures, the mother -daughter relationship and all of its dynamics, both good and bad......and the ending... Oh my word...it brought tears to my eyes. A definite must read for any woman, we are all daughters, after all.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I was worried that it would not work with my Garmin navigation unit.  It worked perfectly.  In the past,  I have had some problems with being able to connect via USB with this type of an adapter.  Highly recommend it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|One of the best and most addicting games on Kindle. I've been playing it for hours and it keeps me coming back for more. It's like Jaws meets Feeding Frenzy. Lot's of incentives and upgrades mixed with spot on controls make for a very good game that will put a smile on your face. Try it and you'll be HOOKED. Get it?
B000JVSUS4|5.0|We watched this with the whole family - kids, grand kids over 8 - over Memorial Day and thoroughly enjoyed it. If you had family members in WWII, in either Europe or the Pacific, you'll appreciate this entertaining and dramatic look at the larger-than-life events and yet very ordinary people which defined this global, history altering conflict.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|It is not everyday that an author can write in a way that authentically describes what women feel and believe like Cheryl Strayed does in Wild. I found it to be highly entertaining and inspiring. I also learned a lot about hiking as a great bonus!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was very different for Mr. King.  I loved every minute of it.  As usual, he kept in in suspense right to the very end.  Some incredible twists and turns that I did not expect.  I was born in October of 1963 just before President Kennedy was assassinated.  I have always thought it was such a terrible and tragic loss of a very good President, husband, and father.<br /><br />It was kind of nice to think of him having survived that terrible day and wondering what all of the Kennedy's lives would have been like.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is pretty good to me to just entertainment and to pretend to take care of a real horse. But the graphics are pretty good and realistic.
B0018QQQK8|2.0|The story was so good, but then it all came crashing down in the last few pages.  I don't like at all the way Mr. Sparks ended this novel--not even sad, but  so unfair.  This man finally found everything he wanted in life, then to have it all snatched away in an instant--not my kind of ending to a pretty good story.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I thought this was a novel; it calls itself one on the cover, after all. It was a short story, basically. The kind that makes you think, &#34;Gee, this would be a good place to put a NOVEL.&#34;
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and fun, my husband and I truly enjoy puzzling out each level together. This puzzle game is quite addicting and it keeps us motivated to keep going, and it is not so difficult that it makes you want to just give up. Our grandchildren really love giving their ideas as well, sometimes it even helps.
159463176X|5.0|This is a great book. I was caught up in this story, of the constant struggle to survive. A real page turner.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|This is a must have movie for comedy romance viewers.  It's one that never grows old no matter how many times it's watched.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Best game paid or free. Hours of play. Tons of weapons, skills, armor, etc. Great graphics and sound. Wish more players were online.
B000FBJFSC|2.0|I didn't read this book when it was THE book everyone was reading. I just now purchased it for my Kindle, but if I'd checked it out at the library first, I could've saved myself some money. In my opinion, the author tends to go on and on and on about certain things. Just say your childhood was rough, give a few prime examples and be done with it. Or give another example so that you've described your rotten childhood twice, but more than that, and your work becomes redundant. There may be a great story under all the repetition, but I doubt I'll ever read it. I don't have the patience.
1781162646|5.0|Ok, I admit at first I was a bit peeved that I had to buy a non electronic version of this book. However, being a big King fan, I understood his vision and went for it.<br /><br />I am amazed that as he ages, Mr. King's writing becomes better and better. This book has the elements that you are familiar with; the well drawn main character, the ghosts, the suspense and a (surprisingly small) dash of gore. And of course, the reflections on human mortality that have crept into his books over the last four or five of them. What is different is the prose; it is absolutely beautiful. I had to stop and reread the line about the surf swirling like a hula a few times just to soak it in.<br /><br />The book is written from the point of view of a 21 year old boy/man, who becomes a carny for the summer and then stays on to nurse a broken heart. Most of us of a certain age have been there, and anyone who has ever had their head up their, well you know, over a first love will see themselves in this book immediately. Then comes the mystery, an unsolved murder of a young woman who supposedly haunts the house of horrors. There is the surprise. I expected a splash of King type gore after each page but it did not come, just a well drawn out suspense of the unseen. Interwoven with the plot is the protagonists' relationship with an ill boy and his mother. The big reveal in the end was not jaw dropping, but the suspense was played out very well, with some help from those with \\"sight\\".<br /><br />I recently moved to South Carolina and I understand the visuals behind the great descriptions of this book's setting of the Carolina coast. In fact, I saw tones of a certain other beloved author of the Carolinas in this work. I never thought I could put Nicolas Sparks and Stephen King in the same breath, but it really is true that Mr. King brought the Sparks Carolina romance to this book. His reflections on the relationships between the characters are very sweet, and I found myself drying my tearsas I read the last pages. It is a page turner and I gobbled it up in 24 hours. Bravo, and I hope that Stephen King continues to inject such depth and humanity into his next books.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The ending was soooooooo not ok! Both of these characters need years of therapy and I'm not sure that'll help.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|These episodes are incredible.  The acting, sets, costumes - all perfect...i.e. if you like shows made in the 60s!  We laugh and laugh.  The quality is very good.  I originally bought Season 1 on DVD, and the quality wasn't nearly as good.  It seemed the Blu-Ray set was cheaper than buying the remaining two seasons on DVD, so I actually bought a Blu-ray player as I bought this blu-ray set of all 3 seasons.  Very happy with the decision.  These are far better than the DVD set and cheaper.  Very happy with the purchase.  We are enjoying these a lot as a family.  Our teenage daughter is LOVING it!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I tore through this book in two days, couldn't put it down. The historical facts are well-researched and the character development is excellent, typical Ken Follett.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Speechless is the only word that comes to mind. This book has showed so many things I never knew someone could think of. Great book non the less.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I tore through this book right after I tore through Fall of Giants, in two days, couldn't put it down. The historical facts are well-researched and the character development is excellent, typical Ken Follett. I am sitting on the edge of my chair waiting for the third sequel in the trilogy.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Lincoln (2012) was directed by Steven Spielberg for Touchstone Pictures.<br /><br />It's January 1865 and President Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) is determined to see that Congress passes the Thirteenth Amendment banning slavery. Lincoln realizes passage of the controversial amendment will be impossible once the Civil War ends so he agrees to use every means necessary to achieve that goal.<br /><br />Day-Lewis gives an Oscar-winning performance as Lincoln. The strong cast includes David Strathairn as Secretary of State, William Seward, Sally Field (nominated for Best Supporting Actress) as distraught Mary Todd Lincoln, and Tommy Lee Jones (nominated for Best Supporting Actor) as abolitionist Republican Congressman, Thaddeus Stevens. The film also earned Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director.<br /><br />I found the story initially somewhat hard to follow. The  dialogue was painfully overwrought. However, it seemed like I was able to follow along more easily towards the end of the film. Day-Lewis and Field were great but Jones' performance was rather stiff and unremarkable in my opinion. Given today's political realities it was certainly an ironic twist to see Republicans fighting for the end of slavery and Democrats opposing them.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile film but it didn't create enough enthusiasm (yawn) for me to ever want to see it again.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It screwed up my Kindle Fire to the point I can't even play videos anymore from anywhere!  This one is a two thumbs down.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game .my husband really got into helping me escape the different floors . I can't wait for more floors to be added.  Betty

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun it's like taking care of a real horse I recommend that you get this app
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|It's rare to see a adventure movie that still believes in magic, and it's even rarer to see a fairy tale be done so well. Lot's of action in this movie, I thought the set up and the plot of the movie was very well done. I bought it for my movie collection.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Hate the new update. Go back to the old version. This is too slow and jerky. Before the update this game was a 10 star now its a 1 star.
B009K86D86|5.0|You should probably be more aware of what you are eating and how the foods we get are brought to the table.  It seems that we could have lost some great measure of safety and humanity for cheaper blander food.
1934030554|3.0|really good product with many usefull i nformation that make me understand what i wanted.i will buy and other products fromthe author
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I liked this book it was a little hard to understand some of the sayings that are in this book! But it is because of the slang sayings that t hey use Ireland. But I would recommend this book to someone else to read.
1469220725|5.0|Truely a great Adult Romantic suspense writer.  Her Crossfire Novel Series is a work of art not to be missed, if you are an Adult suspense romance reader.
B0015DWLD0|4.0|This novel is a fast and good read.  It isn't academic fiction--definitely pop fiction--but its best moments give the reader a better understanding of India today.  So for those interested in India, it's a must.
B000P0J09W|5.0|This was one of my Husbands favorite family movies.  A really good one for both Boys and Girls, Adults and Children.
B00821OX98|5.0|The story line is something that I'm sure a lot of people think about ... at least once in their life time. As big as the Universe is, it seems likely that there has to be other life out there somewhere! It's very good at portraying what I think we as humans would be like in a situation like this.
1400095204|4.0|This is a poignant story of a group of people both before and during the Nigerian civil war when Biafra had it's brief existence. The characters are well developed and you can relate to them. It was disappointing that Adichie felt she had to be so graphic with some of the violence as it was unnecessary for the story, but I still recommend this if you can handle that.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It's not as high clarity as my phone, but I am very glad to have it on my Kindle Fire. It is quite useful.
B003297I1U|5.0|I like the size and quality of that company toy trucks. I purchased it for my grandson and he loves his new truck.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Great way to pass the time.  Interesting levels with great graphics. Fun for kids and adults.  Can't wait for more levels!
B0000AKCLS|5.0|Buy it. Vocals are clean the gituar work is really his best ever. I listened 5 times when I got it home. Highly reccomend for your collection of the best blues ever. I would like to see him with Elvin Bishop. Now that I have seen Joe B in person. The CD is exactly like the stage performance.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love Sylvia Days books:)) I am in love with Gideon and Eva. I can't wait for the 4th installment of this series. I hope it comes out really quick!!
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|The two just rock together. Joe is amazing and helps Beth to greater heights and vocal range. Saw the video on youtube about that song by Tina Turner, 'Flatbush city limits'. Beth rocked it. Must buy!
B009NY43NY|2.0|Nowhere near as interesting as the first Sookie books and disappointed it ended this way. I would recommend the first part of the series.
B00A77II0U|5.0|It took a while to load, but when I opened it I could see why.  The graphics are AMAZING!!!  The mini games are different than usual and all different from each other.  They were innovative and FUN!  I usually find myself clueless on the games and use the &quot;skip&quot; button a lot.  But these were more fun and thoughtful rather than the same boring logic problems.  The one with the seed and the fire and watering can was my all-time favorite!  Keep them coming like this Alawar,  you've got my attention
030758836X|2.0|I like books that have redeeming value - books that highlight something curious about the human condition, that show you beauty where you thought there was none, that tell you about a culture you knew nothing about, or that give you insight about yourself, your family, your community, etc.<br /><br />The author of Gone Girl has astounding talent, there is no doubt about it. I was like a puppet in her skilled hands. I was taken in by her sharp edgy prose and I loved the suspense. But when I finished the last page, I felt like I had wasted my time. Gone Girl captured the worst in human nature and I don't need to spend any more time seeing how ugly human beings can be; I see that every day in the news. I read to learn something new and to become more thoughtful, more aware, and more sensitive. This book gave me none of that.<br /><br />This book has no redeeming value. I don't recommend it; read a more uplifting book instead.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Predictable outcome but the story woven around it was good. Would have liked a little more time spent on developing the emotional connection between the two.  Enjoyed the movie none-the-less.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|The one thing common in all of the songs on this album is that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are great storytellers, and while weaving a great story, they also infuse their raps with some interesting beats, instruments and rhythms. I found the whole album enjoyable.
B008JF8O9M|5.0|I have never written a review before, since I rarely enjoy trying to figure out how to use a new program.<br /><br />This one surprised me by being relatively simple to use.  And it did exactly what I needed and wanted it to do:  print from a telephone and tablet.  I was not able to print from the Android application on a regular computer and printer, but with a newer printer and this ap--it worked!!<br /><br />I am truly thrilled and amazed.  Thanks to anyone and everyone who made this happen.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Worth the read, although somewhat difficult to continue because of the language of the time. I enjoyed the classic story, even though  having heard it many times.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Can't wait for the next one in this series.  When will the next one be available?  Anxious to know the outcome.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|Cutting edge syfy with good acting and characters.  Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson, John Noble , and Kirk Acevedo keep the action going.  It's another great series created by J J Abrams.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging game. Highly recommended for puzzle lovers. Wish there were more rooms to escape but enjoyed those that were here
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My seven year old son and i had a blast finishing this game this afternoon!  This game has a sense of wonder about it; we eagerly await more rooms!<br />I hope this team of designers create more games that actually make you think and are challenging.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|I had seen snippets of this film in the past but had never gotten to watch the whole thing.  Finally, I got this DVD and had a ball watching this.  My wife initially refused to watch it with me but after a few minutes she said, &#34;What are you watching?&#34;, and when I told her she got hooked and thought it was hilarious.  It's fun watching the cameos of famous people and Jack is over the top in his dual roll.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Excellent read even after watching the movie first! A story that occurs more often than we know,but not often enough. Brought about many emotions, made me realize I need to wake up & appreciate every day, every moment, and every small yet sweet fleeting moments my husband & I share in our everyday lives! Hoping for a follow up short read to see where life leads this family.
0061251305|5.0|A book I could not put down. I told everyone I knew in any type of leadership role to read this book.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|My nephew loves this movie.  Not something I want to watch but as long as he is enjoying it that is all that matters.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Woody Allen is a genius with many outstanding movies to his credit. Midnight in Paris exceeds them all and is clearly the best movie in several years. I have seen it several times and learn something new each time. (the last scene of the private detective lost in time is priceless.)  Allen is my age and knows what is interesting and important to us. I know a great deal about the authors and artists of the 20's known as the  &#34;Ex Pats&#34;  Woody Allen does too.  May he live forever and make great movies.<br />!
B003QTWR08|5.0|Great movie. Funny and smart while being a reflection on humanity's consumerism. Looks fantastic in HD and can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What is there too say I love this book. I can't wait to read the next book. The author is absolutely wonderful this is a must read....
B000002J2F|5.0|This is the album that started my love of Genesis. From the moment that I heard Turn It On Again I was captivated by the sound and bought the album. Considering that up until this time my favorite band was Kiss , that`s saying something. After listening to Duke over and over , I proceeded to raid the public library of all the Genesis albums that they had. Sorry no internet in those days , you either borrowed someone`s album or went to the library to hear older albums. I remember the first time that I listened to Nursery Cryme  and was in awe of what I was hearing. So I have fond memories of Duke , since it set me on the path to becoming a huge Genesis fan. As for the actual album it is one of my favorite Genesis albums because it incorporates their past , but you can hear the future. I have always thought of this album as being influenced by the new wave music of the time , shorter , keyboard and guitar driven songs. I`m sorry but I have always considered Turn It On Again a New Wave song and that`s not a bad thing. Since this was my first exposure to a full Genesis album , having only heard The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway on the radio , the fact that I loved this album so much speaks volumes as to how good it is. I`m not big on song by song reviews so I will just say that this album captivated me as a 16yr old and I appreciate it even more at 49.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book.  I am glad I decided to read the book!  It does not compare to the movie.  Great writing, great characters, great plot . . . Just great!
B00AESN8XY|1.0|So I love this game and will change my review when I can actually play it. I bought it but when I go to play it it says that I do not have the right to play this game, and it automatically stops.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|Most blu ray movies run between 20 mbps to over 30 mbps. Regular dvds run about 5 mbps. These run between 5 mbps and 20 mbps, and average about 10 mbps. There quality is at the lowest end of the spectrum. These are from England. For instance instead  of  The Sorcerer's Stone, Its The Philosopher's stone. Even the script is different. I think that the quality specs in England are far less than here in the U.S. If you can make sure it's the U.S. version get, it if not don't.
1451695195|5.0|This is a good, easy to read book.<br />I think being written by a neurosurgeon is a plus.<br />I don't need this book to believe in life after death but for those<br />that do - this is good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really love mcpe, but the only bad thing it updates really late. I just wish the kindle fire hd would update like all the only android devices.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app!It is getting so close to the real thing by the update.Luckily I bought this when it was on sale for 3.99.I had just got $5 from Amazon.IF YOU HAVE A KINDLE FIRE READ THIS:If you press the button that turns your kindle fire on/off DONT PRESS IT WHEN YOUR PLAYING.YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO TURN YOUR KINDLE FIRE BACK ON.IT WOULD TAKE SO LONG FOR YOU TO TURN IT ON.BEWARE!!!!!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I just got this game and it is so fun. I love to play all the colorful levels. Each level throws in some new challenge. Time seems to slip away while I should be busy doing necessities instead of FUN! It is not hard and I even like the sounds when you make multiple matches. Runs perfectly and quickly on my Fire HD. I have not had any freezes or glitches. Great for the money.
0399157565|4.0|I've read all of Ms. Cornwells books and love them all. In my opinion, this one started a little slow but, I ended up engrossed and really enjoying it!
B00530FC6O|5.0|Like many, I discovered P.G. Wodehouse later in life, and so glad I did.  One of the most brilliant humorists of any generation.  It's not so much the plot (they're all pretty similar - Bertie in the Jeeves' series or Psmith or the Blanding's Castle cast or his other characters always get into some predicament involving eccentric relatives, on-again, off-again marriage plans, or some other harmless chicanery), but those of us who are devotees never tire of the brilliant repartee, characters, and humorous portrayal of the British landed gentry of the early 20th century.  All of the books are enjoyable, some more than others, but I have to say without a doubt that &#34;The Code of the Woosters&#34; is definitely the most laugh-out-loud brilliant humor/writing/reading experience I've had to-date from Wodehouse. Absolutely pitch-perfect.  Jeeves is at his finest, Bertie is either oblivious or in deep waters - often both at the same time. The range of characters is spot on - just the right touch throughout.  I strongly recommend this book, and guarantee Wodehouse devotees you won't be disappointed!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books in this trilogy were totally awesome. I would recommend them. I will reread them I am sure. They will remain in my library for future reading. I also will read more by this author. Awesome read.
B0006V6TMG|5.0|Fabulous concert! Sounds like the Jimi Hendricks of flamingo jazz. I would recommend this to anyone who like Carlos Santana as well.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|Everything about this movie is just about perfect, starting with Audrey Tautou. Besides her obvious good looks, her subtle facial expressions throughout the movie are hilarious and some are meant for whoever is watching the movie, rather than for a fellow actor. Be sure to check out the shoes she wears in every scene. The movie has elements of fantasy and whimsy woven into a somewhat off-beat romance (but, then, every character in the movies is a bit off-beat). The frequent voice-over is amusing and the cinematography is gorgeous, considering it's not a particularly scenic movie. I did not realize it had been nominated for a bunch of Oscars until after I had seen it. I'm not surprised.
B007SGM084|5.0|I chose to give 5 stars because it negated all I heard about it. It wasn't just about sex although there is a lot of it, but about a relationship and what we are willing to do or not for the one we claim to love. Can we truly love unconditionally? It was a lot to think about in terms of relationship and communication. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book should be read by everyone, especially the younger generation that don't know much about WWll.  It's a book that's hard to put down.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is a fantastic collision of video game styling with a modern outlook. It follows the graphic novels almost word-for-word, and if a scene from the book isn't in the final cut, you can find it in the deleted scenes.<br /><br />This was a gift for my best friend and this has been his favorite movie for a long time now. He just recently got an HDTV, so I purchased this BluRay copy, and the quality is fantastic. The special effects in this movie were made for BluRay. You can see every purposeful pixel, and every fiber on Ramona's sweater.<br /><br />After being fans of this movie and the graphic novel, purchasing the BluRay copy was the right decision.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|For starters, there's a terrible choice in colors, a yellow and an orange that are only a few hue values away from being exactly the same. Secondly, the con trolls are nonsensical. Its difficult to tell where your block is depth-wise, and to place a block, instead of just tapping on top of where you want to place it, you just end up akwardly dragging around a tower that only sometimes helps you determine where the block will land. Overall, just don't bother with this game, even if it is free.
1781162646|5.0|This book is not a horror story. If you liked The Colorado Kid, you will enjoy this book. The use of carney language helped make this book enjoyable.
B00ATDOVNK|2.0|This game is cool and all but in a way it kinda sucks CAUS u get all excited and then at the end it says u have to pay so it made me want to throw my kindle when it poped up and said please pay for full version and I'm not gonna have my mom buy this game or any other . So please g5 make some games that are completely free ! PLEASE ! :0 sincerely : ?
145210655X|4.0|Bought this for the hubs for Father's Day. He liked all the scenes, although some were cuter than others.  He is looking forward to sharing it with our son when he is old enough (he is only 18m right now).<br /><br />I think it was a good buy and although it seems like some of the panels were filler, many were funny and had very subtle references (we are nerds).  Some were downright touching.  Of course it takes great liberties with the personality of Darth Vader :-)  All in all a fun coffee table type book.  I'll enjoy explaining why the Greedo pushed me first is funny.
014241011X|4.0|Ok, this is not as good as Matilda but there are not many books that are.<br />The boy-grandmother interactions are well told the weak link is the witches who are mostly seen but not heard.
B004SIP7AS|3.0|Good quality DVD , just remember to check DVD region before you purchase a product! Happy about the quality of the product.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|It has been a long time since I have found a book this good. It's original enough to keep you reading hour after hour non-stop. That's rare lately as every other book released seams to be the same story with a different title. It feels like your holding your breath waiting on the next book. The trend lately is to produce straight to digital short stories between books which is great as long as they don't delay the main books too much. I'd love to see a couple of these while we're waiting. The only problem I've had with the series is the exceptionally long wait between books. Anyway that's just me whining.
B00000F1D3|5.0|great music.. by cher  believe is the best song yet back to the disco era... the beat is great... love it...
1781162646|2.0|I thought I was getting Stephen King.  Harry Potter was scarier.  At least it was short.  At his worst Stephen King has diarrhea of the word processer but at least there's a bang at the end.  This boring story meanders around hinting at haunted amusement park rides then fizzles out in a sentimental ending. Maybe he's writing for his grandkids now.
1451696191|3.0|This book is unique in the fact that it was written in the form of letters. I enjoyed following Charlie's life throughout that year.<br />Charlie is someone I would like to have known. He is genuinely caring and very sweet.<br />However, this book deals with some very heavy issues. Additionally, the language is pretty bad.<br />I definitely did not expect the ending of this book. It really makes you think.<br />This book is very realistic and being a high school student, I was able to relate to many parts of this book.<br />Overall I enjoyed this book- I believe I would read it again.<br />Once again, this book is definitely 'R-rated.' Although I liked this book, I would not recommend it to anyone under 16.
0590535986|5.0|Hardly any words in it which makes it fun to make them up with the pictures. Cute story about a gorilla who stole keys and let the animals out.
0374533571|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I couldn't put it down.<br />This story is written from the perspective of \\"crazy\\" Pat Peoples. It is his story of recovery after a separation from his wife and many years in a mental institution.<br />This book often mentions 'silver linings' and the ending certainly does have a silver lining.<br />I was really able to connect with this book, and I believe this book will accommodate a wide variety of tastes. However, this is definitely 'R' rated.<br />One of my favorite books of all time.
1609611543|3.0|I'll let you know if it makes sense after I see the results, my daughter is reading currently,&#34; the proof will be in the pudding&#34;
159514188X|3.0|This book is very good, and it makes you realize exactly what is going on with our youth today; however, it was very sad, and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under the age 14. It is a very depressing book.
B0000669JL|5.0|Every song on this album is a hit by itself.  Taken altogether, the title really just says it all: Legend.
1400052181|5.0|This book is the true story of one of the greatest scientific discoveries.<br />Cells were taken from a tumor in the body of a woman named Henrietta Lacks (HeLa). Now, several decades later, her cells have been used to discover treatments for numerous diseases and made the researchers and scientists working with them millions of dollars. Meanwhile, Henrietta's family lives in poverty. They were never told about the cells until many years later.<br />This book addresses the ethical problems associated with using tissue for research and informed consent. It also discusses potential racial inequalities due to the fact that the Lacks family is African American. Additionally, religion is touched upon.<br />Although this book is nonfiction, it is told from the perspective of the author. It is the story of her journey finding the information presented in this book. I couldn't put it down.<br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks really makes you think about the parts of your own life involved with medicine and science.<br />It is possible that those without a science background could have a difficult time understanding parts of the novel. However, like Deborah, a good dictionary should help you through. I thought this book was outstanding. I would read it again in a heartbeat.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I am a puzzler......I enjoy doing them on my kindle...there are a few different ones .They have beautiful pictures to choose from.....like...
0761171703|5.0|I loved this book! Not only were the photographs beautiful, Jordan Matters stories that went along with each section were inspiring. Two of my daughters are dancers, and this really made me appreciate what they do. I would have liked it a little better if the stories were about dancers rather than about the author's life, but I still loved it. This book makes me want to get up and dance!
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Loved this DVD and the movie.  This film quality looks great, love the score to this movie as well. Definitely worth getting!
B008B0QH5S|3.0|&#34;Everything Means Something&#34; is one of the finest ballads they've ever written. Apart from that, this album loses me, and I really have tried with it.<br /><br />It's hard to be the greatest, most productive pop duo in the universe. Impossible, boring expectations. Sometimes you need to take a little downtime and write some disposable songs that alternate between schmaltz and cynicism, with some barbed wire (&#34;Your Early Stuff&#34;) reserved as a preemptive strike against the occasional jerk reviewer. And so they did.
B002HEOLH0|5.0|Of course I like it. Download was fast and easy to transfer to Window's Media player and then into my phone.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This movie was awesome.  It was the perfect combination of fantasy and a love story.  Will definitely watch this one more than once.
B006RXPUR2|5.0|I love this movie. It is heartbreaking and amazing at the same time. It really pulls at you as you consider what you would do in the main characters situation. Great movie!
B00000J0O2|3.0|The print is not real dark on the light side, you can tell that its recycled but works, next time I would like better quality
B00APYKXFS|1.0|From the description I was expecting a Beat Hazzard clone, no such luck.  This game has uninspired, hard to distinguish graphis, and a non-descript &quot;soundtrack&quot;.  If you want a great space shooter, try Plasma Sky(a previous faotd), or Voxel Invaders(free).  Both of these games are great space invaders/galaga/galaxian games.  Uninstalled.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|Its a timeless classic that never gets old. Great quality and story is top notch. One of Tim Burton's best movies to date.
B005LAII80|5.0|As someone who has written comic books for many years I have to start off by saying that I am a great fan of 2000 AD and the original Judge Dredd comics.  As such, I dutifully saw the Stallone film adaptation and just as dutifully disliked it.  It wasn't a bad film--just not a Judge Dredd film.<br />This time, however, I got to see a real, honest-to-God, film about Mega-City one and the Judges who patrol it.  DREDD, played by Karl Urban, is perfect--more so because, unlike most movie stars, Urban does the entire film with the helmet on!<br /> Olivia Thirlby makes a quite interesting Judge Anderson, gifted with psychic powers she can still kick ass right alongside Dredd.<br />The film is well shot with wonderful use of 3-D and memorable secondary characters.  I know it suffered in theaters from being connected with the Stallone fiasco but be assured, this is the real deal!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Best interpretations of these songs and the way they are put together. I love the layering of the cellos and the composition of the songs and the way they build. Both Piano Guys cd's are a must. I listened to them a lot on youtube while I was pregnant and strangely enough putting these songs on calm her down when she's fussy.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|This is one of those films that really does not need to exist.  I mean nobody was clamoring for a film about the continuing adventures of Hansel and Gretel--and yet, it's not a bad idea.  It's kind of fun.  After all, the Brother's Grimm left these two in a candy cottage watching a witch burn.  What do they do for an encore?<br />This is the encore, filmed with enormous quantities of blood and foam latex.  Lots of witches, lots of ways to kill them and a one-of-a-kind Troll.<br />Give it a chance, you might enjoy yourself.
B00003CX8Y|3.0|It could have definitely done without the added musical scene &#34;Human Again&#34;. There is a good reason they left it out of the original version. I know its a kids movie but its still really campy. Though I'm particular about this movie because its based off of my favorite fairy tale. That musical scene kinda cheapened the movie for me. My vcr ate my orriginal...not happy about it.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|I have always loved the Howard Hawk's 'Thing from Another World' which I consider one of the best horror/sf films ever made.<br />The John Carpenter version delves into the John Campbell book to a far greater extent which makes it different and quite entertaining.  Doing a 'prequel' to the Carpenter version set in the Norwegian camp that first finds the creature was an interesting idea but it lacks something in its execution.  I think it might have been in characters--the Swedish, FInnish, and Norwegian actors are quite good but we do not, in some way, really bond with them.<br />Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good-looking and quite a competent actress but, for some reason, really cannot carry this film on her own.<br />It's a good try--but doesn't quite hit the mark.
0345529057|3.0|So far the books have been entertaining. I've made it through book 2 so far. It has lots of characters and political intrigue, so if that's your cup of tea this will be a good series.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|denzel does it again. he was awesome in this movie and the story was splendid. don Cheadle, bruce greenwood and john goodman did an amazing job also.
B0045HCJ9E|4.0|This film has great suspense only Hitchcock can produce in a film.<br />In addition who can beat the acting of Cary Grant?<br />Great classic fim!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I was hard pressed to decide whether to subscribe to HBO or purchase Season 1 and 2.  Settled on purchasing.  I have watched the entire 3 seasons twice and wanted to watch again, but HBO had taken off the &#34;free&#34; weekend.  I can't wait for Season 3 to go to DVD.  Each time I watched these episodes, I heard and noticed something different.  This is the first time I have watched this genre and am hooked.
B004ZG5F0K|5.0|I actually accidentally saw this film late one night on T.V.<br /><br />I cried and cried and cried. After seeing it I had to find a copy for all of my children and grand children to see.<br />We need truthful heart wrenching films like this to remind us of how wrong society can get if its citizen's<br /> aren't  watchful.<br /><br />I turned to Amazon in hopes of finding this movie...yes!, there it was.<br />Get it..watch it... Don't miss this wake-up call.
B00APYKXFS|4.0|This game is good if you give a chance. it's difficult but that is part of it's allure. Anti gravity clears the screen of the red blobs. lazy players make for unnecessary bad reviews. I have a horribly short attention span. this game kept me busy for a little while. not as bad as the one star reviews say.
B00APYKXFS|4.0|This game really reminds me of Plasma Sky.<br />Similar principle and controls but I give it four stars because it's entertaining.<br />Keeps my trigger finger happy.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|This is the worst game ever.  A blind person probably designed this game, try and figure this mess out.  P.o.s
B000FBJHZS|5.0|The book was interesting from beginning to end.  I LOVE picking up little bits of info from novels and this book gave me plenty of insight!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Yeah the app is cool, but it is also deceiving, being that no where does it say trial version before downloading. Full app costs $10, which is a little more than free.
0810989956|5.0|The boys have loved it - even work on it quite often.  I love watching them write and work on the book as well.  I may not like Wimpy Kid much, but I am glad they are writing and thinking.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I never got the chance to play the card game.  This is easy to learn, and hard to put down.
B00486070K|5.0|This is a very well design product. It works perfectly with my macbook air. Continue making good product, Apple! Cheers
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This concert makes you want to go see them live!!!  Love the extras included in this DVD.  The sonds bring back great memories.
1439153663|3.0|This story started out so well that I wanted to stay up all night and read it. It, unfortunately, became gruesome<br />and unpleasant, mostly with the introduction of Mr. Waters, whose obnoxious behavior is never quite spelled out,<br />but is, obviously, the cause of most everyone's downfall.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Lots of fun! I play it all data time. Very smooth. Cool tricks. They need to make it for Xbox 360 or ps3
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game was entertaining but easy. Wish there were more levels. If you have played these types of games in the past, you will get hang of it quickly.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It is a game that makes you use your brain and the graphics are terrific, well done, I look forward to trying more of your games.
B005PK1G76|5.0|this fits on my peg perego book stroller perfectly.  it is perfect for holding two drinks, plus keys, cell phones and whatever else in the middle.  it does not feel flimsy.  i love it, and the price is right!
B007R21JJK|5.0|Main reason I went with GA is that its compatible with mac os with some fiddling to get things to run properly assuming all parts purchased are mac compatible.<br /><br />I haven't gone that route only because im comfortable using windows 8, I think some time down the line ill play around with it but right now I need something that works without fail.<br /><br />This board doesn't have a whole lot of things but just enough to be pleased for its price point.<br /><br />It seems a little difficult to post with 3770k. I had troubles and needed help so I took it to Microcenter and the guys there got it to boot no problem. so big ups to them for their services.<br /><br />Overall I would go with Gigabyte again.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|This game really sucks! Your enemy and your ship is the same color  it's really confusing. The only thing that I like is the graphic. The controls is good but but other than the two of those everything sucks. If you want a success game you guys should add a tutorial and oh by the way don't confuse the people whose playing the game.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series and lacked the 3rd season so now have a complete set right now.  Looking forward to the 4th series too this fall.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|This is a really great action movie flick, and I am glad it's an alternate universe.<br />However, even in an alternate universe, basic science and common sense should be present!<br />The plot is so unrealistic but the action and adventure overshadow all the nonsensical things that take place.<br />I really enjoyed watching it, but afterwards, thinking about it, it was really Idiotic.<br />Hah!
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|Countdown to Extinction is one of the best Megadeth albums to date.  The live cd is packed full of songs from the album and some from previous albums.  Great all around package.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|This could have been a great movie but only turned out to be a good one. Watch the Deleted Scenes for more backstory.<br />The story telling starts out great, gets lost in the middle, then returns by the end.<br />The middle part could have been done better, but this is not the Classic Captain America, but rather the Ultimates story.<br />All in all, a very solid movie in the Marvel Universe of films.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was great!  Funny and smart.  I kinda want to be her.  Or be her best friend.  (Too weird?)  ;-)
0375842209|5.0|I picked up this book because it came highly recommended by friends, I was a little doubtful at first because it is a slow read and the beginning is a little hard to get through but push through - I am SO glad I did. At around page 100 the story grabbed me and won me over. It honestly is a brilliant literary work.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This app is ok. When I first downloaded it, it didn't work properly. After re-starting it a few times, it worked better and I havent had any issues with it since.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|Purchased this as a gift - it has been played over and over - so glad I purchased this - child enjoyed it very much.
B000001IQH|3.0|rancid are cool, they put out some decent tunes, i was never a huge fan, but like what they did for the scene, even some of the offshoot bands that tim and lars have been part of.
B00B4VXQC8|2.0|JUST NOT TOO HAPPY WITH THE CD...JUST IS NOT UP TO THE STANDARDS I AM USED TO FROM 'JOVI' WISH I HAD LISTENED TO A FEW SONGS FIRST,NEVER HAD DONE THAT IN THE PAST (HAVE ALL THEIR CD'S) STILL LOVE THEM!!! THEY HAVE BEEN MY FAVORITE BAND SINCE THEY STARTED...I WILL JUST MAKE SURE TO LISTEN TO SAMPLE SONGS FIRST FROM NOW ON...VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THE SONGS...
B000QJLQY4|5.0|Luckily few of Kawasaki's tips I had already put in practice thanks to home education and school/university/mba outstanding masters.  However, this comprehensive compendium of all principles an entrepreneur must bear in mind to succeed, in one single book, with Guy's special enchant, is just a life present.<br /><br />Must read for every serious entrepreneur.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|its really fun with the cool monsters u can battle and the bosses u can fight like the dragon and the giants
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|This is a must see movie.  Ignore the critics and their negative reviews. This is truly a great movie to watch.
B009DJB8I2|4.0|An odd contraption of electronical music that perfectly capture the atmosphere in the game. Alas, partly a little too odd for the more normal listeners. A big plus is that the Portal 1 song is along too.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I just lost three hours of my day playing this game! I am certain to loose many more!!! This could be bad!!  I am going to tell everyone about this!
B00475AYJQ|3.0|Like the story, writing style somewhat geared to adolescent boys, could be a good book if not so self involved, good plot, takes forever to get to the point, lots of self congratulation but still interesting despite all that. Waiting for the third book to get on with it. Not like a traditional trilogy as he just keeps you waiting, and waiting to get to the point rather than building on a good established story. Guess I'll have to wait with the rest of us to see if it was worth it as it seems like he is building to a huge climax. Hope it is worth the wait.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Took me a bit to get into the book.  When I did I couldn't put it down.<br />Onto boom two..
0307454541|3.0|Some of the detail of the sexual parts could be left out or restated in a way as not to be so offensive, best selling authors can write books time after time without graphic sex why not this book?
B0063M22QO|1.0|If you're are going to offer a game make it easy to load<br />I do no see why I need to add 7 more words. I believe I got my point across.
030745455X|3.0|The story line is ok, the graphic details go beyond what needs to be printed. It could have been presented differently and been even better than it was as written.  Many of the truly good writers have best sellers and have no sex in them whatsoever.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Lots of action, hunky leading men-good and evil, good cast all around, and lots of fun and entertainment that doesn't force you to think.  Just enjoy.
0062238868|5.0|This country has been robbed of a great American hero and his wife and family most of all endures the pain of living without Chris!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|You don't even have to have a plot in this movie.  It is pure eye candy, so what's not to love?  Still, there's lots of action, classic good and evil components, conflict of characters, truly funny moments of plain old narcissism, and plenty of camera time for all.  Just make sure you get the wide screen edition--it's just better.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Though the non-linear style is a bit confusing at first, the intertwining stories are lovely. As they near completion and combination, the delight deepens.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|A beautiful story with passion and intrigue, and suspense, I fell in love with this author and her characters the moment I read her Guild Hunter her Psy/Changeling series, can't wait for more.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Great fast paced game. It puts ones mind into overdrive which admittedly took some getting used to. once I understood the game and its parameters I did well and still stayed challlenged .  I highly reccomend it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Amazing puzzles, couldn't stop playing. Will be buying the next room! Kept me playing and that's hard to do. Can't wait for the next one!
B00007BKVC|3.0|Nearly twenty-five years after it's release, Thelma & Louise is still heralded as a classic, and is on most critics best films list. For years I'd heard about how outrageous and empowering this film is, but I'd never seen it in it's entirety. I've seen bits and pieces on cable and seen parodies of it, but I really never saw anything that made me want to watch it. The story is an interesting one about these two ladies who go on a weekend vacation. The ladies go drinking and partying, which gets them into some trouble and leads to them going on the run. This is one of those films that has those classic moments that really shine over the rest of the film. I found Thelma & Louise to be quite forgettable, but it's those particular scenes that will stay with me. The cast was in class all it's own and I think that's why the critics loved this film so much. Thelma & Louise may have been revolutionary for 1992, but in 2013, it's really not all that extreme, and in the years since, there have been so many copycats, that it's hard to differentiate it from all the similar stories that came after it. Geena Davis is just unbelievably good as Thelma. I love Geena Davis, I think she's extremely underrated, and it's her performance that makes this film work. How she doesn't win the Oscar for her portrayal of Thelma is beyond me. Susan Sarandon wasn't bad either, she's not really known for comedy and too me, she'll always be the one who prevented Bull Durham from being THE ultimate baseball film, but she was impressive. The cast member that was most interesting to me, was the young drifter, played by a good looking newcomer named Brad Pitt. In his first major film, Brad Pitt was so much different from the man we know today, it really showed the age of this film and just how much things can change in a relatively short period of time. It's hard to believe, but it was almost exactly five years after this films release that he starred in Se7en. As I said previously, this film is considered to be one of the best films of all time and it's gain that reputation because of it's performances and stand out scenes. Thelma & Louise have their moments on their little adventure, but in the end, it's familiar, predictable, and forgettable.
B004ZJZQFG|4.0|Enigma, and the cracking of German code is a huge part of the War against the Nazi's, that has been sorely neglected.<br />Please listen to the Directors comments as well. He is not kind to the inference that the men of Das Boot were just mainline sailors doing their jobs.<br /><br />Great acting, plot, and theme.
6305428050|5.0|Funny storyline. It is an old favorite. Enjoyed all the mishaps they get into and how they get out of them.
B006LSZECO|3.0|After seeing this book on bestseller list I finally decided I had to read it. IT'S &#34;JUST OKAY &#34;. I have no idea how it stayed on the best seller kist for over a year though, I have found numerous typos, some of it boring taking me a long tome to get thru not a page turner at all. The jumping back and forth, just not what I expected. Will have to finish it to make a complete review but right now not into it.
B003UYV08E|1.0|I will later on, maybe next month, I still like to get it Thanks, but right now I can't pay for it, I will reorder it soon, Thanks again G Fisher.<br /> you all.
B004V6BQ3O|4.0|I use the 5200 mainly for video work. The on board mic's are not good enough for decent quality sound. This mic works very well with the DX5200 and brings the sound quality to an acceptable/usable level. Usually, I also use a seperate audio recording device. But if you want to shoot video with your Nikon, and also want decent quality audio, this is a great addition to the camera.  Nikon also says it helps cut down on the auto-focus motor noise. It does help, but isn't perfect.<br /><br />I would recommend this mic to anyone shooting video with a Nikon. Great value for the price.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game. It is perfect for all ages. The HD graphics are beautiful! When you are playing you just feel like you are there with the beautiful creatures.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Completely addictive and way better than regular Temple Run.  I love that you can travel to the different lands, the graphics are beautiful.  Now if I can just figure out how to avoid those darn swooping monkeys!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and you guys should enjoy it to and I'm just giving a review to just get something
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this app it is so much fun. there are six people to choose from and you can cut and color there hair. its a great game for all ages.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is just the best shooting game I have ever played it makes u think your playing call of duty it is a good game it is worth money
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a pretty cool game for free. Would recommend this game to anyone. Wish there were more to each level. Definitely going to play again.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|Works well with RDP and VNC.  Is relatively easy to navigate a full computer desktop on a very small screen (phone).
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is lots of fun my husband is playing it on his Ilario and we are going to see how can get futher
0985081821|4.0|I love a good witch story and The Forever Girl book 1 Sophia's Journey is no let down!<br /> The Forever Girl is a wonderfully written book that contains everything a good paranormal should.  I do not think I have read a book where the main charter goes through so many life changing events so quick. Sophia has a hard time just being herself. She is Wiccan and the town outcast.  Whenever there is trouble the finger is pointed at her. Friendships are tested while Sophia learns who she truly is and the power that come with.  Falling deep into a world of magic and mystery that she did not even know existed.  Learning to love someone she did not think she could.  There are many surprises that had my jaw dropping and sitting on the edge of my seat turning pages to see what happened.<br />Rebecca Hamilton has done a wonderful job describing ritual, as well as Wiccan beliefs accurately. For her insight and research, I applaud and give her much respect.<br />All the characters were well-developed and well written. Hamilton captured the relationship between Charles and Sophia perfectly. World building is great. This novel was a real treat to read and a total surprise.  I am very happy I picked this book up and I will defiantly be read the second installment of the Forever Girl series!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is just like Bejeweled with a bit of extra thrown in! Great way to pass time at the Dr.s office!
B005KELQEU|5.0|I didn't want a protective cover that would automatically turn my Paperwhite on when opened; or, fold out and transform into a bookstand.  I certainly didn't want to spend way too much for something colorful that might match my stellar fashion sense.  I preferred not to add any weight or bulk to an Ereader that appealed to me for it's small size and light load.  I needed an unassuming SLEEVE to safeguard my Kindle. This Belkin was on sale, it's black, it's padded inside at every point of contact, the zippers display quality in manufacturing as do the outer fabrics used.  The Kindle Paperwhite fits like a glove. I'm giving it ALL five stars.
B007SPPANM|4.0|The story is altered from the first versions but none the less it was a very nice dvd and I enjoy it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is loads of fun it's so easy and great for kids and adults it keeps attention but be careful once you start playing you won't want to stop.
B00992CF6W|1.0|i don't know how people this crap. it is obviously worse game there is and I like minecraft.instead of paying seven dollars you should get seven dollar back!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app minecraft is the best thing in the world and the best app I have played in my life
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I had forgotten I had preordered this and was really happy to have it show up in my kindle ap.  It was a fast read with interesting and well developed characters.
B00CBKXGPI|2.0|I really like this concept and enjoyed playing the small amount it allowed. I was unable to get very&nbsp;far in the game because it shuts down on my galaxy 4 s. I'm an art history major and found this game intriguing. I would continue playing if the developers could fix the bugs but for now, I must give a bad rating and uninstall.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|LOVED IT!!!!! Awesome job!!! I love how there is a lot of confusion but to the reader everything ties together and makes sense!(:
B00DL479DS|2.0|The film focuses on the manipulative Christine (Rachel McAdams) who heads the London branch of an ad agency. She desires to get transferred to NY. She has no problem talking credit for Isabel's (Noomi Rapace) ideas. Dirk (Paul Anderson) completes the third side of this love triangle. Isabel attempts to fight back, but is no match for Christine. The back and forth smartly escalates until there is a murder. At this point the film moves from a straight forward film to a who-dun-it, did they really do it mess which caused me to lose interest and enjoyment.<br /><br />Brian De Palma fans will see similarities to his other works, which I though superior. Decent acting and plot, but it wasn't my cup of tea.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, brief nudity (Noomi Rapace)
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|The graphics are very good. Fun to play when you have down time and want to unwind especially for dinosaur fans and fans of the movie.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|The battle between the witches was the best part of this movie - not the ACTUAL battle scenes but the brewing of trouble between them and the jealousy that caused Theodora's demise.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and had high expectations as well so this was hard to live up to.<br />Keeping with certain themes and departing in others, I enjoyed the contrasts and similarities between the original and this movie.<br />Michelle Williams was captivating and embodied Glinda so well.<br />Mila was amazing as well!  Oh - so scary once she turned!<br />Zach Braff's character wasn't as cheesy as I thought it would be and I really enjoyed him in this film when I've never been a fan before.<br />To me, this movie was just plain good entertainment with great casting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Beware Temple Run 2 is even more additive than the original Temple run. Super fun RUN!!! Jump!!! Duck!!! Get your battery charger out.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|This book is ok for a &#34;brainless&#34; read. It didn't take a lot of concentration while reading and was good for a before bed read.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I absolutely love Sophie Kinsella's books. Once I start reading I can't put them down.  This is by far one of favorites!
B0067R0APK|5.0|I have a few weather apps, but for cost of many of the other weather apps, I will have to say that for the quality and cost this is the best. I have had no problems moving it to another device. Thanks AccuWeather. M.E.M.  ,Florida
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Explosions?  Yes.<br />Car chase scenes?  Yes.<br />Helicopters?  Yes.<br />Foreigners who can speak English?  Yes.<br />Yippee ki yay mother xxxxx?  Yes.<br /><br />Bottom line- Watch this movie if you like all of the above.  This movie requires no thinking.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I give this five stars because it is very well written and keeps you into it through the whole book. Even the parts that aren't full of action are really good because of how they are written. Very clever book.
B00BOXZAG6|2.0|The 3D graphics are horrible. The story is stupid. I bought it because of the two rave reviews.<br />These guys must be on crack! A big waste of money.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Lots of fast moving fun highly addictive and challenging.  I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a way to pass the time.
076115678X|5.0|This book gives great tips on how to care and love your curls.  For someone who has a mix between curly and straight hair, depending on what my hair wants to do that day, I am able to apply these tips to make my look complete. I learned things I never knew about my curly hair.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love to read and the app is on my phone so convienint all right there,all the books that I could want and the store that is always stocked, and no carring the books, whats not to love.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|What can I say about this movie? The trailers sure do not do it justice. You have have to experience this movie for yourself. It reminds me of a Avatar for kids, with it's stunning visuals, sound, and music. I saw it and 3D and felt it was not tacky or over used. It just enhanced the movie just that much more. The voice acting was great, but nothing special. Anyone could have played Eep and Eep's mom, but that is not saying they didn't fit. There are some monuments in this movie that will warm your heart and then break it. I really enjoyed this movie, bit it is not for everyone. If you take your kids or don't you would still enjoy it. Your kids will love it and I believe you will to. I suggest renting it first to see if you like it enough to buy it.
B00005B1W7|4.0|The DVD was very good, no gliches or problems viewing it.  This is a good buy for a good movie and the price was good as well.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I like this cd a lot. I am keeping  it in my CD player in my car and have been listening to it when I drive.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|If you have a first gen Fire, it won't install and eats all your memory, refusing to release it even though it won't install.  This is a disaster.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|If I was rating on features alone, it would get 5 stars, but it didn't fit well in my ear. The earbud didn't go into my ear with any of the provided tips. Gave it to my boyfriend and he's pretty happy with it.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|The last 45 min of the movie just didn't make sense. I just couldn't see it happening in real life. I sat through the whole movie but in the end I just though the movie was sloppy.
B005KELW26|4.0|The latch has come loose a couple of times but overall I would say this product is pretty good.  The color is exactly what was shown and the case itself is well made.
B00APYKXFS|3.0|Good game for its visuals and options and all, but it remains a solid 3 until a tutorial can explain the chaos.  I msde all the way to Stage 7 on my second try, but I have no idea how or whyI got there.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun to play and makes you think.  Can't great better then free.  Glad I got it and really enjoyed it. Satisfied all around.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can you escape is an interesting game. I enjoyed the challenge of solving puzzles and seeking hidden objects to move to the next challenge.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book kept my attention from beginning to the end. I would highly recommend this book to be read by anyone.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot and look forward to the movie coming out later this year. I've recommended this series to many of my friends and family already. A good read for teens+ and adults alike.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|The recording quality is very good and I like the 80s sound. It has all the greatest hits that I know about.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy and convenient to use. It's on my Android and my Kindle. I use it many times during my day.
B0002BO05S|5.0|I love movies like this and these stories about the bible are really good to watch. for every body. Watch tehm
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book sooo much. All of the thoughts the author brought to mind made me think about life differently. I couldn't put it down.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game only has two levels that you can do for free and the graphics and hair styling effects are terrible.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|decent way to kill a few minutes. makes you think. I don't typically write reviews, so now I'm just trying to get to the minimum word count.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I have simple needs so this suits me perfectly.  I can look up the weather in my area and get a decent forecast.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm going to miss this series, always looked forward to Ms. Harris' latest installment.  This kept me engrossed and I didn't mind the ending, except that it is the ending!  These stories are so much more fun than the HBO version!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great for teens who want to read something that has depth and character. This is a recommended piece of literature. Easy read
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This story is very touching and reflects on time troubles (example when daisy died) it reminded me of how my dog died and how I was sad too. The part at the cornfield when Jack,miles,Henry,and Amos saved each other including August and how he lost half of his sweeter and hearing aids. How brave he was. My last thing is how summer was really nice to August and when at Savannah Halloween party they asked to stipulating out with August and to be more popular like she was. Summer refused to. This book is a must read <3
B00A9ET4SG|5.0|A truly wonderful read!  Make sure you have time to read this book from cover to cover when you begin.
0307960471|4.0|Phantom is not a feel good novel--it is a Norwegian crime novel, one that spares no dark detail, no grisly particular.  This novel is the first Harry Hole I've read and while there are occasional references to characters and events from (what I imageine are) the earlier novels, I do not feel that I missed anything by starting in the middle.  I was curious to see what all the fuss was about--Harry Hole is definitely an compelling anti-hero and if you like the Stieg Larsson series, or even works by Michael Connelly (or similar authors) you should definitely read this series (at least based on this novel).  To be honest--I prefer psychological thrillers over this sort of novel, so I likely won't read another.  However, I would recommend this to readers who enjoyed the Larsson/Connelly works.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|Great book. I've read Goldacre's previous book Bad Science and loved it, so I was looking forward to reading this one. It was fun to read while being completely depressing.
1781162646|5.0|Oh my gosh!  This is what long time Stephen King fans have been waiting for! Joyland is a return to the writing style that drew us to the author in early days of his career.  To be honest, I stopped reading Stephen King when his novels became more and more bizarre.  In a magnificent return to his original writing style, Stephen King's latest novel takes us back to a time when a good book required nothing more than an excellent plot, memorable characters, a good mystery and yes, perhaps a hint of the supernatural.  Available only in hard copy, King forces us to go out and \\"buy the book.\\"  Rightfully so.  I absolutely loved it!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I can usually breeze through these books if the storyline keeps my interest.  This one, not so much.  I really thought this was the last of a \\"trilogy\\".  No.... there is 2 more.  I sure hope they  keep my attention and end with a \\"bang\\".  Pardon the pun.  I also hope we don't have to wait almost a year for it.  This one was not worth the wait.  I will read reviews of the others and try to decide if the next 2 are worth reading.  I feel like Sylvia Day is either having writer's block or is trying to ride the $$ wagon as long as she can with this series. Like many, I thought this was the last of the Trilogy.  I was being nice when I gave it 3 stars.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Great back up band makes this album a good re-creation of the Beach Boys in their prime. Amazing how good they sound after 50 years!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|The next installment of the Die Hard series finds John McClane (Willis) traveling to Russia to help out his seemingly wayward son, Jack, only to discover that Jack is a CIA operative working to prevent a nuclear-weapons heist, causing the father and son to team up against underworld forces.<br /><br />The original Die Hard is one of my favorite action flicks of its time when it came out and the sequels including this one have yet to live up to the original. However if you are a fan of the series of movies, you know exactly what you are going to get, over the top action and somewhat unrealistic car chases and shootouts. Going into this knowing that and suspending your belief in reality a bit and you will enjoy this movie for what it is, good popcorn fare. This movie has almost become a parody of the original though and it is a shame they keep repeating a similar plot with each new iteration of the Die Hard series.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the movie is the script, who is writing these lines?? How many times is McClane gonna say &#34;Jesus&#34; and &#34;I am on vacation&#34;. Those quickly became annoying and detracted from the movie.<br /><br />Even with that, I did like the movie. It is not going to be a classic by any means but I do wish if Willis is going to do another Die Hard, please please bring in a quality story and some better script writers with something new.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was completely captivated by this book.  It resonated on many different levels and was many things: a beautiful love story, a complicated, layered, complex journey and a thoroughly enjoyable escape.  Loved it.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|This is a great flick to watch but the sound seemed to go up and down however it was still nice to see George in his prime.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|I am addicted to playing Mah Jong. I have the free version and liked it so much, I bought this.<br /><br />But, the Black Dragon level is not winnable. Game 14 cannot be accessed. Each time I try to play it, the game freezes. I can't access it from the menu or by going forward from the previous game. Very frustrating all around. Plus, there are only 164 games. Sure, you can reset or just replay over and over, but why?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was really glad to find this app. It is great. Large easy to read and simple to use. I do bookkeeping and has history so I can check back on previous calculations.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|I wish I could afford to buy everyone a copy of this book. It is just that important! I have been eating Plant Strong for almost two years and this was the missing link. Anyone who wants to maintain their weight and not 'diet', but want to enjoy their food and not feel deprived, should get this book and forever be liberated from the diet yo-yo!
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|This has to be one of the best cases I have ever bought off of amazon. I love it. It's so slim yet you can feel how protective it is. And I got it in the dodger blue and I just love it. BEST CASE EVER!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is my absolute favorite bingo game that i have found. I love that i always have lots of power ups and lots of keys to open chest.
0783225733|4.0|I found the story fascinating and was absolutely gripped as the climax unfolded. Really good acting by all parties made it a delightful movie too.<br /><br />One unsettling thing is how white they make this time period. Yes, that may have been how it actually was around the space program, but it's disturbing how people of color were not a part of the story at all.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Kids love the game. Recommend putting time restrictions on it as they would play all day if I let them
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|This Evil Dead is the standout horror film of the year so far.  It takes what was so great about the original and makes it better.  The effects and acting far surpass the original.  Good for fans of the original and horror lover's everywhere.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This gave is really fun and has a lot of interesting animals that you rescue and release into the wild
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's almost like taking care of a horse it never crashes and its awesome so get this app  you'll love it
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Fluid writing style and wonderful character development. Engaging from beginning to end.  I found this to be the most hopeful of his three books. An insightful look into a different culture.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. It kept me interested and I have been looking for more games that are similar every since. I cannot<br />wait until the upgrade!
B008MF3OEY|5.0|Beautiful and very satisfying to use. It fits perfectly, tightly and is a joy to carry around with all the kindle books. If you can find it, you'll like it.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Great game if you enjoy having to focus, take notes and think. Just wish there were more levels available. Curious as to if they will add more soon.
B00B52F278|5.0|Spartacus is one of the best series of all time. I have watched the entire series at least a dozen times on on-demand, and still can't wait to own the whole set! While much has been said about the slaves and the their Roman foes, I would say that the conflict between Ilthiya and Lucretia is one the most compelling aspect of the first two seasons. These two women are truly evil & deadly without ever touching a weapon. Watching these two plot and scheme against each other, and everyone else, was half the show. I loved \\"War of the Damned\\", but their presence was definitely missed. How neither Viva or Lucy were nominated for emmys is outrageous. And no one, absolutely no one, can curse and rage in Roman like John Hannah. Who needs Shakespeare when you have Batiatus! The prequel was genius to bring Batiatus & Lucretia back.<br />And take it easy on Liam, the man got his dream job in the worst way. He had to replace the unreplacable Andy Whitfield, and no matter what he did people were going to have a problem with it. He definitely comes into his own in \\"Vengeance\\",though the replacement for Naevia never really made it her own. Much preferred the original. If you haven't seen \\"Spartacus\\" yet, do yourself a favor and buy it now!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app whenever I need to just jot something down. It's fun, easy to use, free, what else is there to say? :)
0446615625|5.0|The Camel Club is the first of several books about the Camel Club, and gives an excellent introduction to the characters and how the Camel Club was formed, although if you read them without this being first, it's still very enjoyable.  It has an great story line, and importantly for me,  well developed characters with different personalities and behaviors, including one who is brilliant but has OCD.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Never saw the Bourne movies in the theater, so these were really a treat to see uncut and without interruption.  Didn't stray too far from Ludlum original storyline, but in either genre you shouldn't be disappointed.
0670014893|5.0|The mark of a supremely good writer in the genre of political thrillers must certainly be the ability to develop a creditable  plot and tenable characters regardless of the decade in which the book is written.  I am continually amazed at John LeCarre's ability to encompass modern issues within the context of his excellent novels.  His Cold War series is legendary.  He continues this fine tradition as he tackles issues like policing the actions of multinational corporations in \\"The Perfect Gardener\\" and global terrorism in this wonderful book.  If you love LeCarre, you will not be disappointed by the intelligence and believability of \\"A Delicate Balance\\".  I highly recommend this novel.
0440241901|3.0|Predictable but enjoyable chic lit!<br /><br />I could predict every twist and turn in the road to happy coupledom just by reading the back blurb, but the characters are likeable enough and the book is infused with enough humour that going along for the ride is pleasurable.<br /><br />I knew what I was getting and it was delivered in style! If you have enjoyed Kinsella's other books, I think you'd enjoy this one too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|There was a class of nobility in England that didn't have the first clue as to what it would have been like not to be well off.  Their power and influence was so great and they were quite sheltered from working class society.  Downton Abbey gives us a glimpse into this life of the very affluent.  The characters are well developed (unlike my writing) and enjoyable to follow.  I don't want to give anything away to those that have not seen the third season but I will say I am a little disappointed at the sacrifice of one of my favorite characters.<br /><br />Anyway, if they keep producing them, I will keep watching.
